        "Question: Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning. How are you?",
        "Q: I\u2019m just fine and how are you?",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: Good. Can you tell me when and where you were born?",
        "A: I was born Ioannina, Greece, in 1930.",
        "Q: And tell me a little about your family.",
        "A: My family are -- if we go back a few generations, they have been in Ioannina for I would say\nhundreds of years. And my father\u2019s family was mainly in the wine and cheese business. And my\ngrandfather on the part of my mother, he was a merchant.",
        "Q: And what did your father do?",
        "A: My father was an employee of the national bank of Greece.",
        "Q: And did your mother work as well?",
        "A: No, at that time women were minding their own houses, and they have maids to the do the\nwork, and they were very happy that way.",
        "Q: Were you fairly well off as a family?",
        "A: I would say upper middle class.",
        "Q: So did you have maids in the house?",
        "A: My parents, yes. One. One maid.",
        "Q: And how long did you live in --",
        "A: In -- in Ioannina for five years, and then my father was transferred to Arta and then Preveza,\nand in 1940 we were in Agrini.",
        "Q: And why -- why were you moving so many times?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably the bank would do it with this -- their employees.",
        "Q: And what is your earliest memories of your family?",
        "A: I remember everything that happened from 1935 on, I have a very clear memory of\neverything.",
        "Q: Were you conscious of the fact even though you were only six years old in 1936, of st --\nthings that were going on in Germany? Did you remember hearing things about the Nazis?",
        "A: From -- we knew that there were Jews who were passing from Greece on their way to\nPalestine or other places. And I remember in 1938 a friend of my father told him that in case of\nneed, I would like you to change your identity and you and your family go to the house of my\nfather in a remote mountain village.",
        "Q: Did you think that was a possibility? Did your family think that was really going to happen?",
        "A: Well, at that time seeing what it was happening in Germany, and seeing that we had a fascist\ndictatorship in Greece, everything was possible, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you experience anti-Semitism as a young boy? This is before the Italians came,\nbefore the Germans came.",
        "A: No, the -- the first time I was aware that there was something different if you are a Jew, was\nwhen I was going to the Jewish school, and we went for a parade, and then, although we came to\nthe staging point quite early, we had to wait and I didn\u2019t like that. So I told the teacher why are\nwe waiting, and other schools have come after us and they pass. And the teacher, who happened\nto be a Christian, said we are the Jewish school, that\u2019s why we have to wait. So I realized that\nbeing a Jew was not a good thing.",
        "Q: Did that bother you?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Did you go home and talk to your parents about it, or --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: And did you talk with the other kids about it, or wa -- this was --",
        "A: My -- I don\u2019t remember that either.",
        "Q: When you moved to Agrinio in 1940, yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There were very few Jews in that town.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, there were only 40 Jews in Agrinio, while there were almost 2000 in Ioannina,\nso there was a big difference. Agrinio was called also Vrahori, or Evraiohori, which means a\nJewish village. Why? Because in 1821, there were 200 Jewish families in Agrinio. And what\nhappened to these 200 Jewish families, I think has significant meaning and it explains in my\nopinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War. I counted in\nthe Yad Vashem list something like 124 names plus 40 spouses. And in my experience, I know\nof 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in that list, and they are not. But still the numbers\nare very small. And then, in addition to that, the losses of the Greek Jews were great. 89 percent\nwere transported outside of Greece and 87 percent were killed, or 67,000 Jews. So what\nhappened in 1821 was a very little known historic event. The Turks killed in Istanbul the Greek\npatriarch of Constantinople. And they forced four Jewish porters to throw his body to the sea.\nWhen this became known to what was then Greece, and at that time Greece was much smaller\nthan it is now, the 5000 Jews of Greece were massacred. A few who survived were converted to\nChristianity. One of the leaders of the Greek nation, Kanellos Deligiannis was a great righteous\nGentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews whom he hid in his house in Tripolitsa. The anti-\nJewish feelings of the population were so strong that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12\nJews hidden in his house for three years. And only in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to\nthe Ionian Island of Zakinthos which it was not then under Greek control. So, going back to\nAgrinio and the 40 Jews, these people have come mainly from Arta. There were many small\nmerchants and one of them was a teacher who during the war became one of the five leaders of\nthe resistance in our area. His name was Yunas Munis. I would say about Agrinio that Agrinio\nhas the distinct honor of being possibly the only city in German occupied Europe where all the\nJews did not obey any German regulations and they all survived. And I really can\u2019t think of any\nother city where something like that happened, but I should say that we were very fortunate that\nwe did not have a rabbi, and we did not have any community leaders, because in Greece the\nrabbis and community leaders, with one or two very rare exceptions proved to be totally\nincapable of facing the problems that the German occupation presented.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you move to Agrinion before the Italians attacked Greece?",
        "A: That -- that -- that\u2019s correct, the -- we moved in Agrinion sometime in March of 1940, and\nyeah, Italy attacked Greece on October 28\", 1940. About this war I would like to say that the\nJewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great. Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the\narmy, and that included my father and many of my relatives. Over 500 were killed, including a\ncousin of my mother\u2019s. Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least two or three of our\nrelatives. To these numbers I would like to add the 1,600 Jewish Palestinian volunteers who\nserved with the British expeditionary force. And one of them was the father of the former Prime\nMinister of Israel, Shimon Peres, and he was not able to be evacuated with the British and he\nbecame a partisan of ELAS.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek\nJewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with his troops, stopped the Italian advance, giving the\nallies their first victory of the second World War. Mordechai Frizis was killed.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know when this happened, you joined a national youth organization that was actually a\nfascist organization --",
        "A: Ah, yes, that -- that\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- can you --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s quite --",
        "Q: -- talk about that some?",
        "A: -- yes. In Agrinion we were only two Jewish boys among 1,000 students in the -- the high\nschool. And I\u2019m grateful to the people who were in charge, because every able bodied boy was a\nmember of the youth -- the fascist youth organization. And I\u2019m grateful to them for not knowing\nthat Jews were not allowed to join that fascist organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join\nthem. I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started.",
        "Q: And why were you glad that no one kicked you out, or --",
        "A: Because I never liked to be discriminated against. So being a fascist suit me fine, although I\ndid not realize that it was so bad at that time.",
        "Q: And what were you doing in the organization? O -- th-they obviously didn\u2019t talk about Jews\nor do racial things, did they?",
        "A: No, no, they -- they did not. They -- w-we would parade, we would -- we -- we had lectures\nabout Greek nationalism. Th-There was nothing offensive as far as I know at that time, you\nknow, about th-this organization.",
        "Q: So you were about 10 years old?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how long were you in that group?",
        "A: Until October 1940.",
        "Q: So when the Italians attacked?",
        "A: Yes, then the school actually closed, and we were very glad that the classes ended, without\nrealizing what the war meant.",
        "Q: So school closed in October --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or November.",
        "A: And a -- when the war started it closed, and then it started again in -- in other buildings, some\nwarehouses, because the school buildings were used as hospitals.",
        "Q: So did you then go back to school?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And with the same teachers and the same kids?",
        "A: Yes, everything the same.",
        "Q: So the fact that there were two Jewish students in the high school, the Italians did not kick out\nthe Jewish students?",
        "A: The Italians? F-First of all, remember that the war started on October 28\", but the -- and the\nGermans attacked in April of 1941. Only after that time the Germans first, and the Italians\nsecond, came. The Italians were excellent in Greece. While in Italy the 50,000 Jews lost their\ncivil rights in 1938 with Mussolini\u2019s Aryan manif -- manifesto, in Greece, thanks to the Italian\ncommander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all civil liberties. The -- we were able to -- to go\nto -- to the -- to school, while the Italians were not able to do that. Actually there were 94 Italian\nuniversity professors who were dismissed, five Italian Jewish admirals, and five Italian Jewish\ngenerals who were dismissed. But in Greece we enjoyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to\ncooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, the German general in the persecution of the\nJews. So we were very happy with the Italians, and we -- we lived a very normal life in the\nItalian zone, business was as usual, we went to the movies, and my mother was making cookies\nwhich a neighbor of hers, Maria Demardi used to send to partisan hospitals, once the partisan\nmovement became stronger.",
        "Q: So between 1940 and 1942, life does not change very much.",
        "A: Life was absolutely beautiful for us under the -- under the Italians. And there -- there was one\nmoment that the Italians asked us to register, and none thought anything of it, and they\nregistered, and I know of only one person from Preveza who did not trust the Italians, only one.\nAnd he took his parents and went into hiding. Th-That\u2019s how he survived later on the Germans.\nBut we registered. And -- I\u2019m ashamed to say that. And 30 years later I found out that Mussolini\nmade a deal with the Germans that they were supposed to -- to arrest us, and move us to camps\nin the Ionian Islands and Italy. But of course, you know, Italy capitulated and this did not\nhappen, but the Germans came.",
        "Q: You know, you wrote in your book that you, at first the family, 1t seemed, had hoped that the\nGermans would occupy rather than the Italians because you thought they would be better.",
        "Q: That\u2019s another unfortunate kind of thinking in Greece, but remember that in Greece at least 30\nto 40 percent of population were pro-German. That\u2019s a significant number. And because the --\nthe Greeks defeated the Italians in Albania, we were afraid that the Italians might come there and\nbe vindictive, while the -- the Germans actually did not find significant resistance because many\nGreek generals were pro-German.",
        "Q: So you were surprised?",
        "A: We were surprised that the Italians behaved in such a nice way. I have to say that the\nGermans behaved very well too, when they entered our area.",
        "Q: And they entered your area in April of nin -- \u201943?",
        "A: Yes. Sometime at the end of April, 40 -- \u00b041. Only in Salonica they did not behave well, but\nin our area they passed through and they did not bother anybody.",
        "Q: But your -- your area was the Italian zone?",
        "A: I happened to be -- because my father was mobilized, we were in -- in Ioannina when the\nGermans came in first. And they behaved very well, they did not bother anybody, although the\nJewish community of 2,000 approximately, people existed there, and they -- they ju -- simply\npassed. And then the Italians came, and they behaved very well.",
        "Q: So you moved back from Agrinion to --",
        "A: Yes, from -- from Ioannina, once my father became a civilian again, we moved to Agrini, and\nmy father went back to his bank. In other words, the Germans passed through Ioannina --",
        "Q: In \u00b041?",
        "A: In \u201941, and since this was the Italian zone of occupation, they did not stay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Italians were in charge until September of 1943.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then, once Italy capitulated, the Germans came in. When they came in Agrinio and they --\nthey loved the fact that the Italians were so afraid of the resistance and they had their buildings\nfortified, and with all kinds of guns around them, and they wanted to give a good lesson to the\nresistance. So 120 elite German troops went on 12 trucks and they moved straight towards the\nheadquarters of the partisans in the city of Thermi. What they did not know was that this lady I\nmentioned before with the cookies, Maria Demardi, who was fluent in German, had become the\ninterpreter for the German commander of Agrini. The partisans were waiting. Out of 120\nGermans, one wounded motorcyclist returned to Agrinion, and he -- even he died in -- within\ntwo days. And the Germans tried to keep it secret, and they did not even retaliate or shoot any\nhostages. Well, they learned their lesson and that meant that in the future they would not dare to\ngo to the mountains unless they had a very strong force, which served us very well later on.",
        "Q: So, how did your life change once the Italians capitulated?",
        "A: Well, from one point of view, you didn't -- it did not change much. There were little things,\nlike for example, the -- we had the neighbor, the director of the bank of agriculture, whose in --\nin -- the Germans wanted to -- to buy one of -- one room in his house. His mother wanted\nsomebody to go there while the Germans were in the house. She selected me. So here I am, a 15\nyear old Jewish boy, going there, you know, to protect the old mother. I find a very handsome,\nyoung German, very polite, and I thought we became friends because since he did not know\nGreek, and I did not know German, we played with the word good. And we figured out we knew\nit in Latin, ancient Greek, German, Fr-French, Italian, Spanish. I -- I knew it in Hebrew too, but I\nkept my mouth shut. And then all of a sudden I said, English, good. And the German became\nfurious and he slapped me. The mistake that I made was that I was thinking in terms of the word\ngood, and he was thinking in terms of people good. And obviously he didn't like the English\npeople. So I -- I understood that something was wrong. Another thing that happened was I was\nsitting in the balcony of my -- our apartment, and I saw a German chasing a young man who\nobviously was a -- a man of the resistance and he was shooting at him. The German entered the\ncourtyard of the house following the resistance man. The -- the man of the resistance passed\nthrough the first floor apartments and jumped out of the window right under my balcony. The\nGerman entered the courtyard and he saw the stairs leading to our house, and the door was open.\nHe ran through there, passed through a corridor, came right next to me in the balcony. He aimed\nat the resistance man down below, and he pressed the trigger. The gun jumped. The German\nlooked at me to see whether I was happy, but I was petrified. So he looked at this guy in disgust,\nand he left. Another thing that -- that happened was the Germans would send German soldiers to\nsearch the houses for weapons. And I remember a very polite, middle aged German knocked at\nthe door, my mother opened the door. He indicated he wanted to search, he opened one drawer,\nand my mother pretended that he was an honored guest and she treated him the way the -- a -- a\nguest is supposed to be treated in Greece by offering him some sweets, you know, in a little plate\nwith a spoon and a glass of water. The German felt embarrassed. He did not search anything else.\nHe bowed politely and he left. Another little --",
        "Q: Were you -- were you there --",
        "A: I was there, yes.",
        "Q: -- at the time? Were you frightened?",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t -- I mean, with the exception of the slap, that wasn\u2019t a very strong, I -- I didn't\nhave any bad experience. The next thing that happened was we bought a horse load of wheat.\nAnd the villager who brought the horse with the wheat told my father, in this bag there is a gun\nand ammunition for your friend Christos Bokoros, who was one of the leaders of the resistance.\nWell, my father wanted to get rid of the gun as soon as possible. So within a few minutes I had a\nbasket with the gun, the ammunition and some other unimportant items, and I was supposed to\ngo to the house of Bokoros. My father thought I was going to go through the back streets. Not\nme. I went through the -- through the main street, through the main square of Agrinion. I even\ntouched a German as I was passing. And I realized that what I was doing was dangerous only\nwhen I gave the gun to the sister of Bokoros, and I saw how -- how frightened she was. So\nbasically that\u2019s how our life was until one day -- Yunas Munis that I mentioned before, the\nteacher, went to my father and told him, you know something, the -- one of the merchants, I\nthink it was either Misann or Munis, went on business to Athens to buy merchandise. And he\nfound out that all the Jewish shops were closed, and he was told that the Jews went into hiding.\nSo he came back to us, and he told everybody, and we are all going to leave, and I\u2019m leaving\ntomorrow morning. So we -- although we didn\u2019t know why the Jews went into hiding, we were\nnot going to -- to wait. And we got ready to go, but we didn\u2019t know where to go. So we asked\none neighbor who was a right wing man. He told us to go to Arta, and from Arta to go to the area\nof -- of Zerbes, General Zerbes who was the right wing partisans. The only problem is how --\nhow do you go from Agrinio to Arta, you know, it was a good idea, but it\u2019s not possible to --\nthere was no real transportation and up til that time, we were using mainly Italian cars for the\nmovement to different cities. So we asked our other friend, Christos Bokoros, who was with the\nleft wing resistance, and he said, well, come to our house, and I will provide transportation. In o -\n- in other words, in -- in Greece, even a f -- a f -- man like my father, who was an assimilated\nJew with -- all his friends were Christians, you know, because they would not -- he didn\u2019t have\nthat much in common with the little merchants who were there. We were friendly, but all his\nfriends were Christians. Still, we did not know what to do, we needed help. So we went to the\nhouse of Bokoros, and he was going to provide transportation with horses, but all the horses\ndisappeared because a battle was taking place, and both sides used all available forces. And my\nfather, who was a good bank employee, he wanted to give his books in good order to the director\nof the bank, and transfer also the money. And he was wasting time. A -- a German soldier\nentered the house of Bokoros to just look around. The Bokoros family became scared. So one of\nthe Bokoros boys went to the bank and he told the director, and saw Mr. Matsas working there, if\nanything happens to him, I will consider you responsible. The director, knowing that the Bokoros\nfamily was with resistance told him I -- I don\u2019t keep him here, I will sign everything away. Sure\nenough, he signed the money -- for the money and everything without even counting it, and my\nfather went to wait with [indecipherable] in the house. Well there, since h-he couldn\u2019t find any\nhorses, he go, how about a tax1? Sure enough, he brought the taxi there, we loaded all our food\nsupplies, clothing and everything else, and put it -- some more people in the taxi, and we left in\nstyle. Within minutes we were at the control point, a German soldier checked the identity cards\nof the people. The driver gave to the German some cookies and raisins, and that was the last\nGerman I saw. Nobody had violated any rules or regulations, and nothing was punishable, there\nwas no crime involved. We simply went out, and that was it. Within minutes we saw the first\npartisan of ELAS. And I have to say I took a look at his hat, and I saw the word ELAS and I\nthought I discovered a spelling mistake. Ellas, which means Greece, is written with two |\u2019s, and\nhe had ELAS with one | because this was the ethnic [indecipherable] status, meaning Greek\nliberation army.",
        "Q: And what was the politics of that -- of that liberation army?",
        "A: We knew nothing.",
        "Q: You knew nothing.",
        "A: We knew nothing. All we knew that these people were fighting the Germans and only\nactually after the war we found out that many of the leaders were communists. But they were\nfighting the Germans, the -- they did not know any more than we did, and all I know 1s that they\nhad beautiful songs which I loved and I still sing.",
        "Q: Would you sing one of those for us?",
        "A: Oh boy. Yes, why not? You mean now?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: All right. I will give you the translation first. One of them starts like that, that there\u2019s thunder\nin the mount of Olympus, and there is lightening in the mouth -- th-the mount of Jonah. The\nmountain [indecipherable] are roaring and [indecipherable] is shaking. And then it extols him,\nasks all the people to take up arms and fight for freedom. So, [sings in Greek here]. That\u2019s one of\nthem.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very nice.",
        "A: So, with a taxi we went to the end of the road, s-some 30 miles away from Agrinio. And then\nwe rented horses, because we wanted to be as far away from roads as possible. And we pass\nthrough really unmarked paths, there were no wheels in that village of Psilovrahos. The people\nthere, unless they went to a city, they never saw a wheel, because it was very difficult terrain on\nthe slopes of a mountain. But very beautiful, overlooking a river, which now became a -- a lake,\nthanks to a dam that they made. We went there as students. We knew that nobody would bother\nus because the village was very well organized in terms of the resistance. Th-There -- there was -\n- there was active ELAS, which were the partisans, and there was reserve ELAS. So there were\norganizations for the men, for the women, everything was organized. So -- so it was a nice place\nto be. We brought with us a lot of supplies to last us for a year. The problem was that in\nNovember, the Germans decided to go on a search and destroy mission, and the -- we were\nnotified ahead of time -- the villagers were not afraid that anything would happen to them, but\nwe -- and in the meantime I should say some more Jews came to -- to the village, knowing that\nwe were there. There were two men, and another three people, a couple and a old man who did\nnot even know Greek, he was a ship tycoon, Aaron Romano, who was speaking in French rather\nthan Greek. And so we were --",
        "Q: Can I -- can I interrupt for one moment?",
        "A: Certainly.",
        "Q: When you got to the village, how did you get a place to stay?",
        "A: We rented. We rented a room. This -- we had with us plenty of money. My father\nunfortunately had only cash. He did not have any gold, that was a big mistake, because thanks to\ninflation, the money lost all it\u2019s value within months. So we rented a place, we acted like tourists.\nWe didn\u2019t hide the fact that we were Jews. As a matter of fact we were going to the church every\nSunday because we didn\u2019t want the -- the people to think that we were different, with the\nexception of the fact that we would not make the sign of the cross, or eat the wafers, or the pieces\nof bread that y-you know, a -- a Christian is supposed to -- to have at the end of the service. So\nwith the exception of that, we were very friendly with the priest, who used to come to my\nmother\u2019s place because we were the only ones who had coffee, and he liked to have coffee. And\nthe life was beautiful, and the -- it was li-like a vacation, until the Germans came. When they\ncame, we -- by now we were f-four of us, and two, six, we were nine -- four, seven -- we became\n10 Jews in the village. And we decided, and the people of the resistance told us that we should\ngo higher up, and they told us that there is a house very high up in the mountain of 300 feet, and\nyou should go there and stay there. So there were only two little donkeys that could be used for --\nfor supplies. So we loaded a little donkey, but un-unfortunately we had to leave all our supplies\nin the room. And we went to the -- to the top of the -- of the mountain, to the house of\n[indecipherable] and we stayed there, and the Germans stayed in the village for -- I -- I should\nadd that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy, a socialite from Athens decided she had enough, she wasn\u2019t\ngoing to go any -- any further, and she stayed in the village. And she spoke fluently German and\nFrench. And she spoke with the German officers very, very well, and -- and n-none of them\nasked her how come a lady like her ends up in a village like that. And -- and it didn\u2019t take long\nand the Germans left, and we came back. When we came back, we found out that we lost all our\nsupplies. Now, the owner of the house, who has a reputation as a thief claimed that it was the\nGermans who took it, who took everything. My mother went right into their house and searched\nand she found some of our items. The -- later on we found out when the villagers made the report\nas to how -- what things they lost, 1t was mainly bottles of Ouzo, bottles of wine, and they would\nsay, with the entire bottle. Because for them the bottle was more precious than the contents of\nOuzo and wine, which they could make by themselves. Therefore, I\u2019m convinced that it was this\nman, [indecipherable] who was the thief, and not the Germans. But we knew that the partisans, in\norder to establish some sort of tranquility and -- and e-eliminate [indecipherable] and fear, they\nhave killed even a partisan who stole a -- a chicken. And therefore, we decided to keep quiet, not\nto report him [indecipherable] the family. We wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for an execution.\nAnd we thought, well, we have more supplies in Agrinion and we will bring them. Unfortunately\nwe were not able to bring as many supplies as we needed, so we had some starvation later on.\nNow, the fact that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy decided to stay and the Germans were very polite,\nturned against us the following month, because the Germans made three attempts at research -- at\nsearch and destroy operations. In November, in December, and in the following August. So, in\nDecember there was another alarm that the Germans were approaching. This time, Mrs.\n[indecipherable] Levy persuaded my mother that the Germans are not dangerous they behaved so\nwell. My mother didn\u2019t like the idea of going up to the mountain, but also, she didn\u2019t want to\nabandon our supplies for fear that -- that they will be stolen again, although we had to change\nrooms because this man not only he resented the fact that we called him a thief, especially after\nwe found things hidden in his house, but he asked us to leave because we insulted him. He didn\u2019t\nrealize that we saved his life. And we moved to another room that we also rented. So my mother\ndecided to -- to help Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy in her room, since the knew German so well,\nand -- and stay there. But a neighbor who saw that, told the lady -- she was a -- a\n[indecipherable] a former policeman and his son was a partisan and he told them, what makes\nyou believe that there will be the same Germans, or they will became -- they will be just as polite\nas they were before, or they might not have orders to ar-arrest you as suspicious individuals. So\nshe forced them to come up to the mountain lake with it, but fortunately the Germans did not\ncome this second time in the village. Are you curious about what happened the third time, in\nAugust?",
        "Q: Well, did anything happen in between?",
        "A: In --",
        "Q: Between February and August?",
        "A: -- in between, with the exception that we faced starvation because the -- the war between the\nGermans and the partisans intensified, and while before it was so easy to get in and out of\nAgrinion, it became more difficult. So the end result was that -- that it was not easy to send a\nvillager in the bank where my father had stored his supplies and get from a -- one his friends\nthere, who was -- he was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to understand that, but the bank was trying to help the\nemployees even with food supplies. So one of the rooms in the bank had food, and an employee\nwould take care of food distribution to the employees of the bank. So this man also had our\nsupplies with instructions when my father would send a man to get whatever we wanted, but this\nsource was -- was lost. So we -- we really suffered from -- from starvation. I mean, but this is not\n-- this is the least that can happen to you.",
        "Q: But what kinds of things were you able then to eat? This was true of a lot of people in Greece\nat this time, right, that this was very bad --",
        "A: Well, not -- not -- not -- it was -- it was bad only in Athens, not in the provinces.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The provi -- provinces had plenty of food, and people from Athens would come to the\nprovinces to get food. In -- in Agrinion, as long as we were not [indecipherable] there was no\nproblem, it was like peacetime. I mean, you had as much food as you wanted. Only when we lost\nour supplies and we were not able to get the quantities that we needed, only then -- we had\nbasically to eat a lot of wild vegetables. I had -- that was my job. I had to go, with a knife, and\nget anything that was green on the ground, all over the place, that the animals would not eat\nbecause they were -- these things were bitter. And then my mother would boil these things and\nmix them with a little corn flour and she would put just enough oil on the -- on the big, big pot,\nand cook them. I found out eventually that this cellulose can be absorbed by the body. So\nbasically, that\u2019s what kept us alive, because we could eat enormous quantities of these because I\nwould get, you know, bi-big quantities and we would eat that. Basically, that\u2019s what th -- that\u2019s\nwhat it was. The one thing I can say 1s that at -- what helped us at one point was the fact that a\npartisan unit came to stay in the village. And we told them that we were starving. And they\noffered to de -- I mean, they -- at -- at night, when they had their meetings, all the partisans voted\nin favor of giving us a -- a portion. And also to the family of [indecipherable] Levy. And -- and\nwhen the -- the trumpet would -- would sound, I would go in line and get a portion -- the\npartisans were not fed very well either, mainly th-they had a corn soup. That\u2019s -- that was -- and\na few olives. But we would divide that portion that was for one man, we would divide it into\nfour. And in this way, w -- for the duration of their s -- their stay in Psilovrahos which was\nmaybe 20 - 25 days, we did not touch our supplies. That proved to be very, very important\nbecause ultimately we did not have anything. And on that day, one of the men of the village --\nactually he was the leader of the reserve ELAS, he -- he told me to -- to go and collect berries,\nand by that time there were berries, as many as you wanted. And I did. We ate berries for four\ndays and we all became sick. At that point we didn\u2019t know what to do because the\n[indecipherable] production was going to come within days, but not in our village, which was on\nthe mountain. So my mother and I took the last supply that we had, which was sugar, and we\nwent down, we crossed the river of [indecipherable] and we went to a [indecipherable] village of\na [indecipherable]. And there we exchanged sugar, which nobody had, for [indecipherable],\nwhich was some cereal that had milk. And that was the turning point in -- in our food situation.\nOnce the time came that the villages had produced -- had -- had a lot of things, 1-1-1n the\nmeantime we -- we realized what we had to do, but that\u2019s a little -- it\u2019s a little -- another story,\nbecause we had -- well, where to find parachute material, but this happened accidentally. When e\n-- in April, or at the beg -- at the end of March, my mother decided that she sh -- would go to\nAgrinion and get supplies. And my father and myself -- I-I was at that time 13 going on 14, my\nsister was only five to six, so my father an-and myself told her not to go, but she was very str --\nopinionated and she decided to go. And she walked for practically 12 hours to go to Agrinion.\nAnd at one point she had to cross a -- a -- a bridge, and one of the guards there was a partisan -- a\nJewish partisan [indecipherable] from Arta, that my mother knew him. And he told her, don\u2019t\nyou know that the -- the -- the Jews have been arrested, and they are in Agrinion in warehouse of\nPapapetrou? Of course my mother did not know anything, but she -- I have to say that before that\nmy mother was stopped by a -- a teacher of mine who recognized her, and he told her, where are\nyou going? Don\u2019t you know that the Jews have been arrested, and in addition, don\u2019t you know\nthat the Germans executed some 200 Christian hostages because of the war that takes place\nbetween the Germans and the partisans. And my mother said that -- of course she felt very bad,\nand sick about -- hearing about the Jews, but she was determined, and she said, I have to go, I\nhave to get food. So the -- the teacher said, why don\u2019t you go until the village that is very close\nto -- to Agrinion, and -- and stop there at the mailbox, and th-this is a house of a godfather of\nmine, and he 1s a teacher in the village. You tell them that I sent you, and send him to Agrinion\nto get the food. So my mother explained to the partisan [indecipherable] that this is my plan, and\nI\u2019m not going to go beyond this little village, which was in the outskirts of Agrinion, and he let\nher go, and that\u2019s what happened. She met the teacher. The teacher went with his horse to the\nbank. He happened to be a godf -- he was a godfather of the director of the bank -- this is a\ntremendous coincidence considering that [indecipherable] is the director of the bank, was\nsupposed to be a descendant of the families which were converted in 1821. Svordis was a\ncommon Jewish name in Ioannina. Svordis could have been also one of the -- the convert\nfamilies. And my father claims that even the intermediary between the two of them, Zambaris,\nthat was the nickname of the Levy family of Ioannina. So, it -- it\u2019s a -- an amazing coincidence\nto have all these three people being godfathers to each other, and been involved in helping my\nmother at this point. Now, when he went to the bank with the horse in front of it, the director\nbecame terrified. I mean th-th-th -- under these conditions, getting food on a horse that is going\nto go outside of the city, the whole bank can be considered guilty of doing something wrong, as\nfar as the Germans and their collaborators, and there were plenty by that time. There were the\nsecurity -- Greek security battalions active at that time. So the only thing we were able to get\nthanks to that expedition was some quinine and some sugar and some tea that could be placed in\nthe pocket of -- and when the man came back, he was not satisfied to leave my mother there, it\nwas a-approaching nighttime when neither the partisans would allow anybody to move, nor the\nGermans. So he proposed to my mother that they should go to sleep in a small church that his\ngrandfather had built of prophet Elia. Even that to me is significant. And [indecipherable] went\nand zamp -- Zambaris -- that\u2019s name, Zambaris and my mother spent the night in that little\nchurch on top of the mountain where it was cold, and the wind was blowing. Then the following\nday, my mother came back to the village. When she told us what was -- what happened, o-of\ncourse she was exhausted, you know, a-after 24 hours and -- and the trauma of knowing, a-and --\nbecause they made a mistake and they told her that the Jews of Ioannina were also there, which\nmeans that all our relatives were there. So she was really a wreck. But in spite of that, she wanted\nto go on another expedition in which the British mission which was in Priansa. That time we\nwere assured that as soon as the allies would know that the Jews were arrested, they would\nimmediately mobilize all their know-how and all their means at their disposal and the Jews\nwould be s-set free. So again my mother -- you see, my -- my father had some problems, he had\nsome pain with his legs, and he couldn\u2019t walk at that time. So my mother again, and myself, we\nembarked on an expedition of approximately a total of 14 hours of hiking in unknown territory,\ncrossing and re-crossing two rivers. That means four times crossing rivers to go there. And we\nwent to the village of Priansa where we had a meeting with a British major who -- his friend, a --\na prostitute who was there told us -- well, I-I should say this, passing on the way there, we had to\nstop in a -- 1-1n a controlled partisan point, which was manned by our banker from Agrini. And\nhe told us [indecipherable] we -- we told him what was our mission, what we wanted to do. And\nhe told us to go to this lady. There were other prostitutes there who were so-called working for\nthe British mission. And he told us that this particular girl was the girlfriend of the British major,\nbut evidently, she was also in contact with the resistance. And he told my mother to go to her and\nshe will be able to talk to the -- to the major so the major will -- would be a little bit better to us.\nBut when we went there and we found her, the first thing that she did when she saw how I was\ndressed, because I was -- I was wearing my short fascist uniform, a blue uniform that it was\nstrong material, but because my legs were exposed, my mother had s -- had sewn or attached to\nthem some woolen leggings. So I was dressed like that. Soon as she saw that, she gave me the\nleftover [indecipherable] khaki pair of wi -- winter khaki pants that she had cut them to make\nshorts out of them, and she gave us the leftover, you know, so my mother can make some -- a\nbetter pair of pants for me. And she said that she had an argument with the major and he was not\nin a good mood. But nevertheless, the -- the m-major saw us, and he was very nice, and he knew\nFrench so my mother spoke to him in French. And he promised to send a message to -- to the\nheadquarters, and a -- a message to my father\u2019s sister who lived at that time in Alexandria,\nEgypt. But we know that the message in Alexandria, Egypt never went. But we were in that\nvillage, we realized that the village was filled with parachute material because the planes were\ncoming at night and they were dropping weapons and ammunition for the resistance. And there\nwas plen-plenty of parachute material. So my mother went from house to house and she begged\nthese villagers, who didn\u2019t know what to do with this material, and we collected a lot of material,\nand cord, and everything else. And when we came back, my mother, who had an elementary\nknowledge of sewing, she went into the business of -- of -- shall I stop? Yes. She went into the\nbusiness of making shirts, and we used some material th-that we brought for mattresses, to make\npants out of them. And eventually she changed these materials by going to different villages --\nvillages for years, you know, did not have any material. And we collected enough wheat and\ncorn and everything else to last us for the next two or three years. And but this -- this is the story\nthat is related to food. I -- I bet --",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we -- why don\u2019t we stop now, since we\u2019re close to the end of this tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And we\u2019ll continue on the next one.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Mike, why were the Jews of Athens going into hiding at that time?",
        "A: We found out about it much later. Who -- what happened was this. The Germans asked the\nchief rabbi of Athens, Elia Barzelai to give them a list of the Jews of Athens. The rabbi of course\nhad -- was given sa -- some time to prepare the list and during that time the Jews of Athens, or\nimportant Jews of Athens found out or they knew about it. And one of them was a -- a Greek\nJewish journalist, Baruch Schibi, who was one of the leaders of resistance in Athens. He was a\nman from Salonica who never intended to be in a place where the Germans were, and when the\nGermans were entering Greece, he attempted to leave and go to Egypt, and he reached only Crete\nand then you know when the Germans attacked Crete with the parachutists, h -- and he was not\nable to go to Egypt and he returned back to Athens. He knew what happened to Salonica. What\nhappened in Salonica was that the leadership with Rabbi Koretz proved to be very ineffective.\nAnd since the Jews did not know that the Germans were killing Jews outside of Greece, they did\nnot have the incentive that a hunted animal has. And you know, when somebody is hunted, the\ninstinct of survival of course, is you -- to either flee, hide or fight. The -- the situation was such\nthat although the German intentions towards the Jews of Salonica proved to be bad from the\nbeginning, only the wealthy Jews, some 3,400 of them took advantage of the fact that up til\nFebruary 1942, they were able to freely and legally move from the Bulgarian and German zones\nof occupation and go to the Italian zone, where the Italians were living very well as I told you\nbefore. The remaining Jews in Bulgaria and Macedonia, and that\u2019s where the great majority of\nthe Jews were, they did not know what to do. I feel they were like children who needed help, and\nnobody was ready to help them. So in Salonica the organization ELAS proposed to the\ncommunity to help, but the leaders of the community refused this help. The communist party\nproposed to help, and they suggested that the Jewish children should go to trusted families of the\nparty, and the rest of the population to be dispersed outside of Salonica as long as it was free and\nlegal to do -- to do so. But this proposal was rejected by the leaders also. So basically, you have\nsome over 50,000 Jews there not having any leaders, not knowing what was going on, and\nfurthermore, not having Christian friends, most of them, as a result of anti-Semitism. The\npopulation in Macedonia and Salonica was either indifferent or hostile to the Jews, and the proof\nis that out of over 10,000 Jewish families in Salonica, only one family, that of Haim Pardo, of\nfive people was offered a shelter in the house of Dr. George and Fedra Carracortso right in the\ncenter of Salonica where they stayed indoors for 18 months. There was some other 70 Jews who\nwere saved in Salonica, but these were mainly husbands, or fianc\u00e9s of Christians. The -- the\nuniversity, or the other organizations of Salonica did not protest, did not do anything, but some\nlawyers protested to the general governor -- the general governor Simonides, he said, we are\nremoving the thorns from your garden, and you are protesting? The -- the one who pleaded with\nthe Germans was the bishop of Salonica, Yanadios, who asked them to use magnanimity and\nclemency, especially when the time for the deportations came, and he -- he is considered as a\nrighteous Gentile. Another protest for which Greece should be really proud was made by the\narchbishop of Greece, Damaskinos, and it was signed by 42 members -- leaders of Greek\norganizations. And in this case, what really happened was that the -- these people would meet\nperiodically to discuss the problems of the occupation, and one day a Jewish woman from\nSalonica told him what was happening, and the poet [indecipherable] Yanosh wrote the appeal, it\nwas signed immediately by all 42, and it was delivered to the Germans, and to the government of\nGreece. The prime minister of Greece, Logothetopoulos, instead of trying to protect the Jews of\nSalonica when they were deported, he confessed that he was in favor of the deportations because\nthere would be a lot of vacant housing that was needed. So, 252 Jewish students from the\nUniversity of Salonica became partisans of ELAS, over 600 Jews became partisans of ELAS.\nWhen the proposals of the communist party were rejected, the communists th -- remember that\nthey had 150 members in their lists who were Jews. So they appealed to them to go to the\nmountains. Out of them, 75 decided to go, but as they were divided into three groups and they\nwere going for the mountains, they thought, and what about our families? How are we going to\nlet our families be by themselves in exile? And they came back and they surrendered to the\nGermans. Now, Baruch Schibi knew all that, and he was afraid that the same thing was going to\nbe repeated in Athens. So he conceived the plan of abducting or killing Rabbi Barzelai of\nAthens. The other leaders of the resistance agreed with his plan, and they went to the rabbi and\nthey told him. Rabbi was ready, he said I\u2019m -- do anything you want with me. And they took him\nand his family and they moved them to the mountains. When the word went around, the Jews of\nAthens disappeared. However, there were poor Jews who at the beginning they thought they\nwould hide too, but they needed to work. And they started going into the -- into the -- th -- to the\nGermans, and the Germans kindly extended their deadline and allowed all of the Jews who\nwould come slowly [indecipherable] they would come and the -- the Germans wouldn\u2019t do\nanything to them more, they would come -- this was noticed by none other than an American\nconsul general who was operating from Istanbul. And in the state department where there are 500\npages of documents sent from Consul Berry, Brigadier General Tindall, and Ambassador\nMakvay of [indecipherable] 500 pages. In one of them this situation is noticed by a b -- a --\nBurton Berry, who s -- who tells the state department that -- that we need a little financial\nassistance here because the poor Jews are reporting and now they tell them that they should\nreport within a 15 minute interval, which means that the Germans want to arrest them within that\n15 minute interval. All these reports were ignored, and filed in the archives, where I found them\nin 1975. Eventually 1,000 Jews of Athens were registered. But things became nice again.\nEverything was normal up til March of -- 25\"\" of March 1944. That was the time that the Jews of\nIoannina [indecipherable] that my mother was supposed to -- t-to find in Agrinion if she went\nthere, were all arrested. And the -- a-and -- and Burton Berry in another document says, didn\u2019t I\ntell you that this was going to happen? And -- and he gave other warnings. Actually, the most\nimportant warning that he gave was the following. There was a -- a -- a Greek Christian\nmerchant, Michael [indecipherable] who, a-as I said before, business was as normal as it could\nbe in Greece. He went on business, he was a tobacco merchant, and he was going on business to\nIstanbul. In his train compartment -- evidently he was traveling first class, he started a\nconversation with three German SS officers, who told him point blank that we are going to stop\nhere in Larisa because we are on our way to Corfu, where we will deport all the Jews of Corfu.\nIn other words, the Germans were so sure that nobody cared, especially a Christian merchant,\nthat they told him a military secret. Now, this man was a good man. As soon as he went to\nIstanbul, he went straight to the American consul -- consulate, and he told Burton Berry what\nwas happening. Burton Berry immediately notified the state department, and again nothing\nhappened, although it was so easy to make a radio contact with the British military missions.\nBritish military missions had contact with the resistance, which existed in all the cities, not to\nmention secret American and British agents which operated in Greece. All of these people could\nhave notified the Jews and tell them what was happening. It took -- fr -- from these reports, it\ntook until June ninth, the Jews of Corfu were arrested. In the German archives, even the German\ncommander of Corfu send a report to his superiors, a lengthy report in which he was trying to tell\nthem that there is no need to do anything towards the Jews, they have never bothered us.\nEvidently he -- he said, we don\u2019t have any means of transportation, why don\u2019t you arrest the --\nthe Italian soldiers of Bertolio who are -- are dangerous? Th-The Jews never bothered us. Out of\n2,000 Jews, only 187 returned from the camps. So this 1s the -- the -- the story with the -- the\nstate depart -- and the American -- American government. Now, Baruch Schibi continued his\nactivities as a -- a leader of the resistance, and he was responsible for the mili-military\nintelligence during certain battles in the [indecipherable] where hundreds of Germans are\nworking.",
        "Q: A few minutes ago you mentioned your sister for the first time. How old was your sister?",
        "A: She was born in 1938, so at that time she was no more than five going on six.",
        "Q: Was this a hard time for her, because she was really such a -- she was, what, four years old in\nf -- 1943 -- five years old?",
        "A: Yes, well, life in the villages I told you was a beautiful life, and the life we had in the city was\na beautiful life, with the exception of the -- of few months that we had this starvation. But we\nwere not really hungry, thanks to these vegetables that we were --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- eating. Only in retrospect we realized how bad the situation was. Basically, with only the f -\n- the four days of eating berries were difficult.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name?",
        "A: Minetta, and she\u2019s at --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Minetta Feldman, she\u2019s married, and she\u2019s living in Bethesda and she\u2019s a teacher.",
        "Q: And your mother -- it seems as if prior to this period of time you -- you have a -- a rather\nprivileged life, and your mother 1s not necessarily doing the necessities in the home. But when\nyou go to the village, she has to transform herself. Was this difficult for her?",
        "A: Well, actually, in Greece, even if you had the maid, or even had a cleaning woman, still you --\nyou have to do -- to do things that were -- you didn\u2019t have the facilities that you have now, so she\nwas working very hard in the house like everyone else. She was not a -- a lady of leisure.",
        "Q: You -- you say in your -- in your book that she was teaching the village women embroidery\nand sewing, 1s that --",
        "A: Yes, sh-she -- she did that. She had a lot of friendships with the -- with the women. And\ntalking about my sister, she -- I don\u2019t think she understood that the situation was bad. She\nenrolled in the village school. I made a book for her, you know, by copying another book. I used\na little basin as a boat in one of the ponds there. She -- she never complained.",
        "Q: Were you going to school there in the village as well, or not?",
        "A: No, no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- there was only an elementary school of four years, you know. I -- and I -- actually I took all\nthe schoolbooks with me and I confess -- confess that I did not open them even once, although I\nconsider that year as the -- the most formative and important year of my life. And -- and actually\nwhen we came back from the village -- we left on October third, 1943, I came back on October\nthird or fourth of 1944. I wrote down all the memories of that year and I entitled it, \u201cOne Year in\nthe Mountains,\u201d and I gave it to my teacher of literature to see it. He kept it for six months in his\ndrawer, and he gave it back to me without making any comment. I gave it to my father. He\nlooked at it, and he made a hiding place under the -- the heavy dining room table. Why? Because\nI loved the partisans, and I loved their songs. And immediately after the war, what happened in\nGreece is this, Greece 1s the only country in Europe where those who fought the Germans lost\ntheir jobs, they -- after the war, they lost their jobs, they were imprisoned, they were exiled, or\nthey were executed. Not all of them of course, you know, but -- but -- but most of them. Maybe I\nshouldn\u2019t say most of them, but -- but a great number of -- of the resistance fighters suffered this\n-- this fate. As a matter of fact, there -- there were even some Jewish partisans who were\nexecuted, and one of them, the most important Jewish -- Greek Jewish partisans, who was an\nexpert in agriculture, Lazarus Azarias, he was a brilliant man and a highly organized person, and\nhe was in charge of supplies for the resistance. And he was so effective 1n hi -- in this job, that\nimmediately after the war the Greek government condemned him to death in abstentia because\nhe managed to escape and go to Israel, where he became eventually, the director of Nuva, which\nis one conglomerate dealing with produce.",
        "Q: And why did this happen? What -- why was this response to the partisans? Was it only ELAS\nthat they were responding to?",
        "A: Yes, not ELAS, ELAS was the right wing partisans, they didn\u2019t bother them. And\n[indecipherable] my father\u2019s first cousin was a -- a doctor who was an officer in -- in ELAS, a\nmedical officer. What happened was that e -- that Churchill and Stalin divided parts of Europe in\nzones of influence. And the -- that Greece was part of the British zone of influence. So when the\nwar ended, the -- the British w-were afraid that the -- the army of -- a -- of ELAS, which had\ncommunist leaders, they were afraid that they might take over, so what they -- what they did is\nthey -- they landed troops in Greece but th-they needed allies who would be their natural allies.\nBut the former German corroborators who were in the security battalions, and the provincial\npolice which also collaborated with the Germans, and I don\u2019t know about the police in -- in -- in\nAthens because the leaders of the police were [indecipherable] and Evert are considered\nrighteous Gentiles because they issued false identity cards for many Jews. But the fact is that all\nthese groups were, including the -- especially including the German collaborators, they were the\nforce that took over in Greece, and -- and therefore, anyone who had to do -- anything to do with\nthe resistance became a -- a communist suspect, including me. What actually happened with me\nis that when I graduated from high school at the age of 17, I needed a -- a special police permit to\ngo to Athens to -- to take the entrance exams for the school, for the university. So I went to the\npolice to -- to take the -- the permit, and to my surprise, they refused it. So, I said I wanted to\nspeak to the chief of the police. I went to his office, and he was sitting there with the\n[indecipherable] who I knew he was a German collaborator, and the leader of the paramilitary\nfascist organization, X. I didn\u2019t like that, but I told the chief of the police, why don\u2019t I get the --\nthe permit? And he reminded me of the fact that I was in the mountains. I know I was in trouble\nalready and there was no need to ex -- no use to explain to them that I was a Jew, most probably\nthey knew that already. But by that time I had become streetwise, so to speak, and I remembered\nthat my high school principal had been arrested by the partisans as soon as they moved into\nAgrinion because he was -- he was an eloquent speaker, and he extolled and asked the Greek\nyouth to imitate the German youth in the fight against the evil forces of the allies. So the\npartisans put him in prison together with [indecipherable] and many, many others. And the\nBritish released them from prison. So, I also knew that I was one of his best students in his\nsubjects, Latin, ancient Greek and modern Greek. And so I told the chief of the police, I\nunderstand that you don\u2019t know anything about me. The only thing -- the only one who knows\nme 1s my high school principal, because I\u2019ve been a student up til now. Was, you know, 17. The\ntwo of them looked at each other and smiled, and the chief replied, if you bring us a paper from\nthe -- from Mr. [indecipherable] who they knew very well, you have no problem. So I went\nstraight to his house because he was sick in bed, and I told him what happened, and he became\nfurious. He immediately dictated a -- a letter to his son who was there, and he -- but this was a\nserious business. This was not, you know, just a letter, he asked him to go to the high school and\nask a specific professor to have this typed, and -- and have it stamped, and -- and return it to him\nfor his signature, and then take it to the police. And I remember that he was ending his letter of\nrecommendation by saying that I have nationalist feelings and Christian ethics, although this man\nknew perfectly well that I was a Jew. So this is my experience after the war as a -- as a man\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did your -- your father work for ELAS, the --",
        "A: My -- my father -- in the village as I show -- I told you, everything was very well organized, it\nwas -- it wa -- all the branches of the resistance were represented. My father, since he was a bank\nemployee, they asked him to be the -- in charge of ETA, which was the provisions for the\npartisans. Now, the village was extremely poor, and the provisions that my father collected were\ninsignificant, but still my father officially, he was the representative of ETA in the village. When\nwe came to Agrinion, the Germans had left enormous warehouses filled with supplies, which had\nnot been able to take with them when they were abandoning Greece. So the partisans occupied\nall these tremendous warehouses of [indecipherable]. I remember they were filled to capacity\nwith things. And they asked my father if he would like to be the director. My father was so\ngrateful to the partisans, he -- he did. So he was the director of the warehouses until the partisan\narmy was destroyed, which was maybe three -- three or four months later.",
        "Q: So go -- go back to your being in the mountains in that last push by the Germans in the\nsummer of \u00b044.",
        "A: In August.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In August of 1944, this time the -- some -- a s -- a column of -- a column of 600 German\ntroops, assisted by tanks and mountain artillery advanced again through this particular road that\nwe said [indecipherable] and then at that point, the partisans this time ordered the evacuation of\nall the villages in the area. So this third time that was the most serious out of the all three times, I\nwas feeling very happy, because this was the first time that it was not only we the Jews who had\nto leave the village and go to the top of the mountain, but everybody had to do it. So sure\nenough, the whole village was evacuated. We went to a plateau overlooking the river and the\nvillages below, and --",
        "Q: And how many -- how many people?",
        "A: In the village? Over 300. With their animals and everything we went to this plateau and at\nthat point the teacher of the village approached my father and he said, if a German patrol comes\nhere, they might arrest you and me and take us as hostages. So we better go and find -- I mean,\nactually he found a -- a good hiding place, away from the rest of the villagers. So we went with\nhim and we found ourselves in a sort of a balcony, which was covered with a -- the branches of a\ntree. A balcony with a magnificent view of the river below, and the villages of Apiscope and --\nand Psilovrahos. And I was able to see from a distance the column like -- like ants, it looked, the\nsoldiers moving. And then what happened was that the partisans attacked the Germans. And a\nferocious battle took place for almost an hour. And then, when the German artillery started\nfiring, then we knew the situation was really bad. But the partisans, when the artillery started\nfiring, they withdrew, and it became quiet again. And that was the time that the -- the little ants\nthat we saw before started -- starting at different houses and then smoke would be coming from\nthese houses. They were burning the house -- the houses of the village of Apiscope. We did not\nsee them, they did not have a chance to -- to burn our village, but we -- but they -- they left\nwithin a couple of days.",
        "Q: And then you returned back to --",
        "A: Then we came back to the village where we found all our supplies intact because there was --\nMr. [indecipherable] was not there to take care of us again.",
        "Q: And then what happened, was that the -- close to the end?",
        "A: Yeah, August, this was August sixth, and the Germans started withdrawing by the end of\nSeptember, and -- and at the beginning of October we were back where we were before.",
        "Q: In Agrinion.",
        "A: In Agrinion.",
        "Q: And what was that like, to return to Agrinion?",
        "A: I had a -- I remember that I was expecting that I was going to be very happy, you know, to\ncome into a free city. It -- it was a sort of a disappointment, I -- I was not as happy as I expected\nto be, especially knowing -- we didn\u2019t know what was happening to our relatives, and we were\nafraid that maybe my grandparents were too old to survive, you know, all this transportation, and\nthat, but we never expected to see what really happened.",
        "Q: And what did you see?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: What did you see?",
        "A: We -- we saw nothing, I mean, the city was the same way like it was before, and only when I\nwent to Ioannina and saw the -- there was none of the people that we were -- w-we used to -- to\nhave there, that were na -- there, only then I started wondering why all this happened. I had many\nquestions that I had in my -- my mind. Question number one would be why such a thing would\nhappen. And the -- my -- my answer was in one word, anti-Semitism. In two words would be\nreligious anti-Semitism. And I\u2019m very much -- very familiar with the -- the church teachings. I\nknow exactly what they say, especially during the -- the holy week. And if -- if you have in -- in\nthe church, young children who are exposed to the beautiful picture of Jesus Christ and then you\nlove this person, and then all of a sudden you find out that it was the Jews who -- who killed him,\nI mean, how would you feel? It\u2019s [indecipherable] like I faced that when I was in the village, and\non Good Friday we were in the church, and the -- and the priest did whatever he had to do. When\nhe came for a coffee to my parents. he apologized. And he said, I -- I\u2019m sorry I had to say so\nmany things -- because that\u2019s in Greek, we can understand, that\u2019s not in Latin. And, I\u2019m sorry I\nhad to say all these things, but you understand, that\u2019s my job. My parents, of course, they\nunderstood. And the following day I saw a little boy, maybe no more than five, who I used to be\nhis hero, and he used to follow me around all the time. And he looked at me with suspicion and\nsome sort of hate. So I told him, why, what -- what\u2019s wrong? And he said, \u201cYou killed Jesus\nChrist.\u201d And I will never forget that. That would be my question number one. The -- the second\nquestion would be when did the allies know about all this? I was under the impression that they\ndidn't know. That\u2019s the reason my mother and I were eating that vegetable pie. We -- we -- we\nwalked for 14 hours. What I found out is that the British had broken the older police code of the\nGermans as early as 1939. And this older police was the one that was in charge of the Jews.\nThere are documents which prove that they knew exactly when a German unit would say, arrest\n100 Jews in Paris, who was the leader of the group, how many men he had under his command,\nwhere did he stop on his way to -- to Auschwitz, or there were killing grounds even in -- in\nMinsk. And they -- they documented all that by simply following these radio transmissions. So\nall this -- all this was known. The -- the Americans, up til the time that Germany declared war\nagainst the United States, they had embassies and consulates all over the place. They had secret\nagents every -- everywhere. The documents -- I -- I checked only the 500 documents that were\nrelated to Greece, they knew exactly everything to the point that rather than interviewing\nsurvivors when I wanted to -- to find what was going on, I preferred to read the -- the reports of\nBurton Berry. He was a far more eloquent writer than any of these survivors. So they knew what\nwas going on. And then the third question is, why didn\u2019t they do anything? And again, the\nanswer comes in these words, religious anti-Semitism. Even in the United States, there was\ndiscrimination against the Jews in terms of employment, and the -- the real historians know now\nthat the state department not only blocked immigration, blocked information, they even tried to\ncover it up to the point that the -- that the -- that the secretary of the treasury sent a report saying\nacqul -- acquiescence of the United States to the murder of the Jews of [indecipherable]. That\u2019s\nserious stuff, ac-acquiescence. And then you have other people who, like Professor David\nWyman, who says that I, as a Christian, he says he -- he\u2019s appalled that the churches did not do\nanything and they remained silent in the United States. Let alone the Vatican, let alone all the --\nthe bishops of all Germany. So this is the -- the old story. But I have to say another thing, that\nlike I mentioned before, the Jewish contribution, the Greek je -- military Jewish contribution\nwith Colonel Frizis. And this was very important and Greece has to be very proud of that\nbecause the action of the Greek army delayed the German attack against Russia by six crucial\nweeks. The Germans were forced to fight a winter war in Russia, which was -- had disastrous\nconsequences for the Germans. So this I would say is the direct contribution of Greece, indirect\ncontribution of -- of Colonel Frizis since he was the first one who stopped the Italians and then\nadvanced as -- ahead of his troops, although he was killed later, but this was a great contribution.\nThen you have all the Jews who fought in the British forces, including I would say the son of the\nfirst president of Israel, Haim Weitzman, who was shot down over the British channel. And then\nthere were 550,000 American Jews who served in the armed forces of the United States. In other\nwords, when we asked, why didn\u2019t the allies help? I say, this is not a case of benevolence, or a\ncase of -- of charity, the Jews earned and deserved the right to be assisted. Not only that, let\u2019s not\nforget that if America became a nuclear power, which guaranteed American supremacy, it was\nbecause of Jewish men like Einstein, Oppenheimer, Ziller, Teller, Rabbe, while the relatives of\nthese Jewish men were dying in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. Personally, I\nbelieve that it was wrong, unfair, ungrateful and shameful for the United States and Great Britain\nto abandon the Jews and let them die the way they did.",
        "Q: What about the Greek population during this period of time?",
        "A: The Greek population in -- the great majority of the Jews were in Salonica, and -- in -- in\nnorthern -- northern mass -- massa -- in Macedonia and -- and [indecipherable] and northern\nGreece. The population there was far more anti-Semitic than the enlightened people of Athens.\nAnd as I said before, only one family out of 10,000 famil -- families was offered asylum. That\ntells, as far as I\u2019m concerned, plenty. Many believed that it was not easy to -- to go to the\nmountains in -- in -- in Macedonia, that the resistance was very weak in 1943. But there is a story\nthat I sent for publication to the journal of Hellenic Diaspora, and that\u2019s the story of a friend of\nmine, Dr. Joseph Struncis from Veria. And in this story you see how his father, who was the\npresident of the Jewish community of Veria, he didn\u2019t know what to do, like everybody else. He\ncontacted this -- this horrible Jewish leader, Rabbi Koretz, and he --",
        "Q: Could you just stop for one moment? What -- are we 0 -- are we okay? Yeah. [indecipherable]\nokay.",
        "A: He contacted Rabbi Koretz, and he tried to reassure him that everything would be alright, that\nthe Jews of Poland -- I mean, accept the deportation, the Jews of Poland has -- have houses for us\nand jobs and everything will be alright, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. But -- but he was not\nsatisfied, so he went to the chief of the police of Veria, Stavridis, and that\u2019s another righteous\nGentile that I would like to add into -- into my list of -- of the 12 or 13. And -- and he told him\nnot to listen to the rabbi, not to trust the Germans, just go to the mountains. Now, to see how\neasy it was to go to the mountains, my friend had a senile 85 year old grandmother, and they\nwere not going to leave her behind. So, they ended up w-with her on a horse and they had to\ncross a river with a raft. The raft was very small. She was on the horse, she could not see the raft.\nShe moved to the other side of the river, and for the rest of her life she was talking about how --\nabout the miracle that took place like in the time in Moses, that the waters parted, and she\npassed. And it would have been done, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s exactly the point that I want -- I -- I want to\nsay, but you had to have some Christian friends, because the Christians knew far better as to\nwhat -- what had to be done. In addition to that, it was the Christians and not the Jews who had\nfriends and trusted relatives in the remote mountains of Greece, where there were hundreds of\nvillages. Why they were in s-such inhospitable places, where they had to -- to cultivate things\nfrom terraces, because during 400 years of horrible Turkish occupation, that\u2019s where they had\ntheir freedom. And they would have sent -- who -- you see, when the leader of the communist\nparty was talking about sending them, dispensing them to -- to our side, he knew what he was\ntalking about. But the Jewish leaders wouldn\u2019t want to have anything to do with somebody like\nhim, and all -- all ri -- so were waiting to see what their -- what -- they were waiting for whom? I\nme -- believe there was Koretz who was collaborating with the Germans.",
        "Q: You would say that Koretz collaborated? You would use a strong word like that?",
        "A: I -- well, I would say this, he was not a bad man. His wife, Gitta Koretz send me a 48 page\nletter in which she was trying to -- to -- to justify his actions, that he was an intellectual who\nknew t -- 12 languages, who -- who had a Ph.D. in oriental studies, who could have left Salonica\nand go with the mayor of Athens, who invited him to leave and go to Egypt, and he didn't want\nto do that. It\u2019s possible that he thought that 1t was only a deportation, I -- I can\u2019t tell. But if I were\nthere, I -- and -- and I saw what the Germans were doing, especially when the Germans as-\nassembled in -- in July of 1943. They assembled 9,000 Jewish men age 15 to 45, and they\nhumiliated them, they tortured them, they -- and -- and then they started forming slave battalions\nin -- wh-which had to work under inhumane conditions. That was the time when there was free --\nI mean, it was e -- it was legal, and they were free to move, to go to the Italian zone, or go to\nthese remote mountains, provided of course, they had the proper connections with -- with the\nGreek villagers. And that\u2019s what was missing, since they did now know what was going to\nhappen. But wh-wh-why do -- should they accept deportation? I mean, isn\u2019t it better to be free?\nAnd think of all the tons of gold and precious items and supplies which were looted by the\nGermans and their collaborators. Can you imagine if all this gold and supplies would have come\nto the resistance? And let\u2019s think of how much the -- the Jews would have contributed to that\nresistance, because we had thousands of men who were experienced fighters from the war\nagainst Turkey in \u201921 and \u201922, and the war, the second World War. You have experienced\nfighters who would never surrender, because any Jewish partisan who would be captured by the\nGermans would be executed. So you would have a -- a great contribution to the allied effort.\nWhat a -- a -- a waste of -- of -- of manpower, and a-as a former military officer, I can say this, I\nremember the -- a poem by Haim Nachman Bialik, who said -- but it was related to something\nelse, but the words are very appropriate. Great -- great is the sorrow, and just as great is the\nshame. And I ask you, oh son of man, which is greater? The grandsons of the Maccabeans went\nto their death like lambs, wherever they were found. And to see what some of these grandsons of\nthe Maccabeans could do, I will tell you something about the -- perhaps the greatest partisan\nvictory of the second World War, which took place on May sixth, 1944. I said before there were\nthousands of Greek traitors who were not punished after the war. There was a group of five\nJewish families from Larisa, who established a camp on the slopes of Mount Olympus. They\nwere betrayed, and an s -- n-s -- SS battalion went one morning and captured them. Three Jewish\nmen attempted to escape, and they were killed. The f -- a fourth man was able to escape and\nnotified a nearby partisan unit of ELAS, which included Jewish fighters, like the legendary\nplatoon leader, Marko Carasso, and even a cousin of mine who was a -- a teacher of literature,\nJoseph Matsas. 150 partisans ambushed the Germans. The terrain was perfect for an ambush.\nThe battle lasted for around six hours. German planes came to help the Germans but they were\nineffective. The Jews eventually were liberated. There were 150 German dead, 78 wounded, and\n14 taken prisoners, including one who was the son of the German general of the Aegean. He sent\na message that he would release 200 hostages that he had for his son, but the message arrived too\nlate. The partisans executed the 78 wounded, and the 14 prisoners for a total of 242 German\ndead. And the Germans never again attempted to go to the mountains to capture fugitive Jews.\nPartisan losses were eight dead, and 10 wounded. I have the names of the eight dead, and I\nbelieve they should be considered as righteous Gentiles, because they could very easily have said\nwe don\u2019t want to try to save the Jews. So far, I mean, this can show you what the partisans could\nhave done.",
        "Q: Do you think the Jews of Greece in 1943 knew what was happening in Europe, in eastern\nEurope?",
        "A: There was, until the end of the war, there was not even one Jew in Greece who knew anything\nabout the Holocaust or about the fact that the Germans were killing Jews. Not a single thing.\nWhy? Because the Germans had t-total secrecy. As a matter of fact, Professor Breitman mentions\nthat the Germans attempted to -- to keep this secret from -- especially the Jews, but also from the\noutside world and the German people. They were successful in deceiving the Jews, but they were\nunsuccessful in keeping it secret from the outside world or the German people. In Greece not\neven one Jew knew anything. The first time that we understood what was going on was in the\nmovies when we saw Eisenhower visiting the concentration camps. If we knew what was going\non, there are survivors who say that under no circumstances would they have entered the trains\nor the trucks. Who would do that, to -- to -- to take his -- his children, his wife, his parents, in an\norderly fashion to the trains that led them to -- to -- to the -- to the death camps. As a matter of\nfact there have been cases like I mentioned before the -- the 75 Jewish communists who returned\nto follow their families and there are two cousins of my father from Ioannina who were also on\nbusiness on the day of the arrest, and they returned to Ioannina to be with their families in exile,\nand they never came back. Nobody knew.",
        "Q: So what was the difference between your family, who decided not to stay, not to register, to\nleave, and those who decided to stay? How would you distinguish between you, since you didn\u2019t\nknow either --",
        "A: Is this the --",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t -- your family didn\u2019t know either, what was happening.",
        "A: This is correct, but we had connections. In other words, we had the right wing friend who --\nwho told us where to go. We had the left wing friend who told us come to our house and we will\nsend you out. If we didn't have these two people, we would have, if nothing else, procrastinated.\nTwo days after we left on October third, two Germans appeared in the bank, and they asked for\nmy father. Now, if we judge as to this visit from what happened in other cities, my assumption 1s\nthat my father was going to be a hostage of the Germans, and if he were a hostage of the\nGermans, my mother would never have left him to -- a-and go to the mountains, even if we were\nallowed to do that. And -- and another thing is this, we left before the order for registration came.\nWe did not know there was going to be any order for registration. We left only because we heard\nthat the Jews of Athens went into hiding, we didn\u2019t know why. We simply -- we were simply\ndetermined not to obey any German orders, that was our only -- but we had friends. This is the --\nthe -- the problem that I -- I see with all the Jews. They did not have any friends, they didn\u2019t\nknow what to do. If you have people around the neighborhood who -- who are glad that these\nthings happen to you, and they are eag -- they are eagerly waiting to see what kind of looting\nthey are going to do, and there was extensive looting in every city where there were Jews, they\nare eager to see their competitors being demolished, how in the world do you expect any\nassistance from these people? And considering that -- that the Jews did not know that deportation\nmeant anything but deportation, and -- and having leaders who could not really lead them, and\nnot having any good advice by their friends, they were waiting. Now, once you are registered,\nthe story changes. Then what you do is dangerous if you try to leave. Of course, the friend of --\nof Veria, with the 85 year old mother, left while they were registered, and while they had the\nyellow star, and my friend said that as soon as he was in free territory, they took the star and they\nthrew it to -- to the ground. But it took much more bravery on their part to do it. That\u2019s why the\nmost important thing in Greece is that the -- the deportations started very late, in March of 1943.\nThe Jews of Poland were already dead. The Warsaw ghetto uprising was taking place at the exact\nsame moment, around March, April, 1943. Up til that time, the Jews of Greece had plenty of\ntime to disappear and dissolve, you know, in -- into eight million Greeks in a remote -- in\n[indecipherable] mountains, whereas I told you, the Germans had to mount expeditions including\n600 men, that -- that was not easy. And even if they did, where could they go the -- since there\nwere no roads, and -- and there were impenetrable forests and -- and terrib -- terrible mountains\nand -- and -- and unknown parts. Plus, there were the partisans there. So the situation in Greece\nwas great for the Jews to -- to -- to escape. In addition to that the -- the Jews would have gone to\nTurkey, because the partisan organization, the naval branch of the partisan organization called\nELAN had formed a -- in -- in agreement with the Jewish defense force Haganah, they\ntransferred some 1500 Jews from Greece to Turkey and from there to Palestine. Even the prime\nminister of Greece, George Papandreo used this method of escape from Greece. So there was this\nin addition. I believe since there were so many traitors, including six Jewish traitors, and I -- I\nwould like to -- to mention something about them, too. I mean, we were not innocent, we had six\nJewish traitors, all in collaboration with the Germans. So the -- since there were so many traitors\nin the city, so I would say the approximately 6,000 Jews of Greece who were saved, were saved\neither by going to the free partisan controlled areas, and -- or they stayed with -- in that work of\nresistance sympathizers in Athens who volunteered their services, and there are no cases where\nthe [indecipherable] for example, they w -- they were appointed to go into the house for one\nman, but the -- the -- well, 1 -- this is a case where it shows how the Italians were very helpful in\nSalonica, where they saved hundreds of Jews by giving them Italian citizenship, and they moved\nthem to -- to Athens. But in the case of the [indecipherable], what they did was they acted as if\nthey were prisoners of the Italians who were going to be judged 1n an Italian court in Athens. So\nthey were taken to the Italian zone, and then to Athens, but the Italian soldiers knew the address\nwhere the resistance told them to go. They di -- because these people did not know anybody in\nAthens. How could you go to Athens unless you know somebody? So the resistance provided a\nplace for them. So the Italian soldiers went to the house, and they said, do you know something?\nWe went to our commander, and we told him that we brung -- brought the prisoners here, but he\nsaid where are the prisoners and we couldn\u2019t produce you, so how about if you give us some\nmoney? So the SS were afraid of blackmail on the part of the Italian soldiers. They gave them\nsome money and then they notified the resistance they were to leave this house. And sure enough\nthe resistance says all right, you go to that house. Went to that house, and -- and they stayed in\nthat house until the end of the war, reading Mr. [indecipherable] all the books that he found\nthere, teaching French the grandchildren of the -- of the men, and the man was very proud\nbecause he saved, he said, a -- a British soldier, a communist and now a -- aj -- a -- a couple of\nJews. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a combination. You had to know somebody, which --what [indecipherable]\nthe poor Jews of Salonica, there was a lot of poverty in Salonica, they did not know anybody.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll have to stop now.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",

        "Q: How long was it?",
        "A: It -- 1t had at least wa -- 150 pages. It was handwritten. And so I gave it to my teacher of\nliterature, I -- I was pretty good in -- in composition at that time, and he was very glad to see that\none of his students wrote something that looked like a novel. The title was, \u201cOne Year in the\nMountains.\u201d So he was very glad, but I wil -- I was waiting and waiting, six months later he gave\nit back to me. I asked him what was his opinion. He -- he said, ju -- ju -- just take it, you know, I\n-- | -- | -- he did not even reply as to whether he read it or not. So I went home and I told my\nparents, this is my manuscript, I gave it to Mr. Papachristos and he gave it back to me. My father\ntook a look, he -- he saw partisan songs there, at the time that the -- everything was going bad for\nthe former partisans, so he was very handy and he made a hiding place under the -- the dining\nroom table. It remained there, we forgot about it, from 1945 til 1963 when my parents were\ngoing to come to the United States and they were getting rid of their furniture because they were\ngoing to rent the house in Athens. At that time my father didn\u2019t know what to do with this. He\nwas afraid that the Greek custom officials would see it, or the American custom officials would\nsee it, and what would they say, so he burned it without asking my permission for it. There was\nnothing there that would have disturbed neither the Greeks nor the Americans.",
        "Q: And how come you didn\u2019t take it with you when you came to the United States?",
        "A: We forgot all about it, I didn\u2019t think anything of it, it\u2019s -- this was -- I had other priorities you\nknow, and we didn\u2019t even talk about it.",
        "Q: So once your father put it away, no one else saw it?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: My father th-thought that this was terrible material to write at that time.",
        "Q: So were you angry at him for burning it?",
        "A: Not really, because I had it all in my mind. And I kept singing these songs, so I didn\u2019t forget\nthem.",
        "Q: Are there any other songs other than the one that you sang earlier --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- that you\u2019d like to share with us?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: They\u2019re wonderful songs.",
        "A: Once I gave a recital, my only recital, in the partisan hospital. We went to the village called\nTatanna, and the -- the doctor of the hospital -- I mean, we went there because my father needed\nsome medicine, and the doctor asked me, \u201cDo you sing any songs?\u201d I said, \u201cYes I do.\u201d He says,\nwould you like to come, th -- this was a monastery and in a big room they had convalescent\npartisans, and I sang all the songs I -- I knew.",
        "Q: So why don\u2019t you sing one or two more for us?",
        "A: One more. This one is talking about how tonight we\u2019re going to sleep outdoors on -- on the\ngrass, and 1s -- is talking about love for the country -- for -- for Greece. And then the -- the line\nthat is very significant is that s -- it says, let the -- the king of the underworld to come and see\nwith what kind of men he is going to tangle with, and let him select whom he wants to take down\nto the earth. [sings in Greek]. That\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Tell me, are these songs sort of -- were they written s-specifically by the partisans, are these --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes, by -- by mu -- musi -- partisan talented musicians.",
        "Q: So when -- when the war was over and you were now in 1945 -- 1944 --",
        "A: 15.",
        "Q: -- fi -- 15 years old. And you went back and finished school --",
        "A: Yes, high school.",
        "Q: -- finished high school, and then did you then go on to college?",
        "A: Well, that was -- I -- I finished one year earlier in -- in but -- at the age of 17. Then, after this\nepisode with the permit, I went to -- to Athens and I had to study something like 15 hours a day\nin a preparatory kind of course. Because there they don\u2019t have pre-med or pre-dent, all these\nsubjects, organic, inorganic chemistry, biology and anthropology and literature, you -- you have\nto go and take the exams. The exams were very difficult, there were 820 candidates for 30\npositions, and I came 17\". And that\u2019s how I entered the university. And my 1953, I graduated as\na dentist, and then I waited for a few months, I did not know any English at that time. And I went\nto a private teacher who studied, tell me c - a - t, cat, d- o - g, dog, and then I took with me a\nmethod without a teacher when I went into the army. This book is -- is -- has a very interesting\nstory, because when my father was drafted in the army, he thought that this was some sort of a\npicnic because he was assigned in a desk job, and so he -- he was fat and he took with him all\nkinds of sweets, and all kinds of underwear and all that. And this big without a teacher English\nmethod. But the Germans attacked on April sixth, and the orders changed, and every man was\nsent to the front on foot. So with the f-first stop my father got rid of all the sweets, emptied\neverything that -- because he couldn\u2019t walk that -- the -- the way se -- some other soldiers were\nable to. So he put everything down, including the English book. To make the long story short, on\nthe way back he pass through the same area, everything has been cleared, with the exception of\nthe English book, which was full of mud and its pages were broken di -- people had stepped on\nit. He took it with him, eventually he cleaned it, he repaired it, and that was the book that I took\nwith me in the army, and that\u2019s how I started learning English, and now this has a -- a place of\nhonor in my library.",
        "Q: And you had intended to come to the United States?",
        "A: Oh no, no. I -- if you are an officer in the Greek army in the medical corps at that time, yo-\nyou -- you were supposed to serve for three years. And th -- during that time I was studying both\nFrench and English, and a-actually I wanted to go to France for six months after the three years,\nto -- to learn something and have some break, you know, after all these years. Well, my parents\npersuaded me that if I wanted to go for a post-graduate course I should go to America. And that\u2019s\nhow I came here to Georgetown Dental School for a post-graduate course. This -- but when I\ncame to the United States, within the first five days in New York, I liked it so much that I\nthought I wasn't going to go back to Greece. So I realized that the un -- that the post-graduate\ncourse was of no use, the -- I had -- Greek or any European dental degree were not recognized.\nGeorgetown University did not accept me. They told me if you want to get a Master\u2019s or Ph.D.,\nwe'll give it to you, but we are not going to give you what you need to become a -- a DDS. So I\nwent to Howard University, and I went there as a sophomore. I finished sophomore, junior and\nsenior year and then I became an instructor at Howard, and then I opened a private practice. And\nlater on I went also as an assistant professor for a -- one day a week for three years. And then --",
        "Q: So you went as an undergraduate to Howard?",
        "A: Y-Yes, sophomore, yes.",
        "Q: And then your degree from Greece was accepted?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So how -- how --",
        "A: I got the -- I got the degree from Howard. I -- I -- I passed the boards on the basis of the DDS\nfrom Howard University. But I worked there as full time instructor for two years. And then I\nopened my own private practice, which -- and I be -- became a retired dentist in 1995.",
        "Q: What -- what so attracted you when you came to New York? Why did you like it so much?",
        "A: Why -- I liked the Fifth Avenue, Central Park. I went to a play, \u201cInherit the Wind,\u201d with Paul\nNewman. I went to all the museums, and I fell in love with America. I didn\u2019t know then what\nthey did during the war.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And when did you bring your parents over?",
        "A: My -- once I decided to stay here, that was in 1956, I -- my sister came in 1959 as a student at\nGW. And then when it was time that -- and I got married in 1960 -- when my sister was going to\nget married in 1963, then my parents came for the wedding and I also told them that we are both\nhere, why don\u2019t you come to stay with us? And they -- 1-1t was pretty nice for them because they\nwould stay with us, they didn't have to work. It -- 1t was like a continuous vacation, they would\nbe here for nine months, then in the summer they would go to Greece. They would make other\ntrips all over Europe and Israel. And -- and here they would go to Florida and California, so it\nwas very nice.",
        "Q: That\u2019s nice. And you have two children?",

        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Okay, Mike, what is this photo?",
        "A: This is in Ioannina, around 1932 to \u201933. I was there either two, two and a half, something like\nthat.",

        "Q: Could you tell -- sa -- tell us the names of your parents?",
        "A: My mother is Esther Matsas. Her parents were Gracia and Josef Kwen of Albania and my\nfather 1s Leon Matsas, who was born in Ioannina. It\u2019s interesting to know that my -- my mother\u2019s\nparents, my grandparents, survived in Albania, in Vergnon. Their house was the headquarters of\nthe German army in -- in Vergnon. And they lived with the Germans for the duration of the war.\nOnly on the last day that the Germans were leaving, they blew up and burned the house and the\nshops they had underneath, and they claim that this was done not because they were Jews, but\nbecause they did not have enough time to destroy their archives. Otherwise, none of the Jews of\nAlbania were -- was arrested.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This is 1945. My mother, father, my sister Minetta, and the suit that I wear is a suit that was\ngiven to me by the Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "Q: Okay. And this?",
        "A: This is myself in 1948 in Athens, with my cousin Sam Mayhere, who escaped from a German\nconcentration camp in Larisa. And he was almost executed by the partisans because they thought\nthat he was a sort of a -- a anti-ELAS German collaborator. And he was saved at the last moment\nwhen a partisan approached him and he told him, \u201cNow you say that you are a Jew, so we\nChristians when we go to bed at night, we make the sign of the cross, what do you Jews do?\u201d\nAnd Sam said, \u201cWe say Shema Yisrael,\u201d and he recited it for him, and the partisan embraced him\nand he told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, nobody will execute you.\u201d",
        "Q: And this is you?",
        "A: Yes. I have to say something more about my cousin. After the war my cousin opened a -- a sh\n-- a shop where he was selling milk and cheese. A policeman owed him a lot of money. When\nmy cousin pressed him to -- what are you going to do about what you owe me, the policeman\nwrote a report saying that he was a communist. So when they drafted him in the army, they took\nhim to an island, Makronsis, where they took all former partisans to re-educate them. Part of the\nre-education was to beat them up. So they -- they -- when my cousin wen -- went there, the\ncommander of the place realized they made a mistake, that this man was not a communist, he\nwas never a partisan. They didn\u2019t understand. Maybe my cousin explained to him what\nhappened. So they told him, all right, you are not one of them. Take a bamboo stick and let\u2019s go\nto beat them up. My cousin refused, so -- so they moved him to the communications service, and\nthat\u2019s how he was able to be on leave to -- to Athens. And that\u2019s when we got this picture.",
        "Q: Okay, Mike what\u2019s this?",
        "A: This is in the medical complex in [indecipherable] where we were studying physiology,\npharmacology, anatomy, etcetera. And -- and this is in front of a beautiful statue of Hippocrates.\nAnd I am there with one of my classmates.",

        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: And this is in -- on -- 1-it\u2019s a cave, a [indecipherable] cave where I went there escorted by a\nvillager who knew the area, and a lieutenant who was very much interested in knowing why I\nwent there, and maybe he suspected I was going to meet somebody in this cave.",
        "Q: And these were the caves where you were hiding at the end of the war, no?",
        "A: We -- well, no, no, not th -- in the end of the war. In -- in the -- during the first time that the\nGermans occupied the village, which they occupied only once, that was the time that we went to\nthe house of -- of this man and his father. And at that point we saw a line of villagers\napproaching and I thought that they were the Germans and I said, the Germans are here. And\nwhen I said that, we all ran in the forest. When the -- the father of this man saw that we were so\nafraid of the Germans, he said, well if that\u2019s the case, you -- you\u2019d better not stay in my house,\nand I will take you to the -- to a cave where you can stay during the day and come to sleep wi --\nin our house at night. And that\u2019s how we were introduced to the cave.",
        "Q: And what was the name of that family?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. And so this is the son of the -- of the man. And this is a beautiful cave with\nall kinds of stalactites, stalagmites. Actually, at that time we were not so good in ecology and this\nwas -- nobody knew about the cave, so I still have a few stalactites from -- from the cave.",

        "Q: And this says 1954?",

        "A: I was born Ioannina, Greece, in 1930.",
        "A: My family are -- if we go back a few generations, they have been in Ioannina for I would say\nhundreds of years. And my father\u2019s family was mainly in the wine and cheese business. And my\ngrandfather on the part of my mother, he was a merchant.",
        "A: My father was an employee of the national bank of Greece.",
        "A: No, at that time women were minding their own houses, and they have maids to the do the\nwork, and they were very happy that way.",
        "A: I would say upper middle class.",
        "A: My parents, yes. One. One maid.",
        "A: In -- in Ioannina for five years, and then my father was transferred to Arta and then Preveza,\nand in 1940 we were in Agrini.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably the bank would do it with this -- their employees.",
        "A: I remember everything that happened from 1935 on, I have a very clear memory of\neverything.",
        "A: From -- we knew that there were Jews who were passing from Greece on their way to\nPalestine or other places. And I remember in 1938 a friend of my father told him that in case of\nneed, I would like you to change your identity and you and your family go to the house of my\nfather in a remote mountain village.",
        "A: Well, at that time seeing what it was happening in Germany, and seeing that we had a fascist\ndictatorship in Greece, everything was possible, yes.",
        "A: No, the -- the first time I was aware that there was something different if you are a Jew, was\nwhen I was going to the Jewish school, and we went for a parade, and then, although we came to\nthe staging point quite early, we had to wait and I didn\u2019t like that. So I told the teacher why are\nwe waiting, and other schools have come after us and they pass. And the teacher, who happened\nto be a Christian, said we are the Jewish school, that\u2019s why we have to wait. So I realized that\nbeing a Jew was not a good thing.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: My -- I don\u2019t remember that either.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, there were only 40 Jews in Agrinio, while there were almost 2000 in Ioannina,\nso there was a big difference. Agrinio was called also Vrahori, or Evraiohori, which means a\nJewish village. Why? Because in 1821, there were 200 Jewish families in Agrinio. And what\nhappened to these 200 Jewish families, I think has significant meaning and it explains in my\nopinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War. I counted in\nthe Yad Vashem list something like 124 names plus 40 spouses. And in my experience, I know\nof 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in that list, and they are not. But still the numbers\nare very small. And then, in addition to that, the losses of the Greek Jews were great. 89 percent\nwere transported outside of Greece and 87 percent were killed, or 67,000 Jews. So what\nhappened in 1821 was a very little known historic event. The Turks killed in Istanbul the Greek\npatriarch of Constantinople. And they forced four Jewish porters to throw his body to the sea.\nWhen this became known to what was then Greece, and at that time Greece was much smaller\nthan it is now, the 5000 Jews of Greece were massacred. A few who survived were converted to\nChristianity. One of the leaders of the Greek nation, Kanellos Deligiannis was a great righteous\nGentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews whom he hid in his house in Tripolitsa. The anti-\nJewish feelings of the population were so strong that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12\nJews hidden in his house for three years. And only in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to\nthe Ionian Island of Zakinthos which it was not then under Greek control. So, going back to\nAgrinio and the 40 Jews, these people have come mainly from Arta. There were many small\nmerchants and one of them was a teacher who during the war became one of the five leaders of\nthe resistance in our area. His name was Yunas Munis. I would say about Agrinio that Agrinio\nhas the distinct honor of being possibly the only city in German occupied Europe where all the\nJews did not obey any German regulations and they all survived. And I really can\u2019t think of any\nother city where something like that happened, but I should say that we were very fortunate that\nwe did not have a rabbi, and we did not have any community leaders, because in Greece the\nrabbis and community leaders, with one or two very rare exceptions proved to be totally\nincapable of facing the problems that the German occupation presented.",
        "A: That -- that -- that\u2019s correct, the -- we moved in Agrinion sometime in March of 1940, and\nyeah, Italy attacked Greece on October 28\", 1940. About this war I would like to say that the\nJewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great. Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the\narmy, and that included my father and many of my relatives. Over 500 were killed, including a\ncousin of my mother\u2019s. Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least two or three of our\nrelatives. To these numbers I would like to add the 1,600 Jewish Palestinian volunteers who\nserved with the British expeditionary force. And one of them was the father of the former Prime\nMinister of Israel, Shimon Peres, and he was not able to be evacuated with the British and he\nbecame a partisan of ELAS.",
        "A: I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek\nJewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with his troops, stopped the Italian advance, giving the\nallies their first victory of the second World War. Mordechai Frizis was killed.",
        "A: Ah, yes, that -- that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s quite --",
        "A: -- yes. In Agrinion we were only two Jewish boys among 1,000 students in the -- the high\nschool. And I\u2019m grateful to the people who were in charge, because every able bodied boy was a\nmember of the youth -- the fascist youth organization. And I\u2019m grateful to them for not knowing\nthat Jews were not allowed to join that fascist organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join\nthem. I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started.",
        "A: Because I never liked to be discriminated against. So being a fascist suit me fine, although I\ndid not realize that it was so bad at that time.",
        "A: No, no, they -- they did not. They -- w-we would parade, we would -- we -- we had lectures\nabout Greek nationalism. Th-There was nothing offensive as far as I know at that time, you\nknow, about th-this organization.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Until October 1940.",
        "A: Yes, then the school actually closed, and we were very glad that the classes ended, without\nrealizing what the war meant.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And a -- when the war started it closed, and then it started again in -- in other buildings, some\nwarehouses, because the school buildings were used as hospitals.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, everything the same.",
        "A: The Italians? F-First of all, remember that the war started on October 28\", but the -- and the\nGermans attacked in April of 1941. Only after that time the Germans first, and the Italians\nsecond, came. The Italians were excellent in Greece. While in Italy the 50,000 Jews lost their\ncivil rights in 1938 with Mussolini\u2019s Aryan manif -- manifesto, in Greece, thanks to the Italian\ncommander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all civil liberties. The -- we were able to -- to go\nto -- to the -- to school, while the Italians were not able to do that. Actually there were 94 Italian\nuniversity professors who were dismissed, five Italian Jewish admirals, and five Italian Jewish\ngenerals who were dismissed. But in Greece we enjoyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to\ncooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, the German general in the persecution of the\nJews. So we were very happy with the Italians, and we -- we lived a very normal life in the\nItalian zone, business was as usual, we went to the movies, and my mother was making cookies\nwhich a neighbor of hers, Maria Demardi used to send to partisan hospitals, once the partisan\nmovement became stronger.",
        "A: Life was absolutely beautiful for us under the -- under the Italians. And there -- there was one\nmoment that the Italians asked us to register, and none thought anything of it, and they\nregistered, and I know of only one person from Preveza who did not trust the Italians, only one.\nAnd he took his parents and went into hiding. Th-That\u2019s how he survived later on the Germans.\nBut we registered. And -- I\u2019m ashamed to say that. And 30 years later I found out that Mussolini\nmade a deal with the Germans that they were supposed to -- to arrest us, and move us to camps\nin the Ionian Islands and Italy. But of course, you know, Italy capitulated and this did not\nhappen, but the Germans came.",
        "A: We were surprised that the Italians behaved in such a nice way. I have to say that the\nGermans behaved very well too, when they entered our area.",
        "A: Yes. Sometime at the end of April, 40 -- \u00b041. Only in Salonica they did not behave well, but\nin our area they passed through and they did not bother anybody.",
        "A: I happened to be -- because my father was mobilized, we were in -- in Ioannina when the\nGermans came in first. And they behaved very well, they did not bother anybody, although the\nJewish community of 2,000 approximately, people existed there, and they -- they ju -- simply\npassed. And then the Italians came, and they behaved very well.",
        "A: Yes, from -- from Ioannina, once my father became a civilian again, we moved to Agrini, and\nmy father went back to his bank. In other words, the Germans passed through Ioannina --",
        "A: In \u201941, and since this was the Italian zone of occupation, they did not stay.",
        "A: The Italians were in charge until September of 1943.",
        "A: Then, once Italy capitulated, the Germans came in. When they came in Agrinio and they --\nthey loved the fact that the Italians were so afraid of the resistance and they had their buildings\nfortified, and with all kinds of guns around them, and they wanted to give a good lesson to the\nresistance. So 120 elite German troops went on 12 trucks and they moved straight towards the\nheadquarters of the partisans in the city of Thermi. What they did not know was that this lady I\nmentioned before with the cookies, Maria Demardi, who was fluent in German, had become the\ninterpreter for the German commander of Agrini. The partisans were waiting. Out of 120\nGermans, one wounded motorcyclist returned to Agrinion, and he -- even he died in -- within\ntwo days. And the Germans tried to keep it secret, and they did not even retaliate or shoot any\nhostages. Well, they learned their lesson and that meant that in the future they would not dare to\ngo to the mountains unless they had a very strong force, which served us very well later on.",
        "A: Well, from one point of view, you didn't -- it did not change much. There were little things,\nlike for example, the -- we had the neighbor, the director of the bank of agriculture, whose in --\nin -- the Germans wanted to -- to buy one of -- one room in his house. His mother wanted\nsomebody to go there while the Germans were in the house. She selected me. So here I am, a 15\nyear old Jewish boy, going there, you know, to protect the old mother. I find a very handsome,\nyoung German, very polite, and I thought we became friends because since he did not know\nGreek, and I did not know German, we played with the word good. And we figured out we knew\nit in Latin, ancient Greek, German, Fr-French, Italian, Spanish. I -- I knew it in Hebrew too, but I\nkept my mouth shut. And then all of a sudden I said, English, good. And the German became\nfurious and he slapped me. The mistake that I made was that I was thinking in terms of the word\ngood, and he was thinking in terms of people good. And obviously he didn't like the English\npeople. So I -- I understood that something was wrong. Another thing that happened was I was\nsitting in the balcony of my -- our apartment, and I saw a German chasing a young man who\nobviously was a -- a man of the resistance and he was shooting at him. The German entered the\ncourtyard of the house following the resistance man. The -- the man of the resistance passed\nthrough the first floor apartments and jumped out of the window right under my balcony. The\nGerman entered the courtyard and he saw the stairs leading to our house, and the door was open.\nHe ran through there, passed through a corridor, came right next to me in the balcony. He aimed\nat the resistance man down below, and he pressed the trigger. The gun jumped. The German\nlooked at me to see whether I was happy, but I was petrified. So he looked at this guy in disgust,\nand he left. Another thing that -- that happened was the Germans would send German soldiers to\nsearch the houses for weapons. And I remember a very polite, middle aged German knocked at\nthe door, my mother opened the door. He indicated he wanted to search, he opened one drawer,\nand my mother pretended that he was an honored guest and she treated him the way the -- a -- a\nguest is supposed to be treated in Greece by offering him some sweets, you know, in a little plate\nwith a spoon and a glass of water. The German felt embarrassed. He did not search anything else.\nHe bowed politely and he left. Another little --",
        "A: I was there, yes.",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t -- I mean, with the exception of the slap, that wasn\u2019t a very strong, I -- I didn't\nhave any bad experience. The next thing that happened was we bought a horse load of wheat.\nAnd the villager who brought the horse with the wheat told my father, in this bag there is a gun\nand ammunition for your friend Christos Bokoros, who was one of the leaders of the resistance.\nWell, my father wanted to get rid of the gun as soon as possible. So within a few minutes I had a\nbasket with the gun, the ammunition and some other unimportant items, and I was supposed to\ngo to the house of Bokoros. My father thought I was going to go through the back streets. Not\nme. I went through the -- through the main street, through the main square of Agrinion. I even\ntouched a German as I was passing. And I realized that what I was doing was dangerous only\nwhen I gave the gun to the sister of Bokoros, and I saw how -- how frightened she was. So\nbasically that\u2019s how our life was until one day -- Yunas Munis that I mentioned before, the\nteacher, went to my father and told him, you know something, the -- one of the merchants, I\nthink it was either Misann or Munis, went on business to Athens to buy merchandise. And he\nfound out that all the Jewish shops were closed, and he was told that the Jews went into hiding.\nSo he came back to us, and he told everybody, and we are all going to leave, and I\u2019m leaving\ntomorrow morning. So we -- although we didn\u2019t know why the Jews went into hiding, we were\nnot going to -- to wait. And we got ready to go, but we didn\u2019t know where to go. So we asked\none neighbor who was a right wing man. He told us to go to Arta, and from Arta to go to the area\nof -- of Zerbes, General Zerbes who was the right wing partisans. The only problem is how --\nhow do you go from Agrinio to Arta, you know, it was a good idea, but it\u2019s not possible to --\nthere was no real transportation and up til that time, we were using mainly Italian cars for the\nmovement to different cities. So we asked our other friend, Christos Bokoros, who was with the\nleft wing resistance, and he said, well, come to our house, and I will provide transportation. In o -\n- in other words, in -- in Greece, even a f -- a f -- man like my father, who was an assimilated\nJew with -- all his friends were Christians, you know, because they would not -- he didn\u2019t have\nthat much in common with the little merchants who were there. We were friendly, but all his\nfriends were Christians. Still, we did not know what to do, we needed help. So we went to the\nhouse of Bokoros, and he was going to provide transportation with horses, but all the horses\ndisappeared because a battle was taking place, and both sides used all available forces. And my\nfather, who was a good bank employee, he wanted to give his books in good order to the director\nof the bank, and transfer also the money. And he was wasting time. A -- a German soldier\nentered the house of Bokoros to just look around. The Bokoros family became scared. So one of\nthe Bokoros boys went to the bank and he told the director, and saw Mr. Matsas working there, if\nanything happens to him, I will consider you responsible. The director, knowing that the Bokoros\nfamily was with resistance told him I -- I don\u2019t keep him here, I will sign everything away. Sure\nenough, he signed the money -- for the money and everything without even counting it, and my\nfather went to wait with [indecipherable] in the house. Well there, since h-he couldn\u2019t find any\nhorses, he go, how about a tax1? Sure enough, he brought the taxi there, we loaded all our food\nsupplies, clothing and everything else, and put it -- some more people in the taxi, and we left in\nstyle. Within minutes we were at the control point, a German soldier checked the identity cards\nof the people. The driver gave to the German some cookies and raisins, and that was the last\nGerman I saw. Nobody had violated any rules or regulations, and nothing was punishable, there\nwas no crime involved. We simply went out, and that was it. Within minutes we saw the first\npartisan of ELAS. And I have to say I took a look at his hat, and I saw the word ELAS and I\nthought I discovered a spelling mistake. Ellas, which means Greece, is written with two |\u2019s, and\nhe had ELAS with one | because this was the ethnic [indecipherable] status, meaning Greek\nliberation army.",
        "A: We knew nothing.",
        "A: We knew nothing. All we knew that these people were fighting the Germans and only\nactually after the war we found out that many of the leaders were communists. But they were\nfighting the Germans, the -- they did not know any more than we did, and all I know 1s that they\nhad beautiful songs which I loved and I still sing.",
        "A: Oh boy. Yes, why not? You mean now?",
        "A: All right. I will give you the translation first. One of them starts like that, that there\u2019s thunder\nin the mount of Olympus, and there is lightening in the mouth -- th-the mount of Jonah. The\nmountain [indecipherable] are roaring and [indecipherable] is shaking. And then it extols him,\nasks all the people to take up arms and fight for freedom. So, [sings in Greek here]. That\u2019s one of\nthem.",
        "A: So, with a taxi we went to the end of the road, s-some 30 miles away from Agrinio. And then\nwe rented horses, because we wanted to be as far away from roads as possible. And we pass\nthrough really unmarked paths, there were no wheels in that village of Psilovrahos. The people\nthere, unless they went to a city, they never saw a wheel, because it was very difficult terrain on\nthe slopes of a mountain. But very beautiful, overlooking a river, which now became a -- a lake,\nthanks to a dam that they made. We went there as students. We knew that nobody would bother\nus because the village was very well organized in terms of the resistance. Th-There -- there was -\n- there was active ELAS, which were the partisans, and there was reserve ELAS. So there were\norganizations for the men, for the women, everything was organized. So -- so it was a nice place\nto be. We brought with us a lot of supplies to last us for a year. The problem was that in\nNovember, the Germans decided to go on a search and destroy mission, and the -- we were\nnotified ahead of time -- the villagers were not afraid that anything would happen to them, but\nwe -- and in the meantime I should say some more Jews came to -- to the village, knowing that\nwe were there. There were two men, and another three people, a couple and a old man who did\nnot even know Greek, he was a ship tycoon, Aaron Romano, who was speaking in French rather\nthan Greek. And so we were --",
        "A: Certainly.",
        "A: We rented. We rented a room. This -- we had with us plenty of money. My father\nunfortunately had only cash. He did not have any gold, that was a big mistake, because thanks to\ninflation, the money lost all it\u2019s value within months. So we rented a place, we acted like tourists.\nWe didn\u2019t hide the fact that we were Jews. As a matter of fact we were going to the church every\nSunday because we didn\u2019t want the -- the people to think that we were different, with the\nexception of the fact that we would not make the sign of the cross, or eat the wafers, or the pieces\nof bread that y-you know, a -- a Christian is supposed to -- to have at the end of the service. So\nwith the exception of that, we were very friendly with the priest, who used to come to my\nmother\u2019s place because we were the only ones who had coffee, and he liked to have coffee. And\nthe life was beautiful, and the -- it was li-like a vacation, until the Germans came. When they\ncame, we -- by now we were f-four of us, and two, six, we were nine -- four, seven -- we became\n10 Jews in the village. And we decided, and the people of the resistance told us that we should\ngo higher up, and they told us that there is a house very high up in the mountain of 300 feet, and\nyou should go there and stay there. So there were only two little donkeys that could be used for --\nfor supplies. So we loaded a little donkey, but un-unfortunately we had to leave all our supplies\nin the room. And we went to the -- to the top of the -- of the mountain, to the house of\n[indecipherable] and we stayed there, and the Germans stayed in the village for -- I -- I should\nadd that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy, a socialite from Athens decided she had enough, she wasn\u2019t\ngoing to go any -- any further, and she stayed in the village. And she spoke fluently German and\nFrench. And she spoke with the German officers very, very well, and -- and n-none of them\nasked her how come a lady like her ends up in a village like that. And -- and it didn\u2019t take long\nand the Germans left, and we came back. When we came back, we found out that we lost all our\nsupplies. Now, the owner of the house, who has a reputation as a thief claimed that it was the\nGermans who took it, who took everything. My mother went right into their house and searched\nand she found some of our items. The -- later on we found out when the villagers made the report\nas to how -- what things they lost, 1t was mainly bottles of Ouzo, bottles of wine, and they would\nsay, with the entire bottle. Because for them the bottle was more precious than the contents of\nOuzo and wine, which they could make by themselves. Therefore, I\u2019m convinced that it was this\nman, [indecipherable] who was the thief, and not the Germans. But we knew that the partisans, in\norder to establish some sort of tranquility and -- and e-eliminate [indecipherable] and fear, they\nhave killed even a partisan who stole a -- a chicken. And therefore, we decided to keep quiet, not\nto report him [indecipherable] the family. We wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for an execution.\nAnd we thought, well, we have more supplies in Agrinion and we will bring them. Unfortunately\nwe were not able to bring as many supplies as we needed, so we had some starvation later on.\nNow, the fact that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy decided to stay and the Germans were very polite,\nturned against us the following month, because the Germans made three attempts at research -- at\nsearch and destroy operations. In November, in December, and in the following August. So, in\nDecember there was another alarm that the Germans were approaching. This time, Mrs.\n[indecipherable] Levy persuaded my mother that the Germans are not dangerous they behaved so\nwell. My mother didn\u2019t like the idea of going up to the mountain, but also, she didn\u2019t want to\nabandon our supplies for fear that -- that they will be stolen again, although we had to change\nrooms because this man not only he resented the fact that we called him a thief, especially after\nwe found things hidden in his house, but he asked us to leave because we insulted him. He didn\u2019t\nrealize that we saved his life. And we moved to another room that we also rented. So my mother\ndecided to -- to help Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy in her room, since the knew German so well,\nand -- and stay there. But a neighbor who saw that, told the lady -- she was a -- a\n[indecipherable] a former policeman and his son was a partisan and he told them, what makes\nyou believe that there will be the same Germans, or they will became -- they will be just as polite\nas they were before, or they might not have orders to ar-arrest you as suspicious individuals. So\nshe forced them to come up to the mountain lake with it, but fortunately the Germans did not\ncome this second time in the village. Are you curious about what happened the third time, in\nAugust?",
        "A: In --",
        "A: -- in between, with the exception that we faced starvation because the -- the war between the\nGermans and the partisans intensified, and while before it was so easy to get in and out of\nAgrinion, it became more difficult. So the end result was that -- that it was not easy to send a\nvillager in the bank where my father had stored his supplies and get from a -- one his friends\nthere, who was -- he was -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to understand that, but the bank was trying to help the\nemployees even with food supplies. So one of the rooms in the bank had food, and an employee\nwould take care of food distribution to the employees of the bank. So this man also had our\nsupplies with instructions when my father would send a man to get whatever we wanted, but this\nsource was -- was lost. So we -- we really suffered from -- from starvation. I mean, but this is not\n-- this is the least that can happen to you.",
        "A: Well, not -- not -- not -- it was -- it was bad only in Athens, not in the provinces.",
        "A: The provi -- provinces had plenty of food, and people from Athens would come to the\nprovinces to get food. In -- in Agrinion, as long as we were not [indecipherable] there was no\nproblem, it was like peacetime. I mean, you had as much food as you wanted. Only when we lost\nour supplies and we were not able to get the quantities that we needed, only then -- we had\nbasically to eat a lot of wild vegetables. I had -- that was my job. I had to go, with a knife, and\nget anything that was green on the ground, all over the place, that the animals would not eat\nbecause they were -- these things were bitter. And then my mother would boil these things and\nmix them with a little corn flour and she would put just enough oil on the -- on the big, big pot,\nand cook them. I found out eventually that this cellulose can be absorbed by the body. So\nbasically, that\u2019s what kept us alive, because we could eat enormous quantities of these because I\nwould get, you know, bi-big quantities and we would eat that. Basically, that\u2019s what th -- that\u2019s\nwhat it was. The one thing I can say 1s that at -- what helped us at one point was the fact that a\npartisan unit came to stay in the village. And we told them that we were starving. And they\noffered to de -- I mean, they -- at -- at night, when they had their meetings, all the partisans voted\nin favor of giving us a -- a portion. And also to the family of [indecipherable] Levy. And -- and\nwhen the -- the trumpet would -- would sound, I would go in line and get a portion -- the\npartisans were not fed very well either, mainly th-they had a corn soup. That\u2019s -- that was -- and\na few olives. But we would divide that portion that was for one man, we would divide it into\nfour. And in this way, w -- for the duration of their s -- their stay in Psilovrahos which was\nmaybe 20 - 25 days, we did not touch our supplies. That proved to be very, very important\nbecause ultimately we did not have anything. And on that day, one of the men of the village --\nactually he was the leader of the reserve ELAS, he -- he told me to -- to go and collect berries,\nand by that time there were berries, as many as you wanted. And I did. We ate berries for four\ndays and we all became sick. At that point we didn\u2019t know what to do because the\n[indecipherable] production was going to come within days, but not in our village, which was on\nthe mountain. So my mother and I took the last supply that we had, which was sugar, and we\nwent down, we crossed the river of [indecipherable] and we went to a [indecipherable] village of\na [indecipherable]. And there we exchanged sugar, which nobody had, for [indecipherable],\nwhich was some cereal that had milk. And that was the turning point in -- in our food situation.\nOnce the time came that the villages had produced -- had -- had a lot of things, 1-1-1n the\nmeantime we -- we realized what we had to do, but that\u2019s a little -- it\u2019s a little -- another story,\nbecause we had -- well, where to find parachute material, but this happened accidentally. When e\n-- in April, or at the beg -- at the end of March, my mother decided that she sh -- would go to\nAgrinion and get supplies. And my father and myself -- I-I was at that time 13 going on 14, my\nsister was only five to six, so my father an-and myself told her not to go, but she was very str --\nopinionated and she decided to go. And she walked for practically 12 hours to go to Agrinion.\nAnd at one point she had to cross a -- a -- a bridge, and one of the guards there was a partisan -- a\nJewish partisan [indecipherable] from Arta, that my mother knew him. And he told her, don\u2019t\nyou know that the -- the -- the Jews have been arrested, and they are in Agrinion in warehouse of\nPapapetrou? Of course my mother did not know anything, but she -- I have to say that before that\nmy mother was stopped by a -- a teacher of mine who recognized her, and he told her, where are\nyou going? Don\u2019t you know that the Jews have been arrested, and in addition, don\u2019t you know\nthat the Germans executed some 200 Christian hostages because of the war that takes place\nbetween the Germans and the partisans. And my mother said that -- of course she felt very bad,\nand sick about -- hearing about the Jews, but she was determined, and she said, I have to go, I\nhave to get food. So the -- the teacher said, why don\u2019t you go until the village that is very close\nto -- to Agrinion, and -- and stop there at the mailbox, and th-this is a house of a godfather of\nmine, and he 1s a teacher in the village. You tell them that I sent you, and send him to Agrinion\nto get the food. So my mother explained to the partisan [indecipherable] that this is my plan, and\nI\u2019m not going to go beyond this little village, which was in the outskirts of Agrinion, and he let\nher go, and that\u2019s what happened. She met the teacher. The teacher went with his horse to the\nbank. He happened to be a godf -- he was a godfather of the director of the bank -- this is a\ntremendous coincidence considering that [indecipherable] is the director of the bank, was\nsupposed to be a descendant of the families which were converted in 1821. Svordis was a\ncommon Jewish name in Ioannina. Svordis could have been also one of the -- the convert\nfamilies. And my father claims that even the intermediary between the two of them, Zambaris,\nthat was the nickname of the Levy family of Ioannina. So, it -- it\u2019s a -- an amazing coincidence\nto have all these three people being godfathers to each other, and been involved in helping my\nmother at this point. Now, when he went to the bank with the horse in front of it, the director\nbecame terrified. I mean th-th-th -- under these conditions, getting food on a horse that is going\nto go outside of the city, the whole bank can be considered guilty of doing something wrong, as\nfar as the Germans and their collaborators, and there were plenty by that time. There were the\nsecurity -- Greek security battalions active at that time. So the only thing we were able to get\nthanks to that expedition was some quinine and some sugar and some tea that could be placed in\nthe pocket of -- and when the man came back, he was not satisfied to leave my mother there, it\nwas a-approaching nighttime when neither the partisans would allow anybody to move, nor the\nGermans. So he proposed to my mother that they should go to sleep in a small church that his\ngrandfather had built of prophet Elia. Even that to me is significant. And [indecipherable] went\nand zamp -- Zambaris -- that\u2019s name, Zambaris and my mother spent the night in that little\nchurch on top of the mountain where it was cold, and the wind was blowing. Then the following\nday, my mother came back to the village. When she told us what was -- what happened, o-of\ncourse she was exhausted, you know, a-after 24 hours and -- and the trauma of knowing, a-and --\nbecause they made a mistake and they told her that the Jews of Ioannina were also there, which\nmeans that all our relatives were there. So she was really a wreck. But in spite of that, she wanted\nto go on another expedition in which the British mission which was in Priansa. That time we\nwere assured that as soon as the allies would know that the Jews were arrested, they would\nimmediately mobilize all their know-how and all their means at their disposal and the Jews\nwould be s-set free. So again my mother -- you see, my -- my father had some problems, he had\nsome pain with his legs, and he couldn\u2019t walk at that time. So my mother again, and myself, we\nembarked on an expedition of approximately a total of 14 hours of hiking in unknown territory,\ncrossing and re-crossing two rivers. That means four times crossing rivers to go there. And we\nwent to the village of Priansa where we had a meeting with a British major who -- his friend, a --\na prostitute who was there told us -- well, I-I should say this, passing on the way there, we had to\nstop in a -- 1-1n a controlled partisan point, which was manned by our banker from Agrini. And\nhe told us [indecipherable] we -- we told him what was our mission, what we wanted to do. And\nhe told us to go to this lady. There were other prostitutes there who were so-called working for\nthe British mission. And he told us that this particular girl was the girlfriend of the British major,\nbut evidently, she was also in contact with the resistance. And he told my mother to go to her and\nshe will be able to talk to the -- to the major so the major will -- would be a little bit better to us.\nBut when we went there and we found her, the first thing that she did when she saw how I was\ndressed, because I was -- I was wearing my short fascist uniform, a blue uniform that it was\nstrong material, but because my legs were exposed, my mother had s -- had sewn or attached to\nthem some woolen leggings. So I was dressed like that. Soon as she saw that, she gave me the\nleftover [indecipherable] khaki pair of wi -- winter khaki pants that she had cut them to make\nshorts out of them, and she gave us the leftover, you know, so my mother can make some -- a\nbetter pair of pants for me. And she said that she had an argument with the major and he was not\nin a good mood. But nevertheless, the -- the m-major saw us, and he was very nice, and he knew\nFrench so my mother spoke to him in French. And he promised to send a message to -- to the\nheadquarters, and a -- a message to my father\u2019s sister who lived at that time in Alexandria,\nEgypt. But we know that the message in Alexandria, Egypt never went. But we were in that\nvillage, we realized that the village was filled with parachute material because the planes were\ncoming at night and they were dropping weapons and ammunition for the resistance. And there\nwas plen-plenty of parachute material. So my mother went from house to house and she begged\nthese villagers, who didn\u2019t know what to do with this material, and we collected a lot of material,\nand cord, and everything else. And when we came back, my mother, who had an elementary\nknowledge of sewing, she went into the business of -- of -- shall I stop? Yes. She went into the\nbusiness of making shirts, and we used some material th-that we brought for mattresses, to make\npants out of them. And eventually she changed these materials by going to different villages --\nvillages for years, you know, did not have any material. And we collected enough wheat and\ncorn and everything else to last us for the next two or three years. And but this -- this is the story\nthat is related to food. I -- I bet --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: We found out about it much later. Who -- what happened was this. The Germans asked the\nchief rabbi of Athens, Elia Barzelai to give them a list of the Jews of Athens. The rabbi of course\nhad -- was given sa -- some time to prepare the list and during that time the Jews of Athens, or\nimportant Jews of Athens found out or they knew about it. And one of them was a -- a Greek\nJewish journalist, Baruch Schibi, who was one of the leaders of resistance in Athens. He was a\nman from Salonica who never intended to be in a place where the Germans were, and when the\nGermans were entering Greece, he attempted to leave and go to Egypt, and he reached only Crete\nand then you know when the Germans attacked Crete with the parachutists, h -- and he was not\nable to go to Egypt and he returned back to Athens. He knew what happened to Salonica. What\nhappened in Salonica was that the leadership with Rabbi Koretz proved to be very ineffective.\nAnd since the Jews did not know that the Germans were killing Jews outside of Greece, they did\nnot have the incentive that a hunted animal has. And you know, when somebody is hunted, the\ninstinct of survival of course, is you -- to either flee, hide or fight. The -- the situation was such\nthat although the German intentions towards the Jews of Salonica proved to be bad from the\nbeginning, only the wealthy Jews, some 3,400 of them took advantage of the fact that up til\nFebruary 1942, they were able to freely and legally move from the Bulgarian and German zones\nof occupation and go to the Italian zone, where the Italians were living very well as I told you\nbefore. The remaining Jews in Bulgaria and Macedonia, and that\u2019s where the great majority of\nthe Jews were, they did not know what to do. I feel they were like children who needed help, and\nnobody was ready to help them. So in Salonica the organization ELAS proposed to the\ncommunity to help, but the leaders of the community refused this help. The communist party\nproposed to help, and they suggested that the Jewish children should go to trusted families of the\nparty, and the rest of the population to be dispersed outside of Salonica as long as it was free and\nlegal to do -- to do so. But this proposal was rejected by the leaders also. So basically, you have\nsome over 50,000 Jews there not having any leaders, not knowing what was going on, and\nfurthermore, not having Christian friends, most of them, as a result of anti-Semitism. The\npopulation in Macedonia and Salonica was either indifferent or hostile to the Jews, and the proof\nis that out of over 10,000 Jewish families in Salonica, only one family, that of Haim Pardo, of\nfive people was offered a shelter in the house of Dr. George and Fedra Carracortso right in the\ncenter of Salonica where they stayed indoors for 18 months. There was some other 70 Jews who\nwere saved in Salonica, but these were mainly husbands, or fianc\u00e9s of Christians. The -- the\nuniversity, or the other organizations of Salonica did not protest, did not do anything, but some\nlawyers protested to the general governor -- the general governor Simonides, he said, we are\nremoving the thorns from your garden, and you are protesting? The -- the one who pleaded with\nthe Germans was the bishop of Salonica, Yanadios, who asked them to use magnanimity and\nclemency, especially when the time for the deportations came, and he -- he is considered as a\nrighteous Gentile. Another protest for which Greece should be really proud was made by the\narchbishop of Greece, Damaskinos, and it was signed by 42 members -- leaders of Greek\norganizations. And in this case, what really happened was that the -- these people would meet\nperiodically to discuss the problems of the occupation, and one day a Jewish woman from\nSalonica told him what was happening, and the poet [indecipherable] Yanosh wrote the appeal, it\nwas signed immediately by all 42, and it was delivered to the Germans, and to the government of\nGreece. The prime minister of Greece, Logothetopoulos, instead of trying to protect the Jews of\nSalonica when they were deported, he confessed that he was in favor of the deportations because\nthere would be a lot of vacant housing that was needed. So, 252 Jewish students from the\nUniversity of Salonica became partisans of ELAS, over 600 Jews became partisans of ELAS.\nWhen the proposals of the communist party were rejected, the communists th -- remember that\nthey had 150 members in their lists who were Jews. So they appealed to them to go to the\nmountains. Out of them, 75 decided to go, but as they were divided into three groups and they\nwere going for the mountains, they thought, and what about our families? How are we going to\nlet our families be by themselves in exile? And they came back and they surrendered to the\nGermans. Now, Baruch Schibi knew all that, and he was afraid that the same thing was going to\nbe repeated in Athens. So he conceived the plan of abducting or killing Rabbi Barzelai of\nAthens. The other leaders of the resistance agreed with his plan, and they went to the rabbi and\nthey told him. Rabbi was ready, he said I\u2019m -- do anything you want with me. And they took him\nand his family and they moved them to the mountains. When the word went around, the Jews of\nAthens disappeared. However, there were poor Jews who at the beginning they thought they\nwould hide too, but they needed to work. And they started going into the -- into the -- th -- to the\nGermans, and the Germans kindly extended their deadline and allowed all of the Jews who\nwould come slowly [indecipherable] they would come and the -- the Germans wouldn\u2019t do\nanything to them more, they would come -- this was noticed by none other than an American\nconsul general who was operating from Istanbul. And in the state department where there are 500\npages of documents sent from Consul Berry, Brigadier General Tindall, and Ambassador\nMakvay of [indecipherable] 500 pages. In one of them this situation is noticed by a b -- a --\nBurton Berry, who s -- who tells the state department that -- that we need a little financial\nassistance here because the poor Jews are reporting and now they tell them that they should\nreport within a 15 minute interval, which means that the Germans want to arrest them within that\n15 minute interval. All these reports were ignored, and filed in the archives, where I found them\nin 1975. Eventually 1,000 Jews of Athens were registered. But things became nice again.\nEverything was normal up til March of -- 25\"\" of March 1944. That was the time that the Jews of\nIoannina [indecipherable] that my mother was supposed to -- t-to find in Agrinion if she went\nthere, were all arrested. And the -- a-and -- and Burton Berry in another document says, didn\u2019t I\ntell you that this was going to happen? And -- and he gave other warnings. Actually, the most\nimportant warning that he gave was the following. There was a -- a -- a Greek Christian\nmerchant, Michael [indecipherable] who, a-as I said before, business was as normal as it could\nbe in Greece. He went on business, he was a tobacco merchant, and he was going on business to\nIstanbul. In his train compartment -- evidently he was traveling first class, he started a\nconversation with three German SS officers, who told him point blank that we are going to stop\nhere in Larisa because we are on our way to Corfu, where we will deport all the Jews of Corfu.\nIn other words, the Germans were so sure that nobody cared, especially a Christian merchant,\nthat they told him a military secret. Now, this man was a good man. As soon as he went to\nIstanbul, he went straight to the American consul -- consulate, and he told Burton Berry what\nwas happening. Burton Berry immediately notified the state department, and again nothing\nhappened, although it was so easy to make a radio contact with the British military missions.\nBritish military missions had contact with the resistance, which existed in all the cities, not to\nmention secret American and British agents which operated in Greece. All of these people could\nhave notified the Jews and tell them what was happening. It took -- fr -- from these reports, it\ntook until June ninth, the Jews of Corfu were arrested. In the German archives, even the German\ncommander of Corfu send a report to his superiors, a lengthy report in which he was trying to tell\nthem that there is no need to do anything towards the Jews, they have never bothered us.\nEvidently he -- he said, we don\u2019t have any means of transportation, why don\u2019t you arrest the --\nthe Italian soldiers of Bertolio who are -- are dangerous? Th-The Jews never bothered us. Out of\n2,000 Jews, only 187 returned from the camps. So this 1s the -- the -- the story with the -- the\nstate depart -- and the American -- American government. Now, Baruch Schibi continued his\nactivities as a -- a leader of the resistance, and he was responsible for the mili-military\nintelligence during certain battles in the [indecipherable] where hundreds of Germans are\nworking.",

She\nenrolled in the village school. I made a book for her, you know, by copying another book. I used\na little basin as a boat in one of the ponds there. She -- she never complained.",
        "A: No, no --",
        "A: -- there was only an elementary school of four years, you know. I -- and I -- actually I took all\nthe schoolbooks with me and I confess -- confess that I did not open them even once, although I\nconsider that year as the -- the most formative and important year of my life. And -- and actually\nwhen we came back from the village -- we left on October third, 1943, I came back on October\nthird or fourth of 1944. I wrote down all the memories of that year and I entitled it, \u201cOne Year in\nthe Mountains,\u201d and I gave it to my teacher of literature to see it. He kept it for six months in his\ndrawer, and he gave it back to me without making any comment. I gave it to my father. He\nlooked at it, and he made a hiding place under the -- the heavy dining room table. Why? Because\nI loved the partisans, and I loved their songs. And immediately after the war, what happened in\nGreece is this, Greece 1s the only country in Europe where those who fought the Germans lost\ntheir jobs, they -- after the war, they lost their jobs, they were imprisoned, they were exiled, or\nthey were executed. Not all of them of course, you know, but -- but -- but most of them. Maybe I\nshouldn\u2019t say most of them, but -- but a great number of -- of the resistance fighters suffered this\n-- this fate. As a matter of fact, there -- there were even some Jewish partisans who were\nexecuted, and one of them, the most important Jewish -- Greek Jewish partisans, who was an\nexpert in agriculture, Lazarus Azarias, he was a brilliant man and a highly organized person, and\nhe was in charge of supplies for the resistance. And he was so effective 1n hi -- in this job, that\nimmediately after the war the Greek government condemned him to death in abstentia because\nhe managed to escape and go to Israel, where he became eventually, the director of Nuva, which\nis one conglomerate dealing with produce.",
        "A: Yes, not ELAS, ELAS was the right wing partisans, they didn\u2019t bother them. And\n[indecipherable] my father\u2019s first cousin was a -- a doctor who was an officer in -- in ELAS, a\nmedical officer. What happened was that e -- that Churchill and Stalin divided parts of Europe in\nzones of influence. And the -- that Greece was part of the British zone of influence. So when the\nwar ended, the -- the British w-were afraid that the -- the army of -- a -- of ELAS, which had\ncommunist leaders, they were afraid that they might take over, so what they -- what they did is\nthey -- they landed troops in Greece but th-they needed allies who would be their natural allies.\nBut the former German corroborators who were in the security battalions, and the provincial\npolice which also collaborated with the Germans, and I don\u2019t know about the police in -- in -- in\nAthens because the leaders of the police were [indecipherable] and Evert are considered\nrighteous Gentiles because they issued false identity cards for many Jews. But the fact is that all\nthese groups were, including the -- especially including the German collaborators, they were the\nforce that took over in Greece, and -- and therefore, anyone who had to do -- anything to do with\nthe resistance became a -- a communist suspect, including me. What actually happened with me\nis that when I graduated from high school at the age of 17, I needed a -- a special police permit to\ngo to Athens to -- to take the entrance exams for the school, for the university. So I went to the\npolice to -- to take the -- the permit, and to my surprise, they refused it. So, I said I wanted to\nspeak to the chief of the police. I went to his office, and he was sitting there with the\n[indecipherable] who I knew he was a German collaborator, and the leader of the paramilitary\nfascist organization, X. I didn\u2019t like that, but I told the chief of the police, why don\u2019t I get the --\nthe permit? And he reminded me of the fact that I was in the mountains. I know I was in trouble\nalready and there was no need to ex -- no use to explain to them that I was a Jew, most probably\nthey knew that already. But by that time I had become streetwise, so to speak, and I remembered\nthat my high school principal had been arrested by the partisans as soon as they moved into\nAgrinion because he was -- he was an eloquent speaker, and he extolled and asked the Greek\nyouth to imitate the German youth in the fight against the evil forces of the allies. So the\npartisans put him in prison together with [indecipherable] and many, many others. And the\nBritish released them from prison. So, I also knew that I was one of his best students in his\nsubjects, Latin, ancient Greek and modern Greek. And so I told the chief of the police, I\nunderstand that you don\u2019t know anything about me. The only thing -- the only one who knows\nme 1s my high school principal, because I\u2019ve been a student up til now. Was, you know, 17. The\ntwo of them looked at each other and smiled, and the chief replied, if you bring us a paper from\nthe -- from Mr. [indecipherable] who they knew very well, you have no problem. So I went\nstraight to his house because he was sick in bed, and I told him what happened, and he became\nfurious. He immediately dictated a -- a letter to his son who was there, and he -- but this was a\nserious business. This was not, you know, just a letter, he asked him to go to the high school and\nask a specific professor to have this typed, and -- and have it stamped, and -- and return it to him\nfor his signature, and then take it to the police. And I remember that he was ending his letter of\nrecommendation by saying that I have nationalist feelings and Christian ethics, although this man\nknew perfectly well that I was a Jew. So this is my experience after the war as a -- as a man\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: My -- my father -- in the village as I show -- I told you, everything was very well organized, it\nwas -- it wa -- all the branches of the resistance were represented. My father, since he was a bank\nemployee, they asked him to be the -- in charge of ETA, which was the provisions for the\npartisans. Now, the village was extremely poor, and the provisions that my father collected were\ninsignificant, but still my father officially, he was the representative of ETA in the village. When\nwe came to Agrinion, the Germans had left enormous warehouses filled with supplies, which had\nnot been able to take with them when they were abandoning Greece. So the partisans occupied\nall these tremendous warehouses of [indecipherable]. I remember they were filled to capacity\nwith things. And they asked my father if he would like to be the director. My father was so\ngrateful to the partisans, he -- he did. So he was the director of the warehouses until the partisan\narmy was destroyed, which was maybe three -- three or four months later.",

So this third time that was the most serious out of the all three times, I\nwas feeling very happy, because this was the first time that it was not only we the Jews who had\nto leave the village and go to the top of the mountain, but everybody had to do it. So sure\nenough, the whole village was evacuated. We went to a plateau overlooking the river and the\nvillages below, and --",
        "A: In the village? Over 300.

So we better go and find -- I mean,\nactually he found a -- a good hiding place, away from the rest of the villagers. So we went with\nhim and we found ourselves in a sort of a balcony, which was covered with a -- the branches of a\ntree. A balcony with a magnificent view of the river below, and the villages of Apiscope and --\nand Psilovrahos. And I was able to see from a distance the column like -- like ants, it looked, the\nsoldiers moving. And then what happened was that the partisans attacked the Germans. And a\nferocious battle took place for almost an hour. And then, when the German artillery started\nfiring, then we knew the situation was really bad. But the partisans, when the artillery started\nfiring, they withdrew, and it became quiet again. And that was the time that the -- the little ants\nthat we saw before started -- starting at different houses and then smoke would be coming from\nthese houses. They were burning the house -- the houses of the village of Apiscope.

It -- it was a sort of a disappointment, I -- I was not as happy as I expected\nto be, especially knowing -- we didn\u2019t know what was happening to our relatives, and we were\nafraid that maybe my grandparents were too old to survive, you know, all this transportation, and\nthat, but we never expected to see what really happened.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: We -- we saw nothing, I mean, the city was the same way like it was before, and only when I\nwent to Ioannina and saw the -- there was none of the people that we were -- w-we used to -- to\nhave there, that were na -- there, only then I started wondering why all this happened. I had many\nquestions that I had in my -- my mind. Question number one would be why such a thing would\nhappen. And the -- my -- my answer was in one word, anti-Semitism. In two words would be\nreligious anti-Semitism. And I\u2019m very much -- very familiar with the -- the church teachings. I\nknow exactly what they say, especially during the -- the holy week. And if -- if you have in -- in\nthe church, young children who are exposed to the beautiful picture of Jesus Christ and then you\nlove this person, and then all of a sudden you find out that it was the Jews who -- who killed him,\nI mean, how would you feel? It\u2019s [indecipherable] like I faced that when I was in the village, and\non Good Friday we were in the church, and the -- and the priest did whatever he had to do. When\nhe came for a coffee to my parents. he apologized. And he said, I -- I\u2019m sorry I had to say so\nmany things -- because that\u2019s in Greek, we can understand, that\u2019s not in Latin. And, I\u2019m sorry I\nhad to say all these things, but you understand, that\u2019s my job. My parents, of course, they\nunderstood. And the following day I saw a little boy, maybe no more than five, who I used to be\nhis hero, and he used to follow me around all the time. And he looked at me with suspicion and\nsome sort of hate. So I told him, why, what -- what\u2019s wrong? And he said, \u201cYou killed Jesus\nChrist.\u201d And I will never forget that. That would be my question number one. The -- the second\nquestion would be when did the allies know about all this? I was under the impression that they\ndidn't know. That\u2019s the reason my mother and I were eating that vegetable pie. We -- we -- we\nwalked for 14 hours. What I found out is that the British had broken the older police code of the\nGermans as early as 1939. And this older police was the one that was in charge of the Jews.\nThere are documents which prove that they knew exactly when a German unit would say, arrest\n100 Jews in Paris, who was the leader of the group, how many men he had under his command,\nwhere did he stop on his way to -- to Auschwitz, or there were killing grounds even in -- in\nMinsk. And they -- they documented all that by simply following these radio transmissions. So\nall this -- all this was known. The -- the Americans, up til the time that Germany declared war\nagainst the United States, they had embassies and consulates all over the place. They had secret\nagents every -- everywhere. The documents -- I -- I checked only the 500 documents that were\nrelated to Greece, they knew exactly everything to the point that rather than interviewing\nsurvivors when I wanted to -- to find what was going on, I preferred to read the -- the reports of\nBurton Berry. He was a far more eloquent writer than any of these survivors. So they knew what\nwas going on. And then the third question is, why didn\u2019t they do anything? And again, the\nanswer comes in these words, religious anti-Semitism. Even in the United States, there was\ndiscrimination against the Jews in terms of employment, and the -- the real historians know now\nthat the state department not only blocked immigration, blocked information, they even tried to\ncover it up to the point that the -- that the -- that the secretary of the treasury sent a report saying\nacqul -- acquiescence of the United States to the murder of the Jews of [indecipherable]. That\u2019s\nserious stuff, ac-acquiescence. And then you have other people who, like Professor David\nWyman, who says that I, as a Christian, he says he -- he\u2019s appalled that the churches did not do\nanything and they remained silent in the United States. Let alone the Vatican, let alone all the --\nthe bishops of all Germany. So this is the -- the old story. But I have to say another thing, that\nlike I mentioned before, the Jewish contribution, the Greek je -- military Jewish contribution\nwith Colonel Frizis. And this was very important and Greece has to be very proud of that\nbecause the action of the Greek army delayed the German attack against Russia by six crucial\nweeks. The Germans were forced to fight a winter war in Russia, which was -- had disastrous\nconsequences for the Germans. So this I would say is the direct contribution of Greece, indirect\ncontribution of -- of Colonel Frizis since he was the first one who stopped the Italians and then\nadvanced as -- ahead of his troops, although he was killed later, but this was a great contribution.\nThen you have all the Jews who fought in the British forces, including I would say the son of the\nfirst president of Israel, Haim Weitzman, who was shot down over the British channel. And then\nthere were 550,000 American Jews who served in the armed forces of the United States. In other\nwords, when we asked, why didn\u2019t the allies help? I say, this is not a case of benevolence, or a\ncase of -- of charity, the Jews earned and deserved the right to be assisted. Not only that, let\u2019s not\nforget that if America became a nuclear power, which guaranteed American supremacy, it was\nbecause of Jewish men like Einstein, Oppenheimer, Ziller, Teller, Rabbe, while the relatives of\nthese Jewish men were dying in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. Personally, I\nbelieve that it was wrong, unfair, ungrateful and shameful for the United States and Great Britain\nto abandon the Jews and let them die the way they did.",
        "A: The Greek population in -- the great majority of the Jews were in Salonica, and -- in -- in\nnorthern -- northern mass -- massa -- in Macedonia and -- and [indecipherable] and northern\nGreece. The population there was far more anti-Semitic than the enlightened people of Athens.\nAnd as I said before, only one family out of 10,000 famil -- families was offered asylum. That\ntells, as far as I\u2019m concerned, plenty. Many believed that it was not easy to -- to go to the\nmountains in -- in -- in Macedonia, that the resistance was very weak in 1943. But there is a story\nthat I sent for publication to the journal of Hellenic Diaspora, and that\u2019s the story of a friend of\nmine, Dr. Joseph Struncis from Veria. And in this story you see how his father, who was the\npresident of the Jewish community of Veria, he didn\u2019t know what to do, like everybody else. He\ncontacted this -- this horrible Jewish leader, Rabbi Koretz, and he --",
        "A: He contacted Rabbi Koretz, and he tried to reassure him that everything would be alright, that\nthe Jews of Poland -- I mean, accept the deportation, the Jews of Poland has -- have houses for us\nand jobs and everything will be alright, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. But -- but he was not\nsatisfied, so he went to the chief of the police of Veria, Stavridis, and that\u2019s another righteous\nGentile that I would like to add into -- into my list of -- of the 12 or 13. And -- and he told him\nnot to listen to the rabbi, not to trust the Germans, just go to the mountains. Now, to see how\neasy it was to go to the mountains, my friend had a senile 85 year old grandmother, and they\nwere not going to leave her behind. So, they ended up w-with her on a horse and they had to\ncross a river with a raft. The raft was very small. She was on the horse, she could not see the raft.\nShe moved to the other side of the river, and for the rest of her life she was talking about how --\nabout the miracle that took place like in the time in Moses, that the waters parted, and she\npassed. And it would have been done, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s exactly the point that I want -- I -- I want to\nsay, but you had to have some Christian friends, because the Christians knew far better as to\nwhat -- what had to be done. In addition to that, it was the Christians and not the Jews who had\nfriends and trusted relatives in the remote mountains of Greece, where there were hundreds of\nvillages. Why they were in s-such inhospitable places, where they had to -- to cultivate things\nfrom terraces, because during 400 years of horrible Turkish occupation, that\u2019s where they had\ntheir freedom. And they would have sent -- who -- you see, when the leader of the communist\nparty was talking about sending them, dispensing them to -- to our side, he knew what he was\ntalking about. But the Jewish leaders wouldn\u2019t want to have anything to do with somebody like\nhim, and all -- all ri -- so were waiting to see what their -- what -- they were waiting for whom? I\nme -- believe there was Koretz who was collaborating with the Germans.",
        "A: I -- well, I would say this, he was not a bad man. His wife, Gitta Koretz send me a 48 page\nletter in which she was trying to -- to -- to justify his actions, that he was an intellectual who\nknew t -- 12 languages, who -- who had a Ph.D. in oriental studies, who could have left Salonica\nand go with the mayor of Athens, who invited him to leave and go to Egypt, and he didn't want\nto do that. It\u2019s possible that he thought that 1t was only a deportation, I -- I can\u2019t tell. But if I were\nthere, I -- and -- and I saw what the Germans were doing, especially when the Germans as-\nassembled in -- in July of 1943. They assembled 9,000 Jewish men age 15 to 45, and they\nhumiliated them, they tortured them, they -- and -- and then they started forming slave battalions\nin -- wh-which had to work under inhumane conditions. That was the time when there was free --\nI mean, it was e -- it was legal, and they were free to move, to go to the Italian zone, or go to\nthese remote mountains, provided of course, they had the proper connections with -- with the\nGreek villagers. And that\u2019s what was missing, since they did now know what was going to\nhappen. But wh-wh-why do -- should they accept deportation? I mean, isn\u2019t it better to be free?\nAnd think of all the tons of gold and precious items and supplies which were looted by the\nGermans and their collaborators. Can you imagine if all this gold and supplies would have come\nto the resistance? And let\u2019s think of how much the -- the Jews would have contributed to that\nresistance, because we had thousands of men who were experienced fighters from the war\nagainst Turkey in \u201921 and \u201922, and the war, the second World War. You have experienced\nfighters who would never surrender, because any Jewish partisan who would be captured by the\nGermans would be executed. So you would have a -- a great contribution to the allied effort.\nWhat a -- a -- a waste of -- of -- of manpower, and a-as a former military officer, I can say this, I\nremember the -- a poem by Haim Nachman Bialik, who said -- but it was related to something\nelse, but the words are very appropriate. Great -- great is the sorrow, and just as great is the\nshame. And I ask you, oh son of man, which is greater? The grandsons of the Maccabeans went\nto their death like lambs, wherever they were found. And to see what some of these grandsons of\nthe Maccabeans could do, I will tell you something about the -- perhaps the greatest partisan\nvictory of the second World War, which took place on May sixth, 1944. I said before there were\nthousands of Greek traitors who were not punished after the war. There was a group of five\nJewish families from Larisa, who established a camp on the slopes of Mount Olympus. They\nwere betrayed, and an s -- n-s -- SS battalion went one morning and captured them. Three Jewish\nmen attempted to escape, and they were killed. The f -- a fourth man was able to escape and\nnotified a nearby partisan unit of ELAS, which included Jewish fighters, like the legendary\nplatoon leader, Marko Carasso, and even a cousin of mine who was a -- a teacher of literature,\nJoseph Matsas. 150 partisans ambushed the Germans. The terrain was perfect for an ambush.\nThe battle lasted for around six hours. German planes came to help the Germans but they were\nineffective. The Jews eventually were liberated. There were 150 German dead, 78 wounded, and\n14 taken prisoners, including one who was the son of the German general of the Aegean. He sent\na message that he would release 200 hostages that he had for his son, but the message arrived too\nlate. The partisans executed the 78 wounded, and the 14 prisoners for a total of 242 German\ndead. And the Germans never again attempted to go to the mountains to capture fugitive Jews.\nPartisan losses were eight dead, and 10 wounded. I have the names of the eight dead, and I\nbelieve they should be considered as righteous Gentiles, because they could very easily have said\nwe don\u2019t want to try to save the Jews. So far, I mean, this can show you what the partisans could\nhave done.",
        "A: There was, until the end of the war, there was not even one Jew in Greece who knew anything\nabout the Holocaust or about the fact that the Germans were killing Jews. Not a single thing.\nWhy? Because the Germans had t-total secrecy. As a matter of fact, Professor Breitman mentions\nthat the Germans attempted to -- to keep this secret from -- especially the Jews, but also from the\noutside world and the German people. They were successful in deceiving the Jews, but they were\nunsuccessful in keeping it secret from the outside world or the German people. In Greece not\neven one Jew knew anything. The first time that we understood what was going on was in the\nmovies when we saw Eisenhower visiting the concentration camps. If we knew what was going\non, there are survivors who say that under no circumstances would they have entered the trains\nor the trucks. Who would do that, to -- to -- to take his -- his children, his wife, his parents, in an\norderly fashion to the trains that led them to -- to -- to the -- to the death camps. As a matter of\nfact there have been cases like I mentioned before the -- the 75 Jewish communists who returned\nto follow their families and there are two cousins of my father from Ioannina who were also on\nbusiness on the day of the arrest, and they returned to Ioannina to be with their families in exile,\nand they never came back. Nobody knew.",
        "A: Is this the --",
        "A: This is correct, but we had connections. In other words, we had the right wing friend who --\nwho told us where to go. We had the left wing friend who told us come to our house and we will\nsend you out. If we didn't have these two people, we would have, if nothing else, procrastinated.\nTwo days after we left on October third, two Germans appeared in the bank, and they asked for\nmy father. Now, if we judge as to this visit from what happened in other cities, my assumption 1s\nthat my father was going to be a hostage of the Germans, and if he were a hostage of the\nGermans, my mother would never have left him to -- a-and go to the mountains, even if we were\nallowed to do that. And -- and another thing is this, we left before the order for registration came.\nWe did not know there was going to be any order for registration. We left only because we heard\nthat the Jews of Athens went into hiding, we didn\u2019t know why. We simply -- we were simply\ndetermined not to obey any German orders, that was our only -- but we had friends. This is the --\nthe -- the problem that I -- I see with all the Jews. They did not have any friends, they didn\u2019t\nknow what to do. If you have people around the neighborhood who -- who are glad that these\nthings happen to you, and they are eag -- they are eagerly waiting to see what kind of looting\nthey are going to do, and there was extensive looting in every city where there were Jews, they\nare eager to see their competitors being demolished, how in the world do you expect any\nassistance from these people? And considering that -- that the Jews did not know that deportation\nmeant anything but deportation, and -- and having leaders who could not really lead them, and\nnot having any good advice by their friends, they were waiting. Now, once you are registered,\nthe story changes. Then what you do is dangerous if you try to leave. Of course, the friend of --\nof Veria, with the 85 year old mother, left while they were registered, and while they had the\nyellow star, and my friend said that as soon as he was in free territory, they took the star and they\nthrew it to -- to the ground. But it took much more bravery on their part to do it. That\u2019s why the\nmost important thing in Greece is that the -- the deportations started very late, in March of 1943.\nThe Jews of Poland were already dead. The Warsaw ghetto uprising was taking place at the exact\nsame moment, around March, April, 1943. Up til that time, the Jews of Greece had plenty of\ntime to disappear and dissolve, you know, in -- into eight million Greeks in a remote -- in\n[indecipherable] mountains, whereas I told you, the Germans had to mount expeditions including\n600 men, that -- that was not easy. And even if they did, where could they go the -- since there\nwere no roads, and -- and there were impenetrable forests and -- and terrib -- terrible mountains\nand -- and -- and unknown parts. Plus, there were the partisans there. So the situation in Greece\nwas great for the Jews to -- to -- to escape. In addition to that the -- the Jews would have gone to\nTurkey, because the partisan organization, the naval branch of the partisan organization called\nELAN had formed a -- in -- in agreement with the Jewish defense force Haganah, they\ntransferred some 1500 Jews from Greece to Turkey and from there to Palestine. Even the prime\nminister of Greece, George Papandreo used this method of escape from Greece. So there was this\nin addition. I believe since there were so many traitors, including six Jewish traitors, and I -- I\nwould like to -- to mention something about them, too. I mean, we were not innocent, we had six\nJewish traitors, all in collaboration with the Germans. So the -- since there were so many traitors\nin the city, so I would say the approximately 6,000 Jews of Greece who were saved, were saved\neither by going to the free partisan controlled areas, and -- or they stayed with -- in that work of\nresistance sympathizers in Athens who volunteered their services, and there are no cases where\nthe [indecipherable] for example, they w -- they were appointed to go into the house for one\nman, but the -- the -- well, 1 -- this is a case where it shows how the Italians were very helpful in\nSalonica, where they saved hundreds of Jews by giving them Italian citizenship, and they moved\nthem to -- to Athens. But in the case of the [indecipherable], what they did was they acted as if\nthey were prisoners of the Italians who were going to be judged 1n an Italian court in Athens. So\nthey were taken to the Italian zone, and then to Athens, but the Italian soldiers knew the address\nwhere the resistance told them to go. They di -- because these people did not know anybody in\nAthens. How could you go to Athens unless you know somebody? So the resistance provided a\nplace for them. So the Italian soldiers went to the house, and they said, do you know something?\nWe went to our commander, and we told him that we brung -- brought the prisoners here, but he\nsaid where are the prisoners and we couldn\u2019t produce you, so how about if you give us some\nmoney? So the SS were afraid of blackmail on the part of the Italian soldiers. They gave them\nsome money and then they notified the resistance they were to leave this house. And sure enough\nthe resistance says all right, you go to that house. Went to that house, and -- and they stayed in\nthat house until the end of the war, reading Mr. [indecipherable] all the books that he found\nthere, teaching French the grandchildren of the -- of the men, and the man was very proud\nbecause he saved, he said, a -- a British soldier, a communist and now a -- aj -- a -- a couple of\nJews. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a combination. You had to know somebody, which --what [indecipherable]\nthe poor Jews of Salonica, there was a lot of poverty in Salonica, they did not know anybody.\nBeginning Tape Three",

So I went home and I told my\nparents, this is my manuscript, I gave it to Mr. Papachristos and he gave it back to me. My father\ntook a look, he -- he saw partisan songs there, at the time that the -- everything was going bad for\nthe former partisans, so he was very handy and he made a hiding place under the -- the dining\nroom table. It remained there, we forgot about it, from 1945 til 1963 when my parents were\ngoing to come to the United States and they were getting rid of their furniture because they were\ngoing to rent the house in Athens. At that time my father didn\u2019t know what to do with this. He\nwas afraid that the Greek custom officials would see it, or the American custom officials would\nsee it, and what would they say, so he burned it without asking my permission for it. There was\nnothing there that would have disturbed neither the Greeks nor the Americans.",

        "A: This 1s in the city of Arta with my father and mother, and I might be maybe five or five and a\nhalf years old.",
        "A: My mother is Esther Matsas. Her parents were Gracia and Josef Kwen of Albania and my\nfather 1s Leon Matsas, who was born in Ioannina. It\u2019s interesting to know that my -- my mother\u2019s\nparents, my grandparents, survived in Albania, in Vergnon. Their house was the headquarters of\nthe German army in -- in Vergnon. And they lived with the Germans for the duration of the war.\nOnly on the last day that the Germans were leaving, they blew up and burned the house and the\nshops they had underneath, and they claim that this was done not because they were Jews, but\nbecause they did not have enough time to destroy their archives. Otherwise, none of the Jews of\nAlbania were -- was arrested.",
        "A: This is 1945. My mother, father, my sister Minetta, and the suit that I wear is a suit that was\ngiven to me by the Joint Distribution Committee.",
        "A: This is myself in 1948 in Athens, with my cousin Sam Mayhere, who escaped from a German\nconcentration camp in Larisa. And he was almost executed by the partisans because they thought\nthat he was a sort of a -- a anti-ELAS German collaborator. And he was saved at the last moment\nwhen a partisan approached him and he told him, \u201cNow you say that you are a Jew, so we\nChristians when we go to bed at night, we make the sign of the cross, what do you Jews do?\u201d\nAnd Sam said, \u201cWe say Shema Yisrael,\u201d and he recited it for him, and the partisan embraced him\nand he told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, nobody will execute you.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. I have to say something more about my cousin. After the war my cousin opened a -- a sh\n-- a shop where he was selling milk and cheese. A policeman owed him a lot of money. When\nmy cousin pressed him to -- what are you going to do about what you owe me, the policeman\nwrote a report saying that he was a communist. So when they drafted him in the army, they took\nhim to an island, Makronsis, where they took all former partisans to re-educate them. Part of the\nre-education was to beat them up. So they -- they -- when my cousin wen -- went there, the\ncommander of the place realized they made a mistake, that this man was not a communist, he\nwas never a partisan. They didn\u2019t understand. Maybe my cousin explained to him what\nhappened. So they told him, all right, you are not one of them. Take a bamboo stick and let\u2019s go\nto beat them up. My cousin refused, so -- so they moved him to the communications service, and\nthat\u2019s how he was able to be on leave to -- to Athens. And that\u2019s when we got this picture.",
        "A: This is in the medical complex in [indecipherable] where we were studying physiology,\npharmacology, anatomy, etcetera. And -- and this is in front of a beautiful statue of Hippocrates.\nAnd I am there with one of my classmates.",
        "A: Iam the handsome guy on the right. The -- the right as I see it this way, right?",
        "A: This is also in Agrinion with my father, mother and Minetta.",
        "A: 1950.",
        "A: This is in 1951 when I decided to make my first visit to Psilovrahos, and this is right in the\noutskirts of the village.",
        "A: And this is in -- on -- 1-it\u2019s a cave, a [indecipherable] cave where I went there escorted by a\nvillager who knew the area, and a lieutenant who was very much interested in knowing why I\nwent there, and maybe he suspected I was going to meet somebody in this cave.",
        "A: We -- well, no, no, not th -- in the end of the war. In -- in the -- during the first time that the\nGermans occupied the village, which they occupied only once, that was the time that we went to\nthe house of -- of this man and his father. And at that point we saw a line of villagers\napproaching and I thought that they were the Germans and I said, the Germans are here. And\nwhen I said that, we all ran in the forest. When the -- the father of this man saw that we were so\nafraid of the Germans, he said, well if that\u2019s the case, you -- you\u2019d better not stay in my house,\nand I will take you to the -- to a cave where you can stay during the day and come to sleep wi --\nin our house at night. And that\u2019s how we were introduced to the cave.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. And so this is the son of the -- of the man. And this is a beautiful cave with\nall kinds of stalactites, stalagmites. Actually, at that time we were not so good in ecology and this\nwas -- nobody knew about the cave, so I still have a few stalactites from -- from the cave.",
        "A: In this picture I\u2019m treating in the dental office of the military hospital of Veria. I volunteered\nto treat some orphans, and the director of the hospital allowed that, and these were my patients.",
        "A: Yes, that was -- was when I was in -- in Veria.",
        "A: In this picture I\u2019m the one on the right side with the [indecipherable]. And this is in Patras,\nand the other two men are physicians serving with me in the same unit.",
        "A: This is me in 1960. This was my graduation picture from Howard University Dental School.",
        "A: This is a 1985 picture from our visit to Greece. It has been taken in a balcony in Salonica in\nthe house of the brother of Dr. Stroumcis, and in -- on the right side of it in the picture, the\noutline of the white tower of Salonica can be seen very vaguely.\nEnd of Tape Three\nConclusion of Interview\n"
