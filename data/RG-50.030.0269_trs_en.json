        "A: Hello, Joan.",
        "Q: Can you tell me where you were born and when you were born?",
        "A: Well, I can tell you where I was born. I was born in a little village which doesn't appear on\nany map in Transylvania. And I was born some times in March, but whether it was the 11th\nor the 13th or the 15th has been subject to serious debate, and that's simply because there\nwere no records kept. Ah I would certainly have been an incubator baby but they never\nheard of an incubator. I would certainly have had a doctor there but they didn't have a\ndoctor. I would have been sent to a hospital but there was no hospital. So it's a little difficult\nfor me to be more precise.",
        "Q: And what was your name at birth?",
        "A: My name was Berell, and as a result of that I had to adopt a middle name at some time in my\ncareer, and I had known that I, knew I was known as Benny when we came to America.",
        "Q: Uh tell me what your. . .name you were born with.",
        "A: The name I was given as an infant was Berell, which was the Jewish name. But when we\ncame to America they decided that was not a suitable name, and so I was called Benny. And\nah, that time Benny Leonard was a big prizefighter name, and when I got on to school they\ndecided to change that: Benny was abbreviated, so they called me Benjamin. And then when\nI needed a middle initial and I had none, I took \"B.\" and then they had to say what did that\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So by the time I got out of law school I was Benjamin\nBerell, or Berell, Ferencz.",
        "Q: And where were you educated prior to law school?",
        "A: Well when we came as immigrants to the United States I was raised in New York. I went\nthrough the typical type of New York immigrant lower East Side beginning, and then my\nfather got a job as a janitor -- they didn't call them \"supers\" in those days -- in an apartment\nhouse in Hell's Kitchen, over on 56th Street and Tenth Avenue. And there's where my\nearliest recollections begin. From there I went to the New York school system, the public\nschools. My parents were divorced when I was six, so I went out to live with an aunt who\nlived in Brooklyn and that's where I actually started school, because I was too small and I\ncouldn't speak English, so they wouldn't take me at the school until I was seven. So I was off\nto a slow start, I was a slow starter. But my education was primarily in New York. I caught\nup with my education by going to Townsend Harris High School, which was a school for--\nwith accelerated curriculum. From there I went into City College in New York and from\nthere to Harvard Law School.",
        "Q: What did you major in at City College?",
        "A: At City College I majored in sociology. And interestingly enough, I was always interested\nin crime prevention. Maybe that related to my early recollection in a highly dense crime\narea, Hell's Kitchen. If you look at a map of crimes in the U.S., that was black because there\nwere more crimes committed there than in any place else and that may have stimulated my\ninterest 1n crime prevention, because there but for the Grace of might have gone I.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: No, I had a sister, an older sister who was eighteen months older than I.",
        "Q: And did you both live with this aunt?",
        "A: Yes. When the parents were divorced they had to find their own way and fortunately both\nremarried and they both lived happily ever after and we all lived happily ever after. My\nmother and father were related, they were cousins, second cousins who were assigned to\nmarriage at birth and it didn't work out but their subsequent marriages worked out very well\nand then we all became good friends.",
        "Q: What made you go to law school?",
        "A: I always wanted to be a lawyer. I don't know where it came from, and I don't know why,\nbecause I didn't know any lawyers but somehow I always wanted to be a lawyer and that's\nwhy I went to law school.",
        "Q: Was there any particular interest in the law?",
        "A: Yes, I was interested in crime prevention and I had no interest whatsoever in taxation. I\nthought \"I'm never going to have any money, and I'm not going to defend anybody on a tax\nmatter, I have no interest in corporate law.\" And so I was immediately involved in criminal\nlaw, and did very well. I won a scholarship on that at my first exam at Harvard, and then I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And that had an important influence on my later\ncareer.",
        "Q: When you were in college, the War had started?",
        "A: No, the War started when I was in law school. I recall the December 7th when Pearl Harbor\nI'm talking about the United States involvement in the War. The War was on in Europe, but\nthe United States involvement began when I was at Harvard. And I remember the day when\neverybody went down to--to enlist.",
        "Q: Were you conscious of National Socialism, what it was doing in Germany prior to going to\nHarvard while you in college?",
        "A: Oh yes I was, very much so, but there was then a large movement to stay out of the War\nduring the early years, an anti-War protest movement. And I think I was more inclined to be\nsympathetic to that movement than to anything else. There was a general awareness of the\npersecution of the Jews, for example, and I remember a protest rally which took place in\nMadison Square Garden -- I think my parents went down there -- to protest and call for a\nboycott against Germany for the persecution of the Jews, so we were aware of that. But it\nwas only when I got into Harvard that this Professor Gluck began to receive reports of the\natrocities in Poland, because he had been invited by what was then called the United Nations\nWar Crimes Commission, had nothing to do with the United Nations as we know it today, to\nbe the American member of that. And he funnelled all of those reports to me so I was very\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

        "Q: And these are very detailed reports?",
        "A: They were quite detailed in terms of the size of the massacres. We didn't have, you know,\nsuch details as pulling out gold teeth and making mattresses out of the hair but we knew that\nthe Jews were being rounded up and sent to camps where they were being exterminated.",
        "Q: Were you an Einsatzgruppen reports?",
        "A: No. I never heard the word \"Einsatzgruppen\" until many years later, so we didn't have the\ncharacterization of the nature or the specific units involved in the massacres.",
        "Q: When did you enlist?",
        "A: There's another story there. I assumed that I would go into the Army immediately when the\nWar broke out, and I tried to get into different branches. I first applied for military\nintelligence, I knew French, and I thought I would be helpful and I knew other languages I\nknew some Hungarian and Yiddish. But my parents hadn't been citizens for 15 years, and so\nI was disqualified. And then I tried to get into the Air Force. First, I was too short to be a\npilot, and then I tried to be a navigator and then they changed the rules they were altered a bit\nand then I reapplied and then I failed on my eyes -- missed two letters on the 20/20 line.\nAnd then I tried to take training exercises. And while all this was going on I was still in\nschool.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nTo make a long story short, I tried to get in every branch of service without success, until I\ngot out of law school. I then went back to my draft board and I was very concerned that\nsomething had happened. And the clerk of the draft board came up to see me and I told him\nI hadn't been called up. \"What's going on here?\" And he had received a letter from the Dean,\nI think 1t was Dean Landis, in the middle of my first year, saying that it would take another\nmonth or two before I finished the first year and they should give me deferment until the end\nof the year so I wouldn't have a complete disruption. They had granted that and I thought\nthen I could then go in. But they ah this member of the draft board came up to me\nafterwards and said, \"How did you do in law school?\" and I was very puzzled by that\nquestion, and he told me he had been a student at the Yale Law School in the First World\nWar. And he had been wounded and had never been able to go back to law school and his\nlife had been ruined; and he just wanted to protect me from that kind of an experience. So it\nwas a Strange fluke -- I never saw the man before and never saw him again, but he reached\nhis hand out.",

        "A: Well, I thought -- I could have stayed out of the War. In fact, one of the first doctors who\nexamined me, you know, I just about made the height requirement and I was having trouble\nwith my stomach -- I always had a nervous stomach -- and he said, \"Well, you won't qualify\"\nand I said, \"Why not?\" and he said, \"Because we can't meet your dietary needs\" and so on.\nBut I always felt that I didn't want to ask anybody else to go and die for me.

        "A: Well, the Army of course immediately recognized my talent. I was fresh out of the Harvard\nLaw School so they made me a buck private in the artillery and I was in the supply room as a\ntypist; I couldn't type, of course. And as a matter of fact, they really did recognize my talent:\nWithin 30 days they made me a Private First Class. So I figured out at that rate in 18 months\nI'd be a General. Well, of course three years later I was still a corporal. Leave it to the\nArmy. I didn't like the Army at all.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: I hated the regimentation always. I felt the Army, all armies, 1t was nothing particularly\ndirected against the American, or the German Army for that matter. I think my hatred of the\nAmerican Army may have equalled that of mine for the Germans. I didn't know the\nGermans. But it's the dehumanizing process that takes place in an Army where as part of the\ntraining the first thing you do is take human beings and make robots out of them. And I\nrefused to become a robot and that caused me endless grief in the Army because I was\nalways being reprimanded and sent on KP and I refused to march. And I said that was the\ndumbest thing I ever heard of. I explained to my first sargeant that the reason people march\nis that it went back to Roman times when the soldiers had to carry their shields on the right\nside or the left side or over their head and march in formation because they were being\nattacked by spears from the hills. And if they didn't move in formation the spears could\npenetrate, and kill them, and therefore it was very important that they moved as a unit, and I\nsaid that was very important. I said, \"If we are going to attack any Romans with spears on a\nhill then that's the way we should march. But if we are facing a guy with a machine gun, and\nyou march in formation, he'll kill you all. So what you have to do is not march in formation,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

        "Q: It didn't change you one bit.",
        "A: No, it made my resentment greater. I think I hate all armies, and I am absolutely anti-\nmilitaristic, and I think the notion of training a human being to push a button which will\nresult in killing a million people, or a hundred thousand people, and thinking nothing about\nit, is a horrendous thing to do, and incidentally that's exactly what the Germans did to the\nconcentration camp inmates. The first thing they did was dehumanize them -- shave off\ntheir hair; give them a number on their arm; lose their identity as people, and that's how you\nbreak the human spirit, and it works. But it didn't work with me.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in this...where were you assigned first?",
        "A: Well, first we went to basic training in Carolina, which is great, you know, because you\nmarch around, march all day, march up and down again, and you do all those absolutely\nridiculous things that you do. And I kept on saying \"There's a war going on, don't you, 1s\nthere nothing more important that I can do than just march up and down here, you know,\nclean out the slop pits?\" \"OK wise guy, back again into the kitchen\", you know. So it was a\nform of torture (laughs) I felt the United States Army was directing its torture at me\npersonally, and it was a terrible time, and I had applied for officers candidate school.

And when we were getting ready to go overseas my first\nsargent called me in and said \"You want to be an officer, here's your application.\" He tore it\nup in my face and threw it in the trash can. And my commanding officers felt the same way.\nI tried every means to get out of that outfit. I applied for the infantry, for the paratroopers,\nfor everybody. And they called me in and threatened to court-martial me for showing\ndisrespect for the outfit I was in and warned me that I would only go out in a box. So, I was\nin the wrong outfit.",
        "Q: What then happened?",
        "A: Well, we went...we were being trained for the invasion of France and we didn't know then\nbut for wherever the landing would take place. And there was 115th Triple A Gun Battallion\nof which I was a proud private or corporal at the time. Eventually they promoted me to\ncorporal, and there was the 116th and again when...we weren't on the first wave, but were\nsupposed to go in very soon to shoot down any of the high-flying aircraft. The barrage\nballoons would have taken care of the low flying aircraft, and when D-Day came around and\nI was at the Land's End in England waiting for the invasion, my outfit went over. It was a\ncouple of days after D-Day when they had enough beach landed to justify it, and my\nCaptain, who was a new captain on that job, came and he said \"you stay here\" and again it\nwas one of those times when somebody reached out and I was left and off they went and it\nwas several days later, or a week or so later, before I went across and rejoined my outfit. By\nthat time the Germans had retreated from the beach, and I was perched on top of a hill and\nmanning a machine gun to make sure we didn't get any attack from the rear, but from there\non in it was just chasing the Germans all across Germany.

If the Germans had counter-attacked we had no way of repelling\nthem, but they didn't, so off we went. And then of course I was with that outfit all across\nFrance and Luxembourg and Belgium and I found out when I was finally discharged I had\nbeen in five campaigns and it was every campaign in Europe. From the Battle of the\nBeaches of Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge. But it wasn't necessary for me to be\nshooting people through the head during that time.",
        "Q: So you didn't shoot.",
        "A: No. I mean the outfit was pursuing. We were fired upon. And I was under artillery fire very\nfrequently and tank fire, but we did shoot down a lot of planes, usually American planes.\nWe didn't call it friendly fire then, which was a nice euphemism we invented later. But the\nplanes that were coming in, American planes, they had a gadget called identification friend\nor foe which was supposed to give off a signal telling us that they were American planes,\nand either the had forgotten the signal or the equipment was off or the plane had been\ndamaged. In any case, we shot them down, and I had to go out on several occasions to pick\nup pieces of American flyers and hope that I could find a fingerprint or a bit of a finger to\nidentify them, and the fireworks, of anti-aircraft fire, may look very nice on Fourth-of-July,\nbut I don't go to Fourth-of-July celebrations.

        "Q: Ben, did it make a difference that you were a Jewish soldier?",
        "A: Certainly it made a difference. I was in an outfit which was commanded by antisemites.\nMost of the, or many of the people, let me say, in the Army were carryovers from the First\nWorld War, or people who couldn't get a job in civilian life, and a lot of rednecks, and very\nfrequently I was referred to as \"Jew Boy\" and when I was given some of the dirtiest\nassignments I was told \"You're a Harvard man, Jew Boy, do it again\", you know, and they\nput me through it again and again sweeping the floor, and it was never clean enough, no\nmatter what. And they just thought that was great, and they absolutely resented any effort of\nmine to get out of the outfit or to become an officer or anything of that kind. So there was a\nlot of antagonism between me and the military.",
        "Q: Was this typical?",
        "A: I think it was...well I can't really talk about typical of other outfits, it was very typical of this\noutfit, yes, for a long time.

And then I arrived at 3rd Army Headquarters and the\nJudge Advocate section. I had never seen a Judge Advocate officer before, and I was told\nthat I had been recommended for transfer from Washington, and that the unit had been\ninstructed to set-up a War Crimes Branch in the U.S. Army. And the Colonel who told me\nthat said \"Your name has been given to us, and what's a war crime?\" And that was literally\ntrue. He had no idea what was meant by a war crime. A nice enough Colonel, but he had no\nsuch experience, and I said, \"Sit down Colonel, you're about to get an education.\" And he\nsat down and I explained to him, because by that time I was quite an authority on war\ncrimes. I had done all the research for a book by this Harvard professor Gluck, and I had\nread everything that had been written about War Crimes, the First World War and way back,\nand my job was to make summaries of everything that had been written, all the articles, all\nthe books, and I had a very retentive mind and I knew everything about war crimes.

        "Q: And then what did you do?",
        "A: Well, the typical early investigation would be we had a report, for example, of American\nflyers, parachuters, who had come down and been killed by the populace down below. And\nwe'd received such a report from some informer or somebody in the field and had come\nthrough military intelligence down to the War Crimes unit, and what I would do then was I'd\nget into a Jeep, and take off for the location, and very often by myself, or I'd have a Jeep\ndriver and I'd arrive at the site and go to the nearest authority whether its a Biirgermeister\u2019 or\na police chief or, and say that we have a report of war crimes being committed here, and \"Do\nyou know anything about this?\" Of course, \"I know nothing about it.\" \"Sit down and write\nout an affidavit.

I\nwould say \"Get somebody who knows English and German and you, you're the translator.\nYou explain to these people, they would arrest maybe fifty or seventy-five people and say all\nof them sit-down and write out exactly what happened. Anybody who lies will be shot.\"\nAnd they would stand at attention and tremble and sit down and write. And separately, you\nknow, keep them all apart. Then I'd collect the statement and say, \"Now read 'em to me.\"\nAnd they would read them to me, and pretty soon if you read seventy-five statements you get\nforty of them telling you the same thing. The others saying \"I wasn't there\" \"I never heard of\nanything\" \"I happened to be milking the cow at that moment,\" and so on. But with the forty\nstatements you knew what had happened. So what I could write, you know, on this and this\ndate an Allied plane was shot down, two American flyers were captured, brought to the\nmiddle of the town, there they were beaten by the populace or they were taken to the\nGestapo headquarters and it varied, there were many such cases and then I would go to the\nGestapo headquarters to see if I could catch the man that had invariably fled, but I'd capture\nthe records and find out who was in charge. Then I would go try find the bodies, and dig\nthem up, and sometimes I dug them up myself, sometimes I'd call the graves registration and\nhave them send in a crew or sometimes I'd stop the Germans and say to start digging, and I'd\nunearth the bodies, call in a camera crew, the Signal Corps, take pictures, wash them down,\ntry to identify them and then write a report and issue an arrest order to all units to arrest So-\nand-So and So-and-So. By that time prisoners of war were being captured and being\nidentified and hold them for war crimes trials. So, that kind of an investigation I could do by\nmyself. And I did.

The first\nwar crimes trials, long before Nuremberg, took place in the Dachau concentration camp, on\nthe basis of the evidence collected by me and Nowitz and a few other guys like us who went\nout into the field and collected the evidence. That's before we ran into the concentration\ncamps, of course, that was a bigger operation.",
        "Q: How many trials did you have there prior to the Military Tribunals?",
        "A: I don't know the exact number because I left. The trials were already on while I was there,\nbut I left and they were still going on when I came back a long time later, a year or so later,\nand was prosecuting at Nuremberg. Those trials were still going on. To give you some idea\nof the flavor of those trials which I thought were terrible, I thought they were terrible: They\nbore very little resemblance to a normal due process of law and I must confess that I was\npartly guilty and responsible for that kind of behavior. I mean, I, if I had an SS man in my\ncustody and he insisted upon lying that he wasn't even there when I had twenty witnesses\nsaying he was there, he usually ended up with a confession. It was not that I had to shoot him\nthrough the head in order to get it, but he certainly was of the impression that if he continued\nlying I would. And under those circumstances I would always bring in an officer and tell\nhim to go and get that confession again, because the one, the original one, would probably\nnot stand up to close scrutiny. But the trials themselves at Dachau were, the judges were\nofficers with no legal training, usually, who had no better assignment. The procedures were\nvery informal. I'm not suggesting that we tried and punished innocent people: on the\ncontrary, they were all guilty as hell, otherwise you wouldn't have tried them in the first\nplace. You had too many guilty ones let loose, but, so I was not very impressed with the\nquality of the law work being done at Dachau, on the contrary, in some of my letters that I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

There were also some massacres of civilians in different towns, mass graves, things\nof that kind. But nothing near like the concentration camps themselves.",
        "Q: Before we get onto that, were you frightened when you went out out to investigate?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren't afraid?",
        "A: No. I was mad. I don't recall ever having any sense of fear. There was some sense of\noutrage. It was not a sense of vengeance. That was not one of my emotions. But I was quite\ndetermined and it was a job that, you know, I realized had to be done and I was so engrossed\nin getting the job done that there was no time for fear nor was there any real fear. I mean, I, I\ndon't know that emotion.\nQ. Did you actually have authority to go into a place and say \"I'm arresting you, you seventy-\nfive\" or was this something you made up on the spot so you could get what you wanted?",
        "A: Well, according to my rank, I had no authority whatsoever, and I was aware of that, but I had\nmore authority than anybody else because nobody else knew or cared what I was doing and\nin order to give myself that authority I had written out a an authorization request from the\nCommanding General who was Patton saying that all units are requested to give all\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And using that I could go into a Colonel and say \"Look here, I am\nhere on a war crimes investigation and I want you to send me a company of troops to\nsurround this area or to hold this area closed or sealed\" or whatever, whatever it was I\nneeded to do. Now sometimes the Colonel would say \"Oh no --\" I said \"Listen, you want\nme to call up Patton directly? If you do, I will. And he'll straighten you out!\" And I had no\nrespect whatsoever for military authority. I had nothing but contempt. The higher the rank,\nthe more contempt! And it invariably worked very well. So that I had no difficulty, in ah\nbecause I wore no insignia of any kind and I refused to wear insignia. When my Lieutenant\nColonel was promoted to full Colonel in recognition of his splended work for war crimes, he\ncalled me in with great pride and he said \"You know,\" he said, \"I realize this is done, you\nknow, as a result of your efforts and to show you my appreciation I want to give you these\nstripes\" and he made me a sargeant. So I took the stripes and I threw them right into his trash\ncan and I said \"I am sorry, sir, but these stripes only interfere with my work. I cannot go\naround as a sargeant and do what I'm doing because I cannot command the authority that I\nneed to do the job. So you'll excuse me if don't wear them.\" And he was of course very\ninsulted by that and I think the final act that he did before he was transferred out before I\nthink Colonel Bill Denson came in, was he left instructions to have me reduced to a private.",
        "Q: You were a Colonel?",
        "A: I was in a...that was my Colonel, he was going to make me a sargent with three stripes, but I\ncouln't do my job as a sargeant either and so I refused to wear the stripes, and all of my war\npictures you'll never find any insignia on me.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "Q: Was this, was this your real reason for not wanting the stripes because of the fact that you\ncouldn't do your job?",
        "A: Oh yes, absolutely, absolutely. I...It goes back to your first question: what authority did I\nhave? A private, a corporal, a sargeant has no authority in the Army to do any of this, but\nthe job had to be done and so I got the job done, and I didn't pay any attention to the absence\nof military rank about which I cared not one bit.

A report would come in to 3rd Army\nheadquarters that so-and-so tank division is approaching an area in which they believe there\nis a concentration camp or has just overrun an area in which there is a concentration camp,\nand the conditions are horrible, et cetera, and that would come to me, the report would come\nto me, and I'd say I am going out into the field to investigate that. Later on we had others\nwho would go out into the field, but I was very eager to go out, and because I was the most\nexperienced man in the outfit and nobody else knew what to do, in fact, I would go out. And\ngoing out meant I'd get there as fast I possibly could, usually on a Jeep, find out which unit\nwas going in or had just entered, and go on into the camp. And what I would do immediately\nwould be to secure the records. There was in every camp a Schreibstube, or an office. I'd go\ninto the Schreibstube and immediatly beschlagnahm\u2019 the Schreibstube which means you'd\nseize, I'd seize the Schreibstube and everything in 1t. Nobody could in, nobody out. All\nrecords are confiscated and secured. For example, in Buchenwald, I siezed the Totenbiicher,\nthe death books, which were the registries of the people killed in Buchenwald. There were\nlong big black books, bound, there were not the loose leaf folders, but there they recorded\nthe name of all the inmates as they were killed, and they would put down next to them the\ndate, the name, the date of birth, usually, if they had it of the inmate, and his number, of\ncourse, then the reason for his death, and they were all so obviously fictitious. \"Auf der\nFlucht erschossen\" -- \"shot while trying to escape\" or \"Typhus\" -- \"typhoid\" or other\ndiseases. Those books then became the basic evidence for what had happened in the camp\nand who was there. Then I would follow that up by bringing in witnesses from the survivors\nto take statements from them describing what had happened in the camp. And by the time I\ngot through it usually took two or three days and not usually more I had a complete picture.\nOn the basis of that I could go back to headquarters, write a report and issue arrest warrants\nThe rolown onan: sik chlagne hmeny to seize or The fiscate. is the primary source document, not this transcript.

        "Q: Ben, let's talk again about Buchenwald. You said there was a prisoner there who had been\nburying some material that you wanted to talk about.",
        "A: I'm not sure it was Buchenwald, in fact. I should perhaps mention that I was moving very\nquickly from one camp to the next. As soon as I secured the evidence in a camp and I heard\nthere was another camp someplace else, I raced off to the other camp because if you did't do\nthat, everything was destroyed. The American Army, for one, would come in and destroy\neverything they could, and the inmates themelves tore everything apart. So I was moving\nfrom one camp to another -- Buchenwald: I didn't remember the name Buchenwald at the\ntime. I remember Ohrdruf because we took pictures at Ohrdruf and these additional slave\nlabor camps all around the main camps -- there were many of them. So I would go from one\ncamp to the next -- Ebensee, Mauthausen, Flossenburg, Ohrdruf, these are names that I recall\nand that come to mind. Sometimes I knew it at the time, usually I didn't, I jut knew it was a\nconcentration camp. And in one of those camps -- it may have been Buchenwald but I don't\nthink so, it was probably Ebensee or Flossenbirg, or it wasn't Mauthausen, it was too big --\none of the inmates in the Schreibstube came to me as soon as I came in and he said, \"I have\nbeen waiting for you\" and I said, \"What for?\" He said, \"Come with me\" and he took a\nshovel and he took me out of the room, which was their office, and we walked away into the\ncamp next to the electric fence which was part of the surrounding barbed wire, and there he\ndug a hole; I remember it was right near the post of the fence. And he dug a hole with the\nshovel and took out a bundle. It was a box wrapped in what looked like rags. And he said,\n\"Let's go back to the office.\" I went back to the office and he opened this. Well, apparently\nin that particular camp, the SS had their own sort of social club where they went for drinking\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

When the stamps were filled on that club, on that card, he got another card,\nand this inmate had to type up a new one and destroy the old one. Instead of destroying the\nold ones, he saved them. Now every time he did that he ran the risk of being killed for\ndisobeying orders. But he saved them and he put them all together and he buried them,\nknowing that one day there would be a day of retribution. And for him to have risked his life\nevery day and yet retained the hope that there would be freedom for him some day, I thought\nit was a marvelous thing, and it was tremendous piece of evidence, because I had the record\nand the photograph and identification of every SS man who'd gone through that camp in that\nperiod of time.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to into these camps? What did you see?",
        "A: Well, I'm sure that everbody by this time has seen the photographs of what the camp looked\nlike and bodies lying in the dust, naked, a little item of clothing on, many of them not\nmoving, some of them stirring, mostly bones; human beings, men weighing fifty, sixty\npounds. The medical troops came in at the same time, people were being hosed down with\nthe hose held up with one hand and I've done that too -- hose them with the hose held in one\nhand and hold up a man in the other hand who weighs about 40 or 50 pounds and is nothing\nbut bones. And then of course the piles of bodies in front of the crematoria stacked up like\ncordwood, and on the on the carts that were dragging them to the crematoria, these open\ncarts just loaded with bodies, hands and arms hanging out on all sides.

And these were human beings who had been dehumanized by this\nterrible process to which they had been subjected. And I always marvelled in later years\nwhen I'd meet people whom I didn't recognize, of course, but I knew they'd been through that\nand they seemed to be quite normal. I knew that the couldn't be quite normal but if you\ntouch some spark, you know some spot, the crack shows. But this whole process of what\nhappened to human beings struck me as more terrible than people who were on the verge of\ndeath or who were dying out of starvation or disease and so on. In other camps like\nMauthausen -- I remember Mauthausen very vividly, because it was a very big camp and I\ngot in very early, and it was a terrible Vernichtungslager\u2019, really, where they were killing\npeople by throwing them off the cliff into the quarry down below. Gusen I and Gusen IP and\nof course the mass graves everywhere. And I, there was typhus in the camp and I couldn't\nspend the night there, I had to get out of the camp as fast as I could, I did my work and got\nout, I wouldn't spend the night there; and dysentery, people lying around in their own filth\nand excrement; you know one on top of the other, in the bunks you know, one on top of the\nother -- three, four, five in a bunk, maybe somebody above, and everybody sick, you know\nthrowing up, blowing at both ends; and the stench and the disease and the despair --\nsomebody holding up a hand for a glass of water or a drink, or something like that. So, it's\nreally quite unimaginable to a normal mind. And that people could subject other people to\nthat kind of treatment is something I will never recover from.

        "A: Not to get away from the scene. The work was so overwhelming that I never faltered in the\njob, I never felt that I had to stop because I couldn't carry on. I carried on very well, and it\nwas though I just built a wall to cut it out, you know, and just to go ahead and do what had to\nbe done and don't let it impact on your emotional response to it. So I left the camps because\nconditions were such that it was dangerous to stay but only after I'd done what I had to do.",

        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, there were many of them who were, and in fact that's where I used...those\nwere ones from whom I collected statements immediately. You know, some of them were in\nfairly good shape and they were in such good shape that they went chasing after the SS. I\ndescribed in one of my letters a scene of an SS man trying to escape being murdered by the\nprisoners who were chasing him, and he wanted me to take him prisoner. And he had a\ncivilian jacket on, he put the civilian jacket on in an attempt to escape and he jumped on the\njeep and said, \"Please take me prisoner.\" I don't remember any more if he was speaking\nGerman or English, any more, probably German. I said, \"Show me your papers,\" and he\nshowed me his papers, and I could see he was an SS man. I said, \"These are not your\npapers.\" They were not his; they were some other papers he'd picked up somewhere. I said,\n\"I don't take civilian prisoners\" and pushed him off.

There were troops moving up to the front -- trucks and so on --and just as he ran in\nfront of the Jeep, one of the men, the inmates shot him in the back and he fell in front of this\ntruck, which hit him and sent him flying to the side of the road. And the truck driver,\njumped out, a GI, and he said, \"I don't know what happened, he jumped in front of the\ntruck.\" And I just said, \"Keep on moving soldier. Get on.\" You know, and I rolled him into\nthe ditch. So there was an upsurge of the inmates themselves on a rampage. As soon as\nthose gates were opened, they went on a rampage and any German who was within reach,\nrued the day, you know they stripped their homes, they raped their women, they burned the\nhouses down you know. So there were many who were quite capable of still working and\nthinking and talking, and those who seemed to be knowledgeable and better educated, I tried\nto catch them immediately and have them give me a statement you know, what had\nhappened, where they came from, describe who was in the camp, what the circumstances\nwere, describing some of the torture mechanisms which existed in some of these camps --\nchains, and walls against which they shot people, and people were thrown on the wires and\nall that.

And there were little children who were born\nin the camp and were somehow concealed by the mothers in different places and, you know,\nin these slave labor camps surrounding -- there was a whole network right outside the main\ncamp.

I took witness statements from ten witnesses, they are\nattached as Exhibits One to Ten. The suspected persons responsible for these crimes are so-\nand-so and so-and-so. Issue orders immediately to have them put on the CROWCASS list,\nthe Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects. Have them distributed to all\nmembers of the U.S. Army wherever any POWs are, compare them with this list, have them\narrested, and report back to headquarters.\" So, the goal of my investigation was to describe\nwhat had happened, to collect credible evidence admissible 1n a court of law, which could be\nused to convict the persons responsible of a known crime under international law. That was\nthe objective, and that's what we did. And there were very few of us doing that. Nowitz was\none, I was one, and later we got a few more people in, but the total number was never more\nthan half a dozen or a dozen, who were competent to know what represented a war crime\nand to prepare a report which would stand up in a court of law. That then became the basic\nmaterials for the prosecution to come in and say to the defendant, \"Your name 1s listed in so-\nand-so, so-and-so said so-and-so, what do you have to say?\" And that's the way it went.",
        "Q: So you folks are the war crimes teams.",
        "A: We're the war crimes team. We're the war crimes team. There were a few officers around as\ndecoration, because only officers could take a sworn statement. So when you had the sworn\nstatement you sent it to the officer and said \"you sign there\" and he said, \"What's that for?\"\nand you'd say, \"That's an affidavit.\" \"That's an affidavit? What's an affidavit?\" \"That's an\naffidavit, it's a sworn statement, you sign right here.\" \"Yessir.\" \"OK. \"Lieutenant so-and so\"\nor\" Captain so-and-so.\" And that was it, and that was the evidence of war crimes.

        "Q: Do you have any other memories about seeing the inmates in the camps that you'd like to\ntalk about?",
        "A: Well, there are so many memories it's hard to know where to begin, but one thing that comes\nto mind which struck me particularly at the ttme was the May First, the May Day celebration\nin one of the concentration camps, I think it was Ebensee\u00ae, where the inmates were\ncelebrating their liberation and the May Day. It was organized by the Communists who\nwere in charge of most of the camps immediately after liberation. They were the best\norganized. There was a big tribune with Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill and there were\ngoing to be big speeches, but first there was going to be a parade of the inmates and they\nwere broken down in national groups. The Russians marched with a red banner, and the\nFrench and the Italians and the Yugoslavs and the Romanians and the Hungarians. And then\nthere was a group marching along, a bedraggled group, and they had no flag. And I asked\none of the inmates, \"Who are they?\" And they said, \"Oh, those are the Jews.\" I said, \"Why\ndon't they march with you?\" And he said, \"No, no, the Jews, they're separate, that's not us,\nthose are the Jews.\" So there was the antisemitism still in the camp after liberation as a\nreflection, you know, of the ethnic hostility which we see today in many parts of the world\nstill. And another event which strikes me as perhaps noteworthy is that as the camps were\nabout to be liberated, the Germans tried to move the inmates out, those who were still able to\nwalk or to work. They left those behind to be killed or to die who were too sick. But they\nmarched them out, and they were marching I think it was from Flossenbiirg to march to\nDachau or one of the camps. They took them through the woods and they marched at night,\nThe rolowind subeamne et met ha a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I was able to follow this trail\nthrough the woods of mass graves -- 10, 20, 30, 50 killed, you know. And I would get the\nnearest farmer to say, \"Dig them up.\" They would say, \"Oh yes, we heard firing there last\nnight, there was shooting going on,\" \"Where was it?\" \"Over there in the woods.\" And I\nwould say, \"Let's go\" and we would go out into the woods and there would be a newly dug-\nup place and I'd say, \"get some shovels\" and I'd stop some Germans on the street, \"take these\nshovels, dig 'em up\" and we'd dig up the bodies of people who'd obviously been shot through\nthe head; usually the top of the skull blown off, shot probably kneeling from the back, some\nof them were tied still; just lightly covered over with six inches of dirt, something like that.\nSo I could follow the trail of crime being committed all along the way. There was nothing\nyou could do, I mean we were trying to overtake the column; which by that time they'd\nalready been liberated up ahead and some other unit had taken over. And one of the\ndifficulties, I remember as an American soldier, to resist the temptation to try to feed some of\nthese people. We all carried emergency rations of chocolate bars, which were like a brick:\nyou know we carried it in our gunbelt, in case you got into a jam you could hit it with a\nbayonet and break off a piece and survive that way. But if we gave it to an inmate it was\nliable to kill them; and it happened, a lot of the GIs were giving away whatever they had. I\nonce had a can, a case of sardines I'd liberated somewhere and gave it out to the inmates; that\nwas my first reminder I mustn't do that because it would kill them, if they ate a can of\nsardines it would kill 'em. You had to begin by feeding them soup for a week, begin with a\nvery light soup until their stomachs and systems were built up. So, you know, it's hard for\nme, where do I draw the line? I remember the Ebensee concentration camp, I'm quite sure it\nwas Ebensee, too; there were mass bodies everywhere and we had to bury them right away\nbecause of the disease. And we buried them outside the camp in slit trenches. We had\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

A few years later I came back with one of my employees, Dr. Katzerstein, who\nbecame a key man in one of the organizations set up to help Nazi victims. And his wife\ndidn't know why we were in Germany and I said, \"I'll show you why\" and I took them on a\ntour of some of these camps. And we got to Ebensee and there they were all neatly marked\ngraves with crosses on them, you know, and I said, \"That's a lot of baloney because I know, I\nwas here when they were being buried and have pictures of me walking past this so-called\ncemetery.\" Well, they found names of inmates who had died in the camp and just put a\nmarker on, which I suppose is all they could do. But, it was a nightmarish world and there's\nsomething very surrealistic about it and bears very little reality to what the normal human\nbeing would understand, even.",
        "Q: Do you consider the liberation of the camps really \"liberation\" or was this accidental coming\nupon what you were doing?",
        "A: No, no, it was real liberation, that was not the primary goal. The troops were moving\nforward and they stumbled upon many of these camps, they didn't know they were there. In\nsome cases the Intelligence had reports, and I had a map, a war map showing camps at\ndifferent sites of the major camps, so they knew we were there and we would move for them\nand I could tell we were probably going to hit that camp in four or five days and get ready\nfor it. But what we didn't know was all these subcamps that were scattered all around.\nThere were hundreds of them! Everywhere! There were hundreds of them! I have a list\nhere of over a thousand concentration camps run by Germans and German industry, and the\nGermans themselves didn't know! We added another three or four hundred later, I don't\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

So these so-called small camps which may\nhave had a couple of hundred people in them, they existed everywhere, and they were all so\nsimilar. People were dying, they were killed, they were lying around, you couldn't tell the\ndead from the living.",
        "Q: Did you, in terms of the feeding of the prisoners, were you told to not feed the prisoners or\ndid you just learn this by --",
        "A: We learned it, we learned it. I mean, there was no time to sit down and have big briefings. It\nwas a very, very mobile and hectic atmosphere of you know tension and movement and\ndrama. But you soon learned that if you gave somebody some food and you saw them choke\non it and drop dead, you know, that you didn't do that again. So it was not -- I never recall\nanybody giving a lecture about that but 1t was pretty well known in the camps, the medical\nmen that came in began with intravenous feeding with just water and tea and a little soup,\nand that was it. So we saw you know what was going on.",
        "Q: How would you describe your mental state, going through these camps? You were blocking\nyourself to feeling anything?",
        "A: It was very interesting as I look back upon it. I think the human body has a capacity for\nsurvival which enables it to build up insulation, insulating mechanisms to prevent yourself\nfrom going mad. And I do not recall feelings of rage. I do not recall feelings of fear. I do\nnot recall feelings of hatred. I do recall the urgency of doing something and getting the job\ndone before it's too late. So I went about my business as best I could -- and I did it, I think,\nvery well -- by putting myself into a mental cocoon which was surrounded by an ice barrier\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And that little ice barrier lasted until it melted, you know,\nbut as long as it was necessary to do the job it remained there, as a self-protective device, I\nthink.",
        "Q: Okay. Now you've gathered all of this material and the War Crimes teams have a lot of this\nevidence. Now what's going to happen?",
        "A: Now the higher headquarters have got to decide what to do about war crimes trials. The\nPresident has declared we're going to have war crimes trials. Hitler and his henchmen had\nbeen put on notice that they'll be held accountable for the concentration camps and whatever\nelse they did. The governments had to act. They were not yet ready to act, the War had just\nended. The Army already had these records, we were all ready, we had the prisoners, we\nhad to do something with them. And in 3rd Army...there was a 12th Army Corps group\nheadquarters, in Wiesbaden I think, they wanted me to come and work with them, I\nremember that; I got a letter from the General asking me if I wanted to be transferred to his\nheadquarters -- it may have been Colonel Denson\u201d who dealt with that, and I said, \"Listen: I\ndon't want to do his work any more than I want to do yours, I want to get out of the Army,\nthat's all I want. I want to go home.\" But I recall, having nailed up the sign \"Headquarters\nThird U.S. Army, War Crimes Dachau,\" we decided we were going to have the trials in\nDachau. Now Dachau was liberated by the 7th, not the 3rd, Army, but we were occupying,\nGeneral Patton was there, and that was the site where we were going to have trials. So we\ntook these Army officers who'd been assigned to the Judge Advocate section not because\nthey were lawyers but because they were at liberty and we needed staff and they had nobody\nThe rotlowing iam Dowd ep nso Oe Anny The ane of the War Crimes tials at Dachau. transcript.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nelse; and they were going to set up tribunals. These were in fact military tribunals. They're\nnot to be confused with what happened later at the International Military Tribunal at\nNuremberg, which was an international court. These were military-style tribunals which\nhave existed under the laws of war for a very long time and they were staffed by military\nofficers similar to a court martial, it followed the court martial procedure. So they would\nhave three officers, a colonel, a major or a captain, whatever; the highest-ranking was the\npresiding officer, the prosecutors were selected by the Judge Advocate group and they may\nor may not have been lawyers, sometimes they were, sometimes they weren't, they were a\nlieutenant assigned to defend So-and-So or to prosecute So-and-So as they would a soldier\nwho had gone AWOL. Then we had all these nice reports prepared by me, Nowitz, by a few\nother guys, Slotnick (ph) was another lawyer who came on board, and we had a fellow\nnamed Briggs who was a lawyer went up to Boston; these were enlisted men and they did all\nthe work. And they had these reports, and based on those reports we would draw up the\nindictment. I would draw up the indictment. And the indictment would say that SS Major\nSo-and-So is indicted for mass murder of so many concentration camp inmates at such-and-\nsuch camp during such-and-such period when he was in command. And the evidence is:\nphotographs obtained by the Signal Corps, statements from the survivors, my own affidavit\nor other affidavits from witnesses who were there -- usually not my own, I would certify as\nto the procedures whereby these affidavits were obtained. And on the basis of that, the\ndefendant would be asked, \"How do you plead?\" And they'd say \"I plead not guilty;\" all\nright, let's proceed with the trial. And they proceeded with the trial. And some of these were\nquite interesting. For example: if you're telling stories: I arrested a woman in the town of\nGrossgerau (ph) which is near Frankfurt. It was a typical Allied flyer case. The typical\nAllied flyer is that any Allied flyer coming down under orders from Hitler was to be killed as\na war criminal; he was to be taken into custody and killed, that was the orders from Berlin.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nAnd so this Allied flyer came down in this town and the townspeople immediately set upon\nhim and began to beat him up. Eventually he was taken by I think it was a fireman or an SS\nman and they split his head with a crowbar and killed him. I knew who that was and and I\ngot a hold of him, too. But anyway, one of these women was beating this guy on the head\nwith a shoe and I think it was her mother who testified against her. She said, \"I told my\ndaughter not to do that.\" I said, \"What's your daughter's name?\" \"Her name is So-and-So.\"\n\"Where is your daughter now?\" \"The daughter is So-and-So\" and I got a hold of the\ndaughter and I said, \"You were beating those fliers with a shoe.\" \"Who, me? Not me.\"\n\"Don't tell me not you, Lady, because I know it was you. It was your red shoe -- you've got a\nred shoe? You beat him on the head with a red shoe, with the heel of the red shoe.\" \"Yeah,\nwell, that's true but you know, it had just been bombed, my town, I lost my children, my\nhusband was killed\" -- she gives me big sob story, some of which may have been true. And\nshe was quite an attractive woman too, and a young woman, and I thought, well look, I got\nthe guy who split his head and the whole mob was beating him up; I put her under house\narrest, I didn't want to bother with, you know, interring her. When that trial came up at\nDachau, I happened to be there, and one of the guys said, \"You handled the Grossgerau case,\ndidn't you.\" I said \"Yes.\" \"Well, we've got the trial on.\" \"Well, I'll go over and take a look.\"\nAnd sure enough, I spot this lady there and I spot the guy who did the job. At a certain point\nin the trial-- this trial did't last long, it lasted a day or two and that was it -- this woman\nfainted in the dock. A doctor went up and I said to the doctor, \"I know that woman, what's\nwrong with her?\" He said, \"Nothing to worry about,\" he said, \"She's just pregnant, with an\nAmerican soldier, one of the prison guards.\" Now, there's the story. Was she trying to avoid\nthe death penalty by getting herself impregnated? Was she in love with an American GI or\nwith the GI attached to her? I think she got about 18 months prison sentence or something\nlike that. The guy who split his head was sentenced to death. I don't know whether he was\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And those trials\ncame to an end while we were at Nuremberg, because I kept an eye on them, sort of. I think\nthere was a Col. Tomlinson who went down from Nuremberg to be one of the colonels in\nthose trials, and they got orders from the Pentagon [that] we're ending War Crimes trials and\nso the presiding judge said \"The War Crimes trials are over, everybody go home\" and the\ntrials were over and the criminals got up and walked out of the dock. And that was the end\nof that. So that's how you deal with war crimes.",
        "Q: So there were thousands of indictments that you --",
        "A: Well, we didn't draw up thousands of indictments; there were certainly many thousands of\ncriminals; that there were. There were very few indictments, and fewer trials and few of\nwhich had any significance. These were based on military pattern of military trials against\nAmerican soldiers for violating the rules of the military code in one way or another. That\nwas the closest analogy to it. They had no significance in international law, they had no\npolitical significance, really. We had hopes, all of us who were involved in the early days,\nhad hoped that 1t would be more than that, but by the time I left the Army, which was before\nI went back to Nuremberg, it was quite obvious to me that these trials were not to be given\nany historical significance at all; had best be forgotten. But they are an early record of what\nhappened in the camps which were liberated by the Americans. Our goal there was to try\nonly those commanding officers in the camps which had been liberated by the American\nArmy or those who had committed crimes against American soldiers. And this is why we\ngot into all these Allied flyer cases and things of that kind.",

        "A: No, it wasn't a mistake, because any time you bring anybody to justice even if it's an\ninadequate court, it's better than not bringing them to justice at all. Now, we could have\nfollowed the Russian pattern and just shot them. I never really favored that -- I may have felt\nthat way but I never favored that as a principle, as a lawyer it seemed to me it's not\nsomething we ought to do. You may be interested to know the British favored that, and the\nRussians certainly not only favored it, they did it. And there was quick justice -- sometimes\njust, sometimes unjust, I'm sure they killed people who were undeserving, but if you adopt a\ntheory that any person who sails on a pirate ship must expect to hang from the yardarm, there\nwas a form of rough justice. And I'm not sure that the detailed justice in the so-called\nmilitary commissions or courts or whatever we called them at the time, was any better in the\nlong run than allowing a rampage, as the Russians did, and cutting it off.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: I got out of the Army. Great day of my life! I was so eager to get away from Germany I\nnever wanted to hear the name \"German\" again or \"Germany\" again or \"camps\" again or\n\"Army\" of any kind again. And home I went. I was home for a few weeks and I got a\ntelegram asking me to come to Washington. \"Dear Sir: Please, at our expense, would you\nkindly come to Washington and we would like to talk to you.\" Signed by a Colonel Mickey\nMarcus. Mickey Marcus later became quite renowned as a Jewish general, a West Pointer,\nwho went to fight in the Israeli Army, and unfortunately he was killed there, but he was\nrecruiting for the War Crimes Trials, which were then being set up at Nuremberg. He had\nsomehow gotten wind of what I had been doing at Dachau and I was one of the few people\nwho was qualified by legal training to understand war crimes and by experience in the field\nas an active war crimes investigator who was also involved in setting up the trials. So his job\n--Colonel Marcus's job -- was to recruit staff for -- originally he wanted me to go back to\nDachau trials but he was working out of the Pentagon and I went to see him. I had never met\nhim before and he said, \"Benny, we want you to go back to Germany.\" I said, \"Sir, you want\nme to go back to Germany?\" He said, \"Yes! We need guys like you. You understand those\nbastards and, you know, you're going to go back there and, you know, we need you.\" I said,\n\"In order to get me into the Army to go back to Germany, you have to declare war on\nGermany again and be losing.\" I said, \"Otherwise, I don't go back into the Army no how.\"\nSo he said, \"Look, you can't do this, we need you now desperately.\" All these years they\ndidn't need ne at all. He said, \"You know the field and, you know, you've got the right\nattitude, you've got the right experience and so on.\" And he said: \"You name your terms.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

This is my chance!\" I said, \"I'll let you know.\" So I went out and I\ntelephoned to the young lady, Gertrude, who'd been waiting patiently for ten years, and I\nsaid, \"Gertrude, how would you like to go to Europe for a honeymoon?\" She said, \"Oh, this\nis so sudden.\" I explained the situation and she said it would be great. I said, \"I'm going to\ntake the job for six months. We're going to go back and we're going to have a honeymoon,\nand I'm just going to stick it to all these lieutenant colonels who've been sticking it to me all\nthese years.\" So I go back to Marcus and say, \"I'll take the job for six months as a civilian\nwith the rank of a full colonel.\" He said, \"You've got a deal.\" \"OK, draw up the papers.\"\nThen I got intercepted by a call from -- also then a colonel -- Telford Taylor'\u2019, would I come\nand talk to him. He said, \"Look: I'm going back to Nuremberg, I've been over there, the\nInternational Military Tribunal is already in process, Justice Jackson'\u2019 is there, we're\nwinding up that trial but I'm going to take over after him and we're going to set up a whole\nseries of subsequent trials.

I said, \"Marcus, I'm\noff that Army junket, I'm going out with Telford Taylor.\" And so I did -- still intending to\nhave nothing but a good time and enjoy myself and get even with the U.S. Army. Well, it\nturned out that Telford was an excellent lawyer, and he was much engrossed in the whole\nproblem of who do you try when you've tried these two leading Germans when you have the\nentire hierarchy of German life also responsible?? The ministries, the industrialists, the\ngenerals, the SS people, the doctors, the lawyers -- all of them conspired together to make it\npossible for Hitler to do what he was doing. And Telford's approach was we have to reach\nout into all these segments of German society in order to demonstrate how it really worked.\nAnd it was quite fascinating and I really took the work quite seriously, and I said, \"All right.\"\nHe said, \"What do you want me to do? Where do I begin? Where do I go??\" I said, \"We've\ngot to get the evidence.\" I said, \"I'll go to Berlin, that's where all the evidence is.\" So he\nsaid, \"You go to Berlin, set up an office in Berlin.\" So I went to Berlin; my wife I had to\nleave behind. There I set up the officer of Chief of Counsel for War Crimes, Berlin Branch.\nAnd to show you how things worked and how my Army training stood me in good stead: the\nfirst office to which they assigned me was in the cellar of a building -- it was Harnack Haus,\na famous house in Berlin -- and on the floor I found a picture of President Truman, it was\nlying 1n the dirt, no frame. So I got somebody, I said, \"Get me a picture frame.\" So I got it, I\nput the picture in, and I wrote on it, \"To my friend Benny, from Harry\" and I put it on the\nwall. Now, you know, I have a friend named Harry Friedman, he could have given me that\npicture. Then I called up the commanding colonel of Berlin and said, \"I'd like to talk to you,\nColonel, how soon can you get over here to my office?\" He said, \"Who is this calling?\" I\nsaid, \"This is Mr. Ferencz, I'm here on assignment from the President of the United States to\ncarry on a war crimes commmission on behalf of the United States Government and my\noffice 1s in Harnack Haus, I want you to come over right away.\" \"Yes, sir.\" OK, he came\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Look at this, we have\nfive or six rotten rooms here, in a cellar, we need proper quarters. How are we going to get\nour job done?\" He looks at the picture of Truman on the wall and says, \"Yes sir, yes sir\" and\nimmediately got a whole building--a half of a building right next to General Clay's\nheadquarters'*. And of course then we brought in staff, and we had a staff of about 50\npeople. What we did, we scoured all of the German archives. Most of the staff were\nGerman-speaking, former refugees, many of them Jewish who had fled Hitler, who knew the\nGerman scene, and we had the German Foreign Office archives, we had eight or nine million\nNazi Party records in a bunker under a little chateau in Dahlem in the woods; and underneath\nwere these tremendous Nazi Party files and the SS was there, the Gestapo was there, and so\non. So we sent this crew out to scour these for incriminating evidence and outlined exactly\nwhat evidence we were looking for -- murder, crime, devastation without military necessity,\nrape, burning, destruction, racial; you know, we didn't use the word \"genocide\" in those days\nbut, they were already trained. I was briefed and filled out a form which they had to fill out\nwhat all the documents what related to the crime we were trying to prove. Because two\nthings were necessary -- and this is important, and the public doesn't know it: In order to\nhave a successful war crimes prosecution, you need one, evidence beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that specific known crimes have been committed; two, you need the defendants. If\nyou haven't got both together at the same time, you've got nothing. And to bring the two\ntogether was was not easy. You had the evidence but you didn't have the man, he was in\nArgentina somewhere; you had the man, you didn't have the evidence. You knew he was\nguilty as hell but you didn't have the evidence; you knew it from his position, you didn't have\nit. But this crew, which my wife shortly joined -- she came over with the first shipload of\n'* General Lucius Clay, U.S. Army.

And we were under great time pressure, which is often forgotten -- we had to\ndo this on a limited budget, with a fixed period of time, because the political scene was\nchanging and we wanted to get these trials over with. The prosecutors were like me or even\nworse, because I knew very little about Germany, well, I didn't even know the language\nproperly at the time. And the others who came in, from Mississippi, Arkansas, wherever,\nthey had...some hadn't the foggiest idea where Germany was! They were sent because they\nhad a Senator friend who wanted to get rid of him, or get him a job or whatever it was. So\nwe had a very mixed crew of prosecutors to decide who was to be tried and on the basis of\nwhich evidence. So this process began between Berlin, primarily, and Nuremberg, of\ncoordination between the two, and it was in that context that this plane was flying back and\nforth and we had to parachute out of one of them with Telford Taylor and his wife and so on\n-- but that's another story. And also we sent out crews to various parts of Vienna, wherever\nthe Nazis were, and information came in; and Justice Jackson had collected a tremendous\namount of information in Paris from captured Nazi archives. So our job was to sort out this\ntremendous...by tremendous, I mean all the German records -- and the Germans are terrific at\nrecords, they keep everything in a hundred copies, except the secret ones [which] they\ndestroyed; the Einsatzgruppen reports, we only found one copy. And to put all this together,\nand understand them, and see how it fits in; and this to be done by a group of inexperienced\nyoung American lawyers who knew really very little of anything of what really happened.\nSo that's the job that we had, and therefore we went about that.",

        "A: The time between -- we opened the Berlin branch and the time the first trial went on I don't\nremember specifically now but I would guess we had three months? Something like that\nbefore the first, the first was the Doctors Trial; three or four months, something like that.\nAnd ready to go to trial and submit all the evidence to the accused. Let me say a word about\nthe fairness of the Nuremberg Trials, because there's been a lot of misunderstanding about\nthat. Justice Jackson dealt with it, the International Military Tribunal, which was the court\nwith the Russians, and the French, and the British and the Americans also dealt with it. It's\ntrue: 1t was a trial of the victors only against the vanquished only; we didn't try Americans at\nNuremberg. And that has subjected us to, I think, justified criticism. But the reason for the\ncriticism is that such trials are tainted and it's very difficult to have a fair trial. We tried very\nhard, and I think succeeded, 1n overcoming that taint by being very careful to make sure that\nthe Trials were absolutely fair, and they were. Now, you've heard my criticism of the Army\ntrials as a joke. The Nuremberg Trials were not a joke, nor were they \"unfair trials.\" They\nwere absolutely fair trials. I wrote an article in the American Journal of Criminal Law and\nCriminology on the fairness of the Nuremberg Trials. And as clear evidence that it was fair,\nwe gave the defendants all the evidence which we intended to use against them at least 30\ndays before trial. The courtroom was open to the public, including the German public,\neverything was recorded in English and in German, the records were available to anybody\nwho wanted to read them; the judgments were read in open court; the defendants were all\nrepresented by counsel of their own choice, which very often was excellent former Nazi\nlawyers. They had the kind of a trial which, as Jackson said, they in the days of their pomp\nand power never gave to any man. So although the Nuremberg Trial had to take a step\nforward in some directions to develop international criminal law, and although they were\ntrials by the victors, and although some of the victors themselves came with dirty hands,\nnevertheless there was no excuse for the accused. The fact that a member of the jury was\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

So the trials were very\nfair trials, and my experience with those trials, as I think a person can be objective about it, is\nthat they were the biggest advance in international criminal law that had ever been taken to\nthat time.",
        "Q: You sat and watched the Nuremberg Trials?",
        "A: I sat...well, I was in Berlin working, collecting the evidence and running the office. It was a\nbig office with a lot of things going on. There was...the Einsatzgruppen records, for example,\nwere found in the burnt-out Gestapo headquarters in the basement. One copy out of a\nhundred mimeographed copies at that time were recounting chronologically the murders in\nall the towns by these special extermination squads -- you cannot even translate the words\n\"Emsatzgruppen,\" you had to have staff to do that, to organize them and to and make sure we\nhad a trial. In fact, we were not scheduling an Einsatzgruppen trial; we had trials against the\nhigh command, we had trials against some SS officers, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt but we\nhadn't planned an Einsatzgruppen trial. One of my researchers came in with these Leitz\nfolders, three or four of them, with all these daily reports from the front: how many Jews\nthey'd killed in which towns, and the reports would read, you know, \"Today we entered the\ntown of So-and-So. Within the first 24 hours we succeeded in eliminating\" -- they never,\nalways used euphemisms -- \"in eliminating 14,312 Jews, 127 Communist officials, 816\nGypsies\" and they would list them, you know. And they sent that off to Berlin. They were\nthen consolidated from all these units in the field and issue, as a report, an issue to all the\nhighest echelons of German government, those who said they'd never heard of it and didn't\nknow -- the Foreign Office, the Finance Ministry, all the ministries were getting copies of\nthese reports. Anyway, this researcher found this and he came in and gave it to me. I looked\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He had to decide on what was going to be tried. And he said, \"This 1s\nterrific, where can we use it?\" I said, \"Well, look, it's enough for a separate trial by itself.\nLook, here we've got the names of all the commanding officers. There were 3,000 men there,\nwe have four big commandos, Einsatzgruppen A, B, C, D and each one with ten or twelve\ndifferent units under them.\" He said, \"We don't have staff any more for that.\" I said,\n\"You've got to make staff.\" He said, \"Well, maybe we can pull somebody off from\nsomebody else.\" I said, \"Well, whom have you got? Somebody's got to do it.\" He said,\n\"Well, could you do it?\" I said, \"Sure I could do it. Why can't I do it?\" \"Well, you've got\nyour other job, you've got to do it in addition to your other job.\" I said, \"I'll do them, I've got\nit all lined up.\" He said, \"If you want it you've got it.\" So I became then the chief\nprosecutor for the United States in what the United Press called \"the biggest murder trial in\nhistory\" -- 22 defendants convicted of murdering over a million people, mostly Jews. I was\n27. So that's how the War Crimes trials were planned. Let me add another interesting point.\nThere were 22 defendants. There were 3,000 German officers and men who were engaged\nfor at least a period of two years in doing nothing else but killing Jews and others who were\nperceived to be enemies of the Reich. We tried 22. And the reason we tried 22 was because\nwe only had 22 seats in the dock. If we'd had 21, we'd have tried 21. We knew it was only\na small sampling of those responsible for mass murder on a daily basis. But that's all that we\ncould do under the circumstances, and our option was to do notbing or to do that much. And\nwe did, and we established the record. We did not punish all the guilty. Those 22 were\nconvicted, 13 of them were sentenced to death by Judge Michael Musmanno\u2019\u201d of the\n\u2018Michael Musmanno was the Presiding Judge at the Nuremberg Trial of U.S. vs. Ohlendorf (The\nEinsatzgruppen Trial).

        "Q: Ben, how did you prepare these cases, let\u2019s talk about it.",
        "A: You know, I had a \u2014a problem. I had the documentary evidence chronicling specifically\nwhich units killed how many people, what types of people, in which towns. I had very little staff.\nI was the chief prosecutor, I had three assistants. The defendants, 22 defendants were entitled to\nhave one or two defense lawyers of their choice; the best Nazis money could buy, and they were\nvery good. I decided that I was going to prosecute the case, without calling a single witness. And\nthe reason I did that was because the documentary evidence spoke for itself; it was absolutely\nreliable. It was their reports from the front. At that time, I could have had available a thousand\nwitnesses, any one of whom would have come in and sworn under oath that that particular\ndefendant murdered his mother, his father, his children, and that he witnessed it. I would have no\ntrouble whatsoever. Not that they would all be lying, but that\u2019s the way they felt. And the DP\ncamps were all around me in Nuremberg, they were all \u2014 Munich, everywhere, there were DP\ncamps. And I was in and out of the camps and \u2014 and I decided I wasn\u2019t going to do that, because\nthey would not be telling the truth, they would not be credible witnesses. Their own emotions\nwould be such that their memory would be distorted, and their testimony would be vulnerable.\nSo I decided to go to trial on the documents alone. Never had happened at Nuremberg. And I\ngave the defendants all of my records, these hor \u2014 reports 30 days before trial, and I said, prepare\nyour defense. When I opened the trial, immediately of course, they challenged the validity of the\ndocuments. Oh, they are fake, they are forgeries, the Russians have fabricated them.

He was put\non the stand to testify that he\u2019d been responsible, they\u2019d been put in a sack, locked \u2014 put under\nlock and key and he\u2019d guarded them all the time, and where they were found, and how they were\nfound, identification so and so. Very soon it was clear they were not going to get away with that\nexcuse. And after three days, I rested my case. These are the defendants, that\u2019s the man\nOhlendorf, that\u2019s his report, dated such and such, which says we killed 90,000 Jews as of this\ntime. There\u2019s the defendant, that\u2019s the charge. They killed 90,000 Jews, and so reported on this\nand this date. I don\u2019t need any more evidence, that\u2019s it. And I went down the list. In three days I\nrested the case. No trial at Nuremberg \u2014 anywhere, had been done with such speed, and such\neconomy of means as General Clay or somebody else said to me. Then the fun began. You never\nsaw such a pack of lies as these guys brought out. If the report said, on July 12\", 1941,\nEinsatzkommando 10-A, of which I was the commanding officer, killed 3,412 people \u2014 Jews, the\ncommander said, well you know that\u2019s with my kommando, but on that day, I happened to be at\nmy grandmother\u2019s funeral in Berlin. And I show you, here 1s a report from the funeral parlor,\nfrom 46 witnesses who saw me there, including the mayor, including the general, including so\nand so. And when I got back, what did I discover? I don\u2019t know what the yu \u2014 nobody would tell\nme what had happened. And here I hear for the first time that Jews were being killed. Can you\nimagine something like that? Jews were being killed by my outfit, when I wasn\u2019t there. I was\nappalled. You know, and they came with excuses. Guys who for years have been every day\nkilling Jews had the gall to come and say I hear it for the first time, that Jews were killed, you\nknow? And right down the list.

Nine months, they came in with all this baloney.\nAnd the judge, Michael Musmanno, much to my unhappiness, I would say, said, whatever\nevidence they want to submit in their defense 1s admissible. He passed what he called the\npenguin rule. Up to and including the sex life of a penguin, it\u2019s admissible. And I was furious\nbecause the rules of evidence, you know, these guys were lying. Well, I wasn\u2019t going to take\nthat. So I called in our investigative division, as we were going along and I said, look, these are\nthe defendants, this is their home address, this is what we know about them. I want you to go to\ntheir homes, begin on the roof, the chimney. Tear that house apart until you\u2019ve dug up the floor\nof the basement, and bring me all the evidence that you have; every letter, everything that\u2019s been\nwritten. Another crew, you start screening all that information. I want to know what did he write\nhome, where was he at the different times. And sure enough, I\u2019d find letters. When he was\nsupposed to be at his grandmother\u2019s funeral, he never had a grandmother, she died 50 years\nbefore, I checked that out, too. That he wrote home to his wife saying, oh Gerta, did we have a\nday today, I was swimming in Jewish blood, you know. And all the rest of it, all the rebuttal, and\nI had that for rebuttal. Then I went on with the rebuttal. You were at your grandmother\u2019s\nfuneral? Well, here we are, what was the name of your grandmother. Grandmother so and so.\nWhen was she born? Well, I don\u2019t know exactly. When did she die? Well, she died on that day. I\n\u2014 she died on that day? That the same Gerta Koteso(ph) that died 12 years before? Said, do you\nhave two grandmothers by that name, you know. And what about the let \u2014 this your handwriting?\nDid you write this letter to your wife, etcetera.

Therefore, it was\nnecessary to kill them. But I always insisted that my men do it in a humane way. If I saw they\nwere enjoying the work, I took them off the job. And I instructed them, if a woman had an infant\nchild, let her keep the infant, because they could then fire into the child and kill the woman at the\nsame time, which saved ammunition. That was a much easier way of dealing with it. So you see,\nhe was really an idealist and a humanitarian. And I went down \u2014 in his way \u2014 and I went down to\nthe death house and I said, al \u2014 Herr Ohlendorf \u2014 I didn\u2019t call him by his general rank \u2014 I said, is\nthere anything you\u2019d like to tell me?

So I don\u2019t want to paint a whole\nnation, a whole people with one brush, but it was so widespread. And in my trial one of them had\n\u2014 one of the defendants, fellow by the name of Klingelhoffer(ph), he had the decency to try to\ncommit suicide \u2014 unsuccessfully, unfortunately. But \u2014 and he didn\u2019t ask for clemency at the end,\nthey left him there til the end. And he was the only one who really showed any sense of\ncontrition, for which I admired him, at least to that extent. But the others, I hear it for the first\ntime, I don\u2019t believe it, just happened. You\u2019re persecuting me, what else could I do? You know?\nSuperior orders.

        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the fairness issue for a moment. Who paid for the defense attorneys?",
        "A: The defense attorneys were paid for by the United States, out of occupation funds, I must\nadmit. But it was all expenses were paid. The guest house, as we call the place where the defense\ncouncil had their offices, and witnesses were kept, were excellent accommodations under the\ncircumstances at the time. They were fed, they got cartons of cigarettes, which was in great\ndemand at the time. All of this at no expense whatsoever to the defendants. The defendants were\ngiven every possible right of trial, and the presumption of complete innocence, and they had to\nbe found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. So they were absolutely fair trials. If I ever commit\nany crimes, I hope I get the same kind of fairness.",
        "Q: So the subsequent trials were \u2014 were conducted under the same rules of procedure as the\nNuremberg trials?",
        "A: The Nuremberg judges had no rules of procedure when they began. The charter of the\ninternational military tribunal defined the crimes, and the jurisdiction of the court, but left it to\nthe court themselves to lay down their rules. But since the judges were all distinguished jurists,\nthe British presiding judge, for example, they knew the rules of evidence, they knew what was a\nfair trial. And they had to merge different judicial systems; the French system, for example, is\nquite different from the American and the British. The Russian is also quite different. So, it was\nnecessary for them to come up with rules of fairness, which they did. They did very well. And at\nNuremberg we had the benefit of their rulings to guide us, and in addition we developed our own\nrules as we went along, all of which were then si \u2014 published in a big volume, volume 15 of the\ngreen series, by the United States government.

And the fact that the rules\ndidn\u2019t exist in advance, didn\u2019t mean that the decisions were unfair to the defendants. I felt they\nwere unfair to the prosecution. But after all, the defendant is a guy on trial, so I didn\u2019t really\nmind it too much, although I was most annoyed.

        "Q: Ben, I wanted to ask you something about what seems to be a controversy over the nature of\nthe three indictment categories: Crimes Against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes Against\nHumanity. Can you comment on what became emphasized and what became de-emphasized\nat these trials, and why?",
        "A: It's not so much a matter of emphasizing one against the other. The first category that you\nmention, Crimes Against Peace, or otherwise known as Aggression, that has been perceived\nfor a long time as being, as the Tribunal said in this case in the IMT\u201d trial, the greatest of all\ncrimes because it encompasses all the other crimes. When you commmit a Crime Against\nPeace, an act of aggression, the war that follows invariably involves killing large numbers of\npeople and the rape and the devastation and the destruction and every crime that you can\nimagine take place in a war. So, commmitting a war of aggression is the most serious crime\nthat any head of state can commit. This was known after the First World War. And efforts\nwere made at that time to bring the Kaiser to trial for aggression against little Belgium, for\nexample. And this was hotly debated by international lawyers. The Kaiser himself had fled\nto the town of Doorn in Holland where he was known as \"the Woodchopper of Doorn\" -- the\nDutch refused to extradite him because there was no precedent for trying a head of state for\nthe crime of aggression. And the international lawyers who were dealing with it, including\nthe American and Japanese, who were then on our side, felt that -- well, all right, in order not\nto have retroactive justice, they will not try him for the crime of aggression, because it had\nnever been declared to be an international crime. They would charge him, in the Treaty of\nVersailles, of \"crimes against the dictates of human conscience,\" which had been referred to\n'* The International Military Tribunal.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nin the Hague Agreements of 1899. But that wasn't good enough, because a head of state had\nnever been tried. So the Dutch still refused to turn him over and he never was put on trial.\nHowever, when we got to Nuremberg, Justice Jackson, who was a first-class jurist, said,\n\"Look, the time has come for the law to take a step forward.\" The principle of non-\nretroactive activity is a principle of equity, you don't charge a person of a crime when he\ndidn't know it was a crime at the time it was commmitted. However, did not Hitler know\nthat invading a state... a friendly neighboring state is a crime? Did not everybody in the\nworld know that? So to declare that a crime does not violate any equitable principle,\nparticularly in the light of all the precedents that we have. We had the Hague Agreements in\n1898, of 1907, we had the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928 saying that war is outlawed. These\npacts all had loopholes written into them, and then Jackson was certainly aware of that, but\nhe said, \"Look, the time has come and there's nothing unfair about trying these guys for the\ncrime against peace, of committing aggressive war, even though \u2018aggression\u2019 was not\ndefined.\" And Jackson dealt with that in his opening statement -- he said, Look: aggression\nhas not yet been defined in legal terms but whatever it was, this is it, I know an elephant\nwhen I see one. So he was deliberately takiing the law a step forward to do...to keep up with\nthe common sense of mankind. And it was based upon the long tradition which had already\nbeen established that the medieval notion of warfare, where the king goes out and kills,\ndoesn't apply in modern times. So that was the first and the most important principle out of\nthe Nuremberg Charter. Incidentally, all of these principles were then affirmed unanimously\nby the United Nations General Assembly, and they were also affirmed by the Tribunal which\nexamined the thing, and I will tell you in connection with the Crimes Against Humanity,\nthey interpreted it in a very restricted way. The second one was the Crimes Against\nHumanity. That connotation had never existed before and the theory behind it was: when\ncrimes reach a certain magnitude, they shock the conscience of humankind. They are crime\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nnot merely against the state, which happens if somebody murders somebody in New York,\nit's the State of New York against so-and-so defendant. But it's a crime against all of\nhumanity, and therefore humanity as the injured party has the right to be the plaintiff and can\nbring the charges for that crime. That also was a step forward, but it was not an unfair step\nforward, it was a necessary step forward if you were going to have a civilized international\nsociety. And in medieval notions, which were perfectly okay perhaps when a king lived\nbehind a castle wall, didn't apply. So Crimes Against Humanity was another step forward.\nThe third category, War Crimes, that was a cinch: the Hague Agreements of 1899 had\ndefined what's permissible in warfare, what's not, any violation and devastation beyond the\nneeds of military necessity, rape, plunder, poison gas -- things of that kind -- these were well\nestablished crimes, they presented no problem. Now there was a restriction put on by the\nInternational Military Tribunal. The Tribunal itself, in reviewing its own jurisdiction, said,\nLook: we have the right as international lawyers of great repute -- they were key people from\nall the countries -- to examine the Charter and see whether the Charter is an exercise in\ncreating new law or whether it is a legal instrument which we are bound by. They said it's a\nlegal instrument we are bound by because it enunciates principles which would be binding,\nand which are, binding law. But, they said, because of the wording of the statute -- and it was\nan accident, really, for someone put a semicolon in, I won't go into the detail -- in order for\nthere to be a Crime Against Humanity, it must also be linked with one of the other crimes,\nCrimes Against Peace. And that meant that the killing of large numbers of people without a\nwar would not be a Crime Against Humanity, would not be within the jurisdiction of the\nCourt. And that's what they held. Some of us who'd been involved were shocked at that\ninterpretation. We said, \"That's wrong! We didn't have that in mind. You mean to tell me\nthat Hitler kills all his Jews and he's not at war with anybody else, that is not a punishable\noffense?\" That's what the Tribunal said: under this Charter we cannot act. So we changed\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

We changed that very specifically by a Control Counsel law -- the governing agency of\nall of Germany at that time was the Control Counsel consisting of the four Powers -- Soviet\nUnion, France, the U.S., and the --which did I leave out? -- the U.K. And this Control\nCounsel enacted Control Counsel Law No. 10 which corrected that and said very\nspecifically: Crimes Against Humanity are not linked to any other crimes, and that meant\nthat if you killed your own nationals and the crimes were of such magnitude that they\nshocked the conscience -- that was not more clearly defined -- then it becomes a Crime\nAgainst Humanity, which is a different international criminal offense. And that was then\nconfirmed in the Einsatzgruppen case while I was pushing on that one and in one other case\nin the subsequent trials. So that today, despite the confusion which exists among many\ninternational lawyers who write big books on the subject, the fact is that it is the legal right of\nnations to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity, and I think it is a legal duty on their\npart to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity. And that has tremendous consequence\nfor the development of peaceful and law-abiding international society. Quick lecture. Sorry.",
        "Q: Can you talk some about the review of all of these cases, and what happened to the\nsentences?",
        "A: Yes. Let me again clarify what has been a frequent misunderstanding. I'm not talking now\nabout the Army Trials at Dachau. When the Trials were declared to be over by the Pentagon\nbecause they didn't want to budget, everybody went home and all was forgiven, and that was\nthe end of that. Those who were still in prison, I don't remember if they served; some of them\ndid serve the sentence and some of them were hanged after that. But I mean the trials\nthemselves ended. The subsequent proceedings, under the direction of General Telford\nTaylor, and there were 12 such trials, had to be reviewed, first by General Clay, who\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

There were about\n15 or 16 death sentences pending; over 13 came out of my Einsatzgruppen Trial. When John\nMcCloy came in as High Commissioner to replace General Clay, General Clay apologized to\nhim for not having gotten rid of this nasty business, because there was an appeal pending\nbefore the Supreme Court, they couldn't act until that was settled. The appeal was rejected\nby the Supreme Court of the United States and the lot fell to McCloy. McCloy had been the\nAssistant Secretary of War during World War II. He was a very distinguished establishment\nlawyer from New York, originally been from Philadelphia, and he knew nothing, really,\nabout the specifics of the trials or of those particular accused; he was familiar with the\noverall trials and in fact supported them in the Department of the Army when he was\nAssistant Secretary of War. So he had his legal department study all of these records. And\nhe did something else: he appointed a three-member panel, a Clemency Board, to review the\ncases and make recommendations as to what should be done. The principal officer was\nJudge Peck of New York, who I think is Jewish. There was one man from the State\nDepartment, and there was one who was a professional penalogist. their instructions were to\ngo over these files. Their specific instructions, which is not generally known but which I\ndug out later -- they were secret at the time -- said: \"You are not to review the correctness of\nthe decisions in any case. That has already been determined and 1s binding. The only thing\nyou are to reexamine are the personal circumstances of each defendant, such as his health,\nhis family condition, or differences in the severity of sentences for the same crime. So that if\none got off easy, one got 20 years, another got 10 years for the same crime, you would\nrecognize that as being inequitable and make a recommendation to bring that one into line.\"\nIt was not, I repeat not, a pardon committee, they had no jurisdiction whatsosever, on the\ncontrary, to challenge the validity of any of the decisions of the Tribunals of Nuremberg in\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The Peck Panels, as they came to be called, sat down and\nthen had to go over some of these files. I happened to be in Nuremberg at the time,\nrunning the restitution programs, beginning to set them up. I wrote to the Peck panel, I\nwrote to Peck and the others, and I said, \"Look, gentlemen, I know you're here with a very\ndifficult job\" -- I was executive counsel then for Telford Taylor for all the trials but there was\nanother additional job I took on, and I said, \"I'm thoroughly familiar with all of the trials and\nshould you require any information or any assistance in any way, I'm at your service.\" They\nwrote back in a letter which will go to the National Archives, which I just recently\nuncovered, saying \"Thank you very much but no thanks, we're only going to hear from the\nattorneys for the defendants. We don't want to hear from any attorneys for the prosecution.\"\nSurprised me at the time, and annoyed me at the time I must say. And so the Peck Panel\nmet, they had a few meetings together in Munich, a lovely city, they could travel all around\nsouthern Bavaria, to Austria from there, and they did, spent the summer that way, and then\nthey made their recommendations to Mr. McCloy. And he then, together with General\nHandy'\u201d who was dealing with the military -- some of the leftovers of the Dachau Trials --\nthey issued a Clemency Report which I will give to the Holocaust Museum, which I'm sure\nyou'll find in the archives, in which they confirmed three or four of the death sentences,\ncommuted the rest, usually to life imprisonment, lowered the sentences on some defendants.\nThe only defendant against whom there had been a judgment of forfeiture of all his assets\nwas the multi-billionaire Alfred Krupp. They gave him back all of his assets; and that was\nthat. That evoked a tremendous outcry of protest -- from the Nazi victims and from the\nJewish organizations and from General Telford Taylor. As a result, Mr. McCloy has not\nbeen in the good graces of either the Nazi victims or the Jewish organizations. Now, I feel --\n'\u00b0 General Thomas Handy, U.S. Army.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nI have given the documentation to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, or will -- that Mr.\nMcCloy got a bum rap, that he was unfairly judged. He was criticized, including in a book\nby William Manchester called, The Arms of Krupp, which attacked Mr. McCloy in a very\nharsh way, I think, for having released Mr. Krupp from prison and having given him back\nhis very sizable fortune. McCloy was condemned as having done this as an act of political\nexpediency in order to woo the Germans back into the Allied camp so they could be rearmed\nand help fight against the Russians, the Soviets. I am absolutely convinced that was not Mr.\nMcCloy's motive, and the reason I am convinced of that is simple. I'm a man who looks\nthrough the documents, and before I talked to McCloy about it I looked at the documents. I\nfound his instructions to the Clemency Board and I found with great difficulty the Clemency\nBoard's recommendations, which were secret. And in the instructions I have indicated the\ninstructions were \"You are not to challenge these verdicts, we are not reviewing the validity\nof these sentences or of these judgments. We are only taking into account humanitarian\nconsiderations which may be applicable.\" Then when the Clemency Board recommended\nreduction of sentences for various people, McCloy checked all those recommendations and\nin many cases McCloy was more harsh than the Clemency Board had been. I drew up a\ntable, which I gave to my friend Telford Taylor, who was then my law partner, had been for\nmany years, and I said, \"Look here, if this man is trying to do something as an act of political\nexpediency, all he has to do is to accept the Clemency Board's recommendations, they're\nindependent people, or he can accept the German arguments that death penalties have been\noutlawed in Germany under the constitution and are no longer applicable, or accept the pleas\nof the various German peace groups and the religious groups and the anti-Nazi groups who\nwere beseeching again, and Mrs. McCloy was, too: \"Please don't hang these people.\"\nInstead of that, he ordered four of them to be hanged, which he didn't have to do, and he\nincreased the sentences on several others. A man was determined to win the favor of\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And I am convinced that\nhis motivation was humanitarian, it was sincere. I know, from having seen him very\nfrequently during that period, that he was torn by emotion at having to go over this, he had\nnever caused anybody to be hanged before, and it was not an easy thing for him. And so the\nharsh criticism that he was merely wooing the Germans at the expense of the Jews is a\nmistake. I know also the help he gave us in connection with Jewish restitution and the\nstatements that he made to the Germans, and the pressure he put on the Germans to see that\nthey paid more than they wanted to pay.",
        "Q: Why do you think he received such a rap? Just because people have not investigated him?",
        "A: Well, it's easy to criticize him, it fits into a pre-set pattern, you know -- that the Americans\nare wooing the Germans in order to get them to fight the Russians. That's the Manchester\npattern and it should be examined in that light and many people share that view, but it's a\npolitical opinion not based on fact. And McCloy has also been criticized for not bombing\nthe rail lines at Auschwitz, and I discussed that with him at some length long after the event.\nI did not intrude on him in what I recognized to be a personal decision that he alone had to\nmake about the life and death of other people. I felt that was something which should not be\nthe result of political pressure. And when I discussed with him the bombing of the rail lines,\nI said, \"Look: you realize that the Jewish community is in an uproar because of your failure\nto do that. What was going through your mind?\" He said, \"It was very simple. First of all,\nthe British, who are antisemitic, didn't want to, because they didn't want to divert their\nbombers from winning the war, which they perceived to be the primary goal. And we had to\nuse British bombers for that kind of an operation because we divided our responsibilities into\nsuch-and-such-and-such.

And\nthere were also strategic reasons. First of all, you'd have to bomb them from a height where\nit was almost inevitable you were going to hit the inmates. And if you start bombing\nbarracks of inmates, what is going to be the response politically on \"The United States\nbombs Jewish inmates and the other inmates in Auschwitz\"? And he said there was another\nstrategic consideration: bombing rail lines is a waste of time because they can be repaired\nimmediately. You bomb a few miles of rail lines: so what? They come with a rail train, they\nput a few rails down, so you've delayed them for an hour or two. It isn't going to change\nanything. On the contrary, they'll start killing them faster. He said: \"So in my judgment,\" he\nsaid, \"and not only in my judgement, Ben Rosenman's.\" So we took things to the highest\nlevel. It was not the thing to do, 1t was not in the interests of Nazi victims to do it. If they\nwant to give me the rap, let them give me the rap.\" I said, \"Look: would you like to talk to\nthem?\" He said, \"No.\" I had a long discussion later with him about the Krupp clemency\naction and the releasing of Krupp. I persuaded him that he'd made a mistake, and he sent me\na note saying, \"If I knew then what I know now, after I've written Less Than Slaves and\n[...all the material, I would probably have done it differently.\" I said, \"Can I publish that?\"\nHe said, \"Not as long as I'm alive.\" I will now give that information to the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum and you've got it on tape.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: There were no rules whatsoever because the persons who were sending us out had not the\nfoggiest idea of what we were supposed to do.

A mass grave had been\nuncovered, and he would go out and take one case and I would take the other one, and we\nwould come back when we were through and if we both happened to be in the office at the\nsame time, we would compare notes, more or less.

        "Q: You said earlier that you thought that the Military Tribunals at Dachau were insignificant,\nhistorically.",
        "A: Well, yes because they were in the nature of military commissions. Based upon the Army\nStandards of Court Martial, which was the general guide there, because they didn't have any\nother standards. They were not trying to create new principals in international law like\nCrimes Against Humanity. They were dealing with war crimes. They understood war\ncrimes, because war crimes were prohibited in the Manual of Military Conduct, and they\nknew that a war crime was devastation beyond military necessity. It was rape, pillage,\nplunder. These were things which had for many years been codified as the rules of warfare.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

These were the\nthings that came later with the International Military Tribunal and were generated by the fact\nthat people like Justice Jackson, as well as some of the other British distinguished judges and\nlawyers who were represented on that. These were people who were familiar with the\nbroader principles and concepts of international law and international justice. Whereas in\nthe Army, it was just like, you know, another G.I. trial, where you bring in the accused, he's\nrepresented by another officer or another individual and the judges happen to be army\nofficers who are available to hear the case.",
        "Q: Could you describe an incident that happened to you at Mauthausen when you walked in to\ncollect evidence?",
        "A: Well, there were many incidents at Mauthausen and I suppose that you are referring to a\nparticularly dramatic one which I've mentioned in other context. Coming into a camp was\nalways chaotic. The bodies were strewn all around the place. The troops were chasing the\nGermans or the inmates had captured the Germans and were busy beating them or killing\nthem, and you know people were dying all around. What I would do, as a matter of\nprocedure, I would immediately try to seize the records of what happened in the camp. And\nevery camp had an office, a Schreibstube, writing office. And what I would do, is I would\nimmediately go to the Schreibstube and try to find out who was in charge there, what was\nthere, and seize whatever would be relevant for wartime prosecution. And when I came to\nthe Schreibstube in Mauthausen, there was a inmate there who was a Schreiber, as they\ncalled them, and that was a favored position in fact in the camp if you would be in the\nhospital or the Schreibstube or the kitchen. And he said, \"Oh, I've been waiting for you.\"\nAnd he said: \"Come with me.\" And I recall going out with him to the electrified fence and\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And those records were the records of all\nof the SS men, the identification cards who had entered that camp and who had left the\ncamp, and had their photograph on it. It had their identifying numbers and addresses, date of\nbirth, things of that kind. And he was supposed to destroy each one of those records before a\nnew one was issued or when the man left the camp. He didn't do that, which meant that\nevery time he saved one of those records, there were hundreds of them, he put his life in\njeopardy. And he was ready to do that, hoping and knowing that one day there would be a\nday of retribution. And he saved those records for that day. So to me, it was a reflection of\nhuman hope and confidence and faith and courage which was very moving and dramatic for\nme. Now, there was some other incident which happened here a few weeks ago. I never\nknew who that man was. I admired his courage and his faith. And I never knew who he was\nand when I wrote about that in my book Less Than Slaves, I said he's a man whom I didn't\nknow. And then a few weeks ago I received a letter from a professor at the University of\nParis, the American University of Paris, Professor Pike who had written a book and in that\nbook he had described, I think the book was called The Servants of Stalin or In the Service\nof Stalin. He had described how communists had gone to Spain and had fought on the side\nof liberating forces and when they were defeated by Franco they had fled into France. When\nthe Germans occupied France, the Germans seized them and sent them to the Mauthausen\nconcentration camp to be killed or worked to death. One of those persons was in the service\nof Stalin, according to the book, was the man who handed me those records. And Professor\nPike identified him, and identified him by name, and identified another man in the camp who\nsends regards, who is now in Perpignon, in France, who had been also collecting and hiding\nthe death books registering the exceptional deaths that took place in the camp, listing the\nnames of all of the persons who had been killed by unusual means. And those files were also\nturned over to somebody who signed on behalf of the commanding general of Third U.S.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

But, I asked him if he could get a copy of that record, which the man apparently\nhad kept with him all these years. So, here, fifty years later, we have the coincidences\ncoming out of the blue, the identification of the man who saved those records and one of his\nclose buddies.",
        "Q: Let's go to after the War Crimes Trial. Presumably you're going to come back home. What\nhappened?",
        "A: Well, as the Nuremberg Trials wound down, the Einsatzgruppen Trial was over, I was\nengaged in two activities. One was turning our records over to the Germans in the hope and\nexpectation that they would continue War Crimes Trials. You'll remember that we only had a\nvery small sampling. For example, in the Einsatzgruppen case, we had 3,000 men who were\nengaged in killing Jews for two years every day, and we only tried 22 of them, because of\nthe number of seats we had in the court room. But what about the rest? We had records.\nWe knew who they were. We knew where they had been, and there was material not only in\nthat case, but all of the other 12 subsequent trials had many residual fall outs. So, we set up\nat Nuremberg what we called a Special Projects Division. My wife Gertrude was engaged in\nthat activity as well, and the object was to turn those files over to the Germans, and we\nnegotiated with the various German prosecuting agencies to see if they would take those files\nand act on them. In addition to that, we were trying to publish the records of the Nuremberg\nTrials, which subsequently came out as the \"Green Series\"\u2019\u00ae of the 12 subsequent trials. And\nI was engaged in that as an editor right at the very beginning, and I think my wife was also\nworking on that. We also, incidentally, had a complete German text which was never\nThe rllowine bo named tor the green binding of the proceedings printe d transcripts. document, not this transcript.

It was never published. So, I was doing this wrapping up thing, and looking\nforward to going back and resuming a normal life and starting a law practice in New York.\nThat was my intention. One day I had a visit from a man who was the General Counselor to\nthe American Joint Distribution Committee. This is the Jewish organization which was the\nmost active, and the leading one --the only one-- at the time in assisting the D.P.s in the\ncamps, providing assistance to Jews, throughout the world, not in the United States, at that\ntime it was all in Germany. And their headquarters were in Paris, and their director was a\nman by the name of Doctor Joseph Schwartz. And their counsel said, would I come to Paris.\nThey would like to talk to me. And I came to Paris, and they said, \"Look, we have a\nproblem, and we'd like you to help us with that problem.\" And that problem is this: that the\nJewish organization had succeeded in persuading the U.S. Government to enact a law\nproviding for the restitution of property which had been stolen, confiscated, or taken by\nduress by the Jews or from others, because the restitutional laws covered not only Jews. And\none provision of that law was that the heirless property, or the unclaimed property which had\nbeen taken from those who were no longer there to file a claim should also be restored. Now,\nnormally, if a person dies heirless in the state of New York or anyplace else, the property is\nescheat, they call it, or passes to the state. But there's a principal law which says that they\nmay not be the beneficiary of any unlawful act. If you murder your wife, you cannot inherit\nher property. If you murder the Jews, the state which is responsible can hardly be the proper\nrecipient of the heirless property. So, military government as a matter of military law, don't\nforget Germany surrendered unconditionally, and the only government there was the military\ngovernment originally Quadrapartei, the four powers, later split up but each in their zone.\nThe United States was responsible for the Military Government Law and the U.S.-occupied\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And the military government law number 59, said that a successor\norganization of the appointed to recover the heirless Jewish property. The Jewish Restitution\nSuccessor Organization. And the Jewish organization that succeeded into getting that into\nlaw didn't know where to begin. So, they inquired about and they said, \"Benny, we would\nlike you to be the guy who sets this up. You know your way around Germany. You know\nwhat happened to the Jews.\" I was then a high ranking muckey-muck with the U.S. Army,\nand this was all military occupation at the time. \"We don't think anything will come of it,\"\nhe said, \"but we have a moral obligation to try. And of course we don't have any money to\nput into this, we need our money for relief of the survivors. We have enough to pay your\nsalary for six months\" which was I think six or seven thousand dollars all together, and\nwould you undertake this for us. \"Well,\" I said, \"I'll have to talk to my wife.\" We were\ngetting ready to go home, and we had been in Germany for about two years, and much\nlonger than we had expected. So I came back to Nuremberg, and I discussed it with my\ngood wife Gertrude and she said, \"Look it's true you know this business better than anybody\nelse. How long did they say it would take?\" I said. \"They said it might take two years.\"\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know you. It will only take one year. So, all right, so we'll stretch it a little\nbit longer.\" So, I agreed to stay, and I designated myself the Director General of the Jewish\nRestitution Successor Organization knowing that nothing would impress the Germans more\nthan being a director and a general and so that's how it began.",

        "Q: What was the date that the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization started?",
        "A: I was hired for that job in August 1948 and we had an immediate major crisis. The law\nrequired that all claims be submitted by the end of that year, the end of December '48. That\nwas we had about three months, four months, in which to find staff, find funding, train staff,\nlocate the property, submit the claims on long forms, because this was the first step in a long\njudicial process. Well, the first thing I did was to recognize that that was impossible. So, as\nsoon as I agreed to undertake the job, I resigned from Nuremberg, and I went to see the\nCommanding General who was General Lucius Clay, who was the Commanding General for\nall U.S. Forces in Germany and stationed in Berlin. I had known General Clay from before\nbecause I had been head of the branch in Berlin that had been collecting the evidence for the\ntrials, and I went up to see him and I said \"I've got this problem and I need an extension of\nthe law.\" I said, \"I can't locate all the confiscated Jewish properties, hundreds of thousands\nof properties of all kinds all over Germany in three months time with no staff, no money, no\nnothing, and we discussed the problem and he said, \"No, I don't want to extend the law,\nbecause the sooner we get this problem over with the better off we're going to be. This will\nbe a thorn in Germany's side and I don't want to extend the restitution law.\" I said, \"All\nright, I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll make a deal with you. I will try to get it done, and I will\nonly come back to you if it's impossible, but I will try. But in order to get it done, I need\nmoney. First of all, I need staff.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"Didn't the organization know that when\nthey wanted to get this written into the law that it would cost money to do that?\" I said,\n\"You can't ask the Jewish organization which are now spending every penny they can raise\nto save the lives of these D.P.s to move them out of here and to rescue them to put money\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I said, \"I think we can take the money out of\noccupation funds.\" The United States Army was running on occupation funds, which meant\nthe German treasury printed the money, and we used the money to pay for whatever we\nneeded. He said, \"You know I can't get occupation funds because that requires Quadripartite\napproval. The Russians are going to have to agree. They'll never agree to using their money\nfor private property claims. I don't think the French will agree and I don't think the British\nwill even agree. And I can't do it on my own.\" So I said, \"Well, I have another proposition.\nLet me borrow the money from the American segment of the occupation funds, and when I\nget restitution I'll repay the money.\" He said, \"Can I do that legally?\" I said, \"I have a\nmemorandum here which says you can.\" He said, \"Well, okay, if you say it's legal and I can\ndo it, go down and talk to my finance man and tell him that's it okay and that whatever\nmoney you need to get going, but get going because I want to get this program over with.\"\nSo, I went down and I talked to a guy in charge of finance and I said, \"I just came from the\nGeneral and we're setting up a big restitution program here and we got a big rush job and I\nneed enough funds to get this thing going,\" and he said \"How much do you need?\" And I\nsaid, \" A million marks.\" \"Okay, sign here.\" A million marks was a hell of a lot of money\nand I signed here. I was always ready to sign. I signed promising to repay. With that\nmoney I immediately went out and hired a tremendous staff of German investigators. I had\nrequisitioned cars from the Army using my old Army authorizations as a war crimes\ninvestigator. I immediately seized every Jeep, every car I could grab from any motor pool\nand sent investigators into every real estate registry in Germany with instructions to copy\ndown the names of any Jewish names that transferred property since 1933. Very often the\nGermans had been very helpful to us, and they had stamped a J on the property, meaning\n\"Jude\", so you could identify. But it was a Jewish name, including Alfred Rosenberg, and\nit's true, we claimed the property of the big Nazi leader, Alfred Rosenberg, and the\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So then I set up, in Nuremberg, there were a club that were occupied by\nLatvians, they were mostly drivers. I knew the Latvians. Many of them and the Estonians\nand were very busy killing Jews before they retreated with the Germans and were captured\nby the Americans and then used by the Americans. So, I said, \"We'll throw them out of that\nbuilding. I need it for restitution.\" And bango, I move them out. I move my furniture from\nthe courthouse in Nuremberg as a prosecutor across the street to this Latvian club. And we\nset up there a big hall, a dance hall is what is really was, with tables right touching each\nother. Typewriter on every table, requisitioned or bought or seized from somewhere and 24\nhours a day we filed claims. As they came in from the field, as the investigators came in,\nthey brought the claims in. We had secretaries sitting there typing. I took an eight hours\nshift. Saul Kagan who was my Deputy and the first guy I hired took an eight hour shift.\nAnother man by the name of George Weiss, Dr. George Weiss who came from the JDC in\nParis and later headed the Austrian operations, he handled the third shift, and about the day\nof the filing deadline, we loaded all the claims into U.S. Army ambulance, which I had\nrequisitioned somewhere, and there was a claims center where we had to file these claims.\nAnd we took this ambulance and drove it up the claims center and filed, I think it was\n173,000 claims for 173,000 pieces of property in the American Zone of Germany. And I\ncalled up Lucius Clay and said, \"We don't need an extension. We filed everything.\" So,\nthat's how we submitted the claims, but of course that was only the beginning of the process.\nThe system which was set up was that a person who felt that he had been forced to sell his\nproperty under duress or had it confiscated, was authorized to file a claim setting down all\nthe facts. That then went to a restitution agency special judicial type agency, they weren't\nreally courts, to deal only with these claims. And they would hear the counter claims.\nBecause the person who bought it would say, \"Hey, wait a minute, I paid fair value for it\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The property wasn't even worth more than 80,000 and as a result\nof that he escaped. He sent me three letters when he was in Brooklyn. I don't where he is\nnow but he pulled out the letters and so on. And he didn't file the claim because he felt fairly\ntreated. Who are you to come here and claim the property?\" Or, they claimed, they said,\n\"Look, I bought the property. It was bombed out. It's only a room. I put on a new roof. The\nroof cost me more than the property was worth. Or there was a mortgage on the property. I\npaid off the mortgage. Who's going to give me back the mortgage money?\" And then the\nprocess began. Or there were two or three claimants, some of the heirs claimed them. They\nclaimed, some other person said they bought it in between it had passed through several\nhands. It was a complicated legal process which began. If any party was not satisfied with\nthe decision of the restitution agency, they could go to the restitution court. That was part of\nthe regular judicial system. From there they could file an appeal to the appellate branch of\nthe judicial system in Germany, German courts. And then there was a final court of\nrestitution appeals which was composed originally of Allied judges. Later, it was mixed\nAmerican judges, who sat on the Court of Restitution Appeals, and they would hear the legal\narguments and the factual arguments 1n all of these cases before rendering a final binding\ndecision. Their decisions are all published and I have them, and I have given them to the\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. So, this long legal process began, and for that, we needed\nlawyers. When we got the property back, we needed people who would manage it. We\nneeded people to repair it. We had businesses, hundreds of businesses of all kinds which had\nto be managed and run. And for all of this we had to train people. It never had happened\nbefore in history, and we couldn't trust the Germans. We had to be very careful. I had\naccess to all the Nazi Party files. We hired nobody without a security check which meant\nyou had a very limited selection because we had about nine million Nazi party files in Berlin\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So, it began and it was a very interesting legal process from one\npoint of view to try to create precedents if I give you a few legal questions which came up\nvery early on. Let me just make two or three to show you how history might have been quite\ndifferent with a few wrong decisions. The first key issue we had was at what rate of\nexchange do you have to repay. The principle of the law is simple. Ifa person enters into a\ncontract under duress, when that duress is removed, he has the option of undoing the\ncontract, but he has to give back what he got, and he gets back what he gave. These are the\nprinciples of law that I learned at Harvard. They are principles of equity and they're not\nsomething invented by military government. They should be applicable, and they are\napplicable in one way or another in all civilized societies. But what happened was, when the\nproperty was transferred in 1937 or '38, let's assume the Jewish owner received 100,000\nReichsmark coins, by 1949 or '50 the Reichsmark no longer existed. It was a Deutschmark.\nAnd the Deutschmark was converted at a ratio of ten to one. So he received a 100,000RM\nand he was giving back 10,000DM and the Germans said, Wait a minute. I gave you\n100,000 marks. You're now giving me back 10,000 marks.\" If the Jewish owner had been\nrequired to give back 100,000 marks he would have said the property is not worth it. I'm not\ngoing to put money into Germany's beat up old building there which has been bombed most\nlikely, pay back 100,000DM which was then, an awful lot of money. They didn't have the\nmoney for one thing. It would be completely different. I had a lot of problems with this. I\ntook this case to the Court of Restitution Appeals for the first advisor opinion before we\nbegan the program. And the issue was who bears the burden of the loss? Is it the victim, the\nJewish victim, it didn't have to be Jews, the victim of Nazi persecution, or is it the Nazi or\nthe German, it didn't have to be a Nazi, who acquired the property. To my mind the risk of\nthe currency devaluation should not rest with the victim who sold under duress. It should\nrest with the person who acquired the property just as if he kept his money in the bank, he\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

If the opinion had gone the other\nway, there would have been no restitution program in Germany, practically none. I'll give\nyou another case. A very dramatic case. The German Jews had mostly fled. They were\norganized in what's called Gemeinden; congregations. In Germany every town had their\nown Gemeinde, or congregation. These are legal entities in Germany. They asked anybody\nwho was a member of a congregation had to pay taxes to the state, and the state then\nsupports the congregation out of these funds. The German Jewish congregations had all\nbeen dissolved. Their property had been seized. Property consisted of old age homes,\nschools, cemeteries, buildings of various kinds, lodge buildings and the previous owners\nwere scattered all over the world. They were in Israel, they were in the United States, they\nwere in Chile, they were in Argentina, they were in Shanghai, wherever they could find\nrefuge. But some small groups had reconstituted themselves. They came into Munich.\nVery few of them had been members of that congregation before. They came from Poland.\nThey came from Russia. They came from other places, wherever they were. And they\nreestablished themselves, and said we are now the congregation. Some of them, having been\nforced to survive using all kinds of means were less than the most honorable or credible\npeople. To put it bluntly, some of them were a bunch of crooks as confirmed by their being\narrested from time to time on various charges. And they said, we are the owners. For\nexample, in Munich, they said, look we have set up a new congregation. We are claiming\nrestitution of the property. And I said \"Hold on. You're not claiming restitution of property\nbecause I am the successor organization. The JRSO, Jewish Restitution Successor\nOrganization as designated by Military Government law.\" They said, \"No, this is our\ncongregation.\" The synagogues, old age homes, the cemeteries, whatever it was, and some\nof them were very valuable properties. To make a long story short, I argued that case in the\nCourt of Restitution Appeals, and I remember it quite dramatically, because I addressed the\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I never thought I would stand here\nand argue against the Jewish community, but I have to, because those who are entitled\ncannot speak for themselves. And I made the argument that those who are entitled are\nscattered everywhere and we couldn't give the assets to a small self-proclaimed group who\nwere not subject to any kinds of controls, which we were of course as a charitable\norganization of the Military Government in the first place, under control of all the world's\nJewish organization in the second place. And I won the case. It was known as the\n\"Augsburg Case\" because it was against the Augsburg community. Some of those who\nargued against me ended up in jail. But there again, if that case had gone the other way all\nthe Jewish properties in Germany which had belonged to congregations, would have been\ndissipated and would have disappeared. So, we had several cases like that which were\ndecisive on how this program was to be carried out and we had good luck, I think; well,\nmore than good luck. I think we were on the nght side, and being able to carry out that\nprogram for the recovery of thousands of pieces of heirless and unclaimed Jewish property.\nI don't want to run on too long, but if you would like me to give you some of the difficulties\nwe encountered with that program, I think it may be of Jewish historical interest because in\nthe end, we had to surrender. And we did it in an interesting way. What happened because\nof some of these problems of currency conversion and because of the Germans resented,\nunderstandably resented having to give up their homes which they had lived in. Or their\nbusinesses which they had acquired and changed over the years in many ways that they had\ninvested all kinds of things. And there was no substitutes. I mean, housing was in great\ndemand. So, there was fierce resentment against this strange organization which comes\nalong and insists upon taking the property back and paying only a small fraction of what has\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Or in an outright confiscation paying nothing, because very\noften whatever the Jew got was taken from him by discriminatory taxes of various kinds.

So, it got to be a very, very bitter business, and it was generating\nanti-semitism in Germany which didn't need to have any anti-semitism generated in the\nimmediate postwar or [post-] Hitler years. And I could see that 1t would take a long time.\nMeanwhile the Jews were being moved out of Germany from the D.P. camps to Israel,\nwhich itself was destitute, and it was at war, and there was no place to put them. They were\nin U.S. Army paramital tents which a tent the size of a room, which would have 15 Army\ncots in it. No water, put in open fields, and this was a situation that called for immediate\naction. And I had to generate money at once by every possible means. So, I had to devise\nnew techniques which I'll tell you about in a moment.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

There was a case that I recall where a\nwoman had acquired the home of a Jewish neighbor. I don't remember if it was 1937, '38\nsomewhere around there, maybe even earlier than that, and no claim had been filed except\nby the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization. We asserted the claim. She made the\nusual arguments. I was helping my Jewish neighbor, what do you want. Who are you? We\nsaid never mind, move. We're going to give you back one-tenth of what you paid. It so\nhappened that she was the aunt of an American Army General, who not only was an\nAmerican Army General, he happened to be the Commanding General of the District in\nGermany that was Baden-Wiurttemberg in which she lived. And he called me up and he\nsaid, \"What the hell do you think you're doing? My aunt was no Nazi. She helped her\nJewish neighbor and they didn't file a claim because the were grateful to her, and how do you\ncome off here filing a claim and demanding that she get out of her house and your big deal\nyou're offering her one-tenth of what she paid for it.\" And I said, \"Sir, I'm here to carry out\nthe law. That's what's provided in the law, and I think the law is correct. I negotiate with\nyour aunt. I negotiate with others. We try to reach a settlement. We try to be fair in our\nsettlements and not adhere to the last drop of blood or the pound of flesh. We make the same\noffer to your aunt. If she refuses, I will simply carry out the law which is a Military\nGovernment law, which you may recall, and I'm director general of that organization\nappointed by Military Government to carry out that law, and that's what I intend to do. So\nplease advise your aunt accordingly.\" He said, \"Like hell I will. I'll show you.\" And he\ncalled Mr. McCloy, John McCloy who was the High Commissioner for Germany. Mr.\nMcCloy got on the phone with me and said \"You know, I just got a call from General So-\nand-So. I've forgotten his name actually, and he's raising holy hell. He says you're\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

You're trying to throw her\nout of her house, and all she did was help her Jewish friend. And he's very distressed.\" And\nI said, \"Mr. McCloy, as a good lawyer, you know very well, that a transaction in 1938 was a\nduress transaction and it's voidable at the option of the person whose property was taken. I\nam in the shoes of that person, and I exercise that option as I must to require that the\ntransaction be rescinded, which is what I've done and that is consistent with the law and\nconsistent with my notions of equity and justice, and I'm sure it is with yours.\" And he said,\n\"Yes, I guess it is. I'll call up the General and tell him.\" Well, that's what happened.\nEventually, I think we settled with the aunt. But we had this problem thousands of times,\nagain and again recurring. And it not only took time, but we were not getting the money we\nneeded for these urgent tasks that I've described of saving lives and so I decided to take\nanother approach. And that was to try to sell these claims to the German government, to\neach state government, global settlements. And I went to the Landerpresidenten, the Finance\nMinistries in the different German states in Bavaria, Baden-Wirttemberg, Berlin, and Hesse,\nand I said, \"Look, we've got this problem. We are generating a lot of anti-semitism. You\ndon't want anti-semitism.\" By that time the people who were in office were anti-Nazis,\notherwise they couldn't have gotten into office, and we've got to solve this problem. \"And\nthe way I suggest I we solve it, I'll assign the claims to you so that you're not the beneficiary\nby way of this cheat but then you can settle them on whatever terms you feel are right. If\nyou want to give them back the property, that's your business, but you can't ask the Jews to\nmake that sacrifice in order to maintain peace in your Land.\" And the first such settlement\nwe made was with the Land Hesse, Frankfurt is nearby, it was in Wiesbaden, a big palace in\nWiesbaden. There are some funny stories connected with that but I won't have time to tell\nyou, but that was the first settlement, for 25 million marks, that's a lot of money. Long\nbefore the Hague negotiations, I think it was 1950, 1951, it must have been, in which the\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And then we did this with the other Lander. We went on to Berlin. We had a\nvery difficult problem in Baden-Wurttemberg. The man in charge of Baden-Wurttemberg 1s\na man whose name you'll find in your Holocaust Archives, Otto Kuster. Otto Kuster was a\nvery moral and righteous human being, a very strong sense of justice who was very helpful\nin connection with arguing the I.G. Farben appeal on behalf of slave laborers. And I knew\nhim quite well and I had great respect for him. And he said \"I will not accept the assignment\nof your claims.\" I said \"Why not?\" He said, \"Because you will carry out the law as it is\nintended to be. I cannot. I am an official.\" He was then in charge of restitution of the state\nof Baden-Wiurttemberg. I will not be able to carry out that for political reasons. And it's\nimportant that justice be done and therefore I will not accept your claims. You do it.\" I said,\n\"Have pity. I can't do it. Look at the problems I'm having, the expense, the time, the\naggravation, the anti-semitism that we're causing.\" \"No,\" he said, \"You do it.\" I never\nsettled Baden-Wirttemberg. We settled every where else, but we fought those cases\nthrough, and that where this General's aunt was as well. So, this is an illustration of not only\na specific problem but a difficult political problem which encountered and an economic\nproblem as well. And we solved it legally by assigning our claims globally. Making global\nsettlements with all the Lander. And then the states went on for many years some of them\ncomplained that they paid too much. Some of them recognized that they had made a gain,\nbecause as the years went by the prices went up and so on. But by and large, it was a fair\nand sensible arrangement as I look at it now in retrospect. And it was a way to get out. We\nhad begun on a legal path which seemed right at the time, but found it to be insurmountable\nas it went along. So we had many such problems. If you have time let me tell you some\nmore. Let me tell you another problem, which was a very fascinating problem in a way, too.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nThe problem is what do you do about Jewish cemeteries. I know nothing about the\nOrthodox Jewish rituals, but I had enough common sense to realize that I wasn't going to\ntouch that subject without strict control and guidance by those who knew more than I and\nwere responsible. Under the restitution law the Jewish communities were gone. They all\nhad their own cemeteries. Every congregation had a local cemetery. Sometimes it was\nsignificant plot of land, sometimes there were Jews buried in one portion and had not been\nused for the other portions. So, I set up a Rabbinical council, headed by Rabbi Herzog, the\nchief Rabbi of Israel at that time, Rabbi Leo Baeck, who was the chief German Rabbi when\nthey were driven out, and there was another German Rabbi who represented the Jewish\ncommunities in Germany. And these three were to give me the guidelines of what could be\ndone with the Jewish cemetery once it's been restituted. My instructions to the staff were we\nabide strictly by these rules, and the rules were: once a Jewish cemetery, always a Jewish\ncemetery. You cannot do anything with the land in which somebody is buried. Even if a\ntombstone falls down, you must not pick it up. You must leave it lying there, which was a\nsurprise to me, of course, because all Jewish cemeteries had been desecrated. But if there is\nan area where there are no bodies, then it may fenced off and it can be sold provided it's not\nsold for a profane purpose. What is a profane purpose? You have to go back and look in the\nTalmud. A hospital obviously is not a profane purpose. A dance hall probably is. A\ngambling casino certainly 1s, so we had to know what was being sold and for what purpose it\nwas being sold. Let me just take a minute or two for a very amusing story, or it seems to me.\nWe had a situation of a cemetery in the old town of Fulda. Fulda is in the north of Hesse, 1s\nfamous for the Fulda Gap, where all the armies invade. It's an old Catholic town. Lots of\nchurches, and there was a Jewish cemetery in Fulda, and it was a large area and the social\ndemocratic mayor wanted to use part of the cemetery, which was in the center of town, by\nthe time the years had passed. Originally it was outside the town, but it may have been a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

He said he wanted to use it as a custom house. To build a custom house, itt was right\non the East German border. I inquired with Rabbinical Council, which I did very strictly on\nall such matters and they said custom house, yes, that's okay. I happened to be in New York\nwhen I was reporting to the Board of Directors, a very dramatic telegram. They're building\nthe custom house and they're digging up bones. Well, the contract was very clear, there was\na certain area [in] which Jewish graves were known to exist. That area was to be fenced off.\nThey were going to have a little memorial park next to it. The cemetery itself had been\ndesecrated completely, but we were going to have a little park there with a plaque and the\ncustom house to be built in the area on the blueprint where there were no graves. Well, that\ncreated a major problem. And I rushed back, -- I sent a telegram, seek an immediate\ninjunction. Stop all building, I'm on my way home. And when I got back to -- I think we\nwere in Frankfurt at the time -- I said, how far has it come? Well, they already had about\nfour stories on the building, big building. And one portion of it was seemed to me over the\ngraveside. It was just a small area of maybe 10 by 15 feet and I said \"Tear the building\ndown.\" They said, \"You can't do that. The Jewish community can't do that. We have to live\nin this town. You can't ask me to tear that building down.\" What the hell were they\nthinking, it's a breach of contract. Tear the building down. It's their problem. And they said\nwe can't do that, their life will be unbearable. I said well, let me consult with the Rabbinical\nCouncil. And I consulted with the Council, and they went into a meeting and conference and\nthey finally came up with a solution. And they said, \"The Torah says that you may not have\nanything on the cemetery except a Jewish Prayer house. So, what you have to do is raise the\nbuilding and it's not the cemetery.\" I said, \"Raise a five story building. They may know\nmore about the Torah, but they don't much about engineering. You can't raise a five story\nbuilding.\" So, we went back to the rabbis and said you better look some more. And then\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

If you can't raise the\nbuilding, you have to build the prayer house under the building so that the building rests on\ntop of the prayer house, and there is nothing that says you can't build a building on top of a\nprayer house. Only you can't build it on the cemetery. That's an idea. So what we did, and\nto anybody that ever views this tape, I recommend they go and check it out. In the corner of\nthe customs house in the city of Fulda, there is a small room which is a prayer house built in\naccordance with specifications laid down in Israel, with inscriptions on the wall in Hebrew\nwith stained glass windows and candelabra. There is room for a Torah, there's an ark, but\nthere is no Torah there, and that was built in the basement, excavated under the customs\nhouse and it is the world's most unknown and unused, smallest synagogue that ever existed.\nAnd I went to check up on that ten years later, and I came to the customs house and I said to\nthe concierge, I want to visit the synagogue. They said, \"Well, you go outside and go down\nand turn down to the left, three blocks and then you turn to the right three blocks and there's\nthe Jewish synagogue.\" I said, \"No, no. I want to see the synagogue in this building.\" And\nhe said, \"This building is the custom house.\" I said, \"There better be a synagogue in this\nbuilding. Call somebody.\" So he called somebody upstairs and they came running down\nand said Oh, yes, yes, yes. They had a bunch of keys and took me down into the basement\nand kicked some boxes away from the front of the door and opened the door and said, \"Is\nthis what you're looking for?\" And I said, Yes, that's it. I went in and I inspected it. It was\nstill there and I said, \"Does anybody ever use this?\" He said \"No, never.\" I said, \"Has\nanybody ever been in here?\" He said, \"No, never.\" I said \"Do you keep it clean?\" He said,\n\"We always keep it clean.\" I said, \"Fine, thank you very much. Keep on doing it.\" So, go\nand visit the Customs House in Fulda and check up for me. They are bound to do that\nforever. Let me tell you another story about forever. This is a very serious matter.

Now,\nunder German law, a cemetery is maintained for only twenty years. The system there 1s\nevery town has their own cemetery, and everybody who is a resident of that town is entitled\nto be buried in that cemetery. And they go one after the other. As you die, you're put in the\nrow in a small place, very orderly. The Germans are very orderly people. And after twenty\nyears, you're required to take away the tombstone or they'll take it away for you, and they put\nsomebody else in the same spot. Saves ground, saves money, and I guess it saves emotional\nsentiment, they say after twenty they say stop grieving. Well, they were quite prepared to do\nthat, but as we were reaching the end of the twenty year period, they said \"Now you take\ncare of the cemeteries.\" I said \"Wait a minute. Jewish law requires the cemetery to be\nmaintained forever.\" The said, \"Forever? It costs money. You have to cut the grass, have a\nfence around it. It costs money. We're not going to pay that. If you have a peculiar ritual,\nwe're not bound by that. Why should we treat you better than we treat our own?\" Well, it\ngot to be a very emotional argument. A very dramatic argument. I had just come back from\nAuschwitz. Anyway, the Germans were finally persuaded to accept the Jewish ritual, and\nthey do maintain the cemeteries in Germany in perpetuity. This was also part of the\nrestitution program, things the public doesn't know anything about.",

        "Q: Ben, tell me something about the cultural restitution of cultural objects.",
        "A: Since the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, JRSO, or as the Germans called it,\nJRSO\"\u2019, was authorized to claim all unclaimed or heirless Jewish property. It also recovered\nthousands, many thousands of Jewish cultural objects, which had been assembled by the\nGermans. For example, the Germans collected Torah scrolls. A warehouse full of Torah\nscrolls. Tons of Jewish ceremonial objects taken from all the occupied territories. It was in\nEinsatzstab Rosenberg Special Unit, Alfred Rosenberg was the Nazi ideologue and it was\nnamed in his honor which had that as their assignment to go and seize all Jewish cultural\nobjects and hold them. The Nazis had various plans for them. These were eventually\nassembled in a big warehouse in Wiesbaden in the custody of the United States Army, and\nthey in turn turned it over to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of which I was\nthe director. Now, thereto, out first goal was to try to locate the owners if there was a\nKiddush plate or something that had the name \"This 1s the family of so-and-so of Warsaw\"\nwe tried to find out where the man was. If it came from the congregation that still existed we\ntried to send it there. We did the same incidentally with individual properties of restitution.\nIf the owner showed up later and said, I didn't file a claim on time or it was too short, but I'm\nreally the owner, I'm really the heir, we worked out what we called an equity procedure of\ngiving the property back to the real owners, subject to a very modest 10 percent I think it was\nservice charge for the expense in getting it back. So, here our first goal was to restore it to\nthe rightful owners. But usually you couldn't tell. So, the next goal was try to distribute\nthem wherever they were needed for Jewish reconstruction, the reconstruction of Jewish life.\nThe rllowine Fronouned the ase a recorded interview.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nAnd a separate entity was set up by the Jewish organizations to do that called Jewish\ncultural reconstruction. And Professor Salo Baron of Columbia University was a member of\nour board of directors was in charge of that and Hannah Arendt was one of the persons who\nfirst came to Germany to help guide us with what to do with these things. Because I really --\nI was a young fellow, I didn't really know anything about Jewish cultural life in Germany\nand particularly the religious life. So, we set up this Jewish cultural reconstruction, and we\nhad staff. We were still in Nuremberg. This was the very early days, to come in to help us\nwith that. Hannah Arendt was one and then we brought in experts from Israel. There was a\ngentleman by the name Narcus, another Shanomi who came from the Museum\nin Israel to help us with the Kiddush cups and with the pointers and the Torah crowns and all\nof the objects. We also had people restoring them. We had, for example, a school of scribes\nworking in Paris, to restore Torah scrolls, and I learned that a scroll can be repaired except if\nthe word \"Shaddai,\" or God, is injured in which case you cannot -- if that's been damaged\nyou cannot restore that. The Torah scroll has to buried in Israel, following a certain religious\nritual. All of which we followed very precisely. I was very insistent on that. I said \"Look\nwe take the law as laid down by the Rabbinical Council, and we don't vary that in any way\nand that is absolutely strictly to be observed.\" And it was. The School of Scribes sat in Paris\nunder the control of the JDC and they repaired those Torahs that could be saved, and the\nRabbinical Council would advise where they were needed. New congregations in Israel, big\nrecipients. Congregations in other parts of the world where they needed some sent as\nremembrance scrolls to different communities throughout the world. And we did the same\nwith the ceremonial objects. Where we could find the owner, we restored them. Where we\ncouldn't, we returned them. Where it was damaged, we restored them, we then distributed\nwherever it was needed, and at the end we still had tons of broken silver. Knives, forks,\ndishes, plates. All kinds of little bits and scraps. And the question was what do we do with\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And I, being very careful, found a Jewish silversmith, Goldsmith Brothers in London,\nand I said, all right we'll send it to them. They cannot be repaired. We cannot trace the\nowners. They are just scraps. Nothing can be done with it. We'll smelt it down and we'll\nuse the proceeds then for Jewish charity. I thought that was being very clever. And I went\nto the board of directors in New York, where we had our annual meetings and I reported on\nthe great care that we exercised in disposing of all these things and I was feeling very cocky\nand very proud of myself and I said and now we have received $50,000 for these silver\nscraps which we sent off to the silversmith Goldsmith Brothers in London, and they smelted\nthem and they sent us the proceeds and this is now available for distribution by the charitable\norganizations. Whereupon the first person to raise his hand a member of the board of\ndirectors. A very distinguished elderly gentleman. He is now and was less elderly then, he\nis still living, Isaac Lewin who was the Chairman of Augudat Israel world organization, and\nhe said \"Mr. Ferencz, do my ears believe me? You took these holy objects and you sent\nthem to a crematorium?\" Boy, I knew from that question that I was cooked, and I tried to\nexplain the best I could that it was not really a crematorium it was just our way of trying to\ncarry out our assignment and realized that assets to the benefit of those who survived. I don't\nthink he really ever forgave me for that. But we did become good friends in later years. But\nit's an illustration of some of the problems you know of dealing with this new area which had\nnever been done before. We had paintings which we disposed of, and we had all kinds of\nthings.

Where there had been collections of it. Let me tell you another\nstory of collections. Among the collections were, of course, many Jewish books, prayer\nbooks of various kinds, some incunabla.'* I'm not sure exactly what that is but old Jewish\nbooks of great value. The Germans had also collected such books, I mean the German\nUniversities, German churches, part of their religious studies, and the Nazis had picked that\nup too. So, the previous owners had been institutions that had legitimately acquired those\nbooks. And they were quite valuable. One day a Jewish rabbi, a chaplain I think his name\nwas Bernstein, pulled up with an ambulance to the back of one of these archives and selected\nsome of the most valuable Jewish books, and filled up the ambulance and put them on a ship\nsmuggling immigrants to Israel, Palestine, as it was then known. And so, these were books\nwhich had belonged to legitimate German institutions and had been lawfully acquired. So, it\nwas a case of unlawful confiscation. And one day I got a call from General Clay, and he said\n\"Benny, you better come up here. We got a problem.\" And he said, \"I have this captain. I'm\nabout to court martial him for stealing Jewish German property. And he said we have a\nrestitution program here restoring property to those from whom it was unlawfully taken.\nThat doesn't mean you can go out and steal property from the Germans, and I think I'm going\nto have to court martial him.\" I said, \"Look, don't do that for God's sake. Is that really\nnecessary? Mitigating circumstances, he thought it was Jewish property?\" He didn't know, I\ndidn't know. I said, \"I'll get it back.\" He said, \"All right, you go and get it back for me.\" I\nsaid \"Okay, I'm going to go to Israel. I have to deliver a shipload of prefabricated houses\nbought from Austria with restitution money. I'll get it back. Give me a list.\" So he gave me\na long list, I don't know ten, twelve pages of different books of which I didn't know nothing,\n'S Incunabla generally refers to any broadsheet printed before 1500 with Gutenberg movable type.\nThe follow ys Instance: it ike eters to Torah scroms and holy book primary source document, not this transcript.

Where is it?\" He said, \"It's in Mount Scopus.\" I said, \"Let's go\nup to Mount Scopus and get it. I got to bring it back. I promised him I'd bring it back and\nthey're going to let this captain off the hook.\" Meanwhile they sent him home. They sent\nhim right home, Philip Bernstein it was. I said well, Mount Scopus, and they said you can't\ngo up there. The Arabs are up there, it's between us and the Arabs. It was the old city. So,\nyou can't go up there. It's Hebrew, Mount Scopus, you can't get there. I said, \"When can I\nget there?\" He said, \"When the war's over.\" Good, I'll tell that to Clay. So, I go back to\nBerlin, and I report to General Clay and I tell him, \"Sorry, General, they're ready to make\nrestitution, but the Arabs are there. If you send me some tanks, I'll go get it, but otherwise\nyou'll have to wait until things quiet down and then we'll get restitution. And he accepted\nthat. And then, of course, he left shortly thereafter, and Mr. McCloy came in, and to my\nknowledge, that has never been settled by way of restitution, although we did have such a\nproblem in the Hague negotiations with the Germans, and I think the Templars, a German\nsociety, whose land was taken in Israel, they made some kind of a deal which may have\nincorporated some of these books. I really don't know. But it was a case of the Jewish\norganization being required to make restitution. Whether they did or not, I really cannot\nswear.",

        "A: Oh, yes, well of course. We stayed in Germany -- we expected to stay for one year. After\nbeing there for ten years, we had four children, and I just didn't want them to be raised in\nGermany, and neither did my wife, so we decided to resign from these organizations and\nreturn to New York. But I did remain as an advisor to the organization for very many years\nafter that.",
        "Q: What was life like there for you and your family there?",
        "A: It was a colonial, cloistered existence. Perhaps you could ask my wife to explain what it was\nfrom her point of view. We didn't fraternize. The first German I let into my house after\nliving in Germany for seven years, as a guest, anyway, was Professor Franz Bohm, who had\nwalked out of the German delegation in protest against the action of his government. But I\nmay tell you about that when we talk about Hague negotiations. But it was a very colonial\ntype existence. The Americans fraternized only with the Americans. Germans were used as\nservants. There was a time when cigarettes were the currency. Everything was very cheap.\nIt was a comfortable life like the British living in India would be comparable. There were\nsome tensions before the Einsatzgruppen defendants were executed. I received several death\nthreats. I took the name off my door. We had death threats later in connection with the\nHague negotiations with we may have a chance to go into. But it was comfortable in the\nsense that we could travel. It's nice county. Nothing wrong with the mountains. We could\ntravel to Bavaria, we traveled to other parts of Europe. We were young, and but it was not a\nhappy place to be. You always felt beleaguered sort of. You were surrounded by persons\nthat regarded you as vermin the years before, and suddenly they never heard of such a thing,\nso you felt rather entrapped and besieged in a hostile sea. But, nevertheless, they were not\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

        "Q: Did you see black market activity being done?",
        "A: Nobody could live in Germany without seeing black market activity. Germany was run on\nthe black market. Everything was black market. There was nothing else outside the black\nmarket. There were rations, sure. I mean you could choose between bread or beer. There\nwas an official black market in Berlin, for example, just set up by Mrs. Clay, where 1n order\nto attempt to curb the wild black market they could bring their stuff to this central black\nmarket -- 1t wasn't called that, it was trading post or something, and they would get coupons\nfor so many pounds of coffee and so many coupons for a camera, Leica camera and then you\ncan exchange one against the other. Cigarettes were the currency, literally. People would\nwork for you for cigarettes. For cigarette butts, so it was very grim from that point of view.",
        "Q: Was it helpful -- Black Market helpful or always harmful?",
        "A: Well, it's hard to answer that question. I did have a discussion with this Doctor Schwartz in\nParis about that. It's interesting that you should raise it. The Jews were receiving from the\nJDC equivalent of CARE parcels. They were parcels containing various things that they\nneeded, sugar, coffee, clothing, material to make [clothing], and the JDC was sending in\nmostly cigarettes, because that was the most negotiable item. And I discussed that with Joe\nSchwartz from a moral point of view. I said, \"Look, all the DP are now trading cigarettes,\nit's illegal, it's black market. Don't you think you are better off setting up soup kitchens\nrather than just sending in these things. They're all on their own.\" Which meant that they\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And he said, \"No. I think that, first of all, we get\nmuch more bang for our buck this way.\" You know, this was the currency of trade. The\ncigarettes were cheap, and you can buy a lot for it, and we need -- we're short of funds,\" as\nthey always were. \"Secondly,\" he said, \"it's an outlet for their emotions and they were\nreturned to normal life once they are taken out of this atmosphere.\" So that my concern was\nthat their moral standards would be destroyed by engaging in illegal activities. They would\nlose all respect for law. And I couldn't persuade him was the end of it, and in retrospect, he\nprobably was right, because in order to survive, legality was rather irrelevant. They were\nliving in an unlawful world, an unlawful state. And they did whatever they had to do in\norder to survive, and in that kind of atmosphere to come as I was inclined to do, being a\nlawyer, with notions of strict legality, was unrealistic and perhaps unfair. And I was overly\nconcemed about that. Anyway, the black market did, in time, as the economy improved,\ndisappeared. I'm not sure that it did any big harm anywhere. It exchanged goods; a lot of\nGerman goods were exchanged for a lot of cigarettes. But, another form of restitution,\nperhaps, but I don't think it had any permanent significance.",
        "Q: Did you visit any DP camps during these years?",
        "A: Yes, indeed, of course there were DP camps everywhere, and we had some relatives in DP\ncamps, some cousins of my wife. I had no personal relatives of my own there, but some\ncousins of my wife were there and there also the conditions were of course very rough, but\nnot as compared as to the concentration camps. But everyone was very eager to recreate\ntheir lives. They were remarrying any survivor, you know marrying and raising children as\nquickly as they could in defiance that Hitler was not going to succeed.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "Q: What was done to help the victims with their own injuries?",
        "A: That seems to me to be perhaps the most important, or next to the most important phase of\ndealing with Holocaust problems. Holocaust begins with stopping the Holocaust. Wars are\nholocausts, worst forms of holocaust. The next phase is to hold accountable those who\nbrought it on. These are the war crimes trials. The third phase is trying to restore what had\nbeen destroyed or taken during the war, that's the restitution program, and then the next\nphase is the victims. What about the victims? People tend to forget in the drama of the\ncourtroom, they think ah, the criminals are punished; it's over. It's not over. The victims are\nmore important than the criminals. Criminals can be punished or killed. It doesn't make a\nbig difference unless it's a deterrent to the repetition of the crimes. But what do you do about\nthose who survived? And this was a problem which was not addressed by military\ngovernment except in the very crudest way of seeking compensation for time spent in a\nconcentration camp, but it's much more complicated than that. The victims suffered all kinds\nof losses, and if you approach the problem legally, then it requires a completely different and\nmuch more expanded approach and that was the next thing that happened. If you want me to\ntell you about that now, I'll tell you how it began, and how it was approached. The notion\nthat the individual survivors of Nazi persecution, Jewish or non-Jewish, should be\ncompensated for their injuries is an old notion. It was quite obvious to anyone who was\nconcemed with the subject, and people had begun to write about it in Israel, in the United\nStates, about compensating victims of personal injuries. Germany was eager to reenter the\nfamily of nations. Konrad Adenauer was a devote Catholic, anti-Nazi who had been saved\nby the help of Jewish friends when the Nazis had been trying to drive him out as mayor of\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He was able to that through a banker in London by the name of Noah Beru (ph)\nwho established first contacts with the German government, this is the post Nazi government\nsaying let us try to arrange something. Nahum Goldman was involved very early. Noah\nBeru was connected to the World Jewish Congress. Nahum Goldman was president of the\nWorld Jewish Congress, which he had created, and the very skillful negotiator and a very\ndiplomatic person really, and the first question was: are the Germans serious? No one\ntrusted the Germans, but the feeling was, look, what are the options? To let them get away\nwith it and walk away and say nothing? There was a Biblical phrase that was used \"Thou\nshalt not kill the victims and steal their property and get away with it.\" It was the same thing\nwith compensation. It was behind the restitution programs. But compensation is something\nelse. Compensation is payment for individual injuries sustained. And Adenauer, of course,\nhad to clear with his government. He was conservative, CDU, Conservative Democratic\nUnion'\u201d. The socialist were more inclined. They themselves had been Nazi victims, many\nof them. And so, the first thing that was necessary was to test their sincerity, and Goldman\nsaid look, I want to have a commitment of a minimum of a billion dollars, maybe it was a\nbillion marks. Goldman never knew the difference between dollars and marks. It had to be a\nbig figure. If it's a billion, that's a lot. The Germans didn't know what a billion was because\nthey called it a Milliard, a thousand million. Anyway, Adenauer was able to give him\nassurances that after clearing with his Parliament that the negotiations would be serious and\neventually the agreement was reached that we would enter into negotiations. But\nnegotiations would have three parties. One the German government, by that I mean the\nWest German government. The East German government never answered.\nCommunications were sent to them. This only began after Germany was restored to it's\nThe rllowine Correction: Christian recor atic Union. recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

And the\nagreement was reached that negotiations would be entered into on neutral territory. No\nJewish organization wanted to go into Germany. I started to say there were three parties. On\none hand the Germany government, on the other hand, the state of Israel. The state of Israel\nat that time was a very new state. It had a lot of enemies. The whole Arab world was aligned\nagainst it, and they need someone to represent the Jews not in Israel, because Israel never\npurported to speak for Jews who were not in Israel. And who was to speak for them? Most\nof the Jews were not in Israel. They had fled. Polish Jews, Russian Jews, German Jews, so a\nthird party was necessary, and Goldman had the genius to put it together in what he called\nThe Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. It began as a Conference and\nthen kept the name Conference. It should have been committee or something else, but it kept\nthe name and it consisted of a collection of the leading Jewish organizations in the world, the\nWorld Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, The American JDC, Central British\nFund, The Jews of Argentina, The Jews of France. They all came together and formed a\nNew York corporation called The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany,\nand they were going to be the third negotiating party. So that the Germans would be\nnegotiating with all the Jews of the world and the negotiations would take place at a secret\ndestination in a neutral country. To give you some idea for the feel for it. There was a big\noutcry in the Jewish community, particularly in Israel: this is a betrayal of Jewish honor.\nYou are selling my mother. You are trying to get money for blood. Those who do this will\nbe betrayed by the Germans. The only good German is a dead German. We want nothing to\ndo with them. We don't want their lousy money, have nothing to do with them. You are a\nbetrayer of the Jewish people if you dare to sit with them. Menachem Begin was the leader\nof the Irgun at the time.

They had sent a letter bomb\nto the head of the German delegation. To give you a little closer feel of what this is like, the\npreparations for this meeting took place at the Grosvenor House in London for about a week\nbefore we were going to go in, and we were then trying to prepare the opening statement. I\nwas there as counsel to the claims conference, because I was the director of the JRSO, so I\nknew about restitution. I knew what had happened more or less and so I was an expert, so\ncalled, in the field. There were other experts who were much more expert than I in the fields\nof reparations and so on. I think Hemmy Robinson (ph) and his brother Jacob Robinson\nwere really very learned international lawyers coming out of Lithuania, but we had a crew\nwas working in the Grosvenor House 1n London trying to prepare the opening statement and\ndecide on what theory and what are we asking for, and how do you justify it. Since my wife\nand I had parachuted out of plane over Berlin some recent time before, I was not eager to fly\nto wherever the meeting place was to be, and it was rumored that it was to be in Brussels.\nSo, I said, \"Look, tell me. I'll get there by train.\" And I was told when we left the Grosvenor\nHouse, you'll be given an envelope. Don't open until you get into the taxi and when you get\nthere, then open it and follow the instructions. We were under the security guard of the\nIsraeli Secret Service, and I opened it up and it said proceed to Hoek von Holland. I went to\nHoek von Holland. I said it's a strange way to go to Brussels, but I figured as much that you\nknow it's some other destination. And there I was checked out the customs. I came in and\nthey looked at my passport, looked me over and Mr. Ferencz, yes, just a moment, and then\nthey had some man come out of the back room and said come with me and I sat in a big\nblack buick and off we drove into the night. After daylight began to break, I said to the man,\n\"Excuse me, can you tell me who are you and where are you taking me.?\" \"Oh,\" he said,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Dawn was\nbreaking, we pull in to what looks to me like an old castle. It was . And it\nseemed to me I see SS men with police dogs there. And then my heart just sunk into my\nstomach. The Einsatzgruppen defendants had been executed not long before and I thought I\nhad walked into a trap. There was a Nazi on the ground as well. But as I looked a little more\nclosely, what I first glanced over SS were the Dutch Police. They wear the same type\nuniform. Black uniform without the death head and without the silver stripe on the pants.\nAnd when I noticed that very quickly and I realized it was not a trap. But I came in, I\nchecked in at the desk; this castle had been converted to a hotel, a first-class hotel, and I was\nassigned a room. What I was told was open no drawers. Open no doors. There's a\npoliceman stationed on every floor, and if there's anything suspicious, don't touch anything.\nImmediately alert the policemen on every floor. And the German delegation came in,\nheaded by Professor Franz Bohm, and Otto Kuster, whom I had mentioned and Bohm\nreceived a letter bomb envelope. A letter bomb envelope is an ordinary looking envelope\nwhich has a paper inside and at the bottom of it there is black powder and a detonator so\nwhen you pull it out the detonator explodes the powder and it will kill anybody who has it in\ntheir hands or anybody nearby. That was intercepted by the Israeli police and we were told,\nbe careful, because we knew that a member of the Stern Gang and the Irgun had entered\nBrussels looking for us and was already in Holland. They had been tracking him. So, it was\nfilled with a lot of apprehension. There was a plane coming in from Israel with two Israeli\ndelegates, crashed over Frankfurt, crash landed and killed everybody on the plane. We don't\nknow that there was any connection. We did not have any advance notice of that, and I don't\nknow to this day. It may have been just an unfortunate coincidence. I hope it was. But it\nwas an area of high tension. When Goldman appeared in Israel, the Knesset was stoned.\nWhen they debated this there was people marching in the streets against him trying to kill\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And what we're trying to do is create a sense of justice for the injuries. The\nGermans coined the term \"Wiedergutmachung,\" which literally means make good again.\nBut you can't make good again, this kind of injury. All you can do is try to ameliorate it to\nsome extent. And then I felt, and the others who were connected with it, was a moral\nobligation as well as a legal obligation. If you injure someone, you owe them the duty of\ntrying to make recompense as best you can and to heal them as best you can. And that\nproblem continues to this day: the Japanese use of comfort women and so on in other parts of\nthe world. It's a continuing problem, but at that time it was new. No one had ever done this\nbefore. No one had ever sat down after a war to provide individual compensation to the\nvictims of not only that war, but the persecutions related to it. And to work out the principles\nand to set up the machinery and to put it into legislative form so that it will be passed by a\nparliament and be enforced by a whole series of judicial instruments and courts and agencies\non an enormous scale, I mean millions of claims, Jews and non-Jews. This was not strictly a\nJewish program. No one should mistake that. The Jews were the primary targets and\ncertainly the worst targets, -- although the gypsies were close behind of the Nazi\nextermination programs -- but there were very many other victims including German victims\nand it would be a mistake to disregard them. And we didn't disregard them in trying to work\nout the compensation laws to indemnify them for their injuries. We never made a distinction\nbetween Jews and non-Jews. They all had equal rights under the law.",
        "Q: Then what happened?",
        "A: Well, let me give you some ideas of the legal principals involved. First, what do you ask\nfor?

Three billion marks was to go to Israel to help cover some of the costs\nthat they had incurred in absorbing the immigrants of Nazi persecution, trying to rehabilitate\nthem. It was a global sum, which at that time was vital for the salvation of Israel. Germany\nhad no money. Germany was devastated. How do you pay it? It was repaid over a period of\nten to twelve years. The first payments were oil shipments. Israel was at war. What were\ntheir primary needs? The Claims Conference was to get five hundred million dollars for\ncompensation to the Jews outside of Israel. That was for organizational assistance. Then we\nhad, from these payments incidentally, the Israeli railroads were built. The Israeli electrical\nsystem was built in Germany. If anybody's been in Israel they know that taxi cabs are all\nmade by Mercedes. This was a great help, and it was rather ironic that the state which had\nset out to destroy the Jews was so helpful in fact in enabling the only Jewish state to survive.\nAnd it was so. And people like to forget it and say no, but it's an unfair thing to do. Then,\nwhat do you do for the individual? How do you measure? Well, we decided very early on,\nwe were not going to ask anything for loss of life. You don't take six million dollars or six\nbillion dollars for the loss of six million lives. But you do take the ordinary principles of\nlaw. Ifa child lost his father, who was his provider, and the provider was a high income,\nmiddle income or low income person he'd be entitled to compensation based upon that. But\nhe had to prove that he had a father, and that his father was murdered by the Nazis, that the\nfather had a certain income, that a certain portion of that income would have been used for\nthat child, that it would have been for that child for a certain number of years, that the\nGerman government should pay for it, that they should pay for it for a limited or permanent\nperiod of time, they should pay in whole or in part or a percentage. How much can they\nafford to pay? The Leistungsfahigkeit, the ability to pay, was the theme song. We have\nother obligations to pay.

        "Q: Ben, can we talk about what sort of problems you had in with the Claims Conference in\nterms of was it like what happened with restitution?",
        "A: Well, the Claims Conference was the umbrella organization acting as the voice of the Jewish\ncommunity. Nahum Goldman had obtained authorization, in fact, to speak for Israel, so we\nhad one voice speaking for the Jewish community, which was important. The first thing I\ndid was I set up an office in Bonn, to serve as a lobby to watch the Germans and see that\nthey carried out the program. Nahum Goldman was very effective every time he came to\nBonn, which was quite regularly, he would meet with the heads of the different political\nparties in order assure their support. The man that I sent to be in charge of the office in Bonn\nwas a man who had worked for us in Nuremberg, a former Jewish Berlin lawyer by the name\nof Herbert Schoenfeld who was a bachelor and a very charming man. And he said, \"What\nshall I do in Bonn?\" I took him out, he was head of the JRSO Stuttgart office and I said\n\"You make friends. All you have to do is make friends.\" And I gave him a big American\ncar, which cost nothing because I got it from the Army and we had free gasoline and free\nlogistic support, and I said, \"I want to know what the Germans are thinking before they think\nit.\" And he was the man for that. He knew all the secretaries. He knew all the people in\nBonn. He was very popular. The problem was to persuade the Germans to make the size of\npayments and category of payments that we wanted. And the Germans didn't want to. They\nhad their own financial problems. The finance minister said, \"Look, this will bankrupt\nGermany. We can't accept these unlimited liabilities.\" At one time we even talked about\nrequiring every German to pay one mark a week or a month toward a fund so that they\nwould realize that they were paying compensation for what had happened in their name, but\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So, the Germans\nundertook, with great hesitation, different categories of payments. The German public was\ncompletely unaware. They felt no pain whatsoever as a result of these programs. Germany\nprospered and the losses were much greater than anyone had anticipated. We had made our\nappraisals beforehand and had estimated it would be six billion marks or nine billion marks\nand the Germans said oh no it's going to be 12 billion marks and we can't afford that. By the\ntime this program is over, it will cost the Germans well over a 100 billion marks. They\nalready passed the 100 billion mark figure. That, in today's dollar, at seventy cents a mark, a\nhundred billion marks would be about 70 billion dollars is what it would cost the west\nGerman government, now the reunited German government, to meet these claims. There\nwere literally millions of claims filed. I think it was three or four million claims, Jews and\nnon-Jews alike. Don't forget that these were not only Jewish claims. And the response we\nhad, the claims had to be proved in every case the individual claimant had to prove that he\nwas injured as a result, direct consequence of Nazi action. If he could prove that he was\npermanently disabled, he would get a lifelong pension, and they're paid now -- I don't how\nmany are still alive, but the last trme I looked at the count, a few years ago perhaps, there\nwere over a hundred thousand Nazi victim survivors, Jewish Nazi victim survivors, who\nwere getting life long pensions from the West German government. Most of these people\nare in Israel. The D-mark is very valuable currency. The Israel currency would fluctuate.\nThis was a life saver for them. In order for them to get recognition, however, they had to\npersuade the German doctors that the disability was caused by the persecution. That was not\neasy because for years they denied that there could be any mental disability caused if it did\nnot appear immediately on liberation. Many people, and anybody who was in the business\nwho knew the people knew it was so, managed to hold themselves together for many years,\nand then maybe five, ten, twenty years later, suddenly they would break down. By that time,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I must say they were hostile. And the German\nagencies that we had to deal with this were very often hostile. It depended upon the area.\nBerlin, for example, was known to be more liberal. There was a man in charge there named\nLipschitz who was very kind and tried to be fair. In Bavaria, we had nothing but troubles,\ntough fighting all along the way. And this required legal services of all kinds to help the\nclaimants. The claimants themselves never really understood. They said it's\nWiedergutmachung, why didn't they get more? What they got seemed to them to be paltry,\nand it was in many respects. And they couldn't understand that every case was different.\nThey'd say my sister got the same, and my friend, it was the exact, why did they get more\nthan I did? Well, there was always a reason. Sometimes it wasn't a good reason, but to have\nthem understand that was very difficult. So, this entire program, which expanded as we went\nalong, it was originally intended to be over by ten years, I knew it would never be over in ten\nyears, the laws had to be modified. They were expanded. Finally the Germans were getting\ntired of that and they called it the SchluBgesetz, the final law. Well after they got through\nwith the SchluBgesetz, it wasn't SchluB. They had to come with the hardship fund. And then\nafter the hardship fund they came with another hardship fund because every time you started\nto implement the program, you discovered the loss was much greater than you anticipated,\nthan any of us anticipated. And since Germany was prospering, and many of these payments\nwere linked to their own civil service, so that when their own civil servants got a raise in\ntheir pensions, the Jewish Nazi victims got not the same amount, they never got the same\namount, but something lesser, but they also got some raise. And so over the years these\npayments were very significant.

The awareness and recognition that\nthe wrongdoer has an obligation to his victim to try to help him; from a legal point of view,\ndeveloping the principles of compensation, the principles of law which should bind people\nunder similar circumstances. Which I hope are never repeated but which I fear are being\nrepeated. So, when you look at it as I look back upon it, I think it was a very great thing. It\nwas done in the name of all the Jewish organizations on behalf of the Nazi survivors. It was\ninadequate to make good again any of their suffering, but at least 1t was a gesture that\nsomebody cared. They had not been forgotten.",

        "A: No, the Claims Conference didn't handle claims except the hardship claims which came\nlater. But the claims had to be submitted to a German agency, and if you were not satisfied\nwith that you had again to go through the German judicial system up to the German supreme\ncourt and German constitutional court and the United Restitution Organization which was\nanother organization I was involved when it was set up and I was the director of that, we\ntook many cases to the German Supreme Court and had to take them to constitutional court\nto assert our rights.

        "A: Well, I think the fundamental story which disturbed me for many years was the German\nfailure to recognize the Spatschaden, the late claims. These ailments which would appear\nonly years later, several years later, particularly mental illness, but it was not only mental.\nPeople would suddenly get heart trouble and other things. And the Germans refused to\nrecognize that although medical science was beginning to recognize that people who had\nbeen subjected to trauma might have this late syndrome, which I may be a victim of myself,\nbut they began to recognize it when the German troops began coming home from the Soviet\nUnion. Suddenly they realized that these soldiers who had been subjected to the most\ndifficult circumstances while in Soviet captivity were suffering from mental ailments of\nvarious kinds and other physical ailments and they began to compensate them. Incidentally,\nthe payments made to German SS officers, their pension payments were vastly higher than\nany amounts given to Jewish survivors. Although they were important to the Jewish\nsurvivors, we don't want to exaggerate their importance in relationship to Germany's overall\nbudget and how much they would spend on their own, their widows of their own fallen SS\nheroes as they considered them. And SS officers. And so this whole category of mental\nailments was badly treated by the Germans, very badly treated for very many years, and\nmany people died before they could get any compensation, and it had to be reversed by the\nCourts. And some court decisions were outrageously unfair to the claimants.",

And we did that.",
        "Q: Did you have help from the Jewish organizations?",
        "A: Well, this was all done in the name of the Jewish organizations, fortunately for them for\neverybody I guess, they didn't have to put any money into this because we generated all the\nmoney on the ground, from the first payment that supported all the meetings and all the\nsalaries and everything else. I also managed to get tax exemptions from Germany for many\nof these expenditures. And the organizations themselves they welcomed Germany paying of\ncourse, and were always prepared to go to Washington with the delegation and say \"Pay\nmore.\" Particularly if 1t got in the New York Times, or even in the Jewish Week or Jewish\nTelegraphic Agency, but in terms of making a sacrifice, it's fortunate for the victims that the\nJewish Organizations were not called upon to make sacrifices.",

There was no member of the German bar who was not a Nazi. It was a\nrequirement. If you were not a Nazi you couldn't be admitted to the bar. The prospect of\nJewish Nazi victims going to German lawyers and paying them in an effort to get\ncompensation, the nature of which was highly uncertain, and the value of which was highly\nuncertain was not something that they would do. If there were no agency to assist them with\ntheir claims, the whole legislative programs that we worked out would be meaningless. And\nso, we set up, by we, I mean again I was the director the JDC was the leading body, there\nhad been a small organization of German Jewish lawyers who had fled from Germany and\nset themselves up in England and they were handling some restitution claims for the return\nof property. They were being supported by the JDC and the Central British Fund and I think\nthe Jewish Agency. Very small payments and a very small program. And when I set up the\nprogram, I incorporated them. They were called the United Restitution Office. I called it the\nUnited Restitution Organization to retain the continuity. Their chairman was a very fine\ngentleman by the name of Professor Norman Bentwich, a distinguished Englishman, a dear\nfriend, an outstanding citizen. And then I expanded it with money that the Germans had\npaid. I borrowed from the Claims Conference a few million dollars and expanded that\noperation. The Claims Conference got the money from the Germans. I repaid it to the\nClaims Conference later and expanded the organization so that when I left Germany in 1956,\nI had a staff of 250 German lawyers, 1,200 people, offices in 19 different countries. Offices\nin every major city in Germany, in Israel, wherever there was large concentrations of Jews\nwho needed help with their claims, the United Restitution Office set up an office. In Israel\nwe had one in Tel Aviv and Haifa and Jerusalem and in the United States we had one on the\nWest Coast and in Los Angeles which still exists and in New York which still exists in\nPhiladelphia.

And these offices\nwere there to give assistance to claimants with no down payment a small contingent fee\nwhich enabled the organization to maintain itself funneling hundreds of thousands of claims\nthrough to the German agencies and in Germany we had offices in Frankfurt and Berlin and\nStuttgart and Munich and Cologne, and Mannheim, all around the place where they were\nGerman agencies dealing with these claims, we set up an office with lawyers of our own\nchoice. The heads of office were always Jewish lawyers. We didn't rely on German lawyers\nexcept as subsidiary staff and then we screened them. So, this was a very big operation,\nlargely unheard of. It worked very well, I must say. I set it up around 1951 and I resigned\nfrom that in 1992 or 1993 after about 40 years. In all that time, we dealt with hundreds of\nmillions of dollars and thousands and thousands of claims there was never a trace of any\nscandal of any kind. Not a single client was able to demonstrate -- a few did complain they\ndidn't get enough, but malpractice. We had no malpractice insurance, and we never had any\nindication of anything other than a clean and upright organization which did not satisfy all\nthe clients. Most of them felt they didn't get enough, but some of them did. They\nappreciated it. And it was also a very unique type of operation.

        "Q: Ben, what happened to that original debt?",
        "A: The million marks that I borrowed from the Occupation Funds on authorization of General\nClay? Well, as I told you, I had signed a document promising to repay it out of restitutions\nmonies when the monies came in. It seemed like a fair enough arrangement to avoid having\nto get consent from the Russians and the British and the French. When the money was gone,\nMr. Clay was also gone, General Clay was also gone, and Mr. McCloy was in his place. So,\nI went to see High Commissioner John McCloy. I explained to him, being an honest man,\nthat I had borrowed this million marks against occupation funds, and that I promised to\nrepay, but I said, \"Look, the money is just beginning to come in. There are other priorities.\nI'm trying to move the D.P.s out of the camps in Germany into Israel. In order to do that I\nneed the money to buy prefabricated homes which can be shipped from, at that time\neverything was under strict control, export import controls and I said I need the funds to buy\nthese prefabricated houses in Austria to ship them in Israel. Otherwise we're going to have\nthe camps blocked and all the rest.\" He said, \"All right, all right.\" \"I need some more\nmoney.\" He said, \"How much more do you need?\" I said, \"A million marks.\" He said,\n\"Can I do that legally?\" I said, \"I happen to have memo here that says you can.\" And he\nsaid, \"Okay, go ahead.\" So, I borrowed another million marks. To make a long a story\nshort, when that million marks was gone, it didn't take too long, I came back to him again\nand I said, \"Look, I know that I promised to repay, and that money is coming in, but there are\nother priorities. You shouldn't give priority to repay occupation funds. There are these other\nneeds and I need another million marks and I'll pay them back later.\" And he said, \"All\nright, okay.\" So I signed a third time. I had accumulated three million marks.

Mr. McCloy, in his infinite wisdom or folly, granted clemency to a lot\nof convicted war criminals including my Einsatzgruppen boys, including Alfred Krupp, who\nhad been sentenced to seven years in prison as well as forfeiture of all of his billions of\nassets. I went to see Mr. McCloy. I said, \"Mr. McCloy, I know that I have promised to pay.\nThe debt is now three million marks. If you insist upon repaying it, I will repay it, but you\nhave just given a convicted war criminal three billion marks in assets and I don't think it's\nfair to ask the victims to pay the expenses of recovering a small portion of what was stolen\nfrom them.\" He said, \"What do you want me to do?\" I said, \"I want you to cancel the debt.\"\nHe said, \"Can I do it legally?\" I said, \"I have a memo here that says you can.\" He said,\n\"The debt is canceled.\" That's something about Mr. McCloy the Jewish organizations don't\nknow, some of them do, because I reported on it, of course. But it's not generally known.\nMcCloy was a great friend to the Jews in the whole restitution program. He was very, very\nhelpful in persuading Konrad Adenauer and the German government to be supportive of\nJewish claims at a time when Germany was totally dependent, financially and militarily upon\nthe United States and Mr. McCloy as_ former Assistant Secretary of War and High\nCommissioner of Germany, when he suggested the German leaders, whether it be Adenauer\nor whether it be some of the others that it would be in their interest to be more forthcoming\nin the dealing of Jewish claims, they listened. In one of his speeches he said this would be\nthe test of Germany's morality and their readiness to be rejoined with the family of nations\nwhat they did for the Nazi victims. So, I think that Mr. McCloy deserves recognition for\nwhat he did for the Jews as well as less criticism for his failure to bomb the rail lines in\nAuschwitz, which he thought would not help the Jews, would kill them more likely than not.\nAnd for his judgment in that he was not alone in.

        "Q: Outside of the cases that you've been talking about, were there cases outside of your normal\npurview, like the Catholic women?",
        "A: Yes, there were several. Two major ones come to mind. There were others. One is these\nCatholic women who are victims of medical experiments the other is slave laborers which\nwe might want to spend another minute with. The Catholic women's story is fairly simple.\nThe Germans in the Ravensbriick concentration camp, used young Catholic women, they\ndidn't just select them because they were Catholic, it happened to be that they were Catholic,\nand used them for a variety of rather atrocious medical experiments such as cutting them\nopen and throwing sand and glass at their wounds to see how they would heal and how long\nit would take them before they died. These were experiments designed to simulate the\nconditions which German soldiers might face in various traumatic situations. And Germany\nrefused to pay them anything because there were no diplomatic relations between West\nGermany and the Polish government and one of the defects in the German compensation\nlaws was that it excluded political persecutees, and they excluded anybody from a\ncommunist country. Well, there was a lady by the name of Caroline Faraday who had been\nvery close to a French resistance group which was devout Catholic as well, and she came to\nsee me one day and she said that she heard that I had been so helpful -- I was then practicing\nlaw in New York -- I had come back -- in helping the Jews, why couldn't I do something for\nthe Catholics? And she explained that she had gone to Norman Cousins who was then the\neditor of the Saturday Review.

The women of Hiroshima who had been\ninjured by American blasts, atomic weapons, and who had been disfigured and who were\nbrought to New York where they were treated by Doctor Hitzik, a Jewish doctor, at Mt.\nSinai Hospital and given all kinds of plastic surgery and restored as far as possible as a\ngesture of goodwill from the American public to the Japanese. That has been a very\nsuccessful program in terms of generating goodwill and showing human compassion\nregardless of who the victims are. So, he was well known for that. He himself was a World\nFederalist, later president of the World Federalist Association, and he had important\ninfluence on my world thinking as well. Anyway, Caroline Faraday had gone to see him and\nhe said, \"Look, there is no legal basis for the claim. It's different. It's an involuntary action.\"\nAnd somehow she had found my name and she came to see me. And I agreed to help them.\nWe set up a little committee, Norman was the chairman. We brought in some publicist,\nsomeone from Life magazine and I approached the German government through the\nAmbassador in Washington, and he said, \"We can't pay, as you know. There's no provision\nin the law for it. We have no diplomatic relation with Poland. We're sorry, they have no\nclaims.\" I said it has nothing to do with the law. You injured these people, you owe them.\nAnd you're going to pay them. \"We can't, no basis.\" Well, we'll find a basis. So, we\narranged a high pressure publicity campaign. Pan Am lent us an airplane and we filled it up\nwith these women from Warsaw, young Polish women. We brought them to the United\nStates. I drafted speeches. Norman drafted speeches. Cardinal Spellman greeted them on\nthe steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, the gist of which was \"The women of Poland, we greet\nyou. The Germans are not paying you? How can they do such a terrible thing. After all,\nlook what they did to you.\" And then we took them to the Senate and we took them to the\nCongress, and every Senator who had a Polish voter and came up and made a speech on the\nfloor, and he began, saying \"Look what they did, these Germans, and they refuse to pay\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And I was on the phone every day\nwith the German Ambassador. \"Have you had enough?\" And finally he said, \"I have had\nenough. I'm sending a cable to Bonn. This is not a legal matter, it's a political matter, and\nthey better settle with these women.\" And I proceeded then to Bonn. And the Cabinet was\ntaking this up as a very special measure outside the law. The Cabinet by that time was very,\nvery annoyed with me because I had offices in Germany. I had offices in Bonn. I knew\nwhat they were thinking and what they were doing. And the word that I got from the middle\nof the cabinet meeting was that they are ready to pay, but to pay to you, because they think\nyou are a communist agent and you are just there to embarrass the German government. I\nsaid, \"To whom are they willing to pay? I don't care to whom they pay, they have got to pay\nthe girls. They said, \"Well, I don't know but they're not going to pay to you.\" I said, \"How\nabout the Red Cross?\" They said, \"Oh, yes, the Red Cross they will pay.\" So, the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, and I said, \"Fine, just have them pass a resolution.\nThey'll make payment to the International Committee of the Red Cross. I will be in Geneva\nand I will take it up with the Red Cross.\" And they did. So, off I went to Geneva and there I\nmet with a M. Momaunoir, the International Committee of the Red Cross and I explained the\nsituation. The Germans are willing to pay, but they would only pay it through the Red\nCross, and would the Red Cross be willing to accept this as an obligation. The Red Cross\nwas much smarter than I was. I was ready to settle this with the Germans for I don't\nremember, five million dollars or something like that, because we only had a list that high, of\nmaybe a 100 girls altogether. And in comparison to what the Jews were getting 5,000 marks\na head, it was a symbolic payment. The Red Cross said no we can't accept limited liability.\nWe can't accept a closed ended deal. We will accept the proposition that they will pay. We\nwill certify that they were victims of medical experiments. We will classify them\nclassification A,B,C depending on the gravity of the offense.

Fine, I went back to Bonn, you got a\ndeal, bang, and we made the deal. Special Cabinet resolution. The nice end of the story\nwhich delights me, proves that I was a total fool that I would be willing to accept a\nsettlement for five million dollars. By the time that they got through paying that program, it\nmust have cost them fifty times that much. I would go past a buddy of mine in the Finance\nMinistry and say how many claimants do you have now? We only knew about 100. A\nthousand, 1,200, 1,500 they came from Czechoslovakia, from Poland, from Austria, from\nHungary. All the medical experiment victims came and the Red Cross said that was the deal,\nand they kept on approving them and they kept on getting paid. And the minimum payment,\nI figured out, I arranged that the payments would be made in Swiss franks as well, so it didn't\nget worthless zloty and the people could go abroad in order to get medical treatment. They\ncould spend their money abroad. And the minimum payment was what a college professor\nin Poland would have earned in two years time. So, it was a great thing for these Polish\nwomen, and one of my most touching moments in my whole experience in this business was\na group of them waiting at the airport in Poland to greet me when I came as a guest as the\nPolish government to express their appreciation for my effort. So, that was one of the\ncategories of claims outside of the normal range, and there were many others. The slave\nlabor claims I dealt with in detail in my book Less Than Slaves, which unfortunately is out\nof print now. I hope that Harvard University will be induced by the Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum to print in paperback again, that book which has many useful lessons. It's been\ntranslated into German. It's been translated into Japanese. It's been the basis of a good\ntelevision show, and I would hope that something could be done. There are many others if\nyou shake my memory a little bit.

As I indicated Jewish congregations\nwere state organizations. They were entities of the state, and if a school teacher, an\nelementary school lost his job or stayed long enough, he got a pension. If he was a teacher in\na Hebrew school, he should have been entitled to the same pension. But the Germans said,\nno, no, no we can't do that because we don't know who would have been entitled to a\npension. How should we know now? All the schools were closing in 1933 and whether the\nRabbi or the , or the moyl or the ritual all the people who are involved in\nJewish congregation and religious life, whether they would be eligible for pension, we can't\nknow that. So, I countered. I said, let's make a global settlement for I think it was 30 million\nmarks and then we'll distribute. Oh no, we can't do that. I said, all right we'll make another\ndeal. We will set up an advisory committee to check the claims first and only when we\ncheck it and say that it's okay will we pass it on to you, and you can check it again if you like\nand we will only approve those cases where we think the man would be entitled to a pension.\nThey bought that, much to my relief, much to their regret. Because we then set up small\nadvisory committee of former German Jews mostly, I was the Chairman of that committee,\nand we received of thousands and thousands of applications of people who would have been\nqualified or felt they would have been qualified for a pension from these Jewish\ncongregations. And we approved those cases and we passed them on to the Germans and the\nGermans paid. It was not under the Finance Ministry but under their Social Ministry. The\nMinistry which deals with this type of problem. I say partly to our shame, there were many\ncases where we turned down the claim, and they could appeal to the Germans and the\nGermans approved it, so that although we were correct in our determination of eligibility,\nthere were cases where the Germans felt well, we had turned it down, but the man would\nhave been entitled. For example, a typical type of case would be a rabbi left Germany, fled\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He worked for two years. Was he a career employee of the\ncongregation so that he would have been entitled to the pension, or was he only a temporary\nemployee? Some of the members of my advisory board said, no, no, under no circumstances\nhe should never expected a pension. It was only a temporary thing. I always voted in favor\nof the claimant where the matter was in doubt. If it was a tie vote, I think we were five, if it\nwas two and two, I always cast in favor of the Claimant. But many cases we turned down\nand the Germans said yes, we'll pay them. So that's an example of Jews being overly\ncautious and the Germans being a bit more generous in a completely different category of\ncase outside the normal range of the law, and of course, it cost the Germans very much more\nthan we had originally anticipated in the beginning.",
        "Q: Had you met the Polish women individually prior to that visit to Poland?",
        "A: No, I had not. They had been in the States and they had been paraded around, but I had not\nmet them individually. They came then to the airport to greet me, and then we were\nsupposed to go to the ballet and I didn't want to leave. It was pouring rain and they stayed\nthere with their flowers, and they were all wilted and I said to my host, I don't want to leave\nthese women.

        "Q: Ben, can you talk a little bit about the attitude of the German industrialists when you started\nmaking claims for slave laborers?",
        "A: The German industrialists had a rather unique attitude. They began by denying that it ever\nhappened. The attitude was \"What? We employed concentration camp inmates?\" Next,\nthey denied that they were in any way responsible or connected with it. \"Ah, perhaps they\nwere assigned to us by the SS. It could have been, but the conditions were really very good.\"\nSo they denied the conditions. Then when you pointed out the conditions were really very\nterrible. \"Ah, we were not responsible for that. We did the best we could under difficult\ncircumstances.\" Then the ultimate payoff was \"Well, you know, if it hadn't been for us, they\nwould have gone directly into the gas chamber. So, by our providing work, we saved their\nlives. Why are they complaining to us? They owe us.\" That essentially in summary was the\nattitude of all the industrialist without exception, despite all the denials since that time which\nhave appeared on television and on radio shows and on all kinds of other shows and it was\nthe universal response of all of them, without exception. Now, I had a little incident, my\nknowledge of what had happened came largely from the Nuremberg Trials against I.G.\nFarben which built Auschwitz, against Krupp, a big user of slave labor, against Flick, who\nwas a big industrialist who had many companies using slave labor, armaments firms and\neverything else, automobile companies; and in Nuremberg we had collected the\ndocumentary evidence of this and the documentary evidence showed what the truth was.\nHow many people they employed, where they employed them, what the conditions were,\nhow much they paid the SS for the laborers, 1t was a few Pfennigs, and what they had to do\nin order to qualify to receive inmates. And they showed very clearly to me that you had to\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

You had to be engaged in industry which they\nconsidered important, you had to be sure to provide security either by sending your own\npeople to be trained as SS guards, by the SS to put barbed wire all around the particular plant\nwherever they were working. Post the proper security guards and other security measures to\nbe able to maintain them on the level which was tolerable to the SS, which means minimum\nconsumption, maximum production. Failure to do that is the equivalent of being shot dead\nor treated as a saboteur. So, they had to comply with all that before they could even be\nconsidered for getting labor. I'm not talking about right after the beginning of the war and\npeople were seized on the street and put to work on rubble. I'm talking about regular forced\nslave laborers. And I had all the documentary proof including the decrees from Albert\nSpeer, who was the Minister responsible for the armaments industry and for the allocation of\nlabor. And the industrialist with whom I had met -- LG. Farben, Krupp, AEG, Siemens,\nTelefunken -- all of them took the other line. So when Krupp came out of Spandau Prison\nafter twenty years, now Spandau Prison is in Berlin. It's an old big, 1t doesn't exit any more.\nThey ripped down when Hess, who was the last prisoner who died there. This was a big\nfortress of a prison for these few Nuremberg defendants. And Speer spends twenty years\nthere and every three months they rotate them. Russians the French, the British and the\nAmericans, and the Russians were not kindly deposed to any of those prisoners. He came\nout and I arranged to meet him at the airport in Frankfurt secretly. And it was not easy for\nme to shake hands with Albert Speer. But he spent twenty years and in the interim he had\nwritten several books about his memoirs and in those books and at Nuremberg as well he\nhad indicated remorse for what had happened and was prepared to assume responsibility to a\ncertain extent for having been involved in supporting Hitler's programs knowing very well\nwhat was happening to the Jews and other forced laborers, and there were other forced\nlaborers as well. So, I asked him, I said, \"Look, I have a question. I come to see you with a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I have all your documents, your decrees, I have the requisitions, I have the reports\nfrom the concentration camp commanders. I have reports from the SS people who are\nresponsible for the allocation of labor, and they all tell me one thing, and one thing\nconsistently and only, that all of these industrialists were fighting to get these inmates and\nthe conditions were equivalent to death. They could only survive a given number of months\nin that kind of labor. And that this was known to all of them and yet they all deny it. How\ndo you explain that?\" He said, \"They're lying.\" And I said, \"Can I quote you?\" And he said,\n\"Yes, you may.\" And I wrote the story in the book Less Than Slaves and I sent him a draft\nof the manuscript beforehand. I said \"Mr. Krupp\u201d, is this a correct statement? If so, please\ninform me. If it's wrong, please correct it.\" And he wrote on the margin \"Einverstanden\";\nagreed. He changed nothing. So, that was an interesting thing. And you know when some\nof these fine industrialists representatives of Mr. Krupp and the others were asked about this\nlater, after we made these paltry settlements with them, which I described in the book: \"Oh,\neverything was fine. You know, we had a moral obligation\" and so on. But in truth, they\npaid as little as they could get away with. They didn't pay a penny more than they had to,\nand the real payoff and revealing their true attitude is what they did for the non-Jews. In\nconnection with the I.G. Farben settlement, a certain point in the negotiations the question of\nnon-Jews came up. A gentleman by the name of Langbein, had been a head of the group of\nAuschwitz non-Jewish survivors\u201d. He had been agitating for compensation for them too.\nAnd the I.G. Farben people said we only have a limited pot. We'll pay thirty million marks,\nwe can't afford to pay more. You divide it. So they pitted the Jews against the non-Jews to\ndivide it. And then the argument was what was the ratio in the camp at the time of\nliberation, and when I was in Poland as a guest of the Polish government in connection with\n* Correction: Mr. Speer.\nThe rllowine onan an gbein wa s the head of the Internatig nal Aus chwitz Committee. at not this transcript.

But when it came to the others, they refused to pay.\nAEG, the big electrical company, I met with their representatives in Munich. It's a big\nbeautiful building and we finally reached agreement on a contract, and in the contract they\nsaid, without recognizing any legal or moral responsibility, and I said \"What do you mean,\n\u2018no moral responsibility\u2019? You don't want to recognize any legal responsibility, which is what\nthey all wrote into the contract. If you don't have any moral responsibility, why are you\ndoing it?\" And he said, \"Well, that's the way we want to put it.\" And I said \"Why didn't you\nput down the truth? Why don't you put down that you're doing this because you feel you're\nbeing intimated and blackmailed by the Jews? Write that into the contract and I'll buy that\nand I'll sign that agreement. But without recognizing any legal or moral responsibility, that's\noutrageous. Why do you pay then? It's a lie to begin with.\" And we got into quite a heated\nargument, and my colleague Dr. Ernst Katzenstein\u00ae\u2019, who was more sober than I, a former\nGerman lawyer. an Israeli, a very kind an able man, he calmed me down and we finally\nsigned the contract with that wording 1n there. Because it was very revealing. And when Mr.\nBerthold Beitz, the Generalbevollmachtiger, the general power of attorney of Mr. Krupp,\nwas asked the question on German television why Krupp didn't pay non-Jews, his answer\nwas \"Well, you know, the Jewish lobby was very active, and the non-Jews didn't have that\nkind of a lobby.\" So, it was an honest statement, but it also revealed that the Germans paid\n** Josef Cyrankiewicz was Chairman of the Council of Ministers in Poland from 1947-70.\nThe rollowine Dr. Emst Katzenstein was Fere nez\u2019s successor as direc ine of the JRSO. document, not this transcript.

And for that reason they gave as little as possible. They were\nnot concerned with helping the Jews. They were concerned with helping their companies\nand helping Germany. And they were not concerned with saving the Jews, they were\nconcermed with saving Germany during the war. And the rest of it is boloney, pure and\nsimple, and nobody should believe it.\n[Tape break]\nMay I correct something? I inadvertently misspoke, it was Mr. Speer who was in Spandau prison\nfor twenty years, not Mr. Krupp. Krupp was sentenced for seven years, got out in less time\nand was then allowed to go free with his fortune thanks to Mr. McCloy's generosity. I also\nmade another reference somewhere where I mixed up the names of Speer and Krupp in\nconnection --",

        "A: There were no real problems. We met with Langbein on occasion, but there was no massive\nmovement, because the inmates themselves were unaware that these negotiations were\ntaking place, and in fact when we later distributed these funds, we found very often the\ninmates came and filed claims when in fact they had not worked for that company or did\nwork for that company but not in a plant which was authorized to receive compensation.\nAnd we had to engage on a voluntary basis, persons whom we knew had been there for a\nlong time, and they would form a screening committee and invite the claimants in in\ndoubtful cases and try to confirm that they had actually been there or not been there. And\nthere were many cases where the inmate through error or a moral feeling of what difference\ndoes it make if I worked for Krupp or Schmidt it was the same kind of work in the same\nplace in the same time and the same beatings and the same starvation, why should he get it\nand not I? And morally they were right, but we couldn't do anything about it. That was the\nterms of the contract, so we screened them out, always kindly.

        "A: My feelings expressed at that time have not changed. I am a lawyer. That is all I've ever\nwanted to be. I felt that Nuremberg trial and the Einsatzgruppen case in particular was an\nopportunity and an obligation to advance the rule of law that if it's going to have any\nsignificance, 1t has to have more than merely executing 22 people for murdering a million\npeople. You cannot compare, there was nothing that could be done to these defendants that\nwould expiate in any way the magnitude of a crime of that size and I struggled with that\nproblem as a young man but at that time, because it was expected as the French headlines\nsaid that the prosecutor would come in and say \"I demand their heads. Je vous demande les\ntetes\" 1s what some French papers falsely stated as my opening statement. It was never my\nopening statement nor did I have such feelings. But it had to have some significance, some\npermanent significance otherwise they died for nothing. And the idea of creating a rule of\nlaw where all persons -- when I talk about mankind, I meant womankind as well, we weren't\nas sensitive then as we are now -- where all persons could live in peace and dignity\nregardless of whatever their race or creed might be and that idea remained with me and it\nremained with me until this day. I would say that most of my life, not all of it, was dedicated\nto trying to make that a reality. There's a certain bit of madness in that. One human being\nsets out and says \"Look, let's see what we can do to make this a world in which those\nconditions exist. And when I was about 50 years of age, my kids were already grown, and I\nfelt well, now I can dedicate myself full time because I didn't have to be so concerned about\nsending them off to college and meeting all their expenses and all the rest, and I thought I'll\nfocus now on that. And I began to disassociate from my law practice and devote myself full\ntime. By full time I mean only fifty, sixty hours a week to those goals.

That\nwas my main pitch of my Nuremberg Trial. Crimes Against Humanity, that humankind has\na right to be protected from this kind of slaughter and abuse simply because of your race or\nreligion. And so crimes against humanity was the things that I was interested in and in a\ncourt to condemn such crimes. And there was no court. After Nuremberg and the\nsubsequent trials, there was no such court. Crimes against humanity were committed in\nmany places: in Biafra, in Vietnam and in all kinds of places. Nobody talked about a court.\nNobody talked about punishing the most outrageous crimes. Millions of people were being\nkilled and the international community was looking the other way, including the Jewish\ncommunity, I'm ashamed to say. They didn't care. It was not them, it was somebody else.\nVery little Jewish concern. So I began to work on an International Criminal Court, and the\nUnited Nations was already working on that problem, ever since Nuremberg, but had made\nno progress. And they made no progress because the Nations didn't want it. And they said\nuntil they had a definition of Aggression there was no use in having a court because\nAggression is the biggest of all crimes. And that they had been fooling around with the\ndefinition of aggression for 30 or 40 years with no progress so I decided to work on a\ndefinition of Aggression first to get that out of the way.

        "A: It seemed to me to be a bit absurd that the International Legal community was unable to\ndefine Aggression. I began to work on that problem. When I work on any problem, I do it\nthe same way. I begin from the beginning of time and read and study everything that has\never been written or said, and I began to lobby at the United Nations where there was a\nspecial committee appointed to define Aggression and was going nowhere, and I got access,\nI obtained a pass to the United Nations. I obtained several passes of various kinds and was\nable to go to all of the meetings. And I met with the delegates and I presented papers for\nthem and I coached them and I spoke with them and I lobbied with them and I wrote articles\nin all law reviews and things of that kind. To make a long story short, they finally agreed on\na consensus definition of Aggression. An interesting sidenote, I knew it was coming it was a\nGood Friday, it was 1974, I think, and I came home and I said to Gertrude, tomorrow you\ncome with me to the United Nations. They're going to reach a consensus definition of\nAggression for the first time in 50 years. It will be the legal committee, the Sixth Committee\nof the United Nations Special Committee on Aggression. And I took her there and sure\nenough a few minutes had come and it had already been prepared and we vote upon a\nconsensus definition of Aggression. I said \"Look around you.\" We're in one of these big hall\nof the United Nations. Nobody was there. It was in the evening. The two of us were sitting\nin the rear section of the hall, and I said, \"You see, this entire hall the only two people who\nare not paid to be here are you and me\", and it was a historic occasion. And I immediately a\ntwo volume book on the definition of Aggression which spelled out the background of all of\nthis and this became a classic work on the definition of Aggression. Then I said, now we can\ngo on to the International Criminal Court and that obstacle had been gotten out of the way\nand they began to work on a court and they were getting absolutely nowhere.

This laid\nout the history, the documents, the background the argumentation for it, how you can create\nsuch a court and everything else. That book came out in 1975, right after the definition and\nnobody read the book. Nobody paid any attention to the book. Well, all right, I tell them\nhow to do it they're not interested. How do you enforce international law? So, I wrote a two\nvolume book on that and somebody said, \"Why do you keep writing books in two volumes?\"\nAnd I said, \"Because my typewriter is so high I need something to sit on and I need two\nvolumes.\" And of course that was only a joke. It was in fact all the documentation, all the\nhistory, everything was there. Going back to ancient days, and it was a very useful took and\nthat was what it was intended to be. It was my notebooks. And when I got through with\nthat, still nobody was paying attention. I wrote another book Common Sense Guide to\nWorld Peace. I wrote Planethood. I wrote another book -- I called in the Russians and\ncompared notes with some Russian experts and I kept writing books and articles and going\nto the United Nations and going to all these meetings, keeping abreast of what was going on,\ntrying to influence it, and nothing much was happening. And crimes were being committed\neverywhere and sometimes I thought I had gotten the governments moving in Bangladesh\nwhen thousands of women were being raped, they said they were going to set up a court and\nI was advising them on that. They didn't pay me for it, but I was advising them for it, and\nthen in the end they said let's have reconciliation and forget it. And of course the crimes\ncontinued. Then something very interesting happened. In Yugoslavia, there we had\ngenocide all over again. Before that, we had Saddam Hussien, a clear case of aggression, a\nclear case of all kinds of war crimes, a clear case including rape, pillage, murder,\nenvironmental depredations, which had not been listed as a crime before, but all kinds of\nthings and the international community did nothing.

You have betrayed half a\nmillion young American people who risked their lives to go out into that desert and then you\ndidn't have the courage to follow through and do what was needed to be done in order to\ncreate a more peaceful world or order by punishing those who are responsible for the crimes.\nInstead you're punishing innocent civilian population. Your sanctions starve them. He\ndoesn't go hungry. And I began to scream and television and radio and every place I could\ngo. Not many, because most people are not interested. They're interested in scandal and\nthings of that kind: rock stars, football players. They're not interested in scholars. However,\nalong came Yugoslavia where genocide now called ethnic cleansing got very popular and\nmass rapes got very popular and the United States said we can't get involved. Our fingers\nwere burned in Somalia. We don't want to do what we did in other places, in Lebanon. The\nUnited States government was opposed to an International Court was opposed to doing\nanything, but because of this medium because of television and the opportunity of the public\nto see people get on television and say as I heard one man say, a Serbian soldier, he said:\n\"Yes, I've raped dozens of Muslim women, but then I cut their throats because that's what\nmy commander told me to do.\" And the women of America, God bless them, began to\nscream \"Do something.\" And the U.S. Government for the first time said we have to do\nsomething. What can we do? The Court, let's set up a court. We're not going to send troops.\nLet's set up a court. So they set up a court for Yugoslavia. All crimes in Yugoslavia, limited\nto Yugoslavia and limited to after 1991, which is of course preposterous. It so happened,\nthat when the General Assembly approved the draft statute for that Court, I was in Geneva at\na meeting of the International Law Commission. I'm not a member of that Commission. I\nwas there doing my usual type of lobbying.

We need a permanent international\ncriminal court, and I'm still working on that, because there's this big gap in the international\nlegal order. My latest book, New Legal Foundations for Global Survival: Security Through\nthe Security Council, is a comprehensive bringing together of twenty years of careful\nthought and I share that with the public. All of my royalties I have given away to peace\ngroups. I will not make a penny on that book any more than we did with the book\n\"Planethood\" which was written with Ken Keyes, who incidentally is a quadriplegic and\ntotally ignores it. No penny for him and not a penny for me. That book is out to educate the\npublic on the need for planetary thinking, if we're going to have a peaceful world. There will\nbe no peace for anyone, anywhere until there it peace everywhere and that is my conviction\nand in this last book I tried to lay out the blue print specifically including the security council\nresolutions that are needed in order to achieve that goal. And it is feasible. And it's feasible\nwithout amending the U.N. Charter, and I'm afraid to tear up the U.N. Charter and start\nagain, because I see the anarchy that comes in places like the former Soviet Union and\nYugoslavia, and it's too dangerous. Too many people will die before we can pull the thing\ntogether again. So, I'm ready to try to make it work within its existing framework by\ninterpreting the laws and by laying out new rules to make the Security Council a more\ndemocratic and fairer institution than it is today, and that is the gist of my thinking and of my\nnew book. And now that I am approaching the age of 75, I hope the time will come for me\nto close my book and say this is my effort to create a more humane and more peaceful world\nso all may live in peace and dignity.",

The old lady at the nearby farmhouse told me about seeing the SS herding a\ngroup of weary men into the woods. They were part of the 15,000 who had been marched\nout of Flossenburg concentration camp headed for Dachau as the Americans approached at\nthe end of April. The farmers wife heard the shots as they rang out at brief intervals. The\nfarmer and his sons made sworn statements about how they had covered the bodies with dirt\nin order to prevent disease.\" I took those affidavits from them. \"I sent the photographer to\nthe spot. And here you have the results.\" I must have enclosed pictures. I'm sure I did. I'm\nsure the Holocaust Memorial Museum has those pictures of the bodies that I helped uncover.\n\"Hope they won't scare you, but the pictures can only give a small indication of what\nactually it was like. I just want to get the things off my hands. Use them in any way you\nlike, dear, and I hope they won't keep you awake. Will write a decent letter later. P.S. Just\nin case you can't find that other more detailed letter, these murdered men were political\nprisoners of every nationality and were murdered simply because they appeared to be too\ntired to continue the march successfully. The SS beasts didn't even wait for these men to\nfall, they just marched them into the woods for slaughter.\" These were non-Jews, Jews of\ncourse were included as well. So, on that happy note, I thank you for the opportunity to\nrecord this piece of history and we hope the next world will be a better one.

And there's where my\nearliest recollections begin. From there I went to the New York school system, the public\nschools. My parents were divorced when I was six, so I went out to live with an aunt who\nlived in Brooklyn and that's where I actually started school, because I was too small and I\ncouldn't speak English, so they wouldn't take me at the school until I was seven.

There was a general awareness of the\npersecution of the Jews, for example, and I remember a protest rally which took place in\nMadison Square Garden -- I think my parents went down there -- to protest and call for a\nboycott against Germany for the persecution of the Jews, so we were aware of that.

I think my hatred of the\nAmerican Army may have equalled that of mine for the Germans. I didn't know the\nGermans. But it's the dehumanizing process that takes place in an Army where as part of the\ntraining the first thing you do is take human beings and make robots out of them. And I\nrefused to become a robot and that caused me endless grief in the Army because I was\nalways being reprimanded and sent on KP and I refused to march. And I said that was the\ndumbest thing I ever heard of. I explained to my first sargeant that the reason people march\nis that it went back to Roman times when the soldiers had to carry their shields on the right\nside or the left side or over their head and march in formation because they were being\nattacked by spears from the hills. And if they didn't move in formation the spears could\npenetrate, and kill them, and therefore it was very important that they moved as a unit, and I\nsaid that was very important.

A nice enough Colonel, but he had no\nsuch experience, and I said, \"Sit down Colonel, you're about to get an education.\" And he\nsat down and I explained to him, because by that time I was quite an authority on war\ncrimes. I had done all the research for a book by this Harvard professor Gluck, and I had\nread everything that had been written about War Crimes, the First World War and way back,\nand my job was to make summaries of everything that had been written, all the articles, all\nthe books, and I had a very retentive mind and I knew everything about war crimes.

Anybody who lies will be shot.\"\nAnd they would stand at attention and tremble and sit down and write. And separately, you\nknow, keep them all apart. Then I'd collect the statement and say, \"Now read 'em to me.\"\nAnd they would read them to me, and pretty soon if you read seventy-five statements you get\nforty of them telling you the same thing.

The first\nwar crimes trials, long before Nuremberg, took place in the Dachau concentration camp, on\nthe basis of the evidence collected by me and Nowitz and a few other guys like us who went\nout into the field and collected the evidence. That's before we ran into the concentration\ncamps, of course, that was a bigger operation.",

The trials were already on while I was there,\nbut I left and they were still going on when I came back a long time later, a year or so later,\nand was prosecuting at Nuremberg. Those trials were still going on. To give you some idea\nof the flavor of those trials which I thought were terrible, I thought they were terrible: They\nbore very little resemblance to a normal due process of law and I must confess that I was\npartly guilty and responsible for that kind of behavior. I mean, I, if I had an SS man in my\ncustody and he insisted upon lying that he wasn't even there when I had twenty witnesses\nsaying he was there, he usually ended up with a confession. It was not that I had to shoot him\nthrough the head in order to get it, but he certainly was of the impression that if he continued\nlying I would. And under those circumstances I would always bring in an officer and tell\nhim to go and get that confession again, because the one, the original one, would probably\nnot stand up to close scrutiny. But the trials themselves at Dachau were, the judges were\nofficers with no legal training, usually, who had no better assignment. The procedures were\nvery informal. I'm not suggesting that we tried and punished innocent people: on the\ncontrary, they were all guilty as hell, otherwise you wouldn't have tried them in the first\nplace.

Now sometimes the Colonel would say \"Oh no --\" I said \"Listen, you want\nme to call up Patton directly? If you do, I will. And he'll straighten you out!\" And I had no\nrespect whatsoever for military authority. I had nothing but contempt. The higher the rank,\nthe more contempt! And it invariably worked very well.

A report would come in to 3rd Army\nheadquarters that so-and-so tank division is approaching an area in which they believe there\nis a concentration camp or has just overrun an area in which there is a concentration camp,\nand the conditions are horrible, et cetera, and that would come to me, the report would come\nto me, and I'd say I am going out into the field to investigate that. Later on we had others\nwho would go out into the field, but I was very eager to go out, and because I was the most\nexperienced man in the outfit and nobody else knew what to do, in fact, I would go out. And\ngoing out meant I'd get there as fast I possibly could, usually on a Jeep, find out which unit\nwas going in or had just entered, and go on into the camp. And what I would do immediately\nwould be to secure the records. There was in every camp a Schreibstube, or an office. I'd go\ninto the Schreibstube and immediatly beschlagnahm\u2019 the Schreibstube which means you'd\nseize, I'd seize the Schreibstube and everything in 1t. Nobody could in, nobody out. All\nrecords are confiscated and secured. For example, in Buchenwald, I siezed the Totenbiicher,\nthe death books, which were the registries of the people killed in Buchenwald. There were\nlong big black books, bound, there were not the loose leaf folders, but there they recorded\nthe name of all the inmates as they were killed, and they would put down next to them the\ndate, the name, the date of birth, usually, if they had it of the inmate, and his number, of\ncourse, then the reason for his death, and they were all so obviously fictitious. \"Auf der\nFlucht erschossen\" -- \"shot while trying to escape\" or \"Typhus\" -- \"typhoid\" or other\ndiseases. Those books then became the basic evidence for what had happened in the camp\nand who was there. Then I would follow that up by bringing in witnesses from the survivors\nto take statements from them describing what had happened in the camp.

As soon as I secured the evidence in a camp and I heard\nthere was another camp someplace else, I raced off to the other camp because if you did't do\nthat, everything was destroyed. The American Army, for one, would come in and destroy\neverything they could, and the inmates themelves tore everything apart. So I was moving\nfrom one camp to another -- Buchenwald: I didn't remember the name Buchenwald at the\ntime. I remember Ohrdruf because we took pictures at Ohrdruf and these additional slave\nlabor camps all around the main camps -- there were many of them. So I would go from one\ncamp to the next -- Ebensee, Mauthausen, Flossenburg, Ohrdruf, these are names that I recall\nand that come to mind. Sometimes I knew it at the time, usually I didn't, I jut knew it was a\nconcentration camp. And in one of those camps -- it may have been Buchenwald but I don't\nthink so, it was probably Ebensee or Flossenbirg, or it wasn't Mauthausen, it was too big --\none of the inmates in the Schreibstube came to me as soon as I came in and he said, \"I have\nbeen waiting for you\" and I said, \"What for?\" He said, \"Come with me\" and he took a\nshovel and he took me out of the room, which was their office, and we walked away into the\ncamp next to the electric fence which was part of the surrounding barbed wire, and there he\ndug a hole; I remember it was right near the post of the fence. And he dug a hole with the\nshovel and took out a bundle. It was a box wrapped in what looked like rags. And he said,\n\"Let's go back to the office.\" I went back to the office and he opened this.

And I always marvelled in later years\nwhen I'd meet people whom I didn't recognize, of course, but I knew they'd been through that\nand they seemed to be quite normal. I knew that the couldn't be quite normal but if you\ntouch some spark, you know some spot, the crack shows. But this whole process of what\nhappened to human beings struck me as more terrible than people who were on the verge of\ndeath or who were dying out of starvation or disease and so on. In other camps like\nMauthausen -- I remember Mauthausen very vividly, because it was a very big camp and I\ngot in very early, and it was a terrible Vernichtungslager\u2019, really, where they were killing\npeople by throwing them off the cliff into the quarry down below. Gusen I and Gusen IP and\nof course the mass graves everywhere. And I, there was typhus in the camp and I couldn't\nspend the night there, I had to get out of the camp as fast as I could, I did my work and got\nout, I wouldn't spend the night there; and dysentery, people lying around in their own filth\nand excrement; you know one on top of the other, in the bunks you know, one on top of the\nother -- three, four, five in a bunk, maybe somebody above, and everybody sick, you know\nthrowing up, blowing at both ends; and the stench and the disease and the despair --\nsomebody holding up a hand for a glass of water or a drink, or something like that. So, it's\nreally quite unimaginable to a normal mind. And that people could subject other people to\nthat kind of treatment is something I will never recover from.

        "A: Not to get away from the scene. The work was so overwhelming that I never faltered in the\njob, I never felt that I had to stop because I couldn't carry on. I carried on very well, and it\nwas though I just built a wall to cut it out, you know, and just to go ahead and do what had to\nbe done and don't let it impact on your emotional response to it. So I left the camps because\nconditions were such that it was dangerous to stay but only after I'd done what I had to do.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, there were many of them who were, and in fact that's where I used...those\nwere ones from whom I collected statements immediately. You know, some of them were in\nfairly good shape and they were in such good shape that they went chasing after the SS. I\ndescribed in one of my letters a scene of an SS man trying to escape being murdered by the\nprisoners who were chasing him, and he wanted me to take him prisoner. And he had a\ncivilian jacket on, he put the civilian jacket on in an attempt to escape and he jumped on the\njeep and said, \"Please take me prisoner.\" I don't remember any more if he was speaking\nGerman or English, any more, probably German. I said, \"Show me your papers,\" and he\nshowed me his papers, and I could see he was an SS man. I said, \"These are not your\npapers.\" They were not his; they were some other papers he'd picked up somewhere. I said,\n\"I don't take civilian prisoners\" and pushed him off. And at that point these two who looked\nlike Russians, inmates, came across the hill on a bicycle and they had rifles strapped over\ntheir back and they took their rifle out and he saw them coming in and he ran in front of my\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

There were troops moving up to the front -- trucks and so on --and just as he ran in\nfront of the Jeep, one of the men, the inmates shot him in the back and he fell in front of this\ntruck, which hit him and sent him flying to the side of the road. And the truck driver,\njumped out, a GI, and he said, \"I don't know what happened, he jumped in front of the\ntruck.\" And I just said, \"Keep on moving soldier. Get on.\" You know, and I rolled him into\nthe ditch. So there was an upsurge of the inmates themselves on a rampage. As soon as\nthose gates were opened, they went on a rampage and any German who was within reach,\nrued the day, you know they stripped their homes, they raped their women, they burned the\nhouses down you know. So there were many who were quite capable of still working and\nthinking and talking, and those who seemed to be knowledgeable and better educated, I tried\nto catch them immediately and have them give me a statement you know, what had\nhappened, where they came from, describe who was in the camp, what the circumstances\nwere, describing some of the torture mechanisms which existed in some of these camps --\nchains, and walls against which they shot people, and people were thrown on the wires and\nall that. So there was an ample field for credible reliable testimony from the inmates\nthemselves, and I collected those wherever I could.",
        "A: Well, it depends on how weak they were. A person who could hardly lift their head had no\nfeeling of revenge. These two -- I think they were Soviet POWs in the camp -- they were not\nthat weak, they wanted to kill as many Germans as they could get a hold of, and they did.\nAnd I've seen them beating inmates to death, burning them alive -- well, you know, it was a\nvery gory business.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: No, beating guards. They caught the guards, they caught the camp commandant, beat them\nup not to kill them but because they wanted to burn them alive, and they did. I suppose as a\nsoldier I might have tried to stop them but I was usually alone, and you know the troops and\ntanks had come and gone, passed on ahead, and those who had been able to flee, the SS\nofficers, they fled as fast as they could, but the guards that got caught were seized by the\ninmates, and taken care of.

No. I mean except perhaps in\ncombat, I mean if they were fired at when entering a camp I'm sure they fired back, and I'm\nsure there were casualties in any such exchange.

        "A: Oh yes. There were many women, and there were little children, which surprised me too.\nAnd there were young boys. The boys were usually abused by the SS guards, homosexuals\nand others, in exchange for favors in the camp. And there were little children who were born\nin the camp and were somehow concealed by the mothers in different places and, you know,\nin these slave labor camps surrounding -- there was a whole network right outside the main\ncamp. Different distances, whatever they were able to do by way of work, and sometimes\nthe very small children were put to work on doing things -- curling wires and doing and\nthings where a little hand was better than a big one. So and it--remarkable that they surrived.\nThere were gypsies as well who survived and they were also marked for total extermination.\nBut very soon you'd see a gypsy with a wagon and a horse, which of course he had\nrequisitioned somewhere, \"liberated\" as they called it.",

        "A: Jack Nowitz is doing the same thing some place else, and we'd get home together and meet\nat the office and say, \"Where have you been?\" And he'd say, \"Well, I've been down so-and-\nso, where have you been?\" \"I've been so-and-so.\" Occasionally we'd go out together, on a\njob you know of some kind, and \"you cover this and I'll cover that.\" And then we'd come\nback to our office so-called. This was the Third Army Judge Advocate headquarters, which\nkept moving as this front kept moving up. It was either in Erlangen or it was in Munich or it\nwas someplace else, and yo know we usually took over a German Kasern\u2019 and we had a\nroom and a desk and a typewriter.

That was\nthe objective, and that's what we did. And there were very few of us doing that. Nowitz was\none, I was one, and later we got a few more people in, but the total number was never more\nthan half a dozen or a dozen, who were competent to know what represented a war crime\nand to prepare a report which would stand up in a court of law.

        "A: Well, there are so many memories it's hard to know where to begin, but one thing that comes\nto mind which struck me particularly at the ttme was the May First, the May Day celebration\nin one of the concentration camps, I think it was Ebensee\u00ae, where the inmates were\ncelebrating their liberation and the May Day. It was organized by the Communists who\nwere in charge of most of the camps immediately after liberation. They were the best\norganized. There was a big tribune with Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill and there were\ngoing to be big speeches, but first there was going to be a parade of the inmates and they\nwere broken down in national groups. The Russians marched with a red banner, and the\nFrench and the Italians and the Yugoslavs and the Romanians and the Hungarians. And then\nthere was a group marching along, a bedraggled group, and they had no flag. And I asked\none of the inmates, \"Who are they?\" And they said, \"Oh, those are the Jews.\" I said, \"Why\ndon't they march with you?\" And he said, \"No, no, the Jews, they're separate, that's not us,\nthose are the Jews.\" So there was the antisemitism still in the camp after liberation as a\nreflection, you know, of the ethnic hostility which we see today in many parts of the world\nstill. And another event which strikes me as perhaps noteworthy is that as the camps were\nabout to be liberated, the Germans tried to move the inmates out, those who were still able to\nwalk or to work. They left those behind to be killed or to die who were too sick. But they\nmarched them out, and they were marching I think it was from Flossenbiirg to march to\nDachau or one of the camps. They took them through the woods and they marched at night,\nThe rolowind subeamne et met ha a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I was able to follow this trail\nthrough the woods of mass graves -- 10, 20, 30, 50 killed, you know. And I would get the\nnearest farmer to say, \"Dig them up.\" They would say, \"Oh yes, we heard firing there last\nnight, there was shooting going on,\" \"Where was it?\" \"Over there in the woods.\" And I\nwould say, \"Let's go\" and we would go out into the woods and there would be a newly dug-\nup place and I'd say, \"get some shovels\" and I'd stop some Germans on the street, \"take these\nshovels, dig 'em up\" and we'd dig up the bodies of people who'd obviously been shot through\nthe head; usually the top of the skull blown off, shot probably kneeling from the back, some\nof them were tied still; just lightly covered over with six inches of dirt, something like that.\nSo I could follow the trail of crime being committed all along the way. There was nothing\nyou could do, I mean we were trying to overtake the column; which by that time they'd\nalready been liberated up ahead and some other unit had taken over. And one of the\ndifficulties, I remember as an American soldier, to resist the temptation to try to feed some of\nthese people. We all carried emergency rations of chocolate bars, which were like a brick:\nyou know we carried it in our gunbelt, in case you got into a jam you could hit it with a\nbayonet and break off a piece and survive that way. But if we gave it to an inmate it was\nliable to kill them; and it happened, a lot of the GIs were giving away whatever they had. I\nonce had a can, a case of sardines I'd liberated somewhere and gave it out to the inmates; that\nwas my first reminder I mustn't do that because it would kill them, if they ate a can of\nsardines it would kill 'em. You had to begin by feeding them soup for a week, begin with a\nvery light soup until their stomachs and systems were built up. So, you know, it's hard for\nme, where do I draw the line? I remember the Ebensee concentration camp, I'm quite sure it\nwas Ebensee, too; there were mass bodies everywhere and we had to bury them right away\nbecause of the disease. And we buried them outside the camp in slit trenches. We had\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

A few years later I came back with one of my employees, Dr. Katzerstein, who\nbecame a key man in one of the organizations set up to help Nazi victims. And his wife\ndidn't know why we were in Germany and I said, \"I'll show you why\" and I took them on a\ntour of some of these camps. And we got to Ebensee and there they were all neatly marked\ngraves with crosses on them, you know, and I said, \"That's a lot of baloney because I know, I\nwas here when they were being buried and have pictures of me walking past this so-called\ncemetery.\" Well, they found names of inmates who had died in the camp and just put a\nmarker on, which I suppose is all they could do. But, it was a nightmarish world and there's\nsomething very surrealistic about it and bears very little reality to what the normal human\nbeing would understand, even.",
        "A: No, no, it was real liberation, that was not the primary goal. The troops were moving\nforward and they stumbled upon many of these camps, they didn't know they were there.

        "A: Now the higher headquarters have got to decide what to do about war crimes trials. The\nPresident has declared we're going to have war crimes trials. Hitler and his henchmen had\nbeen put on notice that they'll be held accountable for the concentration camps and whatever\nelse they did. The governments had to act. They were not yet ready to act, the War had just\nended. The Army already had these records, we were all ready, we had the prisoners, we\nhad to do something with them. And in 3rd Army...there was a 12th Army Corps group\nheadquarters, in Wiesbaden I think, they wanted me to come and work with them, I\nremember that; I got a letter from the General asking me if I wanted to be transferred to his\nheadquarters -- it may have been Colonel Denson\u201d who dealt with that, and I said, \"Listen: I\ndon't want to do his work any more than I want to do yours, I want to get out of the Army,\nthat's all I want.

They're\nnot to be confused with what happened later at the International Military Tribunal at\nNuremberg, which was an international court. These were military-style tribunals which\nhave existed under the laws of war for a very long time and they were staffed by military\nofficers similar to a court martial, it followed the court martial procedure. So they would\nhave three officers, a colonel, a major or a captain, whatever; the highest-ranking was the\npresiding officer, the prosecutors were selected by the Judge Advocate group and they may\nor may not have been lawyers, sometimes they were, sometimes they weren't, they were a\nlieutenant assigned to defend So-and-So or to prosecute So-and-So as they would a soldier\nwho had gone AWOL. Then we had all these nice reports prepared by me, Nowitz, by a few\nother guys, Slotnick (ph) was another lawyer who came on board, and we had a fellow\nnamed Briggs who was a lawyer went up to Boston; these were enlisted men and they did all\nthe work. And they had these reports, and based on those reports we would draw up the\nindictment. I would draw up the indictment. And the indictment would say that SS Major\nSo-and-So is indicted for mass murder of so many concentration camp inmates at such-and-\nsuch camp during such-and-such period when he was in command. And the evidence is:\nphotographs obtained by the Signal Corps, statements from the survivors, my own affidavit\nor other affidavits from witnesses who were there -- usually not my own, I would certify as\nto the procedures whereby these affidavits were obtained. And on the basis of that, the\ndefendant would be asked, \"How do you plead?\" And they'd say \"I plead not guilty;\" all\nright, let's proceed with the trial. And they proceeded with the trial. And some of these were\nquite interesting. For example: if you're telling stories: I arrested a woman in the town of\nGrossgerau (ph) which is near Frankfurt. It was a typical Allied flyer case. The typical\nAllied flyer is that any Allied flyer coming down under orders from Hitler was to be killed as\na war criminal; he was to be taken into custody and killed, that was the orders from Berlin.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Eventually he was taken by I think it was a fireman or an SS\nman and they split his head with a crowbar and killed him. I knew who that was and and I\ngot a hold of him, too. But anyway, one of these women was beating this guy on the head\nwith a shoe and I think it was her mother who testified against her. She said, \"I told my\ndaughter not to do that.\" I said, \"What's your daughter's name?\" \"Her name is So-and-So.\"\n\"Where is your daughter now?\" \"The daughter is So-and-So\" and I got a hold of the\ndaughter and I said, \"You were beating those fliers with a shoe.\" \"Who, me? Not me.\"\n\"Don't tell me not you, Lady, because I know it was you. It was your red shoe -- you've got a\nred shoe? You beat him on the head with a red shoe, with the heel of the red shoe.\" \"Yeah,\nwell, that's true but you know, it had just been bombed, my town, I lost my children, my\nhusband was killed\" -- she gives me big sob story, some of which may have been true. And\nshe was quite an attractive woman too, and a young woman, and I thought, well look, I got\nthe guy who split his head and the whole mob was beating him up; I put her under house\narrest, I didn't want to bother with, you know, interring her. When that trial came up at\nDachau, I happened to be there, and one of the guys said, \"You handled the Grossgerau case,\ndidn't you.\" I said \"Yes.\" \"Well, we've got the trial on.\" \"Well, I'll go over and take a look.\"\nAnd sure enough, I spot this lady there and I spot the guy who did the job. At a certain point\nin the trial-- this trial did't last long, it lasted a day or two and that was it -- this woman\nfainted in the dock.

There were very few indictments, and fewer trials and few of\nwhich had any significance. These were based on military pattern of military trials against\nAmerican soldiers for violating the rules of the military code in one way or another. That\nwas the closest analogy to it. They had no significance in international law, they had no\npolitical significance, really.

        "A: I got out of the Army. Great day of my life! I was so eager to get away from Germany I\nnever wanted to hear the name \"German\" again or \"Germany\" again or \"camps\" again or\n\"Army\" of any kind again. And home I went. I was home for a few weeks and I got a\ntelegram asking me to come to Washington. \"Dear Sir: Please, at our expense, would you\nkindly come to Washington and we would like to talk to you.\" Signed by a Colonel Mickey\nMarcus. Mickey Marcus later became quite renowned as a Jewish general, a West Pointer,\nwho went to fight in the Israeli Army, and unfortunately he was killed there, but he was\nrecruiting for the War Crimes Trials, which were then being set up at Nuremberg. He had\nsomehow gotten wind of what I had been doing at Dachau and I was one of the few people\nwho was qualified by legal training to understand war crimes and by experience in the field\nas an active war crimes investigator who was also involved in setting up the trials. So his job\n--Colonel Marcus's job -- was to recruit staff for -- originally he wanted me to go back to\nDachau trials but he was working out of the Pentagon and I went to see him. I had never met\nhim before and he said, \"Benny, we want you to go back to Germany.\" I said, \"Sir, you want\nme to go back to Germany?\" He said, \"Yes! We need guys like you. You understand those\nbastards and, you know, you're going to go back there and, you know, we need you.\" I said,\n\"In order to get me into the Army to go back to Germany, you have to declare war on\nGermany again and be losing.\" I said, \"Otherwise, I don't go back into the Army no how.\"\nSo he said, \"Look, you can't do this, we need you now desperately.\" All these years they\ndidn't need ne at all. He said, \"You know the field and, you know, you've got the right\nattitude, you've got the right experience and so on.\" And he said: \"You name your terms.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

This is my chance!\" I said, \"I'll let you know.\" So I went out and I\ntelephoned to the young lady, Gertrude, who'd been waiting patiently for ten years, and I\nsaid, \"Gertrude, how would you like to go to Europe for a honeymoon?\" She said, \"Oh, this\nis so sudden.\" I explained the situation and she said it would be great. I said, \"I'm going to\ntake the job for six months. We're going to go back and we're going to have a honeymoon,\nand I'm just going to stick it to all these lieutenant colonels who've been sticking it to me all\nthese years.\" So I go back to Marcus and say, \"I'll take the job for six months as a civilian\nwith the rank of a full colonel.\" He said, \"You've got a deal.\" \"OK, draw up the papers.\"\nThen I got intercepted by a call from -- also then a colonel -- Telford Taylor'\u2019, would I come\nand talk to him. He said, \"Look: I'm going back to Nuremberg, I've been over there, the\nInternational Military Tribunal is already in process, Justice Jackson'\u2019 is there, we're\nwinding up that trial but I'm going to take over after him and we're going to set up a whole\nseries of subsequent trials.

I said, \"Marcus, I'm\noff that Army junket, I'm going out with Telford Taylor.\" And so I did -- still intending to\nhave nothing but a good time and enjoy myself and get even with the U.S. Army. Well, it\nturned out that Telford was an excellent lawyer, and he was much engrossed in the whole\nproblem of who do you try when you've tried these two leading Germans when you have the\nentire hierarchy of German life also responsible?? The ministries, the industrialists, the\ngenerals, the SS people, the doctors, the lawyers -- all of them conspired together to make it\npossible for Hitler to do what he was doing. And Telford's approach was we have to reach\nout into all these segments of German society in order to demonstrate how it really worked.\nAnd it was quite fascinating and I really took the work quite seriously, and I said, \"All right.\"\nHe said, \"What do you want me to do? Where do I begin? Where do I go??\" I said, \"We've\ngot to get the evidence.\" I said, \"I'll go to Berlin, that's where all the evidence is.\" So he\nsaid, \"You go to Berlin, set up an office in Berlin.\" So I went to Berlin; my wife I had to\nleave behind. There I set up the officer of Chief of Counsel for War Crimes, Berlin Branch.\nAnd to show you how things worked and how my Army training stood me in good stead: the\nfirst office to which they assigned me was in the cellar of a building -- it was Harnack Haus,\na famous house in Berlin -- and on the floor I found a picture of President Truman, it was\nlying 1n the dirt, no frame. So I got somebody, I said, \"Get me a picture frame.\" So I got it, I\nput the picture in, and I wrote on it, \"To my friend Benny, from Harry\" and I put it on the\nwall. Now, you know, I have a friend named Harry Friedman, he could have given me that\npicture. Then I called up the commanding colonel of Berlin and said, \"I'd like to talk to you,\nColonel, how soon can you get over here to my office?\" He said, \"Who is this calling?\" I\nsaid, \"This is Mr. Ferencz, I'm here on assignment from the President of the United States to\ncarry on a war crimes commmission on behalf of the United States Government and my\noffice 1s in Harnack Haus, I want you to come over right away.\" \"Yes, sir.\" OK, he came\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Look at this, we have\nfive or six rotten rooms here, in a cellar, we need proper quarters. How are we going to get\nour job done?\" He looks at the picture of Truman on the wall and says, \"Yes sir, yes sir\" and\nimmediately got a whole building--a half of a building right next to General Clay's\nheadquarters'*. And of course then we brought in staff, and we had a staff of about 50\npeople. What we did, we scoured all of the German archives. Most of the staff were\nGerman-speaking, former refugees, many of them Jewish who had fled Hitler, who knew the\nGerman scene, and we had the German Foreign Office archives, we had eight or nine million\nNazi Party records in a bunker under a little chateau in Dahlem in the woods; and underneath\nwere these tremendous Nazi Party files and the SS was there, the Gestapo was there, and so\non. So we sent this crew out to scour these for incriminating evidence and outlined exactly\nwhat evidence we were looking for -- murder, crime, devastation without military necessity,\nrape, burning, destruction, racial; you know, we didn't use the word \"genocide\" in those days\nbut, they were already trained. I was briefed and filled out a form which they had to fill out\nwhat all the documents what related to the crime we were trying to prove. Because two\nthings were necessary -- and this is important, and the public doesn't know it: In order to\nhave a successful war crimes prosecution, you need one, evidence beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that specific known crimes have been committed; two, you need the defendants. If\nyou haven't got both together at the same time, you've got nothing. And to bring the two\ntogether was was not easy. You had the evidence but you didn't have the man, he was in\nArgentina somewhere; you had the man, you didn't have the evidence. You knew he was\nguilty as hell but you didn't have the evidence; you knew it from his position, you didn't have\nit.

And we were under great time pressure, which is often forgotten -- we had to\ndo this on a limited budget, with a fixed period of time, because the political scene was\nchanging and we wanted to get these trials over with. The prosecutors were like me or even\nworse, because I knew very little about Germany, well, I didn't even know the language\nproperly at the time. And the others who came in, from Mississippi, Arkansas, wherever,\nthey had...some hadn't the foggiest idea where Germany was! They were sent because they\nhad a Senator friend who wanted to get rid of him, or get him a job or whatever it was. So\nwe had a very mixed crew of prosecutors to decide who was to be tried and on the basis of\nwhich evidence. So this process began between Berlin, primarily, and Nuremberg, of\ncoordination between the two, and it was in that context that this plane was flying back and\nforth and we had to parachute out of one of them with Telford Taylor and his wife and so on\n-- but that's another story. And also we sent out crews to various parts of Vienna, wherever\nthe Nazis were, and information came in; and Justice Jackson had collected a tremendous\namount of information in Paris from captured Nazi archives. So our job was to sort out this\ntremendous...by tremendous, I mean all the German records -- and the Germans are terrific at\nrecords, they keep everything in a hundred copies, except the secret ones [which] they\ndestroyed; the Einsatzgruppen reports, we only found one copy. And to put all this together,\nand understand them, and see how it fits in; and this to be done by a group of inexperienced\nyoung American lawyers who knew really very little of anything of what really happened.\nSo that's the job that we had, and therefore we went about that.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: The time between -- we opened the Berlin branch and the time the first trial went on I don't\nremember specifically now but I would guess we had three months? Something like that\nbefore the first, the first was the Doctors Trial; three or four months, something like that.\nAnd ready to go to trial and submit all the evidence to the accused. Let me say a word about\nthe fairness of the Nuremberg Trials, because there's been a lot of misunderstanding about\nthat. Justice Jackson dealt with it, the International Military Tribunal, which was the court\nwith the Russians, and the French, and the British and the Americans also dealt with it. It's\ntrue: 1t was a trial of the victors only against the vanquished only; we didn't try Americans at\nNuremberg. And that has subjected us to, I think, justified criticism. But the reason for the\ncriticism is that such trials are tainted and it's very difficult to have a fair trial. We tried very\nhard, and I think succeeded, 1n overcoming that taint by being very careful to make sure that\nthe Trials were absolutely fair, and they were. Now, you've heard my criticism of the Army\ntrials as a joke. The Nuremberg Trials were not a joke, nor were they \"unfair trials.\" They\nwere absolutely fair trials. I wrote an article in the American Journal of Criminal Law and\nCriminology on the fairness of the Nuremberg Trials. And as clear evidence that it was fair,\nwe gave the defendants all the evidence which we intended to use against them at least 30\ndays before trial. The courtroom was open to the public, including the German public,\neverything was recorded in English and in German, the records were available to anybody\nwho wanted to read them; the judgments were read in open court; the defendants were all\nrepresented by counsel of their own choice, which very often was excellent former Nazi\nlawyers. They had the kind of a trial which, as Jackson said, they in the days of their pomp\nand power never gave to any man. So although the Nuremberg Trial had to take a step\nforward in some directions to develop international criminal law, and although they were\ntrials by the victors, and although some of the victors themselves came with dirty hands,\nnevertheless there was no excuse for the accused. The fact that a member of the jury was\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

So the trials were very\nfair trials, and my experience with those trials, as I think a person can be objective about it, is\nthat they were the biggest advance in international criminal law that had ever been taken to\nthat time.",
        "A: I sat...well, I was in Berlin working, collecting the evidence and running the office. It was a\nbig office with a lot of things going on. There was...the Einsatzgruppen records, for example,\nwere found in the burnt-out Gestapo headquarters in the basement. One copy out of a\nhundred mimeographed copies at that time were recounting chronologically the murders in\nall the towns by these special extermination squads -- you cannot even translate the words\n\"Emsatzgruppen,\" you had to have staff to do that, to organize them and to and make sure we\nhad a trial. In fact, we were not scheduling an Einsatzgruppen trial; we had trials against the\nhigh command, we had trials against some SS officers, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt but we\nhadn't planned an Einsatzgruppen trial. One of my researchers came in with these Leitz\nfolders, three or four of them, with all these daily reports from the front: how many Jews\nthey'd killed in which towns, and the reports would read, you know, \"Today we entered the\ntown of So-and-So. Within the first 24 hours we succeeded in eliminating\" -- they never,\nalways used euphemisms -- \"in eliminating 14,312 Jews, 127 Communist officials, 816\nGypsies\" and they would list them, you know. And they sent that off to Berlin. They were\nthen consolidated from all these units in the field and issue, as a report, an issue to all the\nhighest echelons of German government, those who said they'd never heard of it and didn't\nknow -- the Foreign Office, the Finance Ministry, all the ministries were getting copies of\nthese reports. Anyway, this researcher found this and he came in and gave it to me. I looked\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He had to decide on what was going to be tried. And he said, \"This 1s\nterrific, where can we use it?\" I said, \"Well, look, it's enough for a separate trial by itself.\nLook, here we've got the names of all the commanding officers. There were 3,000 men there,\nwe have four big commandos, Einsatzgruppen A, B, C, D and each one with ten or twelve\ndifferent units under them.\" He said, \"We don't have staff any more for that.\" I said,\n\"You've got to make staff.\" He said, \"Well, maybe we can pull somebody off from\nsomebody else.\" I said, \"Well, whom have you got? Somebody's got to do it.\" He said,\n\"Well, could you do it?\" I said, \"Sure I could do it. Why can't I do it?\" \"Well, you've got\nyour other job, you've got to do it in addition to your other job.\" I said, \"I'll do them, I've got\nit all lined up.\" He said, \"If you want it you've got it.\" So I became then the chief\nprosecutor for the United States in what the United Press called \"the biggest murder trial in\nhistory\" -- 22 defendants convicted of murdering over a million people, mostly Jews. I was\n27. So that's how the War Crimes trials were planned. Let me add another interesting point.\nThere were 22 defendants. There were 3,000 German officers and men who were engaged\nfor at least a period of two years in doing nothing else but killing Jews and others who were\nperceived to be enemies of the Reich. We tried 22. And the reason we tried 22 was because\nwe only had 22 seats in the dock. If we'd had 21, we'd have tried 21. We knew it was only\na small sampling of those responsible for mass murder on a daily basis. But that's all that we\ncould do under the circumstances, and our option was to do notbing or to do that much. And\nwe did, and we established the record. We did not punish all the guilty. Those 22 were\nconvicted, 13 of them were sentenced to death by Judge Michael Musmanno\u2019\u201d of the\n\u2018Michael Musmanno was the Presiding Judge at the Nuremberg Trial of U.S. vs. Ohlendorf (The\nEinsatzgruppen Trial).

        "A: You know, I had a \u2014a problem. I had the documentary evidence chronicling specifically\nwhich units killed how many people, what types of people, in which towns. I had very little staff.\nI was the chief prosecutor, I had three assistants. The defendants, 22 defendants were entitled to\nhave one or two defense lawyers of their choice; the best Nazis money could buy, and they were\nvery good. I decided that I was going to prosecute the case, without calling a single witness. And\nthe reason I did that was because the documentary evidence spoke for itself; it was absolutely\nreliable. It was their reports from the front. At that time, I could have had available a thousand\nwitnesses, any one of whom would have come in and sworn under oath that that particular\ndefendant murdered his mother, his father, his children, and that he witnessed it. I would have no\ntrouble whatsoever. Not that they would all be lying, but that\u2019s the way they felt. And the DP\ncamps were all around me in Nuremberg, they were all \u2014 Munich, everywhere, there were DP\ncamps. And I was in and out of the camps and \u2014 and I decided I wasn\u2019t going to do that, because\nthey would not be telling the truth, they would not be credible witnesses. Their own emotions\nwould be such that their memory would be distorted, and their testimony would be vulnerable.\nSo I decided to go to trial on the documents alone. Never had happened at Nuremberg. And I\ngave the defendants all of my records, these hor \u2014 reports 30 days before trial, and I said, prepare\nyour defense. When I opened the trial, immediately of course, they challenged the validity of the\ndocuments. Oh, they are fake, they are forgeries, the Russians have fabricated them.

He was put\non the stand to testify that he\u2019d been responsible, they\u2019d been put in a sack, locked \u2014 put under\nlock and key and he\u2019d guarded them all the time, and where they were found, and how they were\nfound, identification so and so. Very soon it was clear they were not going to get away with that\nexcuse. And after three days, I rested my case. These are the defendants, that\u2019s the man\nOhlendorf, that\u2019s his report, dated such and such, which says we killed 90,000 Jews as of this\ntime. There\u2019s the defendant, that\u2019s the charge. They killed 90,000 Jews, and so reported on this\nand this date. I don\u2019t need any more evidence, that\u2019s it. And I went down the list. In three days I\nrested the case. No trial at Nuremberg \u2014 anywhere, had been done with such speed, and such\neconomy of means as General Clay or somebody else said to me. Then the fun began. You never\nsaw such a pack of lies as these guys brought out. If the report said, on July 12\", 1941,\nEinsatzkommando 10-A, of which I was the commanding officer, killed 3,412 people \u2014 Jews, the\ncommander said, well you know that\u2019s with my kommando, but on that day, I happened to be at\nmy grandmother\u2019s funeral in Berlin. And I show you, here 1s a report from the funeral parlor,\nfrom 46 witnesses who saw me there, including the mayor, including the general, including so\nand so. And when I got back, what did I discover? I don\u2019t know what the yu \u2014 nobody would tell\nme what had happened. And here I hear for the first time that Jews were being killed. Can you\nimagine something like that? Jews were being killed by my outfit, when I wasn\u2019t there. I was\nappalled. You know, and they came with excuses.

Nine months, they came in with all this baloney.\nAnd the judge, Michael Musmanno, much to my unhappiness, I would say, said, whatever\nevidence they want to submit in their defense 1s admissible. He passed what he called the\npenguin rule. Up to and including the sex life of a penguin, it\u2019s admissible. And I was furious\nbecause the rules of evidence, you know, these guys were lying. Well, I wasn\u2019t going to take\nthat. So I called in our investigative division, as we were going along and I said, look, these are\nthe defendants, this is their home address, this is what we know about them.

Therefore, it was\nnecessary to kill them. But I always insisted that my men do it in a humane way. If I saw they\nwere enjoying the work, I took them off the job. And I instructed them, if a woman had an infant\nchild, let her keep the infant, because they could then fire into the child and kill the woman at the\nsame time, which saved ammunition. That was a much easier way of dealing with it. So you see,\nhe was really an idealist and a humanitarian. And I went down \u2014 in his way \u2014 and I went down to\nthe death house and I said, al \u2014 Herr Ohlendorf \u2014 I didn\u2019t call him by his general rank \u2014 I said, is\nthere anything you\u2019d like to tell me?

He did explain that he wasn\u2019t sure of the number, that occasionally the troops\nwould be bragging, and exaggerating the body count. So it might have been less, but it might\nhave been more. And he was the father of five children, well-educated, a doctorate. Most of my\ndefendants had degrees of one kind or another.

But since the judges were all distinguished jurists,\nthe British presiding judge, for example, they knew the rules of evidence, they knew what was a\nfair trial. And they had to merge different judicial systems; the French system, for example, is\nquite different from the American and the British. The Russian is also quite different. So, it was\nnecessary for them to come up with rules of fairness, which they did. They did very well.

        "A: It's not so much a matter of emphasizing one against the other. The first category that you\nmention, Crimes Against Peace, or otherwise known as Aggression, that has been perceived\nfor a long time as being, as the Tribunal said in this case in the IMT\u201d trial, the greatest of all\ncrimes because it encompasses all the other crimes. When you commmit a Crime Against\nPeace, an act of aggression, the war that follows invariably involves killing large numbers of\npeople and the rape and the devastation and the destruction and every crime that you can\nimagine take place in a war. So, commmitting a war of aggression is the most serious crime\nthat any head of state can commit. This was known after the First World War. And efforts\nwere made at that time to bring the Kaiser to trial for aggression against little Belgium, for\nexample. And this was hotly debated by international lawyers. The Kaiser himself had fled\nto the town of Doorn in Holland where he was known as \"the Woodchopper of Doorn\" -- the\nDutch refused to extradite him because there was no precedent for trying a head of state for\nthe crime of aggression. And the international lawyers who were dealing with it, including\nthe American and Japanese, who were then on our side, felt that -- well, all right, in order not\nto have retroactive justice, they will not try him for the crime of aggression, because it had\nnever been declared to be an international crime. They would charge him, in the Treaty of\nVersailles, of \"crimes against the dictates of human conscience,\" which had been referred to\n'* The International Military Tribunal.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So the Dutch still refused to turn him over and he never was put on trial.\nHowever, when we got to Nuremberg, Justice Jackson, who was a first-class jurist, said,\n\"Look, the time has come for the law to take a step forward.\" The principle of non-\nretroactive activity is a principle of equity, you don't charge a person of a crime when he\ndidn't know it was a crime at the time it was commmitted. However, did not Hitler know\nthat invading a state... a friendly neighboring state is a crime? Did not everybody in the\nworld know that? So to declare that a crime does not violate any equitable principle,\nparticularly in the light of all the precedents that we have. We had the Hague Agreements in\n1898, of 1907, we had the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928 saying that war is outlawed. These\npacts all had loopholes written into them, and then Jackson was certainly aware of that, but\nhe said, \"Look, the time has come and there's nothing unfair about trying these guys for the\ncrime against peace, of committing aggressive war, even though \u2018aggression\u2019 was not\ndefined.\" And Jackson dealt with that in his opening statement -- he said, Look: aggression\nhas not yet been defined in legal terms but whatever it was, this is it, I know an elephant\nwhen I see one. So he was deliberately takiing the law a step forward to do...to keep up with\nthe common sense of mankind. And it was based upon the long tradition which had already\nbeen established that the medieval notion of warfare, where the king goes out and kills,\ndoesn't apply in modern times. So that was the first and the most important principle out of\nthe Nuremberg Charter. Incidentally, all of these principles were then affirmed unanimously\nby the United Nations General Assembly, and they were also affirmed by the Tribunal which\nexamined the thing, and I will tell you in connection with the Crimes Against Humanity,\nthey interpreted it in a very restricted way. The second one was the Crimes Against\nHumanity. That connotation had never existed before and the theory behind it was: when\ncrimes reach a certain magnitude, they shock the conscience of humankind. They are crime\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

But it's a crime against all of\nhumanity, and therefore humanity as the injured party has the right to be the plaintiff and can\nbring the charges for that crime. That also was a step forward, but it was not an unfair step\nforward, it was a necessary step forward if you were going to have a civilized international\nsociety. And in medieval notions, which were perfectly okay perhaps when a king lived\nbehind a castle wall, didn't apply. So Crimes Against Humanity was another step forward.\nThe third category, War Crimes, that was a cinch: the Hague Agreements of 1899 had\ndefined what's permissible in warfare, what's not, any violation and devastation beyond the\nneeds of military necessity, rape, plunder, poison gas -- things of that kind -- these were well\nestablished crimes, they presented no problem. Now there was a restriction put on by the\nInternational Military Tribunal. The Tribunal itself, in reviewing its own jurisdiction, said,\nLook: we have the right as international lawyers of great repute -- they were key people from\nall the countries -- to examine the Charter and see whether the Charter is an exercise in\ncreating new law or whether it is a legal instrument which we are bound by. They said it's a\nlegal instrument we are bound by because it enunciates principles which would be binding,\nand which are, binding law. But, they said, because of the wording of the statute -- and it was\nan accident, really, for someone put a semicolon in, I won't go into the detail -- in order for\nthere to be a Crime Against Humanity, it must also be linked with one of the other crimes,\nCrimes Against Peace. And that meant that the killing of large numbers of people without a\nwar would not be a Crime Against Humanity, would not be within the jurisdiction of the\nCourt. And that's what they held. Some of us who'd been involved were shocked at that\ninterpretation. We said, \"That's wrong! We didn't have that in mind. You mean to tell me\nthat Hitler kills all his Jews and he's not at war with anybody else, that is not a punishable\noffense?\" That's what the Tribunal said: under this Charter we cannot act. So we changed\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

We changed that very specifically by a Control Counsel law -- the governing agency of\nall of Germany at that time was the Control Counsel consisting of the four Powers -- Soviet\nUnion, France, the U.S., and the --which did I leave out? -- the U.K. And this Control\nCounsel enacted Control Counsel Law No. 10 which corrected that and said very\nspecifically: Crimes Against Humanity are not linked to any other crimes, and that meant\nthat if you killed your own nationals and the crimes were of such magnitude that they\nshocked the conscience -- that was not more clearly defined -- then it becomes a Crime\nAgainst Humanity, which is a different international criminal offense. And that was then\nconfirmed in the Einsatzgruppen case while I was pushing on that one and in one other case\nin the subsequent trials. So that today, despite the confusion which exists among many\ninternational lawyers who write big books on the subject, the fact is that it is the legal right of\nnations to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity, and I think it is a legal duty on their\npart to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity. And that has tremendous consequence\nfor the development of peaceful and law-abiding international society. Quick lecture. Sorry.",
        "A: Yes. Let me again clarify what has been a frequent misunderstanding. I'm not talking now\nabout the Army Trials at Dachau. When the Trials were declared to be over by the Pentagon\nbecause they didn't want to budget, everybody went home and all was forgiven, and that was\nthe end of that. Those who were still in prison, I don't remember if they served; some of them\ndid serve the sentence and some of them were hanged after that. But I mean the trials\nthemselves ended.

There were about\n15 or 16 death sentences pending; over 13 came out of my Einsatzgruppen Trial. When John\nMcCloy came in as High Commissioner to replace General Clay, General Clay apologized to\nhim for not having gotten rid of this nasty business, because there was an appeal pending\nbefore the Supreme Court, they couldn't act until that was settled. The appeal was rejected\nby the Supreme Court of the United States and the lot fell to McCloy. McCloy had been the\nAssistant Secretary of War during World War II. He was a very distinguished establishment\nlawyer from New York, originally been from Philadelphia, and he knew nothing, really,\nabout the specifics of the trials or of those particular accused; he was familiar with the\noverall trials and in fact supported them in the Department of the Army when he was\nAssistant Secretary of War. So he had his legal department study all of these records. And\nhe did something else: he appointed a three-member panel, a Clemency Board, to review the\ncases and make recommendations as to what should be done. The principal officer was\nJudge Peck of New York, who I think is Jewish. There was one man from the State\nDepartment, and there was one who was a professional penalogist. their instructions were to\ngo over these files. Their specific instructions, which is not generally known but which I\ndug out later -- they were secret at the time -- said: \"You are not to review the correctness of\nthe decisions in any case. That has already been determined and 1s binding. The only thing\nyou are to reexamine are the personal circumstances of each defendant, such as his health,\nhis family condition, or differences in the severity of sentences for the same crime. So that if\none got off easy, one got 20 years, another got 10 years for the same crime, you would\nrecognize that as being inequitable and make a recommendation to bring that one into line.\"\nIt was not, I repeat not, a pardon committee, they had no jurisdiction whatsosever, on the\ncontrary, to challenge the validity of any of the decisions of the Tribunals of Nuremberg in\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The Peck Panels, as they came to be called, sat down and\nthen had to go over some of these files. I happened to be in Nuremberg at the time,\nrunning the restitution programs, beginning to set them up. I wrote to the Peck panel, I\nwrote to Peck and the others, and I said, \"Look, gentlemen, I know you're here with a very\ndifficult job\" -- I was executive counsel then for Telford Taylor for all the trials but there was\nanother additional job I took on, and I said, \"I'm thoroughly familiar with all of the trials and\nshould you require any information or any assistance in any way, I'm at your service.\" They\nwrote back in a letter which will go to the National Archives, which I just recently\nuncovered, saying \"Thank you very much but no thanks, we're only going to hear from the\nattorneys for the defendants. We don't want to hear from any attorneys for the prosecution.\"\nSurprised me at the time, and annoyed me at the time I must say. And so the Peck Panel\nmet, they had a few meetings together in Munich, a lovely city, they could travel all around\nsouthern Bavaria, to Austria from there, and they did, spent the summer that way, and then\nthey made their recommendations to Mr. McCloy. And he then, together with General\nHandy'\u201d who was dealing with the military -- some of the leftovers of the Dachau Trials --\nthey issued a Clemency Report which I will give to the Holocaust Museum, which I'm sure\nyou'll find in the archives, in which they confirmed three or four of the death sentences,\ncommuted the rest, usually to life imprisonment, lowered the sentences on some defendants.\nThe only defendant against whom there had been a judgment of forfeiture of all his assets\nwas the multi-billionaire Alfred Krupp. They gave him back all of his assets; and that was\nthat. That evoked a tremendous outcry of protest -- from the Nazi victims and from the\nJewish organizations and from General Telford Taylor. As a result, Mr. McCloy has not\nbeen in the good graces of either the Nazi victims or the Jewish organizations. Now, I feel --\n'\u00b0 General Thomas Handy, U.S. Army.

He was criticized, including in a book\nby William Manchester called, The Arms of Krupp, which attacked Mr. McCloy in a very\nharsh way, I think, for having released Mr. Krupp from prison and having given him back\nhis very sizable fortune. McCloy was condemned as having done this as an act of political\nexpediency in order to woo the Germans back into the Allied camp so they could be rearmed\nand help fight against the Russians, the Soviets. I am absolutely convinced that was not Mr.\nMcCloy's motive, and the reason I am convinced of that is simple. I'm a man who looks\nthrough the documents, and before I talked to McCloy about it I looked at the documents. I\nfound his instructions to the Clemency Board and I found with great difficulty the Clemency\nBoard's recommendations, which were secret. And in the instructions I have indicated the\ninstructions were \"You are not to challenge these verdicts, we are not reviewing the validity\nof these sentences or of these judgments. We are only taking into account humanitarian\nconsiderations which may be applicable.\" Then when the Clemency Board recommended\nreduction of sentences for various people, McCloy checked all those recommendations and\nin many cases McCloy was more harsh than the Clemency Board had been. I drew up a\ntable, which I gave to my friend Telford Taylor, who was then my law partner, had been for\nmany years, and I said, \"Look here, if this man is trying to do something as an act of political\nexpediency, all he has to do is to accept the Clemency Board's recommendations, they're\nindependent people, or he can accept the German arguments that death penalties have been\noutlawed in Germany under the constitution and are no longer applicable, or accept the pleas\nof the various German peace groups and the religious groups and the anti-Nazi groups who\nwere beseeching again, and Mrs. McCloy was, too: \"Please don't hang these people.\"\nInstead of that, he ordered four of them to be hanged, which he didn't have to do, and he\nincreased the sentences on several others.

And I am convinced that\nhis motivation was humanitarian, it was sincere. I know, from having seen him very\nfrequently during that period, that he was torn by emotion at having to go over this, he had\nnever caused anybody to be hanged before, and it was not an easy thing for him. And so the\nharsh criticism that he was merely wooing the Germans at the expense of the Jews is a\nmistake. I know also the help he gave us in connection with Jewish restitution and the\nstatements that he made to the Germans, and the pressure he put on the Germans to see that\nthey paid more than they wanted to pay.",
        "A: Well, it's easy to criticize him, it fits into a pre-set pattern, you know -- that the Americans\nare wooing the Germans in order to get them to fight the Russians. That's the Manchester\npattern and it should be examined in that light and many people share that view, but it's a\npolitical opinion not based on fact. And McCloy has also been criticized for not bombing\nthe rail lines at Auschwitz, and I discussed that with him at some length long after the event.\nI did not intrude on him in what I recognized to be a personal decision that he alone had to\nmake about the life and death of other people. I felt that was something which should not be\nthe result of political pressure. And when I discussed with him the bombing of the rail lines,\nI said, \"Look: you realize that the Jewish community is in an uproar because of your failure\nto do that. What was going through your mind?\" He said, \"It was very simple. First of all,\nthe British, who are antisemitic, didn't want to, because they didn't want to divert their\nbombers from winning the war, which they perceived to be the primary goal. And we had to\nuse British bombers for that kind of an operation because we divided our responsibilities into\nsuch-and-such-and-such.

And\nthere were also strategic reasons. First of all, you'd have to bomb them from a height where\nit was almost inevitable you were going to hit the inmates. And if you start bombing\nbarracks of inmates, what is going to be the response politically on \"The United States\nbombs Jewish inmates and the other inmates in Auschwitz\"? And he said there was another\nstrategic consideration: bombing rail lines is a waste of time because they can be repaired\nimmediately. You bomb a few miles of rail lines: so what? They come with a rail train, they\nput a few rails down, so you've delayed them for an hour or two. It isn't going to change\nanything. On the contrary, they'll start killing them faster. He said: \"So in my judgment,\" he\nsaid, \"and not only in my judgement, Ben Rosenman's.\" So we took things to the highest\nlevel.

And when I came to\nthe Schreibstube in Mauthausen, there was a inmate there who was a Schreiber, as they\ncalled them, and that was a favored position in fact in the camp if you would be in the\nhospital or the Schreibstube or the kitchen.

And those records were the records of all\nof the SS men, the identification cards who had entered that camp and who had left the\ncamp, and had their photograph on it. It had their identifying numbers and addresses, date of\nbirth, things of that kind. And he was supposed to destroy each one of those records before a\nnew one was issued or when the man left the camp. He didn't do that, which meant that\nevery time he saved one of those records, there were hundreds of them, he put his life in\njeopardy. And he was ready to do that, hoping and knowing that one day there would be a\nday of retribution. And he saved those records for that day. So to me, it was a reflection of\nhuman hope and confidence and faith and courage which was very moving and dramatic for\nme. Now, there was some other incident which happened here a few weeks ago. I never\nknew who that man was. I admired his courage and his faith. And I never knew who he was\nand when I wrote about that in my book Less Than Slaves, I said he's a man whom I didn't\nknow. And then a few weeks ago I received a letter from a professor at the University of\nParis, the American University of Paris, Professor Pike who had written a book and in that\nbook he had described, I think the book was called The Servants of Stalin or In the Service\nof Stalin. He had described how communists had gone to Spain and had fought on the side\nof liberating forces and when they were defeated by Franco they had fled into France. When\nthe Germans occupied France, the Germans seized them and sent them to the Mauthausen\nconcentration camp to be killed or worked to death. One of those persons was in the service\nof Stalin, according to the book, was the man who handed me those records. And Professor\nPike identified him, and identified him by name, and identified another man in the camp who\nsends regards, who is now in Perpignon, in France, who had been also collecting and hiding\nthe death books registering the exceptional deaths that took place in the camp, listing the\nnames of all of the persons who had been killed by unusual means.

        "A: Well, as the Nuremberg Trials wound down, the Einsatzgruppen Trial was over, I was\nengaged in two activities. One was turning our records over to the Germans in the hope and\nexpectation that they would continue War Crimes Trials. You'll remember that we only had a\nvery small sampling. For example, in the Einsatzgruppen case, we had 3,000 men who were\nengaged in killing Jews for two years every day, and we only tried 22 of them, because of\nthe number of seats we had in the court room. But what about the rest? We had records.\nWe knew who they were. We knew where they had been, and there was material not only in\nthat case, but all of the other 12 subsequent trials had many residual fall outs. So, we set up\nat Nuremberg what we called a Special Projects Division. My wife Gertrude was engaged in\nthat activity as well, and the object was to turn those files over to the Germans, and we\nnegotiated with the various German prosecuting agencies to see if they would take those files\nand act on them. In addition to that, we were trying to publish the records of the Nuremberg\nTrials, which subsequently came out as the \"Green Series\"\u2019\u00ae of the 12 subsequent trials. And\nI was engaged in that as an editor right at the very beginning, and I think my wife was also\nworking on that.

It was never published. So, I was doing this wrapping up thing, and looking\nforward to going back and resuming a normal life and starting a law practice in New York.\nThat was my intention. One day I had a visit from a man who was the General Counselor to\nthe American Joint Distribution Committee. This is the Jewish organization which was the\nmost active, and the leading one --the only one-- at the time in assisting the D.P.s in the\ncamps, providing assistance to Jews, throughout the world, not in the United States, at that\ntime it was all in Germany. And their headquarters were in Paris, and their director was a\nman by the name of Doctor Joseph Schwartz. And their counsel said, would I come to Paris.\nThey would like to talk to me. And I came to Paris, and they said, \"Look, we have a\nproblem, and we'd like you to help us with that problem.\" And that problem is this: that the\nJewish organization had succeeded in persuading the U.S. Government to enact a law\nproviding for the restitution of property which had been stolen, confiscated, or taken by\nduress by the Jews or from others, because the restitutional laws covered not only Jews. And\none provision of that law was that the heirless property, or the unclaimed property which had\nbeen taken from those who were no longer there to file a claim should also be restored. Now,\nnormally, if a person dies heirless in the state of New York or anyplace else, the property is\nescheat, they call it, or passes to the state. But there's a principal law which says that they\nmay not be the beneficiary of any unlawful act. If you murder your wife, you cannot inherit\nher property. If you murder the Jews, the state which is responsible can hardly be the proper\nrecipient of the heirless property. So, military government as a matter of military law, don't\nforget Germany surrendered unconditionally, and the only government there was the military\ngovernment originally Quadrapartei, the four powers, later split up but each in their zone.\nThe United States was responsible for the Military Government Law and the U.S.-occupied\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And the military government law number 59, said that a successor\norganization of the appointed to recover the heirless Jewish property. The Jewish Restitution\nSuccessor Organization. And the Jewish organization that succeeded into getting that into\nlaw didn't know where to begin. So, they inquired about and they said, \"Benny, we would\nlike you to be the guy who sets this up. You know your way around Germany. You know\nwhat happened to the Jews.\" I was then a high ranking muckey-muck with the U.S. Army,\nand this was all military occupation at the time. \"We don't think anything will come of it,\"\nhe said, \"but we have a moral obligation to try. And of course we don't have any money to\nput into this, we need our money for relief of the survivors. We have enough to pay your\nsalary for six months\" which was I think six or seven thousand dollars all together, and\nwould you undertake this for us. \"Well,\" I said, \"I'll have to talk to my wife.\" We were\ngetting ready to go home, and we had been in Germany for about two years, and much\nlonger than we had expected. So I came back to Nuremberg, and I discussed it with my\ngood wife Gertrude and she said, \"Look it's true you know this business better than anybody\nelse. How long did they say it would take?\" I said. \"They said it might take two years.\"\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know you. It will only take one year. So, all right, so we'll stretch it a little\nbit longer.\" So, I agreed to stay, and I designated myself the Director General of the Jewish\nRestitution Successor Organization knowing that nothing would impress the Germans more\nthan being a director and a general and so that's how it began.\nTape #2",
        "A: I was hired for that job in August 1948 and we had an immediate major crisis. The law\nrequired that all claims be submitted by the end of that year, the end of December '48. That\nwas we had about three months, four months, in which to find staff, find funding, train staff,\nlocate the property, submit the claims on long forms, because this was the first step in a long\njudicial process. Well, the first thing I did was to recognize that that was impossible. So, as\nsoon as I agreed to undertake the job, I resigned from Nuremberg, and I went to see the\nCommanding General who was General Lucius Clay, who was the Commanding General for\nall U.S. Forces in Germany and stationed in Berlin. I had known General Clay from before\nbecause I had been head of the branch in Berlin that had been collecting the evidence for the\ntrials, and I went up to see him and I said \"I've got this problem and I need an extension of\nthe law.\" I said, \"I can't locate all the confiscated Jewish properties, hundreds of thousands\nof properties of all kinds all over Germany in three months time with no staff, no money, no\nnothing, and we discussed the problem and he said, \"No, I don't want to extend the law,\nbecause the sooner we get this problem over with the better off we're going to be. This will\nbe a thorn in Germany's side and I don't want to extend the restitution law.\" I said, \"All\nright, I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll make a deal with you. I will try to get it done, and I will\nonly come back to you if it's impossible, but I will try. But in order to get it done, I need\nmoney. First of all, I need staff.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"Didn't the organization know that when\nthey wanted to get this written into the law that it would cost money to do that?\" I said,\n\"You can't ask the Jewish organization which are now spending every penny they can raise\nto save the lives of these D.P.s to move them out of here and to rescue them to put money\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I said, \"I think we can take the money out of\noccupation funds.\" The United States Army was running on occupation funds, which meant\nthe German treasury printed the money, and we used the money to pay for whatever we\nneeded. He said, \"You know I can't get occupation funds because that requires Quadripartite\napproval. The Russians are going to have to agree. They'll never agree to using their money\nfor private property claims. I don't think the French will agree and I don't think the British\nwill even agree. And I can't do it on my own.\" So I said, \"Well, I have another proposition.\nLet me borrow the money from the American segment of the occupation funds, and when I\nget restitution I'll repay the money.\" He said, \"Can I do that legally?\" I said, \"I have a\nmemorandum here which says you can.\" He said, \"Well, okay, if you say it's legal and I can\ndo it, go down and talk to my finance man and tell him that's it okay and that whatever\nmoney you need to get going, but get going because I want to get this program over with.\"\nSo, I went down and I talked to a guy in charge of finance and I said, \"I just came from the\nGeneral and we're setting up a big restitution program here and we got a big rush job and I\nneed enough funds to get this thing going,\" and he said \"How much do you need?\" And I\nsaid, \" A million marks.\" \"Okay, sign here.\" A million marks was a hell of a lot of money\nand I signed here. I was always ready to sign. I signed promising to repay. With that\nmoney I immediately went out and hired a tremendous staff of German investigators. I had\nrequisitioned cars from the Army using my old Army authorizations as a war crimes\ninvestigator. I immediately seized every Jeep, every car I could grab from any motor pool\nand sent investigators into every real estate registry in Germany with instructions to copy\ndown the names of any Jewish names that transferred property since 1933. Very often the\nGermans had been very helpful to us, and they had stamped a J on the property, meaning\n\"Jude\", so you could identify. But it was a Jewish name, including Alfred Rosenberg, and\nit's true, we claimed the property of the big Nazi leader, Alfred Rosenberg, and the\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So then I set up, in Nuremberg, there were a club that were occupied by\nLatvians, they were mostly drivers. I knew the Latvians. Many of them and the Estonians\nand were very busy killing Jews before they retreated with the Germans and were captured\nby the Americans and then used by the Americans. So, I said, \"We'll throw them out of that\nbuilding. I need it for restitution.\" And bango, I move them out. I move my furniture from\nthe courthouse in Nuremberg as a prosecutor across the street to this Latvian club. And we\nset up there a big hall, a dance hall is what is really was, with tables right touching each\nother. Typewriter on every table, requisitioned or bought or seized from somewhere and 24\nhours a day we filed claims. As they came in from the field, as the investigators came in,\nthey brought the claims in. We had secretaries sitting there typing. I took an eight hours\nshift. Saul Kagan who was my Deputy and the first guy I hired took an eight hour shift.\nAnother man by the name of George Weiss, Dr. George Weiss who came from the JDC in\nParis and later headed the Austrian operations, he handled the third shift, and about the day\nof the filing deadline, we loaded all the claims into U.S. Army ambulance, which I had\nrequisitioned somewhere, and there was a claims center where we had to file these claims.\nAnd we took this ambulance and drove it up the claims center and filed, I think it was\n173,000 claims for 173,000 pieces of property in the American Zone of Germany. And I\ncalled up Lucius Clay and said, \"We don't need an extension. We filed everything.\" So,\nthat's how we submitted the claims, but of course that was only the beginning of the process.\nThe system which was set up was that a person who felt that he had been forced to sell his\nproperty under duress or had it confiscated, was authorized to file a claim setting down all\nthe facts. That then went to a restitution agency special judicial type agency, they weren't\nreally courts, to deal only with these claims. And they would hear the counter claims.\nBecause the person who bought it would say, \"Hey, wait a minute, I paid fair value for it\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The property wasn't even worth more than 80,000 and as a result\nof that he escaped. He sent me three letters when he was in Brooklyn. I don't where he is\nnow but he pulled out the letters and so on. And he didn't file the claim because he felt fairly\ntreated. Who are you to come here and claim the property?\" Or, they claimed, they said,\n\"Look, I bought the property. It was bombed out. It's only a room. I put on a new roof. The\nroof cost me more than the property was worth. Or there was a mortgage on the property. I\npaid off the mortgage. Who's going to give me back the mortgage money?\" And then the\nprocess began. Or there were two or three claimants, some of the heirs claimed them. They\nclaimed, some other person said they bought it in between it had passed through several\nhands. It was a complicated legal process which began. If any party was not satisfied with\nthe decision of the restitution agency, they could go to the restitution court. That was part of\nthe regular judicial system. From there they could file an appeal to the appellate branch of\nthe judicial system in Germany, German courts. And then there was a final court of\nrestitution appeals which was composed originally of Allied judges. Later, it was mixed\nAmerican judges, who sat on the Court of Restitution Appeals, and they would hear the legal\narguments and the factual arguments 1n all of these cases before rendering a final binding\ndecision. Their decisions are all published and I have them, and I have given them to the\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. So, this long legal process began, and for that, we needed\nlawyers. When we got the property back, we needed people who would manage it. We\nneeded people to repair it. We had businesses, hundreds of businesses of all kinds which had\nto be managed and run. And for all of this we had to train people. It never had happened\nbefore in history, and we couldn't trust the Germans. We had to be very careful. I had\naccess to all the Nazi Party files. We hired nobody without a security check which meant\nyou had a very limited selection because we had about nine million Nazi party files in Berlin\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So, it began and it was a very interesting legal process from one\npoint of view to try to create precedents if I give you a few legal questions which came up\nvery early on. Let me just make two or three to show you how history might have been quite\ndifferent with a few wrong decisions. The first key issue we had was at what rate of\nexchange do you have to repay. The principle of the law is simple. Ifa person enters into a\ncontract under duress, when that duress is removed, he has the option of undoing the\ncontract, but he has to give back what he got, and he gets back what he gave. These are the\nprinciples of law that I learned at Harvard. They are principles of equity and they're not\nsomething invented by military government. They should be applicable, and they are\napplicable in one way or another in all civilized societies. But what happened was, when the\nproperty was transferred in 1937 or '38, let's assume the Jewish owner received 100,000\nReichsmark coins, by 1949 or '50 the Reichsmark no longer existed. It was a Deutschmark.\nAnd the Deutschmark was converted at a ratio of ten to one. So he received a 100,000RM\nand he was giving back 10,000DM and the Germans said, Wait a minute. I gave you\n100,000 marks. You're now giving me back 10,000 marks.\" If the Jewish owner had been\nrequired to give back 100,000 marks he would have said the property is not worth it. I'm not\ngoing to put money into Germany's beat up old building there which has been bombed most\nlikely, pay back 100,000DM which was then, an awful lot of money. They didn't have the\nmoney for one thing. It would be completely different. I had a lot of problems with this. I\ntook this case to the Court of Restitution Appeals for the first advisor opinion before we\nbegan the program. And the issue was who bears the burden of the loss? Is it the victim, the\nJewish victim, it didn't have to be Jews, the victim of Nazi persecution, or is it the Nazi or\nthe German, it didn't have to be a Nazi, who acquired the property. To my mind the risk of\nthe currency devaluation should not rest with the victim who sold under duress. It should\nrest with the person who acquired the property just as if he kept his money in the bank, he\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

If the opinion had gone the other\nway, there would have been no restitution program in Germany, practically none. I'll give\nyou another case. A very dramatic case. The German Jews had mostly fled. They were\norganized in what's called Gemeinden; congregations. In Germany every town had their\nown Gemeinde, or congregation. These are legal entities in Germany. They asked anybody\nwho was a member of a congregation had to pay taxes to the state, and the state then\nsupports the congregation out of these funds. The German Jewish congregations had all\nbeen dissolved. Their property had been seized. Property consisted of old age homes,\nschools, cemeteries, buildings of various kinds, lodge buildings and the previous owners\nwere scattered all over the world. They were in Israel, they were in the United States, they\nwere in Chile, they were in Argentina, they were in Shanghai, wherever they could find\nrefuge. But some small groups had reconstituted themselves. They came into Munich.\nVery few of them had been members of that congregation before. They came from Poland.\nThey came from Russia. They came from other places, wherever they were. And they\nreestablished themselves, and said we are now the congregation. Some of them, having been\nforced to survive using all kinds of means were less than the most honorable or credible\npeople. To put it bluntly, some of them were a bunch of crooks as confirmed by their being\narrested from time to time on various charges. And they said, we are the owners. For\nexample, in Munich, they said, look we have set up a new congregation. We are claiming\nrestitution of the property. And I said \"Hold on. You're not claiming restitution of property\nbecause I am the successor organization. The JRSO, Jewish Restitution Successor\nOrganization as designated by Military Government law.\" They said, \"No, this is our\ncongregation.\" The synagogues, old age homes, the cemeteries, whatever it was, and some\nof them were very valuable properties. To make a long story short, I argued that case in the\nCourt of Restitution Appeals, and I remember it quite dramatically, because I addressed the\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I never thought I would stand here\nand argue against the Jewish community, but I have to, because those who are entitled\ncannot speak for themselves. And I made the argument that those who are entitled are\nscattered everywhere and we couldn't give the assets to a small self-proclaimed group who\nwere not subject to any kinds of controls, which we were of course as a charitable\norganization of the Military Government in the first place, under control of all the world's\nJewish organization in the second place. And I won the case. It was known as the\n\"Augsburg Case\" because it was against the Augsburg community. Some of those who\nargued against me ended up in jail. But there again, if that case had gone the other way all\nthe Jewish properties in Germany which had belonged to congregations, would have been\ndissipated and would have disappeared. So, we had several cases like that which were\ndecisive on how this program was to be carried out and we had good luck, I think; well,\nmore than good luck. I think we were on the nght side, and being able to carry out that\nprogram for the recovery of thousands of pieces of heirless and unclaimed Jewish property.\nI don't want to run on too long, but if you would like me to give you some of the difficulties\nwe encountered with that program, I think it may be of Jewish historical interest because in\nthe end, we had to surrender. And we did it in an interesting way. What happened because\nof some of these problems of currency conversion and because of the Germans resented,\nunderstandably resented having to give up their homes which they had lived in. Or their\nbusinesses which they had acquired and changed over the years in many ways that they had\ninvested all kinds of things. And there was no substitutes. I mean, housing was in great\ndemand. So, there was fierce resentment against this strange organization which comes\nalong and insists upon taking the property back and paying only a small fraction of what has\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I\nsaid I'm sorry, you collect that from the German government. You don't collect it from me,\nbecause you never go it. So, it got to be a very, very bitter business, and it was generating\nanti-semitism in Germany which didn't need to have any anti-semitism generated in the\nimmediate postwar or [post-] Hitler years. And I could see that 1t would take a long time.\nMeanwhile the Jews were being moved out of Germany from the D.P. camps to Israel,\nwhich itself was destitute, and it was at war, and there was no place to put them. They were\nin U.S. Army paramital tents which a tent the size of a room, which would have 15 Army\ncots in it.

There was a case that I recall where a\nwoman had acquired the home of a Jewish neighbor. I don't remember if it was 1937, '38\nsomewhere around there, maybe even earlier than that, and no claim had been filed except\nby the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization. We asserted the claim. She made the\nusual arguments. I was helping my Jewish neighbor, what do you want. Who are you? We\nsaid never mind, move. We're going to give you back one-tenth of what you paid. It so\nhappened that she was the aunt of an American Army General, who not only was an\nAmerican Army General, he happened to be the Commanding General of the District in\nGermany that was Baden-Wiurttemberg in which she lived. And he called me up and he\nsaid, \"What the hell do you think you're doing? My aunt was no Nazi. She helped her\nJewish neighbor and they didn't file a claim because the were grateful to her, and how do you\ncome off here filing a claim and demanding that she get out of her house and your big deal\nyou're offering her one-tenth of what she paid for it.\" And I said, \"Sir, I'm here to carry out\nthe law. That's what's provided in the law, and I think the law is correct. I negotiate with\nyour aunt. I negotiate with others. We try to reach a settlement. We try to be fair in our\nsettlements and not adhere to the last drop of blood or the pound of flesh. We make the same\noffer to your aunt. If she refuses, I will simply carry out the law which is a Military\nGovernment law, which you may recall, and I'm director general of that organization\nappointed by Military Government to carry out that law, and that's what I intend to do. So\nplease advise your aunt accordingly.\" He said, \"Like hell I will. I'll show you.\" And he\ncalled Mr. McCloy, John McCloy who was the High Commissioner for Germany. Mr.\nMcCloy got on the phone with me and said \"You know, I just got a call from General So-\nand-So. I've forgotten his name actually, and he's raising holy hell. He says you're\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

You're trying to throw her\nout of her house, and all she did was help her Jewish friend. And he's very distressed.\" And\nI said, \"Mr. McCloy, as a good lawyer, you know very well, that a transaction in 1938 was a\nduress transaction and it's voidable at the option of the person whose property was taken. I\nam in the shoes of that person, and I exercise that option as I must to require that the\ntransaction be rescinded, which is what I've done and that is consistent with the law and\nconsistent with my notions of equity and justice, and I'm sure it is with yours.\" And he said,\n\"Yes, I guess it is. I'll call up the General and tell him.\" Well, that's what happened.\nEventually, I think we settled with the aunt. But we had this problem thousands of times,\nagain and again recurring. And it not only took time, but we were not getting the money we\nneeded for these urgent tasks that I've described of saving lives and so I decided to take\nanother approach. And that was to try to sell these claims to the German government, to\neach state government, global settlements. And I went to the Landerpresidenten, the Finance\nMinistries in the different German states in Bavaria, Baden-Wirttemberg, Berlin, and Hesse,\nand I said, \"Look, we've got this problem. We are generating a lot of anti-semitism. You\ndon't want anti-semitism.\" By that time the people who were in office were anti-Nazis,\notherwise they couldn't have gotten into office, and we've got to solve this problem. \"And\nthe way I suggest I we solve it, I'll assign the claims to you so that you're not the beneficiary\nby way of this cheat but then you can settle them on whatever terms you feel are right. If\nyou want to give them back the property, that's your business, but you can't ask the Jews to\nmake that sacrifice in order to maintain peace in your Land.\" And the first such settlement\nwe made was with the Land Hesse, Frankfurt is nearby, it was in Wiesbaden, a big palace in\nWiesbaden. There are some funny stories connected with that but I won't have time to tell\nyou, but that was the first settlement, for 25 million marks, that's a lot of money. Long\nbefore the Hague negotiations, I think it was 1950, 1951, it must have been, in which the\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And then we did this with the other Lander. We went on to Berlin. We had a\nvery difficult problem in Baden-Wurttemberg. The man in charge of Baden-Wurttemberg 1s\na man whose name you'll find in your Holocaust Archives, Otto Kuster. Otto Kuster was a\nvery moral and righteous human being, a very strong sense of justice who was very helpful\nin connection with arguing the I.G. Farben appeal on behalf of slave laborers. And I knew\nhim quite well and I had great respect for him. And he said \"I will not accept the assignment\nof your claims.\" I said \"Why not?\" He said, \"Because you will carry out the law as it is\nintended to be. I cannot. I am an official.\" He was then in charge of restitution of the state\nof Baden-Wiurttemberg. I will not be able to carry out that for political reasons. And it's\nimportant that justice be done and therefore I will not accept your claims. You do it.\" I said,\n\"Have pity. I can't do it. Look at the problems I'm having, the expense, the time, the\naggravation, the anti-semitism that we're causing.\" \"No,\" he said, \"You do it.\" I never\nsettled Baden-Wirttemberg. We settled every where else, but we fought those cases\nthrough, and that where this General's aunt was as well. So, this is an illustration of not only\na specific problem but a difficult political problem which encountered and an economic\nproblem as well. And we solved it legally by assigning our claims globally. Making global\nsettlements with all the Lander. And then the states went on for many years some of them\ncomplained that they paid too much. Some of them recognized that they had made a gain,\nbecause as the years went by the prices went up and so on. But by and large, it was a fair\nand sensible arrangement as I look at it now in retrospect. And it was a way to get out. We\nhad begun on a legal path which seemed right at the time, but found it to be insurmountable\nas it went along. So we had many such problems. If you have time let me tell you some\nmore. Let me tell you another problem, which was a very fascinating problem in a way, too.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nThe problem is what do you do about Jewish cemeteries. I know nothing about the\nOrthodox Jewish rituals, but I had enough common sense to realize that I wasn't going to\ntouch that subject without strict control and guidance by those who knew more than I and\nwere responsible. Under the restitution law the Jewish communities were gone. They all\nhad their own cemeteries. Every congregation had a local cemetery. Sometimes it was\nsignificant plot of land, sometimes there were Jews buried in one portion and had not been\nused for the other portions. So, I set up a Rabbinical council, headed by Rabbi Herzog, the\nchief Rabbi of Israel at that time, Rabbi Leo Baeck, who was the chief German Rabbi when\nthey were driven out, and there was another German Rabbi who represented the Jewish\ncommunities in Germany. And these three were to give me the guidelines of what could be\ndone with the Jewish cemetery once it's been restituted. My instructions to the staff were we\nabide strictly by these rules, and the rules were: once a Jewish cemetery, always a Jewish\ncemetery. You cannot do anything with the land in which somebody is buried. Even if a\ntombstone falls down, you must not pick it up. You must leave it lying there, which was a\nsurprise to me, of course, because all Jewish cemeteries had been desecrated. But if there is\nan area where there are no bodies, then it may fenced off and it can be sold provided it's not\nsold for a profane purpose. What is a profane purpose? You have to go back and look in the\nTalmud. A hospital obviously is not a profane purpose. A dance hall probably is. A\ngambling casino certainly 1s, so we had to know what was being sold and for what purpose it\nwas being sold. Let me just take a minute or two for a very amusing story, or it seems to me.\nWe had a situation of a cemetery in the old town of Fulda. Fulda is in the north of Hesse, 1s\nfamous for the Fulda Gap, where all the armies invade. It's an old Catholic town. Lots of\nchurches, and there was a Jewish cemetery in Fulda, and it was a large area and the social\ndemocratic mayor wanted to use part of the cemetery, which was in the center of town, by\nthe time the years had passed. Originally it was outside the town, but it may have been a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

He said he wanted to use it as a custom house. To build a custom house, itt was right\non the East German border. I inquired with Rabbinical Council, which I did very strictly on\nall such matters and they said custom house, yes, that's okay. I happened to be in New York\nwhen I was reporting to the Board of Directors, a very dramatic telegram. They're building\nthe custom house and they're digging up bones. Well, the contract was very clear, there was\na certain area [in] which Jewish graves were known to exist. That area was to be fenced off.\nThey were going to have a little memorial park next to it. The cemetery itself had been\ndesecrated completely, but we were going to have a little park there with a plaque and the\ncustom house to be built in the area on the blueprint where there were no graves. Well, that\ncreated a major problem. And I rushed back, -- I sent a telegram, seek an immediate\ninjunction. Stop all building, I'm on my way home. And when I got back to -- I think we\nwere in Frankfurt at the time -- I said, how far has it come? Well, they already had about\nfour stories on the building, big building. And one portion of it was seemed to me over the\ngraveside. It was just a small area of maybe 10 by 15 feet and I said \"Tear the building\ndown.\" They said, \"You can't do that. The Jewish community can't do that. We have to live\nin this town. You can't ask me to tear that building down.\" What the hell were they\nthinking, it's a breach of contract. Tear the building down. It's their problem. And they said\nwe can't do that, their life will be unbearable. I said well, let me consult with the Rabbinical\nCouncil. And I consulted with the Council, and they went into a meeting and conference and\nthey finally came up with a solution. And they said, \"The Torah says that you may not have\nanything on the cemetery except a Jewish Prayer house. So, what you have to do is raise the\nbuilding and it's not the cemetery.\" I said, \"Raise a five story building. They may know\nmore about the Torah, but they don't much about engineering. You can't raise a five story\nbuilding.\" So, we went back to the rabbis and said you better look some more. And then\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

If you can't raise the\nbuilding, you have to build the prayer house under the building so that the building rests on\ntop of the prayer house, and there is nothing that says you can't build a building on top of a\nprayer house. Only you can't build it on the cemetery. That's an idea. So what we did, and\nto anybody that ever views this tape, I recommend they go and check it out. In the corner of\nthe customs house in the city of Fulda, there is a small room which is a prayer house built in\naccordance with specifications laid down in Israel, with inscriptions on the wall in Hebrew\nwith stained glass windows and candelabra. There is room for a Torah, there's an ark, but\nthere is no Torah there, and that was built in the basement, excavated under the customs\nhouse and it is the world's most unknown and unused, smallest synagogue that ever existed.\nAnd I went to check up on that ten years later, and I came to the customs house and I said to\nthe concierge, I want to visit the synagogue. They said, \"Well, you go outside and go down\nand turn down to the left, three blocks and then you turn to the right three blocks and there's\nthe Jewish synagogue.\" I said, \"No, no. I want to see the synagogue in this building.\" And\nhe said, \"This building is the custom house.\" I said, \"There better be a synagogue in this\nbuilding. Call somebody.\" So he called somebody upstairs and they came running down\nand said Oh, yes, yes, yes. They had a bunch of keys and took me down into the basement\nand kicked some boxes away from the front of the door and opened the door and said, \"Is\nthis what you're looking for?\" And I said, Yes, that's it. I went in and I inspected it. It was\nstill there and I said, \"Does anybody ever use this?\" He said \"No, never.\" I said, \"Has\nanybody ever been in here?\" He said, \"No, never.\" I said \"Do you keep it clean?\" He said,\n\"We always keep it clean.\" I said, \"Fine, thank you very much. Keep on doing it.\" So, go\nand visit the Customs House in Fulda and check up for me. They are bound to do that\nforever. Let me tell you another story about forever. This is a very serious matter.

Now,\nunder German law, a cemetery is maintained for only twenty years. The system there 1s\nevery town has their own cemetery, and everybody who is a resident of that town is entitled\nto be buried in that cemetery. And they go one after the other. As you die, you're put in the\nrow in a small place, very orderly. The Germans are very orderly people. And after twenty\nyears, you're required to take away the tombstone or they'll take it away for you, and they put\nsomebody else in the same spot. Saves ground, saves money, and I guess it saves emotional\nsentiment, they say after twenty they say stop grieving. Well, they were quite prepared to do\nthat, but as we were reaching the end of the twenty year period, they said \"Now you take\ncare of the cemeteries.\" I said \"Wait a minute. Jewish law requires the cemetery to be\nmaintained forever.\" The said, \"Forever? It costs money. You have to cut the grass, have a\nfence around it. It costs money. We're not going to pay that. If you have a peculiar ritual,\nwe're not bound by that. Why should we treat you better than we treat our own?\" Well, it\ngot to be a very emotional argument. A very dramatic argument. I had just come back from\nAuschwitz. Anyway, the Germans were finally persuaded to accept the Jewish ritual, and\nthey do maintain the cemeteries in Germany in perpetuity. This was also part of the\nrestitution program, things the public doesn't know anything about.",

        "A: Since the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, JRSO, or as the Germans called it,\nJRSO\"\u2019, was authorized to claim all unclaimed or heirless Jewish property. It also recovered\nthousands, many thousands of Jewish cultural objects, which had been assembled by the\nGermans. For example, the Germans collected Torah scrolls. A warehouse full of Torah\nscrolls. Tons of Jewish ceremonial objects taken from all the occupied territories. It was in\nEinsatzstab Rosenberg Special Unit, Alfred Rosenberg was the Nazi ideologue and it was\nnamed in his honor which had that as their assignment to go and seize all Jewish cultural\nobjects and hold them. The Nazis had various plans for them. These were eventually\nassembled in a big warehouse in Wiesbaden in the custody of the United States Army, and\nthey in turn turned it over to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of which I was\nthe director. Now, thereto, out first goal was to try to locate the owners if there was a\nKiddush plate or something that had the name \"This 1s the family of so-and-so of Warsaw\"\nwe tried to find out where the man was. If it came from the congregation that still existed we\ntried to send it there. We did the same incidentally with individual properties of restitution.\nIf the owner showed up later and said, I didn't file a claim on time or it was too short, but I'm\nreally the owner, I'm really the heir, we worked out what we called an equity procedure of\ngiving the property back to the real owners, subject to a very modest 10 percent I think it was\nservice charge for the expense in getting it back. So, here our first goal was to restore it to\nthe rightful owners. But usually you couldn't tell. So, the next goal was try to distribute\nthem wherever they were needed for Jewish reconstruction, the reconstruction of Jewish life.\nThe rllowine Fronouned the ase a recorded interview.

Information about access and\nusage rights can be found in the catalog record.\nAnd a separate entity was set up by the Jewish organizations to do that called Jewish\ncultural reconstruction. And Professor Salo Baron of Columbia University was a member of\nour board of directors was in charge of that and Hannah Arendt was one of the persons who\nfirst came to Germany to help guide us with what to do with these things. Because I really --\nI was a young fellow, I didn't really know anything about Jewish cultural life in Germany\nand particularly the religious life. So, we set up this Jewish cultural reconstruction, and we\nhad staff. We were still in Nuremberg. This was the very early days, to come in to help us\nwith that. Hannah Arendt was one and then we brought in experts from Israel. There was a\ngentleman by the name Narcus, another Shanomi who came from the Museum\nin Israel to help us with the Kiddush cups and with the pointers and the Torah crowns and all\nof the objects. We also had people restoring them. We had, for example, a school of scribes\nworking in Paris, to restore Torah scrolls, and I learned that a scroll can be repaired except if\nthe word \"Shaddai,\" or God, is injured in which case you cannot -- if that's been damaged\nyou cannot restore that. The Torah scroll has to buried in Israel, following a certain religious\nritual. All of which we followed very precisely. I was very insistent on that. I said \"Look\nwe take the law as laid down by the Rabbinical Council, and we don't vary that in any way\nand that is absolutely strictly to be observed.\" And it was. The School of Scribes sat in Paris\nunder the control of the JDC and they repaired those Torahs that could be saved, and the\nRabbinical Council would advise where they were needed. New congregations in Israel, big\nrecipients. Congregations in other parts of the world where they needed some sent as\nremembrance scrolls to different communities throughout the world. And we did the same\nwith the ceremonial objects. Where we could find the owner, we restored them. Where we\ncouldn't, we returned them. Where it was damaged, we restored them, we then distributed\nwherever it was needed, and at the end we still had tons of broken silver. Knives, forks,\ndishes, plates.

And I, being very careful, found a Jewish silversmith, Goldsmith Brothers in London,\nand I said, all right we'll send it to them. They cannot be repaired. We cannot trace the\nowners. They are just scraps. Nothing can be done with it. We'll smelt it down and we'll\nuse the proceeds then for Jewish charity. I thought that was being very clever. And I went\nto the board of directors in New York, where we had our annual meetings and I reported on\nthe great care that we exercised in disposing of all these things and I was feeling very cocky\nand very proud of myself and I said and now we have received $50,000 for these silver\nscraps which we sent off to the silversmith Goldsmith Brothers in London, and they smelted\nthem and they sent us the proceeds and this is now available for distribution by the charitable\norganizations. Whereupon the first person to raise his hand a member of the board of\ndirectors. A very distinguished elderly gentleman. He is now and was less elderly then, he\nis still living, Isaac Lewin who was the Chairman of Augudat Israel world organization, and\nhe said \"Mr. Ferencz, do my ears believe me? You took these holy objects and you sent\nthem to a crematorium?\" Boy, I knew from that question that I was cooked, and I tried to\nexplain the best I could that it was not really a crematorium it was just our way of trying to\ncarry out our assignment and realized that assets to the benefit of those who survived. I don't\nthink he really ever forgave me for that. But we did become good friends in later years. But\nit's an illustration of some of the problems you know of dealing with this new area which had\nnever been done before. We had paintings which we disposed of, and we had all kinds of\nthings. It was another facet of the restitution program.",

Where there had been collections of it. Let me tell you another\nstory of collections. Among the collections were, of course, many Jewish books, prayer\nbooks of various kinds, some incunabla.'* I'm not sure exactly what that is but old Jewish\nbooks of great value. The Germans had also collected such books, I mean the German\nUniversities, German churches, part of their religious studies, and the Nazis had picked that\nup too. So, the previous owners had been institutions that had legitimately acquired those\nbooks. And they were quite valuable. One day a Jewish rabbi, a chaplain I think his name\nwas Bernstein, pulled up with an ambulance to the back of one of these archives and selected\nsome of the most valuable Jewish books, and filled up the ambulance and put them on a ship\nsmuggling immigrants to Israel, Palestine, as it was then known. And so, these were books\nwhich had belonged to legitimate German institutions and had been lawfully acquired. So, it\nwas a case of unlawful confiscation. And one day I got a call from General Clay, and he said\n\"Benny, you better come up here. We got a problem.\" And he said, \"I have this captain. I'm\nabout to court martial him for stealing Jewish German property. And he said we have a\nrestitution program here restoring property to those from whom it was unlawfully taken.\nThat doesn't mean you can go out and steal property from the Germans, and I think I'm going\nto have to court martial him.\" I said, \"Look, don't do that for God's sake. Is that really\nnecessary? Mitigating circumstances, he thought it was Jewish property?\" He didn't know, I\ndidn't know. I said, \"I'll get it back.\" He said, \"All right, you go and get it back for me.\" I\nsaid \"Okay, I'm going to go to Israel. I have to deliver a shipload of prefabricated houses\nbought from Austria with restitution money. I'll get it back. Give me a list.\" So he gave me\na long list, I don't know ten, twelve pages of different books of which I didn't know nothing,\n'S Incunabla generally refers to any broadsheet printed before 1500 with Gutenberg movable type.\nThe follow ys Instance: it ike eters to Torah scroms and holy book primary source document, not this transcript.

Where is it?\" He said, \"It's in Mount Scopus.\" I said, \"Let's go\nup to Mount Scopus and get it. I got to bring it back. I promised him I'd bring it back and\nthey're going to let this captain off the hook.\" Meanwhile they sent him home. They sent\nhim right home, Philip Bernstein it was. I said well, Mount Scopus, and they said you can't\ngo up there. The Arabs are up there, it's between us and the Arabs. It was the old city. So,\nyou can't go up there. It's Hebrew, Mount Scopus, you can't get there. I said, \"When can I\nget there?\" He said, \"When the war's over.\" Good, I'll tell that to Clay. So, I go back to\nBerlin, and I report to General Clay and I tell him, \"Sorry, General, they're ready to make\nrestitution, but the Arabs are there. If you send me some tanks, I'll go get it, but otherwise\nyou'll have to wait until things quiet down and then we'll get restitution. And he accepted\nthat. And then, of course, he left shortly thereafter, and Mr. McCloy came in, and to my\nknowledge, that has never been settled by way of restitution, although we did have such a\nproblem in the Hague negotiations with the Germans, and I think the Templars, a German\nsociety, whose land was taken in Israel, they made some kind of a deal which may have\nincorporated some of these books. I really don't know. But it was a case of the Jewish\norganization being required to make restitution. Whether they did or not, I really cannot\nswear.",

After\nbeing there for ten years, we had four children, and I just didn't want them to be raised in\nGermany, and neither did my wife, so we decided to resign from these organizations and\nreturn to New York.

        "A: It was a colonial, cloistered existence. Perhaps you could ask my wife to explain what it was\nfrom her point of view. We didn't fraternize. The first German I let into my house after\nliving in Germany for seven years, as a guest, anyway, was Professor Franz Bohm, who had\nwalked out of the German delegation in protest against the action of his government. But I\nmay tell you about that when we talk about Hague negotiations. But it was a very colonial\ntype existence. The Americans fraternized only with the Americans. Germans were used as\nservants. There was a time when cigarettes were the currency. Everything was very cheap.\nIt was a comfortable life like the British living in India would be comparable.

        "A: Nobody could live in Germany without seeing black market activity. Germany was run on\nthe black market. Everything was black market. There was nothing else outside the black\nmarket. There were rations, sure. I mean you could choose between bread or beer. There\nwas an official black market in Berlin, for example, just set up by Mrs. Clay, where 1n order\nto attempt to curb the wild black market they could bring their stuff to this central black\nmarket -- 1t wasn't called that, it was trading post or something, and they would get coupons\nfor so many pounds of coffee and so many coupons for a camera, Leica camera and then you\ncan exchange one against the other.

        "A: Well, it's hard to answer that question. I did have a discussion with this Doctor Schwartz in\nParis about that. It's interesting that you should raise it. The Jews were receiving from the\nJDC equivalent of CARE parcels. They were parcels containing various things that they\nneeded, sugar, coffee, clothing, material to make [clothing], and the JDC was sending in\nmostly cigarettes, because that was the most negotiable item. And I discussed that with Joe\nSchwartz from a moral point of view. I said, \"Look, all the DP are now trading cigarettes,\nit's illegal, it's black market.

And he said, \"No. I think that, first of all, we get\nmuch more bang for our buck this way.\" You know, this was the currency of trade. The\ncigarettes were cheap, and you can buy a lot for it, and we need -- we're short of funds,\" as\nthey always were. \"Secondly,\" he said, \"it's an outlet for their emotions and they were\nreturned to normal life once they are taken out of this atmosphere.\" So that my concern was\nthat their moral standards would be destroyed by engaging in illegal activities. They would\nlose all respect for law. And I couldn't persuade him was the end of it, and in retrospect, he\nprobably was right, because in order to survive, legality was rather irrelevant. They were\nliving in an unlawful world, an unlawful state. And they did whatever they had to do in\norder to survive, and in that kind of atmosphere to come as I was inclined to do, being a\nlawyer, with notions of strict legality, was unrealistic and perhaps unfair. And I was overly\nconcemed about that. Anyway, the black market did, in time, as the economy improved,\ndisappeared. I'm not sure that it did any big harm anywhere.

        "A: That seems to me to be perhaps the most important, or next to the most important phase of\ndealing with Holocaust problems. Holocaust begins with stopping the Holocaust. Wars are\nholocausts, worst forms of holocaust. The next phase is to hold accountable those who\nbrought it on. These are the war crimes trials. The third phase is trying to restore what had\nbeen destroyed or taken during the war, that's the restitution program, and then the next\nphase is the victims. What about the victims? People tend to forget in the drama of the\ncourtroom, they think ah, the criminals are punished; it's over. It's not over. The victims are\nmore important than the criminals. Criminals can be punished or killed. It doesn't make a\nbig difference unless it's a deterrent to the repetition of the crimes. But what do you do about\nthose who survived? And this was a problem which was not addressed by military\ngovernment except in the very crudest way of seeking compensation for time spent in a\nconcentration camp, but it's much more complicated than that. The victims suffered all kinds\nof losses, and if you approach the problem legally, then it requires a completely different and\nmuch more expanded approach and that was the next thing that happened. If you want me to\ntell you about that now, I'll tell you how it began, and how it was approached. The notion\nthat the individual survivors of Nazi persecution, Jewish or non-Jewish, should be\ncompensated for their injuries is an old notion. It was quite obvious to anyone who was\nconcemed with the subject, and people had begun to write about it in Israel, in the United\nStates, about compensating victims of personal injuries. Germany was eager to reenter the\nfamily of nations.

He was able to that through a banker in London by the name of Noah Beru (ph)\nwho established first contacts with the German government, this is the post Nazi government\nsaying let us try to arrange something. Nahum Goldman was involved very early. Noah\nBeru was connected to the World Jewish Congress. Nahum Goldman was president of the\nWorld Jewish Congress, which he had created, and the very skillful negotiator and a very\ndiplomatic person really, and the first question was: are the Germans serious? No one\ntrusted the Germans, but the feeling was, look, what are the options? To let them get away\nwith it and walk away and say nothing? There was a Biblical phrase that was used \"Thou\nshalt not kill the victims and steal their property and get away with it.\" It was the same thing\nwith compensation. It was behind the restitution programs. But compensation is something\nelse. Compensation is payment for individual injuries sustained. And Adenauer, of course,\nhad to clear with his government. He was conservative, CDU, Conservative Democratic\nUnion'\u201d. The socialist were more inclined. They themselves had been Nazi victims, many\nof them. And so, the first thing that was necessary was to test their sincerity, and Goldman\nsaid look, I want to have a commitment of a minimum of a billion dollars, maybe it was a\nbillion marks. Goldman never knew the difference between dollars and marks. It had to be a\nbig figure. If it's a billion, that's a lot. The Germans didn't know what a billion was because\nthey called it a Milliard, a thousand million. Anyway, Adenauer was able to give him\nassurances that after clearing with his Parliament that the negotiations would be serious and\neventually the agreement was reached that we would enter into negotiations. But\nnegotiations would have three parties. One the German government, by that I mean the\nWest German government. The East German government never answered.\nCommunications were sent to them.

And the\nagreement was reached that negotiations would be entered into on neutral territory. No\nJewish organization wanted to go into Germany. I started to say there were three parties. On\none hand the Germany government, on the other hand, the state of Israel. The state of Israel\nat that time was a very new state. It had a lot of enemies. The whole Arab world was aligned\nagainst it, and they need someone to represent the Jews not in Israel, because Israel never\npurported to speak for Jews who were not in Israel. And who was to speak for them? Most\nof the Jews were not in Israel. They had fled. Polish Jews, Russian Jews, German Jews, so a\nthird party was necessary, and Goldman had the genius to put it together in what he called\nThe Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. It began as a Conference and\nthen kept the name Conference. It should have been committee or something else, but it kept\nthe name and it consisted of a collection of the leading Jewish organizations in the world, the\nWorld Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, The American JDC, Central British\nFund, The Jews of Argentina, The Jews of France. They all came together and formed a\nNew York corporation called The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany,\nand they were going to be the third negotiating party. So that the Germans would be\nnegotiating with all the Jews of the world and the negotiations would take place at a secret\ndestination in a neutral country. To give you some idea for the feel for it. There was a big\noutcry in the Jewish community, particularly in Israel: this is a betrayal of Jewish honor.\nYou are selling my mother. You are trying to get money for blood. Those who do this will\nbe betrayed by the Germans. The only good German is a dead German. We want nothing to\ndo with them.

They had sent a letter bomb\nto the head of the German delegation. To give you a little closer feel of what this is like, the\npreparations for this meeting took place at the Grosvenor House in London for about a week\nbefore we were going to go in, and we were then trying to prepare the opening statement. I\nwas there as counsel to the claims conference, because I was the director of the JRSO, so I\nknew about restitution. I knew what had happened more or less and so I was an expert, so\ncalled, in the field. There were other experts who were much more expert than I in the fields\nof reparations and so on. I think Hemmy Robinson (ph) and his brother Jacob Robinson\nwere really very learned international lawyers coming out of Lithuania, but we had a crew\nwas working in the Grosvenor House 1n London trying to prepare the opening statement and\ndecide on what theory and what are we asking for, and how do you justify it. Since my wife\nand I had parachuted out of plane over Berlin some recent time before, I was not eager to fly\nto wherever the meeting place was to be, and it was rumored that it was to be in Brussels.\nSo, I said, \"Look, tell me. I'll get there by train.\" And I was told when we left the Grosvenor\nHouse, you'll be given an envelope. Don't open until you get into the taxi and when you get\nthere, then open it and follow the instructions. We were under the security guard of the\nIsraeli Secret Service, and I opened it up and it said proceed to Hoek von Holland. I went to\nHoek von Holland. I said it's a strange way to go to Brussels, but I figured as much that you\nknow it's some other destination. And there I was checked out the customs. I came in and\nthey looked at my passport, looked me over and Mr. Ferencz, yes, just a moment, and then\nthey had some man come out of the back room and said come with me and I sat in a big\nblack buick and off we drove into the night.

Dawn was\nbreaking, we pull in to what looks to me like an old castle. It was . And it\nseemed to me I see SS men with police dogs there. And then my heart just sunk into my\nstomach. The Einsatzgruppen defendants had been executed not long before and I thought I\nhad walked into a trap. There was a Nazi on the ground as well. But as I looked a little more\nclosely, what I first glanced over SS were the Dutch Police. They wear the same type\nuniform. Black uniform without the death head and without the silver stripe on the pants.\nAnd when I noticed that very quickly and I realized it was not a trap. But I came in, I\nchecked in at the desk; this castle had been converted to a hotel, a first-class hotel, and I was\nassigned a room. What I was told was open no drawers. Open no doors. There's a\npoliceman stationed on every floor, and if there's anything suspicious, don't touch anything.\nImmediately alert the policemen on every floor. And the German delegation came in,\nheaded by Professor Franz Bohm, and Otto Kuster, whom I had mentioned and Bohm\nreceived a letter bomb envelope. A letter bomb envelope is an ordinary looking envelope\nwhich has a paper inside and at the bottom of it there is black powder and a detonator so\nwhen you pull it out the detonator explodes the powder and it will kill anybody who has it in\ntheir hands or anybody nearby. That was intercepted by the Israeli police and we were told,\nbe careful, because we knew that a member of the Stern Gang and the Irgun had entered\nBrussels looking for us and was already in Holland. They had been tracking him. So, it was\nfilled with a lot of apprehension. There was a plane coming in from Israel with two Israeli\ndelegates, crashed over Frankfurt, crash landed and killed everybody on the plane. We don't\nknow that there was any connection. We did not have any advance notice of that, and I don't\nknow to this day. It may have been just an unfortunate coincidence. I hope it was. But it\nwas an area of high tension.

And what we're trying to do is create a sense of justice for the injuries. The\nGermans coined the term \"Wiedergutmachung,\" which literally means make good again.\nBut you can't make good again, this kind of injury. All you can do is try to ameliorate it to\nsome extent. And then I felt, and the others who were connected with it, was a moral\nobligation as well as a legal obligation. If you injure someone, you owe them the duty of\ntrying to make recompense as best you can and to heal them as best you can. And that\nproblem continues to this day: the Japanese use of comfort women and so on in other parts of\nthe world. It's a continuing problem, but at that time it was new. No one had ever done this\nbefore. No one had ever sat down after a war to provide individual compensation to the\nvictims of not only that war, but the persecutions related to it. And to work out the principles\nand to set up the machinery and to put it into legislative form so that it will be passed by a\nparliament and be enforced by a whole series of judicial instruments and courts and agencies\non an enormous scale, I mean millions of claims, Jews and non-Jews. This was not strictly a\nJewish program. No one should mistake that. The Jews were the primary targets and\ncertainly the worst targets, -- although the gypsies were close behind of the Nazi\nextermination programs -- but there were very many other victims including German victims\nand it would be a mistake to disregard them. And we didn't disregard them in trying to work\nout the compensation laws to indemnify them for their injuries. We never made a distinction\nbetween Jews and non-Jews. They all had equal rights under the law.",

Three billion marks was to go to Israel to help cover some of the costs\nthat they had incurred in absorbing the immigrants of Nazi persecution, trying to rehabilitate\nthem. It was a global sum, which at that time was vital for the salvation of Israel. Germany\nhad no money. Germany was devastated. How do you pay it? It was repaid over a period of\nten to twelve years. The first payments were oil shipments. Israel was at war. What were\ntheir primary needs? The Claims Conference was to get five hundred million dollars for\ncompensation to the Jews outside of Israel. That was for organizational assistance. Then we\nhad, from these payments incidentally, the Israeli railroads were built. The Israeli electrical\nsystem was built in Germany. If anybody's been in Israel they know that taxi cabs are all\nmade by Mercedes. This was a great help, and it was rather ironic that the state which had\nset out to destroy the Jews was so helpful in fact in enabling the only Jewish state to survive.\nAnd it was so. And people like to forget it and say no, but it's an unfair thing to do. Then,\nwhat do you do for the individual? How do you measure? Well, we decided very early on,\nwe were not going to ask anything for loss of life. You don't take six million dollars or six\nbillion dollars for the loss of six million lives. But you do take the ordinary principles of\nlaw. Ifa child lost his father, who was his provider, and the provider was a high income,\nmiddle income or low income person he'd be entitled to compensation based upon that. But\nhe had to prove that he had a father, and that his father was murdered by the Nazis, that the\nfather had a certain income, that a certain portion of that income would have been used for\nthat child, that it would have been for that child for a certain number of years, that the\nGerman government should pay for it, that they should pay for it for a limited or permanent\nperiod of time, they should pay in whole or in part or a percentage. How much can they\nafford to pay? The Leistungsfahigkeit, the ability to pay, was the theme song. We have\nother obligations to pay.

        "A: Well, the Claims Conference was the umbrella organization acting as the voice of the Jewish\ncommunity. Nahum Goldman had obtained authorization, in fact, to speak for Israel, so we\nhad one voice speaking for the Jewish community, which was important. The first thing I\ndid was I set up an office in Bonn, to serve as a lobby to watch the Germans and see that\nthey carried out the program.

All you have to do is make friends.\" And I gave him a big American\ncar, which cost nothing because I got it from the Army and we had free gasoline and free\nlogistic support, and I said, \"I want to know what the Germans are thinking before they think\nit.\" And he was the man for that. He knew all the secretaries. He knew all the people in\nBonn. He was very popular. The problem was to persuade the Germans to make the size of\npayments and category of payments that we wanted. And the Germans didn't want to. They\nhad their own financial problems. The finance minister said, \"Look, this will bankrupt\nGermany. We can't accept these unlimited liabilities.\" At one time we even talked about\nrequiring every German to pay one mark a week or a month toward a fund so that they\nwould realize that they were paying compensation for what had happened in their name, but\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So, the Germans\nundertook, with great hesitation, different categories of payments. The German public was\ncompletely unaware. They felt no pain whatsoever as a result of these programs. Germany\nprospered and the losses were much greater than anyone had anticipated. We had made our\nappraisals beforehand and had estimated it would be six billion marks or nine billion marks\nand the Germans said oh no it's going to be 12 billion marks and we can't afford that. By the\ntime this program is over, it will cost the Germans well over a 100 billion marks. They\nalready passed the 100 billion mark figure. That, in today's dollar, at seventy cents a mark, a\nhundred billion marks would be about 70 billion dollars is what it would cost the west\nGerman government, now the reunited German government, to meet these claims. There\nwere literally millions of claims filed. I think it was three or four million claims, Jews and\nnon-Jews alike. Don't forget that these were not only Jewish claims. And the response we\nhad, the claims had to be proved in every case the individual claimant had to prove that he\nwas injured as a result, direct consequence of Nazi action. If he could prove that he was\npermanently disabled, he would get a lifelong pension, and they're paid now -- I don't how\nmany are still alive, but the last trme I looked at the count, a few years ago perhaps, there\nwere over a hundred thousand Nazi victim survivors, Jewish Nazi victim survivors, who\nwere getting life long pensions from the West German government. Most of these people\nare in Israel. The D-mark is very valuable currency. The Israel currency would fluctuate.\nThis was a life saver for them. In order for them to get recognition, however, they had to\npersuade the German doctors that the disability was caused by the persecution. That was not\neasy because for years they denied that there could be any mental disability caused if it did\nnot appear immediately on liberation. Many people, and anybody who was in the business\nwho knew the people knew it was so, managed to hold themselves together for many years,\nand then maybe five, ten, twenty years later, suddenly they would break down. By that time,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I must say they were hostile. And the German\nagencies that we had to deal with this were very often hostile. It depended upon the area.\nBerlin, for example, was known to be more liberal. There was a man in charge there named\nLipschitz who was very kind and tried to be fair. In Bavaria, we had nothing but troubles,\ntough fighting all along the way. And this required legal services of all kinds to help the\nclaimants. The claimants themselves never really understood. They said it's\nWiedergutmachung, why didn't they get more? What they got seemed to them to be paltry,\nand it was in many respects. And they couldn't understand that every case was different.\nThey'd say my sister got the same, and my friend, it was the exact, why did they get more\nthan I did? Well, there was always a reason. Sometimes it wasn't a good reason, but to have\nthem understand that was very difficult. So, this entire program, which expanded as we went\nalong, it was originally intended to be over by ten years, I knew it would never be over in ten\nyears, the laws had to be modified. They were expanded. Finally the Germans were getting\ntired of that and they called it the SchluBgesetz, the final law. Well after they got through\nwith the SchluBgesetz, it wasn't SchluB. They had to come with the hardship fund. And then\nafter the hardship fund they came with another hardship fund because every time you started\nto implement the program, you discovered the loss was much greater than you anticipated,\nthan any of us anticipated. And since Germany was prospering, and many of these payments\nwere linked to their own civil service, so that when their own civil servants got a raise in\ntheir pensions, the Jewish Nazi victims got not the same amount, they never got the same\namount, but something lesser, but they also got some raise. And so over the years these\npayments were very significant. And as I look back on it in retrospect, the program is still\ngoing on, but it should be over within the next ten, twenty years, as the last victims die off, as\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The awareness and recognition that\nthe wrongdoer has an obligation to his victim to try to help him; from a legal point of view,\ndeveloping the principles of compensation, the principles of law which should bind people\nunder similar circumstances. Which I hope are never repeated but which I fear are being\nrepeated. So, when you look at it as I look back upon it, I think it was a very great thing. It\nwas done in the name of all the Jewish organizations on behalf of the Nazi survivors. It was\ninadequate to make good again any of their suffering, but at least 1t was a gesture that\nsomebody cared. They had not been forgotten.",

        "A: No, the Claims Conference didn't handle claims except the hardship claims which came\nlater. But the claims had to be submitted to a German agency, and if you were not satisfied\nwith that you had again to go through the German judicial system up to the German supreme\ncourt and German constitutional court and the United Restitution Organization which was\nanother organization I was involved when it was set up and I was the director of that, we\ntook many cases to the German Supreme Court and had to take them to constitutional court\nto assert our rights.

        "A: Well, I think the fundamental story which disturbed me for many years was the German\nfailure to recognize the Spatschaden, the late claims. These ailments which would appear\nonly years later, several years later, particularly mental illness, but it was not only mental.\nPeople would suddenly get heart trouble and other things. And the Germans refused to\nrecognize that although medical science was beginning to recognize that people who had\nbeen subjected to trauma might have this late syndrome, which I may be a victim of myself,\nbut they began to recognize it when the German troops began coming home from the Soviet\nUnion. Suddenly they realized that these soldiers who had been subjected to the most\ndifficult circumstances while in Soviet captivity were suffering from mental ailments of\nvarious kinds and other physical ailments and they began to compensate them. Incidentally,\nthe payments made to German SS officers, their pension payments were vastly higher than\nany amounts given to Jewish survivors. Although they were important to the Jewish\nsurvivors, we don't want to exaggerate their importance in relationship to Germany's overall\nbudget and how much they would spend on their own, their widows of their own fallen SS\nheroes as they considered them. And SS officers. And so this whole category of mental\nailments was badly treated by the Germans, very badly treated for very many years, and\nmany people died before they could get any compensation, and it had to be reversed by the\nCourts. And some court decisions were outrageously unfair to the claimants.",

        "A: Well, this was all done in the name of the Jewish organizations, fortunately for them for\neverybody I guess, they didn't have to put any money into this because we generated all the\nmoney on the ground, from the first payment that supported all the meetings and all the\nsalaries and everything else.

There was no member of the German bar who was not a Nazi. It was a\nrequirement. If you were not a Nazi you couldn't be admitted to the bar. The prospect of\nJewish Nazi victims going to German lawyers and paying them in an effort to get\ncompensation, the nature of which was highly uncertain, and the value of which was highly\nuncertain was not something that they would do. If there were no agency to assist them with\ntheir claims, the whole legislative programs that we worked out would be meaningless. And\nso, we set up, by we, I mean again I was the director the JDC was the leading body, there\nhad been a small organization of German Jewish lawyers who had fled from Germany and\nset themselves up in England and they were handling some restitution claims for the return\nof property. They were being supported by the JDC and the Central British Fund and I think\nthe Jewish Agency. Very small payments and a very small program. And when I set up the\nprogram, I incorporated them. They were called the United Restitution Office. I called it the\nUnited Restitution Organization to retain the continuity. Their chairman was a very fine\ngentleman by the name of Professor Norman Bentwich, a distinguished Englishman, a dear\nfriend, an outstanding citizen. And then I expanded it with money that the Germans had\npaid. I borrowed from the Claims Conference a few million dollars and expanded that\noperation. The Claims Conference got the money from the Germans. I repaid it to the\nClaims Conference later and expanded the organization so that when I left Germany in 1956,\nI had a staff of 250 German lawyers, 1,200 people, offices in 19 different countries. Offices\nin every major city in Germany, in Israel, wherever there was large concentrations of Jews\nwho needed help with their claims, the United Restitution Office set up an office. In Israel\nwe had one in Tel Aviv and Haifa and Jerusalem and in the United States we had one on the\nWest Coast and in Los Angeles which still exists and in New York which still exists in\nPhiladelphia.

And these offices\nwere there to give assistance to claimants with no down payment a small contingent fee\nwhich enabled the organization to maintain itself funneling hundreds of thousands of claims\nthrough to the German agencies and in Germany we had offices in Frankfurt and Berlin and\nStuttgart and Munich and Cologne, and Mannheim, all around the place where they were\nGerman agencies dealing with these claims, we set up an office with lawyers of our own\nchoice. The heads of office were always Jewish lawyers. We didn't rely on German lawyers\nexcept as subsidiary staff and then we screened them. So, this was a very big operation,\nlargely unheard of. It worked very well, I must say. I set it up around 1951 and I resigned\nfrom that in 1992 or 1993 after about 40 years. In all that time, we dealt with hundreds of\nmillions of dollars and thousands and thousands of claims there was never a trace of any\nscandal of any kind.

We had no malpractice insurance, and we never had any\nindication of anything other than a clean and upright organization which did not satisfy all\nthe clients. Most of them felt they didn't get enough, but some of them did. They\nappreciated it. And it was also a very unique type of operation.

Well, as I told you, I had signed a document promising to repay it out of restitutions\nmonies when the monies came in. It seemed like a fair enough arrangement to avoid having\nto get consent from the Russians and the British and the French. When the money was gone,\nMr. Clay was also gone, General Clay was also gone, and Mr. McCloy was in his place. So,\nI went to see High Commissioner John McCloy. I explained to him, being an honest man,\nthat I had borrowed this million marks against occupation funds, and that I promised to\nrepay, but I said, \"Look, the money is just beginning to come in. There are other priorities.\nI'm trying to move the D.P.s out of the camps in Germany into Israel. In order to do that I\nneed the money to buy prefabricated homes which can be shipped from, at that time\neverything was under strict control, export import controls and I said I need the funds to buy\nthese prefabricated houses in Austria to ship them in Israel. Otherwise we're going to have\nthe camps blocked and all the rest.\" He said, \"All right, all right.\" \"I need some more\nmoney.\" He said, \"How much more do you need?\" I said, \"A million marks.\" He said,\n\"Can I do that legally?\" I said, \"I happen to have memo here that says you can.\" And he\nsaid, \"Okay, go ahead.\" So, I borrowed another million marks. To make a long a story\nshort, when that million marks was gone, it didn't take too long, I came back to him again\nand I said, \"Look, I know that I promised to repay, and that money is coming in, but there are\nother priorities. You shouldn't give priority to repay occupation funds.

Mr. McCloy, in his infinite wisdom or folly, granted clemency to a lot\nof convicted war criminals including my Einsatzgruppen boys, including Alfred Krupp, who\nhad been sentenced to seven years in prison as well as forfeiture of all of his billions of\nassets. I went to see Mr. McCloy. I said, \"Mr. McCloy, I know that I have promised to pay.\nThe debt is now three million marks. If you insist upon repaying it, I will repay it, but you\nhave just given a convicted war criminal three billion marks in assets and I don't think it's\nfair to ask the victims to pay the expenses of recovering a small portion of what was stolen\nfrom them.\" He said, \"What do you want me to do?\" I said, \"I want you to cancel the debt.\"\nHe said, \"Can I do it legally?\" I said, \"I have a memo here that says you can.\" He said,\n\"The debt is canceled.\" That's something about Mr. McCloy the Jewish organizations don't\nknow, some of them do, because I reported on it, of course. But it's not generally known.\nMcCloy was a great friend to the Jews in the whole restitution program. He was very, very\nhelpful in persuading Konrad Adenauer and the German government to be supportive of\nJewish claims at a time when Germany was totally dependent, financially and militarily upon\nthe United States and Mr. McCloy as_ former Assistant Secretary of War and High\nCommissioner of Germany, when he suggested the German leaders, whether it be Adenauer\nor whether it be some of the others that it would be in their interest to be more forthcoming\nin the dealing of Jewish claims, they listened. In one of his speeches he said this would be\nthe test of Germany's morality and their readiness to be rejoined with the family of nations\nwhat they did for the Nazi victims. So, I think that Mr. McCloy deserves recognition for\nwhat he did for the Jews as well as less criticism for his failure to bomb the rail lines in\nAuschwitz, which he thought would not help the Jews, would kill them more likely than not.\nAnd for his judgment in that he was not alone in.

        "A: Yes, there were several. Two major ones come to mind. There were others. One is these\nCatholic women who are victims of medical experiments the other is slave laborers which\nwe might want to spend another minute with. The Catholic women's story is fairly simple.\nThe Germans in the Ravensbriick concentration camp, used young Catholic women, they\ndidn't just select them because they were Catholic, it happened to be that they were Catholic,\nand used them for a variety of rather atrocious medical experiments such as cutting them\nopen and throwing sand and glass at their wounds to see how they would heal and how long\nit would take them before they died. These were experiments designed to simulate the\nconditions which German soldiers might face in various traumatic situations. And Germany\nrefused to pay them anything because there were no diplomatic relations between West\nGermany and the Polish government and one of the defects in the German compensation\nlaws was that it excluded political persecutees, and they excluded anybody from a\ncommunist country. Well, there was a lady by the name of Caroline Faraday who had been\nvery close to a French resistance group which was devout Catholic as well, and she came to\nsee me one day and she said that she heard that I had been so helpful -- I was then practicing\nlaw in New York -- I had come back -- in helping the Jews, why couldn't I do something for\nthe Catholics?

The women of Hiroshima who had been\ninjured by American blasts, atomic weapons, and who had been disfigured and who were\nbrought to New York where they were treated by Doctor Hitzik, a Jewish doctor, at Mt.\nSinai Hospital and given all kinds of plastic surgery and restored as far as possible as a\ngesture of goodwill from the American public to the Japanese. That has been a very\nsuccessful program in terms of generating goodwill and showing human compassion\nregardless of who the victims are. So, he was well known for that. He himself was a World\nFederalist, later president of the World Federalist Association, and he had important\ninfluence on my world thinking as well. Anyway, Caroline Faraday had gone to see him and\nhe said, \"Look, there is no legal basis for the claim. It's different. It's an involuntary action.\"\nAnd somehow she had found my name and she came to see me. And I agreed to help them.\nWe set up a little committee, Norman was the chairman. We brought in some publicist,\nsomeone from Life magazine and I approached the German government through the\nAmbassador in Washington, and he said, \"We can't pay, as you know. There's no provision\nin the law for it. We have no diplomatic relation with Poland. We're sorry, they have no\nclaims.\" I said it has nothing to do with the law. You injured these people, you owe them.\nAnd you're going to pay them. \"We can't, no basis.\" Well, we'll find a basis. So, we\narranged a high pressure publicity campaign. Pan Am lent us an airplane and we filled it up\nwith these women from Warsaw, young Polish women. We brought them to the United\nStates. I drafted speeches. Norman drafted speeches. Cardinal Spellman greeted them on\nthe steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, the gist of which was \"The women of Poland, we greet\nyou. The Germans are not paying you? How can they do such a terrible thing. After all,\nlook what they did to you.\" And then we took them to the Senate and we took them to the\nCongress, and every Senator who had a Polish voter and came up and made a speech on the\nfloor, and he began, saying \"Look what they did, these Germans, and they refuse to pay\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And I was on the phone every day\nwith the German Ambassador. \"Have you had enough?\" And finally he said, \"I have had\nenough. I'm sending a cable to Bonn. This is not a legal matter, it's a political matter, and\nthey better settle with these women.\" And I proceeded then to Bonn. And the Cabinet was\ntaking this up as a very special measure outside the law. The Cabinet by that time was very,\nvery annoyed with me because I had offices in Germany. I had offices in Bonn. I knew\nwhat they were thinking and what they were doing. And the word that I got from the middle\nof the cabinet meeting was that they are ready to pay, but to pay to you, because they think\nyou are a communist agent and you are just there to embarrass the German government. I\nsaid, \"To whom are they willing to pay? I don't care to whom they pay, they have got to pay\nthe girls. They said, \"Well, I don't know but they're not going to pay to you.\" I said, \"How\nabout the Red Cross?\" They said, \"Oh, yes, the Red Cross they will pay.\" So, the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, and I said, \"Fine, just have them pass a resolution.\nThey'll make payment to the International Committee of the Red Cross. I will be in Geneva\nand I will take it up with the Red Cross.\" And they did. So, off I went to Geneva and there I\nmet with a M. Momaunoir, the International Committee of the Red Cross and I explained the\nsituation. The Germans are willing to pay, but they would only pay it through the Red\nCross, and would the Red Cross be willing to accept this as an obligation. The Red Cross\nwas much smarter than I was. I was ready to settle this with the Germans for I don't\nremember, five million dollars or something like that, because we only had a list that high, of\nmaybe a 100 girls altogether. And in comparison to what the Jews were getting 5,000 marks\na head, it was a symbolic payment. The Red Cross said no we can't accept limited liability.\nWe can't accept a closed ended deal.

Fine, I went back to Bonn, you got a\ndeal, bang, and we made the deal. Special Cabinet resolution. The nice end of the story\nwhich delights me, proves that I was a total fool that I would be willing to accept a\nsettlement for five million dollars. By the time that they got through paying that program, it\nmust have cost them fifty times that much. I would go past a buddy of mine in the Finance\nMinistry and say how many claimants do you have now? We only knew about 100. A\nthousand, 1,200, 1,500 they came from Czechoslovakia, from Poland, from Austria, from\nHungary. All the medical experiment victims came and the Red Cross said that was the deal,\nand they kept on approving them and they kept on getting paid. And the minimum payment,\nI figured out, I arranged that the payments would be made in Swiss franks as well, so it didn't\nget worthless zloty and the people could go abroad in order to get medical treatment. They\ncould spend their money abroad. And the minimum payment was what a college professor\nin Poland would have earned in two years time. So, it was a great thing for these Polish\nwomen, and one of my most touching moments in my whole experience in this business was\na group of them waiting at the airport in Poland to greet me when I came as a guest as the\nPolish government to express their appreciation for my effort. So, that was one of the\ncategories of claims outside of the normal range, and there were many others.

It's been translated into Japanese. It's been the basis of a good\ntelevision show, and I would hope that something could be done. There are many others if\nyou shake my memory a little bit.

As I indicated Jewish congregations\nwere state organizations. They were entities of the state, and if a school teacher, an\nelementary school lost his job or stayed long enough, he got a pension. If he was a teacher in\na Hebrew school, he should have been entitled to the same pension. But the Germans said,\nno, no, no we can't do that because we don't know who would have been entitled to a\npension. How should we know now? All the schools were closing in 1933 and whether the\nRabbi or the , or the moyl or the ritual all the people who are involved in\nJewish congregation and religious life, whether they would be eligible for pension, we can't\nknow that. So, I countered. I said, let's make a global settlement for I think it was 30 million\nmarks and then we'll distribute. Oh no, we can't do that. I said, all right we'll make another\ndeal. We will set up an advisory committee to check the claims first and only when we\ncheck it and say that it's okay will we pass it on to you, and you can check it again if you like\nand we will only approve those cases where we think the man would be entitled to a pension.\nThey bought that, much to my relief, much to their regret. Because we then set up small\nadvisory committee of former German Jews mostly, I was the Chairman of that committee,\nand we received of thousands and thousands of applications of people who would have been\nqualified or felt they would have been qualified for a pension from these Jewish\ncongregations. And we approved those cases and we passed them on to the Germans and the\nGermans paid. It was not under the Finance Ministry but under their Social Ministry. The\nMinistry which deals with this type of problem. I say partly to our shame, there were many\ncases where we turned down the claim, and they could appeal to the Germans and the\nGermans approved it, so that although we were correct in our determination of eligibility,\nthere were cases where the Germans felt well, we had turned it down, but the man would\nhave been entitled. For example, a typical type of case would be a rabbi left Germany, fled\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

He worked for two years. Was he a career employee of the\ncongregation so that he would have been entitled to the pension, or was he only a temporary\nemployee? Some of the members of my advisory board said, no, no, under no circumstances\nhe should never expected a pension. It was only a temporary thing. I always voted in favor\nof the claimant where the matter was in doubt. If it was a tie vote, I think we were five, if it\nwas two and two, I always cast in favor of the Claimant. But many cases we turned down\nand the Germans said yes, we'll pay them. So that's an example of Jews being overly\ncautious and the Germans being a bit more generous in a completely different category of\ncase outside the normal range of the law, and of course, it cost the Germans very much more\nthan we had originally anticipated in the beginning.",

        "A: The German industrialists had a rather unique attitude. They began by denying that it ever\nhappened. The attitude was \"What? We employed concentration camp inmates?\" Next,\nthey denied that they were in any way responsible or connected with it. \"Ah, perhaps they\nwere assigned to us by the SS. It could have been, but the conditions were really very good.\"\nSo they denied the conditions. Then when you pointed out the conditions were really very\nterrible. \"Ah, we were not responsible for that. We did the best we could under difficult\ncircumstances.\" Then the ultimate payoff was \"Well, you know, if it hadn't been for us, they\nwould have gone directly into the gas chamber. So, by our providing work, we saved their\nlives. Why are they complaining to us? They owe us.\" That essentially in summary was the\nattitude of all the industrialist without exception, despite all the denials since that time which\nhave appeared on television and on radio shows and on all kinds of other shows and it was\nthe universal response of all of them, without exception. Now, I had a little incident, my\nknowledge of what had happened came largely from the Nuremberg Trials against I.G.\nFarben which built Auschwitz, against Krupp, a big user of slave labor, against Flick, who\nwas a big industrialist who had many companies using slave labor, armaments firms and\neverything else, automobile companies; and in Nuremberg we had collected the\ndocumentary evidence of this and the documentary evidence showed what the truth was.\nHow many people they employed, where they employed them, what the conditions were,\nhow much they paid the SS for the laborers, 1t was a few Pfennigs, and what they had to do\nin order to qualify to receive inmates. And they showed very clearly to me that you had to\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

You had to be engaged in industry which they\nconsidered important, you had to be sure to provide security either by sending your own\npeople to be trained as SS guards, by the SS to put barbed wire all around the particular plant\nwherever they were working. Post the proper security guards and other security measures to\nbe able to maintain them on the level which was tolerable to the SS, which means minimum\nconsumption, maximum production. Failure to do that is the equivalent of being shot dead\nor treated as a saboteur. So, they had to comply with all that before they could even be\nconsidered for getting labor. I'm not talking about right after the beginning of the war and\npeople were seized on the street and put to work on rubble. I'm talking about regular forced\nslave laborers. And I had all the documentary proof including the decrees from Albert\nSpeer, who was the Minister responsible for the armaments industry and for the allocation of\nlabor. And the industrialist with whom I had met -- LG. Farben, Krupp, AEG, Siemens,\nTelefunken -- all of them took the other line. So when Krupp came out of Spandau Prison\nafter twenty years, now Spandau Prison is in Berlin. It's an old big, 1t doesn't exit any more.\nThey ripped down when Hess, who was the last prisoner who died there. This was a big\nfortress of a prison for these few Nuremberg defendants. And Speer spends twenty years\nthere and every three months they rotate them. Russians the French, the British and the\nAmericans, and the Russians were not kindly deposed to any of those prisoners. He came\nout and I arranged to meet him at the airport in Frankfurt secretly. And it was not easy for\nme to shake hands with Albert Speer. But he spent twenty years and in the interim he had\nwritten several books about his memoirs and in those books and at Nuremberg as well he\nhad indicated remorse for what had happened and was prepared to assume responsibility to a\ncertain extent for having been involved in supporting Hitler's programs knowing very well\nwhat was happening to the Jews and other forced laborers, and there were other forced\nlaborers as well. So, I asked him, I said, \"Look, I have a question. I come to see you with a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I have all your documents, your decrees, I have the requisitions, I have the reports\nfrom the concentration camp commanders. I have reports from the SS people who are\nresponsible for the allocation of labor, and they all tell me one thing, and one thing\nconsistently and only, that all of these industrialists were fighting to get these inmates and\nthe conditions were equivalent to death. They could only survive a given number of months\nin that kind of labor. And that this was known to all of them and yet they all deny it. How\ndo you explain that?\" He said, \"They're lying.\" And I said, \"Can I quote you?\" And he said,\n\"Yes, you may.\" And I wrote the story in the book Less Than Slaves and I sent him a draft\nof the manuscript beforehand. I said \"Mr. Krupp\u201d, is this a correct statement? If so, please\ninform me. If it's wrong, please correct it.\" And he wrote on the margin \"Einverstanden\";\nagreed. He changed nothing. So, that was an interesting thing. And you know when some\nof these fine industrialists representatives of Mr. Krupp and the others were asked about this\nlater, after we made these paltry settlements with them, which I described in the book: \"Oh,\neverything was fine. You know, we had a moral obligation\" and so on. But in truth, they\npaid as little as they could get away with. They didn't pay a penny more than they had to,\nand the real payoff and revealing their true attitude is what they did for the non-Jews. In\nconnection with the I.G. Farben settlement, a certain point in the negotiations the question of\nnon-Jews came up. A gentleman by the name of Langbein, had been a head of the group of\nAuschwitz non-Jewish survivors\u201d. He had been agitating for compensation for them too.\nAnd the I.G. Farben people said we only have a limited pot. We'll pay thirty million marks,\nwe can't afford to pay more. You divide it. So they pitted the Jews against the non-Jews to\ndivide it. And then the argument was what was the ratio in the camp at the time of\nliberation, and when I was in Poland as a guest of the Polish government in connection with\n* Correction: Mr. Speer.\nThe rllowine onan an gbein wa s the head of the Internatig nal Aus chwitz Committee. at not this transcript.

It's a big\nbeautiful building and we finally reached agreement on a contract, and in the contract they\nsaid, without recognizing any legal or moral responsibility, and I said \"What do you mean,\n\u2018no moral responsibility\u2019? You don't want to recognize any legal responsibility, which is what\nthey all wrote into the contract. If you don't have any moral responsibility, why are you\ndoing it?\" And he said, \"Well, that's the way we want to put it.\" And I said \"Why didn't you\nput down the truth? Why don't you put down that you're doing this because you feel you're\nbeing intimated and blackmailed by the Jews? Write that into the contract and I'll buy that\nand I'll sign that agreement.

And for that reason they gave as little as possible. They were\nnot concerned with helping the Jews. They were concerned with helping their companies\nand helping Germany. And they were not concerned with saving the Jews, they were\nconcermed with saving Germany during the war. And the rest of it is boloney, pure and\nsimple, and nobody should believe it.\n[Tape break]\nMay I correct something? I inadvertently misspoke, it was Mr. Speer who was in Spandau prison\nfor twenty years, not Mr. Krupp. Krupp was sentenced for seven years, got out in less time\nand was then allowed to go free with his fortune thanks to Mr. McCloy's generosity.

        "A: There were no real problems. We met with Langbein on occasion, but there was no massive\nmovement, because the inmates themselves were unaware that these negotiations were\ntaking place, and in fact when we later distributed these funds, we found very often the\ninmates came and filed claims when in fact they had not worked for that company or did\nwork for that company but not in a plant which was authorized to receive compensation.\nAnd we had to engage on a voluntary basis, persons whom we knew had been there for a\nlong time, and they would form a screening committee and invite the claimants in in\ndoubtful cases and try to confirm that they had actually been there or not been there. And\nthere were many cases where the inmate through error or a moral feeling of what difference\ndoes it make if I worked for Krupp or Schmidt it was the same kind of work in the same\nplace in the same time and the same beatings and the same starvation, why should he get it\nand not I? And morally they were right, but we couldn't do anything about it. That was the\nterms of the contract, so we screened them out, always kindly. We never accused them of\nmalice or theft or corruption. We said, we're sorry you're mistaken.

        "A: My feelings expressed at that time have not changed. I am a lawyer. That is all I've ever\nwanted to be. I felt that Nuremberg trial and the Einsatzgruppen case in particular was an\nopportunity and an obligation to advance the rule of law that if it's going to have any\nsignificance, 1t has to have more than merely executing 22 people for murdering a million\npeople. You cannot compare, there was nothing that could be done to these defendants that\nwould expiate in any way the magnitude of a crime of that size and I struggled with that\nproblem as a young man but at that time, because it was expected as the French headlines\nsaid that the prosecutor would come in and say \"I demand their heads. Je vous demande les\ntetes\" 1s what some French papers falsely stated as my opening statement. It was never my\nopening statement nor did I have such feelings. But it had to have some significance, some\npermanent significance otherwise they died for nothing. And the idea of creating a rule of\nlaw where all persons -- when I talk about mankind, I meant womankind as well, we weren't\nas sensitive then as we are now -- where all persons could live in peace and dignity\nregardless of whatever their race or creed might be and that idea remained with me and it\nremained with me until this day. I would say that most of my life, not all of it, was dedicated\nto trying to make that a reality. There's a certain bit of madness in that. One human being\nsets out and says \"Look, let's see what we can do to make this a world in which those\nconditions exist. And when I was about 50 years of age, my kids were already grown, and I\nfelt well, now I can dedicate myself full time because I didn't have to be so concerned about\nsending them off to college and meeting all their expenses and all the rest, and I thought I'll\nfocus now on that.

That\nwas my main pitch of my Nuremberg Trial. Crimes Against Humanity, that humankind has\na right to be protected from this kind of slaughter and abuse simply because of your race or\nreligion. And so crimes against humanity was the things that I was interested in and in a\ncourt to condemn such crimes. And there was no court. After Nuremberg and the\nsubsequent trials, there was no such court. Crimes against humanity were committed in\nmany places: in Biafra, in Vietnam and in all kinds of places. Nobody talked about a court.\nNobody talked about punishing the most outrageous crimes. Millions of people were being\nkilled and the international community was looking the other way, including the Jewish\ncommunity, I'm ashamed to say. They didn't care. It was not them, it was somebody else.\nVery little Jewish concern. So I began to work on an International Criminal Court, and the\nUnited Nations was already working on that problem, ever since Nuremberg, but had made\nno progress. And they made no progress because the Nations didn't want it. And they said\nuntil they had a definition of Aggression there was no use in having a court because\nAggression is the biggest of all crimes. And that they had been fooling around with the\ndefinition of aggression for 30 or 40 years with no progress so I decided to work on a\ndefinition of Aggression first to get that out of the way.

        "A: It seemed to me to be a bit absurd that the International Legal community was unable to\ndefine Aggression. I began to work on that problem. When I work on any problem, I do it\nthe same way. I begin from the beginning of time and read and study everything that has\never been written or said, and I began to lobby at the United Nations where there was a\nspecial committee appointed to define Aggression and was going nowhere, and I got access,\nI obtained a pass to the United Nations. I obtained several passes of various kinds and was\nable to go to all of the meetings. And I met with the delegates and I presented papers for\nthem and I coached them and I spoke with them and I lobbied with them and I wrote articles\nin all law reviews and things of that kind. To make a long story short, they finally agreed on\na consensus definition of Aggression. An interesting sidenote, I knew it was coming it was a\nGood Friday, it was 1974, I think, and I came home and I said to Gertrude, tomorrow you\ncome with me to the United Nations. They're going to reach a consensus definition of\nAggression for the first time in 50 years. It will be the legal committee, the Sixth Committee\nof the United Nations Special Committee on Aggression. And I took her there and sure\nenough a few minutes had come and it had already been prepared and we vote upon a\nconsensus definition of Aggression. I said \"Look around you.\" We're in one of these big hall\nof the United Nations. Nobody was there. It was in the evening. The two of us were sitting\nin the rear section of the hall, and I said, \"You see, this entire hall the only two people who\nare not paid to be here are you and me\", and it was a historic occasion. And I immediately a\ntwo volume book on the definition of Aggression which spelled out the background of all of\nthis and this became a classic work on the definition of Aggression. Then I said, now we can\ngo on to the International Criminal Court and that obstacle had been gotten out of the way\nand they began to work on a court and they were getting absolutely nowhere.

This laid\nout the history, the documents, the background the argumentation for it, how you can create\nsuch a court and everything else. That book came out in 1975, right after the definition and\nnobody read the book. Nobody paid any attention to the book. Well, all right, I tell them\nhow to do it they're not interested. How do you enforce international law? So, I wrote a two\nvolume book on that and somebody said, \"Why do you keep writing books in two volumes?\"\nAnd I said, \"Because my typewriter is so high I need something to sit on and I need two\nvolumes.\" And of course that was only a joke. It was in fact all the documentation, all the\nhistory, everything was there. Going back to ancient days, and it was a very useful took and\nthat was what it was intended to be. It was my notebooks. And when I got through with\nthat, still nobody was paying attention. I wrote another book Common Sense Guide to\nWorld Peace. I wrote Planethood. I wrote another book -- I called in the Russians and\ncompared notes with some Russian experts and I kept writing books and articles and going\nto the United Nations and going to all these meetings, keeping abreast of what was going on,\ntrying to influence it, and nothing much was happening. And crimes were being committed\neverywhere and sometimes I thought I had gotten the governments moving in Bangladesh\nwhen thousands of women were being raped, they said they were going to set up a court and\nI was advising them on that. They didn't pay me for it, but I was advising them for it, and\nthen in the end they said let's have reconciliation and forget it. And of course the crimes\ncontinued. Then something very interesting happened. In Yugoslavia, there we had\ngenocide all over again. Before that, we had Saddam Hussien, a clear case of aggression, a\nclear case of all kinds of war crimes, a clear case including rape, pillage, murder,\nenvironmental depredations, which had not been listed as a crime before, but all kinds of\nthings and the international community did nothing.

You have betrayed half a\nmillion young American people who risked their lives to go out into that desert and then you\ndidn't have the courage to follow through and do what was needed to be done in order to\ncreate a more peaceful world or order by punishing those who are responsible for the crimes.\nInstead you're punishing innocent civilian population. Your sanctions starve them. He\ndoesn't go hungry. And I began to scream and television and radio and every place I could\ngo. Not many, because most people are not interested. They're interested in scandal and\nthings of that kind: rock stars, football players. They're not interested in scholars. However,\nalong came Yugoslavia where genocide now called ethnic cleansing got very popular and\nmass rapes got very popular and the United States said we can't get involved. Our fingers\nwere burned in Somalia. We don't want to do what we did in other places, in Lebanon. The\nUnited States government was opposed to an International Court was opposed to doing\nanything, but because of this medium because of television and the opportunity of the public\nto see people get on television and say as I heard one man say, a Serbian soldier, he said:\n\"Yes, I've raped dozens of Muslim women, but then I cut their throats because that's what\nmy commander told me to do.\" And the women of America, God bless them, began to\nscream \"Do something.\" And the U.S. Government for the first time said we have to do\nsomething. What can we do? The Court, let's set up a court. We're not going to send troops.\nLet's set up a court. So they set up a court for Yugoslavia. All crimes in Yugoslavia, limited\nto Yugoslavia and limited to after 1991, which is of course preposterous. It so happened,\nthat when the General Assembly approved the draft statute for that Court, I was in Geneva at\na meeting of the International Law Commission. I'm not a member of that Commission. I\nwas there doing my usual type of lobbying.

We need a permanent international\ncriminal court, and I'm still working on that, because there's this big gap in the international\nlegal order. My latest book, New Legal Foundations for Global Survival: Security Through\nthe Security Council, is a comprehensive bringing together of twenty years of careful\nthought and I share that with the public. All of my royalties I have given away to peace\ngroups. I will not make a penny on that book any more than we did with the book\n\"Planethood\" which was written with Ken Keyes, who incidentally is a quadriplegic and\ntotally ignores it. No penny for him and not a penny for me. That book is out to educate the\npublic on the need for planetary thinking, if we're going to have a peaceful world. There will\nbe no peace for anyone, anywhere until there it peace everywhere and that is my conviction\nand in this last book I tried to lay out the blue print specifically including the security council\nresolutions that are needed in order to achieve that goal. And it is feasible. And it's feasible\nwithout amending the U.N. Charter, and I'm afraid to tear up the U.N. Charter and start\nagain, because I see the anarchy that comes in places like the former Soviet Union and\nYugoslavia, and it's too dangerous. Too many people will die before we can pull the thing\ntogether again. So, I'm ready to try to make it work within its existing framework by\ninterpreting the laws and by laying out new rules to make the Security Council a more\ndemocratic and fairer institution than it is today, and that is the gist of my thinking and of my\nnew book. And now that I am approaching the age of 75, I hope the time will come for me\nto close my book and say this is my effort to create a more humane and more peaceful world\nso all may live in peace and dignity.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

It's something that happens, and it's not\nsomething which requires my patience. I have no patience for anything else. So, I can't\nexplain that. I really can't explain that. It may be a trauma. It may be one of these delayed\nsyndromes that they write about. But it's harmless, I hope; and I function quite well.",
        "A: I have one here. It's interesting that my wife Gertrude, who was then not my wife, she was\nonly my can't say girlfriend, I don't know what the appropriate term. She was my\nsweetheart, my darling, it says here. She saved all the letters that I wrote from the front,\nincluding the scene in the concentration camps as I came in, many of the camps. And of all\nof these letters were saved, they're over 50 years old, in their original envelopes. At that time\nyou were not allowed to write where you were. You were not allowed to describe, and I had\nsmuggled these out by some means which I don't even remember anymore, but I was\nprobably giving it to some officer who was going to another country to put it in a mailbox or\nsomething. So she has them with the envelopes with the stamps on them, and all of these\nthat relate to the Holocaust have been given to the Holocaust Memorial Museum. They can\nbe found there in more detail. But here's one which I think is reasonable typical. It's only\nthe covering note of a very much longer report. I don't know how many pages the long\nreport is, but more detail and I say here this is a case I wrote about long ago. This is dated\nJune 14, 1945. I must have written about in May while the war was still on. \"I was in the\ntown of Stammsreid (ph), near Chom, Germany\" -- I know that, near the Czech border --\n\"when liberated French P.W. told me about having to dig a hole by order of the SS.

The old lady at the nearby farmhouse told me about seeing the SS herding a\ngroup of weary men into the woods. They were part of the 15,000 who had been marched\nout of Flossenburg concentration camp headed for Dachau as the Americans approached at\nthe end of April. The farmers wife heard the shots as they rang out at brief intervals. The\nfarmer and his sons made sworn statements about how they had covered the bodies with dirt\nin order to prevent disease.\" I took those affidavits from them. \"I sent the photographer to\nthe spot. And here you have the results.\" I must have enclosed pictures. I'm sure I did. I'm\nsure the Holocaust Memorial Museum has those pictures of the bodies that I helped uncover.\n\"Hope they won't scare you, but the pictures can only give a small indication of what\nactually it was like. I just want to get the things off my hands. Use them in any way you\nlike, dear, and I hope they won't keep you awake. Will write a decent letter later. P.S. Just\nin case you can't find that other more detailed letter, these murdered men were political\nprisoners of every nationality and were murdered simply because they appeared to be too\ntired to continue the march successfully. The SS beasts didn't even wait for these men to\nfall, they just marched them into the woods for slaughter.\" These were non-Jews, Jews of\ncourse were included as well. So, on that happy note, I thank you for the opportunity to\nrecord this piece of history and we hope the next world will be a better one. I thank you all.\nEnd of Interview.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.
