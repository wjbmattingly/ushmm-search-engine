At one time it was Gunsburg, G-U, with an umlaut, and B-U-R-\nG. But we've gone by Ginsberg now for the last 60 years, I'm sure.",
        "Q: Thank you for elaborating on that. Can you tell us where you -- when you were\nborn and where?",
        "A:Yes. I was born April the 10th, 1933, in the town of Moravska Ostrave in\nCzechoslovakia, sometimes known as Maehrisch-Ostrau because German was spoken\nthere, also. It was actually part of Moravia.",

        "Q:uestion: Was it -- are you talking about Czechoslovakia or when we moved to\nLondon?",

        "A: Well, Czechoslovakia, it was Czech, but also sometimes German.",
        "Q: Okay. But no Polish, because your mother is from Poland?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Okay. What was the occupation of your parents?",
        "A: My father was, actually, a fur merchant and he had a business. In those days, that\nwas Okay. Now fur merchants aren't regarded very well. And my mother used to work\nin his business. He was actually Q:uite successful and owned property, actually\nowned property in Berlin and had a house for his parents in Szinov where he was\nborn, and traveled a great deal all over Europe and even to Canada. This is all pre-\nwar, of course. And he did end up on business in London before the Germans\ninvaded, but we were there and they would not allow us to join him.",
        "Q: Did you have any siblings?",
        "A: Yes. I had a wonderful brother by the name of Oskar, O-S-K-A-R, and,\nunfortunately, lost him at a very young age of a heart attack. But he did survive and\ngo to England and then America with us.",

        "A: He was born November 16th, 1928.",
        "Q: What else do you remember about him?",
        "A: He was a fantastic, wonderful, giving young man. We were very close. As\nyoungsters, of course, he used to tease me. But we had a very, very wonderful\nrelationship where he lived -- after we came to the United States and after I was\nmarried and moved out to California, we would travel back and forth, send\nchildren back and forth, our children to visit. He took my sons up to Yosemite when\nhe came out for a Bar Mitzvah. We celebrated weddings, of course, and Bar Mitzvahs\nof our nephews. And they came out to celebrate things out here in California with us.",
        "Q: So he -- right. He moved from England to the -- or he stayed in England when you\nmoved to the U.S. or no?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, he actually came to the U.S. on his own as a teenager. He was 19, I believe,\nand he came on the Q:ueen Mary. I came with my parents. I was 15 when we came\nfrom England to America, and that was in 1948.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But he preceded us \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- by a little while.",
        "Q: We'll talk more about your time in England, but first I wanted to know more -- do\nyou remember -- what else do you remember about Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Well, interestingly enough, I find it hard to believe, but I remember the Germans\nmarching in. We lived in a very lovely apartment in Czechoslovakia -- in Moravska\nOstrave. And I was only six -- not even six years old, but I do remember the Germans\nmarching in in the Mercedes Benz. And to this day, we have never ever considered\ngetting a Mercedes Benz, which, I guess, doesn't make a lot of sense. But it was a --\nsomething that I remember seeing the Germans, you know, with the Heil Hitler with\nthe arms out and the soldiers. And certainly not understanding what was going on,\nbut knowing something was really wrong.",
        "Q: And how old were you then?",
        "A: Six.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's talk a little bit more about your family life before the Germans\narrived. Did you live in an apartment or a house?",
        "A: We lived in an apartment. Czechoslovakia, as opposed to Poland, was really",
        "Q:uite modern. It was a very modern city. And later on I may talk about a\ncousin of mine who visited Czechoslovakia as a child, and then after surviving\nAuschwitz, was on the death march and marched through Czechoslovakia and\nremembered. And he has written a book, which I'll discuss later on. He now lives in\nIsrael.But we were really Q:uite well-off. But we had -- since my mother worked, we\nhad people to help take care of me and my brother. And we had a really lovely\napartment with lovely furniture. And I went to a kindergarten. It was actually a\nJewish kindergarten. I still have pictures, you know, all dressed up for Mother's Day\non tricycles and -- it was -- it was a very, very nice life in Czechoslovakia for my\nparents and, of course, for us until everything changed.",
        "Q: So you and your brother had a nanny. What about maids? Were there maids as\nwell to help out?",
        "A: We had -- yes. Yes, we had people -- yes. In fact, even someone who cooked and -\n- yes, we did.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We lived pretty comfortable in those days.",
        "Q: And what special occasions or holidays did you celebrate?",
        "A: My father -- Q:uite religious in fact -- Heschel Shabbat. And I don't know if you\nknow what that means, but he observed the Sabbath. And, of course, we celebrated\nFriday nights and had Shabbats dinners and all the holidays. You know, from\n(?casa?) always and Purim. Purim was a big thing, especially as a child, you know,\nyou get dressed up. And my mother was a very modern lady and she had been a skier\nand they had been in Paris. And I have pictures of them and -- not on the actual Eiffel\nTower, but, you know, one of the funny pictures with an Eiffel Tower and them\nhanging out of it, my father and my mother. They were amazing parents, both of\nthem. Just amazing people up until the very end. Unfortunately, as you'll hear, my\nfather died Q:uite young after what he went through. But my mother lived to be 89\nand was a truly amazing lady.",
        "Q: Okay. What else do you remember about the city before the war started?",
        "A: Well, not really that much. I mean, I remember that I went to a school, like a\nkindergarten. And we used to go to the park and things were very nice. It was pretty\nmuch an industrial city. Right now, I think it's -- I haven't been back there. We've\nbeen back to Prague several times with my husband. But I've not gone back to\nMoravska Ostrave. And I've heard, you know, that there's a lot of pollution because\nthere are factories and coal burning things. So we haven't -- I haven't gone back there.\nBut, as I said, we have been to Czechoslovakia, to Prague, and to cal -- (?Calurvi?)\n-- it was called Bard, (ph) but it had a different name in Czech.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Saleveece barry (ph) I think.",
        "Q: And what were some of the activities that you and your brother participated in\ntogether?",
        "A: In Czechoslovakia?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Really --",
        "Q: I know you were Q:uite young.",
        "A: Not much because he was older and he was in school, and I, you know, played\nwith children. And just like here, you know, if you're in kindergarten, your activities\nare a little different than if you're four years older. But we did visit our grandparents\nand we had visitors from, as I mentioned before, my cousins Zvi Barlev, whose book\nby the way, is in the Holocaust Museum. I donated it. It's in several different\nmuseums. He did write about his experience, so --",
        "Q: Do you remember the title of the book?",
        "A: Yes, it's called \"Would God it Were Night.\" His name is Zvi Barlev.",
        "Q: Can you spell his name for us?",
        "A: Z-V-I, and the second name B-A-R-L-E-V. However, that's his Israeli name. His\nPolish name was Bleicher. B-L-E-I-C-H-E-R. And --",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: And the book actually talks about the ordeal of a Jewish boy from Krakow\nthrough Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Gusen, Gusen. And it talks about the death\nmarch after Auschwitz, you know, before it was liberated, and his walking through\nthe town that he visited when he was a boy.",
        "Q: I assume you attended synagogue?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You said your family was religious?",
        "A: I am avery active member of synagogue here in Riverside, yes.",
        "Q: And do you remember how many other Jews were in your area at the time?",
        "A: Oh, wait a minute. Are you talking about Czechoslovakia?",
        "Q: Sorry, yes.",
        "A: That I don't remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We -- Iremember London very well, the synagogue, because I used to go with my\nfather all the time. But in Czechoslovakia, no, I don't remember. But we definitely\nwere members. In those days, as I said, my family, my father in particular, was\nOrthodox, my mother not as much.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, in Czechoslovakia, do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism\nbefore the Germans came in?",
        "A: I don't. I don't.",
        "Q: Have you -- has anyone told you -- did your parents tell you about any?",
        "A: No.As opposed to things that were going on in places like Poland and Lithuania,\nno. Czechoslovakia was -- no. It was only formed between the World Wars, and it had\nreally progressive governments and it allowed the Jews, you know, to own property.\nAnd my father, as I mentioned -- I mean, at the age, I think, of 24 bought an\napartment house. Actually, the apartment house was in Berlin. You know, so, of\ncourse, those were times when there was, you know, major problems economically in\nGermany. So -- but he was a very -- well, he was a wonderful man, but he was a very\nastute businessman.",
        "Q: So let's talk about when the Germans came in. Do you remember when that was?",
        "A: I think it was in March of 1939. It may have been a little bit earlier, but I think it\nwas in 1939. Actually, Czechoslovakia was given -- land was given to the Germans\nin 1938, but I don't think they marched into Moravska Ostrave until 1939.",
        "Q: Okay. You said before that you remember that. Can you tell us more about that?",
        "A: Well, I find it difficult to believe this myself, but I was in the street, maybe with a\nnanny or something or with the maid. You know, somebody, not my mother. And I\nremember the cars and I remember the Germans coming in.And then a very\ninteresting thing is that a German came over to me and there was like, a candy store\nright there. And I was a cute little child, and he said to me in German -- I spoke\nGerman at the time -- that I have a little girl like you at home, and actually took me\ninto the candy store and bought me a piece of candy.I mean, that's the kind of thing --\nyou know, it seems really a weird thing to remember, but that --",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else about him?",
        "A: No.No. And, obviously, he wasn't in one of the cars, though, he was probably\nmarching. Because it was a whole, you know, like, a march into town. And it was a\nbig city, I mean, it was a cosmopolitan city. I don't know how many people, but, you\nknow, it had cinemas. It was a very contemporary city.",
        "Q: Do you remember what happened after he bought you candy?",
        "A: No.He just went on his way and I probably was taken upstairs.",
        "Q: Okay. So you lived near the candy store?",
        "A: Yes, the candy store was very close. And maybe that's what we were doing\ndownstairs. It's hard, I was six.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But it's amazing, even to me, that -- well, you know, it's a pretty momentous\nsituation. I mean, there's so many things that I don't remember later, although I do\nremember -- well, we will go into that, how we left. And that was an amazing\nsituation, too. But you probably will want to ask me Q:uestions about that.",
        "Q: Yeah, definitely. We'll get into that in a little bit. Do you remember anything else\nabout when they came in?",
        "A: No, I don't. Because after that, I don't -- things didn't change that much at that\npoint. I mean, I think I still, you know, went to the kindergarten and -- at that point.\nYou know, later on, of course, it was totally changed and the children were sent to\nRavensbruck. Most of them, you know, was murdered. But in the very beginning, it\nhadn't hit yet.",
        "Q: Okay. So in March they -- you remember them coming in, and then when did you\nleave for Krakow?",
        "A: Okay. Now, it's very difficult for me to give you an actual date, but let me tell you\nhow we left for Krakow. The Germans -- my mother wanted to take us to England\nwhere my father was. And there was no way she could get permission, but somehow\nshe was able to talk -- now, you know, this was something that I found out a lot later\n-- to someone in the German, well, authority -- and she was a charmer. She was an\nabsolute charmer. And she was able to talk them into her taking her two children to\nvisit her father who was dying in Krakow. That was my grandfather. He was actually\ndying, he did have stomach cancer. And so we just put on clothes, you know, a\ncouple layers of clothes and went on the train and went to Krakow. The amazing\nthing is, that she was able to ship things to London. You know, which is an unusual\nstory, because, you know, usually you just leave everything and that's the end of it.\nBut to this day, I have menorahs.My daughter now has beautiful candlesticks, and,\nyou know, many things. And I was asked if I would donate stuff to the museum, and,\nactually, I want to keep it for my children, and grandchildren --",
        "Q: Of course. Of course.",
        "A: -- to have.But she -- she was able to ship things.",
        "Q: So she shipped the items before you left for Krakow or to London?",
        "A: Yes -- no, to London, to my father.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- but then when we left, we left with nothing and went on the train and went\nto Krakow. And she stayed with my grandfather and I was taken care of by, you\nknow, my cousins and aunts and my brother, too. And my grandfather died. And he\ndied, actually, I guess it was beginning of August of 1939. And she sat Shiva.\nI don't know if you know what that is, Shiva is the seven days that you sit after\nsomeone dies.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then she tried to talk her sisters and brothers to let her take their children to\nLondon. And everybody said, no, you know, he's got Czechoslovakia and that's going\nto be it. You know, he's -- you know, that's -- and they -- nobody left except for my\nmother, my brother, and I. And we went across Poland and went to a port called\nGdynia at the time because it was part of Poland --",
        "Q: Can you spell that for us?",
        "A: G-D -- gu din (ph) -- N-I-A I think. Gud (ph) -- oh, Y. Let me just write it out.\nThe thing 1s that that port changed many times. That port was called Gdansk and also\nDanzig when it was part of Germany. Danzig. And Gdynia would be G-D-N-Y -- gu\ndin (ph) -- A I think.",
        "Q: Okay. Thank you.",
        "A: I'm not sure. And Gdansk is probably easier to spell. It's G -- gurs (ph) -- D --\ndunk. G-D-E-N-A-S-K I think.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: But it's been -- you probably can look it up. Danzig the different names that it's\ngone under. You know, these things went back between Germany and Poland. So we\ntook a ship and went across the English Channel --",
        "Q: So this is your mother, yourself, and your brother, correct?",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "Q: And how did she get permission to leave?",
        "A:Poland?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: She -- I don't think she -- I don't know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't think -- you know, it was still -- you know, she had a passport, I think, and\nyou were able to travel in Europe. I mean, this was before the Germans invaded and -\n- I mean, my father had gone to England from Czechoslovakia. They traveled all\nover, all over Europe.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so, you know, they had passports or whatever they needed to travel.",
        "Q: And what was your father doing in London?",
        "A: He went on business, you know, to -- no, my father went on business. But my\nfather was a worrier, and that will explain what happened to him later. And he, I think,\nforesaw that things were going to happen, and so he went to, to England on business.",
        "Q: Okay. So he was the one who instigated you coming across to London to meet\nhim?",
        "A: Right. Right. Oh, absolutely. I mean, we wouldn't have gone otherwise. He -- he\nhad gone. And I can't tell you how long he was there, but I can tell you that when he -\n- we came there, he was only 39.He was in the hospital with a heart attack. So the\npressures and the strains, you know, of the family -- and between my father and my\nmother, they were able to get us over there.",
        "Q: Did you need special permission from the British to stay there?",
        "A: No.That's such an interesting thing because the British -- actually, there were\nmany refugees that came to England. Most countries, including America, including,\nyou know, so many countries, even in South America and Australia, you know,\nnobody really wanted the Jews to come. But my father was there on business, and it's\nnot just -- we then made friends with a lot of other people. In fact, I'm still a close\nfriend of somebody who came from Moravska Ostrave that were close friends of my\nparents. The name was Winer, (ph) and she's now married. Her name is Honey\nArnold. She's still alive and she's in England. And we're still in touch and close. We\nvisit there and they visited here. And they came to London. And there were probably\noh -- not dozens -- there were many, many people that came to England.\nAnd that is amazing. I don't know, because I know the British have not always been\nwonderful, they were very difficult. We were in London at the time of Israel being\nestablished, and certainly the British were pretty bad about letting Jews into Israel.So\nwe were just very lucky. We did have an -- my mother had an aunt there, her sis --\nher mother's sister lived in England for many years. And so we actually lived with\nher for a little while until we got established in England. But that was not an easy\ntime either, because it was wartime and the Blitz and everything else. But, you know,\nthese are things that, as I got older, you know, I remembered more things about what\nhappened and our evacuation and the bombings and going into the underground\nshelters. And so it was a difficult time, but as children, you sort of adapt to what it 1s.",
        "Q: We'll talk about -- more about the Blitz in a minute. Can you first tell us -- did you\nhave other family members that stayed behind in Moravska?",
        "A: Yes. Well, actually, in Szinov. My two grandparents, my father's -- my father was\nan only child, and the only family we had were his parents. And we used to visit --\noh, that was something I forgot to mention. As a child, we used to go out to Szinov\nand they had a big garden with fruit. And we used to go and pick berries. So we had a\n-- really had a very nice childhood in the beginning. Well, it was pretty short. But\nthey stayed there and, unfortunately -- well, maybe fortunately for him, my\ngrandfather also passed away. But my grandmother, Ella, her name was Ella Brenner,\nhis name was David Ginsberg, she did not survive and was killed by the Nazis.",
        "Q: Was she deported to a concentration camp or --",
        "A: Yes. But, actually, not from Czechoslovakia. Because of my mother's big -- my\nmother had a very big family as opposed to my father. She actually went to Krakow,\nand from there she was deported. And I don't know exactly where or when, but she\nwas killed, as was my mother's mother. They were both killed by the Nazis, as were a\ncouple of my mother's siblings and some children, so...",
        "Q: If you -- we do some research here at the museum, so if you're interested in\nfinding out more information, we might be able to look that up for you.",
        "A: Well, that would be great.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Her name was Ella Brenner -- well, Ginsberg.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my other grandmother was Erlich, Eva Erlich, maiden name of Corow. (ph)",
        "Q: And I think after the recording, maybe if you can email me the information, and I'll\npass it on to the researchers here.",
        "A: Well, that would be very, very good. Yeah. My cousin, by the way, Zvi Barlev\nwho ended up, besides writing the book, being with the Israeli Diplomatic Corp.He\nwas -- after all he'd gone through, he was first secretary in London.Actually, it was in\nBuckingham Palace with the Q:ueen. He was also first secretary in Sweden and lived\nin Stockholm for a while. He did a lot of research. And we, actually, you know,\nhave a -- he put together a family tree. Not so much of my father's side like Ella\nGinsberg, but of the Ehrlich side, which was my mother's maiden name.",
        "Q: Did you spend a lot of time with him growing up, or was he a different age?",
        "A: He was older. He was, you know, Q:uite -- well, several years older, and not that\nmuch. Because he lived in Krakow, he visited us and we visited there. But it, you\nknow -- a visit would be a short visit. But I've been very close to him. We've been to\nIsrael now 26 or 27 times. And so, you know, we've been in touch. And they've been\nhere.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because he -- as I said, you probably can find the book at, you know, at the\nmuseum. So that -- but there are a lot of books that have been written, but, of course,\nthis one was published -- I guess it was a self-publish thing by Vantage. And it did\nhave a forward, actually, I think, by Elie Weisel even.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was translated from the Hebrew, not only into English, but into Swedish and\nNorwegian. And so the book was in a few different places.",
        "Q: When you first came to London, did you live in an apartment there?",
        "A: No, we went to live with my great aunt. It was my grandmother's sister. We lived\nwith her. She had a house at Six and Andrews Grove in Stamford Hills. And we lived\nwith her because my father was in the hospital, as I said, with a heart attack. But once\nhe recovered, then we moved into an apartment at Two Stamford Hill Mansion.And\nthat's where we lived until -- I mean, we lived there the whole time, but I was -- we\nwere evacuated part of the time.",
        "Q: Where did you go when you were evacuated?",
        "A: A village, which is now a bigger town, called Kennington, outside of Oxford.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Kennington --",
        "Q: Was that just you and your brother?",
        "A: And my mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my father used to come on the weekends. He would be working in the city.\nHe was still working, he had his business. But terrible, terrible strains. Terrible\nstrains, you know, trying to keep the family as safe as possible. In fact -- and I\nmentioned this to Ashley, but I will tell you, I guess, it was in 1940 things looked so\nbad in England. And we thought that -- the Germans had invaded everywhere -- that\nit looked like they might be coming into England, too. So my father, being the\nwotrrier that he was, said we're going -- we had an uncle in America. He said we're\ngoing to send the children to America. And we stood in line and applied for all the\npapers that you need for that and got everything and were scheduled to take a ship\nand go to -- actually, I think it was Canada, but then America. It left from Liverpool.\nAnd that ship was sunk, and, I think, 70 some odd children died on that and other\npeople. But at the last minute, my father decided we're stick -- keep the family\ntogether. So even though we had all the papers to go, we didn't go.",
        "Q: So it would have just been your mother and you and your brother on the ship and\nhe would have stayed in London?",
        "A: Actually, I think it would have just been the children, just my brother and I. You\nknow, like -- it was like the Kindertransport, but it was a little different. You know,\nit was something that they were trying to arrange to get kids out of England when it\nlooked very dangerous.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I don't know about my mother at that point, but I do know that we had all the\npapers we needed. And then the discussion with the family and my father said, no,\nwe're going to stay together.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else about that, what he explained to you about first\ngoing on the ship?",
        "A: Right. He said, you know, I -- that the family needs to stay together, but we'll try\nand stay safe. And we did in those days of the Blitz. It's an amazing thing, Heather,\nbut the kids used to like to go down into the Underground because they'd run around\nwith all their friends. You know, children are amazing, I mean, how they adapt to\ndifferent things. And we would go into the shelters, you know, when the sirens would\ngo off.And then we'd be with other kids and other friends. And that -- they sort of\nlearn to adapt to the situation. And it was interesting because a lot of schools closed.\nBut there was one school that stayed open, and it happened to be a convent, a\nCatholic school. And, of course, I was Jewish, as were a number of my friends, and\nthe convent allowed us to come. And not only allowed us to come to the school, but\nwe had asked if when they had their catechism and everything else, could we have a\nJewish teacher come in and they allowed us to do it. So for part of the time -- and I\nended up with a very -- even though I was evacuated and in Kennington in a one-\nroom schoolhouse with my brother, who was four years older than I was, and then\ncoming back to London and going to the convent, by the time I came to America --\nwe're getting ahead of ourselves -- but I started high school. And because of the years\nof education I had, they put me in as a freshman. But after I was there for six months,\nI became an upper junior because of all the subjects we'd already had, even during\nthe wartime.",
        "Q: Okay. And we'll talk more about that in a minute.",
        "A: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Q: That's okay. Can you talk more about -- did you understand what was going on in\nLondon at the time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you understand about that?",
        "A: We understood that the Germans were bombing and were hoping to come into\nEngland. And we really felt, maybe because where we came from -- the British may\nnot have felt this way, maybe they felt a little stronger, you know, that no one 1s\ngoing to come in here. But after seeing what had happened in Europe, there were\ntimes that we really thought that the Germans would come in and invade Britain or\nLondon.",
        "Q: And did you understand why they wanted to come in?",
        "A: I understood that Hitler wanted to rule the world and get rid of the Jews, one of\nthe things that he wanted, one of the main things that he wanted. And the amazing\nthing is that somewhere or other they said that somewhere in his background there\nwas some Jewish blood. And, you know, sometimes those -- you can get Jews\nsometimes that are so self -- not that he was Jewish, I'm not trying to say that. But\nthey can be self-hating and worse than anyone else against the Jews. We did\nunderstand that, as Jews, we were very vulnerable.",
        "Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism in London?",
        "A: Well, I know there was anti-Semitism. But when I think about my experience at\nthe convent and the friends that I made and that -- one of the gals that was in my\nclass actually became the mother superior, and I visited her on one of our many visits\nto London. I really had very positive feelings about, you know, how other people\ntreated us.",
        "Q: How did you know that there was anti-Semitism if you didn't experience it\nyourself?",
        "A: Well, I imagine -- I knew what happened. Well, I didn't know at that time about\nthings like the concentration camps. But I knew that -- that's a good Q:uestion. I don't\nknow.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Okay. Maybe it was --",
        "A: But there definitely was anti-Semitism in London. I mean, I've read many things.\nYou know, people resented the Jews coming in and taking jobs away and things like\nthat. So I know that it definitely existed. But we happened to live in a very Jewish\narea. It's even more Jewish now than when we lived there, Stamford Hill. And so our\nfriends with Jewish -- now, there was a Catholic school there, but we belonged to a\nsynagogue and attended services and really participated in Jewish life there, again,\ncelebrated the holidays. Friday nights my father would bring home people for dinner\nwithout even talking to my mother. So we'd always have guests at Friday night\ndinners. And things were rationed, but somehow we managed. In fact, I remember my\nparents never eating an egg because they wanted to give -- we got two eggs or\nsomething -- giving the eggs to, you know, to my brother and me. They figured we\nneeded them more than they did. So we had, really, you know -- they were difficult\ntimes. And we certainly didn't have the same kind of life that we had in\nCzechoslovakia. My mother was not working. But, you know, she had to clean the\nhouse and clean the floors. And I'd help her, you know. So it was a different, different\nlife, but still --",
        "Q: Was your father working?",
        "A: Yes, my father was working.",
        "Q: And as a fur merchant or --",
        "A: Yeah, still in the fur business, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else about that?",
        "A: He had a partner, I remember, Arpud, (ph) and must have done okay because, you\nknow, we had food as much as we could, you know, with rationing. We had a kosher\nhome. We were always --",
        "Q: So you managed to keep a kosher home?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. Interestingly enough, and at least in London. And in Kennington, I have no\nidea because they had never seen a Jew before. And when we came there, they\nactually wanted to know if we had horns. And, again, my mother, ended up charming\nthem. She'd invite them over and she'd bake strudel and stuff. And there we were\nbilleted or lived with an Anglican minister in his house, you know, when we were\nevacuated, my mother, my brother, and I. And when my father came, he would stay\nthere, too, and --",
        "Q: Was it just him or did he have a family?",
        "A: No, he was single. His name was Reverend Williamson. And he particularly, I\nmust say, liked me. That might sound difficult today. But as long as we lived in\nEngland, he would never forget my birthday. And he was very kind to us, too. So,\nyou know, it's interesting, you know, with all the anti-Semitism going along, the\npeople that we dealt with were very kind.",
        "Q: Did you meet a lot of other people in Kennington as well?",
        "A: Oh, yes, I did. We lived next to a girl who became one of my best friends there by\nthe name of Marge Hoggnet. (ph) I've lost touch with her. She eventually moved to\nAmerica. But I -- I tried to locate her. Not Jewish, they were farmers. And they had\nchickens and they actually had sheep. And I actually helped with -- I didn't really\nhelp, but I was there and they let me do some sheering of sheep. And so it was, again,\na different -- very nice people. And they -- a lot of it had to do with the way that my\nmother behaved and, I guess, the way we behaved. And we -- there was only a one-\nroom schoolhouse, you know, where all the kids went to school together. As I said, I\nwent to school with my brother, but -- who was four and a half years older than I\nwas. But we had a schoolhouse.",
        "Q: Were you in the same class?",
        "A: Yes, it was just one room. Oh, yes, just one class. It was just one class.",
        "Q: So you went to school in Kennington and then a different school when you were\nin London?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And how long were you in Kennington?",
        "A: Well, we were there two different times. One was earlier, you know, when the\nBlitz was really bad. And the second time -- and I don't know the exact dates, you\nprobably can look that up -- when the buzz bombs came over and they decided it was\ntoo dangerous to stay in London. The buzz bombs were the ones that you could hear,\nand then when they stopped they would drop and blow up whatever they landed on.\nAnd that was later, you know, maybe in '43. The first one was maybe around\n'40, '41.",
        "Q: Do you remember how long you were in Kennington each time, was it months or\nyears?",
        "A: It wasn't years. It would be several months. Because we would go to Oxford, and\nnear Oxford there was actually an American Air Force base and we used to see the\nYanks. And there was an expression that the kids there used, got any gum, chum.You\nknow, just -- you know, it was something that we would say if we met an American.\nAnd I did meet a couple of them. But, you know, how old was I, 10, 11, something\nlike that. We were young.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else about the Americans on the base?",
        "A: We didn't ever go to the base. They were just young, nice guys. You know, this was\n-- actually, let's see, America went into the war in '41, so the first time -- I don't think\nthey were -- the first time we were there, I don't think they were even at war yet. But\nthere were some American soldiers that did come to Europe. And there was a base --\nand I don't know exactly where it was -- but it was somewhere near Oxford.Oxford 1s\na beautiful city, very historic.",
        "Q: So what else do you remember about the Blitz and --",
        "A: Well, after it was over, we would go outside and we would try to collect shrapnel.\nNow, none of the buildings where we lived, you know, were hit or blown up. But\nthere was -- you know, there was a lot of damage. And one of the things that we did\nas kids is we would go out, you know, and collect shrapnel.",
        "Q: And did you find a lot of it?",
        "A: We found some. Found some.",
        "Q: And who did you collect it with?",
        "A: Other kids, other children that I was friendly with. Like, even this girl that I\nmentioned to you, but there was -- there were other friends, you know, that we made\nas youngsters, you know, from school, from the neighborhood. Usually it was in the\nneighborhood.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk amongst yourselves about what was going on?",
        "A: In the war?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we did. I don't think we realized how, how horrific it was in Europe,\nyou know, as children. Certainly my parents did. And I know that they did\ncommunicate for a little while. There was a ghetto in Krakow where all the family\nwas, including the grandmother. And they got a picture of her -- that's my mother's\nmother. And -- but as I mentioned to you, my father, you know, the stress and the\nstrain was really tremendous on him. Tremendous. And --",
        "Q: Your grandmother was able to write to your mother, though?",
        "A: In the beginning.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In the beginning, yes. But, you know, then things got much worse. And we didn't\nreally talk about these things like -- we always had dinner together. And I think my\nparents tried to have us have as normal a life as you possibly could. One of the things\nthat was rather interesting was that, as a youngster -- and this is when I -- I don't even\nremember at what age -- I developed appendicitis and I didn't want to admit it. And,\nactually, it ended up rupturing. This was the days before penicillin.And my father,\nwho is very religious -- and, as I said, we were as kosher as we could be, you know,\nand we were.You know, we kept separate dishes and -- for whatever food we had.\nAnd when I was in the hospital -- I'll never forget this -- and they didn't have much\nmeat or anything else, and the only thing they had was bacon. And he said I want you\nto eat that because it's more important, you know, to save your life than to worry\nabout kosher.",
        "Q: How long were you in the hospital for?",
        "A: Good Q:uestion. You know, it's funny how you remember some things and don't\nremember others. But it was ruptured and I was very, very sick. As I said, there were\nno antibiotics at that time. And it was probably at least a couple of weeks.",
        "Q: Do you remember what year that was or how old you were?",
        "A: No.Isn't that funny? I don't. But I was little, maybe nine. Eight, nine.",
        "Q: Do you remember being underground during the bombing?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how -- can you tell me more about that?",
        "A: Well, there were different ways that we could be underground. There were\nshelters, which were near the apartment. And people from the apartment would go to\nthe shelter and stay there until there was, you know, there was a siren, and then there\nwas an all clear siren. So you would go to that. But the ones that I remember the most\nis when we went into the Undergrounds, which -- have you ever been to England?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Then you know how deep they are. And we would go down to the Underground\nand actually sleep down there. And you're going to ask me how often did we do that,\nI don't know, but it was Q:uite a few times. And as children, we actually -- I'm not\ngoing to say had -- but we actually, you know, we went around and saw our friends\nand -- it's such a strange situation where you live in a difficult situation, but you kind\nof adjust to it.",
        "Q: What was the environment like down there?",
        "A: A lot of people, and, you know, with blankets and they would sleep down there.\nAnd all -- you know, families would sort of stay together. And it wasn't that often that\nwe'd go into the Underground. But thefew times that I remember, it was not that -- it\nsounds like an awful experience, but it wasn't. I don't know how to describe that.",
        "Q: Did you bring food with you?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we'd bring some food with us. Yeah, maybe sandwiches or something,\nwhatever. Whatever you had because there wasn't that much available. Talking about\nfood, another thing I will remember always is my father buying me a peach for two\nand six pence, which was a lot of money. That was a Q:uarter of a pound. And it was\n-- you know, it was something I just remember, because fruit -- you know, it was\nhard to get fruit.",
        "Q: And that was something you took down there into the Underground with you \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- to eat?",
        "A: No.That was the time that we were actually in the West End and somebody was\nselling fruit and he bought it for me. We still did things, you know, I went with my\nfather.",
        "Q: And, at this time, you were also still going to school, correct?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yeah, I went to school all the time that we were there. And we had --\nyou know, we had to work hard and study hard. And we had good teachers. Some\nwere nuns, some were not nuns. I remember a Sister Ursula who had a very good\nsense of humor.",
        "Q: Now, what else do you remember about the nuns?",
        "A: Well, they were strict. You know, on my report cards -- which I think I still have\nsomewhere -- it was -- I was a very good student at the time. I usually -- this gal who\neventually became mother superior and I were always like, first, second in the class.\nAnd on my report card, I'd have all these nice grades. And then on the conduct, it\nwould say very good conduct but she talks too much. So I guess I'm still doing it.",
        "Q: And your brother was not in the same class with you at this time, right?",
        "A: No.No. No. This was an all girls' school. He was in another school and he had a lot\nof -- he was very social and he had a lot of friends, too. | And I remember the\nfriends, and, you know, they were handsome young men. And they used to, you\nknow -- used to bother them and they would always sort of try to get rid of -- from all\ntheir activities, I guess. That's the way, you know, it is with brothers that are older.",
        "Q: So outside of school, do you remember spending a lot of time with your brother?",
        "A: Not that much. Because he -- you know, he was with his friends and I was with\nmy friends. And we did spend time at home. And when we were in Kennington, we\nwere in the same school. And he put up with me.",
        "Q: Now, what was London like after the war?",
        "A: Well, it -- 1945, you know, things slowly, slowly started getting better. And, of\ncourse, this is where -- by that time, I was 12 and --",
        "Q: Do you remember when the war ended?",
        "A: Ended? Yes. Yes. And there were, you know, big celebrations. And -- but then the\nthing that I remember a lot is how I felt as a Jew with the fact that Britain was not\nallowing, you know, Jews to go to Israel. We were -- oh, I was part of a youth group,\nand it was a Zionist youth group. It's called B'nai Akivah.",
        "Q: Can you tell spell that for us?",
        "A: B'nai is capital B, apostrophe N-A-I, Akivah is A-K-I-V-A-H. Named after Rabbi\nAkivah. And we had a lot of activities. I even went -- after the war, I even went to a\ncamp, you know, which was like, in the country with this group, you know, where we\nwould do a lot of, you know, singing and dancing like, a lot -- and other activities.",
        "Q: Do you remember where in the country?",
        "A: I don't. I don't remember where it was, but it was the country. And there's a lot of\nbeautiful country not far from London. You know, whether it's Somerset or -- a lot of\nvery nice places. And so we were very committed to, I guess, to Zionism. My father\nactually attended the last Zionist Congress, which is the 12th Zionist Congress. That\nwas the last one. I think that was in 1920-something. It was after World War I. And\nmy mother, too. I mean, she was in Israel. She went to Israel in 1948. She was on one\nof the first boats that went to Israel. Actually, she sat at the table with Leonard\nBernstein's parents and remembered the conversation of how disappointed he was\nthat his son didn't go into his business. That's Leonard Bernstein, musician, of\ncourse, I'm sure you know. And 1948, we saw her off to go to Israel for the first time\nright after it was established as a state. And she went many times. And once we were\nable to, my husband and I, as I told you, we've been there many times, too, and have\nremained very close to, not only Zvi, but we had three other first cousins that\nsurvived and ended up in Israel. One has passed away, two are still alive.",
        "Q: So would you consider that your parents were very politically active?",
        "A: They were great supporters in any way that they could of Jewish causes,\nsynagogue, of Zionism, of Israel being a Jewish state. And so in that way, I mean,\nthey -- my father went to the Zionist Congress, but I don't remember -- you know,\nthere weren't anymore after that. So I -- you know, and I don't think he was that\ninvolved in organizations. He was more involved in the synagogue. He went to\nsynagogue every Saturday and --",
        "Q: And this was in London or --",
        "A: No, in London and then in New York. Unfortunately --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- in 1948, he went to the synagogue. He had an aliyah and he had his last heart\nattack and he died. And he was only 52 or three. So he got us through all this stuff\nand brought us to America and he died. A tremendous loss. Then my mother carried\non in the most amazing way with my brother. And I'm the only one that actually was\nable to go to college. I worked, but went to school and graduated. But my brother\nworked with my mother. They opened up a store and were successful again.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They did very well financially. I mean, I shouldn't say very well, you know, they -\n- you know, were able to live very good lives. As I said, my mother was able to\ntravel, go to Israel, see her family. But, as I've said a few times, she was probably one\nof the most amazing people I've ever known.",
        "Q: Well, I do want to hear more about your brother and your mother in New York.\nBut just going back to London for a minute, you said your father had a heart attack in\nLondon in 1948, is that true?",
        "A: No.No. He had a heart attack in 1939 when we came there and he was in the\nhospital. Then he did not have another heart attack. He suffered, though, you know,\nin walking. He had angina. And -- but he worked and he traveled back and forth, you\nknow, to Kennington and did all the things. And helped me when I was in the -- was\nthere for me when I was in the hospital. And then my -- we came to America and my\nmother had a brother here living in New York City. And at first, we lived with him\nfor a very short time.",
        "Q: What year did you come to the U.S.?",
        "A: 1948.",
        "Q: Do you remember how that you received permission to travel?",
        "A: No. But I know that they got all the papers that we needed. And I guess because of\nmy uncle and my father's, you know, business connections, we were able to come.\nBut not until after the -- you know, this was three years after the war ended. I think\nthey actually wanted to come to America earlier, but as I had mentioned to you, they\ncouldn't come -- oh, I didn't mention this. But they were Polish, both of them were\nPolish, and the Polish Q:uota -- there was a Q:uota system here -- and the Q:uota was\nclosed and they couldn't come in. My brother and I were Czech and the Czech Q:uota\nwas not closed. And that's why we were able to get all the documents that we needed\nto come here on that children's transport, which was sunk. So originally they were\ngoing to send us and then they decided -- my father particularly decided he wasn't\ngoing to split the family. And if they couldn't come, then we would all stay together.\nBut in 1948, I guess it was opened up. You know, this was after the war. They were\nstill on their Czech -- I mean, Polish passports, but they were able to come at the\ntime.",
        "Q: And do you remember --",
        "A: After, after America saw what Hitler had done, I guess they became a little more\nlenient. I mean, that was a difficult time. I'm sure you've read the story of the Ship of\nFools, you know, where all these -- no one would allow the ships to come in and the\nsent them back to Europe.",
        "Q: Do you remember taking the ship across the ocean?",
        "A: Yes. It was called the SS Degrasse. It was a French ship.And it was -- you know,\nit's sort of like a cruise. It was very, very nice.",
        "Q: And can you spell that for us?",
        "A: SS is just S-S. And de is D-E and grasse is G-R-A-S-S-E.",
        "Q: Thank you. What else do you remember about being on the ship?",
        "A: It was a lot of fun. We, you know, were able to play games and we had lovely\nfood and entertainment. I mean, it was a nice ship. You know, I mean, it wasn't as\nnice, probably as -- you know, the liners today. But after someone who had lived in\nEngland and been through the war, it was lovely.",
        "Q: How long did it take?",
        "A: I think it must have taken well over a week, maybe ten days. I don't know exactly.",
        "Q: And was it calm weather or --",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we didn't have any -- I don't remember any problems with getting ill or\nseasickness or anything like that.",
        "Q: And do you remember your first impression on arriving?",
        "A: Oh, it was very exciting to see the Statue of Liberty. And, yes, it was amazing. It\nwas just amazing. And my uncle and aunt were there waiting for us. And it was in\nManhattan, they lived on 52nd Street and 8th Avenue in a lovely apartment. And they\nhad no children and there --",
        "Q: This was your father's brother, correct?",
        "A: No, my mother's \u2014",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- brother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My father was an only child.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know if I mentioned that.",
        "Q: Yes, you did.",
        "A: No one else. But my mother was one of six children.The oldest was killed in a\nconcentration camp and the youngest was killed with his wife and his baby son. But\nher other sister went through Auschwitz and survived, and the brother also survived\nand they ended up in Israel. And they're the ones who had my cousins. And that's one\nof the reasons she traveled there as often as she did and the reason that we travel\nthere as often as we do.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you remember arriving at the apartment, your, your uncle's apartment?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: It was beautiful. We took an elevator. It was a very nice building. It's still there.I\nmean, they're gone, of course. But, you know, it was very, very nice. And my uncle\nwas a very warm, lovely, wonderful man. His wife was very nice. She was actually\nItalian, Italian Jewish, and he was from Poland. You know, he was sort of the\nrenegade in the family. He ran off in the 20's or something, you know, to come to\nAmerica. And family was very religious, my grandfather in Poland was a Talmudic\nscholar. This was the wife that worked, they had a restaurant, and so it was a\nreligious family. And Uncle Henry --",
        "Q: What was his last name?",
        "A: My uncle?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: grandparents name, it was my mother's maiden name.",
        "Q: And what about your aunt, what was her name?",
        "A: The one here in America?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Her name was Lena. Her maiden name was Ronga. R-O-N-G-A. But, of course,\nafter she was married it was Ehrlich. And, as I said, they were a wonderful couple, no\nchildren. And so they really were very, very good to my brother and to me.",
        "Q: What do you remember about them?",
        "A: Well, Uncle Henry had a variety store. And that's actually what my mother finally\nwent into after my father died. In those days, it was called the Victory Five and Ten.\nAnd the store was on 9th Avenue and 55th Street. And it was sort of like the old\nWoolworth's, not as big, but it sold everything, you know, from toys to pots to dishes\nto cleaning supplies. It's a five and ten, like a variety store. In those days, you know,\nin the 40's and early 50's, that was before all the, you know, Wal-Marts and K-Marts\nand all those discount stores. And they did very well. In fact, Uncle Henry had the\nstore across from the NBC studio on 9th Avenue. And Harry Truman did his series\nthere. And they came to my uncle's store to purchase stuff for -- this was an\ninterview series with Harry S. Truman had he was president. And my uncle went\nover, met Harry Truman, took pictures with Harry Truman, gave pictures to all the\nfamily. And he was like my mom, very outgoing, very gregarious and a very warm\nhuman being.",
        "Q: What were some of the things you did together as a family?",
        "A: Oh, he would take us -- oh, my gosh. The first -- as soon as we came here, I think\nwe drove to -- was it -- where did we drive? Was it Philadelphia or to Washington?\nYou know, he wanted to show us everything. And, you know, he wanted -- he loved\nAmerica. He was a tremendous patriot. And he always said, you know, when he goes\nabroad -- and he was one that had come to visit us in London when we were living\nthere. He said when I come back to America, I kiss the ground. He was a tremendous\npatriot. Tremendous patriot. So he tried to show us all the good things of America\nand took us to the country. In fact, they built or bought a cottage, a nice cottage up in\nthe mountains, where was the mountain? I've forgotten. Not -- no, they called it rump\n-- it was in the Catskills they called Ramat Gan after Israel. And we'd all go up there.\nNot only did we go up there, but he'd invite my husband's sister and my husband's\nparents. And we'd go up there and friends and we would have picnics and barbecues.\nAnd all the cousins got to play together, you know, my children, and my brother's\nchildren, and my sister-in-law's children who all got to know each other up at Ramat\nGan at my Uncle Henry's place.",
        "Q: Can you spell Ramat Gan?",
        "A: Well, I'm sorry?",
        "Q: Can you spell Ramat Gan.",
        "A: Oh, Ramat Gan. Okay. It's a place in Israel, actually, and he named his little\nproperty there after it. It's R-A-M-A-T, and then separate word, Gan, G-A-N. And it\nis a suburb of Tel Aviv, actually, now Ramat Gan. It's a big suburb. It's a diamond\ncenter in Tel Aviv, but he named it after. They were all very strong Israel supporters.",
        "Q: What was life like for your family and how did you -- how did they earn a living?\nDid they help your uncle with the store?",
        "A: No.What happened was that my father -- they decided to open another Victory\nFive and Ten in Astoria where we finally moved. Astoria is in New York. It's in",
        "Q:ueens in the suburb of -- you know, in Q:ueens. Are you familiar \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You're familiar with New York, of course. And so my mother, and, originally it\nwas supposed to be my father, were going to open another Victory Five and Ten.Of\ncourse, my uncle had all the connections and all the -- you know, probably helped\nwith some of the financing and stuff like that. And then my father died very suddenly\nof a heart attack. As I told you, he went to the synagogue on a Saturday and had an\naliyah and actually died on the bimah.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: This was in 1948, right after we came to America after he had gone through\neverything to bring us here. So I told you -- I didn't tell you -- I mean, this goes back,\nreally, to Czechoslovakia and to England. I was extremely close to my father. He\nwould read me stories and tell me stories. And I had a very, very close relationship to\nmy father. And when he died, I wanted to jump into the grave with him. I was so\ndevastated. I was 15 years old. But, you know, it was, it was just such a terrible\nshock. One of the main reasons was that I had always gone to synagogue with\nhim. And that Saturday I had not gone. Not that it would have made a difference, but\nit was devastating. And, meanwhile, my uncle helped my mother and then my\nbrother, who was only -- in 1948 he was 20 years old. He had gone to university in\nLondon, actually. He had gone to the University of London and had studied business\nand some other things. But then when we came to America, he would have gone to\nuniversity. But after my father died, he helped my mother run and establish the store,\nplus they had Q:uite a bit -- they had other help. And I used to go in and help, also.",
        "Q: This was the second store, correct?",
        "A: The second store. And then after a while, after a while, my brother opened a third\nstore. So it wasn't Q:uite a chain, but there was three stores, and this one was in\nBrooklyn. So there was one in Manhattan, one in Q:ueens, and one in Brooklyn.And\nthey were all the Victory Five and Ten. And they were, again, you know, not terribly\n-- you know, when I say successful, they made a good living. That's how -- you\nknow, they -- definitely what, in today's political scene, would be called, you know,\nthe middle class. So -- and, you know, they were able to enjoy all the things, you\nknow, whether it's the theater or whether it's the -- you know, dinner or traveling. It\nwas not easy. My brother really gave up going to school. And I ended up being the\nonly one that went to college. But I would work, also, in the store, as well as other\npeople.",
        "Q: How did your life change after your father died?",
        "A: Well, it was -- we all became a lot closer to each other and realized how important\nfamily 1s, which I do to this day. And my husband and I have made sure that we take\n-- or try to be with our children and grandchildren and go places with them. And\nfamily, you know, became very, very important to us.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: That we realized that, you know, money comes and goes, possessions come and\ngo, but the people that you love and are close to are the things that are the most\nimportant in life.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we've tried, you know, to -- as best as we can, you know, to instill that in our\nfamily. As I said -- well, after -- well, this is a lot later after I got married and we\nsettled out here, we would do trips and national parks, you know, and driving trips\nand a lot of things with family.",
        "Q: What year did you start college?",
        "A: I started college in 1950.",
        "Q: Okay. And how old were you then, 17?",
        "A: Right. Yeah. Because the -- yeah, I \u2014 and then I graduated in 1954.",
        "Q: And how did you decide to go to college?",
        "A: Well, that was another thing that really was -- well, I always loved learning and\ngoing to school. And as I had mentioned before, I had been a good student, even in\nLondon, even though it was sporadic, you know, here and there. But I loved to read\nand I loved -- liked to learn.",
        "Q: Did you finish any high school in New York before you started college?",
        "A: Yes. I finished what is called theBlackboard Jungle, Long Island City High\nSchool. I think that's where they actually filmed that movie, the Blackboard Jungle. It\nwas a tough school. But, again, I tried to tell my grandkids this, you know, it's\nimportant the friends that you make. And people made a lot of fun of me because I\nspoke with an English accent. People often say to me, oh, you grew up in London,\nhow come you don't have an English accent? I said, well, Long Island City High\nSchool took care of that because they would taunt me. And so, you know, I spoke\nAmerican.",
        "Q: And what did you study in college?",
        "A: Business and retailing and business. You know, that was my family's field. You\nknow, my mother had a store, and so I studied at the BaroQ:ue School on 23rd Street\nand Lexington Avenue. It was the College in the Sky, you know, it was not a campus,\nit was a tall building. And that's what I studied there.",
        "Q: Were there options for different fields at the time and business was the path that\nyou were interested in?",
        "A: Yeah. They had -- well, BaroQ:ue was a school that specialized in business. But\nyou could also do, you know, prelaw, accounting. It was primarily -- there was\nalso a city -- as part of City College, and City College had an uptown branch, which,\nyou know, had all the sciences and humanities. I mean, we took those courses, you\nknow, psychology and English and, you know, all the same kind of courses. But the\nprimary, you know, major was retailing and business administration.",
        "Q: And what was college like? Were you still living at home?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. I'd commute from -- I'd take the subway and commute from Astoria,\nwhich was at the end of the line, Ditmars Station, and I'd have to change and\nget down to 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue. But, you know, New York is -- with\nsubways, you can get around. And that's what I did. And we -- you know, it was a\ngood school. I joined a number of organizations. I was part of Boosters, which was\nthe service organization. And, you know, we'd do different functions. I was also part -\n- I couldn't afford sororities, so we had a house plan. And I was in Riner 54. And that\nwas very fortunate, because at one of the house plan parties that we had, I met my\nhusband. So -- and we've been married now for 58 years.",
        "Q: Well, we'll hear more about him in a minute.",
        "A: Okay. I do, I do have a tendency to jump around.",
        "Q: That's okay. What, what classes did you take? Do you remember specifically any\nof them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was --",
        "A: Well, I took statistics, I took business administration. I did take -- I did take\npsychology, I took marketing, I took English.",
        "Q: What were your plans when you finished school?",
        "A: I thought I'd try and get into an executive training program and work for, you\nknow, a large corporation, a company. And I did work for a while at Saks Fifth\nAvenue.",
        "Q: Did you like that?",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: What -- how long were you there for?",
        "A: That was just a part of while I was in school, so it was like, a year. You know, it's\n-- like a trainee or something like that.",
        "Q: Did you do that for the experience or --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- did you need the money\u2019?",
        "A: The work experience, right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Were you paid?",
        "A: Yes. Not very much. Not very much.In fact, my first job out of college, I hate to\neven tell you what I was paid. You'll maybe ask later.",
        "Q: What was your first job after college?",
        "A: My first job out of college was working for a department store called Gertz, which\nwas on the Island. You know, it was easier because I lived there and, you know, I\napplied and I was hired. And, again, they had like, an executive training program.And\nthen I became an assistant buyer in the children's department. And I worked there,\nactually, until we left New York.",
        "Q: What -- what responsibilities did you have as an assistant buyer?",
        "A: Well, I would go into the market and, you know, I would work on the floor, help\ntrain the salespeople. Help with the -- you know, pricing and displays and the things\nthat are involved with retailing, which is also going down to the drain as people buy\neverything on the internet.But, you know, in those days that was that was the way to\nshop. And I really enjoyed it. And I liked working with people, both the people that\nwere the salespeople and the customers. You'd also wait on customers. You know,\nyou were on the floor. So even though you were an assistant buyer and you'd go into\nmarket, as you know, New York has a big clothing market. And it was exciting.",
        "Q: And how long were you there for?",
        "A: Okay. I graduated in 1954. And not very long, because we -- I got married in 1954\nright after I graduated. And I, you know, continued working, because my husband\nwas a student. And then when he finished his training, we moved to California. And\nthat was in 1956, so it was really just a couple of years that I was there.",
        "Q: Okay. And what was your salary there?",
        "A:I think I was getting $55 a week.",
        "Q: How about your salary at Saks Fifth Avenue?",
        "A: Oh, I think that was less. That was less. I don't even remember that. I don't\nremember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In fact, you know, as I think about it, Ican't even remember -- maybe I did not get\na salary. Maybe it was just a training thing. I, I thought -- you know, I don't\nremember exactly about that. But I know that my husband and I lived on that. And it\nwas pretty interesting, because, you know, you had a hamburger, you know -- at that\npoint we didn't take money from anybody, we just managed on what I made. It was a\ndifferent time.",
        "Q: Did you move in together once you got married?",
        "A: Yes. But not before, which is also a different time.",
        "Q: Did you have an apartment?",
        "A: Yeah. We subleased an apartment from someone else and lived in Rego Park,\nwhich is also in Q:ueens.",
        "Q: What was your husband studying?",
        "A: Medicine.",
        "Q: And why did you move to California?",
        "A: Okay. That's -- are you sure you want to ask that Q:uestion? My husband was what\nthey called draft bait. And so when he applied after his internship -- which was very\ntough in those days. And it was a good thing I was working because if not, I don't\nknow if this marriage would have lasted. But it was -- I'm just making that comment.\nBut he was working 36 hours on, 36 hours off, and, you know, just exhausted from\nhis internship. And a very good internship at Mount Sinai, New York. But when he\nfinished the internship and he went looking for residencies, they said, sorry, but, you\nknow -- at that point there was a doctors\u2019 draft \u2014 so we can't take you, you know,\nbecause you may be drafted out of the program. And then he applied to something\ncalled the Barry Plan. And that allowed you to take training and delay, but you signed\nup to go into the service after that. You still committed to going to the service.\nSo then he went back to all the same places. He had very good training. And they\nsaid, oh, we'd love to take you, but everything 1s filled. And it turned out,\nunfortunately, for someone, that someone in California developed, as it was,\ntesticular cancer and had to drop out of the program. And the program had an opening\nin Long Beach and that's how we ended up in Long Beach. We did go back later after\nthe service to New York to finish training. But once you lived in California in those\ndays, it was beautiful. And so -- you know, after everything, we ended up back in\nCalifornia. And it also ended up that we brought our parents, both his parents and my\nmother out here. And they lived here for a good 20 to 25 years.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about that, how it felt leaving your family.",
        "A: I hated leaving my mother and my brother. I really was not a happy camper at all.\nBut I love my husband. And that's where he went, so I went with him. You know,\nRuth, whither thou goest, I will go?",
        "Q: Yes. After -- afterwards you brought your -- both sets of parents with you to\nCalifornia?",
        "A: Right. Right. And they lived in Riverside. And it was a very good time for them.\nJust my mother, of course. My brother visited, my sister-in-law, and we're very, very\nclose. We had a double wedding with Arnie's sister. In fact, that's why I'm having the\ninterview today because this week we're going to my brother-in-law's 80th birthday.\nThey live in Florida. And we've celebrated our major anniversaries together. We had\nall of our families, all of our kids and grandkids altogether for our 50th anniversary.\nVery, very close family.",
        "Q: So your family now is in mainly California and Florida, but not New York?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I have two nephews. My brother's sons still live in New York, but that's it.",
        "Q: What did you do when you arrived in California?",
        "A: Well, I actually worked for a while. Not in retailing, but I worked in a school that\nteaches business. It was a private school. And then I went back to school when my\nkids were in school and I got a master's and then I went back to teaching college. And",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- my husband ended up, you know, practicing here. He's retired, but still teaching\nas a volunteer giving back to the community because he loved what he did. And even\nthough he's over 80, he still goes in and teaches residents.",
        "Q: And is your husband Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, very Jewish.",
        "Q: Where was he born?",
        "A: In the Bronx.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: We're both very committed to Judaism.",
        "Q: And how many children do you have?",
        "A: That's another difficult Q:uestion. I had three children. Unfortunately, I lost a son\nto a heart attack. My kids all went into medicine. He was a doctor but he \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: -- had a heart attack. In other words, a bad, bad family history. I have now two\nchildren, a son and a daughter. They both live in California and they're both\npracticing physicians.",
        "Q: And how many children do they have? I know you said you're a grandmother.\nA Right. Yeah. My daughter and her husband have twins, a boy and a girl. The loves\nof our lives. And my son has four sons, the other four loves of our lives.",
        "Q: And are they both close to you physically? Are they near you in California?",
        "A:Physically, not as close as I would like. But my daughter and her husband live up\nin Santa Cruz, California, so it's an hour's flight. My son lives in the San Fernando\nValley, which is about an hour and 20 minute drive. But we still get together Q:uite a\nbit. In fact, we were just with my son and daughter-in-law down in San Diego with\nthe children this past weekend. That's why we haven't been around, you know, I had\nto give you this date. And then the next day we were with my son, daughter-in-law,\nand one of their children, because three of their kids are now in college.",
        "Q: Okay. Why did you return to school to get your master's and what was it in?\nA My master's was in -- also in business administration and marketing. I went back\nbecause I thought I would like to teach. I liked working. I did a lot of volunteer work\nwith students on different projects when my kids were in school. I was pretty\ninvolved, and I decided that I would like to teach. So in order to teach, you know,\nbusiness in a college, you needed, you know, a further degree, which 1s what I did. I\ntook it at Cal State San Bernardino.",
        "Q: And did you start teaching after you graduated?",
        "A: Yes. I never taught on a full-time basis, I really only taught part time.I taught at a\ncommunity college, and, really, it was a very good experience. And some of my\nstudents have done very well. And then after that, I taught at, again, state university,\nactually, where I got my master's. Because I knew the people there and so then they\nhired me there, too, and I taught.",
        "Q: How many years did you teach for altogether?",
        "A:How many years did I teach? Probably 15. I stopped teaching when my mother\nbecame Q:uite ill and I decided I wanted to take -- help her.",
        "Q: Okay. Is your mother still in California or?",
        "A: No, my mother died. She died in 1993.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A:No, she would be -- she was born in 1904, so she --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. But she did live to be 89 and worked in our synagogue, ran the gift shop,\nwas very popular, was very involved in the community and was very happy here, as\nwere my in-laws. Very involved.",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else you can tell me about California that we haven't\ntouched upon or that you would like to add?",
        "A: Well, we live in a very -- you know, it's a nice community. It has its problems,\nsmog and probably a lot of other things because we're ringed by mountains. But a\nvery close community, especially through the synagogue, which is where we have a\nlot of our friends. And I'm involved in something called Osher and something called\nLIFE, which is Learning is Forever, which is through the University of California in\nRiverside which is for seniors. And we have lectures and programs and different\nthings. So, you know, it's very nice being in a university town. As I told you, I enjoy\nlearning. And so, I think -- as I used to tell my students, learning is not for making a\nliving, it is for living and you should learn as long as you can. And so I enjoy that.\nalso volunteer with an organization called HiCap, which is health insurance\ncounseling. Because I helped my mother when she was ill. And seniors -- because I'm\na senior, too -- but a lot of seniors have a tough time navigating the healthcare\nsystem, and probably is going to get worse, you know. So that's something that I\nvolunteer with. And then I do stuff through the synagogue, you know, on education.\nAnd my husband, as I told you is still teaching. And we -- and whenever we have an\nopportunity to be with our kids and grandkids, we do that. When my daughter was\nworking and her husband was working, she sent her twins down for a summer and\nthey spent the summer here. And I'd take them, you know, for swimming lessons. But\nthat was a number of years ago. They now just started high school. And we just\nfigured we had better enjoy, enjoy the family when they still have time for us.\nBecause, as I'm sure you know, Heather -- I don't know, you're an intern. Are you in\nschool or out of school?",
        "Q: Actually, no, I'm a permanent staff member.\nA Oh, okay. Okay. So -- but, you know, as you get more involved, whether it's with\neducation or with jobs, you know, you don't have as much time for grandparents and\nfamilies. So whenever we have a chance -- we're actually heading to Israel in October\nfor the 100th anniversary for Hadassah.All of us are -- my mother and my daughter\nand my daughter-in-law, my granddaughter and I are all life members. And right after\nthat, it turns out that it's grandparents day at my twins' high school and they just\nstarted high school. And so we're going right from Israel up to Santa Cruz so we can\nbe there for that. And we're also going up for Sukkot -- unfortunately, it's not as easy\nto get together for holidays. All our children belong to synagogues, which makes me\nvery happy that they're involved. And what will happen with the next generation, I\ndon't know. But we took everyone to Israel a couple of years ago. Actually, it was\nfive years ago in 2007. There were 14 of us that went. So we feel it's very important,\nyou know, for our family to know, know Israel and to know the history of the Jews\nand to be proud of who they are.",
        "Q: Have you also been back to Czechoslovakia?",
        "A:Yes.",
        "Q: Or Czech Republic?",
        "A:Yes, we have. We've been back there a couple of times. Not gone back to\nMoravska Ostrave because I probably would not even remember where to go. And\nalso I've heard that the city is not a terrific place to visit now. But I -- I don't know,\nwe may still try to go back, but I don't think so. But we've been to Prague and we've\nbeen to other parts. And Prague is a beautiful, beautiful city. And, of course, you may\nknow that Hitler had maintained a lot of the places there, supposedly as a museum to\nan extinct people. So the Altneuschul, which is the oldest synagogue, and we went\nthere for services -- is been in -- it has been in practice since 1200. Of course not\nduring the Holocaust, but it's still there.A wonderful museum. Have you ever been to\nPrague?",
        "Q: I have not, no.",
        "A: Well, it's an absolutely, beautiful, beautiful city. And a lot of Americans have\ngone there to work, young people, too. So we have -- I have -- both my husband and\nI have been back.",
        "Q: I know you said you've also been back to London a lot, does that include\nKennington?",
        "A:Yes, we did go back to Kennington and it really has changed. I did find the house\nthat we lived in and -- but it's become much more metropolitan. You know, more of a\nlittle town or city compared to the country village that I remember. It was really a\nreal village. You know, the people next door to us, you know, had sheep and chickens\nand Marge, their daughter, was my best friend. And, you know, we used to play\ntogether all the time. So I'm sorry that I lost contact with her. One thing I try to do, I\nstill have that -- you know, several friends that I went to school with at the convent\nthat have visited me here and that I visited in London. So we -- you know, we've\nkept -- we're still in touch.",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to touch on about anything that we've\ncovered that you think is really important that you want to add that I haven't asked\nyou about?",
        "A: No.I think, not only have you asked me things, that I probably, you know, said\nmore about things than you wanted to know. Actually, there was one little thing that I\ndid mention to Ashley before, and that is a story of another cousin of my mother's\nwho left Vienna and tried to go to Switzerland after Germany had already invaded.\nAnd when she got to the border with Switzerland, she needed to go to the bathroom\nher name was Celia Summerville -- well, no, it was Celia Mohrer. She later married\nand her name became Celia Summerville and she was an artist.",
        "Q: Can you spell her name for us?",
        "A: Celia, C-E-L-I-A, and Mohrer was what she was at the time that she left Vienna.\nShe was a very young woman. M-O-H-R-E-R. And her parents were actually in\nLondon. And my mother helped -- they were older and my mother helped take care of\nthem because they were like an aunt and uncle of hers. But when Celia left Vienna at\nthe border, she needed to go to the bathroom and she got off the train. And the Nazis\ngot on the train and cleared off all the Jews. And then she got back on the train and\nwent into Switzerland. And from there she came to live with us for a while in\nLondon, then she moved into her own place. But she then moved to America and\nmarried a Summerville and they lived right near Harvard on Cambridge Street in\nCambridge, Massachusetts. And they had only one son, and he's -- he's a Ph.D in\nepidemiology. And she -- he was working in New Mexico, she moved there, we went\nto visit her, and then, you know, she passed away and he moved up to Alaska. And\nthis summer, he called me and said he was getting married, and could we come up to\nthis little town of Palmer outside of Alaska so we went up there. So just wanted to\nmention that to show you how family is so important, that my husband and I dropped\neverything that we had planned and decided to go back up there and we did. And we\nwent to the wedding and it was -- he was thrilled and his new wife was thrilled.And\nwe're very happy for him because now he has a whole family rather than being all\nalone. And one other thing I do want to mention, you know, I told you about our\nreally tremendous loss. It was with me all the time, my oldest son. His son just got\nout of the IDF in Israel. He was in the Israeli army. And that's another reason we're\ngoing to Israel in October. Not only for the Hadassah's 100th anniversary, but also to\nsee him and the rest of the family. So that's something you didn't ask about maybe\nyou wanted to know, but --",
        "Q: No, we like details.",
        "A:But I just thought, you know, this -- the story of -- she was called Cilly, Celia.It\nsounds -- C-I-L-L-Y. And she was wonderful young lady and I got to know her very\nwell in London. We have some of her paintings, which were exhibited at the Fogg\nMuseum in Harvard. And, so, you know, it's just important to stay close to family. I\nhope you have a good family and --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A:-- realize how important they are.",
        "Q: So she was in the bathroom when the Nazis cleared the train?",
        "A:Yes.",
        "Q: Did she realize what was going on and --",
        "A: No.She got back on the train and didn't realize until she realized that all the people\nthat were traveling with her or near her were gone. You know, and then from\nSwitzerland she came to England and she stayed with us for a little while. And then\nshe, you know, moved into her own apartment, and, you know, did different things,\nbut --",
        "Q: Did she know what happened to the Jews that were taken off the train?",
        "A:No. No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A:No. I don't think there'd be any way, you know, of knowing. But -- and I can't even\nreally tell you what exactly what year it was, because we were already in London\nwhen she came. And she came through Switzerland. But, you know, this was another\none of these stories, sort of like the one about the ship we were supposed to be on\nthat -- you know, it's just by chance that we're here. And that's why it's so important\nto do the best that you can with your life as long as you can. Which sometimes isn't\nas long as you want, but, you try.",

        "A: He was older. He was, you know, Q:uite -- well, several years older, and not that\nmuch. Because he lived in Krakow, he visited us and we visited there. But it, you\nknow -- a visit would be a short visit. But I've been very close to him. We've been to\nIsrael now 26 or 27 times. And so, you know, we've been in touch. And they've been\nhere.",

        "Q: What was the environment like down there?",
        "Q: Did you bring food with you?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we'd bring some food with us. Yeah, maybe sandwiches or something,\nwhatever. Whatever you had because there wasn't that much available. Talking about\nfood, another thing I will remember always is my father buying me a peach for two\nand six pence, which was a lot of money. That was a Q:uarter of a pound. And it was\n-- you know, it was something I just remember, because fruit -- you know, it was\nhard to get fruit.",

        "Q: Do you remember how that you received permission to travel?",
        "A: No. But I know that they got all the papers that we needed. And I guess because of\nmy uncle and my father's, you know, business connections, we were able to come.\nBut not until after the -- you know, this was three years after the war ended. I think\nthey actually wanted to come to America earlier, but as I had mentioned to you, they\ncouldn't come -- oh, I didn't mention this. But they were Polish, both of them were\nPolish, and the Polish Q:uota -- there was a Q:uota system here -- and the Q:uota was\nclosed and they couldn't come in. My brother and I were Czech and the Czech Q:uota\nwas not closed. And that's why we were able to get all the documents that we needed\nto come here on that children's transport, which was sunk. So originally they were\ngoing to send us and then they decided -- my father particularly decided he wasn't\ngoing to split the family. And if they couldn't come, then we would all stay together.\nBut in 1948, I guess it was opened up. You know, this was after the war. They were\nstill on their Czech -- I mean, Polish passports, but they were able to come at the\ntime.",

        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: This was in 1948, right after we came to America after he had gone through\neverything to bring us here. So I told you -- I didn't tell you -- I mean, this goes back,\nreally, to Czechoslovakia and to England. I was extremely close to my father. He\nwould read me stories and tell me stories. And I had a very, very close relationship to\nmy father. And when he died, I wanted to jump into the grave with him. I was so\ndevastated. I was 15 years old. But, you know, it was, it was just such a terrible\nshock. One of the main reasons was that I had always gone to synagogue with\nhim. And that Saturday I had not gone. Not that it would have made a difference, but\nit was devastating. And, meanwhile, my uncle helped my mother and then my\nbrother, who was only -- in 1948 he was 20 years old. He had gone to university in\nLondon, actually. He had gone to the University of London and had studied business\nand some other things. But then when we came to America, he would have gone to\nuniversity. But after my father died, he helped my mother run and establish the store,\nplus they had Q:uite a bit -- they had other help. And I used to go in and help, also.",
        "Q: This was the second store, correct?",
        "A: The second store. And then after a while, after a while, my brother opened a third\nstore. So it wasn't Q:uite a chain, but there was three stores, and this one was in\nBrooklyn. So there was one in Manhattan, one in Q:ueens, and one in Brooklyn.And\nthey were all the Victory Five and Ten. And they were, again, you know, not terribly\n-- you know, when I say successful, they made a good living. That's how -- you\nknow, they -- definitely what, in today's political scene, would be called, you know,\nthe middle class. So -- and, you know, they were able to enjoy all the things, you\nknow, whether it's the theater or whether it's the -- you know, dinner or traveling. It\nwas not easy.

        "Q: And what did you study in college?",
        "A: Business and retailing and business. You know, that was my family's field. You\nknow, my mother had a store, and so I studied at the BaroQ:ue School on 23rd Street\nand Lexington Avenue. It was the College in the Sky, you know, it was not a campus,\nit was a tall building. And that's what I studied there.",
        "Q: Were there options for different fields at the time and business was the path that\nyou were interested in?",
        "A: Yeah. They had -- well, BaroQ:ue was a school that specialized in business. But\nyou could also do, you know, prelaw, accounting. It was primarily -- there was\nalso a city -- as part of City College, and City College had an uptown branch, which,\nyou know, had all the sciences and humanities.

        "Q: And how long were you there for?",
        "Q: Okay. And what was your salary there?",
        "Q: How about your salary at Saks Fifth Avenue?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did you move in together once you got married?",
        "Q: Did you have an apartment?",
        "A: Yeah. We subleased an apartment from someone else and lived in Rego Park,\nwhich is also in Q:ueens.",
        "Q: What was your husband studying?",
        "Q: And why did you move to California?",
        "A: Okay. That's -- are you sure you want to ask that Q:uestion? My husband was what\nthey called draft bait. And so when he applied after his internship -- which was very\ntough in those days. And it was a good thing I was working because if not, I don't\nknow if this marriage would have lasted. But it was -- I'm just making that comment.\nBut he was working 36 hours on, 36 hours off, and, you know, just exhausted from",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about that, how it felt leaving your family.",
        "Q: Yes. After -- afterwards you brought your -- both sets of parents with you to\nCalifornia?",
        "Q: So your family now is in mainly California and Florida, but not New York?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: What did you do when you arrived in California?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And is your husband Jewish?",
        "Q: Where was he born?",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "Q: And how many children do you have?",
        "A: That's another difficult Q:uestion. I had three children. Unfortunately, I lost a son\nto a heart attack. My kids all went into medicine. He was a doctor but he \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: And how many children do they have? I know you said you're a grandmother.\nA Right. Yeah. My daughter and her husband have twins, a boy and a girl. The loves\nof our lives. And my son has four sons, the other four loves of our lives.",
        "Q: And are they both close to you physically? Are they near you in California?",
        "A:Physically, not as close as I would like. But my daughter and her husband live up\nin Santa Cruz, California, so it's an hour's flight. My son lives in the San Fernando\nValley, which is about an hour and 20 minute drive. But we still get together Q:uite a\nbit. In fact, we were just with my son and daughter-in-law down in San Diego with\nthe children this past weekend. That's why we haven't been around, you know, I had\nto give you this date. And then the next day we were with my son, daughter-in-law,\nand one of their children, because three of their kids are now in college.",
        "Q: Okay. Why did you return to school to get your master's and what was it in?\nA My master's was in -- also in business administration and marketing. I went back\nbecause I thought I would like to teach. I liked working. I did a lot of volunteer work\nwith students on different projects when my kids were in school. I was pretty\ninvolved, and I decided that I would like to teach. So in order to teach, you know,\nbusiness in a college, you needed, you know, a further degree, which 1s what I did. I\ntook it at Cal State San Bernardino.",
        "Q: And did you start teaching after you graduated?",
        "Q: How many years did you teach for altogether?",
        "A:How many years did I teach? Probably 15. I stopped teaching when my mother\nbecame Q:uite ill and I decided I wanted to take -- help her.",
        "Q: Okay. Is your mother still in California or?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else you can tell me about California that we haven't\ntouched upon or that you would like to add?",
        "Q: Actually, no, I'm a permanent staff member.\nA Oh, okay. Okay. So -- but, you know, as you get more involved, whether it's with\neducation or with jobs, you know, you don't have as much time for grandparents and\nfamilies. So whenever we have a chance -- we're actually heading to Israel in October\nfor the 100th anniversary for Hadassah.All of us are -- my mother and my daughter\nand my daughter-in-law, my granddaughter and I are all life members. And right after\nthat, it turns out that it's grandparents day at my twins' high school and they just\nstarted high school. And so we're going right from Israel up to Santa Cruz so we can\nbe there for that. And we're also going up for Sukkot -- unfortunately, it's not as easy\nto get together for holidays. All our children belong to synagogues, which makes me\nvery happy that they're involved. And what will happen with the next generation, I\ndon't know. But we took everyone to Israel a couple of years ago. Actually, it was\nfive years ago in 2007. There were 14 of us that went. So we feel it's very important,\nyou know, for our family to know, know Israel and to know the history of the Jews\nand to be proud of who they are.",
        "Q: Have you also been back to Czechoslovakia?",
        "Q: Or Czech Republic?",
        "Q: I have not, no.",
        "Q: I know you said you've also been back to London a lot, does that include\nKennington?",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to touch on about anything that we've\ncovered that you think is really important that you want to add that I haven't asked\nyou about?",
        "Q: Can you spell her name for us?",
        "Q: No, we like details.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: So she was in the bathroom when the Nazis cleared the train?",
        "Q: Did she realize what was going on and --",
        "Q: Did she know what happened to the Jews that were taken off the train?",

At one time it was Gunsburg, G-U, with an umlaut, and B-U-R-\nG. But we've gone by Ginsberg now for the last 60 years, I'm sure.",
        "A:Yes. I was born April the 10th, 1933, in the town of Moravska Ostrave in\nCzechoslovakia, sometimes known as Maehrisch-Ostrau because German was spoken\nthere, also. It was actually part of Moravia.",
        "A: Yes, it's M-O-R-A-V-S-K-A.Another word, Ostrave, O-S-T-R-A-V-E. And\nCzechoslovakia, which no longer exists, but is now the Czech Republic.",
        "A: Yes. My father was Gerson, G-E-R-S-O-N, Ginsberg. And my mother was Blanche\nBasia, B-A-S-I-A. That was a Polish name. Ginsberg, maiden name of\nE-H-R-L-I-C-H.",
        "A:My father was born, actually, July 7th, 1897. And he was born in a city called\nSzinov, S-Z-I-N-O-V, Czechoslovakia. And my mother was born in Krakow, Poland,\non the 13th of March in 1904.",
        "A: It was the \u2014",
        "A: Well, Czechoslovakia, it was Czech, but also sometimes German.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: Yes. I had a wonderful brother by the name of Oskar, O-S-K-A-R, and,\nunfortunately, lost him at a very young age of a heart attack. But he did survive and\ngo to England and then America with us.",
        "A: He was born November 16th, 1928.",
        "A: He was a fantastic, wonderful, giving young man. We were very close. As\nyoungsters, of course, he used to tease me. But we had a very, very wonderful\nrelationship where he lived -- after we came to the United States and after I was\nmarried and moved out to California, we would travel back and forth, send\nchildren back and forth, our children to visit. He took my sons up to Yosemite when\nhe came out for a Bar Mitzvah. We celebrated weddings, of course, and Bar Mitzvahs\nof our nephews. And they came out to celebrate things out here in California with us.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But he preceded us \u2014",
        "A: -- by a little while.",
        "A: Well, interestingly enough, I find it hard to believe, but I remember the Germans\nmarching in. We lived in a very lovely apartment in Czechoslovakia -- in Moravska\nOstrave. And I was only six -- not even six years old, but I do remember the Germans\nmarching in in the Mercedes Benz. And to this day, we have never ever considered\ngetting a Mercedes Benz, which, I guess, doesn't make a lot of sense. But it was a --\nsomething that I remember seeing the Germans, you know, with the Heil Hitler with\nthe arms out and the soldiers. And certainly not understanding what was going on,\nbut knowing something was really wrong.",
        "A: Six.",
        "A: We lived in an apartment. Czechoslovakia, as opposed to Poland, was really",
        "A: We had -- yes. Yes, we had people -- yes. In fact, even someone who cooked and -\n- yes, we did.",
        "A: We lived pretty comfortable in those days.",
        "A: Well, not really that much. I mean, I remember that I went to a school, like a\nkindergarten. And we used to go to the park and things were very nice. It was pretty\nmuch an industrial city. Right now, I think it's -- I haven't been back there. We've\nbeen back to Prague several times with my husband. But I've not gone back to\nMoravska Ostrave. And I've heard, you know, that there's a lot of pollution because\nthere are factories and coal burning things. So we haven't -- I haven't gone back there.\nBut, as I said, we have been to Czechoslovakia, to Prague, and to cal -- (?Calurvi?)\n-- it was called Bard, (ph) but it had a different name in Czech.",
        "A: Saleveece barry (ph) I think.",
        "A: In Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Really --",
        "A: Not much because he was older and he was in school, and I, you know, played\nwith children. And just like here, you know, if you're in kindergarten, your activities\nare a little different than if you're four years older. But we did visit our grandparents\nand we had visitors from, as I mentioned before, my cousins Zvi Barlev, whose book\nby the way, is in the Holocaust Museum. I donated it. It's in several different\nmuseums. He did write about his experience, so --",
        "A: Yes, it's called \"Would God it Were Night.\" His name is Zvi Barlev.",
        "A: Z-V-I, and the second name B-A-R-L-E-V. However, that's his Israeli name. His\nPolish name was Bleicher. B-L-E-I-C-H-E-R. And --",
        "A: And the book actually talks about the ordeal of a Jewish boy from Krakow\nthrough Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Gusen, Gusen. And it talks about the death\nmarch after Auschwitz, you know, before it was liberated, and his walking through\nthe town that he visited when he was a boy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I am avery active member of synagogue here in Riverside, yes.",
        "A: Oh, wait a minute. Are you talking about Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: That I don't remember.",
        "A: We -- Iremember London very well, the synagogue, because I used to go with my\nfather all the time. But in Czechoslovakia, no, I don't remember. But we definitely\nwere members. In those days, as I said, my family, my father in particular, was\nOrthodox, my mother not as much.",
        "A: I don't. I don't.",
        "A: No.As opposed to things that were going on in places like Poland and Lithuania,\nno. Czechoslovakia was -- no. It was only formed between the World Wars, and it had\nreally progressive governments and it allowed the Jews, you know, to own property.\nAnd my father, as I mentioned -- I mean, at the age, I think, of 24 bought an\napartment house. Actually, the apartment house was in Berlin. You know, so, of\ncourse, those were times when there was, you know, major problems economically in\nGermany. So -- but he was a very -- well, he was a wonderful man, but he was a very\nastute businessman.",
        "A: I think it was in March of 1939. It may have been a little bit earlier, but I think it\nwas in 1939. Actually, Czechoslovakia was given -- land was given to the Germans\nin 1938, but I don't think they marched into Moravska Ostrave until 1939.",
        "A: Well, I find it difficult to believe this myself, but I was in the street, maybe with a\nnanny or something or with the maid. You know, somebody, not my mother. And I\nremember the cars and I remember the Germans coming in.And then a very\ninteresting thing is that a German came over to me and there was like, a candy store\nright there. And I was a cute little child, and he said to me in German -- I spoke\nGerman at the time -- that I have a little girl like you at home, and actually took me\ninto the candy store and bought me a piece of candy.I mean, that's the kind of thing --\nyou know, it seems really a weird thing to remember, but that --",
        "A: No.No. And, obviously, he wasn't in one of the cars, though, he was probably\nmarching. Because it was a whole, you know, like, a march into town. And it was a\nbig city, I mean, it was a cosmopolitan city. I don't know how many people, but, you\nknow, it had cinemas. It was a very contemporary city.",
        "A: No.He just went on his way and I probably was taken upstairs.",
        "A: Yes, the candy store was very close. And maybe that's what we were doing\ndownstairs. It's hard, I was six.",
        "A: No, I don't. Because after that, I don't -- things didn't change that much at that\npoint. I mean, I think I still, you know, went to the kindergarten and -- at that point.\nYou know, later on, of course, it was totally changed and the children were sent to\nRavensbruck. Most of them, you know, was murdered. But in the very beginning, it\nhadn't hit yet.",
        "A: Okay. Now, it's very difficult for me to give you an actual date, but let me tell you\nhow we left for Krakow. The Germans -- my mother wanted to take us to England\nwhere my father was. And there was no way she could get permission, but somehow\nshe was able to talk -- now, you know, this was something that I found out a lot later\n-- to someone in the German, well, authority -- and she was a charmer. She was an\nabsolute charmer. And she was able to talk them into her taking her two children to\nvisit her father who was dying in Krakow. That was my grandfather. He was actually\ndying, he did have stomach cancer. And so we just put on clothes, you know, a\ncouple layers of clothes and went on the train and went to Krakow. The amazing\nthing is, that she was able to ship things to London. You know, which is an unusual\nstory, because, you know, usually you just leave everything and that's the end of it.\nBut to this day, I have menorahs.My daughter now has beautiful candlesticks, and,\nyou know, many things. And I was asked if I would donate stuff to the museum, and,\nactually, I want to keep it for my children, and grandchildren --",
        "A: -- to have.But she -- she was able to ship things.",
        "A: Yes -- no, to London, to my father.",
        "A: And -- but then when we left, we left with nothing and went on the train and went\nto Krakow. And she stayed with my grandfather and I was taken care of by, you\nknow, my cousins and aunts and my brother, too. And my grandfather died. And he\ndied, actually, I guess it was beginning of August of 1939. And she sat Shiva.\nI don't know if you know what that is, Shiva is the seven days that you sit after\nsomeone dies.",
        "A: And then she tried to talk her sisters and brothers to let her take their children to\nLondon. And everybody said, no, you know, he's got Czechoslovakia and that's going\nto be it. You know, he's -- you know, that's -- and they -- nobody left except for my\nmother, my brother, and I. And we went across Poland and went to a port called\nGdynia at the time because it was part of Poland --",
        "A: G-D -- gu din (ph) -- N-I-A I think. Gud (ph) -- oh, Y. Let me just write it out.\nThe thing 1s that that port changed many times. That port was called Gdansk and also\nDanzig when it was part of Germany. Danzig. And Gdynia would be G-D-N-Y -- gu\ndin (ph) -- A I think.",
        "A: I'm not sure. And Gdansk is probably easier to spell. It's G -- gurs (ph) -- D --\ndunk. G-D-E-N-A-S-K I think.",
        "A: But it's been -- you probably can look it up. Danzig the different names that it's\ngone under. You know, these things went back between Germany and Poland. So we\ntook a ship and went across the English Channel --",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "A:Poland?",
        "A: She -- I don't think she -- I don't know.",
        "A: I don't think -- you know, it was still -- you know, she had a passport, I think, and\nyou were able to travel in Europe. I mean, this was before the Germans invaded and -\n- I mean, my father had gone to England from Czechoslovakia. They traveled all\nover, all over Europe.",
        "A: And so, you know, they had passports or whatever they needed to travel.",
        "A: He went on business, you know, to -- no, my father went on business. But my\nfather was a worrier, and that will explain what happened to him later. And he, I think,\nforesaw that things were going to happen, and so he went to, to England on business.",
        "A: Right. Right. Oh, absolutely. I mean, we wouldn't have gone otherwise. He -- he\nhad gone. And I can't tell you how long he was there, but I can tell you that when he -\n- we came there, he was only 39.He was in the hospital with a heart attack. So the\npressures and the strains, you know, of the family -- and between my father and my\nmother, they were able to get us over there.",
        "A: No.That's such an interesting thing because the British -- actually, there were\nmany refugees that came to England. Most countries, including America, including,\nyou know, so many countries, even in South America and Australia, you know,\nnobody really wanted the Jews to come. But my father was there on business, and it's\nnot just -- we then made friends with a lot of other people. In fact, I'm still a close\nfriend of somebody who came from Moravska Ostrave that were close friends of my\nparents. The name was Winer, (ph) and she's now married. Her name is Honey\nArnold. She's still alive and she's in England. And we're still in touch and close. We\nvisit there and they visited here. And they came to London. And there were probably\noh -- not dozens -- there were many, many people that came to England.\nAnd that is amazing. I don't know, because I know the British have not always been\nwonderful, they were very difficult. We were in London at the time of Israel being\nestablished, and certainly the British were pretty bad about letting Jews into Israel.So\nwe were just very lucky. We did have an -- my mother had an aunt there, her sis --\nher mother's sister lived in England for many years. And so we actually lived with\nher for a little while until we got established in England. But that was not an easy\ntime either, because it was wartime and the Blitz and everything else. But, you know,\nthese are things that, as I got older, you know, I remembered more things about what\nhappened and our evacuation and the bombings and going into the underground\nshelters. And so it was a difficult time, but as children, you sort of adapt to what it 1s.",
        "A: Yes. Well, actually, in Szinov. My two grandparents, my father's -- my father was\nan only child, and the only family we had were his parents. And we used to visit --\noh, that was something I forgot to mention. As a child, we used to go out to Szinov\nand they had a big garden with fruit. And we used to go and pick berries. So we had a\n-- really had a very nice childhood in the beginning. Well, it was pretty short. But\nthey stayed there and, unfortunately -- well, maybe fortunately for him, my\ngrandfather also passed away. But my grandmother, Ella, her name was Ella Brenner,\nhis name was David Ginsberg, she did not survive and was killed by the Nazis.",
        "A: Yes. But, actually, not from Czechoslovakia. Because of my mother's big -- my\nmother had a very big family as opposed to my father. She actually went to Krakow,\nand from there she was deported. And I don't know exactly where or when, but she\nwas killed, as was my mother's mother. They were both killed by the Nazis, as were a\ncouple of my mother's siblings and some children, so...",
        "A: Well, that would be great.",
        "A: Her name was Ella Brenner -- well, Ginsberg.",
        "A: And my other grandmother was Erlich, Eva Erlich, maiden name of Corow. (ph)\nhave a -- he put together a family tree. Not so much of my father's side like Ella\nGinsberg, but of the Ehrlich side, which was my mother's maiden name.",
        "A: Because he -- as I said, you probably can find the book at, you know, at the\nmuseum. So that -- but there are a lot of books that have been written, but, of course,\nthis one was published -- I guess it was a self-publish thing by Vantage. And it did\nhave a forward, actually, I think, by Elie Weisel even.",
        "A: It was translated from the Hebrew, not only into English, but into Swedish and\nNorwegian. And so the book was in a few different places.",
        "A: No, we went to live with my great aunt. It was my grandmother's sister. We lived\nwith her. She had a house at Six and Andrews Grove in Stamford Hills. And we lived\nwith her because my father was in the hospital, as I said, with a heart attack. But once\nhe recovered, then we moved into an apartment at Two Stamford Hill Mansion.And\nthat's where we lived until -- I mean, we lived there the whole time, but I was -- we\nwere evacuated part of the time.",
        "A: A village, which is now a bigger town, called Kennington, outside of Oxford.",
        "A: Kennington --",
        "A: And my mother.",
        "A: And my father used to come on the weekends. He would be working in the city.\nHe was still working, he had his business. But terrible, terrible strains. Terrible\nstrains, you know, trying to keep the family as safe as possible. In fact -- and I\nmentioned this to Ashley, but I will tell you, I guess, it was in 1940 things looked so\nbad in England. And we thought that -- the Germans had invaded everywhere -- that\nit looked like they might be coming into England, too. So my father, being the\nwotrrier that he was, said we're going -- we had an uncle in America. He said we're\ngoing to send the children to America. And we stood in line and applied for all the\npapers that you need for that and got everything and were scheduled to take a ship\nand go to -- actually, I think it was Canada, but then America. It left from Liverpool.\nAnd that ship was sunk, and, I think, 70 some odd children died on that and other\npeople. But at the last minute, my father decided we're stick -- keep the family\ntogether. So even though we had all the papers to go, we didn't go.",
        "A: Actually, I think it would have just been the children, just my brother and I. You\nknow, like -- it was like the Kindertransport, but it was a little different. You know,\nit was something that they were trying to arrange to get kids out of England when it\nlooked very dangerous.",
        "A: And I don't know about my mother at that point, but I do know that we had all the\npapers we needed. And then the discussion with the family and my father said, no,\nwe're going to stay together.",
        "A: Right. He said, you know, I -- that the family needs to stay together, but we'll try\nand stay safe. And we did in those days of the Blitz. It's an amazing thing, Heather,\nbut the kids used to like to go down into the Underground because they'd run around\nwith all their friends. You know, children are amazing, I mean, how they adapt to\ndifferent things. And we would go into the shelters, you know, when the sirens would\ngo off.And then we'd be with other kids and other friends. And that -- they sort of\nlearn to adapt to the situation. And it was interesting because a lot of schools closed.\nBut there was one school that stayed open, and it happened to be a convent, a\nCatholic school. And, of course, I was Jewish, as were a number of my friends, and\nthe convent allowed us to come. And not only allowed us to come to the school, but\nwe had asked if when they had their catechism and everything else, could we have a\nJewish teacher come in and they allowed us to do it. So for part of the time -- and I\nended up with a very -- even though I was evacuated and in Kennington in a one-\nroom schoolhouse with my brother, who was four years older than I was, and then\ncoming back to London and going to the convent, by the time I came to America --\nwe're getting ahead of ourselves -- but I started high school. And because of the years\nof education I had, they put me in as a freshman. But after I was there for six months,\nI became an upper junior because of all the subjects we'd already had, even during\nthe wartime.",
        "A: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We understood that the Germans were bombing and were hoping to come into\nEngland. And we really felt, maybe because where we came from -- the British may\nnot have felt this way, maybe they felt a little stronger, you know, that no one 1s\ngoing to come in here. But after seeing what had happened in Europe, there were\ntimes that we really thought that the Germans would come in and invade Britain or\nLondon.",
        "A: I understood that Hitler wanted to rule the world and get rid of the Jews, one of\nthe things that he wanted, one of the main things that he wanted. And the amazing\nthing is that somewhere or other they said that somewhere in his background there\nwas some Jewish blood. And, you know, sometimes those -- you can get Jews\nsometimes that are so self -- not that he was Jewish, I'm not trying to say that. But\nthey can be self-hating and worse than anyone else against the Jews. We did\nunderstand that, as Jews, we were very vulnerable.",
        "A: Well, I know there was anti-Semitism. But when I think about my experience at\nthe convent and the friends that I made and that -- one of the gals that was in my\nclass actually became the mother superior, and I visited her on one of our many visits\nto London. I really had very positive feelings about, you know, how other people\ntreated us.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: But there definitely was anti-Semitism in London. I mean, I've read many things.\nYou know, people resented the Jews coming in and taking jobs away and things like\nthat. So I know that it definitely existed. But we happened to live in a very Jewish\narea. It's even more Jewish now than when we lived there, Stamford Hill. And so our\nfriends with Jewish -- now, there was a Catholic school there, but we belonged to a\nsynagogue and attended services and really participated in Jewish life there, again,\ncelebrated the holidays. Friday nights my father would bring home people for dinner\nwithout even talking to my mother. So we'd always have guests at Friday night\ndinners. And things were rationed, but somehow we managed. In fact, I remember my\nparents never eating an egg because they wanted to give -- we got two eggs or\nsomething -- giving the eggs to, you know, to my brother and me. They figured we\nneeded them more than they did. So we had, really, you know -- they were difficult\ntimes. And we certainly didn't have the same kind of life that we had in\nCzechoslovakia. My mother was not working. But, you know, she had to clean the\nhouse and clean the floors. And I'd help her, you know. So it was a different, different\nlife, but still --",
        "A: Yes, my father was working.",
        "A: Yeah, still in the fur business, yes.",
        "A: He had a partner, I remember, Arpud, (ph) and must have done okay because, you\nknow, we had food as much as we could, you know, with rationing. We had a kosher\nhome. We were always --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Interestingly enough, and at least in London. And in Kennington, I have no\nidea because they had never seen a Jew before. And when we came there, they\nactually wanted to know if we had horns. And, again, my mother, ended up charming\nthem. She'd invite them over and she'd bake strudel and stuff. And there we were\nbilleted or lived with an Anglican minister in his house, you know, when we were\nevacuated, my mother, my brother, and I. And when my father came, he would stay\nthere, too, and --",
        "A: No, he was single. His name was Reverend Williamson. And he particularly, I\nmust say, liked me. That might sound difficult today. But as long as we lived in\nEngland, he would never forget my birthday. And he was very kind to us, too. So,\nyou know, it's interesting, you know, with all the anti-Semitism going along, the\npeople that we dealt with were very kind.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I did. We lived next to a girl who became one of my best friends there by\nthe name of Marge Hoggnet. (ph) I've lost touch with her. She eventually moved to\nAmerica. But I -- I tried to locate her. Not Jewish, they were farmers. And they had\nchickens and they actually had sheep. And I actually helped with -- I didn't really\nhelp, but I was there and they let me do some sheering of sheep. And so it was, again,\na different -- very nice people. And they -- a lot of it had to do with the way that my\nmother behaved and, I guess, the way we behaved. And we -- there was only a one-\nroom schoolhouse, you know, where all the kids went to school together. As I said, I\nwent to school with my brother, but -- who was four and a half years older than I\nwas. But we had a schoolhouse.",
        "A: Yes, it was just one room. Oh, yes, just one class. It was just one class.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Well, we were there two different times. One was earlier, you know, when the\nBlitz was really bad. And the second time -- and I don't know the exact dates, you\nprobably can look that up -- when the buzz bombs came over and they decided it was\ntoo dangerous to stay in London. The buzz bombs were the ones that you could hear,\nand then when they stopped they would drop and blow up whatever they landed on.\nAnd that was later, you know, maybe in '43. The first one was maybe around\n'40, '41.",
        "A: It wasn't years. It would be several months. Because we would go to Oxford, and\nnear Oxford there was actually an American Air Force base and we used to see the\nYanks. And there was an expression that the kids there used, got any gum, chum.You\nknow, just -- you know, it was something that we would say if we met an American.\nAnd I did meet a couple of them. But, you know, how old was I, 10, 11, something\nlike that. We were young.",
        "A: We didn't ever go to the base. They were just young, nice guys. You know, this was\n-- actually, let's see, America went into the war in '41, so the first time -- I don't think\nthey were -- the first time we were there, I don't think they were even at war yet. But\nthere were some American soldiers that did come to Europe. And there was a base --\nand I don't know exactly where it was -- but it was somewhere near Oxford.Oxford 1s\na beautiful city, very historic.",
        "A: Well, after it was over, we would go outside and we would try to collect shrapnel.\nNow, none of the buildings where we lived, you know, were hit or blown up. But\nthere was -- you know, there was a lot of damage. And one of the things that we did\nas kids is we would go out, you know, and collect shrapnel.",
        "A: We found some. Found some.",
        "A: Other kids, other children that I was friendly with. Like, even this girl that I\nmentioned to you, but there was -- there were other friends, you know, that we made\nas youngsters, you know, from school, from the neighborhood. Usually it was in the\nneighborhood.",
        "A: In the war?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we did. I don't think we realized how, how horrific it was in Europe,\nyou know, as children. Certainly my parents did. And I know that they did\ncommunicate for a little while. There was a ghetto in Krakow where all the family\nwas, including the grandmother. And they got a picture of her -- that's my mother's\nmother. And -- but as I mentioned to you, my father, you know, the stress and the\nstrain was really tremendous on him. Tremendous. And --",
        "A: In the beginning.",
        "A: In the beginning, yes. But, you know, then things got much worse. And we didn't\nreally talk about these things like -- we always had dinner together. And I think my\nparents tried to have us have as normal a life as you possibly could. One of the things\nthat was rather interesting was that, as a youngster -- and this is when I -- I don't even\nremember at what age -- I developed appendicitis and I didn't want to admit it. And,\nactually, it ended up rupturing. This was the days before penicillin.And my father,\nwho is very religious -- and, as I said, we were as kosher as we could be, you know,\nand we were.You know, we kept separate dishes and -- for whatever food we had.\nAnd when I was in the hospital -- I'll never forget this -- and they didn't have much\nmeat or anything else, and the only thing they had was bacon. And he said I want you\nto eat that because it's more important, you know, to save your life than to worry\nabout kosher.",
        "A: No.Isn't that funny? I don't. But I was little, maybe nine. Eight, nine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, there were different ways that we could be underground. There were\nshelters, which were near the apartment. And people from the apartment would go to\nthe shelter and stay there until there was, you know, there was a siren, and then there\nwas an all clear siren. So you would go to that. But the ones that I remember the most\nis when we went into the Undergrounds, which -- have you ever been to England?",
        "A: A lot of people, and, you know, with blankets and they would sleep down there.\nAnd all -- you know, families would sort of stay together. And it wasn't that often that\nwe'd go into the Underground. But thefew times that I remember, it was not that -- it\nsounds like an awful experience, but it wasn't. I don't know how to describe that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.That was the time that we were actually in the West End and somebody was\nselling fruit and he bought it for me. We still did things, you know, I went with my\nfather.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yeah, I went to school all the time that we were there. And we had --\nyou know, we had to work hard and study hard. And we had good teachers. Some\nwere nuns, some were not nuns. I remember a Sister Ursula who had a very good\nsense of humor.",
        "A: Well, they were strict. You know, on my report cards -- which I think I still have\nsomewhere -- it was -- I was a very good student at the time. I usually -- this gal who\neventually became mother superior and I were always like, first, second in the class.\nAnd on my report card, I'd have all these nice grades. And then on the conduct, it\nwould say very good conduct but she talks too much. So I guess I'm still doing it.",
        "A: No.No. No. This was an all girls' school. He was in another school and he had a lot\nof -- he was very social and he had a lot of friends, too. | And I remember the\nfriends, and, you know, they were handsome young men. And they used to, you\nknow -- used to bother them and they would always sort of try to get rid of -- from all\ntheir activities, I guess. That's the way, you know, it is with brothers that are older.",
        "A: Not that much. Because he -- you know, he was with his friends and I was with\nmy friends. And we did spend time at home. And when we were in Kennington, we\nwere in the same school. And he put up with me.",
        "A: Well, it -- 1945, you know, things slowly, slowly started getting better. And, of\ncourse, this is where -- by that time, I was 12 and --",
        "A: Ended? Yes. Yes. And there were, you know, big celebrations. And -- but then the\nthing that I remember a lot is how I felt as a Jew with the fact that Britain was not\nallowing, you know, Jews to go to Israel. We were -- oh, I was part of a youth group,\nand it was a Zionist youth group. It's called B'nai Akivah.",
        "A: B'nai is capital B, apostrophe N-A-I, Akivah is A-K-I-V-A-H. Named after Rabbi\nAkivah. And we had a lot of activities. I even went -- after the war, I even went to a\ncamp, you know, which was like, in the country with this group, you know, where we\nwould do a lot of, you know, singing and dancing like, a lot -- and other activities.",
        "A: I don't. I don't remember where it was, but it was the country. And there's a lot of\nbeautiful country not far from London. You know, whether it's Somerset or -- a lot of\nvery nice places. And so we were very committed to, I guess, to Zionism. My father\nactually attended the last Zionist Congress, which is the 12th Zionist Congress. That\nwas the last one. I think that was in 1920-something. It was after World War I. And\nmy mother, too. I mean, she was in Israel. She went to Israel in 1948. She was on one\nof the first boats that went to Israel. Actually, she sat at the table with Leonard\nBernstein's parents and remembered the conversation of how disappointed he was\nthat his son didn't go into his business. That's Leonard Bernstein, musician, of\ncourse, I'm sure you know. And 1948, we saw her off to go to Israel for the first time\nright after it was established as a state. And she went many times. And once we were\nable to, my husband and I, as I told you, we've been there many times, too, and have\nremained very close to, not only Zvi, but we had three other first cousins that\nsurvived and ended up in Israel. One has passed away, two are still alive.",
        "A: They were great supporters in any way that they could of Jewish causes,\nsynagogue, of Zionism, of Israel being a Jewish state. And so in that way, I mean,\nthey -- my father went to the Zionist Congress, but I don't remember -- you know,\nthere weren't anymore after that. So I -- you know, and I don't think he was that\ninvolved in organizations. He was more involved in the synagogue. He went to\nsynagogue every Saturday and --",
        "A: No, in London and then in New York. Unfortunately --",
        "A: -- in 1948, he went to the synagogue. He had an aliyah and he had his last heart\nattack and he died. And he was only 52 or three. So he got us through all this stuff\nand brought us to America and he died. A tremendous loss. Then my mother carried\non in the most amazing way with my brother. And I'm the only one that actually was\nable to go to college. I worked, but went to school and graduated. But my brother\nworked with my mother. They opened up a store and were successful again.",
        "A: They did very well financially. I mean, I shouldn't say very well, you know, they -\n- you know, were able to live very good lives. As I said, my mother was able to\ntravel, go to Israel, see her family. But, as I've said a few times, she was probably one\nof the most amazing people I've ever known.",
        "A: No.No. He had a heart attack in 1939 when we came there and he was in the\nhospital. Then he did not have another heart attack. He suffered, though, you know,\nin walking. He had angina. And -- but he worked and he traveled back and forth, you\nknow, to Kennington and did all the things. And helped me when I was in the -- was\nthere for me when I was in the hospital. And then my -- we came to America and my\nmother had a brother here living in New York City. And at first, we lived with him\nfor a very short time.",
        "A: 1948.",
        "A: After, after America saw what Hitler had done, I guess they became a little more\nlenient. I mean, that was a difficult time. I'm sure you've read the story of the Ship of\nFools, you know, where all these -- no one would allow the ships to come in and the\nsent them back to Europe.",
        "A: Yes. It was called the SS Degrasse. It was a French ship.And it was -- you know,\nit's sort of like a cruise. It was very, very nice.",
        "A: SS is just S-S. And de is D-E and grasse is G-R-A-S-S-E.",
        "A: It was a lot of fun. We, you know, were able to play games and we had lovely\nfood and entertainment. I mean, it was a nice ship. You know, I mean, it wasn't as\nnice, probably as -- you know, the liners today. But after someone who had lived in\nEngland and been through the war, it was lovely.",
        "A: I think it must have taken well over a week, maybe ten days. I don't know exactly.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, we didn't have any -- I don't remember any problems with getting ill or\nseasickness or anything like that.",
        "A: Oh, it was very exciting to see the Statue of Liberty. And, yes, it was amazing. It\nwas just amazing. And my uncle and aunt were there waiting for us. And it was in\nManhattan, they lived on 52nd Street and 8th Avenue in a lovely apartment. And they\nhad no children and there --",
        "A: No, my mother's \u2014",
        "A: -- brother.",
        "A: My father was an only child.",
        "A: I don't know if I mentioned that.",
        "A: No one else. But my mother was one of six children.The oldest was killed in a\nconcentration camp and the youngest was killed with his wife and his baby son. But\nher other sister went through Auschwitz and survived, and the brother also survived\nand they ended up in Israel. And they're the ones who had my cousins. And that's one\nof the reasons she traveled there as often as she did and the reason that we travel\nthere as often as we do.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was beautiful. We took an elevator. It was a very nice building. It's still there.I\nmean, they're gone, of course. But, you know, it was very, very nice. And my uncle\nwas a very warm, lovely, wonderful man. His wife was very nice. She was actually\nItalian, Italian Jewish, and he was from Poland. You know, he was sort of the\nrenegade in the family. He ran off in the 20's or something, you know, to come to\nAmerica. And family was very religious, my grandfather in Poland was a Talmudic\nscholar. This was the wife that worked, they had a restaurant, and so it was a\nreligious family. And Uncle Henry --",
        "A: My uncle?",
        "A: grandparents name, it was my mother's maiden name.",
        "A: The one here in America?",
        "A: Her name was Lena. Her maiden name was Ronga. R-O-N-G-A. But, of course,\nafter she was married it was Ehrlich. And, as I said, they were a wonderful couple, no\nchildren. And so they really were very, very good to my brother and to me.",
        "A: Well, Uncle Henry had a variety store. And that's actually what my mother finally\nwent into after my father died. In those days, it was called the Victory Five and Ten.\nAnd the store was on 9th Avenue and 55th Street. And it was sort of like the old\nWoolworth's, not as big, but it sold everything, you know, from toys to pots to dishes\nto cleaning supplies. It's a five and ten, like a variety store. In those days, you know,\nin the 40's and early 50's, that was before all the, you know, Wal-Marts and K-Marts\nand all those discount stores. And they did very well. In fact, Uncle Henry had the\nstore across from the NBC studio on 9th Avenue. And Harry Truman did his series\nthere. And they came to my uncle's store to purchase stuff for -- this was an\ninterview series with Harry S. Truman had he was president. And my uncle went\nover, met Harry Truman, took pictures with Harry Truman, gave pictures to all the\nfamily. And he was like my mom, very outgoing, very gregarious and a very warm\nhuman being.",
        "A: Oh, he would take us -- oh, my gosh. The first -- as soon as we came here, I think\nwe drove to -- was it -- where did we drive? Was it Philadelphia or to Washington?\nYou know, he wanted to show us everything. And, you know, he wanted -- he loved\nAmerica. He was a tremendous patriot. And he always said, you know, when he goes\nabroad -- and he was one that had come to visit us in London when we were living\nthere. He said when I come back to America, I kiss the ground. He was a tremendous\npatriot. Tremendous patriot. So he tried to show us all the good things of America\nand took us to the country. In fact, they built or bought a cottage, a nice cottage up in\nthe mountains, where was the mountain? I've forgotten. Not -- no, they called it rump\n-- it was in the Catskills they called Ramat Gan after Israel. And we'd all go up there.\nNot only did we go up there, but he'd invite my husband's sister and my husband's\nparents. And we'd go up there and friends and we would have picnics and barbecues.\nAnd all the cousins got to play together, you know, my children, and my brother's\nchildren, and my sister-in-law's children who all got to know each other up at Ramat\nGan at my Uncle Henry's place.",
        "A: Well, I'm sorry?",
        "A: Oh, Ramat Gan. Okay. It's a place in Israel, actually, and he named his little\nproperty there after it. It's R-A-M-A-T, and then separate word, Gan, G-A-N. And it\nis a suburb of Tel Aviv, actually, now Ramat Gan. It's a big suburb. It's a diamond\ncenter in Tel Aviv, but he named it after. They were all very strong Israel supporters.",
        "A: No.What happened was that my father -- they decided to open another Victory\nFive and Ten in Astoria where we finally moved. Astoria is in New York. It's in",
        "A: You're familiar with New York, of course. And so my mother, and, originally it\nwas supposed to be my father, were going to open another Victory Five and Ten.Of\ncourse, my uncle had all the connections and all the -- you know, probably helped\nwith some of the financing and stuff like that. And then my father died very suddenly\nof a heart attack. As I told you, he went to the synagogue on a Saturday and had an\naliyah and actually died on the bimah.\nonly one that went to college. But I would work, also, in the store, as well as other\npeople.",
        "A: Well, it was -- we all became a lot closer to each other and realized how important\nfamily 1s, which I do to this day. And my husband and I have made sure that we take\n-- or try to be with our children and grandchildren and go places with them. And\nfamily, you know, became very, very important to us.",
        "A: That we realized that, you know, money comes and goes, possessions come and\ngo, but the people that you love and are close to are the things that are the most\nimportant in life.",
        "A: And we've tried, you know, to -- as best as we can, you know, to instill that in our\nfamily. As I said -- well, after -- well, this is a lot later after I got married and we\nsettled out here, we would do trips and national parks, you know, and driving trips\nand a lot of things with family.",
        "A: I started college in 1950.",
        "A: Right. Yeah. Because the -- yeah, I \u2014 and then I graduated in 1954.",
        "A: Well, that was another thing that really was -- well, I always loved learning and\ngoing to school. And as I had mentioned before, I had been a good student, even in\nLondon, even though it was sporadic, you know, here and there. But I loved to read\nand I loved -- liked to learn.",
        "A: Yes. I finished what is called theBlackboard Jungle, Long Island City High\nSchool. I think that's where they actually filmed that movie, the Blackboard Jungle. It\nwas a tough school. But, again, I tried to tell my grandkids this, you know, it's\nimportant the friends that you make. And people made a lot of fun of me because I\nspoke with an English accent. People often say to me, oh, you grew up in London,\nhow come you don't have an English accent? I said, well, Long Island City High\nSchool took care of that because they would taunt me. And so, you know, I spoke\nAmerican.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. I'd commute from -- I'd take the subway and commute from Astoria,\nwhich was at the end of the line, Ditmars Station, and I'd have to change and\nget down to 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue. But, you know, New York is -- with\nsubways, you can get around. And that's what I did. And we -- you know, it was a\ngood school. I joined a number of organizations. I was part of Boosters, which was\nthe service organization. And, you know, we'd do different functions. I was also part -\n- I couldn't afford sororities, so we had a house plan. And I was in Riner 54. And that\nwas very fortunate, because at one of the house plan parties that we had, I met my\nhusband. So -- and we've been married now for 58 years.",
        "A: Okay. I do, I do have a tendency to jump around.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I took statistics, I took business administration. I did take -- I did take\npsychology, I took marketing, I took English.",
        "A: I thought I'd try and get into an executive training program and work for, you\nknow, a large corporation, a company. And I did work for a while at Saks Fifth\nAvenue.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "A: That was just a part of while I was in school, so it was like, a year. You know, it's\n-- like a trainee or something like that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The work experience, right.",
        "A: Yes. Not very much. Not very much.In fact, my first job out of college, I hate to\neven tell you what I was paid. You'll maybe ask later.",
        "A: My first job out of college was working for a department store called Gertz, which\nwas on the Island. You know, it was easier because I lived there and, you know, I\napplied and I was hired. And, again, they had like, an executive training program.And\nthen I became an assistant buyer in the children's department. And I worked there,\nactually, until we left New York.",
        "A: Well, I would go into the market and, you know, I would work on the floor, help\ntrain the salespeople. Help with the -- you know, pricing and displays and the things\nthat are involved with retailing, which is also going down to the drain as people buy\neverything on the internet.But, you know, in those days that was that was the way to\nshop. And I really enjoyed it. And I liked working with people, both the people that\nwere the salespeople and the customers. You'd also wait on customers. You know,\nyou were on the floor. So even though you were an assistant buyer and you'd go into\nmarket, as you know, New York has a big clothing market. And it was exciting.",
        "A: Okay. I graduated in 1954. And not very long, because we -- I got married in 1954\nright after I graduated. And I, you know, continued working, because my husband\nwas a student. And then when he finished his training, we moved to California. And\nthat was in 1956, so it was really just a couple of years that I was there.",
        "A:I think I was getting $55 a week.",
        "A: Oh, I think that was less. That was less. I don't even remember that. I don't\nremember.",
        "A: In fact, you know, as I think about it, Ican't even remember -- maybe I did not get\na salary. Maybe it was just a training thing. I, I thought -- you know, I don't\nremember exactly about that. But I know that my husband and I lived on that. And it\nwas pretty interesting, because, you know, you had a hamburger, you know -- at that\npoint we didn't take money from anybody, we just managed on what I made. It was a\ndifferent time.",
        "A: Yes. But not before, which is also a different time.",
        "A: Medicine.\nhis internship. And a very good internship at Mount Sinai, New York. But when he\nfinished the internship and he went looking for residencies, they said, sorry, but, you\nknow -- at that point there was a doctors\u2019 draft \u2014 so we can't take you, you know,\nbecause you may be drafted out of the program. And then he applied to something\ncalled the Barry Plan. And that allowed you to take training and delay, but you signed\nup to go into the service after that. You still committed to going to the service.\nSo then he went back to all the same places. He had very good training. And they\nsaid, oh, we'd love to take you, but everything 1s filled. And it turned out,\nunfortunately, for someone, that someone in California developed, as it was,\ntesticular cancer and had to drop out of the program. And the program had an opening\nin Long Beach and that's how we ended up in Long Beach. We did go back later after\nthe service to New York to finish training. But once you lived in California in those\ndays, it was beautiful. And so -- you know, after everything, we ended up back in\nCalifornia. And it also ended up that we brought our parents, both his parents and my\nmother out here. And they lived here for a good 20 to 25 years.",
        "A: I hated leaving my mother and my brother. I really was not a happy camper at all.\nBut I love my husband. And that's where he went, so I went with him. You know,\nRuth, whither thou goest, I will go?",
        "A: Right. Right. And they lived in Riverside. And it was a very good time for them.\nJust my mother, of course. My brother visited, my sister-in-law, and we're very, very\nclose. We had a double wedding with Arnie's sister. In fact, that's why I'm having the\ninterview today because this week we're going to my brother-in-law's 80th birthday.\nThey live in Florida. And we've celebrated our major anniversaries together. We had\nall of our families, all of our kids and grandkids altogether for our 50th anniversary.\nVery, very close family.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I have two nephews. My brother's sons still live in New York, but that's it.",
        "A: Well, I actually worked for a while. Not in retailing, but I worked in a school that\nteaches business. It was a private school. And then I went back to school when my\nkids were in school and I got a master's and then I went back to teaching college. And",
        "A: -- my husband ended up, you know, practicing here. He's retired, but still teaching\nas a volunteer giving back to the community because he loved what he did. And even\nthough he's over 80, he still goes in and teaches residents.",
        "A: Yes, very Jewish.",
        "A: In the Bronx.",
        "A: We're both very committed to Judaism.",
        "A: -- had a heart attack. In other words, a bad, bad family history. I have now two\nchildren, a son and a daughter. They both live in California and they're both\npracticing physicians.",
        "A: Yes. I never taught on a full-time basis, I really only taught part time.I taught at a\ncommunity college, and, really, it was a very good experience. And some of my\nstudents have done very well. And then after that, I taught at, again, state university,\nactually, where I got my master's. Because I knew the people there and so then they\nhired me there, too, and I taught.",
        "A: No, my mother died. She died in 1993.",
        "A:No, she would be -- she was born in 1904, so she --",
        "A: Yeah. But she did live to be 89 and worked in our synagogue, ran the gift shop,\nwas very popular, was very involved in the community and was very happy here, as\nwere my in-laws. Very involved.",
        "A: Well, we live in a very -- you know, it's a nice community. It has its problems,\nsmog and probably a lot of other things because we're ringed by mountains. But a\nvery close community, especially through the synagogue, which is where we have a\nlot of our friends. And I'm involved in something called Osher and something called\nLIFE, which is Learning is Forever, which is through the University of California in\nRiverside which is for seniors. And we have lectures and programs and different\nthings. So, you know, it's very nice being in a university town. As I told you, I enjoy\nlearning. And so, I think -- as I used to tell my students, learning is not for making a\nliving, it is for living and you should learn as long as you can. And so I enjoy that.\nalso volunteer with an organization called HiCap, which is health insurance\ncounseling. Because I helped my mother when she was ill. And seniors -- because I'm\na senior, too -- but a lot of seniors have a tough time navigating the healthcare\nsystem, and probably is going to get worse, you know. So that's something that I\nvolunteer with. And then I do stuff through the synagogue, you know, on education.\nAnd my husband, as I told you is still teaching. And we -- and whenever we have an\nopportunity to be with our kids and grandkids, we do that. When my daughter was\nworking and her husband was working, she sent her twins down for a summer and\nthey spent the summer here. And I'd take them, you know, for swimming lessons. But\nthat was a number of years ago. They now just started high school. And we just\nfigured we had better enjoy, enjoy the family when they still have time for us.\nBecause, as I'm sure you know, Heather -- I don't know, you're an intern. Are you in\nschool or out of school?",
        "A:Yes.",
        "A:Yes, we have. We've been back there a couple of times. Not gone back to\nMoravska Ostrave because I probably would not even remember where to go. And\nalso I've heard that the city is not a terrific place to visit now. But I -- I don't know,\nwe may still try to go back, but I don't think so. But we've been to Prague and we've\nbeen to other parts. And Prague is a beautiful, beautiful city. And, of course, you may\nknow that Hitler had maintained a lot of the places there, supposedly as a museum to\nan extinct people. So the Altneuschul, which is the oldest synagogue, and we went\nthere for services -- is been in -- it has been in practice since 1200. Of course not\nduring the Holocaust, but it's still there.A wonderful museum. Have you ever been to\nPrague?",
        "A: Well, it's an absolutely, beautiful, beautiful city. And a lot of Americans have\ngone there to work, young people, too. So we have -- I have -- both my husband and\nI have been back.",
        "A:Yes, we did go back to Kennington and it really has changed. I did find the house\nthat we lived in and -- but it's become much more metropolitan. You know, more of a\nlittle town or city compared to the country village that I remember. It was really a\nreal village. You know, the people next door to us, you know, had sheep and chickens\nand Marge, their daughter, was my best friend. And, you know, we used to play\ntogether all the time. So I'm sorry that I lost contact with her. One thing I try to do, I\nstill have that -- you know, several friends that I went to school with at the convent\nthat have visited me here and that I visited in London. So we -- you know, we've\nkept -- we're still in touch.",
        "A: No.I think, not only have you asked me things, that I probably, you know, said\nmore about things than you wanted to know. Actually, there was one little thing that I\ndid mention to Ashley before, and that is a story of another cousin of my mother's\nwho left Vienna and tried to go to Switzerland after Germany had already invaded.\nAnd when she got to the border with Switzerland, she needed to go to the bathroom\nher name was Celia Summerville -- well, no, it was Celia Mohrer. She later married\nand her name became Celia Summerville and she was an artist.",
        "A: Celia, C-E-L-I-A, and Mohrer was what she was at the time that she left Vienna.\nShe was a very young woman. M-O-H-R-E-R. And her parents were actually in\nLondon. And my mother helped -- they were older and my mother helped take care of\nthem because they were like an aunt and uncle of hers. But when Celia left Vienna at\nthe border, she needed to go to the bathroom and she got off the train. And the Nazis\ngot on the train and cleared off all the Jews. And then she got back on the train and\nwent into Switzerland. And from there she came to live with us for a while in\nLondon, then she moved into her own place. But she then moved to America and\nmarried a Summerville and they lived right near Harvard on Cambridge Street in\nCambridge, Massachusetts. And they had only one son, and he's -- he's a Ph.D in\nepidemiology. And she -- he was working in New Mexico, she moved there, we went\nto visit her, and then, you know, she passed away and he moved up to Alaska. And\nthis summer, he called me and said he was getting married, and could we come up to\nthis little town of Palmer outside of Alaska so we went up there. So just wanted to\nmention that to show you how family is so important, that my husband and I dropped\neverything that we had planned and decided to go back up there and we did. And we\nwent to the wedding and it was -- he was thrilled and his new wife was thrilled.And\nwe're very happy for him because now he has a whole family rather than being all\nalone. And one other thing I do want to mention, you know, I told you about our\nreally tremendous loss. It was with me all the time, my oldest son. His son just got\nout of the IDF in Israel. He was in the Israeli army. And that's another reason we're\ngoing to Israel in October. Not only for the Hadassah's 100th anniversary, but also to\nsee him and the rest of the family. So that's something you didn't ask about maybe\nyou wanted to know, but --",
        "A:But I just thought, you know, this -- the story of -- she was called Cilly, Celia.It\nsounds -- C-I-L-L-Y. And she was wonderful young lady and I got to know her very\nwell in London. We have some of her paintings, which were exhibited at the Fogg\nMuseum in Harvard. And, so, you know, it's just important to stay close to family. I\nhope you have a good family and --",
        "A:-- realize how important they are.",
        "A:Yes.",
        "A: No.She got back on the train and didn't realize until she realized that all the people\nthat were traveling with her or near her were gone. You know, and then from\nSwitzerland she came to England and she stayed with us for a little while. And then\nshe, you know, moved into her own apartment, and, you know, did different things,\nbut --",
        "A:No. No.",
        "A:No. I don't think there'd be any way, you know, of knowing. But -- and I can't even\nreally tell you what exactly what year it was, because we were already in London\nwhen she came. And she came through Switzerland. But, you know, this was another\none of these stories, sort of like the one about the ship we were supposed to be on\nthat -- you know, it's just by chance that we're here. And that's why it's so important\nto do the best that you can with your life as long as you can. Which sometimes isn't\nas long as you want, but, you try.",
        "A: Okay. Thank you.\n"
