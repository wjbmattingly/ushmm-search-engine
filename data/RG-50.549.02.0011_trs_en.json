        "A: The name of the town was Sarnee, that\u2019s in the Ukraine. And it was Poland before, up til\n1939.",
        "Q: We got a pretty good sense from the first interview about what happened when the\nRussian occupation of Sarnee began in 1939 and then subsequently the German occupation\nhappened and you mentioned a little bit about your life before all of the horror began. But --\nbut let\u2019s go back even farther than that and I'd like to hear something about your family\nbackground, your -- your father\u2019s name and his occupation, let\u2019s start there.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Samuel Schier. His occupation, I call it a forester, but actually, in -\n- in the direct translation, is -- he was a selector of woods.

The p -- the village people, he would arrange so that the village\npeople would take the woods and take him to Sarnee. And in Sarnee they would cut them, I\ndon\u2019t know how they would cut them, then ship them overseas. Some went even to\nGermany, some went to the Baltic and as far as I know, as far as I could understand at that\ntime.",

        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Leah Bourka. And she was born actually in the outskirts of\nSarnee. She was not the -- lived like in a village. My grandmother, my -- my -- and my\nmother was born there, as far as I know.",

Many, many years, as far as I know. So my parent, my -- my family\ndid not immigrated from no place. They were living and we were Polish, like I say. We\nwere Polish nationals. Except our religion divided because it was predominantly Catholic in\nour country and that\u2019s what divided us. That\u2019s nothing, nothing else.",
        "Q: Was your family very religious?",
        "A: No, my family was not. My mother was more religious than my father. My father was a\nvery modern man. He used to travel in his youth a lot. He spoke a fluent Russian. He went --\nthey were -- I understand they were well-to-do, way, way back, before the Communists\ncame to power. And -- and they sized a lody of their property and when they bo -- when the\n-- the Communists took over them, th-they -- the cover -- they took cover in the -- Russia --\nthey lived right on someplace in Orlefsk, as far as I know, from whatever my family told\nme. And then they capen -- they came and they settled near -- not far from Sarnee.",
        "Q: What were the names -- you mentioned that you had four siblings, your four brothers and\nsisters, what were their names and their -- and their ages in relation to you?",
        "A: No, I had -- no, I had one brother, who was I would say five or six and my sister was a\nyear -- a year and a half younger. So he was six, he just started -- maybe started school and\nmy little sister was like three and a half -- three and a half, no more.",

        "Q: So she would have been about nine years old?",
        "A: Maybe 10, let\u2019s say 10, something like that. And she\u2019s the only one who survived.",
        "Q: Before the Russian occupation, you mentioned in the first interview that you had been\nattending school and that you had dreams of becoming a professional and -- tell me a little\nbit more about your -- your educational experience and your hopes before the war began.",
        "A: My hopes -- we were not a well-to-do family, but I went to a private school and I\nremember it was -- Hebrew was taken and then the Polish language. It was a parochial\nschool. And I went to that school with ock Hebrew, with th-the Polish language like I said,\nand my -- my vision was -- I already had my dreams. I wanted to go to school, to -- I didn\u2019t\nknow how in -- in how I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to achieve it, but as a young kid I already was\nthinking -- I even was thinking maybe Ill go to a kibbutz and I'll go to Palestine on that\ntime. It was something -- it was a big movement of Zionist -- a Zionist movement was in our\npart of the country and in my city. And some of my family went at that time, like my aunt\nwent to Palestine at that time, in her -- thir -- in the 30\u2019s. My uncle and another aunt, two\naunts, another two aunts on my father\u2019s side, they went to -- to Palestine. So I had in my\nmind said, \u201cMaybe if I will not be able to proceed with my education down there, my\nparents will not be able to -- to afford it, so Pll go to Palestine and maybe down there I'll\nproceed, or whatever it is necessary to do.\u201d But -- and then -- and then you are asking me\nabout before the war, correct?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. So this 1s -- was up til 1939, I went to this school. And then when the Soviets --\nwhen the Soviets came, in 1939, the a -- the war started with us and -- and as we know it\nfrom history, my country was divided. Poland was divided. The pact between the Germans\nand the -- and the Russian was made and I fell under the jurisdiction of the Soviets and I\nwent to school, proceeded school and the Russian, they call it a dishiturletka. This is\nequivalent to a -- a high school, but maybe in a higher -- something on this nature, in a\ndifferent, you know. I went to this Russian school and two years after the war started with --\nwith the Germans.",
        "Q: So you were -- were you learning Russian at that time --",
        "A: Russian --",
        "Q: Or had you already spoken --",
        "A: Yes, I knew the lang -- I knew Ukrainian a little. But Russian was -- came very fast to me\nbecause I -- I heard around me -- a lot of people spoke do -- th-the language, so it was easy\nfor me to -- to get to know the language and I did it very fast -- I did it -- I did it fast. And I\nspoke the language pretty good.",
        "Q: Did your family -- what language did your family speak at home?",
        "A: Our family spoke Yiddish -- spoke Yiddish amongs -- yeah my father and mother and\nthey spoke to the kids also in Yiddish.",
        "Q: And were you -- did you have a very close family relationship? Were -- were you\nparticularly close?",
        "A: Very. Yes. I think we had a very cr-close relation -- lot of laughing, lot of -- a lot of\naffection for my parents, for my father, for my mother. And we were a very, very close knit\nfamily. And I felt it. And this maybe sa -- maybe this is also -- was a factor for my survival,\ntoo. I never regretted something, whatever I saw around me and I saw the people the way\nthey live in their -- in -- in -- [ -- I just said, \u201cLet me get over the war.\u201d And I wanted to\ncontinue and I wanted to do the way I remember was taught in my family. If we told the\npropaganda what the Germans tried to against the Jews, it did not penetrate to me, it did not.\nBecause it didn\u2019t mean anything, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t identify with nothing. I saw it just all --\nall -- all created.",
        "Q: You mentioned that your father was an interpreter during World War One and -- and he\nspoke -- didn\u2019t you mention that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That he spoke German? Did he have a close relation -- did he think of the Germans as\nbeing capable of -- of what they did?",
        "A: No, my father was a interpreter during -- as far as I -- I remember he told us. He was a\ninterpreter during the second World War and he spoke fluent German. He said they are very\n[indecipherable] --",
        "Q: Do you mean the f -- the -- do you mean the first World War?",
        "A: Yeah, the first World War, yeah. He spoke a fluent German and he was a interpreter and\nhe said the Germans are very civilized people, they are -- 1t\u2019s propaganda. He said he didn\u2019t\nbelieve in that. And the thing they did, happened what happened. It was horrible.",
        "Q: One more question about the pre-war experience.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: I think from listening to your first interview I get an inkling that -- you had a very strong\ncharacter as a -- as a very young girl, that you had -- that you had that. People -- you\nmentioned a couple of times that people told you that you were fast and you were quick and\nyou make it and you could escape. I\u2019d like you to des-describe yourself at that age. What\nkind of a little -- what kind of a child were you?",
        "A: I would call myself very independent. And it were times when I tr -- when I -- you know,\nI used to go out from the ghetto on my own risk. I used to take off the piece of junk, the\npiece of rag from my front and the back, whatever it was and I used to run out from the\nghetto and I free -- I have a free spirit, I -- I -- I hated it to being closed in there in the ghet --\nI hated it And it\u2019s -- the first -- any chance. And I even had the idea -- I was toying with the\nidea to ran away from the ghetto, to escape. I didn\u2019t know where, but I wanted to go away\nand escape into the woods someplace. But I was afraid because if I would escape, my family\nwould be murdered right there and then. And that\u2019s how they kept me down there -- sitting\ndown there. I didn\u2019t know for sure if Pll escape Ill survive someplace. Maybe somebody\nwill denounce me in -- in britally Germans. But the other thing, the -- the -- the other thing\nkept me -- kept me -- they shouldn\u2019t take revenge on my family and that\u2019s what kept us\ntogether.",
        "Q: Will you say something about the town of Sarnee and the relationship between the Jews\nand -- and non-Jews in the area? Did you perceive any anti-Semitism before the war?",
        "A: There was some, some, but they did not exactly affect it. There\u2019s some outburst and\nsome -- from the schools, from the Polish schools, there were -- they were created and they\nwere become Fascists and it was a big influx out already from Germany, I think it was a\nimport from there and it has -- and right away this start, derogatory word against the Jews\nand this and that but it\u2019s not affect us physically or any of this -- of this nature and I went to\na Hebrew school predominantly, mostly the m -- the -- the -- the students are Jewi -- of -- of\nJewish -- of Jewish faith. So it did not exactly affected me, but some kids who went to\nPolish schools, I think it affected them more than affected me.",
        "Q: Did you have friends who were -- who were Polish Catholics?",
        "A: Yes, I had friends, I had friends who were Polish Catholics and especially during the\nRussian, when the Russian came and I went to this -- I\u2019m sorry -- and I went to this Russian\nschool. So I had a lody of my friends were of -- of Greek Orthodox, there is a lot of people\nwho -- down there in my part of the country they Greek or Orthodox or they\u2019re of Catholic\npersuasion. So I had from wode to you know, some of Catholics, something I didn\u2019t ask\nexactly who was what, because it didn\u2019t matter. But I had a lot of friends who were non --\nwho were non-Jews.",
        "Q: Did their attitudes towards you change after the Russian occupation?",
        "A: Not after the Russian occupation, but with the Germans. After the -- when the Russian\noccupation was -- was you know, equality was then -- then -- you know, you are --\neverybody supposedly, you know, the minority, the -- we didn\u2019t have no problems at that\ntime. We went to school together, we went and -- and was every -- ev -- it was very, very\nnice and very, very congenial. But when the Germans came, it changed completely. Some of\nmy friends became not friends. They would see us and they would turn -- oh, I don\u2019t know,\nthey were intimidated or they were afraid or they didn\u2019t want to get involved, I don\u2019t know\nwhich way. And we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t proceed to -- to ask any question, because you\nknow, we were like prisoners in our own city, in our own country. And we were closed in in\nthese ghettos, but absolutely a change. Our neighbors -- our neighbors looked away from us,\nbecause when I lived in the ghetto, we had a lody non-Jewish neighbors, they were\nChristians, who stayed in the ghetto, they didn\u2019t had to move out, stayed in the ghetto and\nbefore we were friendly neighbors, we said hello, hi, this, that and right when the Germans\ncame, and the -- and the import of this venom came, right away they changed their attitude.\nSome of them joined this -- this evil ca -- this evil German, the -- their Fascist groups and --\nand it changed their attitude. But this was the lesser tragedies, you know, what had befallen\nthe -- our people in our -- and my people from my town. And that\u2019s what I -- I -- I can think\nof this -- of this -- actually of this -- of this m -- of this minute. We had a lot of friends that -\n- see a girl who worked for us -- I remember she used to be working, she was a -- some\nmaid, was working, but she\u2019s a orphan. And I remember my mother actually married her\noff. And she used to call my mother \u2018mother\u2019. She liked my mother because she gave her a\ndowry and she married her off to a very nice guy and sh-she didn\u2019t had nobody. And when\nthe Germans came, her husband came and he warned, actually, my family. He came into the\nghetto and he said to my father, \u201cRemember, you know I hear very bad news. I think they\nare -- they are ready to kill all the Jews.\u201d My father had a very tem-temper and he -- he nee -\n- got so upset and he actually chased him out from the house. He didn\u2019t want it to believe.\nYou know sometimes you just don\u2019t want it to believe. You think it\u2019s just spreading some\nrumors, some bate in the Germans, because [indecipherable] situation.",
        "Q: Did your mother think differently from your father or did she go along with him?",
        "A: If she -- my mother -- if she thought differently, I --I never heard, she just -- she went\nthrough one World -- the first World War. So she thought, \u201cLet us just go through it.\u201d It\u2019s\nlike, we\u2019ll go through it somehow, you know. And she was -- she wanted to. And -- and she\nwas expecting, I guess, to go through it. Maybe she was on a more posit -- I don\u2019t -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t -- but she did not verbally, actually talk to us. But she was very much worried, very\nmuch so. And -- and I used to go out from the ghetto, used to bring some food, on the risk of\nmy life. And I told once, a little -- I -- I said I know of on the tape. I went out from the\nghetto with my sister, we took off our rags, we went and we got some -- some blackberries\nand some bread, what I ask some of the peasants to give us. And at night when we are\ncoming back to the ghetto, and our house was right -- we were living -- to the end we were\nliving right by the gate -- right by the fence, not by the gate, by the fence. And down there,\nin a little -- a barn was in the -- in the -- near the house and we made a hole. Through this\nhole I used to go out to the free -- to be free. And then, when I wanted to go out to th --\ncome into the ghetto, I had to open again the hole and come in. And come in back to the\nghetto. And I remember at night, I came with my sister, we came with -- I came with my\nsister and my -- my bag, my -- actually my -- fell on the -- on the ground. And a policeman\nwas walking right in front of our house -- a -- a Ukrainian policeman was patrolling at night.\nAnd when my package -- I captured a package like I carried on my -- on my shoul -- on my\n-- on my back. A b -- like a -- not a backpack, but like a package. And I -- and it dropped on\nthe floor. And he start listening and we s -- and we froze, my sister and I froze. And --\nbecause we\u2019re -- we -- we thought, that\u2019s the end. We were standing down there and he\nlistened attentively and then he went again walking and at that time, you know, my mother\nwas standing in the window and looking and expecting us. If she didn\u2019t got a heart attack at\nthat time, it was a miracle. We opened the little hole, we went in. My mother -- I didn\u2019t\nhevywith to knock at the door, my mother opened the door, very quietly and as long as these\nfootsteps of the German -- of the Ukrainian policemens, he couldn\u2019t hear the -- the opening\nor the closing of the -- of the doors. That\u2019s how we went in and we brought our food,\nwhatever -- whatever we could acquire during the day. On the outside we were free, on the\ninside we have to put again our -- our -- our rags that we are -- that we are branded for\nsomething. And I remember a woman, I remember before they put us in the ghetto, was a\nfriend for us, so she came there, cried, actually. They were friends of ours, the -- the\nUkrainian, there were some good souls. And they said, \u201cYou know -- you know,\u201d to my\nmother, \u201cthis is a bad omen. They are -- they are -- they are putting you all in one -- in one -\n- in one place. This 1s something -- a bad sign.\u201d\u201d And my mother yelled at her, said, \u201cWe will\nloov -- live through this too.\u201d But she -- she sensed that because they went through already a\nwar before and they knew what\u2019s all about.",
        "Q: How long did it take before the Germans put all of the Jews into this ghetto? How long\nafter the German occupation?",
        "A: Months, a few months -- a few months. They ask from all the villages, from all the\nplaces, all the Jews must leave their premises and come into the ghetto. And their orders us\nse -- ordered us in like -- like in -- in -- in five our -- us -- our part of the city was\npredominantly Jewish, all of the Jews, the rest of the Jews from these small, were crowded.\nLike I -- I had, for example, I don\u2019t know if I said it in the tape, for example in my -- in the\nhouse where we lived, I don\u2019t know, 12, 14 people were in there. They slept on the floor,\nslept any place we could sleep. And remember, at night, we used to be frightened to death\nbecause we had a curfew, at seven or eight. What the curfew for the Jews, nobody was\nallowed to go out, anybody was being caught outside strolling around, he would be shot.\nAnd it\u2019s no less punishment was than that. But at night we used to -- we -- we lived not far\nour house, was not far from the gate. Actually when you enter the gate in the beginning. So\nsome -- at night, when we used to hear some trucks would be come in to the ghetto and we\ndidn\u2019t know if this is they\u2019re coming to grab some people -- to grab them from the ghetto, or\nte -- or to -- they are people -- actually Christians who are coming back from work. And we\n-- we heard already the truck passing by the house and going away on the -- on -- on\nwhatever he went, we were quiet down. And in this manner we had to live more than a year.\nIt was an eternity.",
        "Q: Did you work during that time?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Outside of the ghetto? No?",
        "A: No, during the time of the Germans? No. A few times they took us, they had to as -- they\nask us to -- each family had to give a certain amount of work a week. A few times I went for\nthem, silly things are done there. They take stones and t-take stone from one place to\nanother one. All kind -- and manual work, it didn\u2019t mean anything. But I remember working\nnear a bridge and this is also -- I used to get some food, I used to go in -- in the peasant\nhouse and ask him sometimes for a piece of bread or something. And there were some good\nsouls who were helping us, too.",
        "Q: Did your parents have to work at that time, outside of the ghetto or inside?",
        "A: N-No, my father had to work as a laborer, you know. Let\u2019s say -- they would assigned\neach houses, they -- as to come to the Unerat. The Unerat is the Jewish, you know, consul.\nSo it\u2019s the -- a certain amount of work each week. So, my father used to go down there with\n-- with a group of people out of the ghetto. And sometimes he would encounter some of his\npeople who knew him, they loved him. He was known in the whole -- the whole region\ndown there as a good man. And he was helping, we were ourself in artridge, he was helping\nsome actually other -- other people. And when they met him, they used to take their bread\nand give it to him and he used to bring it to the ghetto. That\u2019s how he was, well known. In\nsome of the -- of the -- of the Ukrainian, they were -- and they said, \u201cOh God, what they are\ndoing to you?\u201d And sometimes they were coming and grabbing some of the belongings of\nthe Jews and some of the good souls in Ukrainian used to say, \u201cRemember,\u201d some smart\none, they said, \u201ctoday them, tomorrow us.\u201d And it was that way. And I always say, if I am in\ndanger, remember, you are next in line,[1ndecipherable] if you are not doing the right thing,\nif you -- they are not -- the right thing.",
        "Q: What about your other daily activities during that time that you were in the ghetto? What\nelse did you do with your time?",
        "A: We used to meet friends, among friends and read, discuss things in -- discuss things, in\nhope. We still have some hopes that maybe -- we used to hear news penetrated into ghetto,\nthat\u2019s -- something about the Americans declaring war on Germany, something I heard in\nthe ghetto, I don\u2019t whether they got -- 1t was 1n ninetin not yet. But somehow he penetrated\nnews to us. Because we were not allowed and we had no communication with the outside\nworld at all. There was no radios, nothing. And so we did not -- but we penetrated news in\nthis -- in this respect, that the war started. And also we heard about partisans, but that was\neverything so remote and so away that we did not believe. Here, with the full strength of the\nGerman, they were -- they were constantly on our -- on our back, on our things. We did not\n-- we did not -- we did not know, we just were waiting for a miracle to happen.",
        "Q: What did you hear about the partisans?",
        "A: I heard it after I -- I -- after I read some books, that the first actually dissont was -- was\nthrowing the -- the Soviets -- throwing in the back of my town, Sarnee -- actually the first\ndissont -- are organize a partisan movement, if you understand what I\u2019m saying. To organize\na partisan movement was not far from my city. We heard this, but it did not -- 1t did not\npenetrate to us. We knew that there were POW\u2019s, they were escaping in the woods, but --\nbut it still was not clear. In every little thing was a hope for us, maybe, maybe.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you feel when you heard about that kind of resistance activity?\nDid you -- did you have a strong response?",
        "A: To me it was, yes, very much. I was ready to escape from the ghetto, I was ready to go\nand to do some fighting some -- and I saw the brutality and the way they -- the way it\u2019s\nhappening around us, for no reason, no rhyme, no reason. Wrong was wrong and right was\nwrong. In -- in -- in -- in, you know, in anybody who wanted something to d -- to extract\nfrom you, a Ukrainian who was your neighbor and want to extract some -- some things and -\n- and he had the right, with no right for you at all. He can come into your house and say you\ndid so and so and it was not -- it was not done so and so, but he\u2019II say it and he -- you have\nto gi -- bribe him for it. You have to give him some money and I remember a Ukrainian\nonce walked into the house where I lived. We talked him out of it, but we were scared stiff.\nWe knew we got nothing to do with it, he just came for some -- for something just to -- to\nget from us either sacks of money or something, I don\u2019t know. From the -- because the\ngrown up, they were very worried about it. But we talked him out and he left. And so it was\n-- was very tough -- was very tough and especially for young -- for young people, but we\nhad our hopes, maybe, maybe. Because a few times -- but three times before to make the\nreal acts -- aktion, the real killing. There were like a preparatory -- like for instance, all of a\nsudden there, they said all the Jews from the ghetto must come to an appeal and it was on\nYaki -- on Yom Kippur day. And all the Jews came, they came to the marketplace or\nwhatever, they ask us to come to a certain -- to acertain place and then they ask everybody\nto go back home. Do you understand? They wanted us to prepare, if the real thing will\ncome, we should know the difference -- we shouldn\u2019t know the difference, we should just\ncome voluntarily, because they ask us to come. I think twice was an appeal like this and I\nremember my great uncle and it was Yom Kippur and he wore his shawl, he was praying to\nGod and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going. If they wanted, they come to get me,\u201d but this is what --\njust a false appeal.",
        "Q: Describe, 1f you would, what happened -- there was a night that you went into hiding in\nthe ghetto and you mentioned it in the first interview.",
        "A: Yes, we lived in that aseparation, til the day came, our ghetto was surrounded by\nUkrainians and German police. A decree right -- there were plac -- placard -- placards, you\nknow, placards? There\u2019s a great word, yeah? Was posted on the unerat, on the consul, that\nthe next day all the Jews must come to -- by the gate of the ghetto. And then penetrated\nmost of us, that that night before, they brought a lot of Jews from some small towns and\nthey brought them into Sarnee. Right away a panic struck all the people. And this morning,\nin the morning, my mother came up, she said, \u201cI want you to go into hiding.\u201d I resisted it\nand I said, \u201cWhat will be with everybody, will be with me.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, maybe let\u2019s try,\nmaybe one of us will survive.\u201d And I remember running with a whole bunch of people --\npeople with -- women with kids in their arms. And live ammunition they were throwing in -\n- into -- s-some of them were killed instantly. And imagine the panic? Again my mother\nresisted and where did I went into hiding, I went to my uncle\u2019s house, who was right by the\nfence, if you jump over the fence, you were already on the outside, on the free -- on the free\nworld, or whatever, the free side. Outside of the ghetto. In a -- my uncle\u2019s -- where my uncle\nlived, they had a barn and they had cows before the war, they used to sell milk or\nsomething. And in that barn, they built a double wall and again, a little opening on the side,\nthey opened this opening and the people walked in and when I walked in they let me in,\nthere were about 12 people already down there. And I always say, because it stands out in\nmy mind horrible, this grandmother, this beautiful old lady was sitting down there, with her\ncherch if I remember, a fine woman. She was asking us questions, what are we sitting in\nhere, why don\u2019t you go out? She did -- was in a raid easily, who knows? And I said we\ndidn\u2019t know the -- the answers for ourselves and not for our grandmother. And the night\nstarted and we heard it\u2019s -- the utifar getauchion, they wanted to burn the ghetto. They said,\n\u201cIf we must go, we\u2019ll burn everything, you know, let\u2019s go all in fire.\u201d And I remember we\nwere sitting behind the wall, we heard some people running right behind in the little alleys,\nright behind -- by n -- by us. Running back, running forth. Nothing materialize. They got,\nyou know, the German find out about this sheme and more reinforcement came. From the\nfire department some reinforcement also, with the barrels of water and things. Nothing came\nof it. In this hold, she had -- that\u2019s was the grandmother, her granddaughter, her son and her\nson\u2019s wife was down there, plus other people in this hiding place. In the morning, he was --\nit was a Mr. Loudier was his name. Mr. Loudier was a very respectable, res -- respected\nbusinessman. He was also in the lumber business, but in another town. And they were\nalready were -- were -- were chased out from that town, Lunenietz, from that town and they\ncame to our town, in the ghetto, in there where they stayed in this -- the grandmother, this --\nthis -- this son, and they --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "A: And in the morning, we wanted to find out what\u2019s -- what\u2019s goings on, so we send -- we\nask this gentlemen -- this Mr. Loudier, the son of this grandmother of ours, we send him, we\nask him, \u201cPlease go and find out.\u201d He went in there to the -- whatever he -- they ask us to\ngather together. He come running back and he was white to his face and he said,\n\u201cEverybody must come out from hiding. Anybody who will be caught hiding will be shot\non the spot.\u201d I heard this and I decided to meet up with my family, but the verdict was the\nsame for the people who stayed behind, for the people who went, the verdict was the same. I\ndecided to meet up with my parents and I came, I met my mother and we c -- we went to the\nassigned -- I remember my mother was ki -- was having a little something, some food, some\nblackberries, dried blackberries, whatever she had in the house. A little -- a little package,\ntwo little packages, that\u2019s all. And I said, walking out from the house, I remember one lady\nacross the -- across from our house, was closing her shutters -- and this will stick out in my\nmind forever. She closed up the shutters and sa -- and she said, \u201cI hope my hands will open\nthe shutters again.\u201d She never saw them back -- she never came back. Because this was the\nend.",
        "Q: She was in your same house in [inaudible]",
        "A: She was across from our house. But I distinctly remember coming out from our house, I\nheard her saying so in a loud voice. And a lody were desperate, saying, \u201c\u201cWe are doomed.\nIt\u2019s late for us.\u201d And you know, you -- you know even the most desperate times, you just\ndon\u2019t want it to believe, you don\u2019t want it to believe, you think maybe -- maybe somehow,\nsomething will give. And we give into the assigned place and them bastards German, and I\nsaid the same thing before and if you want it. This German had a cart table, like a cart it was\nsquare table I remember. And he had a list of names. He was red to his face when we\nwalked up too closely, he stunk from alcohol. And he was calling out names, alphabetically.\nPutting them in groups. And somebody who was not -- was not there at that moment, he\nused to mark them off. Like you would go someplace for outing or for something -- we\ndidn\u2019t know at the time what was going on. Then we find out. Putting us in groups, taken\nbehind the gate and then right we were surrounded to Germans and Ukrainians. And they\ntook away the people someplace in the outskirts of town. As my name is Schier, my\nmaiden\u2019s name, so you -- I was almost from the end -- to the end, leaving the ghetto. When\nour time came, I remember this little kid was sitting down there. His parents are already\ntaken, he was sitting and crying. And instead of the German was ready to take the pistol and\nkill him, we grabbed this kid and we dragged him along. And we went outside toward the\ngate. I remember this German walking beside me, he stunk with alcohol too. And he had a\narmband, I remember, with a skeleton on it, a black armband. And something with a head of\nsome kind of -- and one of the ladies who were older, she ask him, \u201cWhere are you taking\nus?\u201d She said, \u201cTo a working camp.\u201d He knew exactly where they are taking us.",
        "Q: Do you remember the approximate date that this happened?",
        "A: It was 19 -- 1942. [indecipherable] August, 1942.",
        "Q: And you had been in the ghetto for a year by that point, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah. It [inaudible] more than a year, 1944 in June. Duatse turovio e uda. In July started\nthe war. The Germans occupied and right away we went into ghetto, so it was\napproximately more than a year.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s pause for a moment. You want to go back a little bit and just -- and just\nmention something about the contrast o-of your life from when you were in the ghetto to be-\nbefore, your life before the German occupation.",
        "A: Yeah, the life before the German occupation was fun for us kids. It was -- we were not --\nwe we-were worried -- just worried about our school. We used to get together and in school\nwere the lody -- a lot I remember good times. We had all kind activities and we had the\nfestivities of all kind and we had I remember even lottery. And this was a, you know, s-\nsticks in your mind. And w -- an-and this was -- and it was a lody -- a lody fun we had at b -\n- you know. And it was in contrast of course, in contrast whatever it happened later. It was -\n- it was like a disaster -- it was -- it was completely -- completely the opposite, completely\ndifferent. And that\u2019s -- what can I add more? That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You said you still had hope. Did you spend a lot of time remembering those good times\nthat you had had?",
        "A: I -- in the ghetto, yeah. When I was in the ghetto? Yeah. We used to get together and we\nused to even -- there was this very s -- very, very -- girl, who went -- she was older than --\nthan I was and she used to s -- read me poetry, she used to discuss some books with me and\nI loved it, to listen to her, she was -- she was older and I looked up to her. And we used to\nhave our hopes. And I remember she was a sick girl, you know, she had some kind of\nproblems. You know, as a kid I did not -- I did not -- not -- I did not question, but I knew\nshe was -- she had all kind of -- but she was very intelligent and very well read and so I used\nto meet her a lot during and in the ghetto actually, when they took us in and down to this\nenclosure, I went up to her and I said, \u201cRun with me.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not leaving my\nmother.\u201d",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t -- Shanedell? I would say Shanedell or -- I don\u2019t remember\n[indecipherable]. Shanedell, I think it was her name.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t Zelda?",
        "A: No, Zelda was a girl who lived with me in -- in the same house. Zelda was a distant\nrelative of mine, she was like a cousin and Zelda had a cast on her leg -- mention to you\nnow? A cast on her leg and she said, \u201cBrenda, when something -- when horrible things will\nhappen, we have to run.\u201d I said, \u201cYou will be able to run, but not me.\u201d And she was right.",
        "Q: Was everyone who lived in the house with you in the ghetto, related to you in some way\nor were there people who weren\u2019t related?",
        "A: No, th-there were some related and some non. And in the other room, down there, there\nwere four in a little tiny room -- there were four people who escaped already someplace,\nfrom Barcel, from Krakow, they escaped the Germans. And they were shaking in their\nboots, they knew more about the Germans than we did. And -- and I remember this -- this\nwoman, with the man, they were so scared that they -- it\u2019s, you know, they were shaking,\nabsolute -- plain shaking. And they knew -- they knew this -- that\u2019s the horrible things,\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s the disaster 1s coming.",
        "Q: Did your f-father and your family start to be convinced at that point that --",
        "A: Yeah, my father didn\u2019t talk too ready, too much and my mother because it\u2019s --nothing\nwas to say. They felt bad, you know, he had to have the kids, he had to have -- and they see\nthat it\u2019s -- who knows, maybe it\u2019s not tomorrow -- it\u2019s no-not a tomorrow, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s,\nyou know they -- they didn\u2019t know exactly, we heard some rumors, they are killing here,\nkilling there, but hear everybody to be murdered, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s something -- something\nwe could not comprehend. And I remember when we were growing up already to the -- to\nthe -- in our group, there was a Madame Klace, was a friend of ours, with her daughter and\nshe said to me, \u201cLook at me,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know? You are so flink, you are so fast on the\nmove,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are young. You might escape -- you will escapes.\u201d Not might, she\nsaid, \u201cYou will escape.\u201d And she said, \u201cWhen you will escape, remember, I have my\nbelongings. My daughter -- one of my daughters,\u201d she said, \u201cwent away with the Russians\nwhen they retreated. And if you ever see her, and if you\u2019ll survive, tell her that my\nbelongings is there and there and there.\u201d I said, \u201cMiss Klace, we are going in the same\ngroup, we are going in the same thing.\u201d And that\u2019s [indecipherable]. I survived and I met\nher daughter. Her daughter came back from Russia. I told her her belongings, her mother\ntold me where the belongings are. I went with her and they gave her back. She could have --\nshe tooked all those things that belonged to her parents, not all those things, whatever apar\nthey gave her and she used to sell on the market and get some bread, some food for herself\nand for her little girl who she brought with her. She was married and then divorced, or her\nhusband was killed, I don\u2019t remember exactly the story. But I met her, it\u2019s something like a\nprophecy and it sounded like fiction, if 1t wouldn\u2019t happen to me at that time. And she said\nto me distinctly, \u201cIf you\u2019Il survive, tell so and so.\u201d And it was to me all so unreal at that\ntime, but here it happen.",
        "Q: And she wasn\u2019t the only -- you had mentioned that someone else had said to you,\n\u201cYou're fast, y-you can survive.\u201d You must have been very -- y-you must have really had a\n-- a Strong personality, or were you --",
        "A: Maybe I did, I don\u2019t know, I cannot tell you, but I must -- I did. I did. And a will to live.\nAnd when they ordered us in to this -- to this enclosure, their right penetrated, you know, in\nthis -- this was my first encounter what a -- a camp looked like. You know, we -- in -- the\nfunny part, our own people from our ghetto build that camp. It was double barbed wire from\none side, one -- one barbed wire from the other side, because the Germans were sitting on a\nhill and this was like in a little valley, in a little valley. And on the -- on the far end was a\nCatholic church. A Catholic church and down there on the left, on the -- on the far left, was\nthe school where I used to go to school. A beautiful school, in my -- you know, I don\u2019t\nknow with my eyes, the way I would see it now, but at that time it was m -- you know, a\nbeautiful school. And it was right on the left. And when they -- and when they brought us in\nto this enclosure, you know ra -- it had the -- all the people from the small towns were\nalready gathered in there, too. We -- I\u2019m telling you, there -- to get a vitass, when they all\nbrought a thing on there. We were between si -- 16,000 people, I can be shy a few hundred,\nI don\u2019t know -- 16, 17, I ca -- I don\u2019t know for sure. But they brought in from four or five\nlittle towns, they brought them in at night. And when we -- and when they -- when we\nwalked in to this -- to this enclosure, we saw already dead people. They tried to escape\nduring the night and th-the blood was dried by the barbed wire. They tried to escape at night\nand they killed them right there and then, they never -- they didn\u2019t took away the bodies.\nAnd we had witness all those things. We walked in, we saw it already, that\u2019s the end.",
        "Q: Had you been allowed to bring any of your belongings into the camp from the ghetto?",
        "A: At -- not belonging, they say to bring food -- food and some of your precious, you know,\nbecause they wanted to rob us from all those things. No, my mother -- we di -- were not rich\npeople. My mother took a little bit food and that\u2019s it. A little bit what she had and a little to\nfeed three kids down there, I don\u2019t know whatever she had, that\u2019s all. And there is a\nelectrician was in the camp. Was penetrated right through the camp that we are going to cut\nthe barbed wire. I start running around and -- and down there, this German and also 1n the --\nand I always try to emphasize this too. In this sea of hate, we were surrounded. Was down\nthere, this German was a olderly, was my father\u2019s age. They put him down there between\nthe double barbed wire with a gun against us and he -- my friend, who I saw her for the first\ntime, went up to him, he had the right to shoot her right then and then. I was staying behind\nhim. And he looked at her, he looked at me and he said, with tears 1n his eyes, he said, \u201cYou\ndummy, you lowvensay from here. They -- when they toachlowt they will kill you all.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cYou dummy, you. Run from here, they will kill you all.\u201d And tears was rolling\nand he looked at me behind and he said, \u201cMy God, I have a daughter your age. What they\nare doing to you?\u201d But we knew our fate is sealed. Then the electrician smuggled in a\nbarbed wire clipper and there were -- the other guy, Migdal, who was also ordered in, he\nwas tall and blonde and always -- always s-say the same thing. Was tall and blonde. And he\nlooked more Aryan German, like any the Germans that was standing against us. And his\nonly crime was because he was of Jewish faith. Maybe he was from a mixed family, who\nknows? I don\u2019t know. And I always will call him a hero. He was one of the two guys who\nwent and he clipped the barbed wire. But before the clipping of barbed wire, I went up to\nmy mother and -- and -- and I said, \u201cMother, I will run.\u201d She looked at the hill, she looked at\nme and she said, \u201cWhere is the decency of the world?\u201d It was none. And she pointed with\nher finger and she said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll remain alive, you should never, never forget.\u201d And that\u2019s\nmaybe was my promise, if I\u2019ll run out in this hell of hells, Ill fight. And if I have to fight\nand I have to die, I\u2019ll die with a gun in my hand. And at least Pll know that I was fighting\nagainst my enemy.",
        "Q: How long after you arrived in the camp did this happen, that -- that the barbed wire was\nclipped and you escaped?",
        "A: Within hours.",
        "Q: Within hours.",
        "A: Within hours. I remember people start running around. I started going around and I said\nit on the tape before, you know. I start seeing my relatives from the small towns, where they\nbrought them in a night before. And here I came across this pious man, my great uncle was\nsitting on the ground with his whole family and they called alphabetically. They were\nprepared, they were organized, the Germans, the killing squads with their organize. And\nalphabetically they call up their -- their little town was Berishnits. They call up Berishnits\nmust come to the gate. And my uncle was praying down there, sitting. And his daughter sa -\n- was standing down there and she had something on her hand. My mother and I went up to\nher and we ask her, \u201cWhat is this on your -- on your hand?\u201d She said, \u201cThis is my wedding\ngown, this is my fianc\u00e9.\u201d And they got up and they left and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the last I\u2019ve seen\nof them. I went up to my zadee, to my grandfather, who is on the picture and I tell grand --\n\u201cZadee, I\u2019m going to run.\u201d He put I remember his hand on my head and he said, \u201cGod\nshould bless you and help you.\u201d I don\u2019t know, maybe he did.",
        "Q: It must have been frightening to make that decision to escape when you had seen all the\ndead bodies lying around of people who had tried before and who had failed.",
        "A: It was a choice between dying or -- or -- o-or running, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t know that I'll\nescape. I thought if they have to get me, they have to get me through -- in the back. So I'll\nwill be dead and if I'll escape, Pll do something. So it was my pure luck.",
        "Q: How did you hear about the barbed wire was to -- the -- the barbed wire was to be cut?",
        "A: Well, you know, that\u2019s like a -- it\u2019s went through the camp, right away through --\nthrough the camp, went through that we are going to try to cut the barbed wire. So there was\nthis Ger -- this German was standing -- there\u2019s the good German, right to the exnim left and\nthen the Ukrainian. The Ukrainian had to be bribed. And I call him the lackase of the\nGermans. They did all the dirty work for them. They were four smarterer than them and\nthey were my -- my countrymen. We had to give him some trinkets and we told him that we\nneed some water, it was a hot day. And I remember the father of my friend who went to\nschool with me, took off his boot -- a boot and he take to the -- to this Ukrainian and we\u2019 Il\ntell him, \u201cWe\u2019ll bribe you, we\u2019ll give you some -- some gold.\u201d And I remember my mother\ntook off also her ring and put it down there in this little -- in this little packet. And we told\nhim, actually we didn\u2019t want him, we didn\u2019t care. We want him just the -- for time, we were\n-- we were -- we were fighting for time. So then we -- he went away in one -- in the other\ndirection, the barbed wire was cut and then how -- that\u2019s how I ran out from there. And\npeople on top of people were laid -- I actually ran over people, all across, because their own\npeople were standing in between, you understand? From the hill they could not cut us down\nwith the -- with machine guns, because their own people they would murder. So, til they\ncordoned off from around with the -- with the -- with the police and with the -- 1n b -- their\nown people, we had time to escape and that\u2019s how I did.",
        "Q: How many people --",
        "A: My mother -- my mother saw me running, she threw my sister over and she said, \u201cThere\nis Brenda.\u201d And that\u2019s how my sister survived.",
        "Q: How many people escaped, apart from you and your sister?",
        "A: I [indecipherable] count how many [indecipherable] maybe in the hun -- a few hundred,\nbut then they were caught. I knew the surroundings, I knew the villages around, so I knew\nwhere to run away from the city. But the people who didn\u2019t, escaped, but they didn\u2019t had\nwhere to escape and they were caught. And I remember while being there in the camp, there\nwas my dentist, who was once a refugee already, she was from --",
        "Q: I want you to take me, if you can, inside of that moment when you were saying good-bye\nto your mother, right before you escaped and describe what your feelings were. Did you\nknow that -- that you wouldn\u2019t see her again? Did you have any premonitions of what was\nto come?",
        "A: I saw disaster. But I did not until -- I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t think. I did -- I was so\npreoccupied with everything that\u2019s happening around me, I thought horrible. I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t think straight. So my feeling were -- were -- were mixed and all mixed up anyway.\nAnd I thought that\u2019s the end of humanity. And I remember this doctor, who was a dentist of\nmine, who I used to go with my pitten there to her during -- before the war. She was already\none a refugee, escape from Warsaw, someplace in Mugrafa, I don\u2019t know. And her husband\nwas a doctor. And they have a little boy and while we there in this enclosure, they -- they\nthrow her in like a piece of rag, like a piece of garbage they throw her in -- into our midst\ndown there, in through the gate. And she was sitting on the ground I remember and had a\nlittle -- a little -- a little doctor\u2019s kit -- a little doctor\u2019s kit in her hand. She was sitting and\ntelling, in desperation I remember, sitting in this position and talking like she would talk ab\n-- people surrounded her. She said, \u201cMy husband was killed in front of me. My kid was\nthrown from my hand and throwing against a telephone pole.\u201d And she sod -- she said, \u201cI\nsaw his head was smashed.\u201d And she was sitting in that position and telling us. She said,\n\u201cThere is not -- that\u2019s the end of us.\u201d She said, \u201cI have 12 or 13 needles. Now anybody\nwants to die right away, one I leave for myself and the rest --\u201d And people stood in line.\nAnd this is something not to be forgotten. And -- and there is another incident in the ghetto,\nthere was Dr. Coen, because he was in Sarnee. Very fine doctor and a nice family, they had\none daughter. And he lived for years and years, as long as I remember -- not like the other\none, the other dentist who came, the -- the war, they were down there, local people who\nlived down there for years and years, is. And when he saw what\u2019s happening, the night\nwhen we had to come to this place, the gathering place, he decided to take with his family,\nhis own life. And he had a little food, whatever he prepared, he made a little party, like for\nthemselves and they inject-injected some needles and they die. What -- what --when those\nGermans and the things ran into the house, they find them all dead. And we were told about\nit because in the morning right away, we knew what they did. Some of our friends, they said\nthey tried to escape, their name was Korobotchka. You know it\u2019s funny, sometimes I\nremember the names, gots -- gets into my head and sometimes I just Korobotchka and there\nwas this -- they were also such a fine people. There was a husband and wife, there were\nalready growing children. She was wearing a fur coat and trying to escape from the ghetto.\nAnd on the -- on the fence, they caught her in the sh -- they killed her right on the fence,\nhim and her. And they were hanging half here and half there. And we knew right away\nwhat\u2019s happening. My friend\u2019s father -- we had our toilet outside -- my friend\u2019s father had to\ngo into the bathroom at night. And he went in and one of the police noticed him 1s moving --\na moving object and he gave him straight to his stomach, a bullet. And they brought him on\na stretcher into the gh -- into down there -- to the camp. And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d\nlike he would defend himself. \u201cI just went to the toilet.\u201d They asks a few people to take him\n-- take him across and they killed him right there and then. People who were in the hospital\nand it\u2019s sa -- in the hospital, they all brought them on horse and buggy down there and to\ncome across the hill and they took him down there. They said they had a undressing place.\nAfter I came -- after the war, after it\u2019s -- everything was done -- after I came, I find out all\nabout they made a -- like a tree from -- from a -- like a -- a tree -- like a -- a round -- a tree --\na round thing with one entrance. And in the inside they ask all the people to undress. Some\npeople didn\u2019t wanted to undress. Undressed -- I imagine they wanted still to save the -- the -\n- the clothes from the people to save for themself. To save or to give away or to whatever\nthey wanted to do. So some people decided no, kill us with our clothes. But this was a\nundressing place. Was made out of brick, actually. Like a -- like a -- a -- a round -- a tute --\na round thing and one entrance. And from there they took him by groups and they killed\nhim and they [indecipherable]. Because one of our friend, actually was down there, naked.\nTh-the bullet -- the bullet didn\u2019t got him in between the dead. He ran out, after mart, in the\nevening or -- or something, in the evening. And he ran out in the -- into our -- into our\npeasant house and they gave him some clothes. And he was -- he was actually a hero in the\nwoods. He escaped and he was a friend of my -- of my family. Actually, he helped me.\nShimone Picov was his name. And so -- and so that\u2019s the last moment when I left my\nfamily. I remember my -- my aunt was sitting with her daughter. You know, when I saw the\nSards family, I swear to you, I saw -- I saw them. Because my aunt was sitting down there\non the ground with her kid, my cousin was standing next to her with some more people and\nthey were standing, I don\u2019t think my -- my -- my aunt could understand what I was talking\nto her. I just observed, I looked at them and I went my way.",
        "Q: Was your father there?",
        "A: I -- we lost my father. Maybe he went because he spoke German, maybe he went, maybe\nhe start a fight with some of the guards, I don\u2019t know. We lost him an-and he -- we don\u2019t\nknow, maybe he killed him right then and there.",
        "Q: On the way into the camp or when did that happen?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t -- my father -- we lost my father. Maybe he stayed behind, he le -- he\nstayed behind, or he went with us. I think -- I know he -- he went and then he disa -- we\ndon\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know, he disappeared.",
        "Q: Maybe he never made it to the -- to the camp in the first place?",
        "A: Maybe he never made it to the camp in the first place, I don\u2019t know. Or maybe he go --\nstarted a argument with some of a German. Or he ask him some questions and they would\nkill and they killed him right there and then.",
        "Q: The -- the morning that you came out of hiding, was he there?",
        "A: My father, I remember my father was there. But then -- then I was -- I was surrounded\nwith my mother, my brother, my sisters and I didn\u2019t remember, maybe my father was -- was\ndown there someplace. You know, because each one -- it was such a confusion, such a\nhorrible thing, 1t was a mess. It wa -- it was not -- not something -- something -- we saw it, it\n-- it\u2019s something tragic, something horrible. And I will never forget this son of a gun went\nwith me, this -- S-Sahartski was his name. We went in the same school than I -- than I did.\nAnd he had a lot of friends -- of Jewish friends and -- and he was older -- older than us. But\nalways he tried to -- to be friendly and this and that. When the Germans came, he joined this\nevil cause and he became a policeman and he was standing with a gun. I came up to him and\nI wanted to go to the bathroom. And he said, \u201cGet away or I\u2019Il kill you right there and then,\nPl kill you.\u201d And this rage I said, \u201cOh God. If I will get him.\u201d So that\u2019s were the moment.\nAnd my feelings were mixed. You ask me, I don\u2019t know. I felt horrible. I felt disillusioned,\nenchanted, enchant? Disen -- dis --",
        "Q: Disenchanted?",
        "A: Disenchanted. That the whole thing was surrounding us. People we live for centuries all\nof a sudden became criminals. I\u2019m at 16, was in there. I was a criminal, for what reason,\nwhat was my crime? We were decent, nice people, we are beasically to our life\u2019s daily life,\npreoccupied to make a living, to -- to do the right thing and all of a sudden, because of a --\nof a distraught man, and he had the power, but the people who helped him and the rest of\nthe world did not makes any -- didn\u2019t say a thing. That was the horrible, horrible thing.\nEngland was quiet. And they paid a price afterwards. Which one -- we had to -- we had to\nget in it to war, because between two evils, they were -- they were the biggest. We had to be\nanyway in the war -- get into the war. And if they would knock down Hitler before he\nacquired so much power, this catastrophe would never taken place.",
        "Q: That moment that you -- that you were escaping and you were running away, you -- you\nmentioned in the first interview that you -- that you got separated from your sister and then\nyou found her again a little bit later. You had -- you wanted --",
        "A: [ran out -- I ran out each for only sil -- I remember with a -- with a group of t -- of two\nboys and girls. I ran out, I stepped over people and some -- some the blood went out -- was\non me. And I ran to -- my first instinct, to go in this church, in this Catholic church. But I\nran up and I said, \u201cWe are -- they can see us. Where can we hide down there?\u201d And I\nproceeded to run. I proceeded to run, my mother saw me, she pushed my sister, she threw\nher over the barbed wire, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s Brenda.\u201d And she was running behind me and\nshe was all bloody. Her little shirt -- it was a hot day there and you know my instinct, I was\nso -- I was so, you know, mixed up. My instinct first -- we said, \u201cThey will recognize.\u201d She\nwas all bloody, I said, \u201cShe\u2019ll recognize she\u2019s Jewish because her blood is on the shirt.\u201d And\nI took off the shirt and I throw away in a -- ina yard and I ran. And I ran to our friendly\nfamily, where they are, our good friends, they are Polish people and we did a lot of good\nthings for them. Actually my mother was instrumental for them not to go to Siberia. And\nthey said -- they used to call my mother their daughter. So the fir -- instinct, the first thing I\nwould run to them, they were not far from down there. I run up to the house and the lady, I\nask her, \u201cPlease give us some water.\u201d Simma was behind me, my sister Simma. She gave us\nsome water -- said, \u201cHide us.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d I couldn\u2019t understand. And down\nthere was -- I think I said it in the interview too, if you want, I\u2019ll repeat it. But that -- that\nfenced-in little yard and I opened th-the -- the door and I walked in and then her husband,\nwith a whole bunch of his friends, some Poles, some Ukrainians, standing in a half circle\nand telling jokes. And it struck me horrible. They saw -- do you understand they could hear\nthe -- the shots? I don\u2019t know that was -- they knew right or mairment or they didn\u2019t know,\nbut when they saw us, this -- this husband of this -- this and of lat -- some of the people I\nknew too. They scow when I dis -- th-they stac -- they stopped in their tracks and they\nlooked at us because we looked like -- like wild animals. Like -- like something escape,\nwounded animals. I was barefooted, my sister were -- was barefooted, half naked.",
        "Q: Were they -- they weren\u2019t telling jokes about j --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what the jokes were all about. When they saw us they stopped the jokes at\nonce. I looked at them, they looked at us and I we -- I went out from down there.",
        "Q: How did you -- so they turned you away\u201d?",
        "A: They turned -- I could understand they were afraid because they could as -- they could\nhave killed them and us together. So my sister was right behind me. I ran in the direction\nwhat I knew where they used to go to my grandparents and we lived also, not far from town,\nwhere we had a grocery, my father worked as a -- as a selector of woods. And so I knew and\nmy sister was behind me, you know, wussup, and I lost my sister. I lost her. I didn\u2019t had\nthe time, I was birf, I was all alone. I didn\u2019t had the time to look for her, I lost her and I said,\n\u201cShe will come somehow.\u201d And I went all by myself. I was afraid to go through the bridge,\ndown there was a bridge. We had a little -- a river sloot. I was afraid to go over the bridge\nbecause maybe some patrol or maybe some policeman with guns, they are standing and they\nwill kill me right there and then. So I went through the water and down there a shepherd\nboys was standing, so I ask him, because we had some -- some -- some -- some -- what --\nthe water, you know, the water -- what do we call it, you know, the -- like -- they -- they had\nsome things in the -- in the water that can grab you in. Kettle? Water kettle?",
        "Q: Oh, like a --",
        "A: Like a whirlpool. Like a whirlpool?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Like a whirlpool. And you have to know because down there it\u2019s -- there were places\nwhere there is those whirlpools and they suck you in. So I ask the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nBrenda Senders. This is tape number two, side A.",
        "A: Well, how do you spell it? Okay, so I went -- I was afraid to go on the bridge, I went\nthrough -- the shepherds guys told me where to go through because down there are these\nwhirlpools, so I went by and I went on the other side, I was all alone. And I went and I was\nwaiting up til dark. Dark, I proceeded my journey and I remember some Ukrainians were\ncoming from -- from the city and I heard them talking about what they are doing, they are\nkilling all -- all of the Jewish people and they were a little bit with sorrow in there, I could\nhear by their voices. But they were the -- but they were about their own business. I went into\nthe village where my grandparents lived and I knew the -- her neighbor was a very good\nfriend of them, so I went in and I knew I had to go in through the back yard, nobody should\nsee me. I tapped on the -- on the -- on the window and he opened the door. On the door\nactually I tapped, he opened the door, I went in and who did I find? My sister and my uncle.\nIt was like fiction.",
        "Q: Had your uncle escaped from the camp?",
        "A: My uncle escaped the same time I did. And he ran also to the same, because we knew\nthis -- this man was a very decent and nice Christian man. Nice, fine man and a good friend\nof ours. My sister, when I lost her, she met up with my cousin and another distant cousin\nwhat I lived in the ghetto, with a group of men who escaped and were going in the same\ndirection. And she came right across the dam and they took her along. And when they\nbrought her to the village, they said, \u201c\u201cThis man 1s a nice man, go into him -- go into his\nhouse.\u201d And that\u2019s how we met, all three of us. And the rest of the people, they went -- they\nwent -- my grandfather had a -- a mill, a windmill, what you use to make flours, in the\noutskirts of the village. So my cousin -- you know, I don\u2019t know how many there were, but\nfour or five men, they went to this windmill and they were hiding down there for days and\nthen they went into the woods. Mostly of the people survived from this little group what\nescaped. My sister survived, I survived and my uncle survived. And from that point --",
        "Q: Tell me the name of your uncle who survived.",
        "A: Uncle Usher.",
        "Q: And what were the name of the -- the family who -- who helped you and who -- who you\n-- the friends of your grandparents?",
        "A: [ll tell you, Austop [inaudible] -- Austop was his name, Austop. His last name I don\u2019t\nknow. But Austop was his name, a fine man. He had a grandmother also, who was like a\nangel. She was a real good human being. I lived in that village for a little while. And there\nwas some good people down there, too. But there was some nasty ones too, you know. Went\nalong the easy way and they thought they\u2019ll have a paradise, they didn\u2019t. The promises\nHitler will gave them, were never delivered to them. He just exploitated them to do the dirty\njob and then he went about his business. He made them his policemen, he promised them\nthe Ukraine to give them, he never delivered them. He never gave it, he never -- when he\nfelt it that they are -- were a little bit stronger, he took away the ammunition from them. And\nthen a lot of them went -- went also into the underground.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in that village?",
        "A: In that village, a short while. I was working a few months, I would say. Maybe not even\nthat long. And I decided to go deep into the woods. I heard that Shimone Picov was -- who\nescaped from the graves like I told you. From the graves, actually, he was wounded very\nslightly. In it -- in the evening he got out from under the dead people and he escape and\npeople -- peasant people gave him some clothes. And I decided to go into the dup-deep\nwoods [indecipherable] Russia. They have a lot of swamps and deep woods. And we had a\ninkling already that\u2019s partisans. They\u2019re and here, we didn\u2019t know where and what, but we\nknew that they are organizing and they are -- they are -- they are grouping themselves in\ngroups. So I decided Ill go down there or I\u20191l meet up with some other people like myself.\nAnd -- but in this village I worked for a woman who used to make sweaters, I remember.\nShe was so nice to me. And she could not understand the politics and all this nonsense. And\nshe said, \u201cWhy they wanted to kill you?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know mys -- I don\u2019t know.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cWhy -- if they will come to kill you, they will have to kill me too.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\ndon\u2019t want you to be killed on account of me.\u201d But she was a good soul. Sh -- I used to\nmake sweaters, knit for them sweaters and work and be in hiding. And I looked like a\npeasant girl. I spoke the language well, so -- an-and she was -- and she used to tell them that\nI\u2019m from another village, whatever.",
        "Q: Was your sister there throughout those months that you were there too?",
        "A: My sister was there, yes. Yes.",
        "Q: And your uncle?",
        "A: And my uncle I separated myself from him because he said it\u2019s too dangerous, a man --\nfor women was easier and I -- I decided to separate from him, not to endanger him and a\nprea group. And then we decided one night to go to -- into the deep woods and to meet up\nwith this Shimone -- Shimone Picov and whatever group he is. And it\u2019s easier now to tell\nthan it happened.",
        "Q: Tell me first, did -- who was that escaped to join up with -- with Shimone. Was it -- was\nyour sister with you?",
        "A: My sister was with me, yes, but we heard that Shimone escaped and he was from a\nvillage, he knew the village people and he was something -- some -- some -- I wanted to\nmeet him because he knew our family. Why, I cannot explain, but I knew our family -- I\nknew he knew the village people and I thought maybe he\u2019Il be some kind of protector and I\nwas right in some ways. So one evening we decided we are going at night, dark at night we\ndecided we are going to that village. And this was like 10 kilometers from that destination.\nAnd I start going by a little creek, a little creek I went. At night it was dark, dark at night\nand at night you don\u2019t d -- I hear the barking of the -- of the -- of the -- the dogs all around\nme and they are -- they\u2019re on -- then there, you know, like farmhouses. A farmhouse\nsurrounded with the -- with the field -- what they -- what they harvest, potatoes and all those\nthings. And each farmhouse had around, you know -- doe each separated from the other,\nlike in here, too, separate farms. And I heard the dogs sunna -- in -- in -- at night. I -- we\nwent around in circle, twice. And I saw it, now we have to take the creek. The creek will\ntake us out someplace. And my sister and myself started walking by the creek and I heard, at\nnight, in the dark night, I heard some people washing their hands on the other side. Washing\ntheir hands and I almost woke -- start blabling out, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d And then I said, \u201cLet\nme be quiet -- let me -- let me think. Let me hear more words, what they are saying.\u201d They\nwere thieves, coming from the other village, who were tilling out honey from the hives,\ntilling out honey and some other stuff they were -- they were, you know, they were stealing\nfrom the village people, but actually, my family lived down there -- and they were coming\nback home. I don\u2019t know -- and one said to the other one, after washing their hands, \u201cLet\u2019s\nget up and let\u2019s go because it\u2019s daybreak, is going to be and somebody will see us.\u201d I don\u2019t\nknow if I would talk to them, maybe they would let us go because we were almost on the\nsame level like with them, they were -- we were criminal. You understand, they knew that\nwe wouldn\u2019t talk against them. I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the chance I didn\u2019t wanted to take.\nThey washed their hands, they took this -- the -- the -- the -- grabbed their things and they\nwent back where they -- where their homes were, before daybreak.",
        "Q: So you and your sister are on your way to the deep woods to find this group of partisans.\nHow did you know where to go? Did you have any idea?",
        "A: I knew Karasin, I knew that I\u2019m going the direction of Karasin. And when Ill go out and\nthe creek took me out. You know, you learn fast. He says, \u201cHow did you learn to fight?\u201d\nYou learn fast. You -- the creek took us out to this -- to this highway, a little highway, it\u2019s\nnot a highway like we -- anything here -- to this highway and we knew this will take me to\nKarasin. During the day we -- I remember we went in -- into the woods, we hide ourselves\nfor some pe -- people who are coming or going somep -- they shouldn\u2019t spotted us. And at\nnight we proceeded. It took us two days til we arrived in Karasin. And I remember the first\nhouse we walked in, the woman cried when she saw us. She said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d My feet\nwere bloody, you know from -- from the scratching in the field with -- I was running around\nand it was already August, late August. And -- and she was crying actually, the woman. She\ngave us some -- some shoes from leek, like in the Roman times. What we make the shoes\nfrom leek, she gave us some shoes from leek to me and my sister and she showed me how to\nwear them. You put -- you put string in them and you wear them like -- in the Roman time,\nlike the sandals, but this is -- the Romans was fancier, but this was very primitive. But you\nwear them in the winter, with some rags and then you put us -- those shoes and she taught us\nhow to -- this is my first experience too, at that time. So --",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- that time that you were in the village, you didn\u2019t get any shoes during\nthat time, or did you lose them?",
        "A: I lost them on the way, yeah. So this is the leek, what she told me, it was torn up, you\nknow, the man actually, from the village gave me, from Cartpelufka, the good man what let\nus in, he gave me also, but then I didn\u2019t know how to do it and this, the woman who actually\ntaught me, this is the way you do it, this the way you do it. And that -- she taught me how to\n-- to wear them properly. So, and I used to wear them during, you know -- til I went in --\ninto the -- into the partisans.",
        "Q: How long were you on your journey?",
        "A: Yeah, on the journey, I -- took me a few days. And I remember going into that village\nand asked right away Shimone, ou said, \u201cOy, Shimone is in the woods someplace.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cWhere in the woods, the woods are big, where in the woods?\u201d \u201cSomeplace.\u201d So I\nslapped over to this woman, who actually taught me how to wear the leek shoes and she\nsaid, \u201cGo across this swamp and down there into -- in the woods, you\u2019ll find him\nsomeplace.\u201d And in the swamp, you have to know what you\u2019re doing, if not you can sink\ndown there in a -- in a quicks -- in -- in a quicksand? In quick -- quicks -- you know, it\u2019s not\nsand, but that\u2019s the -- the swamp actually grabs you in. You have to know what you are\ndoing, you have to go just by the path, not to stroll right, not to stroll left. And she told us,\nthe woman told us. We went -- it took us about three kilometers, we went into the woods\nand when we came right in the outskirts of the woods, with all like teepee. Teepeetel, like\nthe Indians. From straw, but in our -- 1n our country was made from straw. And we saw\nright away and then there were barns. We saw them -- there\u2019s shepherd guys, must be\nshepherd guys. Because there were bottles, there were the teepeetel, the teepee from -- from\nstraw. And I walked in with my sister and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d 1t was daytime. I saw and I --\nand I felt the ashes and they were warm. \u201cWay,\u201d I say, \u201cthere are people here.\u201d I gots -- you\nknow it was -- made me feel good. You know, it was -- 1t was -- 1t was in the woods. And I\nsaid, \u201cOh, it\u2019s some people in here.\u201d So I, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d But let\u2019s wait, we were hungry and\nwe had nothing to drink, nothing to eat. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a village man and maybe he\u2019 Il\ngive us some food.\u201d And we strolled away a little bit farther and there was a guy who had\nhis farm right in -- deep in the woods. And he was putting up a stack of hay, him and his\ntwo sons, with -- with -- with some, you know, with some tools. We went up and I said to\nmy sister, \u201cYou stay.\u201d You know, we were af-afraid of the -- of the light, we were. You\nknow, I said, \u201cYou stay here in case something happen, I want you to know. I\u2019ll go in, I'll\ntalk to them.\u201d I came up not -- not too close, I came within a distance, also I should be able\nto ran if they will have some bad intention against me. And I start asking him if there 1s\nShimone Picov. He said, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s someplace in the woods, with a lody more Jews,\u201d\nhe said. I said, \u201cWe are hungry and I would like you to give us some food.\u201d And he start\ngiving me a lecturing, why don\u2019t I go back to the city, why don\u2019t I give myself up to the\nGermans? I got so -- I got so upset. You know as -- as young as I was, I understood and I\nlooked at this specimen of a human being and I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t came here for advice, I\u2019m\nhungry and I want some food, if you can help us with that.\u201d I said, \u201cIf you bore to church, if\nyou do something,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know about your tomorrow.\u201d And I said it to him.\nAnd he -- \u201cTI -- I'll send you some food,\u201d but we didn\u2019t trust him. I said, \u201cWho knows,\nmaybe he\u2019ll come out with a gun, he\u2019Il try to sh -- to kill us both.\u201d We stayed in -- within a\ndistance and there a guy came out, a guy who was a forester -- was watching over the forest.\nAnd he was friendly to us, he brought us the food, he gave us and we ate and at night we\ncame back to this teepeetel. Why\u2019d we came back -- so I still had very, very, very carefully -\n- before I went in I said, \u201cSimma,\u201d to my sister, \u201clet me listen who are the ke -- who are the\nguys and who are the --\u201d I looked in through the -- through down there a little hole --\npeephole -- and I see there are two shepherd guys laying and down there a guy with a\nsweater with a little boy laying next to him. And I said, \u201cThis must be a Jewish man. Also\nescaped like we did. But if,\u201d I said, \u201cif he\u2019s Jewish he\u2019ll say something, avort from his sleep\nor something.\u201d We were listening -- we\u2019re standing there for hours and then actually it\nhappened. He said something to the little boy and I right away I ran in and I got him by\nsurprise and I said to him -- and I knew the family -- I knew the family, they also were used\nto -- friends of my parents. I said, \u201cWhere is Shimone Picov?\u201d And I told him who I was.\nHe said, \u201cOh, Shimone Picov, he doesn\u2019t want kids, he doesn\u2019t want nobody else, we are a\nbig group and it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going. You take us to Shimone Picov,\nand Shimone Picov will say we should not come, we should be away, we\u2019ll go.\u201d But in\nmeantime I wanted to go and see Shimone Picov. He wanted to get out of the w -- you\nknow, the dealvy task, but I insisted and I went alone -- and I went and I said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and\nPll find him anyway.\u201d So he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He took me with my sister, we came to this\ncamp, there were about 30 -- 30 Jews o-or something, 30 or maybe 35, I don\u2019t know. Also\nescaped the same -- the same day of the same -- from different part of the -- of the -- of the -\n- of the country. And they wind up down there in -- in this -- in the woods. Where is\nShimone? Shimone is going out, he\u2019s like scouting out. And he\u2019s trying to get a -- a gun. At\nnight Shimone came, he had already a gun and I came up to him with my sister and I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m the daughter of so and so.\u201d Tears are rolling from my -- from his eyes and he said,\n\u201cThey are like my children and they are going to stay here.\u201d And he was -- when he said it\nwas -- it was the law. He was the leader of the group. He used to take us and then he used to\nwatch over us. Let\u2019s say he would stay two days in this destination, he would take us to\nanother -- to another destination. We should not sit in the same place, we should not be\nsurrounded by some enemy and be s -- and be massacred. And while I was down there, I\nused to go to the village and work for the people in the fields and get some potatoes and\nbring some potatoes in the -- 1n the -- in the -- in the woods. And I was no obstacle, the\nopposite, I was a help. So I went to the village, I used to work and at night I used to bring\nhim potatoes and he will feed -- give to some food to some other people. And one day -- and\nthis 1s -- I -- amashamont -- one day arrived down there a teacher, supposedly. From the city\nof Sarnee, where I came from. The teacher came and he announced down there to the -- to\nthe -- to the head of the village, that he -- he was sent by the government to organize a\nschool. Do you imagine the killing was going on, the war was -- was -- was going on and all\nof a sudden the Germans are preoccupied to open a school in this particular village? The\nnews penetrated to us, we find out very fast and we knew that something is fishy about tt.\nWe have to watch this stranger, what his intentions and what he\u2019s going to do. Within a few\ndays he was asking all kind of questions and everyb -- and everything was -- was brought to\nour -- to our attention, because the -- the guy who -- the man -- the village man where he s-\nstayed with them, he was a friend of ours. And he went back to the -- to Sarnee, it was like\n15 kilometers from that place on. And came back -- at that time it was unheard, because the\nGermans would have killed him, because they would think that he 1s a -- a spy for the -- for\nthe -- for the partisans and all of a sudden he\u2019s going free there and back. And we knew\nright away that the Germans are send -- send him in to -- to find out if there are some Jews\nthere or some partisans and what the movement and what\u2019s going on down there. And we\nknew we have to get rid of this -- this -- the German. Picov was instrumental. At night he\nwalked in with another guy and they got rid of him. And he couldn\u2019t go no more there and\nback. Then --",
        "Q: I have a -- a few questions before you go forward. Do you -- was your sister still with\nyou at this time?",
        "A: My sister was with me at this time, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And this group that you met up with, that you said Shimone was the leader?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And there were about 35 or so --",
        "A: 35, maybe 40, I -- I don\u2019t even count how many -- but I remember a group.",
        "Q: Okay. And all -- all the members of the group at this point were Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, definitely.",
        "Q: So this is a jus --, yeah -- yeah. So this is -- this is before you had joined up with --",
        "A: With the big partisans",
        "Q: N-Now I -- now I -- nowmosco\u201d?",
        "A: [indecipherable] nothing to do with -- this is [indecipherable] thing.",
        "Q: Okay, okay, okay, I see. That wasn\u2019t clear to me from the first interview, so now that\u2019s\nclearer. And sec -- then -- then, okay I have a question about your response to the -- the\nGerman spy that -- who supposedly was a teacher who came in?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Obviously this -- this is -- this was a -- a very extreme situation and -- and nobody -- you\nca -- you -- you have to question everything before you trust anyone.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to -- to accept that? Did -- were -- was there any hesitation or fear\nthat maybe you were wrong, or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was -- did you feel --",
        "A: No w -- no way.",
        "Q: That conviction?",
        "A: No way. No way we felt wrong. No way we felt we are wrong at all. After we saw and\nwe saw what they -- what some of their allies -- some of the lackase I call them. My -- my --\nmy countrymen were doing for -- for -- for silly thing -- for some trinkets. The Germans\nwould give them a watch to kill somebody. Was no -- not at all. We knew he was a spy and\nwho knew he was doing some bad things. And he was not jus-just a danger to the Jewish\npeople, but for the whole village people. They would come and they would -- they would\nmake a parking ou -- a nothing out of the village. They would massacre with no hesitation at\nall, the Germans. You understand? So there was no buts and no doubts. But this was not\nenough for me, I wanted to join up a big group and I wanted actually to go and fight. And\nwhile I was down there in the woods, my sister was a shepherd girl, down there working\nand I was looking for somebody and all of a sudden, they say a big group of partisans are\npassing by and I went for curiosity to see, I said maybe, you know, maybe. They di -- just\ndon\u2019t take you in just because you -- you say -- you are there. You know, you have to want\nit, they question you, they ask you. And while we are standing down there, a big group of\npartisan on horses, with guns, with machine guns. With this they are coming -- coming -- I\nliked it -- I said, \u201cOh this is -- this is something great -- this 1s something to fight with.\u201d And\nright away there is this officer, I saw he\u2019s a officer, because people were wearing noth-noth\n-- not uniform, they were partisans, they were all a potpourri, with all kind of clothes,\ncivilian clothes, not civilian clothes, anybody -- whatever you had, they had it. But this --\nthis -- this command -- this officer had a -- had a uniform. And we saw by his -- by his\ncoming across to us, that he is some kind of ranking officer. So he came up to us and I was\nstanding there with another girl and we exchanged some niceties and I said to him -- I was\nthe brave one, I said, \u201cI wanted to go in and fight with you.\u201d I said, \u201cWould you fight?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOh, yes. You'll teach me, I'll fight.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not in authority tell you yes and\nno.\u201d He went back to his general -- and he was actually the -- next to the general, the\ncommissar they call him. Politic-Political advisor at that time. Commissar -- it was a\npolitical advisor. He went to the general, he came back and he said, \u201cIf you wanted to come,\nif you\u2019 ll fight.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNow or never.\u201d I decided right there and then I\u2019m going. But\nI had to let words to my sister. That\u2019s how I went. I said to some of the peasants, I wasn\u2019t\nsure they\u2019 ll tell her or not tell her, she\u2019ll think that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the end of me. Anyway, I went\nwith some -- a few more Jewish girls, we went and we -- we stationed by 10 kilometers\nfrom that destination where I started, where it was like my home state on there. Where it\nstarted it, it was like 10 or maybe 50, I don\u2019t know exactly, but this is the distance. Down\nthere we stopped, in that village, for at night and I was assigned to a group. I went right\naway to my commanding officer, I told him that I left a sister. And I told him she doesn\u2019t\nknow where I am and she -- she\u2019 Il think that I am already killed. \u201cWhat is your advice?\u201d I\nask him, \u201cWhat do you s -- what do you think?\u201d He says to me -- he thought for awhile and\nhe says to me, \u201cYou know what? Maybe we can solve the problem. I\u2019Il give you my horse.\u201d\nSomething -- he liked something about me -- a very fine man. \u201cIll give you my adjutant. Go\nback to your sister and tell her that you are in a fighting unit now.\u201d I went back with this\nadjutant and he was sumpalese attatar -- attatar. And he told me some stories that was\nfascinating to me at that time. We exchanged slice, the -- we exchanged jokes and these and\nI told him about my life. And it was such a camaraderie right away. And -- and he said,\nthere\u2019s four barriers, you know, he said_ that they were -- they were, you know, sculpcatters\nor something, four barriers, [indecipherable] on their back, you know, he said -- and it was\nSo -- you know, it was funny. And we came to the destination where my sister was, to the\nhouse where actually I lived in the deep woods, I walked up -- I got off now -- he gave me\nhis horse, he showed me the first time -- showed me how to mount the horse and that\u2019s was\nmy first encounter. I mounted the horse, I went with him and we proceeded til we came to\nthe -- the house. I walked up to the vil -- to the woman -- to the -- to the housekeeper -- to\nthe -- to the hostess of the house where my sister and I lived. My sister was someplace with\nthe cattles, sh -- as a shepherd girl. I walked up to her and [indecipherable] \u201cShe\u2019s the only\none,\u201d I said to her. \u201cNow you are responsible for her, I\u2019m going to fight. Now you\u2019re\nresponsible. If something will happen to her, remember, I\u20191l come for revenge.\u201d I didn\u2019t\nhave to say nothing more. I said, \u201cIll burn your house with no hesitation and Ill take your\nlife.\u201d And -- and it was straight to the point. She knew it exactly because she knew it. And\nthey were anyway on our side -- on our side. I left there and I came back to my -- to my\nunit.",
        "Q: I have a few questions about -- about that -- that whole time period.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You -- yo-you -- was your sister still involved with Shimone\u2019s partisan group at all?",
        "A: No. Shimone -- Shimone -- each was already on his own, you know. There were already\ngroups there, groups here. This was in the beginning, but then start bigger partisan groups\ndown there go -- coming in, so each one was already on his own. Yeah, this is a good -- I --\n[ -- I -- yeah, this 1s very -- to clarify this. Was only so on, so I with my sister, my cousin\nand my uncle was someplace else. But we used to see once in awhile each other, sometimes\nby coincidence, sometimes -- a coincidence more -- more than -- than anything.",
        "Q: So your sister was just -- had -- had been taken in even before you joined this --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Large fighting unit. She had been taking in -- taken in by a f -- a farming family?",
        "A: A farm -- and not taken, we -- we were down there, we lived down there with this farm\nwoman, we stayed in their hou -- we used to sleep, it was deep, deep in the woods. I used to\nhelp her out in the fields in -- and there she would give us a little bit of food -- little food\ndown there, that\u2019s all. And my sister was a s-shepherd girl. It was a help for her and she -- I\ndon\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t had a husband. I don\u2019t know where her husband was -- or died or in the\nwar, I don\u2019t know what happened.",
        "Q: How long had you and your sister actually been with Shimone\u2019s group then?",
        "A: Maybe a few months, that\u2019s all. Maybe not that -- very short.",
        "Q: And then you -- you decided or -- how did that happen that -- that you -- you separated\nfrom Shimone\u2019s group and started living with this woman?",
        "A: Shimone had already -- his agenda -- a Zion, you understand? His agenda. He wanted\nalso to join. He went away, he wa -- he was with another man and he went to some kind of\ngroup, I don\u2019t know exactly, but we were separated from him and he couldn\u2019t take\nresponsibi -- [indecipherable] with the woman and children because, you know, each one of\nthe -- on his own. And that\u2019s what we separate -- it\u2019s a little bit you know, you know, now\nit\u2019s cla -- clear to you more -- clearer to you, the way I describe?",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s clearer and -- but I also want to know what Shimone\u2019s group\u2019s objective was.\nWere they involved in acts of sabotage or did they fight at all or --",
        "A: No, they were just still -- they went in in a partisan group. They just were watching over\nus and -- and then they were looking also for a -- for a partisan group to join them - to join.\nAnd they joined some other partisan group. Actually, the friend of his, Onshineski, I will\nnever forget -- he died in fighting by putting mines on the -- the railroad. He was -- he was -\n- he died.",
        "Q: So there were -- there were no women and children in -- in Shimone\u2019s group then, is that\nright?",
        "A: In Shimone\u2019s -- in Shimone\u2019s group before he went to the partisans. When he went to the\npartisan, that\u2019s it. The -- if there were children, they were not such a thing and there were\nchildren and women there, they stayed separately or they had a place for them. For instance,\nin our unit, we didn\u2019t had such a thing, because we were a moving -- a moving partisan unit.\nWe constantly moved, so we didn\u2019t had no place. If there is some children or something --\nsome airplanes sometimes used to land in the woods for us. So they used to take the very\nwounded one, the very important partisan, they used to take him back to Moscow, then to a\nhospital or something, but on rare occasion. But in mostly of the occasion, we stayed in --\ndown there.",
        "Q: Okay, that\u2019s much clearer. And --",
        "A: Yeah, okay -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s good because you know when I -- when I -- it\u2019s my story, so I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re -- the -- the larger group that you joined up with, tell me the name, if you\nremember the name of your commanding officer.",
        "A: The commanding officer was Major General Naoomoff. I don\u2019t know his first name, but\nNaoomoff was his -- his -- and that\u2019s the way he went by. General Naoomoff. And he\nstarted something, I -- I don\u2019t know the history of his thing he started with five or six\nhundred and then they grow up of proportion. After 15 or 16 hundred. And there were also a\nmixture of people, I say that potpourri of people. There were POW\u2019s, you\u2019ll ask me, \u201cWho\nwere those people?\u201d They were POW\u2019s, who their fate was as bad as -- as the Jewish fate.\nThey -- they used to kill them off like -- like -- like nothing and a lody escapees from the\nghetto. And some who were belonging -- used to belong to the Communist party -- of the --\nmaybe they went down there, I don\u2019t know who were -- the enemies of the Germans and\nthey\u2019re afraid the Germans is going to kill them.",
        "Q: And you mentioned 1n the first interview that --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: That your unit was getting orders from Moscow.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Of -- of what -- what actions you were to take. Were they affiliated with the Russian\narmy then?",
        "A: No, we had our headquarters, our partisan headquarters in Moscow. They -- we had a\nradio station in one of -- one -- the girl, Varla. There were three people in the radio, working\nconstantly. Transmitting, receiving telegrams, telling us how the movement, where to go.\nWe used to know the news from the -- from actually from the front. We used to -- they used\nto get us, the partisans and tell us every good news. It was a big rejoicing for us, you\nunderstand, every knock, every hell for the Germans was a good -- good music for us. And\nSO We -- we -- they were working constantly and we had assignment. Like for instance, we\nstarted from White Russia, I can show you on the map. We went from White Russia, via the\nwoods, we went -- we had our assign -- our -- our orders to go via -- via -- up to the\nCarpathian mountains. Tee inflict hell on the Germans as much as we could. And then when\nwe came to the Carpathian mountains, the front was already advancing very fast, they ask us\nto come back and then they took -- then they disformed us, they took the ammunition and\nev-everybody was, you know, could select what he 1s going to do with his life and then he is\ngoing to doing what.",
        "Q: Were there many Jews in this partisan unit?",
        "A: A fair maybe -- some percentage, I know you di-didn\u2019t went around to survey who is a\nJew, who is not a Jew. But somehow we used to sense, we used to know, among us. There\nwas some Russian Jews, there were some officers, who didn\u2019t go advertising themselves I\u2019m\na Jew, not a Jew, their faith was the same, and the hell we were fighting the -- the same\nenemy at that time.",
        "Q: So there wasn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t sense any discrimination then, for being Jewish?",
        "A: There was some discrimination, but I did not -- you know, I used to tell them back, you\nknow with me they couldn\u2019t go too far. You know, I used to g-go tell them, go to hell, any\ntime and they knew it, that I -- I was not, you know. I was down there to fight just like they\nare there. You should tell me some funny jokes, why -- why are you here -- why are you not\nin the ashcan in the -- in the back? Why are you have to fight? I said, \u201cNone of your\nbusiness.\u201d And all those things, I used to give them straight hell, right from the beginning.\nSo they didn\u2019t had too far to go as far I\u2019m concerned. And I -- I didn\u2019t feel, not exactly.\nBecause the assignments were the same, the fights were the same, we went in the same thing\n-- same -- same places, same things. So I did not, this is no.",
        "Q: It sounds like you were --",
        "A: And I didn\u2019t look for -- I -- maybe I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know, I did not.",
        "Q: You -- it sounds like you were a very self-confident young woman.",
        "A: Maybe, I don\u2019t know, maybe. I -- I felt that I didn\u2019t see no other -- no -- no other ways.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t doubt.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t get out -- I didn\u2019t went around with a -- with a placard over -- you\nunderstand? I did not. What -- if they ask me, I said it. I lost my family, I used to -- I\u2019d tell\nthem the way -- the way it happened. And of course the officers and that -- he knew that. A\nfor instance, I -- when we -- we had an order coming from White Russia. We had to go into\nmiciedis army. My general knew that I\u2019m from down there someplace. And I was in the\ngroup. It was quite a honorary thing -- assignment. I was in the group the cult\ncommandantskits wart. Actually, who --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nBrenda Senders. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: So I was in this commandantskits wart, this is a -- a honorary, you know, actually to --\nyou are responsible for the -- for the general, for your commanding officer. And -- and it\nwas -- it was -- I felt good about it. And we had to pass by my city and somehow the orders,\nI didn\u2019t know about it, the orders came that we are going to go and my general came up to\nme, he said, \u201cBrennaslava,\u201d he used to call me Brennaslava. He used to call me\nBrennaslava, you know, in Russian. \u201cBrennaslava, we are going -- maybe we\u2019ll go into your\ncity. Do you have some accounts to pay?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I have a few of them.\u201d And -- but we\nnever walked -- we never. We had to surv pass -- we had to g -- pass by the city of Sarnee.\nWe never went in, we went in on our destination because you know, it\u2019s not written in stone\nduring the war, it changes from minute to minute and the orders and everything because the\nstrategic point and thing and the fights and the retreating of the army and all those things.\nOne thing I know, we gave them hell. Whatever m-my human mind could -- could ever\nthink about it. That\u2019s what we inflicted on the Germans.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to decide between two questions. Okay, what -- how many other women were\nthere in the group?",
        "A: I would say 10 percent.",
        "Q: 10 percent?",
        "A: Maybe so, maybe more. I don\u2019t -- something. I had always my friend Taska, she was like\na tomboy. She -- I always have a good feeling about her. Taska, I used to go right all -- al-\nalways with her. And the guys, oh they would not bu-budge with her. She used to give them\nhell, straight. From start to the end. But we had about 10 percent and her sister -- she was\nmarried, oh -- that\u2019s why her fianc\u00e9 -- she fell in alive to the German hands. And this was a\ntragedy. Because alive -- or maybe she killed herself because every partisan was encouraged\n-- they have a grenade with him, in case he fell ins the Germans, he should kill himself.\nBecause we knew that they will ki -- cu -- not just they will -- they will torture you to death,\nthey will want extract some information. But you didn\u2019t know and if you knew -- if you\nknow the information, you wouldn\u2019t give them. Do you understand? There was a -- a very\nvicious circle. So every partisan knew there is -- we can not give ourselves alive to the\nGermans.",
        "Q: You must have gone through some kind of training.",
        "A: We did. Very fast ones. We used to stop in the village -- I remember we had a major who\nused to take us out to show us, you know, to ride -- riding the horse -- but this is what -- not\nimportant. Other time -- but anyway, he was showing us how to ride or take a lower part, to\ngo fast or to go slow, whatever. And then we used to have targets, what we used to --\nshooting targets, actually we sh -- came down there and we used to -- we used to train\nourselves. It was not too long, but it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s not a big theory, you know soon, but you have\nto do it, you do it fast. If your life -- 1f your life is at stake, you understand? You do it. Or\nyou do it or you die, one of those two things. There was no -- nothing -- nothing in between.\nAnd because I choose life, maybe I\u2019m here still. And maybe, I don\u2019t know, sometimes I\nthink maybe I -- I was braver than my brains [inaudible]. But here still I am utathi. Against\nall the odds, I survived. So there is rhyme or reason, I don\u2019t know. Maybe you can tell me, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You were am -- one among relatively few women and you were -- you -- it sounds as if -\n- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that you had the same role to play as the men. That you were\nfighting and you were involved -- I gather from your first interview -- in acts of sabotage --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And was there -- was that unusual? Were women given -- were women generally given\nthese -- these roles within the group?",
        "A: No, no. It depends in the group where I stood on watch or I stood on watch or I had to\npull the trigger or whatever it 1s, 1t was nothing. That was -- you know -- the guys there\nwere more -- more -- knew -- knew more, so they went ahead, where they were already\nexperienced in this particular thing, they were went ahead. If I had to go, I went with him.\nLet\u2019s say if you had to put the -- we used to call TNT on the -- the railroad, like little\nsquares, TNT?

But we used to do it in three, four places, because the Germans would --\nwould put it back -- the rails -- in one, two, three, you understand? If it was in one place, but\nin three places, they would derail and then we had time to make our -- a hell out of them.",
        "Q: Who was responsible for domestic chores like laundry and cooking and so forth?",
        "A: Each one. Each one was his own, okay? We went -- in the woods for instance, I used to\ncome in the woods -- I think that\u2019s funny -- I used to come in the woods and I use -- I -- I --\nI\u2019m ac -- I\u2019m aclean person by then, so I used to take another girl and I used to put a little -\n- a little like whatever I had, around me and take a little water and wash myself, you know,\nwash mys -- cold as it was, you know -- below zero, how much we had snow down there\nand it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- it\u2019s cold as -- as hell down there in my country that I come from, in\nthe winter. And anyway, in maybe this I was not sick, you know, because I haven myself.\nBecause we did not -- you know, and I used to wash my body usadine and then when we go\ninto a village, we occupy a village or we stationed in a house and 1n the house there were\nwater, I used to get water from the well and --",
        "Q: How did you get food?",
        "A: By acquiring, by going -- you are people with guns. You go in, nobody would say no to\nyou.",
        "Q: So you would never -- you would never cook in the woods or --",
        "A: Yeah, there is some instances what we did, but mostly no, because there are --sometimes\nwe used to go parallel with the Germans and this was a no-no, we\u2019re not allowed. The\nGermans used to go on the highway, we used to go straight to them, to inflict on them\ndamage, whenever we -- it\u2019s a possibility, whenever we ne -- we had to. We used to go\nparallel, they would go on the -- on the highway, we would go parallel in the woods. And I\nknow for a fact and I said it in -- down there I think on the tape. I know it. The Germans\nwere afraid they went to go in to relieve themself in the woods. Because they knew that\nsomething is awaiting them. They used to be scared of the eastern front like hell, because\nthey knew the damage they were -- they had done to the people and what kind of hatred we\nhad against them. So, this is what my -- my reward against them.",
        "Q: Did you have -- so -- so there are hundreds of -- of people in this group and everyone --\nam I right to -- it sounds like everyone shared everything, nobody had a real special job -- a\nspecial task that they were responsible for? What kind of organization was there?",
        "A: Well for instance -- a for instance, yeah, the radio operator, they had three -- they had\nthree people were working constantly radio. There were demolition, you know, what you go\ninto -- then -- they were sending each time another group or another people or sometimes\nthe same, it depends, because we were moving constantly. A -- for an instance, we were in\nthe -- we occupied a village -- let me give you a s -- a example so you -- you understand the\nmagnitude. We occupied a village. I was in the group at that time, who -- we occupy a\ncertain destination. You put 1n a -- you put it in a -- on the entrance of the village and the\nexit of the village or -- or both entrances of the village, you put it in like a machine gun, a\nguns, a few -- a few sentries, a machine gun and you allowed people to walk -- to get into\nthe village, but nobody\u2019s allowed to get out from the village. And I remember we occupied\none village in -- it was on the -- on -- on the eastern -- not far from Shitoma. Someplace not\nfar from -- in that direction. And we walked in -- it was -- our village was in the valley and -\n- and it was surrounded with little hills. And somebody must -- if the Germans find out -- in\nthe morning we were surrounded from the hills by the Germans and they have the better\nposition on us, because we were in the valley, we were in the -- on the -- on the bottom. As I\nwas at -- razvere -- no -- right, yeah. So I -- we needed some ammunition to get. The surplus\nof ammunition was down there, like three or four houses away. We used to get it in the\nhorse and buggy, on wagons, you understand? It was not suffish to get at now. This on\nhorse and buggy, it was on wagons. So the -- we needed, for the machine gun, we needed\nsome bullets. And -- and our commanding officer said, \u201cI need the bullets.\u201d You know, we\nsaw it already, surrounded by the Germans. And I said, \u201cI know exactly how to go the back\nway and I\u2019ll go.\u201d And I went the back way, I went out down there to the horse and buggy, I\ngot the ammunition, I got the -- the -- the -- a whole big bag of ammunition, of the bullets\nfor the -- for the -- for the machine gun and by coming back, already the houses, where I had\nto go to hide myself -- to -- to crawl under them, was already burning. The -- the -- because\nwe have straw in our country, that\u2019s straw on the -- on the -- on the -- on the thing. So right\naway they put it in, they -- they throw in some bullets, it starts a fire. In the straw it started\nright there and then. So when I was coming back with the bullets, already each house was\non fire. I ran in and I remember I tumbled under the -- the house with my -- with my bullets\ntrawling behind -- grabbing, schlepping like with me. And I walked up and I had to go from\none -- from one house to another one. I tumbled again, I went in and down there I saw my\npartisan friend. Ivania was his name. I yelled to him, he was laying -- because I recognized\nhim by his -- by his -- by his -- by his dress, by his red jacket, a shepherd jacket -- in sh-\nsheepskin jacket. So I recognize -- I said, \u201cIvania, cover me, it\u2019s me, we should start\nshooting and I can go by.\u201d He didn\u2019t responded to me and I got mad and I start yelling at\nhim because I thought he\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s co -- y-you know, a coward there -- he -- he\u2019s --\nhe\u2019s scared. But Ivania was dead. A sniper got straight to his head, because the next day was\nthe funeral. Anyway, I tumbled through it, I went down through a well. You know the wells,\nyou know, like a | -- during Lincoln times and everything here, I [indecipherable] the well\nand I came to my unit and I gave them -- handed them the -- the bullet. They said it also. He\nsighted ee, my -- my -- my officer -- when he -- when I came in, I brought them in there.\nAnd one time my general told me, \u201cBrenda, you\u2019ll live a long life.\u201d And I say always,\nmaybe he predicted right.",
        "Q: And why did he say that?",
        "A: Because I came from another -- from another -- I left my bullet -- my bullet belt and I\nwent also to the -- I di -- I told them the thing 1n the --",
        "Q: Yeah, that story is 1n the -- is in the [indecipherable], yeah.",
        "A: So when I came back, he said it, you will live a long life. Wesided because I pinched\nmyself and I ran into the woods. And then we had to retreat. We had to -- we had to deceive\nthe Germans too, in any way we could. So we came, the fight ended a few hours and then a\nplane came. We used to call it the Rama and this is like a -- a frame plane. And this -- the\nframe plane used to take -- used to take pictures of the terrain and of us and of moving\nthings and we knew it -- this -- this plane will go away within a f -- an hour or two, we\u2019ll\nhave bombs on our heads. So we have to skedoodle, we have to get out from there very fast.\nSo we left some old rags, I remember at that time, some old horses, some old things what\nthey could not be taking with us, to pretend that we are still down there and we moved out.\nAnd I remember there was big opening, a big clearing in the woods. They asked the\npartisans to go backwards, like -- like to step backwards. They should -- when he comes\nwith the plane to -- to take a look, so they see these people get in, but not out. But actually\nwe -- this was our deceiving them. And we went around the clearing. And after -- and after\nin a few hours, the bombs came. We asked the people of the village -- we told them -- we\nwarned them, everybody run for your life, because they will be on your backs. And it was\nthat way, within a few hours. The planes were there and they made a mess out of the village\nand the people who were -- who were down there left over, they were all dead. And we were\nbehind them. We were spectators. We were standing in the woods far away and we were\nseeing the whole -- the whole thing, the whole happening, what\u2019s happened. I remember\nstanding next to Taska, you must remember Taska -- Taska. I was standing down there and\nwas still -- was a happening. There was this -- Varla was her name, one from the radio\nstation. She used to write a daily -- dai -- a -- a nievnik we call it, you know, a -- a diary.\nAnd -- and it struck me at one point very funny because here we are fighting anee. I used to\nask her -- Varla -- we -- we liked each other and I said, \u201cVarla, do you think we will read --\nwe will live through to see it?\u201d She said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I think we will.\u201d I said, \u201cI\nhave hopes we will.\u201d And she did. And I did [inaudible] here.",
        "Q: Were you limited in any way, being a -- being a girl -- a -- a young woman in this\nsituation?",
        "A: That was not a easy task, but I stood my ground. I said it\u2019s not the time, not for romance,\nit\u2019s not the thing, I didn\u2019t want none of those. There were boys and you know, I was\nattractive, I would say. I tried, you know, to be. I pushed away. I said it\u2019s not the time, it\u2019s\nnot the place to get involved in what\u2019s then.",
        "Q: Did anyone question your ability as a fighter? Being a young woman, were you limited\nin that way?",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t question my ability. We were learning how to shoot -- how to -- to\nthrow a grenade, that\u2019s not a big theory. You -- you want it, you -- you know, you -- you\nwanted to do it. So questioning was not or you didn\u2019t do the job, so they -- you had to.",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t reserve certain jobs for men and other jobs for women?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, maybe there were some. I -- I -- on assignments, I remember the first time\nthe general -- I was -- was riding 1n the -- 1n this group and he send me -- I didn\u2019t know even\nit was such a dangerous -- a mission. He send me to another village, then th -- he told me a\nname, so and so and so. He gave me some -- a piece of paper, then I -- I had to bring him\nsome information from down there. Even I came back, I was so shy in dahell, I was shy. I\nhad to report to him. I was standing behind the door, I remember, til I walked in and I said,\n\u201cYou know, my mission\u2019s accomplish in this.\u201d And it was a dangerous mission because,\nyou know, I was all alone and somebody could ambush me, it could be the end of me. But,\nyou know, you don't think in the moment when you are involved in it. You wanted to live,\nbut -- and you\u2019re always on the watch, you\u2019re always, you know -- that nobody should get\nyou. I remember once standing in the woods, all by myself and -- and any -- I was so -- I\nwas so hyper. Any -- you know, there were birds, there were thing, it was cold, it was\nalready in -- in -- in har -- in -- you know, not spring, but --",
        "Q: Fall?",
        "A: Fall. And, you know, some birds, some snakes, some little animals in there. And I was\nstanding in there by myself and it\u2019s away from the company, away from the group, from the\npartisans. I had to be like a warning shot, if somebody comes in, I should give a warning\nshot to them. And I stood on there for a few hours and it was, you know, I get chills in my\nback. You understand? Because I was afraid it\u2019s not just so -- that somebody from a tree\nshould jump on me, you understand? Bu -- sh -- ch -- somebody from a tree should jump on\nme and overpower me. Not because -- because I was ready with my gun, I was ready to s --\nto -- to take my position -- to do whatever I had to. But you understand, it was -- because I\nwas alone and I felt a little bit uneasy at that time. So this was every day there happened and\nit\u2019s a constant, constant. And there were guys, they are brave -- they are -- they were\nfighters -- they were -- they -- I know we paved the way to liberation. We paved the way.\nAnd in the eyes of the military, we looked like heroes to them. I didn\u2019t know even, at that\ntime. We looked -- be-because they knew we were volunteers, we went to fight -- fight them\nto the end. And we did and they\u2019re af -- they\u2019re afraid of us like -- they used to send\ndivisions to get the partisan -- to find the partisans. They never did. Of course we had a lody\nof -- of -- on our side too, a lody -- a lody, y-you know, whatever you say -- of fallen\nsoldiers, some were -- were without legs, some without -- hand. And I remember penicillin\ncame into our midst, you know, the Americans send us penicillin, a lot of our partisans were\nhelped by the penicillin.",
        "Q: Did you have doctors or n-nurses among you?",
        "A: We had a bath surgeon, yeah -- I\u2019m sorry -- we had a surgeon and assistant and a doctor.\nValentina was her name and she was also very friendly with me. But the surgeon used to\nperform surgery right on the spot. Sometimes he could not succeed, because the winter and\nthe hind and the infection and the limited of -- of -- of medication. But the penicillin helped\nsome of them because the gangrene wouldn\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t set it. The -- the infection would\nfight off. And we had always nice words, you know, I never -- they ask me how, many\ntimes. They had the [indecipherable] words against the Americans, no. The nicest\n[indecipherable]. And don\u2019t forget, they were allies of ours. Then, of course, politically.",
        "Q: Okay. Why don\u2019t you tell me how the -- how you learned that the war ended. Were you -\n- were you with the partisans at that time? Which happened first? The Jew -- did the\npartisans disband or did the war end first?",
        "A: Partisan disband because the front was advancing so fast, this -- the partisans we didn\u2019t\nhad no -- no more -- they were -- they were chased out from Poland and they were going\nsuch an afr -- in a very fast pace. That\u2019s -- we -- that says our job was accomplished. So we -\n- we were asked to come and we -- we disbanded. And take away our ammunition and then\nwe came to the city of Rovno and then there, we gave our ammunition and each one -- they\nask what -- our whole commission of people, they ask who wants to do what. I thought for a\nstrangid idea to go in to take some languages and to go to college, where they would -- to go\nto the university, but they would have helped me at that time.",
        "Q: Who would have helped you?",
        "A: From the partisan headquarters. They would have helped me because I was fighting\nduring the war. They would give me maybe even a tutor to prepare me. But then I had my\nsister and somehow it -- everything it changed. And then start the movement of leaving in\nthe Soviet Union. People start leaving the Soviet Union and going up west. And I decided I\nhad it enough. I didn\u2019t had nobody. I lost everybody and I don\u2019t want to be on the bloody\nheart any more. It was too painful. I looked in everybody\u2019s eyes and I was ashame of\nmyself. I said, \u201cMaybe they were helping the Germans to find little kids, little Jewish\nchildren.\u201d They were kids, they were adorable as I remember them. So I decided to leave.\nAnd I remember when the war -- the war ended and they announced on the radio. So they\ncame to the municipality. And there were rockets and there were big festivities and people\nwere rejoicing and I rejoiced of course with them, because the evil was conquered, it was\ndown to earth, was -- was -- was beaten to -- to the ground. But I -- I looked left and I\nlooked right and I did not laugh or to -- or to cry, because I lost everybody. And I\u2019m -- it\nwas among those people living for centuries.",
        "Q: Had you had any chance to grieve, up until that point, for your family?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s funny, no, you know, I didn\u2019t. You know what struck me very much,\nthough? When I gave my ammunition back and I came up to Dubnow, was a city, Dubnow\nand I came right away, I asked some Jewish people alive, so they used to point it out, this\nhouse, that house. And I came to one house and I -- we were like a novelty, I and I have a\nfriend of mine. A novelty when we told them we were partisans, we were fighting, we were\nhealthy looking. And they came out, they were all, you know, white face, they were hiding,\nthey were doing whatever, I don\u2019t remember, even. And there was some kind of rabbi, all\nwas hut in there amongst them who survived. And I told him -- he asked me, I said, \u201cMy\nparents.\u201d And he said kaddish and that\u2019s what struck me, right then and then, you\nunderstand? Because I was busy constantly, with fighting, with doing the things I was\ndoing. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s when it struck me really hard. And I -- and I saw the reality of the\nwhole thing. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- I -- I -- and another thing. When I came -- we erected --\nthe survivors -- there survived a few survivors from my town. We decided to erect on the\nplace where they murdered the -- the -- the thousand and thousands of people, we decided to\nput on there a monument. When I came down there after the place, because I escaped from\nthat enclosure -- we cut the barbed wire, we ran out. The rest of the people were taken over\nthe hills, were taken a kilometer or two in the woods and down there -- ditches were\nprepared and they did it -- what they did in every other place. The same thing, I understand.\nI was not there because I wouldn\u2019t be here. And so -- so when I came down there and we\ncame down there and we were standing down there, over the place actually, you know,\nwhere my parents, my little sister, my little brother maybe down there lay. You know I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t put a tear out of my eyes. I stood down there like a -- like a stone. I --\nin -- and it made me angry, you understand? It made me mad like hell. Because something 1s\nin -- I feel the pain and here I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t express it outside. Then of course, you\nknow, little by little, the start pouring out -- out of me. But it was very sad. Very sad and\nvery unjust, what I was looking the unjustnessty. Th-The terrible thing was down -- my\nfamily was a beautiful family. We were not rich materially, but my father was, I think, you\nknow -- I look at the pictures sometimes, the kids say he looks like Prince Philips. I says,\n\u201cHe was a prince in his own right.\u201d He was a -- he was a great man. He was a good man. He\nwas helping his fellow citizen, he was helping his fellow -- whatever he could. He was in\nthe forest, if somebody needed some wood for the house to build, he used help him out.\nBecause the -- he knew their -- their struggle. You understand, he knew their strugg -- and\nhe was good by heart. Our son 1s just like it -- like -- like his grandfather. So this is -- this 1s\nall the -- the things what -- what has struck me very, very badly. If you didn\u2019t have time to\ngrieve, where do you -- how -- how do you? We were all the same, we used to talk and we\nused to reminisce and we used to tell how and what and that\u2019s about that. We -- we -- had no\n-- to go to psychiatrist or to do those things, we just in our own heads, in our own thing, we\nmade -- and at least we accomplished something. When I saw -- when I saw the crushing of\ntheir army -- the big superman, they were not supermen. Hitler taught them mean they are\nsupermen. Of course they were supermen against women and children. Against women and\nchildren, was supermen. Because they had the guns, we were not prepared for them. But\nthey were not supermen after they start getting a beating. The partisan gave them from one\nside and then the army, they retreat and under Stalingrad. I think that was the beginning of\nthe defeat. In the winters in Russia. And he -- he paid a price. It\u2019s not enough, the way I see\nit, but that\u2019s -- at least.",
        "Q: Did you learn about the -- what was going on in the concentration camps while you were\nwith the partisans?",
        "A: No [inaudible] not at all. We didn\u2019t know. And the funny part, when I was in Treblinka,\nthat\u2019s what got the guts out of me. Treblinka sits in the woods and when I -- we went in -- in\nTreblinka was one -- one -- one rail -- one -- one train what take you in and it struck me so\nbad because that\u2019s the end, you understand? Like this line, this is it. And most of the people\nwere murdered down there, except for some cleaning up, whatever. But ever the people\nwere brought down there, that was the end, that was a massacre. And this has struck me and\nthe funny part, I looked right and I used to look left, at the homes of the Poles who lived\ndown there and whenever I saw a old house, I said, \u201cDammit, those people were being\ndown there when those people were bringing in the thousands. And they didn\u2019t raise their\nvoices, they didn\u2019t say nothing to nobody.\u201d On this I -- I felt very -- and in the woods, was\nthe whole camp situated, with the birds singing in the quietness of that place, in the woods\nsurrounding, I said, \u201cIf we partisans would have come down there, you don\u2019t know what we\nwould have done to those Germans.\u201d",
        "Q: When were you there, in Treblinka?",
        "A: Two years ago, with the march of the living. That\u2019s my first reason back, I never was in a\nconcentration camp. After the war, we find out the tragedy, but during the war, we didn\u2019t\nknow the magnitude of building factories and killing people, they didn\u2019t know. He deceived\na lot of people, but they -- and I\u2019Il repeat --",
        "Q: I'd like to know how you -- how you responded to the news about the camps when you\nlearned about what had happened?",
        "A: Terribly, it\u2019s behind -- it\u2019s behind understanding, behind. It was -- I don\u2019t know, it was\nsuch a -- a struck like a ton of it stroke you -- strike you. You know, we knew, we -- I saw it\n-- we escaped from -- from the execution of my town, I escaped. So I knew already it was --\nit was whatever it was. But in the big cities, with million of people -- with millions of\npeople, to build factories and to massacre those people -- and half he did clandestine and\nhalf he did -- he did you know it, for the -- for the not to arouse any suspicion, like in -- in\nTreblinka the same thing, they said airplanes were not allowed to -- to -- to go over\nTreblinka, because they didn\u2019t wanted to find out the real -- the real thing, what\u2019s going on\ndown there. Because it was 1n a wooded area, the crematorium and all and the things. And\nsome people say some of the local people used to stand and ask the -- the Jewish people,\ngive us your belonging, they are going to kill you anyway. Give us -- give us, we need it.\nYou don\u2019t need it any more. And this was sad and this was very hard to digest. So --and PI\n-- and Ill repeat what a survivor said, Lowrate, Elie Wiesel, by the opening of the museum.\nHe said, \u201cHow come that the silence of man was matched by the silence of God?\u201d And\nstarting from Moscow, Lisbon, London, Washington, they all knew what was going on,\nexcept the victims didn\u2019t know. How they could permit this and why the railroads were not\nbombed. And this is a question. And a answer we must find, each one in us.",
        "Q: Tell me how you were reunited with your sister.",
        "A: I came from the partisans and I came straight to my town, to Sarnee. And of course I find\nmy sister in the house of those people who they were our friends. In the house -- the first\npeople where I left when I ran out and I ran to their house, they took her 1n and they just --\nthe -- the -- the sad part of it, they made a maid out of her, instead of accepting her like a\npart of the family, they made a maid out of her, like they would exploitate the situation\nbecause she was a orphan and she didn\u2019t had nobody. And when I came down there, they\neven -- they -- they -- they -- the big lore, they were sitting in the dining room and my sister\nwas sitting in the kitchen like a -- like a little servant and a orphan. And that\u2019s what struck\nme and I told them. Very -- I was very, very touched -- very, very hurt. And they were our\nfriends. And so anyway, what the -- the main -- the main thing, she survived. And it\u2019s sels --\nor it\u2019s her story to tell how did she. She was -- she was plenty times almost killed by the\nnational Ukrainians. At one point she escaped from that woman, because they were after her\nto kill her. And somebody tipped her off and she ran a -- she ran away from -- from that\nhouse and they -- and -- and she survived. So it was one -- one miracle, I don\u2019t know. I\ndon\u2019t believe in miracles, but somehow. I guess miracle a people are making, miracles\nhappen. That\u2019s how I find my sister afte-after I came from the war. At this -- at those people\nwho were our friends. And there were -- I said, I was very hurt by that. It\u2019s not a easy task\nthat I\u2019m doing now, but I wanted -- I don\u2019t call the museum a museum, I call it a learning\ncenter. I call it -- it\u2019s all human beings. And it\u2019s not a Jewish problem, it\u2019s a human problem.\nI feel on that we will -- or we will live in peace or we\u2019ll perish like fools. It\u2019s a big liga said\nSO.",
        "Q: Do you remember the moment you were reunited with Simma?",
        "A: Yeah. We already, you know, we already trials and tribulation went through. She went\none way and she was, you know, harassed by the shepherds, by the Ukrainian. You know h-\nhow, you know, people can take advantage if they know you don\u2019t have nobody, no\nprotection or nothing. They used to harass her, they used to call her names and all kind of\nthing. But this is all things, you know, you can live with, but she lived through and that\u2019s\nthe main thing. And she has her own story to tell. She was in the orphanage. She -- I put her\nto school, right when we came out from the woods, she went to school. I did not proceeded,\nI wanted to proceed in school, but I never proceeded.",
        "Q: Did Sarnee look very different than it had looked before the war?",
        "A: Absolutely. It was bombed. It was destroyed a half. There were holes sinking because\nthat\u2019s a very strategic point, was Sarnee. There was this railroad, what a lody trains used to\ncome. It was Laviastand, it\u2019s a central station. But from all parts of the thing used to come,\nfrom Kiev, from this all and were -- somehow they were -- they were -- they were cross --\ncriss-cross down there in Sarnee. And -- and the fights were very fierce right around Sarnee.\nThere were some of our people who survived --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side A",

        "A: A mess. And it was -- it looked like a city deserted. Not the same people. It used to be\nalways a lot of fun to got out in the street and see people strolling, going -- going about their\nbusiness, going home, coming from home, young people -- young. And this was like -- like\n-- like not the same. A lot of the homes were destroyed, not kept right and -- and a lot of the\nbombs destroyed -- a lot of the bombs destroyed because it was a strategic point, like I\nexplained to you. And so it was not the same. It was a sad city. And --",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: This was in 1945 -- in 1945, almost the end in June, that\u2019s almost the end.",

        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019m just wondering if you remember the -- if the war was still going on or --",
        "A: Yeah, the war was still -- I don\u2019t think Berlin -- I don\u2019t remember exactly the dates. No, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly the dates that\u2019s this is -- and it was not of important at that time.",
        "Q: But it was -- it was close to that time?",
        "A: It was close, yeah -- yeah. Because they are advancing, we knew they are already -- they\nare dead. But -- because they -- they had to still to clean out some pockets of Germans, who\nthese are -- still were fighting with these up til the end. But we knew that\u2019s the end, that\u2019s it.\nGermany is -- 1s under.",
        "Q: Did you meet with people you knew in Sarnee, people you had known before the war?",
        "A: I was with them in the woods, but then some of them -- you see when the Soviets --\nwhen the Soviets start retreating, a lot the people went along with them, because they heard\nsome of them, they were scared and they would have just -- they be behind the German --\nthat they went with them. They retreated and then they came back after the war ended. They\ncame back, they thought they\u2019ll find some of the family, some of the thing, they didn\u2019t. So\nsome of the people returned back to -- to Sarnee. Very few I knew. And the funny part -- I\ndon\u2019t know if I said in the -- in the original -- when the Soviets came, they start also\narresting people and taking them to Siberia. At this was -- I\u2019m talking about 1939, when\nthey marched in -- into our country. And there were Capitalists they arrested, umtee,\nCommunists, whatever -- any, any -- some slogan, whatever they can atthat. They were\narresting them and calling them yenna -- yenna joshnie element. It\u2019s mean untrustworthy --\nunfor --trustworthy people. And -- and they took him away to Siberia. The tragedy was so\nterrible, everybody -- they thought that\u2019s the end of those people. Everybody cried, it was\nterrible. Little did we knew that their fate was not sealed. A lot of them died of s -- maybe\ndown there of heavy -- of hard work -- of the climate, malnutrition, whatever it is. But the\nbulk of them survived. We the lucky ones, we all perished, except the exception, including\nme. But I sur -- I -- I escaped by a miracle or whatever. And the bullet didn\u2019t strike me,\nthat\u2019s all -- plain as it 1s.",
        "Q: How was your health at that point? Had you gotten enough to eat through the war? Did\nyou feel -- were you fairly strong?",
        "A: When I was escaped, I was among the -- the peasants. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t miss any and\nexcept salt, I didn\u2019t miss any, you know, it was nothing gourmet food, but potatoes and\nwhatever, not -- it was -- it was enough to eat and enough to survive. Potatoes and a piece of\nbread and -- except salt was scarce. I used to sometimes beg the peasant for a little salt,\nbecause without this I think the feet start falling on -- there\u2019s something -- it\u2019s something not\n-- not -- thing happening. But otherwise -- otherwise it was okay. Not exactly we\u2019re\nstarving. In the ghetto was more harsh than after I escaped. If not I used to go and get\nmyself potatoes in the field and -- and bring in the woods -- get myself, help myself. And\nget in the fields and -- and whatever -- whose field it was I didn\u2019t care. A few potatoes it\nwouldn\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t bother nobody. So that\u2019s was the situation during -- during my escape.",
        "Q: Were y-you -- did you feel any hope at that point? The war is over and -- and maybe it\u2019s\n-- maybe there was a feeling that it\u2019s time to start a new life or -- but at the same time,\nyou \u2019ve got this burden of knowing what had happened to your family and to your people.\nWhat was your -- m -- can you describe your emotions?",
        "A: I had -- I-I had -- I was very sad, I didn\u2019t know, I was trying de -- ge -- where, but my --\nmy first thought was to go to Palestine on that time. And then I joined a group, a kibbutz,\nyou know and to go to a kibbutz and to go to Palestine. But then of course the plans\nchanged. My husband was a fighter, I was a fighter and we were plain -- were tired of\nfighting and I knew I have to start all over again coming to the -- to Palestine on that time.\nThey were -- they were fighting for their independent. And I said, \u201cI'll -- Pll need a rest,\u201d I\nneeded to go to the United States. And of course, I\u2019m not regretting, not at all. I love this\ncountry.",
        "Q: How did you -- I-let\u2019s find out -- you -- you\u2019re in Sarnee and you are still with your\nsister. Y -- I think you mentioned in the first interview that you met up with some members\nof your family who had survived. How did you decide what to do next?",
        "A: Some members of my fam -- my uncle came in of course, to Sarnee, then my cousin and\nthen we left the Soviet Union and we went -- we left the Soviet actually and anybody who\nwas a citizen of Poland, had the right to leave the Soviet Union -- Russia at that time and to\nemigrated to Poland. My intention was that I\u2019Il go on the western side, on the American\nside, on the English side and from there I can go better than while being in the Soviet Union\nbecause it was a dic -- a dictatorship. And I -- Zionism was taboo. Zionism was taboo, you\ncould not even mention the word Zionism, because this is nationalism and this is already has\na con-connotation with you know, the -- so it was taboo at that time. So I wanted to go into\nthe western side and from there I would go to Palestine. Of course the struggle in Palestine,\nwe know it. So we decided -- my aunt send us an affidavit. I had an aunt here in\nWashington, who was my mother\u2019s sister, who left Russia that time. We are talking about --\nI don\u2019t remember what she said, 1914, 19 -- way, way before the war or before the -- the\nrevolution was. She left and she came to the States. So I knew we had a -- we had a -- I have\nan aunt down here, my mother\u2019s sister. And the funny part, the way I found her. I ask my\nuncle, because I didn\u2019t know -- I know that someplace I had a aunt, my grandmother -- my\nBubba, I used to call her -- used to show pictures and used to kiss -- \u201cThese are my\ngrandchildren from the United States,\u201d and all kind of stuff like that. So I knew they had --\nthey had these and these names and they were living someplace in Detroit, so I asked my\nuncle where did my aunt lived, what city? He said, \u201cIn Detroit, Michigan.\u201d He remembered\nthat. So I went -- so how do you find in Detroit, Michigan? I didn\u2019t know the language, I\ndidn\u2019t know. But there was a student, a Jewish student who took English and he was -- and\nhe knew English and I went up to him and I told him my story and I tell, \u201cHow do I find my\n-- my -- my relatives? This and that much I know.\u201d He said, \u201cLet me try something.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cIll pay you for it, if you find them.\u201d He sent into the police department in Detroit,\nMichigan, a letter that said these and these people are looking f -- they are sur -- they\nsurvived the war and they are looking for their relatives in the States and within a week or\ntwo weeks, I received a -- a response, they are not in Detroit, Michigan, but they are in\nWashington.",
        "Q: Wh -- You sent this letter from -- from where? From --",
        "A: From Poland, Beetun. Beetun --",
        "Q: Is this after you had left Sarnee?",
        "A: After I have left Sarnee, yeah. After I have left Sarnee, I came on the western side and\nthis -- we had there -- this is also another story, the way we had to go through the\nmountains. We had to leave Russia not -- not legally, it was half legal. We had to leave\nthrough -- cross the borders and come on the western side because they would right away,\nthey would arrest you -- they would whatever. But there was already a movement start\ngoing because we survivors didn\u2019t wanted to go on the bloody earth any more and we\ndecided to go up to the west. To the west I mean England, the States and whatever not. So\nwe left, we actually went through the border, the Czechoslovakian -- the Czechoslovakian\nbor -- the -- the -- on the border police, they were very sympathetic to us. They didn\u2019t ask us\ntoo many questions either. We tell them we are ref -- we are political refugees and that\u2019s it,\nthey knew it.",
        "Q: So th-th -- you had to -- the difficult crossing was from Sarnee, the eastern part of Poland\nto the western part?",
        "A: We [indecipherable] yeah. But I -- no, we had -- we -- we made our papers -- you know,\n[ -- as a -- as a -- aS a Polish citizen up til 1939, had the right to go up to -- to leave the\nSoviet Union and to go on the western side. So I made out my paper with a shalone of the\nlody -- a lot of people who left Poland, I went on the Polish side, because Poland was -- at\nthat time a half of Poland was -- the Germans divided. They gave it back to the Soviets and\na piece of Germany, they gave it to the Poles. The geography changed at that time. You\nfollow me? Yeah. So the geography changed. So my part remained in the Soviet Union, but\nI had the right to leave the Soviet Union because I was a citizen of Poland, I was a Pole by\nnationality. And to go on the western side. So I wind up in Beetun -- in Poland, Beetun and\nfrom --",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: I -- we went down there, we had -- we went -- we went -- just we settled down there,\nbecause I don\u2019t know how did that happen. My uncle was down there, he settled down there\nand I went down there, my cousin and we stayed in Beetun.",
        "Q: And your sister too, was she with you?",
        "A: And -- and my sister -- my sister happened like this. She was in Poland, in an orphanage\nhome, because I couldn\u2019t keep her with me. I was myself doing things, I had to make, you\nknow, just to feed myself, I had the -- the -- you know ways to sell, buy, whatever I could\njust to make some food. So my sister, it was no future. I had -- my sister had to go to school\nat that time. So I gave her -- she went -- I put her in a orphanage home with a lot the other\nfrom different cities. And I remember it was in Ludwigsdorf, I think, Ludwigsdorf, on the\nPolish side. It was right on the -- on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. And\nshe stayed down there and I used to visit her every week. And all of a sudden, I come one\nweek, my sister is not there. They said it is mun, they don\u2019t have the kibbutz any more and I\nask how and w-why and they told me they -- they went over on the other side. And I knew\nexactly what they were talking about. They went over the border, they went via -- th-\nthrough Czechoslovakia and they went on the American zone. So I lost my sister at that\ntime. I went to Poland. My sister, with the -- with the all group of kids, wind up on the\nexodus, going to Palestine at that time. And then they turned them back, back to Hamburg,\nthey disembarked them, there when I met my sister and I brought her to Italy. I came -- I\ncame from Italy to meet her. It\u2019s a little complicated, but that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: Okay -- okay, so let me make sure I have this straight. You were in western Poland, in\nBeetun -- Beetun?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And your sister ha -- w-was she with you at that time when you were in Beetun or had\nshe already --",

        "A: An hour, an hour and something.",
        "Q: How long did you remain in Beetun?",
        "A: Not too long, I don\u2019t know approximate, months, that\u2019s all. Til the start of the movement\nand we wanted to go on the western side, to leave Poland, to get out of there.",

        "A: I had in mind to go to Palestine on that time.",
        "Q: And did your si -- had your sister want to go there?",
        "A: And my sister, I lost contact with her, because she completely went in another direction,\nI was asking around, asking here, asking there. It was, you know -- it was still all mish --\nmish-mash, it was all -- all -- all things. And then eventually I find out that she was on the\nexodus. At that time we didn\u2019t know exodus will get so famous. On the exodus -- on the\nexodus boat, the -- the ship, they brought them to Haifa, they brought them to Cyprus and\nthen they brought them to Marseilles. They disembarked them in -- near Hamburg, there I\ndecided -- I find out everything in the thier, I decided I'll make a passport, I'll go and I\u2019Il get\nmy sister and I\u2019ll bring her to Italy. And that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: Had you been hearing about the story of the exodus in the news as it was happening that\ntime?",
        "A: We knew about it. I knew it -- I knew it, I don\u2019t think about the other people, but I knew\nit because my sister was on it. I didn\u2019t know about the other people. I guess we -- 1t was\nnews at that time. They were brought into Hamburg and I remember there are frogmen\nactually went under it and they told the English that we are going to go to pieces to get\nevery the -- with the ship, if you will not. And they were afraid at that time for public\nopinion and they let it go and they made a deal at that time I think, with the Hagannah, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly the deal they made with the Hagannah, so the people, they -- they ask\nthe people to disembark and they put them in a camp in -- near Hamburg. Near Hamburg.\nAnd I went all across Germany, I went to Hamburg, picked up my sister and it was another\nstory by itself, so this will not go in. But this is the main thing, I picked up my sister and I\nbrought her to Italy and from Italy she came to the States, we came afterwards.",
        "Q: I want to hear, still 1n -- about the details of your -- how you -- how you -- what you tra --\nhow you traveled from -- from Poland and what you did and I know you were 1n a displaced\npersons camp in Germany and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so let\u2019s get that era in between Italy and Poland, after the war.",
        "A: Between Italy, between Poland and Italy --",
        "Q: Between Poland and Italy.",
        "A: Poland we left one night, we knew it, we have to leave. We\u2019re -- there was the Hagannah\nthat time was working that\u2019s aleah bet, if you know what I\u2019m talking about. Aleah bet and\nall those thing, they were working together with us and we wanted to leave, that\u2019s it -- it\u2019s\nenough. The -- the earth was bloody, it didn\u2019t felt -- there -- no attachment, nothing. There\u2019s\nnothing down there but givas. So we decided to leave -- to leave again Poland and to come\non the western side. And on the western side, it\u2019s where we wind up in Beetun and -- and\nfrom Beetun, one day, they decided to close the Czechoslovakian border, was also\norganized. And they let us through, they were very, very friendly and very sympathetic,\nwhatever it was happening, they knew what we suffered and the Czechs were -- a lot of\npeople were very good people.",

And my uncle was present, he was -- I\nhave still some pictures, but 1t was not exactly a wedding, a wedding because all from the\ncamp participated in that wedding.

        "A: All the devastation -- I never gave up hoped, for some reason. My positive outlook\ntowards life, it\u2019s funny. And I never thought that\u2019s all the people are evil. I never lost that\ntorch. And I s -- and I saw because the people actually were -- mostly attributed my crave to\nthe Seven Day Adventists in my -- in my -- in my personal experience.

        "A: Very.",
        "Q: Were you ab -- able to even imagine forgiving at that time?",
        "A: Not at that time. Little by little, I see that you cannot leave -- that\u2019s -- you have to --\nthat\u2019s the world we live in. But we must learn what the yesterday was. Live today and see\nthat tomorrow will be a secure one. And that\u2019s what -- 1t\u2019s a big responsibility the survivors\nhave. It\u2019s not to -- to tell everybody a horror story, but to learn what people are capable of\ndoing things and there were people with faces with two eyes in them and they were capable\nof doing those horrible things. And then coming back to their families. How could they do\nthis, I don\u2019t know. And be loving parents, I don\u2019t [inaudible] how. Maybe they have their\nproblems.",

        "A: Yeah, I came out -- yes, I met him and I introduced -- introduced ourselves, I told him\nthat -- and he went to the swimming pool and he asked me also to come. I said, \u201cOh, I will\ncome.\u201d I came to the swimming pool and there was no -- nothing to sit on and I said, \u201cNo, I\nma -- don\u2019t have my -- I don\u2019t have swimming trunk -- I don\u2019t have no -- on the swim --\nswimming suit. I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m not going to sit here.\u201d So while he went for his -- down there\nto put something to sit down and to -- and to join the -- the crowd down, I had some things\nto do and I left. But then we met again and somehow it started with our courting and then\nwe got married within -- within months. I don\u2019t remember how long we went out, about\nthree or four months.",
        "Q: Did you tell each other about your experiences during the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah, definitely. We knew what was -- our experience was known to each other,\ndefinitely. He was also in the underground, but his fight was a little different than mine, but\nwe knew definitely what each other had did. So --",
        "Q: So di -- [\u2019m -- I\u2019m just interested 1n -- in --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Getting a sense of how you -- how you really felt about the -- about your life at that time.\nYou -- you meet your husband, you fall in love but is -- was there the -- I mean, w-we\nassociate feelings of lightheartedness with falling in love or w -- or feelings of sort of being\ndizzy or young, but did you feel like a young woman just falling in love for the first time or\ndid it feel -- were you more -- were you --",
        "A: I\u2019m more [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Grieving or was it sad? Did you feel -- was it difficult?",
        "A: Not sadn -- sadness was with us. It was a normal -- a normal every day -- the sadness was\nthere. But we were young and I -- I had hopes for the -- for the future, I had hopes. If --\notherwise, it would be disastrous. I had hopes. And I was mostly a positive thinker.",
        "Q: What were your hopes and dreams at that time?",
        "A: I want to have a home, a nice family and I had children too. I had our little problems here\nand there, like normal. But I had this beautiful family, we have three kids and each -- I\u2019m\nproud of each one in his own way. They understand. I respect them, they respect us, so --\nit\u2019s looks like -- it\u2019s al-also an achievement, I[ -- I think so. I taught them the right way,\nwhat\u2019s right, what\u2019s wrong. And I explained to them what hate, they know exactly what hate\ncan do, how dangerous hate can be. And this, we must start it when they\u2019re young, to teach\nthem. And so they -- so this is -- this is I think 1t\u2019s my achievement -- it\u2019s our, my husband\nand I.",
        "Q: Did you always make a point of talking to your children about the Holocaust? Did you\ntell them what was -- what your history was?",
        "A: I spoke -- it was -- yeah, they know it. My son -- let\u2019s see, I spoke once, he didn\u2019t hear\nexactly, but I spoke and I explained the tales. I went through how and our little grandson,\nwho\u2019s 10, he was nine at the time, after I talk -- and I did not even understood if this kid\nwould understand and I didn\u2019t -- I -- you understand, it\u2019s nine years old. But after I spoke,\nhe said, \u201cGrandma Boby, c -- would you speak to my school, come to my school and tell\nyour story?\u201d I said, \u201cIf your teacher will invite me, Pll come.\u201d [inaudible] tell him, you\nunderstand? So I made something -- in -- impression or something on he may understand.\nHe said, \u201cI know you fought the Germans.\u201d And this is -- I wanted my kids to know that I\nwas not sitting idly and was waiting to be killed. I went out to fight and there were many\nJewish boys and girls who did it. Actually I was the first one in Washington who spoke\nabout it. The first -- the first about the partisans, about the fighters. And I know girls who\nnever lived to see the day of liberation. They died fighting. I was the lucky one to tell my\nstory. And there were one on top of the other, I know, but every day was a constant -- a\nconstant moving, a constant going, a constant doing something. Or we were ambush them,\nthey ambushed us. And it\u2019s a constant or we be there on their back, constant. And you were\ntired. You were tired very much. I remember almost I -- I paid with my life. I came four\no\u2019clock, my worst time, my worst time of the day is -- 1s daybreak, between like four or\nthree o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock at night til -- til six, three til six. We came to a certain\ndestination and -- and I felt -- my commanding officer came up and he said I have to stand\non -- on patrol. And I begged him -- we were -- we were -- we were traveling on horses,\nthey\u2019re almost old than I. I begged him, Ill give you two times, I\u2019ll give you four hours\nlater, but let me rest. I know my weakness. He insisted, I don\u2019t know what was the reason, I\nhad -- I went down there and actually I didn\u2019t fell asleep, but actually I -- I dozed off. And\nthere were -- the guy who was -- was checking on the sentries, he grabbed on my -- on my --\non my gun -- he -- he -- he grabbed the gun and you know, he had the right to kill me right\nthere and then because this is -- this is a war, it\u2019s not -- 1t\u2019s not no -- no nonsense. And the\nnext day I was called to the headquarters and I thought that they\u2019re going to put me at firing\nsquad. I came -- I -- I was a little bit, you know, inside -- a little bit afraid, I don\u2019t know, you\nknow. I said, you know, they\u2019ll put me as a example. But somehow they gave me a warning\nthat time. And I know I\u2019Il been watched and after a month or so, they already praised me\nthere. I done good and they said they -- but this happened.",
        "Q: So there was a certain amount of -- you also described in the first interview that -- that\nthere were instances of torture, that the partisans occasionally were involved in torturing and\nthat you had said you don\u2019t want to be involved in something like that.",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable].",
        "Q: And -- and -- and you just mentioned now that, you know, you weren\u2019t sure that you\nwere completely safe. So the partisans were not -- I mean, if we romanticized the situation,\nwe might think --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Brenda Senders. This is tape three, side B.\nOkay, so my question is that -- I think the picture that you\u2019re painting of life with this\npartisan group, 1s very complex. It doesn\u2019t seem that -- that, I mean you -- you couldn\u2019t be\nsure that if you didn\u2019t -- if you made a mistake you would be beyond being punished and if -\n- if an enemy were captured, it wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t just a matter of killing the enemy right\naway, sometimes those enemies were tortured and you were witnessing human suffering on\nthe other side as well. How did that make you feel?",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t, that\u2019s what I, you know the -- this -- some of the guys, you know, they were\n-- they were -- they\u2019re very bitter, you know. They expressed it more. And they -- they got a\nhold of any of the enemy on the other side and -- he was a big shot. He was one of the\nengineers who build the pantom planes -- the pantom bridges, what they -- you -- during the\nwar the -- the -- the -- the tanks are going over and the -- the tanks. You know the -- fast --\nyou have to come to a -- to a river and you have to build them right there and then. And he\nfell in-into our hands with his chauffeur, with his car, with all those things. And decide to\nhave -- I -- I said I\u2019m not for it -- kill him and over with. And I remember I saw him face to\nface. He said he had a child. I said, \u201cI had a mother an-and a father too. And I had a brother\nand a sister.\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd I had a grandfather and a grandmother.\u201d But they -- I don\u2019t\nknow. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my game, I\u2019m not involved 1n it.\u201d I said, \u201cKill him and over with.\u201d",
        "Q: Were there other instances of torture among the group?",
        "A: Not necessary, no. No.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: No, because -- because he was a bigshot, because he was a important man, I don\u2019t know,\nthis 1s something I don\u2019t know. It came to me and I -- I -- I -- I said no. I said, \u201cYou know,\nhe\u2019s a enemy, we don\u2019t have no place to keep him as a thing, just --.\u201d\u2019 But some guys say I\ncannot, you understand? You can not be responsible, but, you know, that\u2019s the way it\nhappened on that time. We didn\u2019t have no prisoners of war, we didn\u2019t have no prison camps,\nwe didn\u2019t have no places to keep him. I remember from Moscow, a student, a -- a medical\nstudent came to us, they dropped him -- parachuted him into our midst. And I don\u2019t know\nwhat they told him in Moscow, I don\u2019t know what they told him. So when he -- when he\ncame to our midst and he was walking with me -- next to me, he asked, \u201cWhere 1s the\nsecond -- where is the next hospital we are taking all our wounded?\u201d So we start laughing.\nYou understand, it was a joke for us all. You know, we are already the veterans, the old\npeople who went on there for -- for a few years, or this. A hospital, I said, \u201cYou see this b --\nhorse and buggy? This is our hospitals. And this is our surgeon and this is assistant, we are\ndoing it right here -- in here, we\u2019re in -- the -- right here, in the open field.\u201d And it was cold,\nwe used to make a bonfire if it\u2019s -- we could. And a -- many times -- many -- sometimes we\nwere not allowed, because the enemy would sniff us out -- would find us out, where we are.\nAnd we were a might -- 1500 to 1600 people, full equipped. But this big -- a big unit, a lot\nof thing. And I think the partisan fought -- I think very gallantly and I think I\u2019m proud to be\na part of this movement at that time, with no reservation.",
        "Q: Does it make you angry when you hear people say that the Jews went like lambs to the\nslaughter?",
        "A: Maybe some did. Like in any people. I would ask them how many countries resisted the\nGermans. The Jews were not ready. They were civilians. This was a government. A\ngovernment with all the institution, with all the propagandas, with all their might, was --\nwere planning a execution of a people. And they have the surroundings. They already\nprepared the hostile surroundings. They made them Fascist, them made them national\nwhatever they call themselves. And they helped them out in this -- in this horrible task, to\nmurder and some of them their own citizen, their own friends. And then the Germans saw\nwhat they are doing, that they use for instance, people from my town -- if he become -- if he\nbecame a Fascist, they would take him and take him to another city and from the other city,\nbring him in my city, there should be no -- no personal connection, you understand? There\nshould be no -- no -- that\u2019s how he could do his -- his -- his -- his dirty job, his -- his terrible\nthing. Does it make sense?",
        "Q: We were talking a little while ago and I want to get back to where you -- you were -- a-\nafter the war had ended and you were in Germany at this displaced person\u2019s camp, you met\nyour m -- husband, you had gotten married. A little before that you had mentioned that you\nhad been trying to get in touch with your aunt in Detroit.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And that was while you were still in Poland. What happened? Did you get in touch with\nher by the time you had gotten to Germany?",
        "A: Oh yes, I got -- y-y-yes, yes, I got back a response that she moved from Detroit,\nMichigan, came to Washington with her address. And then my uncle, you know, was her\nbrother, start corresponding with her. And then we followed. We -- she send us affidavit and\nhow -- that how we came, in 1951, in the end of 1951, all -- almost Christmastime, we were\non this sh-ship, on the Constitution, coming to the United States. On the 100,000 refugees,\nwhat Truman at that time, allowed to come to the States, we came on this -- on this quota.\nPlus affidavit my aunt send me and that\u2019s what we wind up to be in Washington.",
        "Q: Okay, before you tell about that, tell me about how you -- you made the decision to go\nfrom Germany to Italy and when that happened and who was with you?",
        "A: From Germany to Italy, my -- my husband had some kind assignment to work some --\nsomethings -- to help out with some kind of -- some kind of job. So we decided to go to\nItaly and that\u2019s what the decision was made there and there and we left -- and this was like a\ntransit, like Austria, Italy and then we\u2019ll go to Palestine. Then, being in Italy, we changed\nour mind and we said, \u201cWe are tired of fighting, we\u2019ll go to the States and if we don\u2019t like it,\nthen --.\u201d",

        "A: To Italy he had to go, yeah. To Italy and anyway it was our way of going there anyway\nand he was send there, so it -- both things match together and we were -- and we -- and we\ncame down there. You know also, the day when we got married, yes, I forgot to mention, he\ngot a telegram that his sister survived from a concentration camp and she lives in Italy. So\nall together, like camil -- like kenna -- like all together. And right after we got married, we\nwent to Italy, we met his sister and from there of course -- then afterwards we came to the\nStates. And some people went to Palestine. Legally, illegally, illegal, whatever it was at that\ntime. If you know from exodus, you know it.",
        "Q: What w -- y -- what was the name of the organization that your husband was working\nfor?",

        "A: Oh, it was a -- a wedding, you know, it\u2019s like the whole camp participated and it was like\na -- a big -- a big excitement for everybody here, we got married. First of all I didn\u2019t want tt,\nI said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll go to Italy and down there we\u2019ll see what\u2019s what,\u201d but my uncle\ninsisted -- my uncle insisted, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have nobody, he doesn\u2019t have nobody, why --\nmake it legal.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s make it legal.\u201d You know, I was reluctant, yes,\nmarriage, you know, we go over the borders and all those thing. So we decided to get\nmarried and it was a big excitement, we were the only one, bride and groom, to get married\nand this and that. So it was the excitement of the whole -- of the whole camp. Like they --\nthey -- one woman baked a cake, the other one it was -- they brought a dean in the kibbutz.\nIn the kibbutz was the -- the -- the wedding. We had the -- we had attendant -- attendant\nwith two rabbis. Rabbis were attending our wedding. So it was -- it was interesting. I -- I felt\na little bit jitter I remember, it was so funny, it\u2019s like a commitment, it\u2019s like something, you\nknow. But y-you know, it was -- it was okay, it was a lot of excitement at that time.",

But they were also -- they were something -- they were in the camp. One is a\nHungarian I think and one Czechoslovakian or so. So we had two rabbis to our wedding. I\nhave some pictures someplace, I -- I did not refer them -- I don\u2019t -- not thinking about tt.\nThey are in black and white. Yes, I think this should be sufficient, whatever -- how they\u2019re\ninterested.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I\u2019m th -- also curious about --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And -- was it -- was it well organized, did you think?",
        "A: It was organized, I don\u2019t know well. Of course, for improvement it\u2019s always. But it\u2019s was\norganized and each -- let\u2019s say there were a few kibbutzim, a few groups, what they -- each\none cared for them, you know, there were separate entities, like. And I would say they were\nwell organized and we u -- we used to get some kind of provision, I don\u2019t know how, from\nthe highers, from the joint distribution committee. I don\u2019t know exactly. But we used to get\nsome provisions somep -- some -- some breve -- some ri -- assigned to us. I don\u2019t remember\nexactly. My uncle, I think used to get it. We used to be all involved.",

        "A: Not exactly, not -- not exactly free and go, we had to have a little thing to go out from\nthe camp to stroll around. For instance, once I was arrested by the MP. I was going out.\nMaybe they liked the MP\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, we were young girls and they were young boys.\nYou know, it\u2019s something that they do -- they stopped us and you know, what -- they let us,\nyou know. But it was funny, because we were not allowed perfaca to go down there, we had\nto have a permission or something. But we used to go out. It was not so bad. We used to go\nout and we used to s -- to -- to, but one occasion it was that way. We were arrested by the\nMP, but this is -- was -- maybe, I don\u2019t know, we were young girls and they were young\nboys, so, you know.",
        "Q: It was because you\u2019d gone out without a pass, is that why?",
        "A: I think without a pass, or something. They were asking us for a pass and I said and we\ndon\u2019t have it and all kind of things. So that\u2019s, I --",
        "Q: What did they do to you?",
        "A: No, nothing. They said they\u2019 Il arrest us and -- but it\u2019s -- nothing happened. No, it was a\nlittle bit of excitement 1n the -- in the town down there and I think we needed some kind of -\n- if we go to the city, I -- but I don\u2019t remember. But people used to move around, we used to\ngo, we used to even go up to Lind\u2019s, we used to go there and here with thems -- we\u2019re some\n-- I don\u2019t remember this is exactly, the restrictions had a ba -- but we used to move, we used\nto go up to Lind\u2019s and there and here and somehow we used to find our way, how to go\nabout. And so this --",
        "Q: Do you remember dealing with a civilian, Austrian population, non-Jews after -- after the\nwar while you were there and were there any incidents?",
        "A: Yeah, because they\u2019re all, you know the tone was already different, you know. He said --\nthey were ti -- for instance, the town where he was born, they said he was a nasty and he\nwas a bad guy when he was young, but you know during his last time, maybe they talked,\nthey -- they spoke differently about him, you understand? But in our time he came down\nthere, listen the shoemaker, this one, I used to take my shoes, he used to say he was nasty,\nhe was -- he was beating up everybody and this and that. But we had connection, yes,\ndefinitely, with the Austrian. Not go bosom buddies, you know, we were separate from\nthem.",
        "Q: Did you feel resentment in any way towards the Austrians?",
        "A: I felt a resentment to all those things when it happened, but not in a personal, you know,\nwhen you meet a person, the person, then they meet you. Of course when you find out he\nwas a Nazi or involved with the thing, you right away felt a revolt too much then. Felt a\nresentment, felt a fimkanee -- finekinay you understand? Because I knew what they -- what\nthey were all -- what they were all about, what their aim was.",
        "Q: So you did meet -- you actually met people who had been Nazis?",
        "A: Not -- they would not tell me. If they were, they would not tell me. Sometimes they\nwould say a word here and there, I used to make a puzzle and find out that\u2019s they were\ninvolved somewhat with the Nazis. I already had my way. I knew that they were something\ninvolved with them. They were -- later on they knew it was not a big honor, to be from the\nHitler youth, or from the Nazi movement. And I don\u2019t know how many Germans -- a lot of\nGermans knew what was going on. But the propaganda was so harsh and they -- about the\nJews, they portrayed the Jews with the -- with the -- with the noses, with the things. Hitler\nhimself, if he take off his hair, he looked more like a caricature he would make of the Jews,\nhe would be one. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s another thing. But put him in -- in the uniform of our\nconcentration camp, let\u2019s see how he\u2019d lever look. And if he would be alive out there, they\nput him -- well they put him in -- in a cage. To look at the specimen.",
        "Q: Tell me about your time in Italy and what you -- you -- you spent f -- about five years\nthere?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Ta -- Tell me about what you were doing.",
        "A: I love the Italian people. In the beginning I felt a funny feeling about Fascism and\nMussolini, but after I -- I find out he was also -- he was also like a victim, he went with H1-\nHitler and then he was in his game already. He -- with all this -- like he blackmailed him\nintel -- in a lot of things, because Mussolini was in the begin -- after we met the Italian\npeople, I -- I didn\u2019t feel bad about it, because we knew that they tricked him in, also -- in a\nlot of ca -- of cases and a lot of ways. And with this patachi, whatever he was involved 1n,\nit\u2019s, you know -- all sorts -- 1t\u2019s a work of the -- I think of the Nazis, of the Germans, they\npushed on him. And so I didn\u2019t felt resentment. I liked my -- my neighbors. I became even\nvery friendly with them. Our daughter was born -- re-really was born in Italy, she had\nfriend, a friend next door, used to go out. They were very nice and very interesting people.\nMost of them liked opera, like singing, you know, they used to sing arias in the -- a bu -- a\nguy on a bicycle used to go -- ride on the bicycle and sing arias from the opera. And it was -\n- it was a nice -- a nice time spend in Italy. I have good memories, very good memories.",
        "Q: Wh-Where were you living?",
        "A: In Milano, mm-hm. And there were some -- a concentration of Jewish people down there\nand til the time came we get our visa and in 19 -- in the end, almost -- almost our visa went\nout on the international border. So we were coming to the States, you understand, just\nalmost like to the day we were living Italy and coming -- and coming to the United States.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s -- did you speak English at the time?",
        "A: Not at all. And I -- it was so difficult for me, I remember Christmas, I could not even\npronounce it. It was Christmastime and -- and my Rita spoke Italian very well and she met\nanother Italian lit-little kid and they used to play together. And what worried me very much,\nI remember being on the Constitution, they told me in Italy that everything 1s -- is conser --\nconserved, everything is conserved there in the United -- everything comes in boxes and in -\n- in package. And I liked fresh foods. And -- and I said, God, she sa -- even chicken, you --\nyou get it in a -- you know, it\u2019s so all -- all -- all creative things for some people. And this --\nI met this Italian woman and start talking to her, she said, \u201cI knew -- I live in the United\nStates. You can get as much fresh food as you want to. Just if you wanted to do this, it\u2019s\nfine. Of course we have -- we have -- we have --.\u201d I was so happy, I remember. I just came\nrunning and I said, \u201cOh my God, look at that.\u201d It was a false -- a false information before.\nAnd so we came and I got very sick on the -- coming in here on the -- on the ship. I got\nseasick and I thought maybe I will never see the Statue of Liberty.",
        "Q: Did you study English at all while you were in Italy or did you come to the United States\nwithout learning any?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t - I wanted to go to berlitz, they have berlitz schools down there, where they\nteach English. And I started maybe one or two lessons and then, you know, you ge -- you\nget busy, whatever you are doing, with the kid I already had and whatever you are doing\nand I said, \u201cWhen I\u2019Il come to the States, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d And so we didn\u2019t. We did very limited -\n- we didn\u2019t know English at all. But little by little, somehow I can converse and I -- and I\u2019m\nfine. I read a li -- goo -- I read and I -- I-I\u2019m fine. I think so, at least.",
        "Q: Oh very, you\u2019re very fine. And -- okay, so you\u2019re -- you\u2019re on the -- the ship, coming to\nthe United States. You get --",
        "A: I wanted here in to go to school and yet I proceeded to go into college. That\u2019s, you know,\nmaybe I was not too ambitious about it, otherwise I would have done it. But I had the -- I\nwas trying [indecipherable] there, because I was a teacher, I taught in the camps. When I\nwas in the camps, I taught first graders and things and I loved children and children loved\nme very much, too.",
        "Q: Which camps?",
        "A: In -- in Italy, we were 1n a camp, Hadriatica, they call it. That\u2019s in the outskirts of Milan.",
        "Q: A displaced persons --",
        "A: That was a camp for -- displaced person camp, yeah. Oh, you forgot to mention this here.",
        "Q: Yeah. H -- Is that where you lived th-the entire time that you were in Italy?",
        "A: Not the entire. For a-awhile and then we went privately -- to live privately and from our\nprivate home, we came to the States. We left the camp. They disbanded the camp or they\nmoved the camp, I don\u2019t know exactly, but they disbanded the camp and a lot of people left\nfor Palestine, a lot of people left there, here and -- and -- and we went private and being\nprivate, we went -- we came to the States. But we were in that camp with a lot of more\nrefugees like ourselves.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re on the ship and you -- were you ill the entire trip?",
        "A: I was ill the entire trip. No, the -- not the entire -- up til we came to the Gabriel tart. The\nGabriel tart are the deep waters already, Africa and there -- down there in the -- on the horn.\nWhen we came down there, right away I got like somebody would -- there I got right away\nsick. I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t even go near the -- the -- the dining room, that\u2019s how darn sick I\nwas. And I thought, \u201cGod almighty, I will never see here, I went through all these things,\nthe war and everything, Ill never see.\u201d I was so sick to my stomach. When they told me the\nStatue of Liberty, I came out -- crawl out from down there, from the -- my cabin and I\nlooked and it was a sight to see, I remember. I remember it in the early morning, the Statue\nof Liberty, with the thing and it was -- 1t was very fine. Then we came to the harbor of New\nYork. There was a cousin of ours, were waiting for us. I expected my aunt to come from\nWashington, she didn\u2019t, but she gave some words to my -- our cousin in New York and she\nsent her son and he -- and he was waiting for us -- for our arrival. Then we -- when we\ncame, he greeted us, so it was -- 1t was a little bit -- it w -- you know, very -- it was pleasant\nfor us. And -- and I remember on a Sunday we arrived on the harbor and -- and New York.\nAnd then another one, she was a distant relative of some kind and she was married and she\ncame also to greet us. And something I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her, I don\u2019t know\nexactly, but something about. Whatever -- she was standing, I don\u2019t know, something I\ndidn\u2019t had a good feeling about her. And maybe I thought she did the -- looked down, I\ndon\u2019t know, something -- I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her. And then he took us to his\nhouse, this Dave, who came to -- to greet us on the thing. And when we came out from that -\n- from the harbor, I didn\u2019t like it. I said, \u201cThis is America? This is the United States?\u201d\nEverything -- you know Sunday, it was deserted and those big factories down there, right\ndown there in the -- it was something -- I did not, it made a funny impression on me.\nSomething -- I expected in my head the United States to be something, something. And here\nI see this empty and the big, big, huge, huge buildings. And then he took us to his house and\nwhen I walked in, it was like in the movies I see. It was as -- a small, little apart -- a nice\napartment. It was a two story, with -- with the steps going up and it was -- and I said to\nLeon, \u201cLookit, it\u2019s like in the movies we saw, American movies, it\u2019s like in the movies.\u201d\nAnd there was a television and -- and I remember and also this has struck me very funny at\nthat time. It was a Milton Berle show at that time, very, very, very, very popular, everybody\nwas watching, it was such an excitement like who knows what was going on. And I came\nthe first night -- instead of talking to us, she left us and she went to watch Milton Berle and -\n- and I felt so funny about it, because I said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen this -- in Europe, I\nwouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d But this is, you know, maybe it was no harm was done. You understand,\nbut I was so touched by every little thing that I -- I -- I -- I just felt 1t\u2019s, you know, it was not\nright. But this was the first impression about the United States. And they had their daughter\n-- and then I walked in and a -- and upstairs they had her bedroom and she had so many\nshoes and I ask her, \u201cWhy do you have so many shoes?\u201d It was everything something new\nfor me, something different, than I\u2019m used to down there. But anyway it was -- it was okay.\nI was a little bit angry at my aunt, she didn\u2019t come, but she was not a rich woman herself,\nshe was a hard working woman. So then -- and then when we came to the -- to Washington,\nI could understand. She couldn\u2019t leave at that time her husband or whatever. So we stayed. I\nhad a little bit also f-feelings about my cousins because maybe I expected from them more\nthan they could give me. You know, I was -- I was wounded, like a wounded animal and\nhere -- you understand, a little compassion, a little understanding, a little asking about their\nfamily. It\u2019s not you and us. It\u2019s not, yet -- it\u2019s the same.",
        "Q: You felt like they were trying to create a -- a division between --",
        "A: It\u2019s something like a division, like -- ignorant about that what was going on down there.\nIt\u2019s like they talk about -- they talked about Europe, let\u2019s say, there would be like it\u2019s\nanother planet. And this is something that struck me very un-understanding. They never --\nthey never asked me, you\u2019re some -- you know this is a little bit -- was, you know. But then\ntheir children were more -- were more sub-subseptive, more -- more understanding, more\nthink towards -- they used to ask me some question and some of them were vrot some and\nthey ask me some question about what happening in Europe. They were already start to\nbeing more aware of that. But their parents, no. Once in awhile we used to be invited, but\nnot -- but not close- close like. But that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t ask you about what had happened to you during the war?",
        "A: Very little. And I didn\u2019t volunteer to -- to -- to -- to push on them. The int -- didn\u2019t\nvolunteer and they didn\u2019t ask so I didn\u2019t tell them, you understand?",
        "Q: Was that difficult?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Not to talk to -- to people who were your family and -- about -- about this immense\ntragedy.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And I thought I singled them out, I thought maybe they are not aware,\nbecause I\u2019m -- okay, whatever -- I ne -- wanted to say. But that was hurting very much. Our\nchildren should have been more together with them. We used to get together, but not at real\nfamily, you know, because they were my immediate family, that\u2019s all that I had. And so this\nis -- this is the way the [indecipherable] remain on our own. We stood on our own two feet,\nwe made it. And made it pretty okay, made a nice living. We raised our kids, like I said, we\nare very proud of each one of them. One is in advertising, one is a free lance writer in Los\nAngeles and we have a son who is doing very well, he is a nice human being, that\u2019s the --\nvery important. Very sensitive and sensible person. And this is two important things 1n life.",
        "Q: Tell me the names of your children and when they were born.",
        "A: Rita. Rita was born in \u201849.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, Rita, my -- our oldest daughter was born in 1949, October the second. Sherry was\nborn June 12th, 1954 and Stanley was born August 29th, 1956.",
        "Q: And what are the -- why don\u2019t you go ahead and tell me the names of your -- of all your\ngrandchildren?",
        "A: I have Rochelle. Rochelle Leah. I have La-Laura Michelle, that\u2019s Sherry\u2019s daughter.\nThen I have Justin, who is our son\u2019s son and then I have two kids from my -- from our older\ndaughter, two grandchildren, Nick and Lucy Kate. They were adopted and they\u2019re adorable\nkids.",
        "Q: All right, great. Okay. So you -- you -- did you come to Washington right away after\narriving in New York?",
        "A: Yeah. After arriving in New York, we were down there for a week, rested up a little bit\nbecause I was very weak coming down from the ship and I was -- I was still going around\nlike being dizzy after I already came on the ground. So I was dizzy and I was -- I was weak.\nI didn\u2019t eat nothing. I had to come back to myself. And so for a -- a -- something like a\nweek, we stayed in New York with our relatives and -- and from New York, we came to\nWashington. And on the station -- on -- we came by train at that time I remember. On the\nstation we were greeted by my aunt, uncle and a cousin, a survivor, I remember, who came\nbefore I had afass, and my cousin who -- her grandparents I described down there when I\nleft them, right, in Sarnee, before I escaped from the -- from the execution, the Pomerantz\nfamily.",
        "Q: What did you do, how did you start out?",
        "A: My aunt -- yeah, this was -- I had -- my aunt prepared for us an apartment. And -- so this\nwas, but my husband didn\u2019t have a job yet, so he went around til he find himself a job. We\nbrought a little bit money with us. We were doing a little business in Italy, so we were not\ncompletely, you know, penniless. So we brought a little bit money with us and -- and then\nhe start looking for a job, he find a -- a job in the United Typewriter Company, was at that\ntime. And he was working down there for a few years, til he went in business for himself.\nAnd I -- I was home taking care of the kids, they were little. I wanted to go also in the\nteaching, to be like a Sunday and I had to leave the kids on Sundays and I decided against it,\nI said, \u201cIt\u2019s more important for me to be with the children than to leave them on Sundays,\nunsupervised.\u201d And maybe I did a good choice, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were you learning English?",
        "A: Yeah, Hebrew. I wanted to go in Hebrew and then I -- 1-1t was not a lot of English to\nknow that, you know, in the school, in the Hebrew school, cause I want to teach in Hebrew.\nWas Hebrew and some other and that was a parochial Hebrew school in Washington. I had\nto go trum a little with a few courses, because I was already aware of being -- in the camp, I\nwas teaching first graders and kindergarten. So I -- I had to go through a course and then I\ndidn\u2019t -- I decided against it. I said it was more important for the kids -- sometimes we used\nto go out skating o-or skiing even, we went away for the weekends. And we were together\nwith the family, so I think this was -- it was not a bad choice at that time.",
        "Q: What a -- what about your other experiences in adjusting to this new society? Was there\nanything notable about it, that -- that stood out as being very different from where you --\nwh-what you had come from or what you ex -- anything different than what you expected?",
        "A: It was different. Some people were preoccupied with things that did not -- there a lot of\nemphasis money, money, money -- and something that sometimes used to rub me the wrong\nway. But you know, and I thought maybe because we didn\u2019t feel strongly, that I could not\nfigure out what it is sometimes used to rub me [inaudible] the wrong way. And -- but little\nby little we adjusted. We were different, I would say. You know, but I did not blame,\nbecause I went through my journey, life was a completely different one from the people\nwho were born in here, that didn\u2019t experience no hardship, nothing. They were spoiled in\nmy estimation, in my eyes. Sometimes I used to call them the spoiled America. But maybe\nif everything would be in target down there in my family and my things, I don\u2019t know how\nwould it be.",
        "Q: Did you form fre -- did you form friendships with Americans?",
        "A: Yes. I formed friendship with Americans, but mostly we were involved with the\nsurvivors. But af -- we did, we had very good fre --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Brenda Senders. This is tape four, side A.\nOkay, your friendships -- your friendships with -- some of them were with survivors and\nsome with non-survivors?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you feel a gap, in a way, that you were -- when you were with survivors, you were\nwith people of your own kind and when you weren\u2019t, you were with a different kind of\nperson? Was there that kind of division?",
        "A: Something, maybe if I would find the chemistry would work, maybe it would be okay,\non the -- not -- but with some I felt closer, with Americans, but more closer with -- I -- I\nused to feel with -- with survivors, because our journey in life is almost, you know -- each\none is different, but similar I think. Whatever we went through, we could converse, you\ncould understand more each other. But we had a lot of friends that were not survivors.",
        "Q: Did you feel that they could re -- that those friends who were non-survivors could really\nunderstand what you had been through?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. And I's -- and I always said I am not -- I don\u2019t want you\nto feel sorry for me, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s not because, you know, some understanding, not exactly to\nfeel, you know, they see the war, that\u2019s [inaudible] to me. But it was behind their\nunderstanding. The first time, when I came out to speak to those people about my partisan\nactivities, about being -- I\u2019m telling you, I made a impression on people. They went through\nthat time, difficult, difficult, difficult times. One became a lawyer and the other one I met,\nabout si -- about eight or nine years later, in Washington. And she looked very much, you\nknow, very blonde and very, you know, she looks like a Swedish girl. And there she tells a\nstory, she was -- she heard all kinds of stories about the Jews and here she heard me telling\nall these thing -- all these things. And I met her and I said, \u201cAre you\u2019re Gilbert? Are you\u2019re\nnot the girl who was at the first meeting when I spoke?\u201d And I told her where and on\nWillard Avenue, down there on the UJA? \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cyes, are you Brenda?\u201d Och, she\nstarted telling all her friends, you know, because I recognized her, her face was so -- so --\nthey -- told her friends, what -- and then -- then I said -- I invited her to our business and she\nsaid to my son, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what impression your mother made on me. She made me -\n- she made me do things. I forced myself.\u201d So my son made, again a remark, he said, \u201cShe\nmade a impression on me, too,\u201d you know, my son. And so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s did something, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- I think my story, it made a difference, I don\u2019t know what words I can choose\nfor.",
        "Q: When did you start speaking about your experiences?",
        "A: It was in the late 60\u2019s, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but something in the late 60\u2019s, 70,\nbefore -- they start already talking about the museum and then -- and then I came and one\ngirl who was a friend of mine, I start telling her, said, \u201cBrenda, toil, tell them the story.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cIf you hold my hands, I'll tell the story.\u201d And I came about and I start telling them\nand I start telling them, little by little, I was nervous like a kid. And -- and -- and they\naccepted it very nicely. And after I explained to them, who were the partisans, where the\npartisans, how did I wind up down there and what our journey was, what we did. And it was\na eye opener for them all.",
        "Q: Who was this group that -- who was this first group that you were speaking to?",
        "A: It was a UJA group. But I think it was still -- there were some professional people, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly.",
        "Q: UJ --",
        "A: We were adults.",
        "Q: United Jewish Appeal?",
        "A: Yeah. We were adults and it was a full, full, big room, we were three girls with -- my\nstory somehow, at that time, was okay.",
        "Q: How did the -- how did the UJA get in touch with you to do this or did you get in touch\nwith them?",
        "A: We were in a group, a survivors group and in the survivors group, they knew that I\u2019m\none of the survivors and I was very much involved, yeah, in Washington with bonds in the\norganization Nahamat, that used to call Golda Meir, you know, the pioneer of women -- it\u2019s\na Golda Meir club that\u2019s -- and now they call it Nahamat. So I was down there as a member.\nAnd then I belonged to the -- to the survivors group. In the UJA, some time they wanted to\nknow more about the survivors and I was the one of us invited. And I came -- I was working\ndown there in business a little bit -- I came and I told them a little bit about my story, they\nsaid they wanted to hear more. So I came in a -- a evening, we were three -- thr -- two of us\n-- three of us, so each one was telling a story. I was different because I wasn\u2019t down there, I\nwent on to the partisans. But I was one of the first one, actually, who came out to speak\nabout it. And this is a fact.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: For the opening of the museum",
        "Q: Did it seem to you at the time that these people you were speaking to really didn\u2019t know\nabout what you were telling them? Was it new to them?",
        "A: I used to ask him, after a -- I went through a little bit, \u201cDo you follow my thoughts? Do\nyou -- if not, please ask me later on, questions.\u201d Because I went through a little bit and you\nknow, it\u2019s my story, but it\u2019s -- if they will comprehend this. They said, \u201cYes, yes,\u201d and then,\nafterwards, they ask me some questions. But I think they did res -- was receptive to my\nstory. I think -- I think so. And this was my first and then I used to go out to schools and\nthen I worked with the children -- to schools a lody and speak to the students. And then I\nwalked in the children\u2019s museum, if you remember -- \u2018Remember the Children\u2019, before\nopening of the museum in Washington, I used to go down there sometimes three or four\ntimes a week. It was in northeast, down there on Eighth Street or something.",
        "Q: L -- L Street, I -- probably?",
        "A: A -- lin -- there is a children\u2019s museum down there with all international -- there is mec --\nthere 1s all kind of -- you know, on top used to be \u2018Remember the Children\u2019. It was Mrs.\nYates, it was the congresswoman was instrumental of -- of telling the story about the\nchildren, she shed -- s-she owns and it was a very -- a very wise choice at that time. I used to\ngo down there as a survivor to tell my story to the children. They were not allow children\nbelow six. And they had to be accompanied by their parents. Because it was, you know, it\nwas a sad story. And -- and then, after w-we were finished, that was -- the entrance was a\nmovie, then it was a whole wall of children, pre-war children, Jewish kids. Then it was a\nhouse in Germany, a Jewish family, the aroma even of the food you can smell and the\nsinging of the classical music. A -- a regular house, a middle -- middle class, or maybe -- I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of, but they\u2019re Jewish, nice home and then it used to be the resistant\nand then the family Voss, who saved a lot the Jewish children in Holland, I think, Mrs. Voss\ncomes. I -- I think she comes from Holland. She made a tunnel and I think they saved some\n-- | -- | met her. She came -- she be -- was honored in Washington. Her husband and her. So\nthere were the Voss family, the story about them and then used to be a la -- a little like\nlibrary with the Anne Frank\u2019s books, with all the books and these and the kids used to go all\nthis way and there was a book with they write their names and after they listen to whatever\nthe eyewitness was. They used to come back and write their impression or their feelings or\nwhatever they wanted. And I had a lot of nice -- nice little notes for me, you know. It\u2019s still\nsomeplace in the museum, must be. And -- and I used to explain to them and after we used\nto give them tiles. And on the tiles we used to ask them after I told them my little story, you\nknow, in the children\u2019s version, I could not go in in this and I told them, you have the Hitler\nand your orders, explain to them he was a bad man and all the thing explained in their own -\n- in their own level, for them to understand. And then we used to give them those tiles, they\nused to paint on the tiles and then they put it down, whatever their feelings in their heart.\nAnd the best tiles are now in -- on the wall in Washington. Down there where you go down\non the -- on the left hand after a whole wall. This is the tiles where I used to go down there\nand work with the kids. Now they minimized this one, \u201cRemember the Children\u2019, they made\nit Daniel\u2019s story -- out of it. So this is the Dantel\u2019s story, next -- you know, coming after\n\u201cRemember the Children\u2019.",
        "Q: You continued to speak to -- have you continued to speak to civic groups and youth\ngroups up until the present day?",
        "A: I did. I did -- I didn\u2019t do for awhile and I\u2019m afraid if I\u2019m not rusty already, I have to write\nit down. Sometimes I say it just from my remembering, but I -- I think I have to -- I didn\u2019t\ndo it for awhile but I -- I like to. I used to do it a lot of m-more in Washington. And here I\ngo also. Once in awhile here, once in awhile there to -- to tell my story. Yes, this is a letter I\nreceived from a student after I shared my story with them and I thought -- I was very\ntouched and I thought I should read it -- I should read it here today. First he addressed to\nme, giving to his teacher because I didn\u2019t give out my -- my address. And he said to me,\n\u201cThank you for giving that remarkable, tragic story of your youth experience. I know no one\nthat wasn\u2019t there could understand the pain and toro -- and torment or could give you\nenough apologies or forgiveness. But [Il try to understand and feel what you have felt. I\nalso know -- I also know that there are those trails to be dealt with. I want to convert in\nbeing a Jew, with your help, I would like to be one. Please get in contact with me.\u201d And he\nsigned his name, Isaac.",
        "Q: And you said something about -- tell me something about this school or the background\nof this young man. Where he -- do you know anything about him?",
        "A: It -- it was -- later I find out it was -- it was in a poor section, it was a lody infested with\ndrugs. I didn\u2019t know at that time. But after I went and I spoke to this group and there were\nthis girl -- after my -- after my addressing and after my telling my story, the teacher came to\nme, she said, \u201cMrs. Senders you know, you don\u2019t know how much good you did.\u201d I said,\n\u201cWhat did I do, I just told my story.\u201d He said, \u201cThis girl had ta -- she was a drug addict and\nshe had to had the fix at the certain time and time when you spoke. And she didn\u2019t went to\ntake her fix, she was so interested and so absorbed and so in -- 1n your story, that she stayed\nthrough all this time.\u201d And it touched me very, very much.",
        "Q: What happened with this young man, did he convert to Judaism?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I called him up, he gave me his telephone through the teacher and I said,\n\u201cThis is not my mission, to convert nobody. If you want to convert to Judaism, you have to\nfind your own way, how to do it, through some other channels, but this is just me telling and\nsharing my story, what I went through and this should never happen to no one.\u201d And there\nwas another student in this same -- in this same school and he was a student from a mixed\nmarriage. His mother was German, his father was American. And he -- and he said he\u2019s\ngoing to Germany to see his grandparents. So I said, \u201cYou heard my story,\u201d I said, \u201ccan you\ngive me a promise?\u201d I said to talk to your grandparents and to tell them. And I think this\nwas my reward that day for speaking to those kids. I said, \u201cTell them exactly in the words I\ntold you.\u201d",
        "Q: Did he say that he would?",
        "A: And he promised he would.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear what the results of that were?",
        "A: No. I did not -- I did not follow up on -- on things, you know, I didn\u2019t follow up. But this\nwas a very, very impressive -- I touched -- I was touched by it. Because the kids listened,\nthe kids understood and this 1s something.",
        "Q: And it was not only that they listened and understood, but this young man was so moved",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: By what you said, that he wanted to become a Jew --",
        "A: That he want actually to convert to Judaism.",
        "Q: That\u2019s great.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- yeah, I thought so very much. It was very -- and I -- I said to him, \u201cDo you want\nall this trouble?\u201d You know, I mades a little joke with him, that\u2019s all. But I never followed\nup. Maybe I should, or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, but I never did.",
        "Q: When did you -- was there a point where you started to feel that you were an American,\nthat you were at home here?",
        "A: You know, when I was very frightened was the McCarthy era? Was very, very -- to us\nsurvivor, it was -- it was very unpleasant. But then, whatever we went through, I said, \u201cThis\nour home.\u201d This -- I felt more comfortable each year as I -- the kids are growing up, going\nto school and I felt more comfortable each year. This is my country -- there where I live and\nI am a part of it. But my story should go, I think, from generation to generation. People\nshould learn from our experience. It\u2019s a big responsibility, but we\u2019ll do it.",
        "Q: Tell me more about that -- the M-McCarthy era and what -- what you experienced.",
        "A: It\u2019s a frightening thing, was it. With all the accusation, with all the -- the Communist, not\nCommunist, the thing -- all this -- this thing, it was mixed up and it -- and we went -- we\nwere there -- we came here and it didn\u2019t -- some of the things didn\u2019t even make sense to us.\nT-Turn around people upside down to make labels on them, to -- and it was -- it\u2019s like a\nreverse, like coming back. And it was -- to me it was a very -- a very -- a very frightful thing\nand a very worrisome -- not fright -- a worrisome thing. I said, \u201cGod almighty, we went\nthrough a war and -- what you see, we\u2019re living through that, too.\u201d",
        "Q: Were people -- did people discriminate against you for being from this -- from what they\nconsidered the Soviet block? I know there was a lot of paranoia, so you -- did you\nexperience?",
        "A: A lot of paranoia, it was -- didn\u2019t had no ground for it. It didn\u2019t had -- they portray all\nthese -- the Russian like they would be stupid til the Sputnik come into being. And here I\ncame from down there and I know the people were very smart and I remember Mrs.\nRoosevelt in the 50\u2019s, went to the Soviet Union, she came back and she said, \u201cThere are\ncertain things we can learn from them. Their educational system,\u201d I remember distinctly the\nway She said it, \u201cwe can learn from them certain things.\u201d And it\u2019s -- and -- and I agreed at\nthat time because you know -- you know, if you want, like I think Eisenhower said it, if you\nwant to fight the enemy, you have to know your enemy. And there are certain traits, good\ntraits you have to learn from. And -- so this was -- this was a s-struck me a little bit f-funny.\nBut then, little by little, I -- I said, \u201cWe are a part of this universe and we are here to stay.\nAnd the choice\u2019ll be ours.\u201d",
        "Q: It must have been, I mean, that -- that -- that -- the Cold War going on for -- for decades\nwith -- with the -- the -- the Soviet Union.",
        "A: This -- yeah.",
        "Q: And was that in some way difficult for you, because you were supported by the Soviets\nthrough the war in some way and -- and --",
        "A: When I came out to speak, I -- I explained to the kids, \u201cListen, Japan was our enemies\nyesterday, today they our friends.\u201d To make sense out of the whole -- the whole thing. So I\nsaid, \u201cThey\u2019re -- they were our enemies. They were arch enemies. What they did in -- in --\nin Pearl -- in Pearl Harbor. And here,\u201d I said, \u201cthe Soviets, don\u2019t forget, they were our allies.\nIt was a choice between two evils and Hitler was the master of evils.\u201d",
        "Q: Did it seem strange to the -- to you that the United States took such a friendly\nrelationship with Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Somewhat, yet. I feel like when, who said it, I\u2019m a Berlinner? Something that struck me\nlittle bit in the funny way. Me, [inaudible]. I think some -- all survivors felt the same. And\nthey have to still repent. And I understand what revolution right now in Germany 1s the\nbook by the author -- the author\u2019s name is Daniel John Goldhagen, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing\nExecutioners.\u201d Made a big like -- revelation in Germany. The youth at the third generation\nare as -- are asking question their grandparents. \u201cWhat did you do, why did it happen?\u201d\nThey find out the real -- the real thing about the past behind. So this is something is turning\naround, slowly, but maybe in the right direction.",
        "Q: Do you remember that -- the moment that was all over the news that the Berlin wall was\ncoming down and -- and that -- that Communist era was -- of the Soviet Block was coming\nto an end and -- and there was c -- there was suddenly this freedom among those nations. Do\nyou remember what you felt?",
        "A: I felt sort of resentment about the Germans and -- and the Berlin wall I thought maybe\nwas the price they had to pay, maybe more so. But this Berlin wall was maybe a price they\nhad to pay for the atrocities and the horrible things they have done to other human beings.\nThey\u2019re other human beings, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Did it seem that -- I think for many Americans, there was the sense that suddenly this\nwhole world that was closed before, suddenly became open and it was possible to go visit\nand it was possible to -- you know, if you wanted to go to Poland or if you wanted to go to -\n- it was going to be easier and there -- there was going to be access in some way. Did you\nhave that feeling, did you start to think about the possibility of -- of returning to your\nhometown and seeing what it -- ha-had become of it?",
        "A: For a long time, no, but now later I wanted just for a visit. I would never return to live\nthere, never. There is nothing except the cemetery and I am not about to go. They did to\ntheir own people and it\u2019s not worth it to go and be among -- be amongst them -- to their own\ncitizen and as I said, I was a national Pole. That\u2019s all. If I went out from the country, it\u2019s\nnobody\u2019s business was religion I -- I accept -- if I don\u2019t eat this type of food or something,\nbut this is nobody\u2019s business. But I was a Polish national. And here we became criminals.\nAnd this is, yes the resentment I had. They help didn\u2019t -- the people gave us very, very little\nhelp. They paid a price too, afterwards. The revolt in -- in Warsaw ghetto, the -- in the war -\n- after the Warsaw ghetto, the revolt in -- in Warsaw. They start doing to the Poles, to the --\nto the -- to the Catholics, little by little the same thing. But they were already -- they already\ncut out -- they minimized already the Jews. They would have a bigger force to get together\nand fight their enemy, but they didn\u2019t use their heads. So I -- they betrayed us and I felt very\nmuch betrayed by my own countrymen. And that\u2019s the thing I have to deal with.",
        "Q: Tell me about how you -- how you educated your children, what your goals were of -- of\nwhat to teach them. What -- what was important to you that you conveyed to them about --\nfrom your own life experiences about what they should -- what they should know for their\nown -- for their own lives.",
        "A: To stand on their feet and take no -- no nonsense, you know, play with the kids, not to let\nnobody to abuse them. Tell them in a nice way once, twice and the third time give it back to\nthe kid who bothers you. I told them I will not fight your fight. You have to stand on your\nown two feet and fight them. I told them to be decent, to be understanding to other people,\nbut never to be intimidated by nobody and nothing. We are a part of this universe and we\u2019 ll\nstay here forever and the choice will be ours, whatever religion each one of us will choose.\nIf we choose to be Jews, we will be that.",
        "Q: Did they ask you about your experiences during the Holocaust and -- and your husband\u2019s\nexperiences?",
        "A: They know. My Sherry went -- my Sherry was in -- 1n -- well, she went actually when I\nspoke down there at the United Jewish Appeal, she was present and she was in support, you\nknow, she was sitting in the audience and she listening and I said, \u201cYou [indecipherable] or\nsomething bore to listen.\u201d And she said it was okay. So they know all about it.",
        "Q: When they were children, did they? Did they know?",
        "A: No. When they were very young, if they ask me Is -- I told them. I didn\u2019t -- for hiding,\nin my case. I\u2019m not speaking for the other ones, in my case. They cames once, was a\nCatholic kid teased, theys tel-telling the stories and I said it, \u201cJust tell them off, Just go and\ntell them off.\u201d They give me some -- I said, \u201cI\u2019m not mixing any your fights, you\u2019ll have to\nfight your own fight. With grown-ups I will not ask you to fight for me, nor with the kids.\u201d\nAnd I remember one of my neighbor, ones that -- she was like a referee, she used to go out\nand fight for the kids and this and then, til all of a sudden sh -- come and tell me stories,\nthis, that, this one fight thats one and the other one fight the other one. And I said, \u201cEvelyn,\nyou wanted to be a referee, it\u2019s your business. I\u2019m not mixing in.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know the\nkids, they will fight and in two minutes they will play together. Me and you,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\nwill have a fight and a good one and we will not talk any more. So I am not about, so --.\u201d\nYou know she start laughing and that\u2019s it and that was the end of it. I -- you know you have\nto, in everything it\u2019s -- there is I think, logic. To understand life the way it is, not to find any\n-- all the -- the -- the junk in life. To find something good. And to convey to the next -- first\nof all in your family, it\u2019s where the nucleus, where the -- where it starts, all those things.\nAnd actually, practice what you preach or don\u2019t say nothing. Actually do practice what you\n-- what you say. And I think of families, they\u2019re okay. Maybe I\u2019m li -- but lucky also, you\nknow, there was a period with the drugs and things, it was a little bit uneasy, but everything\nis all right. So I don\u2019t know what we knew, but that\u2019s the way it is. I did what I thought it\u2019s\nright and I think eventually it comes out right, if you do what\u2019s right. It\u2019s not what you say\nto the kids, what you do -- what you do. That\u2019s my understanding.",
        "Q: What did you teach them about Judaism?",
        "A: About Judaism, I told them -- we were not exactly a religious, more traditional Jews.\nThey know how much I\u2019ve -- we suffered being -- being of that faith. Our -- our -- both\ndaughters are not religious. They observe the holidays when they come, they know it, but\nthey are not [inaudible]. I myself -- our son more would go -- like to go to synagogue, to\npray. The holidays he takes his son. And also we tass, we go -- we belong to a synagogue\nand we go down there, it\u2019s Conservative. And it\u2019s more tradition with me. And I say there is\na Hebrew saying, \u201cI have a dintata with God.\u201d I have a grievance, I have a dispute with\nGod. Why did it happen to our people? And there is God, why was there silence? And that\u2019s\nthe answer, I guess you have all was [inaudible].",

        "Q: You were raising your children -- well, in the post-war era there were so many changes\nin the culture here and some of them happened very quickly, particularly in the 60\u2019s, when -\n- when there was the -- the -- the landing on the moon and the -- the Vietnam War, late 60\u2019s\nand -- and then the Feminist movement and the Civil Rights movement and then there was\nthe Free Love and you mentioned dru -- your fear of -- of your kids getting involved in\ndrugs, but wh -- did you feel like all of the -- did you feel any identification with these\nmovements that were happening, or interest in -- in these movements or did you sort of want\nto protect your family from -- from all of these changes? I don\u2019t know if you can speak that\ngenerally, but --",
        "A: It was -- it was changes happening and it was certainly interesting. You know, the -- the\nwomen -- equally -- what do we call it?",
        "Q: Equal Rights --",
        "A: The Equal Rights --",
        "Q: Am-Amend-Amendment?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, because it was interesting and it was okay. Sometimes they started asking\nme -- as soon as we are liberated? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t -- I -- we not -- we did\nnot use at that time the word.\u201d I guess I was. I was in my action. So I -- you understand? It\nwas interesting, because after I see the abuse in families and all those things with th --\nhusband and wife. We -- I never saw in our family, I never saw in my surrounding, where I\nwas in my little, in -- in my family down there, but then I start, you know, I heard it\u2019s all this\nabuse and all this -- this -- this -- this -- this bad things. So it was -- 1t was interesting. It was\nsomething moving, something going. It came a little bit mo -- to a lot of extremes, but it\u2019s\ncomes to the extremes and then it\u2019s levels off. And -- and in the 60\u2019s, we did drugs, I was a\nlittle bit concerned. I said, \u201cThis is bad.\u201d I used to tell my kids, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t need\ndrugs, just touch me. I\u2019m full of life, without drugs.\u201d I don\u2019t need it. You don\u2019t need to -- to\n-- to get -- to get the drugs to numb yourself. Why? Do you think this 1s something? It\u2019s a\ndrug in your body. I use to explain, but this was like -- like in style, like it comes like a --\nlike a yo-yo, it\u2019s comes like a thing and it\u2019s -- you know, the kids get involved and the\npressure in schools and all those things. And I used to watch my kids. I remember my\nmiddle daughter was a little bit a revolutionary. You know, more in -- in Los Angeles. And\nshe came when Woodstock came about. Woodstock. She came to me and she said she wants\nto go to Woodstock. I didn\u2019t know Woodstock from another city. Did I know Woodstock? I\nsaid, \u201cWho is going to Woodstock? What is Woodstock? Where 1s it?\u201d She start telling me\nsome -- it is in New York and kids are going. It\u2019s who is going and how many kids are\ngoing, some of your friend? I start asking all those questions and right away she start telling\nme a lot of kids, Woodstock, where is that? I said, \u201cNo, let them go, you are not going. No\nway, over my dead body, you are not going,\u201d I said. She was a -- a kid on -- a kid -- not -- n\n-- | don\u2019t remember how -- how old was she at that time when Woodstock was. I said, \u201cNo\nway.\u201d It\u2019s something I felt -- I sensed intuitively. There is a danger down there. And you see\nwhat happened. They almost -- it almost tump, you know, the stampedoed. There was not\nthe facilities, not even water -- drinking water down there for the kids. So I -- I sensed it,\nmaybe from my experience, or just I sensed it -- it\u2019s something wrong in that situation. Oh,\nshe started wearing those, I remember some kind of -- from a rag she made something. You\nknow, the Arab and the kids are all doing all those things. And it\u2019s also struck me funny, we\nhad beggars who used to go around with those things. And she thought she will talk me into\nsome nonsense, I said, \u201cNo way.\u201d But I let it, you know, freedom, I did not constantly, I\nsaid, \u201cLet her see it their own way. Let her see it\u2019s not the right thing.\u201d\u201d And somehow they\ngrow up, all of them, from --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side B",

        "Q: Pll go ahead and ask a question unless you -- were you in the middle of saying\nsomething? No?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. You mentioned the -- the Feminist movement and the Equal Rights Amendment\nand the -- the -- that that was sort of interesting to you. You ha-had obviously had an\nexperience during the war of -- of doing something that many of us might consider being\nstereotypically male. You were fighting with a partisan group. You -- you learned how to\nride a horse and ho -- shoot a gun. So -- so in some ways, th -- would you say those\ndivisions didn\u2019t exist in your mind, of the male role and the female role?",
        "A: Not re -- I said it\u2019s another human being, I -- I saw it. And some -- and some girls did,\nsome attached themselves down there to some man. It didn\u2019t work out anyway. But they\nattached themself and it -- and it went from the office and it did not -- it did not work, it\ndidn\u2019t make sense. They thought maybe they\u2019 Il get her e-easy, I don\u2019t know what -- what\nmade them, what motivated them. You understand? But for my part, I saw it -- it was\nwrong. I\u2019m doing anyway, so what I have to -- if I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to. I saw them\nas another human being. And it was difficult. You know, it was still, you know -- but\nsomehow we didn\u2019t sense -- it\u2019s funny we didn\u2019t sense at that time, because the girls and the\nboys, we were -- we were fighting, like, the same fight. Maybe in other groups, in other -- I\ndon\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the way I was surrounding and I was.",

After I heard, you know, the -- the -- what happened and what -- what they are\nfighting, you understand, you cannot just fight for something that\u2019s not in existence, but it\u2019s\n-- it [indecipherable] were abusing, where a man, you know this macho man, they thought\nthey are -- who knows, they are almighty. And -- and the woman had to stay home and --\nand -- and be like, you know, a little slave girl or whatever.

        "A: For equal rights, yeah. I thought people -- people are people, they should have,\ndefinitely. They were oppressed. We used to see them oversea in Europe and we don\u2019t like\nit. And especially this [indecipherable] serve -- the way they beat them, the way they -- they\nkill them, the way they lynch them. And we were -- a lody -- a lody of the movies we saw in\nEurope. And this is -- it was re-revolting to me. I said, \u201cThey are people. They are\nstruggling, this their right.\u201d You know, they were not asked to be brought here into the\nStates. They were brought for the convenience at that time, for the white. Now they\u2019re --\nthey -- they\u2019re emancipated, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re free.

She\u2019s now in Washington, so she -- my son, she\u2019s like second\nmother, you know and she\u2019s single now. She was married, divorced and she didn\u2019t want it,\nto be married any more.

Let\u2019s say we are talking about iron\nprayer. The -- if we talk about, you know, I\u2019m not going 1n politics, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m an\nAmerican, but this is a small country, surrounded all by the enemies. And they wanted\npeace. But let looks the other side, you have to be objective and look at it. And they, you\nknow, like -- this is a little bit, you know, not frightened -- Israel will be here forever. It\u2019s\nhere to stay. But it is a concern, yeah. It\u2019s a wonderful little country and it\u2019s democracy in\nthe Middle East and it\u2019s the only democracy and they\u2019re our friends. And you know, I\nwould talk about -- I always show a map, take a look on that teensy weensy Israel and\nthanks God for they\u2019re round me and they are strong. And my -- my thing, you see, during\nmy second World War, the experience, the way it were, if he would have been stopped, if\nHitler would have been stopped after he crossed Austria, the Anschluss and then you see?\nThe appetite came, in the Anschluss and then he started harassing Czechoslovakia. I\nremember we had a friend, a Czechoslovakian friend, she cried. I remember I stood next to\nmy mother, she cried with tears, poor thing, she was adorable lady. They had a -- a wursht\nstore, you know, from salamis? And they were such a neat people, grade -- we used to come\ndown there and buy for our grocery. And when they -- when they -- when they invaded\nCzechoslovakia, she cried with tears in her eyes. And you see what happened? They gave\nhim a free hand and what happened? So if he would have been stopped, he wouldn\u2019t have\nthe guts to do it -- what he did to a lot of people. And then he started harassing and we know\nit from history, what the next step was. So that\u2019s the way I see.",

Somehow, not mentally, not -- I thought all old people and I was not young,\nbut I was not mentally old -- in something, in my mind I thought that old people are going to\nFlorida.

        "A: Yes, I had friends, I had friends who were Polish Catholics and especially during the\nRussian, when the Russian came and I went to this -- I\u2019m sorry -- and I went to this Russian\nschool. So I had a lody of my friends were of -- of Greek Orthodox, there is a lot of people\nwho -- down there in my part of the country they Greek or Orthodox or they\u2019re of Catholic\npersuasion. So I had from wode to you know, some of Catholics, something I didn\u2019t ask\nexactly who was what, because it didn\u2019t matter. But I had a lot of friends who were non --\nwho were non-Jews.",
        "A: Not after the Russian occupation, but with the Germans. After the -- when the Russian\noccupation was -- was you know, equality was then -- then -- you know, you are --\neverybody supposedly, you know, the minority, the -- we didn\u2019t have no problems at that\ntime. We went to school together, we went and -- and was every -- ev -- it was very, very\nnice and very, very congenial. But when the Germans came, it changed completely. Some of\nmy friends became not friends. They would see us and they would turn -- oh, I don\u2019t know,\nthey were intimidated or they were afraid or they didn\u2019t want to get involved, I don\u2019t know\nwhich way. And we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t proceed to -- to ask any question, because you\nknow, we were like prisoners in our own city, in our own country. And we were closed in in\nthese ghettos, but absolutely a change. Our neighbors -- our neighbors looked away from us,\nbecause when I lived in the ghetto, we had a lody non-Jewish neighbors, they were\nChristians, who stayed in the ghetto, they didn\u2019t had to move out, stayed in the ghetto and\nbefore we were friendly neighbors, we said hello, hi, this, that and right when the Germans\ncame, and the -- and the import of this venom came, right away they changed their attitude.\nSome of them joined this -- this evil ca -- this evil German, the -- their Fascist groups and --\nand it changed their attitude. But this was the lesser tragedies, you know, what had befallen\nthe -- our people in our -- and my people from my town. And that\u2019s what I -- I -- I can think\nof this -- of this -- actually of this -- of this m -- of this minute. We had a lot of friends that -\n- see a girl who worked for us -- I remember she used to be working, she was a -- some\nmaid, was working, but she\u2019s a orphan. And I remember my mother actually married her\noff. And she used to call my mother \u2018mother\u2019. She liked my mother because she gave her a\ndowry and she married her off to a very nice guy and sh-she didn\u2019t had nobody. And when\nthe Germans came, her husband came and he warned, actually, my family. He came into the\nghetto and he said to my father, \u201cRemember, you know I hear very bad news. I think they\nare -- they are ready to kill all the Jews.\u201d My father had a very tem-temper and he -- he nee -\n- got so upset and he actually chased him out from the house. He didn\u2019t want it to believe.\nYou know sometimes you just don\u2019t want it to believe. You think it\u2019s just spreading some\nrumors, some bate in the Germans, because [indecipherable] situation.",
        "A: If she -- my mother -- if she thought differently, I --I never heard, she just -- she went\nthrough one World -- the first World War. So she thought, \u201cLet us just go through it.\u201d It\u2019s\nlike, we\u2019ll go through it somehow, you know. And she was -- she wanted to. And -- and she\nwas expecting, I guess, to go through it. Maybe she was on a more posit -- I don\u2019t -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t -- but she did not verbally, actually talk to us. But she was very much worried, very\nmuch so. And -- and I used to go out from the ghetto, used to bring some food, on the risk of\nmy life. And I told once, a little -- I -- I said I know of on the tape. I went out from the\nghetto with my sister, we took off our rags, we went and we got some -- some blackberries\nand some bread, what I ask some of the peasants to give us. And at night when we are\ncoming back to the ghetto, and our house was right -- we were living -- to the end we were\nliving right by the gate -- right by the fence, not by the gate, by the fence. And down there,\nin a little -- a barn was in the -- in the -- near the house and we made a hole. Through this\nhole I used to go out to the free -- to be free. And then, when I wanted to go out to th --\ncome into the ghetto, I had to open again the hole and come in. And come in back to the\nghetto. And I remember at night, I came with my sister, we came with -- I came with my\nsister and my -- my bag, my -- actually my -- fell on the -- on the ground. And a policeman\nwas walking right in front of our house -- a -- a Ukrainian policeman was patrolling at night.\nAnd when my package -- I captured a package like I carried on my -- on my shoul -- on my\n-- on my back. A b -- like a -- not a backpack, but like a package. And I -- and it dropped on\nthe floor. And he start listening and we s -- and we froze, my sister and I froze. And --\nbecause we\u2019re -- we -- we thought, that\u2019s the end. We were standing down there and he\nlistened attentively and then he went again walking and at that time, you know, my mother\nwas standing in the window and looking and expecting us. If she didn\u2019t got a heart attack at\nthat time, it was a miracle. We opened the little hole, we went in. My mother -- I didn\u2019t\nhevywith to knock at the door, my mother opened the door, very quietly and as long as these\nfootsteps of the German -- of the Ukrainian policemens, he couldn\u2019t hear the -- the opening\nor the closing of the -- of the doors. That\u2019s how we went in and we brought our food,\nwhatever -- whatever we could acquire during the day. On the outside we were free, on the\ninside we have to put again our -- our -- our rags that we are -- that we are branded for\nsomething. And I remember a woman, I remember before they put us in the ghetto, was a\nfriend for us, so she came there, cried, actually. They were friends of ours, the -- the\nUkrainian, there were some good souls. And they said, \u201cYou know -- you know,\u201d to my\nmother, \u201cthis is a bad omen. They are -- they are -- they are putting you all in one -- in one -\n- in one place. This 1s something -- a bad sign.\u201d\u201d And my mother yelled at her, said, \u201cWe will\nloov -- live through this too.\u201d But she -- she sensed that because they went through already a\nwar before and they knew what\u2019s all about.",
        "A: Months, a few months -- a few months. They ask from all the villages, from all the\nplaces, all the Jews must leave their premises and come into the ghetto. And their orders us\nse -- ordered us in like -- like in -- in -- in five our -- us -- our part of the city was\npredominantly Jewish, all of the Jews, the rest of the Jews from these small, were crowded.\nLike I -- I had, for example, I don\u2019t know if I said it in the tape, for example in my -- in the\nhouse where we lived, I don\u2019t know, 12, 14 people were in there. They slept on the floor,\nslept any place we could sleep. And remember, at night, we used to be frightened to death\nbecause we had a curfew, at seven or eight. What the curfew for the Jews, nobody was\nallowed to go out, anybody was being caught outside strolling around, he would be shot.\nAnd it\u2019s no less punishment was than that. But at night we used to -- we -- we lived not far\nour house, was not far from the gate. Actually when you enter the gate in the beginning. So\nsome -- at night, when we used to hear some trucks would be come in to the ghetto and we\ndidn\u2019t know if this is they\u2019re coming to grab some people -- to grab them from the ghetto, or\nte -- or to -- they are people -- actually Christians who are coming back from work. And we\n-- we heard already the truck passing by the house and going away on the -- on -- on\nwhatever he went, we were quiet down. And in this manner we had to live more than a year.\nIt was an eternity.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, during the time of the Germans? No. A few times they took us, they had to as -- they\nask us to -- each family had to give a certain amount of work a week. A few times I went for\nthem, silly things are done there. They take stones and t-take stone from one place to\nanother one. All kind -- and manual work, it didn\u2019t mean anything. But I remember working\nnear a bridge and this is also -- I used to get some food, I used to go in -- in the peasant\nhouse and ask him sometimes for a piece of bread or something. And there were some good\nsouls who were helping us, too.",
        "A: N-No, my father had to work as a laborer, you know. Let\u2019s say -- they would assigned\neach houses, they -- as to come to the Unerat. The Unerat is the Jewish, you know, consul.\nSo it\u2019s the -- a certain amount of work each week. So, my father used to go down there with\n-- with a group of people out of the ghetto. And sometimes he would encounter some of his\npeople who knew him, they loved him. He was known in the whole -- the whole region\ndown there as a good man. And he was helping, we were ourself in artridge, he was helping\nsome actually other -- other people. And when they met him, they used to take their bread\nand give it to him and he used to bring it to the ghetto. That\u2019s how he was, well known. In\nsome of the -- of the -- of the Ukrainian, they were -- and they said, \u201cOh God, what they are\ndoing to you?\u201d And sometimes they were coming and grabbing some of the belongings of\nthe Jews and some of the good souls in Ukrainian used to say, \u201cRemember,\u201d some smart\none, they said, \u201ctoday them, tomorrow us.\u201d And it was that way. And I always say, if I am in\ndanger, remember, you are next in line,[1ndecipherable] if you are not doing the right thing,\nif you -- they are not -- the right thing.",
        "A: We used to meet friends, among friends and read, discuss things in -- discuss things, in\nhope. We still have some hopes that maybe -- we used to hear news penetrated into ghetto,\nthat\u2019s -- something about the Americans declaring war on Germany, something I heard in\nthe ghetto, I don\u2019t whether they got -- 1t was 1n ninetin not yet. But somehow he penetrated\nnews to us. Because we were not allowed and we had no communication with the outside\nworld at all. There was no radios, nothing. And so we did not -- but we penetrated news in\nthis -- in this respect, that the war started. And also we heard about partisans, but that was\neverything so remote and so away that we did not believe. Here, with the full strength of the\nGerman, they were -- they were constantly on our -- on our back, on our things. We did not\n-- we did not -- we did not know, we just were waiting for a miracle to happen.",
        "A: I heard it after I -- I -- after I read some books, that the first actually dissont was -- was\nthrowing the -- the Soviets -- throwing in the back of my town, Sarnee -- actually the first\ndissont -- are organize a partisan movement, if you understand what I\u2019m saying. To organize\na partisan movement was not far from my city. We heard this, but it did not -- 1t did not\npenetrate to us. We knew that there were POW\u2019s, they were escaping in the woods, but --\nbut it still was not clear. In every little thing was a hope for us, maybe, maybe.",
        "A: To me it was, yes, very much. I was ready to escape from the ghetto, I was ready to go\nand to do some fighting some -- and I saw the brutality and the way they -- the way it\u2019s\nhappening around us, for no reason, no rhyme, no reason. Wrong was wrong and right was\nwrong. In -- in -- in -- in, you know, in anybody who wanted something to d -- to extract\nfrom you, a Ukrainian who was your neighbor and want to extract some -- some things and -\n- and he had the right, with no right for you at all. He can come into your house and say you\ndid so and so and it was not -- it was not done so and so, but he\u2019II say it and he -- you have\nto gi -- bribe him for it. You have to give him some money and I remember a Ukrainian\nonce walked into the house where I lived. We talked him out of it, but we were scared stiff.\nWe knew we got nothing to do with it, he just came for some -- for something just to -- to\nget from us either sacks of money or something, I don\u2019t know. From the -- because the\ngrown up, they were very worried about it. But we talked him out and he left. And so it was\n-- was very tough -- was very tough and especially for young -- for young people, but we\nhad our hopes, maybe, maybe. Because a few times -- but three times before to make the\nreal acts -- aktion, the real killing. There were like a preparatory -- like for instance, all of a\nsudden there, they said all the Jews from the ghetto must come to an appeal and it was on\nYaki -- on Yom Kippur day. And all the Jews came, they came to the marketplace or\nwhatever, they ask us to come to a certain -- to acertain place and then they ask everybody\nto go back home. Do you understand? They wanted us to prepare, if the real thing will\ncome, we should know the difference -- we shouldn\u2019t know the difference, we should just\ncome voluntarily, because they ask us to come. I think twice was an appeal like this and I\nremember my great uncle and it was Yom Kippur and he wore his shawl, he was praying to\nGod and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going. If they wanted, they come to get me,\u201d but this is what --\njust a false appeal.",
        "A: Yes, we lived in that aseparation, til the day came, our ghetto was surrounded by\nUkrainians and German police. A decree right -- there were plac -- placard -- placards, you\nknow, placards? There\u2019s a great word, yeah? Was posted on the unerat, on the consul, that\nthe next day all the Jews must come to -- by the gate of the ghetto. And then penetrated\nmost of us, that that night before, they brought a lot of Jews from some small towns and\nthey brought them into Sarnee. Right away a panic struck all the people. And this morning,\nin the morning, my mother came up, she said, \u201cI want you to go into hiding.\u201d I resisted it\nand I said, \u201cWhat will be with everybody, will be with me.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, maybe let\u2019s try,\nmaybe one of us will survive.\u201d And I remember running with a whole bunch of people --\npeople with -- women with kids in their arms. And live ammunition they were throwing in -\n- into -- s-some of them were killed instantly. And imagine the panic? Again my mother\nresisted and where did I went into hiding, I went to my uncle\u2019s house, who was right by the\nfence, if you jump over the fence, you were already on the outside, on the free -- on the free\nworld, or whatever, the free side. Outside of the ghetto. In a -- my uncle\u2019s -- where my uncle\nlived, they had a barn and they had cows before the war, they used to sell milk or\nsomething. And in that barn, they built a double wall and again, a little opening on the side,\nthey opened this opening and the people walked in and when I walked in they let me in,\nthere were about 12 people already down there. And I always say, because it stands out in\nmy mind horrible, this grandmother, this beautiful old lady was sitting down there, with her\ncherch if I remember, a fine woman. She was asking us questions, what are we sitting in\nhere, why don\u2019t you go out? She did -- was in a raid easily, who knows? And I said we\ndidn\u2019t know the -- the answers for ourselves and not for our grandmother. And the night\nstarted and we heard it\u2019s -- the utifar getauchion, they wanted to burn the ghetto. They said,\n\u201cIf we must go, we\u2019ll burn everything, you know, let\u2019s go all in fire.\u201d And I remember we\nwere sitting behind the wall, we heard some people running right behind in the little alleys,\nright behind -- by n -- by us. Running back, running forth. Nothing materialize. They got,\nyou know, the German find out about this sheme and more reinforcement came. From the\nfire department some reinforcement also, with the barrels of water and things. Nothing came\nof it. In this hold, she had -- that\u2019s was the grandmother, her granddaughter, her son and her\nson\u2019s wife was down there, plus other people in this hiding place. In the morning, he was --\nit was a Mr. Loudier was his name. Mr. Loudier was a very respectable, res -- respected\nbusinessman. He was also in the lumber business, but in another town. And they were\nalready were -- were -- were chased out from that town, Lunenietz, from that town and they\ncame to our town, in the ghetto, in there where they stayed in this -- the grandmother, this --\nthis -- this son, and they --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "A: And in the morning, we wanted to find out what\u2019s -- what\u2019s goings on, so we send -- we\nask this gentlemen -- this Mr. Loudier, the son of this grandmother of ours, we send him, we\nask him, \u201cPlease go and find out.\u201d He went in there to the -- whatever he -- they ask us to\ngather together. He come running back and he was white to his face and he said,\n\u201cEverybody must come out from hiding. Anybody who will be caught hiding will be shot\non the spot.\u201d I heard this and I decided to meet up with my family, but the verdict was the\nsame for the people who stayed behind, for the people who went, the verdict was the same. I\ndecided to meet up with my parents and I came, I met my mother and we c -- we went to the\nassigned -- I remember my mother was ki -- was having a little something, some food, some\nblackberries, dried blackberries, whatever she had in the house. A little -- a little package,\ntwo little packages, that\u2019s all. And I said, walking out from the house, I remember one lady\nacross the -- across from our house, was closing her shutters -- and this will stick out in my\nmind forever. She closed up the shutters and sa -- and she said, \u201cI hope my hands will open\nthe shutters again.\u201d She never saw them back -- she never came back. Because this was the\nend.",
        "A: She was across from our house. But I distinctly remember coming out from our house, I\nheard her saying so in a loud voice. And a lody were desperate, saying, \u201c\u201cWe are doomed.\nIt\u2019s late for us.\u201d And you know, you -- you know even the most desperate times, you just\ndon\u2019t want it to believe, you don\u2019t want it to believe, you think maybe -- maybe somehow,\nsomething will give. And we give into the assigned place and them bastards German, and I\nsaid the same thing before and if you want it. This German had a cart table, like a cart it was\nsquare table I remember. And he had a list of names. He was red to his face when we\nwalked up too closely, he stunk from alcohol. And he was calling out names, alphabetically.\nPutting them in groups. And somebody who was not -- was not there at that moment, he\nused to mark them off. Like you would go someplace for outing or for something -- we\ndidn\u2019t know at the time what was going on. Then we find out. Putting us in groups, taken\nbehind the gate and then right we were surrounded to Germans and Ukrainians. And they\ntook away the people someplace in the outskirts of town. As my name is Schier, my\nmaiden\u2019s name, so you -- I was almost from the end -- to the end, leaving the ghetto. When\nour time came, I remember this little kid was sitting down there. His parents are already\ntaken, he was sitting and crying. And instead of the German was ready to take the pistol and\nkill him, we grabbed this kid and we dragged him along. And we went outside toward the\ngate. I remember this German walking beside me, he stunk with alcohol too. And he had a\narmband, I remember, with a skeleton on it, a black armband. And something with a head of\nsome kind of -- and one of the ladies who were older, she ask him, \u201cWhere are you taking\nus?\u201d She said, \u201cTo a working camp.\u201d He knew exactly where they are taking us.",

        "A: Yeah, the life before the German occupation was fun for us kids. It was -- we were not --\nwe we-were worried -- just worried about our school. We used to get together and in school\nwere the lody -- a lot I remember good times. We had all kind activities and we had the\nfestivities of all kind and we had I remember even lottery. And this was a, you know, s-\nsticks in your mind. And w -- an-and this was -- and it was a lody -- a lody fun we had at b -\n- you know. And it was in contrast of course, in contrast whatever it happened later. It was -\n- it was like a disaster -- it was -- it was completely -- completely the opposite, completely\ndifferent. And that\u2019s -- what can I add more? That\u2019s it.",
        "A: I -- in the ghetto, yeah. When I was in the ghetto? Yeah. We used to get together and we\nused to even -- there was this very s -- very, very -- girl, who went -- she was older than --\nthan I was and she used to s -- read me poetry, she used to discuss some books with me and\nI loved it, to listen to her, she was -- she was older and I looked up to her.

You know, as a kid I did not -- I did not -- not -- I did not question, but I knew\nshe was -- she had all kind of -- but she was very intelligent and very well read and so I used\nto meet her a lot during and in the ghetto actually, when they took us in and down to this\nenclosure, I went up to her and I said, \u201cRun with me.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not leaving my\nmother.\u201d",

You know, we -- in -- the\nfunny part, our own people from our ghetto build that camp. It was double barbed wire from\none side, one -- one barbed wire from the other side, because the Germans were sitting on a\nhill and this was like in a little valley, in a little valley.

We were between si -- 16,000 people, I can be shy a few hundred,\nI don\u2019t know -- 16, 17, I ca -- I don\u2019t know for sure. But they brought in from four or five\nlittle towns, they brought them in at night. And when we -- and when they -- when we\nwalked in to this -- to this enclosure, we saw already dead people. They tried to escape\nduring the night and th-the blood was dried by the barbed wire. They tried to escape at night\nand they killed them right there and then, they never -- they didn\u2019t took away the bodies.\nAnd we had witness all those things. We walked in, we saw it already, that\u2019s the end.",
        "A: At -- not belonging, they say to bring food -- food and some of your precious, you know,\nbecause they wanted to rob us from all those things. No, my mother -- we di -- were not rich\npeople. My mother took a little bit food and that\u2019s it. A little bit what she had and a little to\nfeed three kids down there, I don\u2019t know whatever she had, that\u2019s all. And there is a\nelectrician was in the camp. Was penetrated right through the camp that we are going to cut\nthe barbed wire. I start running around and -- and down there, this German and also 1n the --\nand I always try to emphasize this too. In this sea of hate, we were surrounded. Was down\nthere, this German was a olderly, was my father\u2019s age. They put him down there between\nthe double barbed wire with a gun against us and he -- my friend, who I saw her for the first\ntime, went up to him, he had the right to shoot her right then and then. I was staying behind\nhim. And he looked at her, he looked at me and he said, with tears 1n his eyes, he said, \u201cYou\ndummy, you lowvensay from here. They -- when they toachlowt they will kill you all.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cYou dummy, you. Run from here, they will kill you all.\u201d And tears was rolling\nand he looked at me behind and he said, \u201cMy God, I have a daughter your age. What they\nare doing to you?\u201d But we knew our fate is sealed. Then the electrician smuggled in a\nbarbed wire clipper and there were -- the other guy, Migdal, who was also ordered in, he\nwas tall and blonde and always -- always s-say the same thing. Was tall and blonde. And he\nlooked more Aryan German, like any the Germans that was standing against us. And his\nonly crime was because he was of Jewish faith. Maybe he was from a mixed family, who\nknows? I don\u2019t know. And I always will call him a hero. He was one of the two guys who\nwent and he clipped the barbed wire. But before the clipping of barbed wire, I went up to\nmy mother and -- and -- and I said, \u201cMother, I will run.\u201d She looked at the hill, she looked at\nme and she said, \u201cWhere is the decency of the world?\u201d It was none. And she pointed with\nher finger and she said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll remain alive, you should never, never forget.\u201d And that\u2019s\nmaybe was my promise, if I\u2019ll run out in this hell of hells, Ill fight. And if I have to fight\nand I have to die, I\u2019ll die with a gun in my hand. And at least Pll know that I was fighting\nagainst my enemy.",
        "A: Within hours.",
        "A: Within hours. I remember people start running around. I started going around and I said\nit on the tape before, you know. I start seeing my relatives from the small towns, where they\nbrought them in a night before. And here I came across this pious man, my great uncle was\nsitting on the ground with his whole family and they called alphabetically. They were\nprepared, they were organized, the Germans, the killing squads with their organize. And\nalphabetically they call up their -- their little town was Berishnits. They call up Berishnits\nmust come to the gate. And my uncle was praying down there, sitting. And his daughter sa -\n- was standing down there and she had something on her hand. My mother and I went up to\nher and we ask her, \u201cWhat is this on your -- on your hand?\u201d She said, \u201cThis is my wedding\ngown, this is my fianc\u00e9.\u201d And they got up and they left and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the last I\u2019ve seen\nof them. I went up to my zadee, to my grandfather, who is on the picture and I tell grand --\n\u201cZadee, I\u2019m going to run.\u201d He put I remember his hand on my head and he said, \u201cGod\nshould bless you and help you.\u201d I don\u2019t know, maybe he did.",
        "A: It was a choice between dying or -- or -- o-or running, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t know that I'll\nescape. I thought if they have to get me, they have to get me through -- in the back. So I'll\nwill be dead and if I'll escape, Pll do something. So it was my pure luck.",
        "A: Well, you know, that\u2019s like a -- it\u2019s went through the camp, right away through --\nthrough the camp, went through that we are going to try to cut the barbed wire. So there was\nthis Ger -- this German was standing -- there\u2019s the good German, right to the exnim left and\nthen the Ukrainian. The Ukrainian had to be bribed. And I call him the lackase of the\nGermans. They did all the dirty work for them. They were four smarterer than them and\nthey were my -- my countrymen. We had to give him some trinkets and we told him that we\nneed some water, it was a hot day. And I remember the father of my friend who went to\nschool with me, took off his boot -- a boot and he take to the -- to this Ukrainian and we\u2019 Il\ntell him, \u201cWe\u2019ll bribe you, we\u2019ll give you some -- some gold.\u201d And I remember my mother\ntook off also her ring and put it down there in this little -- in this little packet. And we told\nhim, actually we didn\u2019t want him, we didn\u2019t care. We want him just the -- for time, we were\n-- we were -- we were fighting for time. So then we -- he went away in one -- in the other\ndirection, the barbed wire was cut and then how -- that\u2019s how I ran out from there. And\npeople on top of people were laid -- I actually ran over people, all across, because their own\npeople were standing in between, you understand? From the hill they could not cut us down\nwith the -- with machine guns, because their own people they would murder. So, til they\ncordoned off from around with the -- with the -- with the police and with the -- 1n b -- their\nown people, we had time to escape and that\u2019s how I did.",
        "A: My mother -- my mother saw me running, she threw my sister over and she said, \u201cThere\nis Brenda.\u201d And that\u2019s how my sister survived.",
        "A: I [indecipherable] count how many [indecipherable] maybe in the hun -- a few hundred,\nbut then they were caught. I knew the surroundings, I knew the villages around, so I knew\nwhere to run away from the city. But the people who didn\u2019t, escaped, but they didn\u2019t had\nwhere to escape and they were caught. And I remember while being there in the camp, there\nwas my dentist, who was once a refugee already, she was from --",
        "A: I saw disaster. But I did not until -- I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t think. I did -- I was so\npreoccupied with everything that\u2019s happening around me, I thought horrible. I didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t think straight. So my feeling were -- were -- were mixed and all mixed up anyway.\nAnd I thought that\u2019s the end of humanity. And I remember this doctor, who was a dentist of\nmine, who I used to go with my pitten there to her during -- before the war. She was already\none a refugee, escape from Warsaw, someplace in Mugrafa, I don\u2019t know. And her husband\nwas a doctor. And they have a little boy and while we there in this enclosure, they -- they\nthrow her in like a piece of rag, like a piece of garbage they throw her in -- into our midst\ndown there, in through the gate. And she was sitting on the ground I remember and had a\nlittle -- a little -- a little doctor\u2019s kit -- a little doctor\u2019s kit in her hand. She was sitting and\ntelling, in desperation I remember, sitting in this position and talking like she would talk ab\n-- people surrounded her. She said, \u201cMy husband was killed in front of me. My kid was\nthrown from my hand and throwing against a telephone pole.\u201d And she sod -- she said, \u201cI\nsaw his head was smashed.\u201d And she was sitting in that position and telling us. She said,\n\u201cThere is not -- that\u2019s the end of us.\u201d She said, \u201cI have 12 or 13 needles. Now anybody\nwants to die right away, one I leave for myself and the rest --\u201d And people stood in line.\nAnd this is something not to be forgotten. And -- and there is another incident in the ghetto,\nthere was Dr. Coen, because he was in Sarnee. Very fine doctor and a nice family, they had\none daughter. And he lived for years and years, as long as I remember -- not like the other\none, the other dentist who came, the -- the war, they were down there, local people who\nlived down there for years and years, is. And when he saw what\u2019s happening, the night\nwhen we had to come to this place, the gathering place, he decided to take with his family,\nhis own life. And he had a little food, whatever he prepared, he made a little party, like for\nthemselves and they inject-injected some needles and they die. What -- what --when those\nGermans and the things ran into the house, they find them all dead. And we were told about\nit because in the morning right away, we knew what they did. Some of our friends, they said\nthey tried to escape, their name was Korobotchka. You know it\u2019s funny, sometimes I\nremember the names, gots -- gets into my head and sometimes I just Korobotchka and there\nwas this -- they were also such a fine people. There was a husband and wife, there were\nalready growing children. She was wearing a fur coat and trying to escape from the ghetto.\nAnd on the -- on the fence, they caught her in the sh -- they killed her right on the fence,\nhim and her. And they were hanging half here and half there. And we knew right away\nwhat\u2019s happening. My friend\u2019s father -- we had our toilet outside -- my friend\u2019s father had to\ngo into the bathroom at night. And he went in and one of the police noticed him 1s moving --\na moving object and he gave him straight to his stomach, a bullet. And they brought him on\na stretcher into the gh -- into down there -- to the camp. And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d\nlike he would defend himself. \u201cI just went to the toilet.\u201d They asks a few people to take him\n-- take him across and they killed him right there and then. People who were in the hospital\nand it\u2019s sa -- in the hospital, they all brought them on horse and buggy down there and to\ncome across the hill and they took him down there. They said they had a undressing place.\nAfter I came -- after the war, after it\u2019s -- everything was done -- after I came, I find out all\nabout they made a -- like a tree from -- from a -- like a -- a tree -- like a -- a round -- a tree --\na round thing with one entrance. And in the inside they ask all the people to undress. Some\npeople didn\u2019t wanted to undress. Undressed -- I imagine they wanted still to save the -- the -\n- the clothes from the people to save for themself. To save or to give away or to whatever\nthey wanted to do. So some people decided no, kill us with our clothes. But this was a\nundressing place. Was made out of brick, actually. Like a -- like a -- a -- a round -- a tute --\na round thing and one entrance. And from there they took him by groups and they killed\nhim and they [indecipherable]. Because one of our friend, actually was down there, naked.\nTh-the bullet -- the bullet didn\u2019t got him in between the dead. He ran out, after mart, in the\nevening or -- or something, in the evening. And he ran out in the -- into our -- into our\npeasant house and they gave him some clothes. And he was -- he was actually a hero in the\nwoods. He escaped and he was a friend of my -- of my family. Actually, he helped me.\nShimone Picov was his name. And so -- and so that\u2019s the last moment when I left my\nfamily. I remember my -- my aunt was sitting with her daughter. You know, when I saw the\nSards family, I swear to you, I saw -- I saw them. Because my aunt was sitting down there\non the ground with her kid, my cousin was standing next to her with some more people and\nthey were standing, I don\u2019t think my -- my -- my aunt could understand what I was talking\nto her. I just observed, I looked at them and I went my way.",
        "A: I -- we lost my father. Maybe he went because he spoke German, maybe he went, maybe\nhe start a fight with some of the guards, I don\u2019t know. We lost him an-and he -- we don\u2019t\nknow, maybe he killed him right then and there.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t -- my father -- we lost my father. Maybe he stayed behind, he le -- he\nstayed behind, or he went with us. I think -- I know he -- he went and then he disa -- we\ndon\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t know, he disappeared.",
        "A: Maybe he never made it to the camp in the first place, I don\u2019t know. Or maybe he go --\nstarted a argument with some of a German. Or he ask him some questions and they would\nkill and they killed him right there and then.",
        "A: My father, I remember my father was there. But then -- then I was -- I was surrounded\nwith my mother, my brother, my sisters and I didn\u2019t remember, maybe my father was -- was\ndown there someplace. You know, because each one -- it was such a confusion, such a\nhorrible thing, 1t was a mess. It wa -- it was not -- not something -- something -- we saw it, it\n-- it\u2019s something tragic, something horrible. And I will never forget this son of a gun went\nwith me, this -- S-Sahartski was his name. We went in the same school than I -- than I did.\nAnd he had a lot of friends -- of Jewish friends and -- and he was older -- older than us. But\nalways he tried to -- to be friendly and this and that. When the Germans came, he joined this\nevil cause and he became a policeman and he was standing with a gun. I came up to him and\nI wanted to go to the bathroom. And he said, \u201cGet away or I\u2019Il kill you right there and then,\nPl kill you.\u201d And this rage I said, \u201cOh God. If I will get him.\u201d So that\u2019s were the moment.\nAnd my feelings were mixed. You ask me, I don\u2019t know. I felt horrible. I felt disillusioned,\nenchanted, enchant? Disen -- dis --",
        "A: Disenchanted. That the whole thing was surrounding us. People we live for centuries all\nof a sudden became criminals. I\u2019m at 16, was in there. I was a criminal, for what reason,\nwhat was my crime? We were decent, nice people, we are beasically to our life\u2019s daily life,\npreoccupied to make a living, to -- to do the right thing and all of a sudden, because of a --\nof a distraught man, and he had the power, but the people who helped him and the rest of\nthe world did not makes any -- didn\u2019t say a thing. That was the horrible, horrible thing.\nEngland was quiet. And they paid a price afterwards. Which one -- we had to -- we had to\nget in it to war, because between two evils, they were -- they were the biggest. We had to be\nanyway in the war -- get into the war. And if they would knock down Hitler before he\nacquired so much power, this catastrophe would never taken place.",
        "A: [ran out -- I ran out each for only sil -- I remember with a -- with a group of t -- of two\nboys and girls. I ran out, I stepped over people and some -- some the blood went out -- was\non me. And I ran to -- my first instinct, to go in this church, in this Catholic church. But I\nran up and I said, \u201cWe are -- they can see us. Where can we hide down there?\u201d And I\nproceeded to run. I proceeded to run, my mother saw me, she pushed my sister, she threw\nher over the barbed wire, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s Brenda.\u201d And she was running behind me and\nshe was all bloody. Her little shirt -- it was a hot day there and you know my instinct, I was\nso -- I was so, you know, mixed up. My instinct first -- we said, \u201cThey will recognize.\u201d She\nwas all bloody, I said, \u201cShe\u2019ll recognize she\u2019s Jewish because her blood is on the shirt.\u201d And\nI took off the shirt and I throw away in a -- ina yard and I ran. And I ran to our friendly\nfamily, where they are, our good friends, they are Polish people and we did a lot of good\nthings for them. Actually my mother was instrumental for them not to go to Siberia. And\nthey said -- they used to call my mother their daughter. So the fir -- instinct, the first thing I\nwould run to them, they were not far from down there. I run up to the house and the lady, I\nask her, \u201cPlease give us some water.\u201d Simma was behind me, my sister Simma. She gave us\nsome water -- said, \u201cHide us.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d I couldn\u2019t understand.

But that -- that\nfenced-in little yard and I opened th-the -- the door and I walked in and then her husband,\nwith a whole bunch of his friends, some Poles, some Ukrainians, standing in a half circle\nand telling jokes. And it struck me horrible. They saw -- do you understand they could hear\nthe -- the shots? I don\u2019t know that was -- they knew right or mairment or they didn\u2019t know,\nbut when they saw us, this -- this husband of this -- this and of lat -- some of the people I\nknew too. They scow when I dis -- th-they stac -- they stopped in their tracks and they\nlooked at us because we looked like -- like wild animals. Like -- like something escape,\nwounded animals. I was barefooted, my sister were -- was barefooted, half naked.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what the jokes were all about. When they saw us they stopped the jokes at\nonce. I looked at them, they looked at us and I we -- I went out from down there.",
        "A: They turned -- I could understand they were afraid because they could as -- they could\nhave killed them and us together. So my sister was right behind me. I ran in the direction\nwhat I knew where they used to go to my grandparents and we lived also, not far from town,\nwhere we had a grocery, my father worked as a -- as a selector of woods. And so I knew and\nmy sister was behind me, you know, wussup, and I lost my sister. I lost her. I didn\u2019t had\nthe time, I was birf, I was all alone. I didn\u2019t had the time to look for her, I lost her and I said,\n\u201cShe will come somehow.\u201d And I went all by myself. I was afraid to go through the bridge,\ndown there was a bridge. We had a little -- a river sloot. I was afraid to go over the bridge\nbecause maybe some patrol or maybe some policeman with guns, they are standing and they\nwill kill me right there and then. So I went through the water and down there a shepherd\nboys was standing, so I ask him, because we had some -- some -- some -- some -- what --\nthe water, you know, the water -- what do we call it, you know, the -- like -- they -- they had\nsome things in the -- in the water that can grab you in. Kettle? Water kettle?",
        "A: Like a whirlpool. Like a whirlpool?",
        "A: Like a whirlpool. And you have to know because down there it\u2019s -- there were places\nwhere there is those whirlpools and they suck you in. So I ask the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, how do you spell it? Okay, so I went -- I was afraid to go on the bridge, I went\nthrough -- the shepherds guys told me where to go through because down there are these\nwhirlpools, so I went by and I went on the other side, I was all alone. And I went and I was\nwaiting up til dark. Dark, I proceeded my journey and I remember some Ukrainians were\ncoming from -- from the city and I heard them talking about what they are doing, they are\nkilling all -- all of the Jewish people and they were a little bit with sorrow in there, I could\nhear by their voices. But they were the -- but they were about their own business. I went into\nthe village where my grandparents lived and I knew the -- her neighbor was a very good\nfriend of them, so I went in and I knew I had to go in through the back yard, nobody should\nsee me. I tapped on the -- on the -- on the window and he opened the door. On the door\nactually I tapped, he opened the door, I went in and who did I find? My sister and my uncle.\nIt was like fiction.",
        "A: My uncle escaped the same time I did. And he ran also to the same, because we knew\nthis -- this man was a very decent and nice Christian man. Nice, fine man and a good friend\nof ours. My sister, when I lost her, she met up with my cousin and another distant cousin\nwhat I lived in the ghetto, with a group of men who escaped and were going in the same\ndirection. And she came right across the dam and they took her along. And when they\nbrought her to the village, they said, \u201c\u201cThis man 1s a nice man, go into him -- go into his\nhouse.\u201d And that\u2019s how we met, all three of us. And the rest of the people, they went -- they\nwent -- my grandfather had a -- a mill, a windmill, what you use to make flours, in the\noutskirts of the village. So my cousin -- you know, I don\u2019t know how many there were, but\nfour or five men, they went to this windmill and they were hiding down there for days and\nthen they went into the woods.

She was a real good human being. I lived in that village for a little while. And there\nwas some good people down there, too. But there was some nasty ones too, you know. Went\nalong the easy way and they thought they\u2019ll have a paradise, they didn\u2019t. The promises\nHitler will gave them, were never delivered to them. He just exploitated them to do the dirty\njob and then he went about his business. He made them his policemen, he promised them\nthe Ukraine to give them, he never delivered them. He never gave it, he never -- when he\nfelt it that they are -- were a little bit stronger, he took away the ammunition from them. And\nthen a lot of them went -- went also into the underground.",
        "A: In that village, a short while. I was working a few months, I would say. Maybe not even\nthat long. And I decided to go deep into the woods. I heard that Shimone Picov was -- who\nescaped from the graves like I told you. From the graves, actually, he was wounded very\nslightly. In it -- in the evening he got out from under the dead people and he escape and\npeople -- peasant people gave him some clothes. And I decided to go into the dup-deep\nwoods [indecipherable] Russia. They have a lot of swamps and deep woods. And we had a\ninkling already that\u2019s partisans. They\u2019re and here, we didn\u2019t know where and what, but we\nknew that they are organizing and they are -- they are -- they are grouping themselves in\ngroups. So I decided Ill go down there or I\u20191l meet up with some other people like myself.\nAnd -- but in this village I worked for a woman who used to make sweaters, I remember.\nShe was so nice to me. And she could not understand the politics and all this nonsense. And\nshe said, \u201cWhy they wanted to kill you?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know mys -- I don\u2019t know.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cWhy -- if they will come to kill you, they will have to kill me too.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\ndon\u2019t want you to be killed on account of me.\u201d But she was a good soul. Sh -- I used to\nmake sweaters, knit for them sweaters and work and be in hiding. And I looked like a\npeasant girl. I spoke the language well, so -- an-and she was -- and she used to tell them that\nI\u2019m from another village, whatever.",
        "A: My sister was there, yes. Yes.",

And then we decided one night to go to -- into the deep woods and to meet up\nwith this Shimone -- Shimone Picov and whatever group he is. And it\u2019s easier now to tell\nthan it happened.",
        "A: My sister was with me, yes, but we heard that Shimone escaped and he was from a\nvillage, he knew the village people and he was something -- some -- some -- I wanted to\nmeet him because he knew our family. Why, I cannot explain, but I knew our family -- I\nknew he knew the village people and I thought maybe he\u2019Il be some kind of protector and I\nwas right in some ways. So one evening we decided we are going at night, dark at night we\ndecided we are going to that village. And this was like 10 kilometers from that destination.\nAnd I start going by a little creek, a little creek I went. At night it was dark, dark at night\nand at night you don\u2019t d -- I hear the barking of the -- of the -- of the -- the dogs all around\nme and they are -- they\u2019re on -- then there, you know, like farmhouses. A farmhouse\nsurrounded with the -- with the field -- what they -- what they harvest, potatoes and all those\nthings. And each farmhouse had around, you know -- doe each separated from the other,\nlike in here, too, separate farms. And I heard the dogs sunna -- in -- in -- at night. I -- we\nwent around in circle, twice. And I saw it, now we have to take the creek. The creek will\ntake us out someplace. And my sister and myself started walking by the creek and I heard, at\nnight, in the dark night, I heard some people washing their hands on the other side. Washing\ntheir hands and I almost woke -- start blabling out, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d And then I said, \u201cLet\nme be quiet -- let me -- let me think. Let me hear more words, what they are saying.\u201d They\nwere thieves, coming from the other village, who were tilling out honey from the hives,\ntilling out honey and some other stuff they were -- they were, you know, they were stealing\nfrom the village people, but actually, my family lived down there -- and they were coming\nback home. I don\u2019t know -- and one said to the other one, after washing their hands, \u201cLet\u2019s\nget up and let\u2019s go because it\u2019s daybreak, is going to be and somebody will see us.\u201d I don\u2019t\nknow if I would talk to them, maybe they would let us go because we were almost on the\nsame level like with them, they were -- we were criminal. You understand, they knew that\nwe wouldn\u2019t talk against them. I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the chance I didn\u2019t wanted to take.\nThey washed their hands, they took this -- the -- the -- the -- grabbed their things and they\nwent back where they -- where their homes were, before daybreak.",
        "A: I knew Karasin, I knew that I\u2019m going the direction of Karasin. And when Ill go out and\nthe creek took me out. You know, you learn fast. He says, \u201cHow did you learn to fight?\u201d\nYou learn fast. You -- the creek took us out to this -- to this highway, a little highway, it\u2019s\nnot a highway like we -- anything here -- to this highway and we knew this will take me to\nKarasin. During the day we -- I remember we went in -- into the woods, we hide ourselves\nfor some pe -- people who are coming or going somep -- they shouldn\u2019t spotted us. And at\nnight we proceeded. It took us two days til we arrived in Karasin. And I remember the first\nhouse we walked in, the woman cried when she saw us. She said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d My feet\nwere bloody, you know from -- from the scratching in the field with -- I was running around\nand it was already August, late August. And -- and she was crying actually, the woman. She\ngave us some -- some shoes from leek, like in the Roman times. What we make the shoes\nfrom leek, she gave us some shoes from leek to me and my sister and she showed me how to\nwear them. You put -- you put string in them and you wear them like -- in the Roman time,\nlike the sandals, but this is -- the Romans was fancier, but this was very primitive. But you\nwear them in the winter, with some rags and then you put us -- those shoes and she taught us\nhow to -- this is my first experience too, at that time. So --",
        "A: I lost them on the way, yeah. So this is the leek, what she told me, it was torn up, you\nknow, the man actually, from the village gave me, from Cartpelufka, the good man what let\nus in, he gave me also, but then I didn\u2019t know how to do it and this, the woman who actually\ntaught me, this is the way you do it, this the way you do it. And that -- she taught me how to\n-- to wear them properly. So, and I used to wear them during, you know -- til I went in --\ninto the -- into the partisans.",
        "A: Yeah, on the journey, I -- took me a few days. And I remember going into that village\nand asked right away Shimone, ou said, \u201cOy, Shimone is in the woods someplace.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cWhere in the woods, the woods are big, where in the woods?\u201d \u201cSomeplace.\u201d So I\nslapped over to this woman, who actually taught me how to wear the leek shoes and she\nsaid, \u201cGo across this swamp and down there into -- in the woods, you\u2019ll find him\nsomeplace.\u201d And in the swamp, you have to know what you\u2019re doing, if not you can sink\ndown there in a -- in a quicks -- in -- in a quicksand? In quick -- quicks -- you know, it\u2019s not\nsand, but that\u2019s the -- the swamp actually grabs you in. You have to know what you are\ndoing, you have to go just by the path, not to stroll right, not to stroll left. And she told us,\nthe woman told us. We went -- it took us about three kilometers, we went into the woods\nand when we came right in the outskirts of the woods, with all like teepee. Teepeetel, like\nthe Indians. From straw, but in our -- 1n our country was made from straw. And we saw\nright away and then there were barns. We saw them -- there\u2019s shepherd guys, must be\nshepherd guys. Because there were bottles, there were the teepeetel, the teepee from -- from\nstraw. And I walked in with my sister and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d 1t was daytime. I saw and I --\nand I felt the ashes and they were warm. \u201cWay,\u201d I say, \u201cthere are people here.\u201d I gots -- you\nknow it was -- made me feel good. You know, it was -- 1t was -- 1t was in the woods. And I\nsaid, \u201cOh, it\u2019s some people in here.\u201d So I, \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d But let\u2019s wait, we were hungry and\nwe had nothing to drink, nothing to eat. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a village man and maybe he\u2019 Il\ngive us some food.\u201d And we strolled away a little bit farther and there was a guy who had\nhis farm right in -- deep in the woods. And he was putting up a stack of hay, him and his\ntwo sons, with -- with -- with some, you know, with some tools. We went up and I said to\nmy sister, \u201cYou stay.\u201d You know, we were af-afraid of the -- of the light, we were. You\nknow, I said, \u201cYou stay here in case something happen, I want you to know. I\u2019ll go in, I'll\ntalk to them.\u201d I came up not -- not too close, I came within a distance, also I should be able\nto ran if they will have some bad intention against me. And I start asking him if there 1s\nShimone Picov. He said, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s someplace in the woods, with a lody more Jews,\u201d\nhe said. I said, \u201cWe are hungry and I would like you to give us some food.\u201d And he start\ngiving me a lecturing, why don\u2019t I go back to the city, why don\u2019t I give myself up to the\nGermans? I got so -- I got so upset. You know as -- as young as I was, I understood and I\nlooked at this specimen of a human being and I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t came here for advice, I\u2019m\nhungry and I want some food, if you can help us with that.\u201d I said, \u201cIf you bore to church, if\nyou do something,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know about your tomorrow.\u201d And I said it to him.\nAnd he -- \u201cTI -- I'll send you some food,\u201d but we didn\u2019t trust him. I said, \u201cWho knows,\nmaybe he\u2019ll come out with a gun, he\u2019Il try to sh -- to kill us both.\u201d We stayed in -- within a\ndistance and there a guy came out, a guy who was a forester -- was watching over the forest.\nAnd he was friendly to us, he brought us the food, he gave us and we ate and at night we\ncame back to this teepeetel. Why\u2019d we came back -- so I still had very, very, very carefully -\n- before I went in I said, \u201cSimma,\u201d to my sister, \u201clet me listen who are the ke -- who are the\nguys and who are the --\u201d I looked in through the -- through down there a little hole --\npeephole -- and I see there are two shepherd guys laying and down there a guy with a\nsweater with a little boy laying next to him. And I said, \u201cThis must be a Jewish man. Also\nescaped like we did. But if,\u201d I said, \u201cif he\u2019s Jewish he\u2019ll say something, avort from his sleep\nor something.\u201d We were listening -- we\u2019re standing there for hours and then actually it\nhappened. He said something to the little boy and I right away I ran in and I got him by\nsurprise and I said to him -- and I knew the family -- I knew the family, they also were used\nto -- friends of my parents. I said, \u201cWhere is Shimone Picov?\u201d And I told him who I was.\nHe said, \u201cOh, Shimone Picov, he doesn\u2019t want kids, he doesn\u2019t want nobody else, we are a\nbig group and it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going. You take us to Shimone Picov,\nand Shimone Picov will say we should not come, we should be away, we\u2019ll go.\u201d But in\nmeantime I wanted to go and see Shimone Picov. He wanted to get out of the w -- you\nknow, the dealvy task, but I insisted and I went alone -- and I went and I said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and\nPll find him anyway.\u201d So he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He took me with my sister, we came to this\ncamp, there were about 30 -- 30 Jews o-or something, 30 or maybe 35, I don\u2019t know. Also\nescaped the same -- the same day of the same -- from different part of the -- of the -- of the -\n- of the country. And they wind up down there in -- in this -- in the woods. Where is\nShimone? Shimone is going out, he\u2019s like scouting out. And he\u2019s trying to get a -- a gun. At\nnight Shimone came, he had already a gun and I came up to him with my sister and I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m the daughter of so and so.\u201d Tears are rolling from my -- from his eyes and he said,\n\u201cThey are like my children and they are going to stay here.\u201d And he was -- when he said it\nwas -- it was the law. He was the leader of the group. He used to take us and then he used to\nwatch over us. Let\u2019s say he would stay two days in this destination, he would take us to\nanother -- to another destination. We should not sit in the same place, we should not be\nsurrounded by some enemy and be s -- and be massacred. And while I was down there, I\nused to go to the village and work for the people in the fields and get some potatoes and\nbring some potatoes in the -- 1n the -- in the -- in the woods. And I was no obstacle, the\nopposite, I was a help. So I went to the village, I used to work and at night I used to bring\nhim potatoes and he will feed -- give to some food to some other people. And one day -- and\nthis 1s -- I -- amashamont -- one day arrived down there a teacher, supposedly. From the city\nof Sarnee, where I came from. The teacher came and he announced down there to the -- to\nthe -- to the head of the village, that he -- he was sent by the government to organize a\nschool. Do you imagine the killing was going on, the war was -- was -- was going on and all\nof a sudden the Germans are preoccupied to open a school in this particular village? The\nnews penetrated to us, we find out very fast and we knew that something is fishy about tt.\nWe have to watch this stranger, what his intentions and what he\u2019s going to do. Within a few\ndays he was asking all kind of questions and everyb -- and everything was -- was brought to\nour -- to our attention, because the -- the guy who -- the man -- the village man where he s-\nstayed with them, he was a friend of ours. And he went back to the -- to Sarnee, it was like\n15 kilometers from that place on. And came back -- at that time it was unheard, because the\nGermans would have killed him, because they would think that he 1s a -- a spy for the -- for\nthe -- for the partisans and all of a sudden he\u2019s going free there and back. And we knew\nright away that the Germans are send -- send him in to -- to find out if there are some Jews\nthere or some partisans and what the movement and what\u2019s going on down there. And we\nknew we have to get rid of this -- this -- the German. Picov was instrumental. At night he\nwalked in with another guy and they got rid of him. And he couldn\u2019t go no more there and\nback. Then --",
        "A: My sister was with me at this time, yes.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: 35, maybe 40, I -- I don\u2019t even count how many -- but I remember a group.",
        "A: Yeah, definitely.",

        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No w -- no way.",
        "A: No way. No way we felt wrong. No way we felt we are wrong at all. After we saw and\nwe saw what they -- what some of their allies -- some of the lackase I call them. My -- my --\nmy countrymen were doing for -- for -- for silly thing -- for some trinkets. The Germans\nwould give them a watch to kill somebody. Was no -- not at all. We knew he was a spy and\nwho knew he was doing some bad things. And he was not jus-just a danger to the Jewish\npeople, but for the whole village people. They would come and they would -- they would\nmake a parking ou -- a nothing out of the village. They would massacre with no hesitation at\nall, the Germans. You understand? So there was no buts and no doubts. But this was not\nenough for me, I wanted to join up a big group and I wanted actually to go and fight. And\nwhile I was down there in the woods, my sister was a shepherd girl, down there working\nand I was looking for somebody and all of a sudden, they say a big group of partisans are\npassing by and I went for curiosity to see, I said maybe, you know, maybe. They di -- just\ndon\u2019t take you in just because you -- you say -- you are there. You know, you have to want\nit, they question you, they ask you. And while we are standing down there, a big group of\npartisan on horses, with guns, with machine guns. With this they are coming -- coming -- I\nliked it -- I said, \u201cOh this is -- this is something great -- this 1s something to fight with.\u201d And\nright away there is this officer, I saw he\u2019s a officer, because people were wearing noth-noth\n-- not uniform, they were partisans, they were all a potpourri, with all kind of clothes,\ncivilian clothes, not civilian clothes, anybody -- whatever you had, they had it. But this --\nthis -- this command -- this officer had a -- had a uniform. And we saw by his -- by his\ncoming across to us, that he is some kind of ranking officer. So he came up to us and I was\nstanding there with another girl and we exchanged some niceties and I said to him -- I was\nthe brave one, I said, \u201cI wanted to go in and fight with you.\u201d I said, \u201cWould you fight?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cOh, yes. You'll teach me, I'll fight.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not in authority tell you yes and\nno.\u201d He went back to his general -- and he was actually the -- next to the general, the\ncommissar they call him. Politic-Political advisor at that time. Commissar -- it was a\npolitical advisor. He went to the general, he came back and he said, \u201cIf you wanted to come,\nif you\u2019 ll fight.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNow or never.\u201d I decided right there and then I\u2019m going. But\nI had to let words to my sister. That\u2019s how I went. I said to some of the peasants, I wasn\u2019t\nsure they\u2019 ll tell her or not tell her, she\u2019ll think that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the end of me. Anyway, I went\nwith some -- a few more Jewish girls, we went and we -- we stationed by 10 kilometers\nfrom that destination where I started, where it was like my home state on there. Where it\nstarted it, it was like 10 or maybe 50, I don\u2019t know exactly, but this is the distance. Down\nthere we stopped, in that village, for at night and I was assigned to a group. I went right\naway to my commanding officer, I told him that I left a sister. And I told him she doesn\u2019t\nknow where I am and she -- she\u2019 Il think that I am already killed. \u201cWhat is your advice?\u201d I\nask him, \u201cWhat do you s -- what do you think?\u201d He says to me -- he thought for awhile and\nhe says to me, \u201cYou know what? Maybe we can solve the problem. I\u2019Il give you my horse.\u201d\nSomething -- he liked something about me -- a very fine man. \u201cIll give you my adjutant. Go\nback to your sister and tell her that you are in a fighting unit now.\u201d I went back with this\nadjutant and he was sumpalese attatar -- attatar. And he told me some stories that was\nfascinating to me at that time. We exchanged slice, the -- we exchanged jokes and these and\nI told him about my life. And it was such a camaraderie right away. And -- and he said,\nthere\u2019s four barriers, you know, he said_ that they were -- they were, you know, sculpcatters\nor something, four barriers, [indecipherable] on their back, you know, he said -- and it was\nSo -- you know, it was funny. And we came to the destination where my sister was, to the\nhouse where actually I lived in the deep woods, I walked up -- I got off now -- he gave me\nhis horse, he showed me the first time -- showed me how to mount the horse and that\u2019s was\nmy first encounter. I mounted the horse, I went with him and we proceeded til we came to\nthe -- the house. I walked up to the vil -- to the woman -- to the -- to the housekeeper -- to\nthe -- to the hostess of the house where my sister and I lived. My sister was someplace with\nthe cattles, sh -- as a shepherd girl. I walked up to her and [indecipherable] \u201cShe\u2019s the only\none,\u201d I said to her. \u201cNow you are responsible for her, I\u2019m going to fight. Now you\u2019re\nresponsible. If something will happen to her, remember, I\u20191l come for revenge.\u201d I didn\u2019t\nhave to say nothing more. I said, \u201cIll burn your house with no hesitation and Ill take your\nlife.\u201d And -- and it was straight to the point. She knew it exactly because she knew it. And\nthey were anyway on our side -- on our side. I left there and I came back to my -- to my\nunit.",

And we had to pass by my city and somehow the orders,\nI didn\u2019t know about it, the orders came that we are going to go and my general came up to\nme, he said, \u201cBrennaslava,\u201d he used to call me Brennaslava. He used to call me\nBrennaslava, you know, in Russian. \u201cBrennaslava, we are going -- maybe we\u2019ll go into your\ncity.

We had to surv pass -- we had to g -- pass by the city of Sarnee.\nWe never went in, we went in on our destination because you know, it\u2019s not written in stone\nduring the war, it changes from minute to minute and the orders and everything because the\nstrategic point and thing and the fights and the retreating of the army and all those things.\nOne thing I know, we gave them hell.

        "A: I would say 10 percent.",
        "A: Maybe so, maybe more. I don\u2019t -- something. I had always my friend Taska, she was like\na tomboy. She -- I always have a good feeling about her. Taska, I used to go right all -- al-\nalways with her. And the guys, oh they would not bu-budge with her. She used to give them\nhell, straight. From start to the end. But we had about 10 percent and her sister -- she was\nmarried, oh -- that\u2019s why her fianc\u00e9 -- she fell in alive to the German hands. And this was a\ntragedy. Because alive -- or maybe she killed herself because every partisan was encouraged\n-- they have a grenade with him, in case he fell ins the Germans, he should kill himself.\nBecause we knew that they will ki -- cu -- not just they will -- they will torture you to death,\nthey will want extract some information. But you didn\u2019t know and if you knew -- if you\nknow the information, you wouldn\u2019t give them. Do you understand? There was a -- a very\nvicious circle.

        "A: We did. Very fast ones.

Other time -- but anyway, he was showing us how to ride or take a lower part, to\ngo fast or to go slow, whatever. And then we used to have targets, what we used to --\nshooting targets, actually we sh -- came down there and we used to -- we used to train\nourselves. It was not too long, but it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s not a big theory, you know soon, but you have\nto do it, you do it fast. If your life -- 1f your life is at stake, you understand? You do it. Or\nyou do it or you die, one of those two things. There was no -- nothing -- nothing in between.\nAnd because I choose life, maybe I\u2019m here still.

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, no. It depends in the group where I stood on watch or I stood on watch or I had to\npull the trigger or whatever it 1s, 1t was nothing. That was -- you know -- the guys there\nwere more -- more -- knew -- knew more, so they went ahead, where they were already\nexperienced in this particular thing, they were went ahead. If I had to go, I went with him.\nLet\u2019s say if you had to put the -- we used to call TNT on the -- the railroad, like little\nsquares, TNT? This is -- you know -- and then were a detonator or we used to make -- very\nprimitive, with a long string and then you put a -- a -- you put a -- a match and then it\u2019s goes\nand it\u2019s explodes. But we used to do it in three, four places, because the Germans would --\nwould put it back -- the rails -- in one, two, three, you understand?

        "A: By acquiring, by going -- you are people with guns. You go in, nobody would say no to\nyou.",
        "A: Yeah, there is some instances what we did, but mostly no, because there are --sometimes\nwe used to go parallel with the Germans and this was a no-no, we\u2019re not allowed.

We used to go\nparallel, they would go on the -- on the highway, we would go parallel in the woods. And I\nknow for a fact and I said it in -- down there I think on the tape. I know it. The Germans\nwere afraid they went to go in to relieve themself in the woods. Because they knew that\nsomething is awaiting them. They used to be scared of the eastern front like hell, because\nthey knew the damage they were -- they had done to the people and what kind of hatred we\nhad against them. So, this is what my -- my reward against them.",
        "A: Well for instance -- a for instance, yeah, the radio operator, they had three -- they had\nthree people were working constantly radio. There were demolition, you know, what you go\ninto -- then -- they were sending each time another group or another people or sometimes\nthe same, it depends, because we were moving constantly. A -- for an instance, we were in\nthe -- we occupied a village -- let me give you a s -- a example so you -- you understand the\nmagnitude. We occupied a village. I was in the group at that time, who -- we occupy a\ncertain destination. You put 1n a -- you put it in a -- on the entrance of the village and the\nexit of the village or -- or both entrances of the village, you put it in like a machine gun, a\nguns, a few -- a few sentries, a machine gun and you allowed people to walk -- to get into\nthe village, but nobody\u2019s allowed to get out from the village. And I remember we occupied\none village in -- it was on the -- on -- on the eastern -- not far from Shitoma. Someplace not\nfar from -- in that direction. And we walked in -- it was -- our village was in the valley and -\n- and it was surrounded with little hills. And somebody must -- if the Germans find out -- in\nthe morning we were surrounded from the hills by the Germans and they have the better\nposition on us, because we were in the valley, we were in the -- on the -- on the bottom. As I\nwas at -- razvere -- no -- right, yeah. So I -- we needed some ammunition to get. The surplus\nof ammunition was down there, like three or four houses away. We used to get it in the\nhorse and buggy, on wagons, you understand? It was not suffish to get at now. This on\nhorse and buggy, it was on wagons. So the -- we needed, for the machine gun, we needed\nsome bullets. And -- and our commanding officer said, \u201cI need the bullets.\u201d You know, we\nsaw it already, surrounded by the Germans. And I said, \u201cI know exactly how to go the back\nway and I\u2019ll go.\u201d And I went the back way, I went out down there to the horse and buggy, I\ngot the ammunition, I got the -- the -- the -- a whole big bag of ammunition, of the bullets\nfor the -- for the -- for the machine gun and by coming back, already the houses, where I had\nto go to hide myself -- to -- to crawl under them, was already burning. The -- the -- because\nwe have straw in our country, that\u2019s straw on the -- on the -- on the -- on the thing. So right\naway they put it in, they -- they throw in some bullets, it starts a fire. In the straw it started\nright there and then. So when I was coming back with the bullets, already each house was\non fire. I ran in and I remember I tumbled under the -- the house with my -- with my bullets\ntrawling behind -- grabbing, schlepping like with me. And I walked up and I had to go from\none -- from one house to another one. I tumbled again, I went in and down there I saw my\npartisan friend. Ivania was his name. I yelled to him, he was laying -- because I recognized\nhim by his -- by his -- by his -- by his dress, by his red jacket, a shepherd jacket -- in sh-\nsheepskin jacket. So I recognize -- I said, \u201cIvania, cover me, it\u2019s me, we should start\nshooting and I can go by.\u201d He didn\u2019t responded to me and I got mad and I start yelling at\nhim because I thought he\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s co -- y-you know, a coward there -- he -- he\u2019s --\nhe\u2019s scared. But Ivania was dead. A sniper got straight to his head, because the next day was\nthe funeral. Anyway, I tumbled through it, I went down through a well.

They said it also. He\nsighted ee, my -- my -- my officer -- when he -- when I came in, I brought them in there.\nAnd one time my general told me, \u201cBrenda, you\u2019ll live a long life.\u201d And I say always,\nmaybe he predicted right.",

        "A: So when I came back, he said it, you will live a long life. Wesided because I pinched\nmyself and I ran into the woods. And then we had to retreat. We had to -- we had to deceive\nthe Germans too, in any way we could. So we came, the fight ended a few hours and then a\nplane came. We used to call it the Rama and this is like a -- a frame plane. And this -- the\nframe plane used to take -- used to take pictures of the terrain and of us and of moving\nthings and we knew it -- this -- this plane will go away within a f -- an hour or two, we\u2019ll\nhave bombs on our heads. So we have to skedoodle, we have to get out from there very fast.\nSo we left some old rags, I remember at that time, some old horses, some old things what\nthey could not be taking with us, to pretend that we are still down there and we moved out.\nAnd I remember there was big opening, a big clearing in the woods. They asked the\npartisans to go backwards, like -- like to step backwards. They should -- when he comes\nwith the plane to -- to take a look, so they see these people get in, but not out. But actually\nwe -- this was our deceiving them. And we went around the clearing. And after -- and after\nin a few hours, the bombs came. We asked the people of the village -- we told them -- we\nwarned them, everybody run for your life, because they will be on your backs. And it was\nthat way, within a few hours. The planes were there and they made a mess out of the village\nand the people who were -- who were down there left over, they were all dead. And we were\nbehind them. We were spectators. We were standing in the woods far away and we were\nseeing the whole -- the whole thing, the whole happening, what\u2019s happened. I remember\nstanding next to Taska, you must remember Taska -- Taska. I was standing down there and\nwas still -- was a happening. There was this -- Varla was her name, one from the radio\nstation. She used to write a daily -- dai -- a -- a nievnik we call it, you know, a -- a diary.\nAnd -- and it struck me at one point very funny because here we are fighting anee. I used to\nask her -- Varla -- we -- we liked each other and I said, \u201cVarla, do you think we will read --\nwe will live through to see it?\u201d She said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I think we will.\u201d I said, \u201cI\nhave hopes we will.\u201d And she did.

There were boys and you know, I was\nattractive, I would say. I tried, you know, to be. I pushed away. I said it\u2019s not the time, it\u2019s\nnot the place to get involved in what\u2019s then.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, maybe there were some. I -- I -- on assignments, I remember the first time\nthe general -- I was -- was riding 1n the -- 1n this group and he send me -- I didn\u2019t know even\nit was such a dangerous -- a mission. He send me to another village, then th -- he told me a\nname, so and so and so. He gave me some -- a piece of paper, then I -- I had to bring him\nsome information from down there. Even I came back, I was so shy in dahell, I was shy. I\nhad to report to him. I was standing behind the door, I remember, til I walked in and I said,\n\u201cYou know, my mission\u2019s accomplish in this.\u201d And it was a dangerous mission because,\nyou know, I was all alone and somebody could ambush me, it could be the end of me.

I had to be like a warning shot, if somebody comes in, I should give a warning\nshot to them. And I stood on there for a few hours and it was, you know, I get chills in my\nback. You understand? Because I was afraid it\u2019s not just so -- that somebody from a tree\nshould jump on me, you understand? Bu -- sh -- ch -- somebody from a tree should jump on\nme and overpower me. Not because -- because I was ready with my gun, I was ready to s --\nto -- to take my position -- to do whatever I had to.

And there were guys, they are brave -- they are -- they were\nfighters -- they were -- they -- I know we paved the way to liberation. We paved the way.\nAnd in the eyes of the military, we looked like heroes to them. I didn\u2019t know even, at that\ntime. We looked -- be-because they knew we were volunteers, we went to fight -- fight them\nto the end. And we did and they\u2019re af -- they\u2019re afraid of us like -- they used to send\ndivisions to get the partisan -- to find the partisans. They never did. Of course we had a lody\nof -- of -- on our side too, a lody -- a lody, y-you know, whatever you say -- of fallen\nsoldiers, some were -- were without legs, some without -- hand.

And take away our ammunition and then\nwe came to the city of Rovno and then there, we gave our ammunition and each one -- they\nask what -- our whole commission of people, they ask who wants to do what. I thought for a\nstrangid idea to go in to take some languages and to go to college, where they would -- to go\nto the university, but they would have helped me at that time.",
        "A: From the partisan headquarters. They would have helped me because I was fighting\nduring the war. They would give me maybe even a tutor to prepare me. But then I had my\nsister and somehow it -- everything it changed. And then start the movement of leaving in\nthe Soviet Union. People start leaving the Soviet Union and going up west. And I decided I\nhad it enough. I didn\u2019t had nobody. I lost everybody and I don\u2019t want to be on the bloody\nheart any more. It was too painful. I looked in everybody\u2019s eyes and I was ashame of\nmyself. I said, \u201cMaybe they were helping the Germans to find little kids, little Jewish\nchildren.\u201d They were kids, they were adorable as I remember them. So I decided to leave.\nAnd I remember when the war -- the war ended and they announced on the radio. So they\ncame to the municipality. And there were rockets and there were big festivities and people\nwere rejoicing and I rejoiced of course with them, because the evil was conquered, it was\ndown to earth, was -- was -- was beaten to -- to the ground.

        "A: You know, it\u2019s funny, no, you know, I didn\u2019t. You know what struck me very much,\nthough? When I gave my ammunition back and I came up to Dubnow, was a city, Dubnow\nand I came right away, I asked some Jewish people alive, so they used to point it out, this\nhouse, that house. And I came to one house and I -- we were like a novelty, I and I have a\nfriend of mine. A novelty when we told them we were partisans, we were fighting, we were\nhealthy looking. And they came out, they were all, you know, white face, they were hiding,\nthey were doing whatever, I don\u2019t remember, even. And there was some kind of rabbi, all\nwas hut in there amongst them who survived. And I told him -- he asked me, I said, \u201cMy\nparents.\u201d And he said kaddish and that\u2019s what struck me, right then and then, you\nunderstand? Because I was busy constantly, with fighting, with doing the things I was\ndoing. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s when it struck me really hard. And I -- and I saw the reality of the\nwhole thing. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- I -- I -- and another thing. When I came -- we erected --\nthe survivors -- there survived a few survivors from my town. We decided to erect on the\nplace where they murdered the -- the -- the thousand and thousands of people, we decided to\nput on there a monument. When I came down there after the place, because I escaped from\nthat enclosure -- we cut the barbed wire, we ran out. The rest of the people were taken over\nthe hills, were taken a kilometer or two in the woods and down there -- ditches were\nprepared and they did it -- what they did in every other place. The same thing, I understand.\nI was not there because I wouldn\u2019t be here. And so -- so when I came down there and we\ncame down there and we were standing down there, over the place actually, you know,\nwhere my parents, my little sister, my little brother maybe down there lay. You know I\ncouldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t put a tear out of my eyes. I stood down there like a -- like a stone. I --\nin -- and it made me angry, you understand? It made me mad like hell. Because something 1s\nin -- I feel the pain and here I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t express it outside. Then of course, you\nknow, little by little, the start pouring out -- out of me. But it was very sad. Very sad and\nvery unjust, what I was looking the unjustnessty. Th-The terrible thing was down -- my\nfamily was a beautiful family. We were not rich materially, but my father was, I think, you\nknow -- I look at the pictures sometimes, the kids say he looks like Prince Philips. I says,\n\u201cHe was a prince in his own right.\u201d He was a -- he was a great man. He was a good man. He\nwas helping his fellow citizen, he was helping his fellow -- whatever he could. He was in\nthe forest, if somebody needed some wood for the house to build, he used help him out.\nBecause the -- he knew their -- their struggle. You understand, he knew their strugg -- and\nhe was good by heart. Our son 1s just like it -- like -- like his grandfather. So this is -- this 1s\nall the -- the things what -- what has struck me very, very badly. If you didn\u2019t have time to\ngrieve, where do you -- how -- how do you? We were all the same, we used to talk and we\nused to reminisce and we used to tell how and what and that\u2019s about that. We -- we -- had no\n-- to go to psychiatrist or to do those things, we just in our own heads, in our own thing, we\nmade -- and at least we accomplished something. When I saw -- when I saw the crushing of\ntheir army -- the big superman, they were not supermen. Hitler taught them mean they are\nsupermen. Of course they were supermen against women and children. Against women and\nchildren, was supermen. Because they had the guns, we were not prepared for them. But\nthey were not supermen after they start getting a beating. The partisan gave them from one\nside and then the army, they retreat and under Stalingrad. I think that was the beginning of\nthe defeat. In the winters in Russia. And he -- he paid a price. It\u2019s not enough, the way I see\nit, but that\u2019s -- at least.",
        "A: No [inaudible] not at all. We didn\u2019t know. And the funny part, when I was in Treblinka,\nthat\u2019s what got the guts out of me. Treblinka sits in the woods and when I -- we went in -- in\nTreblinka was one -- one -- one rail -- one -- one train what take you in and it struck me so\nbad because that\u2019s the end, you understand? Like this line, this is it. And most of the people\nwere murdered down there, except for some cleaning up, whatever. But ever the people\nwere brought down there, that was the end, that was a massacre. And this has struck me and\nthe funny part, I looked right and I used to look left, at the homes of the Poles who lived\ndown there and whenever I saw a old house, I said, \u201cDammit, those people were being\ndown there when those people were bringing in the thousands. And they didn\u2019t raise their\nvoices, they didn\u2019t say nothing to nobody.\u201d On this I -- I felt very -- and in the woods, was\nthe whole camp situated, with the birds singing in the quietness of that place, in the woods\nsurrounding, I said, \u201cIf we partisans would have come down there, you don\u2019t know what we\nwould have done to those Germans.\u201d",

Give us -- give us, we need it.\nYou don\u2019t need it any more. And this was sad and this was very hard to digest.

And that\u2019s what struck\nme and I told them. Very -- I was very, very touched -- very, very hurt. And they were our\nfriends. And so anyway, what the -- the main -- the main thing, she survived. And it\u2019s sels --\nor it\u2019s her story to tell how did she. She was -- she was plenty times almost killed by the\nnational Ukrainians. At one point she escaped from that woman, because they were after her\nto kill her. And somebody tipped her off and she ran a -- she ran away from -- from that\nhouse and they -- and -- and she survived. So it was one -- one miracle, I don\u2019t know. I\ndon\u2019t believe in miracles, but somehow. I guess miracle a people are making, miracles\nhappen. That\u2019s how I find my sister afte-after I came from the war. At this -- at those people\nwho were our friends. And there were -- I said, I was very hurt by that. It\u2019s not a easy task\nthat I\u2019m doing now, but I wanted -- I don\u2019t call the museum a museum, I call it a learning\ncenter. I call it -- it\u2019s all human beings. And it\u2019s not a Jewish problem, it\u2019s a human problem.\nI feel on that we will -- or we will live in peace or we\u2019ll perish like fools. It\u2019s a big liga said\nSO.",
        "A: Yeah. We already, you know, we already trials and tribulation went through. She went\none way and she was, you know, harassed by the shepherds, by the Ukrainian. You know h-\nhow, you know, people can take advantage if they know you don\u2019t have nobody, no\nprotection or nothing. They used to harass her, they used to call her names and all kind of\nthing. But this is all things, you know, you can live with, but she lived through and that\u2019s\nthe main thing. And she has her own story to tell. She was in the orphanage. She -- I put her\nto school, right when we came out from the woods, she went to school. I did not proceeded,\nI wanted to proceed in school, but I never proceeded.",
        "A: Absolutely. It was bombed. It was destroyed a half. There were holes sinking because\nthat\u2019s a very strategic point, was Sarnee. There was this railroad, what a lody trains used to\ncome. It was Laviastand, it\u2019s a central station. But from all parts of the thing used to come,\nfrom Kiev, from this all and were -- somehow they were -- they were -- they were cross --\ncriss-cross down there in Sarnee. And -- and the fights were very fierce right around Sarnee.\nThere were some of our people who survived --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: A mess. And it was -- it looked like a city deserted. Not the same people. It used to be\nalways a lot of fun to got out in the street and see people strolling, going -- going about their\nbusiness, going home, coming from home, young people -- young. And this was like -- like\n-- like not the same. A lot of the homes were destroyed, not kept right and -- and a lot of the\nbombs destroyed -- a lot of the bombs destroyed because it was a strategic point, like I\nexplained to you. And so it was not the same. It was a sad city. And --",

        "A: It was close, yeah -- yeah. Because they are advancing, we knew they are already -- they\nare dead. But -- because they -- they had to still to clean out some pockets of Germans, who\nthese are -- still were fighting with these up til the end. But we knew that\u2019s the end, that\u2019s it.\nGermany is -- 1s under.",
        "A: I was with them in the woods, but then some of them -- you see when the Soviets --\nwhen the Soviets start retreating, a lot the people went along with them, because they heard\nsome of them, they were scared and they would have just -- they be behind the German --\nthat they went with them. They retreated and then they came back after the war ended. They\ncame back, they thought they\u2019ll find some of the family, some of the thing, they didn\u2019t. So\nsome of the people returned back to -- to Sarnee. Very few I knew. And the funny part -- I\ndon\u2019t know if I said in the -- in the original -- when the Soviets came, they start also\narresting people and taking them to Siberia. At this was -- I\u2019m talking about 1939, when\nthey marched in -- into our country. And there were Capitalists they arrested, umtee,\nCommunists, whatever -- any, any -- some slogan, whatever they can atthat. They were\narresting them and calling them yenna -- yenna joshnie element. It\u2019s mean untrustworthy --\nunfor --trustworthy people. And -- and they took him away to Siberia. The tragedy was so\nterrible, everybody -- they thought that\u2019s the end of those people. Everybody cried, it was\nterrible. Little did we knew that their fate was not sealed. A lot of them died of s -- maybe\ndown there of heavy -- of hard work -- of the climate, malnutrition, whatever it is. But the\nbulk of them survived. We the lucky ones, we all perished, except the exception, including\nme. But I sur -- I -- I escaped by a miracle or whatever. And the bullet didn\u2019t strike me,\nthat\u2019s all -- plain as it 1s.",
        "A: When I was escaped, I was among the -- the peasants. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t miss any and\nexcept salt, I didn\u2019t miss any, you know, it was nothing gourmet food, but potatoes and\nwhatever, not -- it was -- it was enough to eat and enough to survive. Potatoes and a piece of\nbread and -- except salt was scarce. I used to sometimes beg the peasant for a little salt,\nbecause without this I think the feet start falling on -- there\u2019s something -- it\u2019s something not\n-- not -- thing happening. But otherwise -- otherwise it was okay. Not exactly we\u2019re\nstarving. In the ghetto was more harsh than after I escaped. If not I used to go and get\nmyself potatoes in the field and -- and bring in the woods -- get myself, help myself. And\nget in the fields and -- and whatever -- whose field it was I didn\u2019t care. A few potatoes it\nwouldn\u2019t -- wouldn\u2019t bother nobody.

        "A: I had -- I-I had -- I was very sad, I didn\u2019t know, I was trying de -- ge -- where, but my --\nmy first thought was to go to Palestine on that time. And then I joined a group, a kibbutz,\nyou know and to go to a kibbutz and to go to Palestine. But then of course the plans\nchanged. My husband was a fighter, I was a fighter and we were plain -- were tired of\nfighting and I knew I have to start all over again coming to the -- to Palestine on that time.\nThey were -- they were fighting for their independent.

        "A: Some members of my fam -- my uncle came in of course, to Sarnee, then my cousin and\nthen we left the Soviet Union and we went -- we left the Soviet actually and anybody who\nwas a citizen of Poland, had the right to leave the Soviet Union -- Russia at that time and to\nemigrated to Poland. My intention was that I\u2019Il go on the western side, on the American\nside, on the English side and from there I can go better than while being in the Soviet Union\nbecause it was a dic -- a dictatorship. And I -- Zionism was taboo. Zionism was taboo, you\ncould not even mention the word Zionism, because this is nationalism and this is already has\na con-connotation with you know, the -- so it was taboo at that time. So I wanted to go into\nthe western side and from there I would go to Palestine. Of course the struggle in Palestine,\nwe know it. So we decided -- my aunt send us an affidavit. I had an aunt here in\nWashington, who was my mother\u2019s sister, who left Russia that time. We are talking about --\nI don\u2019t remember what she said, 1914, 19 -- way, way before the war or before the -- the\nrevolution was. She left and she came to the States. So I knew we had a -- we had a -- I have\nan aunt down here, my mother\u2019s sister. And the funny part, the way I found her. I ask my\nuncle, because I didn\u2019t know -- I know that someplace I had a aunt, my grandmother -- my\nBubba, I used to call her -- used to show pictures and used to kiss -- \u201cThese are my\ngrandchildren from the United States,\u201d and all kind of stuff like that. So I knew they had --\nthey had these and these names and they were living someplace in Detroit, so I asked my\nuncle where did my aunt lived, what city? He said, \u201cIn Detroit, Michigan.\u201d He remembered\nthat. So I went -- so how do you find in Detroit, Michigan? I didn\u2019t know the language, I\ndidn\u2019t know. But there was a student, a Jewish student who took English and he was -- and\nhe knew English and I went up to him and I told him my story and I tell, \u201cHow do I find my\n-- my -- my relatives? This and that much I know.\u201d He said, \u201cLet me try something.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cIll pay you for it, if you find them.\u201d He sent into the police department in Detroit,\nMichigan, a letter that said these and these people are looking f -- they are sur -- they\nsurvived the war and they are looking for their relatives in the States and within a week or\ntwo weeks, I received a -- a response, they are not in Detroit, Michigan, but they are in\nWashington.",

We had to leave Russia not -- not legally, it was half legal. We had to leave\nthrough -- cross the borders and come on the western side because they would right away,\nthey would arrest you -- they would whatever. But there was already a movement start\ngoing because we survivors didn\u2019t wanted to go on the bloody earth any more and we\ndecided to go up to the west. To the west I mean England, the States and whatever not. So\nwe left, we actually went through the border, the Czechoslovakian -- the Czechoslovakian\nbor -- the -- the -- on the border police, they were very sympathetic to us. They didn\u2019t ask us\ntoo many questions either. We tell them we are ref -- we are political refugees and that\u2019s it,\nthey knew it.",

So I made out my paper with a shalone of the\nlody -- a lot of people who left Poland, I went on the Polish side, because Poland was -- at\nthat time a half of Poland was -- the Germans divided. They gave it back to the Soviets and\na piece of Germany, they gave it to the Poles. The geography changed at that time. You\nfollow me? Yeah. So the geography changed. So my part remained in the Soviet Union, but\nI had the right to leave the Soviet Union because I was a citizen of Poland, I was a Pole by\nnationality. And to go on the western side.

I was myself doing things, I had to make, you\nknow, just to feed myself, I had the -- the -- you know ways to sell, buy, whatever I could\njust to make some food. So my sister, it was no future. I had -- my sister had to go to school\nat that time. So I gave her -- she went -- I put her in a orphanage home with a lot the other\nfrom different cities. And I remember it was in Ludwigsdorf, I think, Ludwigsdorf, on the\nPolish side. It was right on the -- on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. And\nshe stayed down there and I used to visit her every week. And all of a sudden, I come one\nweek, my sister is not there. They said it is mun, they don\u2019t have the kibbutz any more and I\nask how and w-why and they told me they -- they went over on the other side. And I knew\nexactly what they were talking about. They went over the border, they went via -- th-\nthrough Czechoslovakia and they went on the American zone. So I lost my sister at that\ntime. I went to Poland. My sister, with the -- with the all group of kids, wind up on the\nexodus, going to Palestine at that time. And then they turned them back, back to Hamburg,\nthey disembarked them, there when I met my sister and I brought her to Italy. I came -- I\ncame from Italy to meet her. It\u2019s a little complicated, but that\u2019s the way it was.",

It was, you know -- it was still all mish --\nmish-mash, it was all -- all -- all things. And then eventually I find out that she was on the\nexodus. At that time we didn\u2019t know exodus will get so famous. On the exodus -- on the\nexodus boat, the -- the ship, they brought them to Haifa, they brought them to Cyprus and\nthen they brought them to Marseilles. They disembarked them in -- near Hamburg, there I\ndecided -- I find out everything in the thier, I decided I'll make a passport, I'll go and I\u2019Il get\nmy sister and I\u2019ll bring her to Italy.

I guess we -- 1t was\nnews at that time. They were brought into Hamburg and I remember there are frogmen\nactually went under it and they told the English that we are going to go to pieces to get\nevery the -- with the ship, if you will not. And they were afraid at that time for public\nopinion and they let it go and they made a deal at that time I think, with the Hagannah, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly the deal they made with the Hagannah, so the people, they -- they ask\nthe people to disembark and they put them in a camp in -- near Hamburg. Near Hamburg.\nAnd I went all across Germany, I went to Hamburg, picked up my sister and it was another\nstory by itself, so this will not go in.

Aleah bet and\nall those thing, they were working together with us and we wanted to leave, that\u2019s it -- it\u2019s\nenough. The -- the earth was bloody, it didn\u2019t felt -- there -- no attachment, nothing. There\u2019s\nnothing down there but givas.

And on the western side, it\u2019s where we wind up in Beetun and -- and\nfrom Beetun, one day, they decided to close the Czechoslovakian border, was also\norganized.

I went through how and our little grandson,\nwho\u2019s 10, he was nine at the time, after I talk -- and I did not even understood if this kid\nwould understand and I didn\u2019t -- I -- you understand, it\u2019s nine years old. But after I spoke,\nhe said, \u201cGrandma Boby, c -- would you speak to my school, come to my school and tell\nyour story?\u201d I said, \u201cIf your teacher will invite me, Pll come.\u201d [inaudible] tell him, you\nunderstand? So I made something -- in -- impression or something on he may understand.\nHe said, \u201cI know you fought the Germans.\u201d And this is -- I wanted my kids to know that I\nwas not sitting idly and was waiting to be killed. I went out to fight and there were many\nJewish boys and girls who did it. Actually I was the first one in Washington who spoke\nabout it. The first -- the first about the partisans, about the fighters. And I know girls who\nnever lived to see the day of liberation. They died fighting. I was the lucky one to tell my\nstory. And there were one on top of the other, I know, but every day was a constant -- a\nconstant moving, a constant going, a constant doing something. Or we were ambush them,\nthey ambushed us. And it\u2019s a constant or we be there on their back, constant. And you were\ntired. You were tired very much. I remember almost I -- I paid with my life. I came four\no\u2019clock, my worst time, my worst time of the day is -- 1s daybreak, between like four or\nthree o\u2019clock, three o\u2019clock at night til -- til six, three til six. We came to a certain\ndestination and -- and I felt -- my commanding officer came up and he said I have to stand\non -- on patrol. And I begged him -- we were -- we were -- we were traveling on horses,\nthey\u2019re almost old than I. I begged him, Ill give you two times, I\u2019ll give you four hours\nlater, but let me rest. I know my weakness. He insisted, I don\u2019t know what was the reason, I\nhad -- I went down there and actually I didn\u2019t fell asleep, but actually I -- I dozed off. And\nthere were -- the guy who was -- was checking on the sentries, he grabbed on my -- on my --\non my gun -- he -- he -- he grabbed the gun and you know, he had the right to kill me right\nthere and then because this is -- this is a war, it\u2019s not -- 1t\u2019s not no -- no nonsense. And the\nnext day I was called to the headquarters and I thought that they\u2019re going to put me at firing\nsquad. I came -- I -- I was a little bit, you know, inside -- a little bit afraid, I don\u2019t know, you\nknow. I said, you know, they\u2019ll put me as a example. But somehow they gave me a warning\nthat time. And I know I\u2019Il been watched and after a month or so, they already praised me\nthere. I done good and they said they -- but this happened.",

And they -- they got a\nhold of any of the enemy on the other side and -- he was a big shot. He was one of the\nengineers who build the pantom planes -- the pantom bridges, what they -- you -- during the\nwar the -- the -- the -- the tanks are going over and the -- the tanks. You know the -- fast --\nyou have to come to a -- to a river and you have to build them right there and then. And he\nfell in-into our hands with his chauffeur, with his car, with all those things. And decide to\nhave -- I -- I said I\u2019m not for it -- kill him and over with. And I remember I saw him face to\nface. He said he had a child. I said, \u201cI had a mother an-and a father too. And I had a brother\nand a sister.\u201d And I said, \u201cAnd I had a grandfather and a grandmother.\u201d But they -- I don\u2019t\nknow.

I said, \u201cYou know,\nhe\u2019s a enemy, we don\u2019t have no place to keep him as a thing, just --.\u201d\u2019 But some guys say I\ncannot, you understand? You can not be responsible, but, you know, that\u2019s the way it\nhappened on that time. We didn\u2019t have no prisoners of war, we didn\u2019t have no prison camps,\nwe didn\u2019t have no places to keep him. I remember from Moscow, a student, a -- a medical\nstudent came to us, they dropped him -- parachuted him into our midst. And I don\u2019t know\nwhat they told him in Moscow, I don\u2019t know what they told him. So when he -- when he\ncame to our midst and he was walking with me -- next to me, he asked, \u201cWhere 1s the\nsecond -- where is the next hospital we are taking all our wounded?\u201d So we start laughing.\nYou understand, it was a joke for us all. You know, we are already the veterans, the old\npeople who went on there for -- for a few years, or this. A hospital, I said, \u201cYou see this b --\nhorse and buggy? This is our hospitals. And this is our surgeon and this is assistant, we are\ndoing it right here -- in here, we\u2019re in -- the -- right here, in the open field.\u201d And it was cold,\nwe used to make a bonfire if it\u2019s -- we could. And a -- many times -- many -- sometimes we\nwere not allowed, because the enemy would sniff us out -- would find us out, where we are.\nAnd we were a might -- 1500 to 1600 people, full equipped. But this big -- a big unit, a lot\nof thing. And I think the partisan fought -- I think very gallantly and I think I\u2019m proud to be\na part of this movement at that time, with no reservation.",
        "A: Maybe some did. Like in any people. I would ask them how many countries resisted the\nGermans. The Jews were not ready. They were civilians. This was a government. A\ngovernment with all the institution, with all the propagandas, with all their might, was --\nwere planning a execution of a people. And they have the surroundings. They already\nprepared the hostile surroundings. They made them Fascist, them made them national\nwhatever they call themselves. And they helped them out in this -- in this horrible task, to\nmurder and some of them their own citizen, their own friends. And then the Germans saw\nwhat they are doing, that they use for instance, people from my town -- if he become -- if he\nbecame a Fascist, they would take him and take him to another city and from the other city,\nbring him in my city, there should be no -- no personal connection, you understand? There\nshould be no -- no -- that\u2019s how he could do his -- his -- his -- his dirty job, his -- his terrible\nthing. Does it make sense?\nyour m -- husband, you had gotten married.

We -- she send us affidavit and\nhow -- that how we came, in 1951, in the end of 1951, all -- almost Christmastime, we were\non this sh-ship, on the Constitution, coming to the United States.

        "A: From Germany to Italy, my -- my husband had some kind assignment to work some --\nsomethings -- to help out with some kind of -- some kind of job. So we decided to go to\nItaly and that\u2019s what the decision was made there and there and we left -- and this was like a\ntransit, like Austria, Italy and then we\u2019ll go to Palestine. Then, being in Italy, we changed\nour mind and we said, \u201cWe are tired of fighting, we\u2019ll go to the States and if we don\u2019t like it,\nthen --.\u201d",

You know also, the day when we got married, yes, I forgot to mention, he\ngot a telegram that his sister survived from a concentration camp and she lives in Italy. So\nall together, like camil -- like kenna -- like all together. And right after we got married, we\nwent to Italy, we met his sister and from there of course -- then afterwards we came to the\nStates. And some people went to Palestine.

        "A: Oh, it was a -- a wedding, you know, it\u2019s like the whole camp participated and it was like\na -- a big -- a big excitement for everybody here, we got married. First of all I didn\u2019t want tt,\nI said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll go to Italy and down there we\u2019ll see what\u2019s what,\u201d but my uncle\ninsisted -- my uncle insisted, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have nobody, he doesn\u2019t have nobody, why --\nmake it legal.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s make it legal.\u201d You know, I was reluctant, yes,\nmarriage, you know, we go over the borders and all those thing. So we decided to get\nmarried and it was a big excitement, we were the only one, bride and groom, to get married\nand this and that. So it was the excitement of the whole -- of the whole camp. Like they --\nthey -- one woman baked a cake, the other one it was -- they brought a dean in the kibbutz.\nIn the kibbutz was the -- the -- the wedding. We had the -- we had attendant -- attendant\nwith two rabbis. Rabbis were attending our wedding. So it was -- it was interesting. I -- I felt\na little bit jitter I remember, it was so funny, it\u2019s like a commitment, it\u2019s like something, you\nknow.

But they were also -- they were something -- they were in the camp. One is a\nHungarian I think and one Czechoslovakian or so. So we had two rabbis to our wedding. I\nhave some pictures someplace, I -- I did not refer them -- I don\u2019t -- not thinking about tt.\nThey are in black and white.

But it\u2019s was\norganized and each -- let\u2019s say there were a few kibbutzim, a few groups, what they -- each\none cared for them, you know, there were separate entities, like. And I would say they were\nwell organized and we u -- we used to get some kind of provision, I don\u2019t know how, from\nthe highers, from the joint distribution committee. I don\u2019t know exactly. But we used to get\nsome provisions somep -- some -- some breve -- some ri -- assigned to us. I don\u2019t remember\nexactly. My uncle, I think used to get it. We used to be all involved.",
        "A: Not exactly, not -- not exactly free and go, we had to have a little thing to go out from\nthe camp to stroll around. For instance, once I was arrested by the MP.

But it was funny, because we were not allowed perfaca to go down there, we had\nto have a permission or something. But we used to go out. It was not so bad. We used to go\nout and we used to s -- to -- to, but one occasion it was that way. We were arrested by the\nMP, but this is -- was -- maybe, I don\u2019t know, we were young girls and they were young\nboys, so, you know.",

        "A: No, nothing. They said they\u2019 Il arrest us and -- but it\u2019s -- nothing happened. No, it was a\nlittle bit of excitement 1n the -- in the town down there and I think we needed some kind of -\n- if we go to the city, I -- but I don\u2019t remember. But people used to move around, we used to\ngo, we used to even go up to Lind\u2019s, we used to go there and here with thems -- we\u2019re some\n-- I don\u2019t remember this is exactly, the restrictions had a ba -- but we used to move, we used\nto go up to Lind\u2019s and there and here and somehow we used to find our way, how to go\nabout.

        "A: Yeah, because they\u2019re all, you know the tone was already different, you know. He said --\nthey were ti -- for instance, the town where he was born, they said he was a nasty and he\nwas a bad guy when he was young, but you know during his last time, maybe they talked,\nthey -- they spoke differently about him, you understand? But in our time he came down\nthere, listen the shoemaker, this one, I used to take my shoes, he used to say he was nasty,\nhe was -- he was beating up everybody and this and that. But we had connection, yes,\ndefinitely, with the Austrian. Not go bosom buddies, you know, we were separate from\nthem.",
        "A: I felt a resentment to all those things when it happened, but not in a personal, you know,\nwhen you meet a person, the person, then they meet you. Of course when you find out he\nwas a Nazi or involved with the thing, you right away felt a revolt too much then. Felt a\nresentment, felt a fimkanee -- finekinay you understand? Because I knew what they -- what\nthey were all -- what they were all about, what their aim was.",
        "A: Not -- they would not tell me. If they were, they would not tell me. Sometimes they\nwould say a word here and there, I used to make a puzzle and find out that\u2019s they were\ninvolved somewhat with the Nazis. I already had my way. I knew that they were something\ninvolved with them. They were -- later on they knew it was not a big honor, to be from the\nHitler youth, or from the Nazi movement. And I don\u2019t know how many Germans -- a lot of\nGermans knew what was going on. But the propaganda was so harsh and they -- about the\nJews, they portrayed the Jews with the -- with the -- with the noses, with the things. Hitler\nhimself, if he take off his hair, he looked more like a caricature he would make of the Jews,\nhe would be one. But that\u2019s -- that\u2019s another thing. But put him in -- in the uniform of our\nconcentration camp, let\u2019s see how he\u2019d lever look. And if he would be alive out there, they\nput him -- well they put him in -- in a cage. To look at the specimen.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I love the Italian people. In the beginning I felt a funny feeling about Fascism and\nMussolini, but after I -- I find out he was also -- he was also like a victim, he went with H1-\nHitler and then he was in his game already. He -- with all this -- like he blackmailed him\nintel -- in a lot of things, because Mussolini was in the begin -- after we met the Italian\npeople, I -- I didn\u2019t feel bad about it, because we knew that they tricked him in, also -- in a\nlot of ca -- of cases and a lot of ways. And with this patachi, whatever he was involved 1n,\nit\u2019s, you know -- all sorts -- 1t\u2019s a work of the -- I think of the Nazis, of the Germans, they\npushed on him. And so I didn\u2019t felt resentment. I liked my -- my neighbors. I became even\nvery friendly with them. Our daughter was born -- re-really was born in Italy, she had\nfriend, a friend next door, used to go out. They were very nice and very interesting people.\nMost of them liked opera, like singing, you know, they used to sing arias in the -- a bu -- a\nguy on a bicycle used to go -- ride on the bicycle and sing arias from the opera.

        "A: Not at all. And I -- it was so difficult for me, I remember Christmas, I could not even\npronounce it. It was Christmastime and -- and my Rita spoke Italian very well and she met\nanother Italian lit-little kid and they used to play together. And what worried me very much,\nI remember being on the Constitution, they told me in Italy that everything 1s -- is conser --\nconserved, everything is conserved there in the United -- everything comes in boxes and in -\n- in package. And I liked fresh foods. And -- and I said, God, she sa -- even chicken, you --\nyou get it in a -- you know, it\u2019s so all -- all -- all creative things for some people. And this --\nI met this Italian woman and start talking to her, she said, \u201cI knew -- I live in the United\nStates. You can get as much fresh food as you want to. Just if you wanted to do this, it\u2019s\nfine. Of course we have -- we have -- we have --.\u201d I was so happy, I remember. I just came\nrunning and I said, \u201cOh my God, look at that.\u201d It was a false -- a false information before.\nAnd so we came and I got very sick on the -- coming in here on the -- on the ship.

        "A: I was ill the entire trip. No, the -- not the entire -- up til we came to the Gabriel tart. The\nGabriel tart are the deep waters already, Africa and there -- down there in the -- on the horn.\nWhen we came down there, right away I got like somebody would -- there I got right away\nsick. I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t even go near the -- the -- the dining room, that\u2019s how darn sick I\nwas. And I thought, \u201cGod almighty, I will never see here, I went through all these things,\nthe war and everything, Ill never see.\u201d I was so sick to my stomach. When they told me the\nStatue of Liberty, I came out -- crawl out from down there, from the -- my cabin and I\nlooked and it was a sight to see, I remember. I remember it in the early morning, the Statue\nof Liberty, with the thing and it was -- 1t was very fine. Then we came to the harbor of New\nYork. There was a cousin of ours, were waiting for us. I expected my aunt to come from\nWashington, she didn\u2019t, but she gave some words to my -- our cousin in New York and she\nsent her son and he -- and he was waiting for us -- for our arrival. Then we -- when we\ncame, he greeted us, so it was -- 1t was a little bit -- it w -- you know, very -- it was pleasant\nfor us. And -- and I remember on a Sunday we arrived on the harbor and -- and New York.\nAnd then another one, she was a distant relative of some kind and she was married and she\ncame also to greet us. And something I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her, I don\u2019t know\nexactly, but something about. Whatever -- she was standing, I don\u2019t know, something I\ndidn\u2019t had a good feeling about her. And maybe I thought she did the -- looked down, I\ndon\u2019t know, something -- I didn\u2019t had a good feeling about her. And then he took us to his\nhouse, this Dave, who came to -- to greet us on the thing. And when we came out from that -\n- from the harbor, I didn\u2019t like it. I said, \u201cThis is America? This is the United States?\u201d\nEverything -- you know Sunday, it was deserted and those big factories down there, right\ndown there in the -- it was something -- I did not, it made a funny impression on me.\nSomething -- I expected in my head the United States to be something, something. And here\nI see this empty and the big, big, huge, huge buildings. And then he took us to his house and\nwhen I walked in, it was like in the movies I see. It was as -- a small, little apart -- a nice\napartment. It was a two story, with -- with the steps going up and it was -- and I said to\nLeon, \u201cLookit, it\u2019s like in the movies we saw, American movies, it\u2019s like in the movies.\u201d\nAnd there was a television and -- and I remember and also this has struck me very funny at\nthat time. It was a Milton Berle show at that time, very, very, very, very popular, everybody\nwas watching, it was such an excitement like who knows what was going on. And I came\nthe first night -- instead of talking to us, she left us and she went to watch Milton Berle and -\n- and I felt so funny about it, because I said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen this -- in Europe, I\nwouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d But this is, you know, maybe it was no harm was done. You understand,\nbut I was so touched by every little thing that I -- I -- I -- I just felt 1t\u2019s, you know, it was not\nright. But this was the first impression about the United States. And they had their daughter\n-- and then I walked in and a -- and upstairs they had her bedroom and she had so many\nshoes and I ask her, \u201cWhy do you have so many shoes?\u201d It was everything something new\nfor me, something different, than I\u2019m used to down there. But anyway it was -- it was okay.\nI was a little bit angry at my aunt, she didn\u2019t come, but she was not a rich woman herself,\nshe was a hard working woman. So then -- and then when we came to the -- to Washington,\nI could understand. She couldn\u2019t leave at that time her husband or whatever. So we stayed. I\nhad a little bit also f-feelings about my cousins because maybe I expected from them more\nthan they could give me. You know, I was -- I was wounded, like a wounded animal and\nhere -- you understand, a little compassion, a little understanding, a little asking about their\nfamily. It\u2019s not you and us. It\u2019s not, yet -- it\u2019s the same.",
        "A: It\u2019s something like a division, like -- ignorant about that what was going on down there.\nIt\u2019s like they talk about -- they talked about Europe, let\u2019s say, there would be like it\u2019s\nanother planet. And this is something that struck me very un-understanding. They never --\nthey never asked me, you\u2019re some -- you know this is a little bit -- was, you know. But then\ntheir children were more -- were more sub-subseptive, more -- more understanding, more\nthink towards -- they used to ask me some question and some of them were vrot some and\nthey ask me some question about what happening in Europe. They were already start to\nbeing more aware of that. But their parents, no. Once in awhile we used to be invited, but\nnot -- but not close- close like. But that\u2019s the way it was.",

        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And I thought I singled them out, I thought maybe they are not aware,\nbecause I\u2019m -- okay, whatever -- I ne -- wanted to say. But that was hurting very much. Our\nchildren should have been more together with them. We used to get together, but not at real\nfamily, you know, because they were my immediate family, that\u2019s all that I had. And so this\nis -- this is the way the [indecipherable] remain on our own. We stood on our own two feet,\nwe made it. And made it pretty okay, made a nice living. We raised our kids, like I said, we\nare very proud of each one of them. One is in advertising, one is a free lance writer in Los\nAngeles and we have a son who is doing very well, he is a nice human being, that\u2019s the --\nvery important.

After arriving in New York, we were down there for a week, rested up a little bit\nbecause I was very weak coming down from the ship and I was -- I was still going around\nlike being dizzy after I already came on the ground. So I was dizzy and I was -- I was weak.\nI didn\u2019t eat nothing. I had to come back to myself. And so for a -- a -- something like a\nweek, we stayed in New York with our relatives and -- and from New York, we came to\nWashington. And on the station -- on -- we came by train at that time I remember. On the\nstation we were greeted by my aunt, uncle and a cousin, a survivor, I remember, who came\nbefore I had afass, and my cousin who -- her grandparents I described down there when I\nleft them, right, in Sarnee, before I escaped from the -- from the execution, the Pomerantz\nfamily.",
        "A: My aunt -- yeah, this was -- I had -- my aunt prepared for us an apartment. And -- so this\nwas, but my husband didn\u2019t have a job yet, so he went around til he find himself a job. We\nbrought a little bit money with us. We were doing a little business in Italy, so we were not\ncompletely, you know, penniless. So we brought a little bit money with us and -- and then\nhe start looking for a job, he find a -- a job in the United Typewriter Company, was at that\ntime. And he was working down there for a few years, til he went in business for himself.\nAnd I -- I was home taking care of the kids, they were little. I wanted to go also in the\nteaching, to be like a Sunday and I had to leave the kids on Sundays and I decided against it,\nI said, \u201cIt\u2019s more important for me to be with the children than to leave them on Sundays,\nunsupervised.\u201d And maybe I did a good choice, I don\u2019t know.",

I wanted to go in Hebrew and then I -- 1-1t was not a lot of English to\nknow that, you know, in the school, in the Hebrew school, cause I want to teach in Hebrew.\nWas Hebrew and some other and that was a parochial Hebrew school in Washington. I had\nto go trum a little with a few courses, because I was already aware of being -- in the camp, I\nwas teaching first graders and kindergarten. So I -- I had to go through a course and then I\ndidn\u2019t -- I decided against it. I said it was more important for the kids -- sometimes we used\nto go out skating o-or skiing even, we went away for the weekends. And we were together\nwith the family, so I think this was -- it was not a bad choice at that time.",
        "A: It was different. Some people were preoccupied with things that did not -- there a lot of\nemphasis money, money, money -- and something that sometimes used to rub me the wrong\nway. But you know, and I thought maybe because we didn\u2019t feel strongly, that I could not\nfigure out what it is sometimes used to rub me [inaudible] the wrong way. And -- but little\nby little we adjusted. We were different, I would say. You know, but I did not blame,\nbecause I went through my journey, life was a completely different one from the people\nwho were born in here, that didn\u2019t experience no hardship, nothing. They were spoiled in\nmy estimation, in my eyes. Sometimes I used to call them the spoiled America.

But it was behind their\nunderstanding. The first time, when I came out to speak to those people about my partisan\nactivities, about being -- I\u2019m telling you, I made a impression on people. They went through\nthat time, difficult, difficult, difficult times. One became a lawyer and the other one I met,\nabout si -- about eight or nine years later, in Washington. And she looked very much, you\nknow, very blonde and very, you know, she looks like a Swedish girl. And there she tells a\nstory, she was -- she heard all kinds of stories about the Jews and here she heard me telling\nall these thing -- all these things. And I met her and I said, \u201cAre you\u2019re Gilbert? Are you\u2019re\nnot the girl who was at the first meeting when I spoke?\u201d And I told her where and on\nWillard Avenue, down there on the UJA? \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cyes, are you Brenda?\u201d Och, she\nstarted telling all her friends, you know, because I recognized her, her face was so -- so --\nthey -- told her friends, what -- and then -- then I said -- I invited her to our business and she\nsaid to my son, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what impression your mother made on me. She made me -\n- she made me do things. I forced myself.\u201d So my son made, again a remark, he said, \u201cShe\nmade a impression on me, too,\u201d you know, my son. And so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s did something, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- I think my story, it made a difference, I don\u2019t know what words I can choose\nfor.",

And -- and -- and they\naccepted it very nicely. And after I explained to them, who were the partisans, where the\npartisans, how did I wind up down there and what our journey was, what we did. And it was\na eye opener for them all.",

So I was down there as a member.\nAnd then I belonged to the -- to the survivors group. In the UJA, some time they wanted to\nknow more about the survivors and I was the one of us invited. And I came -- I was working\ndown there in business a little bit -- I came and I told them a little bit about my story, they\nsaid they wanted to hear more. So I came in a -- a evening, we were three -- thr -- two of us\n-- three of us, so each one was telling a story. I was different because I wasn\u2019t down there, I\nwent on to the partisans.

They said, \u201cYes, yes,\u201d and then,\nafterwards, they ask me some questions. But I think they did res -- was receptive to my\nstory. I think -- I think so. And this was my first and then I used to go out to schools and\nthen I worked with the children -- to schools a lody and speak to the students. And then I\nwalked in the children\u2019s museum, if you remember -- \u2018Remember the Children\u2019, before\nopening of the museum in Washington, I used to go down there sometimes three or four\ntimes a week. It was in northeast, down there on Eighth Street or something.",
        "A: A -- lin -- there is a children\u2019s museum down there with all international -- there is mec --\nthere 1s all kind of -- you know, on top used to be \u2018Remember the Children\u2019. It was Mrs.\nYates, it was the congresswoman was instrumental of -- of telling the story about the\nchildren, she shed -- s-she owns and it was a very -- a very wise choice at that time. I used to\ngo down there as a survivor to tell my story to the children. They were not allow children\nbelow six. And they had to be accompanied by their parents. Because it was, you know, it\nwas a sad story. And -- and then, after w-we were finished, that was -- the entrance was a\nmovie, then it was a whole wall of children, pre-war children, Jewish kids. Then it was a\nhouse in Germany, a Jewish family, the aroma even of the food you can smell and the\nsinging of the classical music. A -- a regular house, a middle -- middle class, or maybe -- I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of, but they\u2019re Jewish, nice home and then it used to be the resistant\nand then the family Voss, who saved a lot the Jewish children in Holland, I think, Mrs. Voss\ncomes. I -- I think she comes from Holland. She made a tunnel and I think they saved some\n-- | -- | met her. She came -- she be -- was honored in Washington. Her husband and her. So\nthere were the Voss family, the story about them and then used to be a la -- a little like\nlibrary with the Anne Frank\u2019s books, with all the books and these and the kids used to go all\nthis way and there was a book with they write their names and after they listen to whatever\nthe eyewitness was. They used to come back and write their impression or their feelings or\nwhatever they wanted. And I had a lot of nice -- nice little notes for me, you know. It\u2019s still\nsomeplace in the museum, must be. And -- and I used to explain to them and after we used\nto give them tiles. And on the tiles we used to ask them after I told them my little story, you\nknow, in the children\u2019s version, I could not go in in this and I told them, you have the Hitler\nand your orders, explain to them he was a bad man and all the thing explained in their own -\n- in their own level, for them to understand. And then we used to give them those tiles, they\nused to paint on the tiles and then they put it down, whatever their feelings in their heart.\nAnd the best tiles are now in -- on the wall in Washington. Down there where you go down\non the -- on the left hand after a whole wall. This is the tiles where I used to go down there\nand work with the kids. Now they minimized this one, \u201cRemember the Children\u2019, they made\nit Daniel\u2019s story -- out of it. So this is the Dantel\u2019s story, next -- you know, coming after\n\u201cRemember the Children\u2019.",

Once in awhile here, once in awhile there to -- to tell my story. Yes, this is a letter I\nreceived from a student after I shared my story with them and I thought -- I was very\ntouched and I thought I should read it -- I should read it here today. First he addressed to\nme, giving to his teacher because I didn\u2019t give out my -- my address. And he said to me,\n\u201cThank you for giving that remarkable, tragic story of your youth experience. I know no one\nthat wasn\u2019t there could understand the pain and toro -- and torment or could give you\nenough apologies or forgiveness. But [Il try to understand and feel what you have felt.

And she didn\u2019t went to\ntake her fix, she was so interested and so absorbed and so in -- 1n your story, that she stayed\nthrough all this time.\u201d And it touched me very, very much.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I called him up, he gave me his telephone through the teacher and I said,\n\u201cThis is not my mission, to convert nobody. If you want to convert to Judaism, you have to\nfind your own way, how to do it, through some other channels, but this is just me telling and\nsharing my story, what I went through and this should never happen to no one.\u201d And there\nwas another student in this same -- in this same school and he was a student from a mixed\nmarriage. His mother was German, his father was American. And he -- and he said he\u2019s\ngoing to Germany to see his grandparents. So I said, \u201cYou heard my story,\u201d I said, \u201ccan you\ngive me a promise?\u201d I said to talk to your grandparents and to tell them. And I think this\nwas my reward that day for speaking to those kids. I said, \u201cTell them exactly in the words I\ntold you.\u201d",

        "A: No. I did not -- I did not follow up on -- on things, you know, I didn\u2019t follow up. But this\nwas a very, very impressive -- I touched -- I was touched by it. Because the kids listened,\nthe kids understood and this 1s something.",

        "A: That\u2019s -- yeah, I thought so very much. It was very -- and I -- I said to him, \u201cDo you want\nall this trouble?\u201d You know, I mades a little joke with him, that\u2019s all. But I never followed\nup. Maybe I should, or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, but I never did.",
        "A: You know, when I was very frightened was the McCarthy era? Was very, very -- to us\nsurvivor, it was -- it was very unpleasant. But then, whatever we went through, I said, \u201cThis\nour home.\u201d This -- I felt more comfortable each year as I -- the kids are growing up, going\nto school and I felt more comfortable each year. This is my country -- there where I live and\nI am a part of it. But my story should go, I think, from generation to generation. People\nshould learn from our experience. It\u2019s a big responsibility, but we\u2019ll do it.",
        "A: It\u2019s a frightening thing, was it. With all the accusation, with all the -- the Communist, not\nCommunist, the thing -- all this -- this thing, it was mixed up and it -- and we went -- we\nwere there -- we came here and it didn\u2019t -- some of the things didn\u2019t even make sense to us.\nT-Turn around people upside down to make labels on them, to -- and it was -- it\u2019s like a\nreverse, like coming back. And it was -- to me it was a very -- a very -- a very frightful thing\nand a very worrisome -- not fright -- a worrisome thing.

And here I\ncame from down there and I know the people were very smart and I remember Mrs.\nRoosevelt in the 50\u2019s, went to the Soviet Union, she came back and she said, \u201cThere are\ncertain things we can learn from them. Their educational system,\u201d I remember distinctly the\nway She said it, \u201cwe can learn from them certain things.\u201d And it\u2019s -- and -- and I agreed at\nthat time because you know -- you know, if you want, like I think Eisenhower said it, if you\nwant to fight the enemy, you have to know your enemy. And there are certain traits, good\ntraits you have to learn from. And -- so this was -- this was a s-struck me a little bit f-funny.\nBut then, little by little, I -- I said, \u201cWe are a part of this universe and we are here to stay.\nAnd the choice\u2019ll be ours.\u201d",

And I understand what revolution right now in Germany 1s the\nbook by the author -- the author\u2019s name is Daniel John Goldhagen, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing\nExecutioners.\u201d Made a big like -- revelation in Germany. The youth at the third generation\nare as -- are asking question their grandparents. \u201cWhat did you do, why did it happen?\u201d\nThey find out the real -- the real thing about the past behind.

        "A: I felt sort of resentment about the Germans and -- and the Berlin wall I thought maybe\nwas the price they had to pay, maybe more so.

But I was a Polish national. And here we became criminals.\nAnd this is, yes the resentment I had. They help didn\u2019t -- the people gave us very, very little\nhelp. They paid a price too, afterwards. The revolt in -- in Warsaw ghetto, the -- in the war -\n- after the Warsaw ghetto, the revolt in -- in Warsaw. They start doing to the Poles, to the --\nto the -- to the Catholics, little by little the same thing. But they were already -- they already\ncut out -- they minimized already the Jews. They would have a bigger force to get together\nand fight their enemy, but they didn\u2019t use their heads. So I -- they betrayed us and I felt very\nmuch betrayed by my own countrymen.

        "A: Not -- I question. I don\u2019t know, I go to synagogue and I do my -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s more -- it\u2019s\npleasant, it\u2019s nice. When I came to the swartzva, I-I question it. How come? How did it\nhappen?",
        "A: It was -- it was changes happening and it was certainly interesting. You know, the -- the\nwomen -- equally -- what do we call it?",
        "A: The Equal Rights --",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, because it was interesting and it was okay. Sometimes they started asking\nme -- as soon as we are liberated? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t -- I -- we not -- we did\nnot use at that time the word.\u201d I guess I was. I was in my action. So I -- you understand? It\nwas interesting, because after I see the abuse in families and all those things with th --\nhusband and wife. We -- I never saw in our family, I never saw in my surrounding, where I\nwas in my little, in -- in my family down there, but then I start, you know, I heard it\u2019s all this\nabuse and all this -- this -- this -- this -- this bad things. So it was -- 1t was interesting. It was\nsomething moving, something going. It came a little bit mo -- to a lot of extremes, but it\u2019s\ncomes to the extremes and then it\u2019s levels off. And -- and in the 60\u2019s, we did drugs, I was a\nlittle bit concerned. I said, \u201cThis is bad.\u201d I used to tell my kids, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t need\ndrugs, just touch me. I\u2019m full of life, without drugs.\u201d I don\u2019t need it. You don\u2019t need to -- to\n-- to get -- to get the drugs to numb yourself. Why? Do you think this 1s something? It\u2019s a\ndrug in your body. I use to explain, but this was like -- like in style, like it comes like a --\nlike a yo-yo, it\u2019s comes like a thing and it\u2019s -- you know, the kids get involved and the\npressure in schools and all those things. And I used to watch my kids. I remember my\nmiddle daughter was a little bit a revolutionary. You know, more in -- in Los Angeles. And\nshe came when Woodstock came about. Woodstock. She came to me and she said she wants\nto go to Woodstock. I didn\u2019t know Woodstock from another city. Did I know Woodstock? I\nsaid, \u201cWho is going to Woodstock? What is Woodstock? Where 1s it?\u201d She start telling me\nsome -- it is in New York and kids are going. It\u2019s who is going and how many kids are\ngoing, some of your friend? I start asking all those questions and right away she start telling\nme a lot of kids, Woodstock, where is that? I said, \u201cNo, let them go, you are not going. No\nway, over my dead body, you are not going,\u201d I said. She was a -- a kid on -- a kid -- not -- n\n-- | don\u2019t remember how -- how old was she at that time when Woodstock was. I said, \u201cNo\nway.\u201d It\u2019s something I felt -- I sensed intuitively. There is a danger down there. And you see\nwhat happened. They almost -- it almost tump, you know, the stampedoed. There was not\nthe facilities, not even water -- drinking water down there for the kids. So I -- I sensed it,\nmaybe from my experience, or just I sensed it -- it\u2019s something wrong in that situation. Oh,\nshe started wearing those, I remember some kind of -- from a rag she made something. You\nknow, the Arab and the kids are all doing all those things. And it\u2019s also struck me funny, we\nhad beggars who used to go around with those things. And she thought she will talk me into\nsome nonsense, I said, \u201cNo way.\u201d But I let it, you know, freedom, I did not constantly, I\nsaid, \u201cLet her see it their own way. Let her see it\u2019s not the right thing.\u201d\u201d And somehow they\ngrow up, all of them, from --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: What is?",
        "A: No.\nexperience during the war of -- of doing something that many of us might consider being\nstereotypically male. You were fighting with a partisan group. You -- you learned how to\nride a horse and ho -- shoot a gun. So -- so in some ways, th -- would you say those\ndivisions didn\u2019t exist in your mind, of the male role and the female role?",
        "A: Not re -- I said it\u2019s another human being, I -- I saw it. And some -- and some girls did,\nsome attached themselves down there to some man. It didn\u2019t work out anyway. But they\nattached themself and it -- and it went from the office and it did not -- it did not work, it\ndidn\u2019t make sense. They thought maybe they\u2019 Il get her e-easy, I don\u2019t know what -- what\nmade them, what motivated them. You understand? But for my part, I saw it -- it was\nwrong. I\u2019m doing anyway, so what I have to -- if I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to. I saw them\nas another human being. And it was difficult. You know, it was still, you know -- but\nsomehow we didn\u2019t sense -- it\u2019s funny we didn\u2019t sense at that time, because the girls and the\nboys, we were -- we were fighting, like, the same fight. Maybe in other groups, in other -- I\ndon\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the way I was surrounding and I was.",
        "A: Yeah. After I heard, you know, the -- the -- what happened and what -- what they are\nfighting, you understand, you cannot just fight for something that\u2019s not in existence, but it\u2019s\n-- it [indecipherable] were abusing, where a man, you know this macho man, they thought\nthey are -- who knows, they are almighty. And -- and the woman had to stay home and --\nand -- and be like, you know, a little slave girl or whatever. And if they wanted, at will, they\nwould run around an-and she -- you know it was not a equal, it was not the right, the right\npartnership. It was not the right -- and this -- that I thought this is -- I agreed with that.",
        "A: For equal rights, yeah. I thought people -- people are people, they should have,\ndefinitely. They were oppressed. We used to see them oversea in Europe and we don\u2019t like\nit. And especially this [indecipherable] serve -- the way they beat them, the way they -- they\nkill them, the way they lynch them. And we were -- a lody -- a lody of the movies we saw in\nEurope. And this is -- it was re-revolting to me. I said, \u201cThey are people. They are\nstruggling, this their right.\u201d You know, they were not asked to be brought here into the\nStates. They were brought for the convenience at that time, for the white. Now they\u2019re --\nthey -- they\u2019re emancipated, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re free. So we should have -- I don\u2019t know, if\nhave respect for ourselves, we should have respect for the next person, if he wants to better\nhimself, if he wants to go out [indecipherable]. Not to keep him enslaved.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yes.",
        "A: Maybe some did. Some did. You know, n -- you cannot generalize things. Some did, a\nlot that did identified. I remember some -- this black kid went through and I felt this respect,\nplain. You understand, after I -- his respect, like -- like I feel the energy of that towards me,\nlike he touched me. And I felt 1t. And some other kids responded to me, but also white kids.",
        "A: Yes. I -- I know -- I don\u2019t know if I mentioned, but he was a black guy, yes and a very\nfine man. So, wherever I was asked to speak, I went to share my story with that. And I think\nI made a difference, I would say so, I think so. If I did anything good, so I\u2019m glad.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [indecipherable] friction amongst, you know, we\u2019re different -- different completely. It\u2019s\nlike rivalry sometimes, but, you know, deep down there, we do. You know, we went\nthrough the war. There were times where she almost gave up and I dragged her out, I pulled\nher out from a mess. But deep down there -- but there is some rivalry, something she would\ntell me and she doesn\u2019t mean it, and then I overlook things, I don\u2019t pay attention to her. Or\nmaybe I would criticize her more than I should and I shouldn\u2019t. Then later I find out. But on\ndeep down there, of course. She\u2019s now in Washington, so she -- my son, she\u2019s like second\nmother, you know and she\u2019s single now. She was married, divorced and she didn\u2019t want it,\nto be married any more. So we see each other when I come to Washington.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. Very much. The \u201867 war [indecipherable] it was very much, very much. I almost\nwas ready to go and to go down there and stay with my people. It was very hurtful and I\nlooked at the United Nation and we went away from the -- from the television, it was like a\ncircus on there. Like everybody would gang up on this little country and it\u2019s people, who\nwent through such a horrible time. And mostly a lot of people are composed from people\nlike me, survivors. And why again? Because of their oil? And this was very, very hard to\ndigest. But thanks God, I followed warias.",
        "A: I think the Israelis have to decide on that -- they are doing a pretty good job on that. I can\n-- | want it to be a nation that\u2019s -- historically it belongs to the Jewish people. From way,\nway, it\u2019s not from Pharaoh\u2019s time. And nobody can take away from that.",
        "A: That\u2019s possible? I think so. And they\u2019 Il make the enemy to understand and not to give in.\nIn my books, appeasement doesn\u2019t work. Giving in to the enemies doesn\u2019t work. As more as\nyou give, the more they want, too.",
        "A: Compromise is, yes. If -- if they are logical, compromise is yes. But what are we talking?\nIt\u2019s a little country, you understand? The logic\u2019ll fit. Let\u2019s say we are talking about iron\nprayer. The -- if we talk about, you know, I\u2019m not going 1n politics, I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m an\nAmerican, but this is a small country, surrounded all by the enemies. And they wanted\npeace. But let looks the other side, you have to be objective and look at it. And they, you\nknow, like -- this is a little bit, you know, not frightened -- Israel will be here forever. It\u2019s\nhere to stay. But it is a concern, yeah. It\u2019s a wonderful little country and it\u2019s democracy in\nthe Middle East and it\u2019s the only democracy and they\u2019re our friends. And you know, I\nwould talk about -- I always show a map, take a look on that teensy weensy Israel and\nthanks God for they\u2019re round me and they are strong. And my -- my thing, you see, during\nmy second World War, the experience, the way it were, if he would have been stopped, if\nHitler would have been stopped after he crossed Austria, the Anschluss and then you see?\nThe appetite came, in the Anschluss and then he started harassing Czechoslovakia. I\nremember we had a friend, a Czechoslovakian friend, she cried. I remember I stood next to\nmy mother, she cried with tears, poor thing, she was adorable lady. They had a -- a wursht\nstore, you know, from salamis? And they were such a neat people, grade -- we used to come\ndown there and buy for our grocery. And when they -- when they -- when they invaded\nCzechoslovakia, she cried with tears in her eyes. And you see what happened? They gave\nhim a free hand and what happened? So if he would have been stopped, he wouldn\u2019t have\nthe guts to do it -- what he did to a lot of people. And then he started harassing and we know\nit from history, what the next step was. So that\u2019s the way I see.",
        "A: First I was working for different organization, anything that was help out our people.\nThat\u2019s in Washington, doing the job. Israel Bond\u2019s, then I created a - a rummage store, it\nwas making money for the organization. I was working for years in there and then I got\ninvolved with your museum and the survivors group and the Bond\u2019s I guess too, they were\ninvolved. So this was my involvement in the organizations. I think B\u2019nai Brith I was once\nhonored with something, gave me some kind of plaque or whatever, way, way back. I don\u2019t\nremember what year it was. End of May -- argolot or something, I don\u2019t remember. And\nwhenever I was cold, I used to go out and tell my stories, especially at the schools. What?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: It was eight years ago, eight and ni -- \u201889, that\u2019s eight years ago. So -- yeah -- no, not\neight.",
        "A: Mm-hm, nine years ago, we moved to Florida and yeah, my husband retired, our son\ntook over the business and we had a little setback down there and he didn\u2019t wanted to be\ninvolved any more, it was too hard for him and so he decided not to mix in any more in the\nbusiness, our son took over and -- and he wanted very much to go to Florida, I was not\nprepared for it. Somehow, not mentally, not -- I thought all old people and I was not young,\nbut I was not mentally old -- in something, in my mind I thought that old people are going to\nFlorida. And it\u2019s not so. Then I find out it\u2019s not the -- the situation, because we -- we meet\npeople from all kind, they\u2019re good friends and -- and I -- I like it in here. Lifestyle, 1-1t\u2019s\nnice, it\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s nice. So --",
        "A: I had -- the paintings I arranged myself, I had -- I had a professional help, she helped me\nout the -- to put together things, but the paintings, I take full credit for them. I put them out\nthere all the way I saw it, the way I like it and the way they should be. And I think they --\nthey are in good order, the way I like it, I don\u2019t know, may -- how somebody would see it\ndifferently. But I -- I like it the way it 1s. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Turbulence.",
        "A: Yes. More so. I\u2019m constantly in demand of myself. Brenda, you have to -- you have to do\nmore, you have to -- you have to -- to go -- you have to do something. Something in me\ndemands out of me. I should more for the museum, more for this. I was invited maybe to\ncome, to speak to a group of young people. Pll go and do it. I -- but this is -- this is the\nthing, I said, maybe it\u2019s very important. I feel 1t\u2019s very important. And that\u2019s the demand on\nme. But are -- are -- are there ways? Yes, we live a peaceful life now. Of course, the every\nday worries, sometimes -- he worry about this, worry about thing, but this is normal --\nnormal -- normal occurrence, normal happenings in life.",
        "A: Be brave in any situation. We used to say in the partisan. Smele ova pulon nedbeerot. It\u2019s\nmeans a brave person, the bullet doesn\u2019t get him. You can die standing up or you can die\nlaying down. Not to be intimidated and nobody -- don\u2019t think that somebody -- we\u2019re all\nhuman beings and not to let yourself be intimidated by nothing and nobody. And stand and\nfight for the right, if you feel it right. That\u2019s my understanding of life. And we as survivor\nwill do our job. Never again will happen to my people, first, and to no people. What the else\ncan I say? For my children will have to have their own life and their own choices and I think\ntheir choices are right ones.
