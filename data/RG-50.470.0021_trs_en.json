        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage l\nAlfred Sundquist interview 2/13/95\nSWB: Tell me how you came across a camp during World War\nIl.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Well the camp was uh [ahem] about two or\nthree miles from town called Ludwigslozen. And I was with\n18th Airborne headquarters at that time, under General\n[ahem] Matthew Ridgeway. Now um, we're told that uh our\ntroops are advancing, had overrun a small concentration\ncamp. And being a physician and a major, I was told to look\ninto the situation and write up a report on it, and take\nwhatever action was necessary, which I did. Part of my job\nwas uh along the field of public health, so I might be on\nthat concentration camp for a couple of days, and then I\nmight be at a hospital where there were 1500 cases of\nTyphus, not typhoid but Typhus\u2019 fever. People with a\ntemperature of 105 for a couple of weeks. And um went to\nother hospitals, um, one hospital had a German general in it\nan- got captured him, [laughs] and took him back to army\nheadquarters alone[?]. That was essentially the uh type of\nwork that I was doing and concentration camp was a part of\nthat.\nSWB: Had you heard about them, did you know what you\u2019 were\ngoing to find?",
        "ALFRED SUNDQUIST: No I had no idea until I got there and\nSaw what was going on.\nSWB: Describe it to me, take yourself back and tell me how\nyou approached and what you Saw.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 2\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Well I [ahem] well I [ahem] I had a jeep\nand driver and we drove up to the concentration camp where\nthe barracks were, of course the Germans had left, had\nflown, and uh, looked around and I believe that the whole\ncamp was only on about three or four acres and there was no\nuh, there were no gas ovens or anything like that. Uh,\nthere was one place there where the dead were piled up like\ncardboard, and they wore these uniforms which were striped.\n[Ahem] And there were other people who were near death from\nStarvation. So apparently I don't know why the people were\nsent there, I didn't get involved in that at all, uh, in the\nbarracks, as I recall, now I'm 88 years old and what, and\nthis happened 50 years ago, but damned if I can forget it.",
        "It's so, it had such an imprint on my memory. The uh, the\nwire in the beds of the barracks was barbed wire, how they\ncould sleep on barbed wire I'll never know. [Ahem |\nStarvation causes a loss of teeth and a swelling of the\nlegs. And this was very apparent in those that were still\nalive. And uh there was cannibalism there and in the\nbarracks I saw evidence of liver having been eaten, human\nliver, they made a, opened up the chest and the lower\nabdomen and got out the liver, they could eat the liver when\ntheir teeth were gone, but they couldn't eat anything else\nwithout teeth. And uh, [Ahem], shall I just continue...\nSWB: Did the people who were alive, what did they do when\nthey saw you?\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Well there were two or three women there\nwho were in very good shape, and they were smiling and\nseemed to be very happy. I think that's probably because\nthey saw someone in an American uniform, and because they\nwere free now. Um, there were a few uh, they were lying on\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 3",
        "the ground, a few of the inmates they were lying on _ the\nground, in the last stages of starvation and death and _ uh,\num, I had to write up a report on this, and do you want me\nto continue this way [ahem] um so the question was what did\nI do about it. Well, I wrote up a report, went back to my\nheadquarters, and told them that [Ahem] made my recom\nmendations and said that the town of lLudwigslust is. very\nnearby and I sai- and they had apartment houses there and I\nsuggest we kick the Germans out of the apartment houses and\nmove the concentration camp people in there and feed them,\nand we had to feed them very carefully, just give them\nliguids, otherwise you give them too much they'll, you'll\nkill them. Well actually we lost 25 percent of them.\n[Ahem] there was a, a captain, a Dutch captain and he was a\nLunden Pole, a 1l- uh I me- I mean a Polish captain, and he\nwas a Lunden Pole, and of course of the Russians, just loved\nto get ahold of them Poles, Lunden Poles. And uh I\nsaid now look, I'm gonna have to leave here tomorrow, and I\nwant somebody in charge, and I'm gonna put you in charge of\nthis place. He said, but look, look at the uniform I have\non here, I can't be in charge with this uniform like this.\nAnd I said, don't worry about that, I had some enlisted men\nwith me, I said, look, go over to that apartment house, and\nget this, bring this man with you and get him five suits of\nclothes and make sure they fit him and look well on him. So\nthey did that. And uh, then uh, they came back the next day\nand the 82nd airborne division got involved in this. 82nd\nairborne was one of the divisions that was connected with",
        "the 18th airborne Corps which I was a member. And they had\na funeral for the ones that died, and everyone in the town\nof Ludwigslust, I imagine the town was about ten, twelve\nthousand people. Everyone there had to attend the funeral.\nThe men had to dig the graves, and there must have been\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 4\nabout uh, oh I'd say about 30 or 40 graves there, and the\ngraves were dug with such precision, that you wouldn't find\nan inch difference in the measurements of the different\ngraves. And uh, so they [Ahem] they were buried there and\nthe graves were filled with, and they put wreaths on the\ngraves. I had, I got a lot of pictures, took a lot of\npictures of uh, this camp. And I took a lot of pictures of\nthe funeral. And the reason I was able to take pictures was\nthat even though cameras were forbidden, the G2, a\nlieutenant colonel in our outfit, who was in charge of\nintelligence, was allowed to have army cameras. So I hada\npistol, and usually I hate guns, cause I'm a medical man,\n[Ahem], and he saw the pistol and he wanted it, he was\ndrooling for it. So, I said I'll give you the pistol if\nyou'll give me a camera with plenty of film. So he said,",
        "Okay. So I took pictures of that, and of the funeral and, I\nhave given those pictures to you and I hope you'll be able\nto use them.\nSWB: How do you think the Germans who participated in that\nburial felt?\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: You mean what was the...\nSWB: The Germans from the town, yeah.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: What was their reaction to it? I-I d- I\ndon't know exactly, it's awfully hard, I didn't ask any of\nthem how they felt about this. I should have, I wish I had\nnow. But I did take pictures of them and I have some close,\ndistant pi- and uh, close-ups of women's, one woman's\u2019 face\nand you can see in her face a look of sorrow, guilt, shame,\nit was all, I read her face that way and that was a close-up\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 5\npicture of her. The films were of good quality, by the way.\nPhotography was good, the G.I. camera took good pictures.",
        "SWB: Were you there when the inmates moved into those homes\nof the townspeople.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Oh yes, [Ahem] and [Ahem] we didn't have\nenough beds although we stole beds from the other\napartments, and let the people sleep on the floor, we hated\nthem they were Germans. And then, so we had to use straw,\nand I have a few pictures of patients sleeping on _ straw,\nl-l-lying on straw on the floor of this apartment house,\nwhich was now our hospital. And uh [Ahem] saw one of the\nmen smoking a cigarette lying on the straw in the apartment\nhouse, so we had to prevent them from smoking, and uh, we\nlost 25 percent of them died in spite of our treatment, they\nwere so far gone. I imagine that uh, we probably saved\nabout 25, 75 and lost about 25. It was a relatively small\ncamp, but a horrible thing oh God. I'll never forget it.\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: Can you describe coming up to the camp, as if you\nhadn't told me before.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Uh-huh, okay. Are you ready? Well\n[Ahem] our troops overran this camp and the word was sent\nback to our headquarters that the camp was there, and my\ncolonel, and I was a major at that time, and my colonel uh",
        "told me to come up and look the camp over and make a report\non it, and make recommendations. So I had a jeep and a\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 6\ndriver with a jeep and uh so we approached the camp in the\njeep and the camp was uh had uh barracks buildings that\nlooked like an ordinary army camp. Two or three barracks\nbuildings, open ground, and [Ahem] and one of the buildings,\nthere was an opening and uh, it looked as though it was a\nplace where they kept cord wood, but there wasn't any cord\nwood there, there's just bo- bodies piled up like cord wood.\nThat's one of the first things that I noticed. The other\nthing I noticed was people lying on the parade ground, two\nweak to get up, just barely breathing, there must have been\na dozen of those. And uh, [Ahem] then I was im- wanted to\nsee what was in the barracks. So I went into the barracks\n[coughs] and found that the beds were adjacent to each other\nand uh, there was barbed wire, the wire in- in the whole,\nthe whole-, I mean how they could sleep on a bed of barbed\nwire, I couldn't get any answer to that, maybe they didn't\nsleep there. But uh on, however, I saw in the barracks, on\nseveral occasions, several beds, bodies in which, in which",
        "there had been, had the chest and abdomen cut open, and\nSince these people under starvation had lost their teeth and\nhad swollen legs, and of course were very very underweight,\nskin and bones, starvation, they uh, there was cannibalism,\nand since they lost their teeth, they could only eat the\nliver without teeth, and it was apparent from several bodies\nthat the liver had been eaten.\nSWB: Was there a small? A lot of people talk about\nsmelling the camps before they got to the camps.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: There was, strangely enough, I have, in\nother places in the war I had been in confined areas where\nthere were bodies and there was a sweet smell of death, but\nthere wasn't that, at all in this camp.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 7\nSWB: How big was this camp, how many people were there.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: I- I would, I didn't count them but I\nwould estimate that uh the camp didn't hold over a hundred,",
        "a hundred and fifty people.\nSWB: When you were in the town, did you and your friends\nfind a bust of Hitler, can you tell me about that?\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Oh that was another experience outside of\nthe camp. [laughs] A brass bust of, just a head of Hitler,\nit was a hollow head, so we used that for a football, I\nkicked it up and down the street, in a town in Germany and\n[laughs] hoping that the people would notice it [laughs].\nSWB: Tell me that story again, where did you find that\nthing.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: I forget what the town was. I- [Ahem |\nsee in this concentration camp thing, this was only one of\nmy jobs, I had other, I was only there for about a day anda\nhalf, and uh then the [Ahem] then the army took over, I mean\nwe turned it over to the Army and [Ahem] I had to go to all\nthe, many different hospitals, and all the hospitals that\nwere overrun I went into to find out if there were any\nAmerican or British troops, and I told them, they told me to\nignore the French troops, but uh, Americans or British. And\nI captured the German general who was in one of the\nhospitals, took him to Army headquarters. That's a t- Oh\nand then there was another building where, where there were\n1500 cases of Typhus fever, not typhoid but typhus, where\nthey had a temperature of 105 for several weeks. And the",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 8\nGermans were shelling that building and the jeep driver and\nI had the building between us and leaving that the building\nbetween us and the Germans were shelling it. But the shells\nwent over the building and landed in people's yards, uh, r-\noh just-just a few hundred feet from where we were. So _ we\nwaited until this, waited for the shelling to stop and it\ndidn't seem to stop so I told the driver, I said let's. go\nand see it, just take a chance, so we did and nothing\nhappened. But [Ahem] that's, I had uh work to do in Italy\nand...\nSWB: Back at the...\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: There was a lot of malaria in Italy\nSWB: Did any of the people react to you at the camp, did\nany of them speak English, did you talk to any...\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Didn't talk to anybody except later on\nwhen we moved I talked to that uh Lunden Pole that I told\nyou about, uh...",
        "SWB: Let's get room tone of this...\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: ...Cause after, I mean fifty years later,\nyou don't think of those things. What you think about is\nthe horror, the horrible things\nSWB: Right, let's talk about that when we, let's roll again\nand talk about that.",

The actual trip to the camps, the",
        "roads we took and that sort of thing, that's, that's\nforgotten. The thing that I remember are the horrors of the\ncamp, the horrible things that I saw, the terrible terrible\nway that people were treated. Uh [Ahem] the starvation, the\nuh, these people had swollen legs, they were toothless, they\nwere gaunt, just skin and bones, some of them couldn't even\nget, some of them were lying on the ground in the last\nthroes of, just ready to die. And there was [Ahem] a uh\nplace where they used to have wood I suppose, piled up wood\nand here the bodies were piled up like cord wood. And um, I\ndo remember some of the people who were apparently were\nrecent arrivals, women, particularly and one or two men, who\nwere well-nourished and happy, and I think they were happy\nbecause they saw somebody in an American uniform which told\nthem that they were free. The-these things I can remember\nI- I can remember all the pictures that I took, you know it,\nan- and I have loaned you uh quite a few pictures, that uh\n[Ahem] show you what was at the camp. Better than my,\npictures will tell more than a thousand words, and _ these\npictures do tell you an awful lot. For instance there, at\nthe funeral, later on, funeral at Ludwigslust [Ahem] that\nthe 82nd airborne conducted. I took photographs of that,\nand uh I took photographs of the people's faces to see if I\ncould tell from their faces what their emotions were when\nthey saw these things. And I imagined, at any rate, I\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage 10\ninterpreted these, one woman's face being, showing unbelief,\nsorrow, guilt, shame, she was not very happy. ... And uh,\nso hard to understand how these things can happen. I don't\nthink they can happen in the United States. Do you have any\nmore questions.\nSWB: Yeah, tell me about the bust of Hitler.\nALFRED SUNDQUIST: Oh. [laughs] Somewhere in Germany, it had\nnothing to do with this camp that I was describing [Ahem] we\ngot a hold of a hollow bronze head of Adolf Hitler, a darn\ngood likeness too. And um mm we were walking the streets of\nthis town and we were kicking it and using it as a football,\nand the people were watching us and uh of course they\ncouldn't do anything about it [laughs] but, Hitler was a\nmanic-depressive, and Napoleon was a manic-depressive and\nhis periods of depression, in Napoleon's time, battles were\nlost, in the battle of Waterloo, he was in ae period of\ndepression. His faculty wasn't vital you know, as they are\nwith many do, when he's ina state of mania. And Hitler, he\nhad periods of depression too, and his judgement was very\nfaulty, but they, generals didn't dare to oppose him. But\nwhen he was in a period of depression, he uh just said,\nfight to the last man, or something like that, you know, and",
        "in Russia, an awful lot of Germans died- soldiers died\nbecause, the Russian winter, because Hitler was in a period\nof depression at that time. And [Ahem] we have, I think\nAbraham Lincoln was a manic-depressive and Churchill too.\nChurch-English Churchill was manic-depressive. Uh, Martin\nLuther I believe was too, the one that founded Lutheranism.\nSo that has a tangential relationship to this camp, beware\nof manic depressives [laughs]\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/13/95 ALFRED SUNDQUIST\nPage ll\nSWB: Now we need to record room tone again",
