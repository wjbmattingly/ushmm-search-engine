        "Abstract",
        "This is an oral history of twins, Rene Slotkin (born Rene Guttman [Gutman]) and Irene Hizme\n(born Renatta [Renate] Guttman), recorded on April 12, 1992 in Oceanside, New York.\nThe twins describe their stories and memories, starting from their birth on December 21, 1937 in\nTeplice-Sanov, Czech Republic, and continuing through their early lives in Prague, their\nexperiences in the camps, and their eventual immigration to the United States. Their father,\nHerbert Guttman, was arrested as a political prisoner in December of 1941 and eventually he was\ntaken to Auchwitz, where he died. In 1943, Rene, Irene, and their mother Ita were deported to\nthe Theresienstadt concentration camp and then later sent to Auschwitz, where the family was\nseparated and where their mother perished.\nAlthough the siblings were kept completely separate while at Auschwitz, both children became\nsubjects in Joseph Mengele\u2019s medical experiments on twins. Upon liberation, they did not\nreunite for several years, during which time they were sent to various homes and orphanages.\nThanks in part to an article in Life Magazine that contained a profile of Ms. Hizme, Irene was\nbrought to America by Operation Rescue Children and adopted by an American couple, the\nSlotkins. When the Slotkins discovered that Irene had a brother, they began searching for Rene,\nand eventually found him living in Czechoslovakia. The family adopted Rene as well, bringing\nhim to the United States in 1950.",

        "April 12, 1992\nOceanside, New York\nR: My name is Rene Slotkin. This is now April, 1992. I was born Rene Guttman [Gutman] in\n1937 in Tepice-Sanov (Teplitz Schoenau) which is in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic).\nWhat is your specific birth date?\nR: December 21, 1937. And I am not sure how long we actually lived \u2014 or how long I stayed in\nTepice-Sanov, but my first recollection is living in Prague. Um... Irene, you have something?\nI: Oh sure. My name is Irene Hizme and I was Renatta (Renate) Guttman, I was born the same\nday and I am a half an hour older than Rene. Um...I don\u2019t remember Teplice-Sanov but I do\nremember Prague and we lived upstairs in an apartment. We had a terrace\u2014 it overlooked a\nyard, um...I don\u2019t think it was a very big apartment. I kind of remember a lot of things being in\none room. Um... our crib \u2014 we slept in a crib \u2014 and it was in the room where our parents\u2019 bed\nwas as well. And someplace down always was a table. That\u2019s kind of all I remember. There was\na long flight of stairs to get upstairs.\nR: Yeah, the staircase \u2014 I remember that too. \u2018Cause I remember falling on the stairs once and\ncutting my chin and having a burning sensation when I was treated for it. And, lo and behold,\nyears after, after the war when I first remembered this, I looked and there is a little scar there.\nYou recently took a trip where you recall a certain streetcar or a trolley?\nR: Well, after the war, I returned to Prague because\u2014 because we had some friends who had\nsome documents and pictures of us when were much younger, before the war with our parents. I\ndo remember then seeing a trolley car with the number 22. I didn\u2019t know what was 22 at the time\nbut the image 1s 2-2. We followed the routes of the tram at that time \u2014 number 22 \u2014 and I was\nable to locate this particular apartment building and it turned out to be the right one, so that was a\nbit exciting. But even more exciting was being able to, at the time, to get \u2014 this must have been\nin 1948 \u2014 just before I started my trek to the United States, to be able to get actual pictures of\nmyself and Irene and my parents together. It sort of really gave me some roots for the first time\never\u2014 something tangible to be able to look at and know that I had a beginning and parents like\neveryone else.\nI: I have very sporadic memories of our childhood, but I do remember that we were beautifully\nclothed. We had beautiful clothing \u2014 matching outfits. You know there was always\u2014 I\nremember, particularly, we had these um... you know\u2014 not these, with bells on them so our\nmom could hold us with like a leash. Not a leash, but you know what I\u2019m talking about\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how you call that\u2014 how do you call that?\n3",
        "A harness\u2014\nI: A harness. And they had these little bells on them. I remember that very clearly. I remember\nalso very often going to a park which must have been near our home, with our parents. And most\nvividly, I remember, one time there was a huge storm and we went to the park afterwards and all\nthese trees had fallen down and we were climbing \u2014 you know like kids do \u2014 on them, walking\nalong the trees\u2014 it was really a lot of fun.\nR: The pictures are of us, our parents and ourselves in the park.\nI: We even have pictures in the park. And I remember \u2014 this is just something that came to my\nhead \u2014 I remember candy that we used to get. Like a marmalade, um... it\u2019s like the Passover\ncandy that they used to make. You know those Jelly... jelly kind of candies. I remember that for\nsome strange reason.\nDo you remember what they tasted like?\nI: Yeah, kind of orangey. That was weird, I just... we also had, we had a certain number of toys.\nAnd we used to play upstairs in the apartment, the one specifically I remember, we had punches\n(ph 058) like conductors on a train and we would play train a lot and we would punch the tickets.\nAnd I also remember having a doll, which Rene very nicely threw down from the balcony and\nsmashed to smithereens. Yes.\nWas that one of those celluloid dolls from the time or...\nI: Yeah...\nR: It was big.\nI: Yeah, a big doll.\nR: From that period, what I remember is being in the yard of this building and stepping on a\nbee\u2014\nI: Yeah, he was bitten\u2014\nR: And I was bitten by a bee and even now, when I think about it, my foot starts itching.\nI: Yeah, right on the bottom of your foot, I remember that so clearly, it\u2019s funny.\nDid they take you to a hospital or was it just taken care of at home, do you remember?\nR: I think it was just taken care of the way you would take care of a bite today.\n4",
        "I: And the other thing I remember so clearly, is when mom used to put us to bed, we played kind\nof a game. She would put our hands in a certain order and we would see if we could wake up in\nthe same position. Do you remember that?\nR: No.\nI: I remember that.\nSo you shared a crib?\nI: Yes, we shared a crib. You were on the... right.\nWhat have you learned now in terms of what your father did, in terms of his occupation?\nR: My father was in the export/import business and I think this somehow led to his accusation of\nbeing a spy\u2014 because I imagine that he had dealings with foreign countries. He was originally\nfrom Germany, the whole family is from Germany so this is what he was accused of, and I think\non the basis of that he was jailed and sent to the camps. My mother I don\u2019t know.\nI: Our mom, she also worked, she was very good in math, so I think she had something\nequivalent to possibly an accounting job, which of course, once laws that you couldn\u2019t hire Jews\ncame about, you know she was laid off. But she did have a good job.\nDo you know if you were a fairly well-off family or typical middle class or...?\nR: I can only judge by the clothing that we wore from the photographs we have, we can show\nyou. We seem very well dressed and our parents also.\nI: I think...by that time, our parents had fled from Dresden to Czechoslovakia where we were\nborn, but I think our aunts from Dresden kept sending us clothes. It was our aunt that sent us\nclothes. Because our parents could not buy anything. Because by then our father was out of work\nand so was our mom.\nR: In other words, after we left Germany\u2014 when they left Germany, that was the whole down...\nI: Yeah, they no longer had any source of support and it was our aunt that sent...\nWhen did they leave Germany?\nI: Well we were born in \u201937 so it must have been around then.\nI see.\nI: There are a series of letters between their father and the aunt in Germany\u2014 about ten letters\nthat we have, describing the children\u2019s behavior and how...\n5",
        "R: Yeah, that is terrific to have.\nI: Memories for the future... they are wonderful. They\u2019re in German.\nYou don\u2019t know specifically what your father imported and exported?\nR: No.\nBut he was arrested in Czechoslovakia, I see. Do you have any recollections of his being taken\nOr...\nI: I do. I definitely do, again, not clearly but, one night, there was a knock on the door, a very\nloud knock\u2014 and there were soldiers who had come and they came to take our father away. I\nremember our mom was crying. We didn\u2019t know what happened. It was late at night and we\nnever saw him again after \u2014 at least I don\u2019t...\nR: I just remember what she said. It was a disturbing event, it did happen but that\u2019s about it.\nAbout how old were you at the time?\nR: I would say four.\nAnd are you the only children of your parents. No brothers or sisters?\n(Silence on the tape for a few seconds)\nAny other memories that you would like to talk about?\nI: Something in the letters, maybe? I can\u2019t recall the letters. I do remember at some point that we\nused to stand on line to get food\u2014 I sort of remember that. Um... the people stood on line.\nDo you know if your family was religious?\nI: I have no recollection.\nR: None.\nDid relatives ever come to visit you in Czechoslovakia, that you recall?\nR: No\nI: I do remember once though, that in the summer, it must have been summertime, I don\u2019t know\nwhen, but we went someplace where there was water, like a beach. That\u2019s all I can remember.\nR: It would have to be a lake.\nI: Maybe a lake, I don\u2019t know but I remember being...\n6",
        "R: I don\u2019t remember it. See what thirty minutes makes? A big difference.\nOne of those memories...(everyone laughs). Well, you have good recollections of being injured\n(to Rene). What do you recall about the changes in Prague or changes in your life once the\nGermans occupied? Or what is the first significant memory you have of a real change in your\nlifestyle?\nI: My first significant memory is waiting to get on this train to go someplace. It was a nice train\nthough, you know it was like a sleeper or something, with windows.\nR: I think that was Theresienstadt that we were going to. I remember too, chronologically\nspeaking, that is the next memory after. Because the previous memories, it wasn\u2019t a good life... a\ngood existence, I don\u2019t think.\nI: Umm, it was, I think I... as a child, I sensed something was not right but...\nR: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nI: Our mother was rather sad.\nR: \u2018Cause I don\u2019t remember my father, obviously my mother\u2014 she would have to have been sad.\nI: I remember a certain sadness, but the next thing, as I said, was really this train ride to\nsomeplace else to live.\nR: That was Theresienstadt.\nI: That was Theresienstadt.\nDo you remember taking anything with you, in particular?\nI: Well, we did have some stuff but... I... this is... I... the only thing I recall is that I had a\nlocket. I had a locket that I... a heart, and I remember having that for a long time even when I\narrived in Auschwitz and I was very brazen. We would stand on line for the showers and we\nwould have to strip naked and I had enough presence of mind to know that I had to take this\nthing off and I would hold on to it. I don\u2019t know how I did it, but I did it. I lost the locket\nhowever, somewhere.\nWhat did the locket look like?\nI: It was a heart shaped locket. It had pictures inside of it\u2014 I don\u2019t recall.\nThis was a gift from your mother?\nI: It must have been, probably.\nYou don\u2019t recall taking a toy with you or umm...?\nR: The only thing I remember was my mother\u2019s shoulder and the texture of the dress that she\nwore.",
        "7",
        "On that day, or...?\nR: Not on that day, but from Theresienstadt. That\u2019s one of the things \u2014 since you asked us\nsomething tangible \u2014 this 1s what I do remember. And I think there was a picture taken\u2014\nI: Picture taken of us\u2014\nR: Picture was taken of us at that point in time and\u2014\nI: We have the picture.\nR: Yeah, we got the picture and you know, it confirms this shoulder that I was leaning on. We\nhave it right here. And, but I don\u2019t remember taking anything with me, like a personal toy or\nanything like that. No, I don\u2019t.\nSo you remember how her dress felt?\nR: Yeah, it was coarse...\nI: But I do remember that our mom did carry a bag with something. That I remember but I don\u2019t\nknow what was in it really.\nDo you remember anything about the train journey itself, and getting to the train station outside\nTheresienstadt?\nI: Actually, the train ride was kind of... I don\u2019t know, I enjoyed it. I think it was maybe our first\ntrain ride. It was a pretty nice train ride. It wasn\u2019t bad, as I recall, that trip to Theresienstadt.\nR: I have a blank on that.\nYou do? You don\u2019t remember the march to Theresienstadt? What are your first memories of\nTheresienstadt?\nI: Unfortunately, I think I have very minimal memories of Theresienstadt. Again, only, I\nremember cobblestone roads, pavements, brick buildings, I always see these bridges over water,\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from there, I don\u2019t know, but that comes to mind.\nWere you staying with your mother there? Were you still with her?\nR: Yes, yes. I remember you being sick there (to Irene).\nI: It\u2019s possible, I was sick a lot...\nR: Over there, I do remember you being ill.\nWas she taken away to the hospital in the camp or...\nR: To some infirmary but she didn\u2019t stay overnight or anything. She would just go there and\ncome back.\nI: And in Theresienstadt, I also remember standing on line and I remember the carts with dead\nbodies.\n8",
        "R: Yeah and on the cobblestone too.\nI: They just... yeah.\nR: Hard pushing, the wheels would get stuck between these rocks and everything would come to\na halt and they would have to get everybody on the side to get this thing started again, rolling and\nthey lost a few bodies every once in a while, that rolled off.\nI: Umm...\nDo you recall what your day to day life was like there? Did you... there was an underground\nschool. Do you recall ever getting taught...\nI: I can\u2019t recall. I think we were too young for the school. I am not sure we attended. But I don\u2019t\nknow.\nR: I don\u2019t recall.\nI: I don\u2019t recall it at all. Well recently, there was a film made about Theresienstadt and in the film\nfootage, which we saw in the Village just this year, there was a kindergarten, and on the bottom\nsteps I spotted Rene in the film, so he was part of the kindergarten group, whether they were\nactive or not. It was part of the Nazi propaganda film footage.\nOh, I see.\nI: I don\u2019t recall.\nR: I don\u2019t recall either. It 1s possible.\nI: It is possible. And I don\u2019t know if you recall this, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an (?? ph 14) time\nfor me, but at one point, do you remember standing in a field, just for hours and hours on end, I\ndon\u2019t know for what. No? It is just something that is kind of flitting in and out of my head lately,\nbut I can\u2019t exactly recall...\nR: I remember something, it was fields, it was dark, was dark and I think we were waiting for the\ntrain to Auschwitz.\nI: No that\u2019s a different...\nR: That\u2019s a different... \u2018Cause I remember taking quite a walk towards that train.\nI: Oh yeah, I remember that too, but that, no, this was just a lot of people were there and we were\njust kind of standing around waiting.\nWell that did happen. There was an occurrence like that where many people were taken out of\nthe camp and held in a field, in a forest outside of Theresienstadt.\nI: Really?\nYeah, so this is what I have read and what I have heard from other survivors.\nR: And what was the purpose of that?",
        "9",
        "Well actually, last night Inge Auerbacher talked about that too, for what she remembered, she\nwas an older child, that it looked as though they had plans to kill everybody. You know, she put\nit, \u201cBabi Yar style,\u201d you know, shoot people into mass graves, but it didn\u2019t materialize for some\nreason \u2014 luckily \u2014 and everyone went back to the camp, back to Theresienstadt, so that might\nhave been\u2014 it might be that you recall.\nI: Hmm. Well, on occasion, that is how they handled epidemics. There was some kind of disease\nand they couldn\u2019t handle it, well that would be their medical solution.\nAnd actually, before the film, they did deport many people also, before they filmed the\npropaganda movie. Because they knew that it was too crowded. Do you remember if your\nmother was with you all day or did she leave you during the days as if to go to some kind of\nlabor detail?\nR: I don\u2019t think that she was with us all day but I ... I do remember running wild in the place. I\ndo. And I\u2019m throwing things into windows and from windows down, and I\u2019m sure that happened\nwhile I was unsupervised.\nDo you remember if you were with other kids?\nR: Yeah, yes. War games, I guess you would call them.\nI: Don\u2019t you remember drawing, some inkling of memory, I think you once mentioned to me. I\ndon\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t come to me at this moment. The head of the children\u2019s school was in your\ntransport from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and his name I forgot but it will come to me in a\nminute. Very influential person, because he kept such a wonderful spirit among the children\nthere and um... I think that when I mentioned it to you once, you did remember drawing.\nDo you remember any thoughts you had about these wagons with dead bodies, I mean, did you\nthink it was interesting as a child, do you recall any thought you had then?\nI: My thoughts were that I didn\u2019t understand it, didn\u2019t understand what it was but I...\nR: I don\u2019t think that it made the emotional impact that 1t would to somebody a lot older. \u2018Cause it\nwas just something... we were learning new things and I think it was just another thing for us to\nlearn.\nI: It was life, whatever it was, that is what happened to some people.\nDo you have any memory of wearing a star?\nI: I don\u2019t.\nR: I do.\nWhat do you recall about that?\nR: Hmm.\nDo you recall getting it, or do you just recall wearing it...\n10",
        "R: I just had it. I don\u2019t know where even. I don\u2019t know... where would that have been.\nProbably in Prague.\nR: In Prague, yeah, yeah. Very small, but it was there and \u201cJuden.\u201d I remember people pointing\nto us because of it but uh... it\u2019s the first trme I ever...\nI: Mentioning Prague, I just remembered something. And probably \u2014 maybe this didn\u2019t even\nhappen \u2014 because Prague was never bombed was it? I remember sirens, I remember sirens and I\nremember that we would go downstairs\u2014 must have been Prague because where else would I\nhave gone downstairs?\nWas this a large building that you lived in? Many apartments or do you know...?\nR: Not terribly, I would say like six, seven stories. Right?\nI: Yeah, something like that.\nR: Going down...\nI: Yes, yes. And all the other people in the building went down too\u2014 there were other people\nthere too. Yeah. Was there food down there or any provisions?\nR: Would this fit?\nYeah, it could. I don\u2019t know off hand but it might.\nR: It is very vague\u2014 very misty.\nIn your home, did you speak German? Do you remember?\nI: I think we spoke German. Because I seem to understand Yiddish after the war and I couldn\u2019t\nfigure out how, so\u2014 it had to be.\nAn early implant\u2014\nI: An early implant from someplace. See, the grownups thought that I didn\u2019t understand what\nthey were saying but I understood.\nR: Seemingly, we understood but I don\u2019t remember what language, but when anybody spoke,\nespecially the Germans there, I knew exactly what they were saying. So that would have to be.\nBut I am sure that since we grew up in Czechoslovakia, that we must have learned that too\u2014 the\nfirst few years.\nI: But see...\nR: Or you don\u2019t think that we were out all that much?\nI: No, I don\u2019t think that we were out and I think that you learned Czech after the war, because I\nhave no recollection of Czech at all, German yes.\nR: I don\u2019t remember the language, I just remember understanding.\n11",
        "Do you remember, do you have any memories of any of the S.S. guards or the soldiers? What\nthey looked like or um... treatment of other people or of yourself?\nI: Well the first recollection that I have of the S.S. \u2014 I guess \u2014 or the soldiers or whatever, was\nwhen we took this very long walk in Theresienstadt to the train that was to take us to Auschwitz.\nR: There were dogs there...\nI: And they had dogs there. It was a long column of people who were marching, it was at night,\nthere was snow on the ground and it was very, bitterly cold. And if people didn\u2019t walk quickly\nenough, they would shoot them. They would just shoot the people. There were shots that rang\nout and I just saw bodies kind of falling. I don\u2019t know \u2014 again \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I really\nunderstood that they were dead or that they weren\u2019t going to get up again and there were dogs\nand I remember that I was kind of tired and I didn\u2019t want to go on this trip\u2014 my mom...\nR: Our mother held us by our hands, pulling us,\nI: Pulling us...\nR: I remember that.\nYou were being roused awake or...\nI: Well, it was at night...\nR: It was at night, but it started... at the evening, 1t was probably... it wasn\u2019t an arousal in the\nmiddle of the night, it was something that was ongoing in the evening...\nI: And it seemed like a very long walk, but that might have been that we were so little...\nLittle legs\u2014\nI: Little legs, 1t seems that the transport card, which was posted on the wall in Theresienstadt \u2014\nand that is when you knew your time had come to go. We recovered these transport tickets and\nthey are in a museum in Israel, in a kibbutz \u2014 Givat Chaim Yihud \u2014 they have a whole slew of\nthings about Czech-all the Czech families that were in Theresienstadt and that\u2019s in fact, where\nRene and I found an affidavit that indicated that our mother had died in Auschwitz.\nR: And our names are there\u2014\nI: Our names\u2014\nR: With dates of birth are there, everything is there.\nI: And what transport numbers \u2014 the numbers that we had on the transport \u2014 to Theresienstadt\nand from Theresienstadt and to Auschwitz and the dates.\nR: December 15\u2014\nI: December 15 to Auschwitz...\nR: To Auschwitz\u2014 1943.\n12",
        "I: To Theresienstadt it was August.\nR: About a year-August\u2014\nI: 1942. Or September 9, I am not sure, I always get confused.\nR: No it was August...\nI: Yeah, it was August.\nR: A little over a year...\nI: There was also another artist that was on that same transport \u2014 and he has drawn account after\naccount of what happened that night \u2014 and you can see 1n his black and white drawings the pitch\nblack of night and the entrance into Auschwitz \u2014 the spilling out of the prisoners from the cattle\ncars \u2014 and it\u2019s a very clear image of what they actually went through. Bernard... um... I forgot\nhis name.\nThis photograph of you two and your mother, where was this taken, do you remember?\nI: Theresienstadt\nR: Theresienstadt\nWas there...do you remember why it was taken, did there just happen to be a photographer in\nTheresienstadt?\nThey were doing these things...\nI: Doing these things and I think they sent it out to family members to say \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re fine.\nEverything 1s great.\u201d\nDo you think that this was probably done early? Do you recall that it happened shortly after you\narrived in the camp?\nR: I couldn\u2019t say. We were there over a year, empirically, knowing this now. I don\u2019t recall.\nI: It is hard to tell.\nR: But looking at us, I would say that we looked pretty good\u2014 so\u2014\nI: So it might have been early.\nR: Early.\nDo you have any memory of the clothes that you were wearing?\nR: No, I remember what my mother was wearing \u2014 how it felt.\n13",
        "I: But I remember... my hair.\nR: I remember your dress... that dress... colors.\nI: I remember that dress.\nR: Sort of reddish, purplish...\nI: Reddish, purplish right. Yeah. And I remember\u2014\nR: \u2014and there was yellow lines, right??\nI: Yes! Yes!\nSo the squares are purplish?\nR: Yeah, basically a purplish background, they were like squares and also like yellow.\nI: See that.\nR: But obviously this is the first time ever that I am remembering this.\nI: But I remember that my mom always made me a thing on top of my head...\nR: Yeah the long\u2014\nI: I had long hair and she always had... yeah right.\nWhat was your mother\u2019s name?\nR: Ita.\nAnd so you recall walking to the transport to Auschwitz, and the dogs and the guards shooting\npeople who were straggling I guess.\nOr beating them, or yelling and the dogs barking. Yeah, they just had to get the trains loaded.\nI: It was horrible.\nR: Yeah, it was our first real display of real uh... force against the people \u2014 that I remember.\nI: It was horrible.\nAnd your mother was pulling you along? Had you by the hand.\nR: Yeah. She had two of us, she couldn\u2019t carry much of anything else right?\n14",
        "I: But she also did, she still had something. A small parcel of some sort.\nWhat do you recall about the transport itself?\nI: That was horrible.\nR: That I remember. Uh... we were absolutely jammed into this car, I can smell the stench of\nwhat went on in there. Everything went on in there. And we were there for a very, very long\ntime. People were trying to faint and fall down, but they almost couldn\u2019t because\u2014\nI: It was so crowded, you couldn\u2019t turn around or anything. It seemed like an endless journey.\nJust an endless journey.\nYou were all together in a car.\nI: Yeah, with lots and lots of other people. There was nothing to eat. I remember being very\nthirsty. I remember biting my hand.\nWhat did biting your hand do?\nI: I wanted to cry but I knew that\u2014 I didn\u2019t dare cry, I think\nR: That was really a strange environment, we really didn\u2019t know what was going on. This was so\nunnatural.\nI: I didn\u2019t understand what was happening.\nR: Heard the clickety click of the train rolling, just on and on and on.\nDo you remember anything about your mother on this transport? Anything that she was doing or\nsaying to you?\nR: She was up there\u2014 I was down.\nI: Yeah, she was standing.\nR: She was holding us close, that is all I remember. There wasn\u2019t any contact.\nI: I kind of remember hanging on to her legs.\nR: Yeah right.\nI: I remember that I wanted to sit down. I wanted to sit, but there was no space, you couldn\u2019t turn\naround.\nDo you remember other children on the transport?\n15",
        "R: No.\nDid your mother have any food with her? Do you recall her passing any bread to you or potato\nor...?\nI: I would think that she must have had something but I don\u2019t remember.\nSo this journey took quite a while? Several days?\nI: At least a day, I would think. We arrived December 18, so it took three days.\nR: I think that there were people who died on that ride.\nI: Oh, there were.\nR: Because, when they opened the doors, they were lying, there was no movement down.\nYou remember that?\nR: Yeah. The stench was unbelievable. That I can smell every once in a while, actually.\n\u2018\u201c\u201cHeraus\u2019\u2014 it was German again and the dogs and \u201cschnell,\u201d \u201cmacht schnell.\u201d And again your\nmother had you\u2014 you were thrown out of the train?\nI: And miraculously enough, we stayed with our mother. There was a whole Czech Lager, a\nspecial family Lager for the Czech families that everybody stayed together-men, women and\nchildren. It was a special\u2014 from December to March, we stayed together.\nSo, other twins have recounted them yelling for twins, \u201cZwilling, Zwilling\u201d (ph 445). Do you\nrecall that?\nI: We heard that also but it didn\u2019t mean anything. Well\u2014 maybe it did but I don\u2019t... because I\nremember that we went with our mother to the hospital to be... whatever\u2014 to be checked out\nand the reason I remember this \u2014 I love to tell this story \u2014 the reason I remember this is because\nhe (Rene) was such a cry-baby when it came to doctors. Now, I was scared that he was going to\ncry and that they were going to beat him up or hit him, because I was such a stoic. (Laughs)\nSo somebody examined you two and your mother?\nI: I remember that she was with us, one time, she was there with us. But that might have been\nwhen they knew that we were twins.\nDid you two, did you know you were twins? It might sound like a silly question, but...\nI: I don\u2019t think so.\n16",
        "R: No, no. It had no meaning. It took on meaning later, I think, when we were separated and I\nfirst got into the group of the male twins that I realized I was a twin. Even then, I wasn\u2019t sure that\nI knew that it was different than being just a normal kid. But what it really meant uh...\nSo after it was \u201cHaraus\u201d out of the cars, you were taken directly to this Lager?\nI: This barrack, yeah, this Lager where all the other Czech families were and my recollections of\nthen are really\u2014 again, we were with our mother, there was very little food\u2014 I remember we\nused to get a piece of dark, black bread and um...some kind of slop to drink\u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nsomething that tasted awful and but I recall seeing people beaten in that Lager, I don\u2019t know\nwhy. But...\nWere there just women and children in that Lager or did it seem like whole families were\ntogether?\nI: I think it seemed like whole families were together. But I am not... what do you recall?\nR: I don\u2019t have any recollection of any of this until we were separated and then I start to pick up\nmemories. Because I was totally on my own then, and then I really had to... it seems like we\nwere really guarded. I just don\u2019t remember any of the outside things that happened.\nI: I remember, sometimes we had to stand outside in the mornings for something or other-when\nour mother was there-I don\u2019t know.\nAny other recollections of your day in this Lager? Do you think you were just in there the whole\nday or...until these Appells came about?\nI: [have no...\nR: Not in that period. I start remembering after we were separated, I started to have day activities\nand then I start remembering our morning roll calls uh... I remember the bigger and older were\ntaken off to work and uh...\nWhere were you taken then? You were removed...\nI: At some point, I think it was in March of that year or April or whatever, maybe in June...\nR: \u201844\nI: No, it was \u201843\nR: No, \u201944. We got there in...\nI: That\u2019s right, December \u201943, so sometime in \u00b044, I recall one particular terrible day when I just\nrecall that we were ripped away from our mother and I recall a loud scream and um... I knew\nsomething\u2014 something had happened. You know, something was happening that was terrible.\n17",
        "Was it your scream that you heard or...\nI: I think it was my mother\u2019s.\nR: I think it was my mother\u2019s.\nI: She was trying to hold on to us and we were just grabbed...\nR: Pulled away from her\u2014\nI: Pulled away from her and...\nThis was within the Lager?\nI: Yeah, inside. And then the next thing I knew, I was in someplace different with just other\nwomen and girls and Rene wasn\u2019t there anymore and my mom wasn\u2019t there anymore.\nHow were you taken to this new place? Do you remember, were you walked, or did they put you\nin a truck or...?\nI: I don\u2019t recall.\nWhat are your recollections about this? (To Rene)\nR: Same. The very same. And then I was just there in this new surrounding-it was very close to\none of the ovens \u2014 the Crematoria \u2014 because I saw people walking in constantly\u2014 one way. And\nthat is where I start remembering how my days were \u2014 hunting through garbage for a potato and\nseeing these daily beatings in the roll call lines in the mornings. Also, very vividly, I remember,\nprisoners \u2014 the Russian soldiers and the Polish soldiers \u2014 they were shot. They were lined up\nagainst the ditch and they were just shot. And the children \u2014 I was just six years old \u2014 we would\nlook over the pit and see some of them still twitching and I remember pulling \u2014 not me, but some\nof the older boys \u2014 they pulled one fellow out who was obviously still alive but he did have a big\nswelling in his head \u2014 which had to be a bullet most probably \u2014 and they took him into the\nbarracks and put him on one of the bunks. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. But these things\nhappened almost daily \u2014 the shootings. Somebody was always being shot. There I also remember\nthe sirens \u2014 they were more frequent occurrences as the war grew \u2014 the sirens and the hum of the\nairplanes above and always an S.S. trooper standing in front of the barracks at the time, outside.\nI am just going to pause this for one second.\n*START OF SIDE TWO (2)-COUNTER 625\nSo Rene, you were taken from your mother and brought to Lager B-2B uh...how were you\ninitiated into the new Lager? What do you remember first about coming there? Did anybody\nshow you the\u2014",
        "18",
        "R: Yeah, there was concern by older people who were like me \u2014 they were twins, this I know\nnow \u2014 and one of their big concerns was getting me a pair of shoes.\nYou were barefoot at the time?\nR: I must have been, or maybe they didn\u2019t fit or something. I needed shoes, and somehow they\nmanaged through the black market to get me shoes for a loaf of bread. I even remember the\ncolor of the shoes \u2014 they were a yucky brown, you know \u2014 up to here. They covered the knee\u2014\nno, not the knee, the ankle. And they were like, you know, a caramel color brown. But they were\nalmost like brand new and so I felt like I was being taken care of, but it was a totally different\nexistence. I was really... my eyes were opened, I questioned like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cWho is\nthe master of this?\u201d I remember asking, \u201cWho is in charge here?\u201d You know like who can I ask?\nWho can I talk to? And in the background, all the mornings, the cold, the hunt for potatoes in the\ngarbage and the endless lines of people walking to this...and...\nDid you go around with other twins or the other people in the... the other children looking for\nscraps?\nR: I always remember being alone. Totally alone. I know they were there but the hunt was\nalways alone.\nDo you remember a time that you were especially successful in finding something to eat? A\nsubstantial piece of bread, a whole potato?\nYeah, these moments happened, but I had to go inside and have it cut up so that I could warm it\non the stove inside.\nYou warmed the potato?\nR: Yeah, there were moments. They were wonderful moments when you found something that\nyou could really eat but nothing really substantial like finding a box or anything like that. Maybe\na big potato that wasn\u2019t totally rotten\u2014 that was a find.\nYou mentioned that you were questioning many things. Did you... what did people tell you or...\nwhat did you ask about this procession going into the gas chambers?\nR: I never asked that, that was just something that was happening. But I asked, \u201cWho is the\nmaster of... who is the master of the world?\u201d I think I asked. I was told \u201cHitler\u201d Okay. I was\nsatisfied. That was an answer.\nThe prisoners answered you that.\nR: Yeah. And part of, I guess, daily activity \u2014 I have to retell \u2014 1s the sleeping thing at night. On\nthese bunk beds and (??ph 55) and so close to the wood, smelling it and also getting pushed\nand many times, just being able to squeeze in someplace, to have a space. But alone.\n19",
        "Did you always sleep in the same approximate spot?\nR: I was just asking myself the same question. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t recall. Do you\nremember anything about that in your...?\nI: Well, you know, my memories are a little different than Rene\u2019s. But we did have bunk beds as\nwell, and there was this long oven down the center, and I think we were somewhat assigned to\nbeds, but I am not sure that everybody always went to these same beds. I particularly remember\none night, having to get up and having to go to the bathroom\u2014 well, not that they had bathrooms\nbut... outside in the back, and then coming back and getting totally confused as to what side of\nthe barrack my bed was on. And I really got into a state of panic, but I knew I had to get into a\nbed, and I kept going over\u2014 you know, I would go over and ask somebody if I could just come\nin next to them, and I remember being pushed away and them saying, \u201cThis is not your bed.\u201d\nAnd the more his happened, you know I just was panicking, and so I remember climbing over\nthe oven and saying well maybe... I was so confused. And finally somebody had pity on me and\nlet me come in with them.\nWas anybody taking...did anybody \u201cadopt\u201d you?\nI: No. There was just no kind of organization of any sort. It seemed to me that most of the girls\nwere older. I didn\u2019t really see too many\u2014 certainly not younger than me\u2014 I don\u2019t recall. And no\none seemed to be in charge and I... I remember particularly being extremely, extremely lonely. It\nwas like the worst thing. There was no one. And I remember that we would receive bread and\nsome soup, and I tried to save my piece of bread, I figured that if I held on to it longer that I\nwould have it for the whole day. But then somebody always stole it from me at night. Now, I\ndon\u2019t know if it was somebody else or it was the rats who ate it, but I never had it in the morning.\nAnd um...did I learn? No, I did this every night. I remember that there were two girls that were\nwith me and they had little pouches, and they used to hide their bread in the little pouches.\nIt was a separate pouch?\nI: Yeah, a little thing... I... and I would say, oh I wish I had one of those\u2014 but I didn\u2019t. Um... I\nvividly also remember going to the hospital. And being sick. And I remember standing\u2014 that\u2019s\nwhen I remember standing for roll call\u2014 that was in Auschwitz in the morning\u2014 almost every\nmorning.\nOnce you were in that Lager...\nI: Yes, definitely. And I remember it distinctly because I always tried to hide behind somebody\nbig so that I wouldn\u2019t be seen, so that I wouldn\u2019t be chosen for anything. I didn\u2019t question \u2014 I\nhardly spoke to anyone \u2014 but I was beginning to comprehend from what I was hearing that\nterrible things were going on\u2014 that whatever was happening was terrible. Although to me at this\ntime\u2014 this was life and I didn\u2019t remember anything else. I didn\u2019t think this was wrong, right or\notherwise. I just knew that if I wasn\u2019t spotted, I wouldn\u2019t maybe get chosen for something and\num...I remembered that I could \u2014 from out of the door of the barrack \u2014 I could, at some point... I\nremembered that I had a brother, and I remembered that he was to the right\u2014 this way. And if I\n20",
        "looked out this way, then his barrack was there. And I remember this on a night in particular\nwhen there was some kind of explosion and there was a big fire and I was terrified that his\nbarrack was the one that was on fire. Um... I remember often seeing people run into the fence\nand uh...get electrocuted. And I remember on one particular occasion\u2014 and there were dead\nbodies on the ground, I remember one time trying to hide among these dead bodies. I don\u2019t\nexactly know why\u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was I was scared of, I think I just wanted to disappear\nand thought that maybe this was a good, convenient way to do it.\nThese were bodies outside the barrack, stacked up or...?\nI: Yeah, just...right. And I thought that this way, I could hide somehow and it would all be over.\nI don\u2019t really know what went through my mind. It was a child\u2019s idea \u2014 you know \u2014 be still like\neverybody else and no one will notice me.\nWhat about the other children in that particular Lager?\nI: There were some older children but I again\u2014 it seemed like they hung around with each other.\nSo now, later on, I know that they were other twin girls, so I guess that they hung around with\neach other. I didn\u2019t have my twin\u2014 because he was... we were not of the same sex so it was a\nlittle harder. But throughout all the time in the hospital and through experiments and through\nhorrible times, I always felt that Rene was alive and I said that I have to stay alive to take care of\nhim. This was like my mission in life and I very clearly remember umm... standing on line \u2014 it\nwas always cold, of course \u2014 and we were going into the showers, standing naked and again. I\nbring up the locket \u2014 for a long time, I was miraculously able to hang on, hide the fact that I had\nthis locket, and always put it back on after I came out of the showers. I also remember that\nsomehow I knew already that not everybody came out of the showers, so every time we were\nlined up like this, I remember that fear, like oh my God, is this the last time?\nAfter the shower you would be lined up?\nI: No\u2014 before. Before.\nWhat happened when you got sick?\nI: I was in the hospital.\nDid you get yourself to the hospital or...\nI: I think somebody else must have. Periodically, I was taken to the hospital because I had certain\nmedical procedures I guess, done to me\u2014 like\u2014 again\u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly why, or what\nfor, or the very detailed specifics. But I can remember that, at one point, I had blood taken out\nfrom my neck. You know... I don\u2019t... but it is vivid because it was extremely painful. And\nanother time, I was strapped to a table of some sort, and there was a doctor \u2014 he was in white and\nhe had a scalpel. Well, I didn\u2019t know it was a scalpel then. I realize it now that it was... and\num... he cut me. And I remember also being x-rayed. I remember a lot of x-rays, kind of stuff\nand of course being measured and stuff like that. But I also remember \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what\nthis has to do with anything \u2014 but wires. Wires attached to me and um... something with\n21",
        "electric... I don\u2019t know. And, I remember, um... remember seeing in one room\u2014 in some room,\nI don\u2019t know... there were eyes. Don\u2019t ask me\u2014\nLike eyes? Just independent eyes?\nI: I don\u2019t know. But I also remember getting injections that made me very sick because then I\nfound myself in kind of a hospital bed or something and um... I remember throwing up a lot and\nhaving diarrhea, and I was extremely sick. I remember though that there was some nurse there\nwho kind of looked after me, and I think there was one point when they were cleaning out the\nhospital. I don\u2019t know\u2014 again, now, they were probably just going to kill everybody, I am not\nsure, but there...it was a very hurried kind of thing. There was a big commotion and this person\ngrabbed me and just stuck me under her skirt and it was all dark and she just said be quiet. You\nknow\u2014 she didn\u2019t have to tell me twice and um...I think she saved me, I think she saved me\nfrom something... I don\u2019t know.\nWhen the doctor cut you, do you remember anything about it?\nI: I just remember I must have fainted or... I don\u2019t remember anything else after that except\nwaking up in a lot of pain.\nAnd during any of those examinations, you were never with Rene?\nI: No. The only time I remember being with him is when we went with our mom that time. I\ndon\u2019t ever remember being there again with Rene. \u2018Cause I never saw you again after that. At\nleast I don\u2019t remember seeing you.\nR: I was there a couple of times, but nothing like... at least I don\u2019t recall\u2014 the only thing I recall\nis being measured, the touch of the very cold instruments and the word \u201cRunken\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s x-ray,\nI think, in German. I remember that. So there was a lot of that going on but that\u2019s about all.\nWhat were the measurements?\nR: Around the head, body, head, everything. Because they were sort of trying to... they were\nputting you in between something, to see how, I guess how big\u2014 it wasn\u2019t like they were taking\na tape measure, they put you against something cold, steel\u2014\nI: There was steel, it was very cold.\nR: Very cold.\nWho was the person doing the procedure? Um, did they talk to you or ask you anything?\nI: Um, I just remember being terrified, and I knew that I had to just not cry and just do\neverything that I was told. No matter what.\nWhen you were... How was it that you knew you were taken to be examined? Did, one morning,\nsomebody\u2014 soldier come in and take you, or did you know that on a particular day you would\ngo?\nR: I was walked over by one of the older boys. I am sure that I was the youngest kid there. I was\nwalked over by one of the older boys and that was it.\n22",
        "Do you have a recollection of the \u201ctwins\u2019 father?\u201d The gentleman Zvi Spegel (ph 202)?\nR: He could have been the one. I know of him only in... 1985, I learned of him. I met [him] in\nIsrael, Zvi Spegel.\nDid he remember you?\nR: No. I think his mind was sort of on the blink at that point. But there was somebody else in\n1985 who remembered me, which was very heartwarming.\nI: And he was part of Zvi Spegel\u2019s group.\nR: And he was part of that group so obviously I was there.\nSome of the other male twins have described seeing each other... seeing the Soviet prisoners in\nthe next half of the barracks. Do you recall any older men there?\nR: Yeah. The only... the Soviet... the soldiers, I remember they were periodically shot, they\nwere the ones that were always taken and disposed of... the partisans (ph 214)?\nI: Do you remember Adolph (ph 215)?\nR: No. But the only one I would remember is that young kid\u2014 that one other one that I met in\nIsrael.\nI: Peter Grainfield?\nR: Yeah. Peter. Very vaguely. I met this man in Israel and he was the only one that would have\nbeen my size.\nI: He was about a year younger.\nR: And that was extremely young. Because I don\u2019t think the older boys would\u2014 even socially\nthey wouldn\u2019t associate with us. Because I think that the next up was at least three or four years\nolder and at that point, that 1s a big difference so\u2014 we were alone, except that I was told that I\nplayed with him. And I kept looking at him and uh... I sort of... it stirred some memories, but\nnothing specific. Nothing specific really. What I was going to say... You were asking about who\ndid some of the experimentation \u2014 the Museum at Auschwitz now has the documents, which we\ngot copies of, of our names \u2014 both our names and numbers \u2014 matching and all that. Irene has a\ndocument where there is a signature of blood testing and Mengele\u2019s signature on the bottom of\nit-so he could have been one of the gentlemen who participated in this-pretty sure.\nThey took blood from you as well?\nR: I don\u2019t recall them taking blood from me, no.\nBut you recall the x-ray procedures?\nR: I recall the x-rays and measuring, that I remember. The other things...\nDid these x-ray procedures take a long time?\n23",
        "Time didn\u2019t have much meaning to me. It just happened.\nYou both had numbers? You were both tattooed?\nR: Yes.\nWhat do you recall about receiving those numbers? Was that when you first entered Auschwitz\nor when you were transferred to the separate Lagers?\nI: Since our numbers are so different, I would imagine that it must have been when we were\nseparated because we had totally different numbers.\nR: Yeah, my number, I remember it being put on, it hurt. There was an awful stench all around\nme, it was muddy and it was like a needle pricking me, but in terms of time, when they put it, I\ncan\u2019t put it anywhere.\nYou said it was muddy. It was done outside?\nR: It was muddy when I walked up to... yeah, it was done outside. Whoever it was, they were\nsitting at a desk with a cover over it but I stepped into it like from outside. And um... Ill show\nyou my number, I have a very clear number. It reads this way: 169061. And that\u2019s confirmed by\nsome of the records. But when I first saw that number with my name next to it \u2014 also, only in the\nlast few years \u2014 that really gave me the chills again, confirming dreams, memories of long, long\nago. Which still affect you, I guess. I\u2019m sure they do.\nDid anyone tell you that you had to be accountable for this number in some way?\nR: You know, after the war, which is really\u2014 for children, I think, the hardest part\u2014 this is like\nanother Holocaust starting or use... That\u2019s how I look at it. I took an awful lot of beatings\nbecause of this number because that identified me as a Jew, in Czechoslovakia, after the war,\nwhen everything was supposedly very nice and good. There was no relief for children who...\nseven years old, all alone. I mean parents can appreciate this sort of thing. When you become a\nparent you will understand.\nIrene, do you have recollections of receiving a number?\nI: I drew a blank on that. I do remember just vaguely, a needle jabbing my arm but I didn\u2019t make\nanything of it. I just saw that everyone had one of those\u2014 I wanted one also. I wanted to be like\neveryone else.\nYou described an explosion you heard. Do you recall this explosion\u2014 fire coming out?\nR: No. But my feelings about Irene being alive, the way that she felt, I felt that too. And I do\nremember seeing her once, through the wires, and I knew it was her... it had to be. Some time\nhad elapsed since we were separated, uh... I think it was toward the end, but I knew that she was\nalive because of that\u2014 I just knew that she was alive. That just confirmed the whole thing for\nme\u2014 that she never died in my thinking\u2014 she was always alive in my consciousness until we\nmet in the States many years later.\nWhat are your next memories about Auschwitz?\n24",
        "R: Well, just prior to liberation, there was this incident of us being taken and almost done away\nwith by another officer other than Mengele and uh... very clearly do I remember this incident.\nAnother doctor?\nR: I don\u2019t know if it was a doctor, an officer. And I remember Mengele coming in just in the nick\nof time in his green convertible and stopping this whole procession, and I also remember \u2014 and\nIrene I guess had that feeling many times \u2014 I knew that this was going to be deadly. I mean this\nfear instinct I guess \u2014 I had a feeling that this could be the end for me \u2014 and the horrible feeling.\nSo Mengele stopped this. And also, towards the end of... there was this march that we all went\non, that they marched us out of... I mean, the last week or so\u2014 weeks... again, time 1s\nmeaningless\u2014 but I do remember a lot of excitement among the German soldiers and distant\nartillery fire getting louder and louder and them taking us on to this march\u2014 that was a pretty\ngruesome type affair because they \u2014 again \u2014 shot anybody or just... anybody who\nwouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t continue they just...\nThis was January, 1945?\nR: This was January. Right. And that was a long, long haul if I remember. I can\u2019t put it in terms\nof hours, but then all of a sudden the German soldiers were gone and the Russian soldiers were\naround us \u2014 in white uniforms. I remember one officer being on a horse \u2014 I think it was a pink\nhorse (laughs). A very big\u2014 huge animal. But they were all dressed in white and that was the\nliberation.\nSo you were en route on the march? You hadn\u2019t reached anywhere in particular?\nR: No, no.\nAnd you realized that people were being shot if they were straggling behind?\nR: Yes.\nDo you remember making a conscious effort to\u2014\nR: Yes. I had to keep going, and she was my strength, and I knew I had to make it for her, as was\nthe case for many of my other hardships that came about later. She gave me the strength to keep\ngoing.\nDid you have a blanket with you or anything?\nR: Don\u2019t recall.\nDo you recall getting any bread rations before the march?\nR: Nothing. I do remember the Russians marched us into a warehouse of some kind after this\nhappened and there was a tremendous scramble for food. I wanted to get in on this. I do\nremember getting a can of some kind and rolling it and then I finally got somebody to open 1t\u2014\nit was sauerkraut. That is my memory of this thing \u2014 big yellow, yellow, golden kind of a can \u2014 it\nwas huge to me then. I don\u2019t know how big it really was, but I had to roll it, I couldn\u2019t lift it.\nSurely, you ate it?\n25",
        "R: I had something of it. A lot of people didn\u2019t do so well because they overate, I understand.\nThat was liberation from Auschwitz.\nAnd for you Irene?\nI: I went...I must have been at a different camp (laughs). Kind of towards the end, before\nliberation as I know it now, I sensed something had changed. Uh... there wasn\u2019t\u2014 suddenly\nthere wasn\u2019t this order in the day anymore. We weren\u2019t being put outside, we weren\u2019t standing...\nsomehow there was no order anymore and I \u2014 at that point \u2014 was, I must have been quite sick\nbecause I remember just that I was on the ground. I couldn\u2019t get up. And there were other people\nalso lying on the ground \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was because they were hungry or sick or what. I do\nremember something had changed\u2014 I wasn\u2019t quite aware of what\u2014 but there seemed to be\npeople who were kind of a little bit... saying that we\u2019re saved \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what that meant \u2014\nand the next thing I knew was that I was picked up by some Polish lady and she took me.\nWithin the camp? You were still within the camp?\nI: In the camp, but she took me out of the camp. So I was not part of this march \u2014 you know, that\nwas not me \u2014 I was already gone. And um...I was with her a while.\nWhere did she take you?\nI: It seemed she lived in Auschwitz, in the town proper, and she took me to her house.\nFor how long did you stay with her?\nI: I was there until Rescue Children extricated me. It must have been...\nThis is an organization?\nI: Yes, an organization to get back Jewish children. But um... I remember Christmas very\nvividly, so I was there at least a year. I remember her telling me that Santa Claus is going to\ncome out of the moon\u2014 she says to me\u2014 I believed her. Yeah, right!\nDid she have other children?\nI: No.\nIt was just her? Was she married?\nI: Um...I think she was married, but I was an only child.\nI guess, I suppose you learned Polish?\nI learned Polish.\nAnd when did this relief organization find you and take you?\nI guess about a year later and um... I first went to Prague to an orphanage and then I went to\nFrance to an orphanage and then a different orphanage blah, blah, blah... a lot of orphanages. I\ngot shuttled around a bit.",
        "26",
        "And Rene, after liberation and the warehouse, what was your...\nR: The next recollection I have, I understand that I was in a hospital in Bratislava \u2014 so I am told \u2014\nand I had some TB \u2014 tuberculosis \u2014 a touch of it. And the next... the memories for me, really\nbegin in Czechoslovakia in a town called KoSice (Kaschau) (ph 390), in an orphanage. A big\norphanage in a hospital complex.\nWas this specifically a Jewish orphanage?\nNo. There were nuns, Mothers, around taking care. And uh... there was an administrator there \u2014\na doctor Kelina (ph 395) who, after some time, took me out and uh... with his wife\u2014 they had\nno children, and I lived with them. Subsequently, they had a child\u2014 Did they have a child? Or\nam I mixing it up with the other one?\nI: They didn\u2019t have any children.\nR: No, they did not. I am mixing him up with his brother. I lived with him for a while and they\nhad to flee because somehow the Communists... somebody made some statements regarding this\nman and he just got wind of it and he had to flee. So he left me with his sister and that\u2019s the\nfamily \u2014 the Mann family \u2014 and lived with them for a good number of years. They were the ones\nthat had the other children, Bebe and Otto (ph 410) and they treated me very well. There I went\nto school \u2014 in Czechoslovakia \u2014 but there again, I was the only visible Jew and they were waiting\nfor me everyday after school with stones.\nSo the other Czech children...\nR: There was one other Jew, I remember, but we both had to run for our young lives at the time.\nAnd it was a good thing that we were still young and so the people that were waiting for us\ncouldn\u2019t do all that much harm. They were still youngsters also, but they were serious and they\nwere mean\u2014 so we had to run. I mean that after we were let out, we had to...\nSprint home?\nR: Sprint home, very fast, sprint a long way too, because I lived very close to the school, they\nknew \u2014 they blocked my way \u2014 so I had to go somewhere else. It was always a big circle\u2014\nsometimes it led into the fields.\nWhat was the name again?\nR: Koyista (ph 429).\nAnd the family\u2019s name?\nR: Mann.\nM-A-N-N?\nR: Yes, M-A-N-N, Joseph Mann and...\nI: Edith.\n27",
        "R: Edith, yes.\nThis was the sister...\nR: The sister yes, of Doctor Kalina.\nUnknown Woman: Just as an interesting point, later on we found out from people in New York\nCity here, that the search for the Jewish children that had been taken for a million reasons into\nPolish homes \u2014 Christian homes \u2014 the way that they discovered who was a Jew in these homes\nwas that the rescuers would go to the town Bishop, or whoever was the religious cleric in the\ntown, and they would ask for all the baptismal certificates of the children. And if there were four\nchildren in one home and three baptismal certificates, the fourth one was the Jew. And they\nwould exchange monies, or whatever the town needed \u2014 the Bishop I am sure was paid also \u2014\nand then the children were rescued. So, because of that, the American Jewish Organizations were\ntrying to raise funds to have monies to pay for these children and through one of these\norganizations called Rescue Child, they were having dinner after dinner,\nI: It was called Rescue Children.\nUnknown Woman:...Rescue Children, Inc., one of them \u2014 the prime mover of this \u2014 was a\ngentleman from Long Island and he, he went into Europe to one of his orphanages that had been\nset up for all these rescued orphans and he found Irene in one of them. And he said, \u201cOh, you\u2019d\nbe perfect to come back to America and just help us raise funds.\u201d This was just, like, your picture\nperfect orphan\u2014 with beautiful, full banana curls and a sweet face. And somehow he convinced\nher that she should come to America with him. and subsequently, she was made part of this Life\nMagazine article \u2014 Nov. 17, 1948... all about... 1947... right, that\u2019s how Irene was taken out of\nthe Polish home, by the way. One of these emissaries of Rescue Child... Rescue Children Inc...\nI: Well I\u2019m not sure, there were other organizations that worked in Poland. I think that Rescue\nChildren came into the forefront later on when many of these children were in France and they\nwere trying to find their parents here in America\u2014 find relatives for them or else ship them to\nIsrael or whatever. But when I was in Poland, you know Rene was talking about school \u2014 I was\nin \u2014 she was obviously a Catholic lady\u2014 I was in all Catholic school and I went to church...\nR: So did I. I went to church.\nDid you know that you were Jewish?\nR: Yes. I went to the end of the line. Many times I snuck away when they went to church, but\nmany times I did go and went through the whole... whatever I went through.\nI: I went to Church. I knew I was Jewish because I had this number on my arm. I also was\u2014 as\nRene said, I also was\u2014 getting very sick. Because I lay in bed, and I remember doctors coming\nand flitting in and out of fever, or whatever. And um... she was a very strict lady. I had to feed\nher bunny rabbits\u2014 she had rabbits. Which she would then cook. I couldn\u2019t eat them because I\nwas taking care of them. And, in the summer, she had family that lived out on a farm, and I\nremember that it was a very long walk\u2014 it took almost half a day to get there. And there were\nother children there and I hated going there because they made fun of me because I had this\nnumber. And nobody defended me and I cried. I cried a lot.\n28",
        "What would they say to you?\nI: They made fun of me because I had this number\u2014 that I\u2019m a prisoner of some sort, they kept\nsaying. I cried a lot. But, with everything, when the Jewish organization \u2014 which might have\nbeen the Joint Distribution... uh I don\u2019t know...Distribution Co., came to pull me out of that\nhome, I had really come to like being Catholic. I thought it was like... nifty. You know, Church,\nthe whole bit, rosary beads. And I didn\u2019t want to leave \u2014 you know I really did not \u2014 I was very\nupset. I remember the first orphanage where I came to, I met somebody who I am still friends\nwith to this day \u2014 her name is Miriam, she lives in Israel. And she was about seven years older\nthan me, and she kind of became my mother figure\u2014 but she had also had... was from Poland\nand we were both sitting there with the Rosary beads plotting our escape from this orphanage\nbecause we wanted to go back, you know.\nBack to Poland?\nI: Right.\nThis was when you were in Prague?\nI: Yes.\nSo they removed you to Prague and from Prague you were taken to Paris.\nI: Yeah, I was outside of Paris in 525, and that\u2019s where I was selected actually by Herbert\nTenszer \u2014 he used to be a Congressman from here \u2014 and he chose me to come. And he promised\nme that he would send me back\u2014 promised. He didn\u2019t keep his promise.\nSo you came to New York at that time?\nI: Yeah.\nAnd Rene, you had an exodus out of Europe also?\nR: Well, my exodus really tied to...related to her being taken in by somebody who lived out here\non Long Island. A friend of Herbert Tenzer \u2014 was widely active in the organization \u2014 Mayer and\nDina Slotkin \u2014 which is my name now \u2014 Rene Slotkin. And they took Irene in and that had to be\nmaybe like \u00b048.\nI: Yeah, it was at one point before I came to them, I was with the Novicks, and they dragged out\nof me that I had a brother. Because I had never spoken about it and...\nR:So they took Irene into their home, right here in the Five Towns, and then they started to\nsearch for missing Rene. And it is a long and fascinating story but uh... Life Magazine was\nsomehow instrumental in locating me because this Dr. Kalina that I mentioned, had escaped. He\nhad gone to Israel and somehow...\nWas he Jewish?\nR: Yes. And he had gotten hold of this Life Magazine, and 1n it, he saw Irene as Irene Guttman.\nThe names clicked and he put it together \u2014 so he got in touch somehow with somebody here in\nNew York and told them that I was living in Czechoslovakia with his sister. And they \u2014 the\n29",
        "Slotkins \u2014 sent somebody over into Europe to get me out. And there was a lot of red tape, I had\nto go through Germany and documentation and Switzerland for a while\u2014 not a direct route, and\nuh... I finally ended up...\nI: 1950\u2014\nR: 1950, March 29, in Idlewild Airport, rainy night\u2014 I'll never forget that and we were reunited\non that evening.\nSo you remembered your last name. There was no reason why you should remember that your\nlast name was Guttman, but I suppose you did.\nR: Well, why? That was my name, all the way through until... that was always my name\u2014 I\nknew my name.\nI: The Polish lady changed my name from Renatta to Ivenka (ph 588). So that\u2019s how Irene came.\nUnknown Woman: Zvi Spegel also reinforced everybody\u2019s identity in the camp\u2014 for the boys.\nHe would have the boys... a newcomer come in right away, and they were greeted in like a circle\nand everybody would introduce themselves so their names were constantly being reinforced and\nwho they were.\nEnd of Tape | counter number 598\nTape 2\nI: It is only in retrospect now that June is talking about it a little that I do remember when I was\nin Poland, that every once in a while we would take this long walk \u2014 it seemed like a long walk\nto me \u2014 and we would shift through this mountain of ashes \u2014 looking \u2014 she told me I should be\nlooking for gold. And it was just... I couldn\u2019t stand doing it... 1t was just...\nSo these were crematory ashes then?\nI: It was just the worst. The worst. It was horrible. And in the town where she lived \u2014 right across\n\u2014 her apartment kind of faced this village square \u2014 but to the right, down the road, was where the\nRussian soldiers were housed and I recall that she would sometimes send me there with things\nto...\nTo trade or what?\nI: I don\u2019t know what, it was always wrapped up. So she would make me go there, and I hated\ngoing there because I was afraid of these Russian soldiers-although they were very nice \u2014 I was\nscared of soldiers \u2014 it was a soldier and my recollection of soldiers was not somebody that I\nwanted to deal with \u2014 not after Auschwitz, so it was very scary for me \u2014 but she would make me\ngo. I have no idea what transpired.\nR: I do want to say one thing about the Slotkin family. That it is amazing to me now that I am a\nparent and have children, that they had the willingness and uh...the charity to extend themselves\nto a war orphan like Irene and then not knowing at all what I would be like, certainly a\nquestionable background. And to spend these huge amounts of funds to send somebody to\n30",
        "Europe to get me, to bring me over here and to adopt me at the age of 12... I am not sure that I\ncould do it, knowing where I came from. I just don\u2019t know\u2014 I really have to say that these were\nthe most marvelous people to be able to do such a thing. And uh...I think that there are other\nstories like that too. The Jewish community really went out at that time, once they knew what\nwas going on really and in the open and things like this and I think that this should be known. I\nthink the atrocities of what happened should be known, but I think that some of the good things\nthat came about should also be publicized.\nWhen did you learn what became of your mother? Or did you seek out the information, did you\never confirm what happened to her?\nR: It was confirmed in \u201985, when we went to this museum in (ph 034), Israel. But I think I knew,\nright then and there when it happened.\nWhat about your father? Did you ever find out when and where he was sent? Was that ever\nobtainable?\nR: It was found out.\nJune: Sometime in December 1941, he was taken to Auschwitz, because the records came\nback\u2014 one record that we have of his demise says December 1941. And he might have been one\nof the earliest prisoners that actually helped at Birkenau. That was when it was being built. They\nsent it political prisoners at that time and he fit that bill.\nBecause of his import/export background?\nR: Therefore accusations of spy activity.\nUnknown Woman: It seems that he was the first sent to the Petschek (Petschkuv) (ph042) prison\n\u2014 which was actually the Petschek Palace and the Nazis turned it into an interrogation prison\nfrom where no one ever returned. We learned... got this from other people who lived in\nCzechoslovakia at the time and we met them in 1985.\nR: I do remember going with our mother to a place with packages.\nUnknown Woman: Maybe you went to visit.\nR: Maybe. I don\u2019t remember visiting or seeing, but I do remember going to this very sound,\nfortress-like structure and bringing packages.\nUnknown Woman: There\u2019s a marker outside the Petschek now with the names of all the people\nwho went through there\u2014 so it\u2019s possible that their dad\u2019s name is on it.\nWhat was his name?\nR: Herbert. Herbert Guttman.\nThere are some documented stories from some of the other twins, at least for the boys, about\nplaying\u2014 being taken to a field to play soccer.

I played\nsoccer after the war in Czechoslovakia, a little bit like a national pastime, like baseball is here.\nUnknown Woman: One of the older twins who talked to us in 1985 \u2014 and he just mentioned \u2014\nthat Rene was shepherded by this communist. Zvi Spegel set each person in kind of a pecking\norder. This twin had to take care of that twin, or this person had to take care of that twin and\nsince Rene and Pepe \u2014 Peter Grainfield \u2014 were the youngest, they were given an adult male, and\nthis fellow was named Otto, and he was the one who kind of kept Rene away from the wires.\nInterviewer\u2019s Notes:\nDoorbell rings, Mrs. Slotkin (mother) enters.
