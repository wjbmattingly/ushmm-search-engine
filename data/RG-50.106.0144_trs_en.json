And there\u2019s a real big\nconnection with us because when we went back to Germany in 1996 or seven, we\nwere able to go into the backyard of a home where in -- into the -- our old home,\nand the present owner said, look, there\u2019s a platform, a cement platform that you\nused for some kind of Jewish holiday. So after all these years, the cement platform\nof our Sukkot -- sukkah, was still there. And as a matter of fact, we went back this\npast summer to show it to my oldest son, and there it still was.",
        "Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood?",
        "A: We lived in a small town outside of Cologne that had many Jewish families, but\nthey were interspersed in the town. There was no such thing as quote, Jewish\nneighborhood.\nOctober 17, 2001",

        "A: At that time it was called Lechenich, but today it is called Erfstadt. And it is\npart of a huge county. There was -- there\u2019s Erfstadt-Lechenich, Ernstadt, all these\nlittle towns are now under Erfstadt, E-r-f-s-t-a-d-t.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: What are some of your earliest memories?",
        "A: Basically they start with when I had to go to school. In the town that we lived in\nthere was no Jewish day school. And I started school in 1935, and for the first year,\nthe first six months I would say, I went to the public school. And then the edict\ncame down that Jewish children were not allowed to go to school any more, and I\nhad to go to school in the town where my grandmother lived, and I had to go and\nlive with my grandmother. Couldn\u2019t live at home any more. In order to go to school,\nI moved there and went to school there.",
        "Q: And the name of that town?",
        "A: That town is called Linnich, L-i-n-n-i-c-h. And it was a -- maybe 45 minutes or\nan hour\u2019s ride away. And I don\u2019t think I was a happy camper, but being with my\ngrandmother and not at home, it was all right. And I went to school there for a -- for\na year. And then my -- my aunt and uncle also lived with my grandmother and they\nOctober 17, 2001\nemigrated to Holland. And my grandmother went to live with another daughter and\nI had to go home and I then went to school in Cologne, which was a half hour, 45\nminute train ride or bus ride from where we lived. So I commuted every day as a\neight, nine year old, by train or bus to Cologne to school, on my own.",
        "Q: What kinds of things did you study?",
        "A: I was in a Jewish day school. I had -- we had all Jewish studies and also all\nsecular studies. And I went there through what you would call here, maybe fourth or\nfifth grade.",
        "Q: When you were a child going to school, what did you want to be when you grew\nup?",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t know, but I was always playing around with the thought of being a\npediatrician, but it never went any further than that. But I do have to backtrack and\ntell you that I was a feisty little girl, and coming off the bus one day there was this\nsnotty little kid that called me dirty Jew. And I went after him and beat him to pulp.\nAnd after I had done that I got scared and I ran. And between the bus stop and\nwhere we lived, one of my father\u2019s cousins lived. So I ran to his house to hide. But\nhe got his dues for calling me dirty Jew. He never called me dirty Jew again. And I\nmust have been eight or nine years old.",
        "Q: Do you remember other episodes of anti-Semitism?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Yes, very vividly after Kristallnacht in 1938, we had to leave our home and we\nmoved into an apartment in the city of Cologne where three uncles and an aunt,\nbrothers and sisters, all of whom were unmarried, lived. And it was like a two or\nthree bedroom apartment and I don\u2019t know how -- remember how many people\npiled in there. But now I was supposed to walk to school. And I think most days I\ndid, but the teachers thought my Hebrew education was sadly lack-lacking, and\nsuggested that I have some extra lessons. And my mother arranged for me to have\nthem after school. Inevitably the teacher would call and ask where I was. And my\nmother said, well isn\u2019t she there? And no, she\u2019s not here. I was roaming the city of\nCologne and there were all these stores that had the signs in the window, Juden\n[indecipherable], meaning Jews not wanted. And that\u2019s the line I would stand on,\nand they were selling coffee with an eighth of a pound. And my grandmother, my\nmother\u2019s mother, was very ill. She had cancer, and her only joy was a cup of coffee.\nSo many afternoons I would come -- I would have stood on five, six lines and I\nwould have come home with a pound of coffee. That\u2019s where I was, standing on\nline somewhere or taking the streetcar and going to a bakery and pick up a piece of\ncake for my grandmother. But I never told anybody where I was going. I was just\nroaming the city and I -- I always got back home.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: Before Kristallnacht, did you experience any other anti-Semitic verbal or\nphysical attacks on you?",
        "A: N-No. There was a lot of discussion at home between the adults, but they tried to\nshield the children from it, so really, no.",
        "Q: When you say they tried to shield you, how did they shield you?",
        "A: By not talking about any of their problems in front of us. It was always hush\nhush. And that\u2019s why I have so few memories.",
        "Q: Were you aware that something was wrong?",
        "A: Yes, we always lived in fear. We didn\u2019t have a normal life. We didn\u2019t go on\nvacations, we didn\u2019t go on picnics, we didn\u2019t go to the movies. It was not a normal\nlife as you would know it here.",
        "Q: Did your family ever think of leaving Germany, even if -- I\u2019m talking about\nbefore Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Yes, my father very much wanted to leave Germany and he did have a visa\napplication number y -- that everybody had to have, a quota number. But the quota\nnumbers were very, very high for Germans at that time, and there was very little\nhope for us. We were working on it, but it didn't go as fast as you think it would.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: In the time before KristallInacht, do you remember any book burnings, or do\nyou remember any of the -- w -- you\u2019re shaking your head, I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t pick\nthat up on the microphone.",
        "A: Sorry. No, no, not at all. No. I was a little girl. No. We li -- we were sheltered.\nMy parents sheltered us. My sister\u2019s memories are so different. She remembers that\nshe was never allowed out. She was younger and they kept her hidden, they kept her\nindoors. I just went out on my own.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that comes to your mind about the period of time before\nKristallnacht?",
        "A: Very vague, small things that I really can\u2019t put together to make any sense.",
        "Q: Were you able to see or hear anything on Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely. I -- my parents, living outside Cologne, and I don\u2019t think\nradios were very much in use at that time, sent me to school that day. And I went to\nschool the way I usually did and when I got to the school, the -- the Gestapo or\npolice, I don\u2019t remember, I ca -- I still can\u2019t tell the difference between one and the\nother, were standing in front of the school with German Shepherds. And they told\nus, children there is no school today, go home. And the school was right next door\nto a beautiful synagogue, and we could see that the roof of the synagogue was burnt\nout. And we went home -- we got on the train, went home, and when I got home my\nOctober 17, 2001\nmother said, well, what are you doing here? And I said, well, th-they sent us home.\nThey said there was no school today. It must have been 11 - 12 o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. That time my uncle had a very good school friend who came to the house\nand said to my family, whatever you see or hear today, do not leave your home. Just\ndon\u2019t leave the house. In other words, he must have known what was going to\nhappen and he told my uncle not to leave. So, around three, four o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon we hear that the synagogue is burning, the fire engines ran. We saw the\nsmoke from the home. My cr -- grandfather had been president of the synagogue for\nover 20 years and th -- his natural thing was to run to the synagogue to save the\nbooks, to save the Torahs. But my father and uncle would not let him leave. And we\nsaw all this and we decided -- my grandmother at that time had a broken ankle, so\nher leg was 1n a cast. So my parents decided it was time to get out. Every other\nJewish male in the little town that we lived in, ran to the synagogue. They were all\npicked up and put in concentration camp. My parents and my uncle and three\ncousins who lived in the next town over, all decided to go to Cologne. These are all\nthe people that filed into this apartment. And a non-Jewish man drove us, my\ngrandparents, my sister and I, drove us to Cologne. We had to sit on the floor of the\ncar, and we were sitting on my grandmother\u2019s cast. We were not allowed to look\nout the window. And he drove us to Cologne and that\u2019s how we left, my parents,\nOctober 17, 2001\nuncle, went to the next town over to pick up another aunt and uncle and my\ngrandmother, who was very ill. And we also came -- they also came to Cologne.\nAnd when the man that drove us came back to the town where we lived, he was\nseverely beaten for having driven us to Cologne. In that way there were many\npeople that were very close to us. My grandfather was a very well-respected man.\nHe did business 1n -- all over. He helped many people, he loaned them money, he\nset them up in business, Jews and non-Jews, and he was very well respected. As a\nmatter of fact, when we went back this past summer, we went to a castle, and I think\nthe lady that lives in the castle now is the granddaughter of the man that ran my\nparent\u2019s business from 1933 to \u201939. He was, of course, a non-Jew. Jews weren\u2019t\nallowed to do business, and turned over all the funds to my family. And this lady\ninvited us for coffee, and she also has these vague memories of things that -- my\ngrandparents never spoke about it, a -- because my family\u2019s grazing lands abutted\nthe castle\u2019s property, and they must have been very, very good friends. Was trying\nto remember, there was something I wanted to say before and I forgot it of course.",
        "Q: What kind of business was your grandfather in?",
        "A: Same business. What -- what -- the business consisted of my uncle and his -- my\nfather and his brother, my uncle; and three cousins that were also brothers, had the\nsame bus -- were in business together where my uncle would go to east Prussia to\nOctober 17, 2001\nbuy cattle, have it transported by train to the Cologne area, put it in this pastureland\nor in the stables, and then sell the | -- cattle to the dealers -- to the farmers in the\narea. S -- and my grandfather had that business and my father and uncles took it\nover. And the three brothers and the two brothers, were always in business together.\n[coughing]. Sorry.",
        "Q: After Kristallnacht, what was next for you and your family?",
        "A: Well, we piled into this apartment and my father, his brother and one of the\ncousins were terrified about being picked up and put into concentration camps. So\nfor three or four nights they would sleep during the day and drive through Cologne\nat night in order not to be picked up. The only thing they did was stop for gas. They\ndid this for -- well, Kristallnacht was on a Thursday, they did it Friday during the\nday, Friday night was Shabbat and they stayed home shab -- and they were hiding,\nbecause the m -- there were very few men around of their age. And they started\ndoing this again Sunday, and I think Monday and Tuesday. And then they tried to\ngo across the border into Holland, illegally. And of course they were caught and\nsent back. And tried -- a day or so later they tried again and they managed to get\nacross the border, but were picked up by Dutch police that were friendly to the\nNazis. And they informed the Nazis and they put them in prison. They were\nimprisoned. And as I said earlier, my uncle and aunt had gone to Holland already.\nOctober 17, 2001\nAnd with the assistance of highly prominent people in Holland, that had\nconnections to the queen, etcetera, they were able to arrange that they were not\nbeing sent -- that they would not be sent back. So -- and they were put into a camp,\nwhich was kind of like restricted. They were not allowed out, but they were not in\nprison. And they were there from November \u201938 to May 1939. We did not see my\nfather in all that time, we had no contact with him. And my mother then handled --\nmy mother and my aunts handled all the emigration things because after\nKristallnacht, they m -- the Jews were told that they had to go and clean up the\nmess. And my mother went back and she looked at it and she said, I'll never do that.\nThe Persian carpets were on the manure heap. The prayer books were full of eggs.\nWe still have some of them -- show you. And it was very, very difficult, but many --\nnot many, but several of the non-Jewish families came to her aid and helped her.\nAnd of course, food was very difficult to obtain at that time, and the people from\nthe land would come with baskets to Cologne to bring us food. As a matter of fact,\nthey knew we would only eat kosher chickens, one woman came every week with a\nlive chicken on the bus, to Cologne. And two of my uncles were Shochten, they\nhad learned that, so that way we had our kosher chickens. You see, we -- we\nweren\u2019t -- we really did not any -- have any deprivations in that way, because\npeople helped us.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: You said your mother handled the emigration work, what kind of work was she\ndoing at this point?",
        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t do it alone, there was her sister, the cu -- and two cousins, and\none of my unc -- two of ma -- of the cousin -- two of the three brothers that were\ncousins were still in Germany, so they all had -- worked on it together. But you\nhave to remember, we had a 17 room house. It was fully furnished, that you could\nfind on the street. Linens, clothing, everything in that house was smashed. There\nwasn\u2019t a single piece that was left together. And at that time my mother went and\nbought a complete ha -- n-new furniture, dishes, pots, pans, housewares, linens. She\nbought everything new. She knew she was not allowed to take out any money when\nshe left Germany. And everything she bought had to be paid to the store, had to be\ndocumented, and the same amount of money had to be paid to the German\ngovernment for export tax. And I would say 75 percent of the stuff that she bought\nwas on a boat to come to Africa when the British bombed it 1n the -- in the port of\nHamburg. And I think if you look at the bottom, you\u2019ll still find it there. So I\nwould say 75 percent of the stuff she bought never -- never got to us.",
        "Q: Why Africa?",
        "A: It\u2019s a long story. America wouldn\u2019t let us in and my -- one of the cousins was\nmarried to a woman who had a cousin who had, | think studied law in England.\nOctober 17, 2001\nAnd he was hired by the Kenya government as an attorney in Kenya. And he -- and\nit was still relatively easy to get into Kenya. And he sent affidavit for 17 people. At\nthe time, I think you had to deposit 50 pounds per person as an entry fee. And after\nthe war started -- we arrived in Kenya on June first, the war started September first.\nAfter the war started that fee was up to 250 pounds. But we were lucky, we got in.\nMy father and uncles went -- got there four weeks earlier. They went from Holland\nto England to Kenya. We went from Germany by train via Switzerland to Italy,\nand then we went to Kenya, on a German ship that served us kosher food. Talk\nabout being ironic.",
        "Q: What were you personally able to take with you when you left?",
        "A: My clothes. That\u2019s about it. Clothing.",
        "Q: No books or toys?",
        "A: No, they were all gone in Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Were you able to say goodbye?",
        "A: Yes. That was one of the saddest days of -- the saddest things that I remember,\nbecause a -- all the aunts and the uncles and any relatives and friends all came to the\nstation in Cologne, the railroad station, to say goodbye. And we didn\u2019t know that\nwe wouldn\u2019t see them again, but it was a very, very sad parting. Very sad. Cousins,\nuncles, aunts. It was really very traumatic. And of course, we never saw any of\nOctober 17, 2001\nthem again, except my uncle and aunt that lived in Holland. They were living in\nHolland and they got permission to come to Kenya, my parents worked on that.\nMy parents arrived in 1939 and they wi -- got onto a boat in Holland the day that\nHitler walked into Holland. They were on a boat and they were able to come to\nAfrica in 1940.",
        "Q: Do you have any other memories of your life in Germany? Now that you\u2019re\nabout to leave Germany, anything else that comes to mind?",
        "A: No. In -- you asked me if I was t -- able to take books or toys, I don\u2019t even\nremember having them. Not because they weren\u2019t available, but I just -- I don\u2019t\nremember playing.",
        "Q: Going to pause and I want to flip the tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Inge Katzenstein. This is tape number one, side\nB, and we have you now leaving Germany.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What were your -- what were your expectations about your new destination?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: As a nine year old, I don\u2019t think I had any. I was happy that we would be\ntogether with my father again, and I think I was happy that we would be free to\nspeak and run around again. But other -- other than that, I personally had no\nexpectations.",
        "Q: Did you have any regrets about leaving Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Oh no, none. None whatsoever.",
        "Q: What were your first impressions of your new home?",
        "A: Lovely. Strange, of course, with all the flowers and greenery all year round.\nDifferent people. Africans and their living quarters and habits. Having to speak\nEnglish, which we didn\u2019t know a word about. Not being able to understand a single\nword. But that was very quickly rectified. I think after being there two days, we\nwere in English schools. And that was very traumatic. New country, new school, no\nlanguage. I was in fourth or fifth grade and I had to start again in first grade. And --\nbut it wen -- and that was very upsetting to me to be put back with the small\nchildren. But we learned English very rapidly. It wasn\u2019t English as a second\nlanguage. We were pushed into it, we learned. And every two weeks I was put up\nuntil I was with my grade level. And I remember that the first, second day, having\nto come home to learn a poem by heart. And not only couldn\u2019t -- I could -- didn\u2019t I\nunderstate it, couldn\u2019t read it. And my 70 year old grandmother said, come child, I\nOctober 17, 2001\nwill learn it with you. She couldn\u2019t read it. But between the two of us, we learned it\nby heart and by the time I got to school, I knew it by heart, but I couldn\u2019t -- I\ncouldn\u2019t say it because I couldn\u2019t -- I didn't know how to pronounce it. I could read\nit. I knew it by heart, but I could -- couldn\u2019t pronounce it. But that -- those things\nwere very quickly rectified and we were very happy in school. The children all\nwore uniforms so it was all -- we were all the same. And it worked out very well.",
        "Q: What was your family\u2019s legal status?",
        "A: We were enemy aliens. It was really ironic. We had left Germany -- I have to\nthink a minute. We had left Germany as stateless. Jews were no longer considered\nGermans, so we were stateless. And we arrived in Kenya, which at that time was a\nBritish colony, and I don\u2019t know under what quota, under what auspices, but the\nday war broke out, we were considered enemy aliens. And it was rather strange, but\nthat\u2019s what we were and we were enemy alien -- we were stateless until we came to\nAmerica in 1947, when we came under the German quota. Again we were put -- at\nthat point considered Germans.",
        "Q: What did it mean for you, for your family, to be enemy aliens?",
        "A: They laughed about it because it was so iro -- ironic. The -- the thing that it real -\n- that it meant physically was, my parents bought a very, very large farm in -- a\nranch in Kenya. And what it came down to was we were interned on the property.\nOctober 17, 2001\nWe were not allowed to leave the property without permission. Any time we wanted\nto go to town -- every week we had to go to Nairobi, which was 20 miles away. We\nlived in the highlands in Limuru, we had to go buy groceries. We had to go to the\npolice department and get permission to go to Nairobi and buy groceries. And --\nbut otherwise it was not a problem. But in the beginning, when we -- when war\nbroke out, everybody was very upset and we were then declared enemy aliens and\nthe British came with the A-African soldiers to arrest my -- all the men that had\nnow come to freedom in Kenya, were arrested, including my 80 year old\ngrandfather. And they were taken to a place of internment for security. And my\ngrandmother at that point said to the British whoever he was, police officer, she\nsaid, now I want you to know something. We fled Germany to safety, to come\nhere. I have been married to this man for 45 years and where he goes, I go. So if\nyou\u2019re going to take my 80 year old husband, I\u2019m going to go with him, he\u2019s not\ngoing to be alone. He looked at my grandmother, he says, okay, we\u2019ll leave him\nhere. And the men were there one or two nights and they came back. They realized\nwhat was going on and looked into their background and they were released. We\nwere, at that time, still living 1n a ho -- in a house that my father had rented in\nNairobi, and that was before we had purchased the ranch. Afterwards, they made it\nOctober 17, 2001\nmandatory that the men help the war effort, and manage the ranches of the British\nthat had gone to war. My uncle became a manager of a farm.",
        "Q: For you as a young person, what kind of social life did you have in your new\nhome?",
        "A: None. None whatsoever. First we lived on the farm, and my parents realized we\nneeded to be educated, so they hired tutors for us. The tutors lived in, but we were\nmuch too rambunctious to stay with tutors. We did not -- it did not work out. And\nanother thing that happened was in Africa we grew pyrethrum, which -- of which\nDDT is made. And that was a big business at that time because it was sold -- 1t was\nneeded for the war effort, because America used to get its DDT from Japan, and\nthey couldn\u2019t get it any more. And my mother was terribly, terribly allergic to it.\nHer face would break out and her skin would break. It was just awful. So she could\nnot live on the farm, and the tutor business didn\u2019t work out. So my mother and my\nsister and I moved to Nairobi to town so we -- we could go to school. The first\nsemester or SO we moved to another place in Limuru, and we had to walk down a\nhill, cross the little river and up a hill to go to school. But we didn\u2019t stay there too\nlong. And my father, uncle and grandparents -- on the ranch that we bought there\nwere two large homes. The three brothers and families lived in one and my father\nand uncle and grandparents, and we lived in the other. That had been the quarter --\nOctober 17, 2001\nthe -- the laborers quarters before we bought the farm, and it was very, very dirty\nand it had no inside plumbing. And well, cleaned it up, and we moved in. And -- but\nafter awhile my mother couldn\u2019t live there, and we moved away. My father would\ncome to us on weekends. And we went to school. First we went to Limuru girls\u2019\nschool as day students, which was one of the most exclusive boarding schools there\nwas. Don\u2019t forget, we were in a British colony, and they all had boarding schools.\nThen we went to Nairobi and we went to school there. We went to the Nairobi\ngirls\u2019 high school. Again, very exclusive school. [coughs] Excuse me. And we\nstayed there until we gra -- graduated from high school. And my father stayed on\nthe farm and worked the farms and came to see us on weekends. In addition to that,\nmoney was not plentiful, so we had rented a home in Nairobi and my mother rented\nout rooms to augment her income. And that\u2019s what we did for many, many years.",
        "Q: Did you have to get special permission to -- to -- to move there and have your\nfather come visit?",
        "A: This was after the war.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Wait a minute. That\u2019s not true. No, this was during the war. I\u2019m sure they did.\nI\u2019m sure they did, but I don\u2019t think 1t became a -- any trouble.",
        "Q: Did anybody there ask you about your life in Germany\u201d\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Yes, many in the Jewish community. There was a nice Jewish community in\nNairobi and people that had been there 20 - 30 years, and yes they did ask us. But\nwe were absorbed into the community, it was really -- living in Nairobi was very,\nvery pleasant.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism there?",
        "A: No, not to my knowledge or memory.",
        "Q: Did you expect to stay there indefinitely?",
        "A: Not really. I don\u2019t think my parents had that intention because there was\nbasically no Yiddishkeit. There were no -- there were no -- I don\u2019t think there were\nany other Orthodox Jews, except one or two families that had also come as\nimmigrants. And again, it was very difficult to keep any of the observance. So after\nthe war my father was anxious to leave, so that we -- that the children could at least\nbe integrated into an Orthodox community.",
        "Q: So the Jewish community that was there -- you said it was a -- it was a lovely\nJewish community, where were those people from and what kinds of traditions did\nthey follow?",
        "A: Their traditions today would be con -- considered Conservative Judaism. Where\nwere they from? From Poland, from England, from all over the world. From\nSomalia, from all over the world. Some were refugees like we were, others were\nOctober 17, 2001\nolder residents that -- I don\u2019t know where they came from, but they had been there\nfor years and years; they were well established. But most of them had Polish\nbackgrounds, so I as -- assumption at this stage loo -- in retrospect is, maybe their\nparents left under the pogroms and settled wherever they could. That\u2019s retrospect.",
        "Q: How carefully did you follow what was going on in Germany and in Europe?",
        "A: My parents and uncle did as much as they could. While we were on the farm, we\nhad no electricity, but we did have a radio that was battery run. It was only allowed\nto be used for the news, and my uncle and parents followed that very, very closely.\nThey were very concerned about the people they had left behind. We did get some\nmail from them through the Red Cross. They did receive some packages that we\nhad sent, but then after awhile all correspondence stopped, and they were very, very\nconcerned, but there was nothing we could do.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?",
        "A: We had an inkling that things were very, very bad, but really exactly what was\ngoing on, no. At least -- as teenagers, we were off in another world. But my parents\nand uncles had ideas, but really didn\u2019t know what was going on.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we pause until these sirens pass. [tape break] Okay, I think they\u2019ve -\n- | think they\u2019ve passed.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: My parents had ideas, possibly were able to read through the lines what was\ngoing on, but actually no, we did not know until after the war, what was going on.",
        "Q: So when did you find out?",
        "A: What I remember -- I think I was either 16 or 17 -- the war was over in \u00b045, so I\nwas 16, and at that time -- and came here when I was 17, so when we left Kenya,\nsomeone gave my father a book of pictures of the camps. It was a very new book\nand it was horrendous. It was a horrendous book, he wouldn\u2019t let us look at it. And I\nremember he stood on the end of the ship, he threw it overboard. He could not see\nit, he could not live with those pictures.",
        "Q: Before I have you leaving Africa, are there any other memories that you have\nthat stand out, or any other experiences that you\u2019d like to share?",
        "A: Well, we became much happier, we went to the movies. We met other young\npeople of our age. It was a -- 1t was a happier time, but cannot be compared to\nAmerican teenagers life. And I had just graduated high school, my sister was still in\nschool, and that\u2019s about the time we left.",
        "Q: And why did you leave at -- at that moment, that time?",
        "A: We got -- at that time we had received our visas and it was time to go. Trip was\nvery long, it was seven weeks on a cargo boat, and was a long trip. We stopped --\nwe stopped in every port from Mombassa, which was Kenya, down to Cape\nOctober 17, 2001\nTown. It was a cargo boat that took on -- was a very interesting trip for us. We went\nashore. Actually, I\u2019ve been into every port from Cairo to Cape Town. Coming --\ncoming from Germany we stopped in -- up there, and went through the Daman\nIsle, and round -- around Aden, we stopped in Aden and then came down, stopped\nin Somalia at that time, and then down to Kenya. And then seven years later we\ncontinued from Kenya to all the small ports. Port Elizabeth, Durbin, and then\nCape Town, and then -- that took four weeks. The trip fr-from -- that -- because\nthey stopped so much. And then it was three weeks up the Atlantic without a stop,\nto Boston. And at the end of that trip there was such a horrendous storm, that we\nwere walking on the walls of the boat. Wasn\u2019t a dish left in the kitchen that was\nwhole. The storm was so bad outside of Boston, that a-although our tickets were for\nNew York, they wouldn\u2019t take us to New York, they said you have to leave in\nBoston, and we took a train to New York. And for -- for my sister and myself it\nwas a wonderful trip. We did everything on that boat. From keeping the logs, from\nsteering the ship, from swabbing the decks. We did everything. We had a wonderful\ntime. And no food. No kosher food. And we had taken some food along, and the\nfunniest thing 1s, after the first day or two my mother refused to eat the bread. Why?\nThe baker of the boat had a monkey that he dipped in the water every day and then\nOctober 17, 2001\nrolled him on the deck like bread. It was a toy -- 1-it was a pet. When my mother\nsaw that, she got so disgusted she wouldn\u2019t eat the bread.",
        "Q: When did you arrive in the States?",
        "A: In February, 1948. Snow over the houses. No winter coats. Having lived in the\ntropics for seven years. Oh, it was cold. Very cold.",
        "Q: Did you have any expectations about the United States?",
        "A: Not really. Not really, because you know, we just took it day by day. Whatever\nwe had to do, we did. I started school.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: Queen\u2019s Plaza, went to stenography school to become a secretary, and after a\nfew weeks I decided I knew enough and I wanted a job and the only job I wanted\nwas on Fifth Avenue. And I took the \u201cNew York Times\u201d and went from -- and\nanything that was Fifth Avenue, I went in and applied for a job. I started way\ndowntown and walked my way up. I think the first one I got was at 23\" Street, but I\nwas so inexperienced, I didn\u2019t last longer than a week there. So, took the \u201cNew\nYork Times\u201d again and started from 23\" Street up to 43\" Street. And finally found\n-- was hired in an attorney\u2019s office, where there were two attorneys and an\naccountant. I knew nothing. Finally, one of the men that hired me -- they must have\nfelt sorry for me, said, do us a favor, go back to school, and learn. And I did. I went\nOctober 17, 2001\nto night school in Queens, worked in Manhattan and lived in Brooklyn. I could\nhave switched schools, but I didn\u2019t. I was too -- too scared. I could have gone to\ncollege, because with the British education that we had, it was qui -- equivalent to\nthe junior year in college. Didn\u2019t do it. [had to work. We -- and I had that job for a\nlong time and I told them I observe the Sabbath, and the one attorney said -- would\ncome to me every aftern -- Friday afternoon, an hour before sunset and say, it\u2019s time\nfor you to go home. Which I thou -- you know, it enabled me to be home before\nsunset. I -- finally I did learn shorthand and stenography and I was able to type. And\nI used to do spreadsheets for the accountant, who was terribly fussy. He would hold\nmy work up to the light and say, you erased, do it over. I learned to erase, he\ncouldn\u2019t tell any more. I worked there -- how long did I work there? A year, year\nand a half? Not -- yeah, til 1950, two years m -- year and a half, maybe. And by\nthen my parents had bought a chicken farm in Vineland, New Jersey. And I was\nliving with an aunt and uncle in Brooklyn. And we belonged to an -- or -- or to a\ncongregation there, and I made friends there and met a lot of young people. And\ndidn\u2019t want to come -- move to Vineland. And I somehow managed financially. I\nwas on my own. When my parents left for New Jersey, my father -- I was renting a\nroom somewhere on the West Side, 96\u2122 Street, and my aunt and uncle had moved\nto Brooklyn. And my father left me with a hundred dollars and he said, when that\u2019s\nOctober 17, 2001\nfinished, it\u2019s yours. And from that day on, I was independent. I got a job, I paid my\nroom and board. Subway was a nickel one way, so all you need 1s a dollar a week\nfor subway, and I was on my own until 1950, when I -- ?50? Yeah, end of 1950. I\nhad met my husband in the fall of 1950 and moved -- and then moved to Vineland\nand became engaged in January of \u201951. And then I st-started to work in Vineland\nfor an attorney who came to my parents\u2019 house and said, I hear you\u2019re a legal\nsecretary, can you come to work for me? And I did. And I worked for him til my\nfirst child was born.",
        "Q: Before I let you go any further, I have a few questions that I wanted to go back\nto. When you came to this country, did anybody help you? Any of the Jewish\nagencies or anything like that?",
        "A: To my knowledge, we went to HIAS to fill out citizen papers, period. We had an\nuncle that lived here and a cousin who owned a restaurant on 49\" Street, his name\nwas John Schwartz. He owned Headquarters restaurant. He was Eisenhower\u2019s\nmess sergeant in World War II. He did the Berlin conference for Eisenhower and\nhe was with Eisenhower through the entire campaign. And when he came back, he\nopened a restaurant in -- on 49\" Street in New York City. So we had a lot of help\nfrom -- from the cousins.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: When you came here, did anybody ask you about your experiences in\nGermany?",
        "A: No. No. People didn\u2019t want to talk at that time, they didn\u2019t want to know.",
        "Q: And how did you meet your husband?",
        "A: It was a blind date in Brooklyn. He lived in -- on the farm in New Jersey, and\nhe would come ou -- he had vacation, and somebody gave me father-in-law my\ntelephone number and he gave it to Werner and he called me and we went out and\nwe enjoyed it, and he -- he was only in New York for a week, and he had just come\nout of the service. And he asked me for lunch the next day. Must have liked me,\nright? I went to lunch with him because to me it was a free lunch. I didn\u2019t -- and\nfrom then on he kept writing, he kept coming to New York. And by the -- by the\nend of the year, the aunt and uncle that I lived with had also moved to Vineland, so\nI went to Vineland. And that\u2019s when we be -- got engaged.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to pause now to change tape. [inaudible]",
        "A: Am I talking too much?\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nOctober 17, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Inge Katzenstein. This is tape number two, side\nA. And you were talking about your husband courting you, but while I was flipping\nthe tape you remembered something that you wanted to add, with respect to your\nexperience in Africa.",
        "A: I just wanted to say that in general we were very fortunate to be alive, because\nwe left Germany before World War II, in June of \u201939, and we were able to leave\nKenya right before the Mau Mau uprising, be -- because had we stayed in Kenya\nwe would have been right in the center of Mau Mau territory, and we -- the ranch\nthat my parents had bought was not sold at the time, it took several years to be able\nto sell it, and for us to be able to transfer the funds from Kenya to here.",
        "Q: While you\u2019re talking about the -- the ranch and the funds, how was your family\nable to afford to buy a ranch in Kenya?",
        "A: Again, my family was very fortunate. On May 1, 1933, one of my uncles took\nlarge sums of money to Holland and banked them in Holland, because after that it\nwas more difficult to get money out. And that\u2019s how we had funds in Holland,\nwhich were then transferred to Africa.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: As we finished the last tape, you were telling me about your husband courting\nyou, and can you tell me a little bit about his background? Is -- was he born and\nraised in the United States?",
        "A: No, he was born in Germany, and he -- he and his family [coughs] also left\nGermany in 1937 and lived in Holland until 1939, and were then able to come to\nAmerica. He will tell 1t in his story. And they purchased a farm outside of\nCamden, New Jersey, and he will elaborate on that. And in 19 -- w-war broke out\nin 1942 for America, right? \u201941 - \u00b042. He was inducted into the army in 1944,\nagain, as an enemy alien and became a citizen in the army and then was sent back\noverseas to Germany, first as an infantry soldier. He was wounded, and after the\nwar ended he went into mini -- military government as an interpreter. And I think he\nwas discharged 40 -- in 1946, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Just tell me his full name.",
        "A: Werner Katzenstein.",
        "Q: When did the two of you decide to get married?",
        "A: We became engaged in February of 1951.",
        "Q: And when did you get married?",
        "A: September 11\", 1951.",
        "Q: And you have children?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Yes, we have three children. Our son Michael is a hospital administrator and\nlives in Beverly, Massachusetts, which is the outskirts of Boston. Our second son,\nDavid is an attorney and lives in Highland Park, New Jersey. His offices are in\nPrinceton, New Jersey, and he\u2019s the proud father of five children. Michael has two\nchildren. Our daughter, Debbie is a venture capitalist banker in Pittsburgh,\nworking for PNC, and she has two children. So we have nine grandchildren of\nwhich we are very proud.",
        "Q: While you were raising them, did you also work outside the home?",
        "A: Oh yes. I worked as a legal secretary until David was born. My mother helped\nme take care of Michael. After that, I didn\u2019t work for about 10 years and had\nanother child, third child, Debbie. And when she was four years old I started to\nwork to sell real estate. And for 32 years I sold real estate for, first\n[indecipherable] O\u2019 Reilly in Vineland, New Jersey which then later became\nColdwell Banker.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about some of the historical events that, you know, in the\ncourse of your late teens an-and -- and adulthood. After the war, did you follow the\nNuremberg trials?",
        "A: Not really, no.",
        "Q: Did you follow the partition debates in the U.N. regarding Palestine?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Vaguely, but not -- not -- not to an extent that I should have.",
        "Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trial?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think I did.",
        "Q: What was your reaction, if you can remember, your reaction to the way it was\npresented to the people in the United States?",
        "A: I can\u2019t comment on that because I don\u2019t remember enough.",
        "Q: Did you feel that justice was done?",
        "A: Yes, definitely.",
        "Q: You were in the United States during some of -- some very dramatic changes\nhere. What were your thoughts about the Civil Rights movement?",
        "A: I think everybody should have civil rights and have the freedom to do and work\nin a manner that America was envisioned. And this should be freedom for\neveryone, regardless of color, creed or nationality. But it has to be a safe freedom. It\nhas to be the people that -- just as a comparison that -- what I can say now is that\npre-World War II and during World War II, America would not let any immigrants\nin -- or Jewish immigrants into the country. And looking at it today, which is ninet -\n- oh, 2001, after the terrorist attacks, God knows who\u2019s running through America,\nand nobody checked. But a few harmless Jews were not allowed in, and I don\u2019t\nknow what to say any more.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: When did you move to Washington?",
        "A: 19 -- January 1998.",
        "Q: Why? Why did you come here?",
        "A: My sister has lived in this area for 25 years. We were ready to retire. In addition\nto that, our mother was in a nursing home in Atlantic City, about which we were\nnot too happy, and we were able to have her transferred to the Hebrew Home of\nGreater Washington. And it was quite a long trip to visit her. The trip from\nVineland to Washington is about three hours. And we were retired, there was no\nreason for us to live in Vineland. Was more and more difficult to be observant Jews\nin Vineland, because the observant synagogues were closing. And this is what my\nhusband and I wanted in our life, to have community that observes and be together\nwith my sister and be able to see my mother, who died a year ago.",
        "Q: When did you start working at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019?",
        "A: I think it was April of \u201998. My brother-in-law and sister have volunteered at the\nmuseum from before it opened, and they thought that would be a good place for us\nto spend some time. So we went down and we do translations now.",
        "Q: What special insights do you bring to your work?",
        "A: Insights. We were -- we feel very good about being able to translate the letters,\nwhich are heart-wrenching at times. They are the gifts to the museum of mostly\nOctober 17, 2001\ngrandchildren of people that have perished because they were not able to get out.\nAnd these -- and this correspondence is the grandparents writing to the parents. And\nthe parents saved these letters, and the grandchildren can\u2019t read them any more.\nSome of them are in German script that both my husband and I can still read. Some\nof them are very difficult to decipher and terribly heart-wrenching to read.",
        "Q: Have you had any unusual or dramatic experiences at the museum?",
        "A: No, not really, because we work behind the scenes. We don\u2019t see the public. We\ngo into the Ross building, have our little cubicle and spend our day there and go\nhome.",
        "Q: Do you ever speak publicly about your experiences?",
        "A: I used to speak to schoolchildren in -- in New Jersey, and I have done it once\nhere because one of the teachers asked me to come to a class. Now, I\u2019ve not done\nno s -- | have not done any s -- public speaking.",
        "Q: Have you ever return -- well, you mentioned you returned to Germany since the\nwar.",
        "A: Yeah. The first time we returned to Germany was at my sister\u2019s urging because\nthe city of Cologne invited us as their guests for a week. I did not want to go but my\nsister said, come on, let\u2019s go. And we did. It was a good week, it was a structured\nweek. It was planned by the city. We were treated royally. But I kept looking over\nOctober 17, 2001\nmy shoulder to see who was following me. If I saw a German Shepherd, I ran. I was\nnot a happy camper. This time we were in Europe for three weeks and we just\nspent four days in Germany because our son wanted to see, quote unquote, his\nroots. And he was able to fly over for four days, rent a car and we went to the town\nthat my father was born in. We went to the town that my mother was born in, and\nwe went to the town where our great-grandmother was buried. And after that we\nreally had enough of the autobahn and we went on to Holland and he went home.",
        "Q: On your second trip, the one that was not structured, ho-how did you -- how\nwere you treated by the people that you met?",
        "A: The only people that we really met in Germany were hotel personnel, and we\nhadn\u2019t -- th -- and then of course we were treated ex -- like royalty by the people\nthat had the castle. We were also treated extremely well by the daughter of my\naunt\u2019s maid, who treated us like royalty. Very sweet, very nice and -- extremely\nnice, but these people were nice to us before. We didn\u2019t meet any new ones. I had a\n-- | had an experience on the first trip which really shocked me. We were at a dinner\nplanned by the city, with teachers, because at that time we had gone over and we\nspoke to classes in Germany. And one of the teachers sitting next to me, she says, I\nhave to admit to you, my mother is a Nazi to this day. I was speechless. So anybody\nI saw that was my age or older, I considered to be a Nazi.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: I have to ask you about a Torah scroll. You have not mentioned it, but I would\nlike you to tell me about it.",
        "A: Oh, okay. The two cousins that stayed behind to the very end were able to\npurchase a -- that -- a Torah scroll that was saved from one of the synagogues and\nthey brought it to Kenya. In Kenya we used it because we had services on the\nholidays. The family had five adult males and during the war my mother ha-had\nmany, many Jewish soldiers, from England, from Africa, from -- from South\nAfrica, from America, that would come for rest and recuperation to our farm. And\nso for the holidays they always kept -- if they were still in Kenya, we\u2019d always\ncome back. And the Torah scroll was used in Kenya all the time. When we came to\nAmerica, a Torah scroll was used in a small country synagogue outside of\nVineland, called Brockmanville. And when we left the area, we took the Torah\nscroll with us again. It is not kosher any more, it cannot be used as as -- Torah\nscroll. So not knowing what to do with it, not wanting to bury it, we donated it as a\ngift to KMS synagogue in Silver Spring, who gratefully accepted it and built a\nbeautiful orann for it, and it s-stands in their bet-hamek in the small synagogue,\nand it is taken out once a year on Simchas Torah, when everybody dances with it.\nAnd I feel that 1s a beautiful place for it because it\u2019s still being used for what it was\nintended for.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: Is there anything that we have not covered that you would like to add before we\nconclude today?",
        "A: Yes. I have to say I don\u2019t -- did I say it before about not being survivors?",
        "Q: Say whatever you'd like, it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I may have mentioned this before, that we wi -- feel very fortunate to be alive\nand to be able to live in freedom in America, to raise our children to be Orthodox\nJews, and to be able to spend our later years of -- being to some advantage to the\nmuseum of being able to do the translations, even though they are very, very\ndifficult at times to do. And some Mondays we come home quite depressed. But\nthen life goes on and things get better.",
        "Q: Well, I'd like to thank you very much for speaking with me today and this\nconcludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Inge\nKatzenstein. Thank you.",

So after all these years, the cement platform\nof our Sukkot -- sukkah, was still there. And as a matter of fact, we went back this\npast summer to show it to my oldest son, and there it still was.",

        "A: No.",
        "A: Basically they start with when I had to go to school. In the town that we lived in\nthere was no Jewish day school. And I started school in 1935, and for the first year,\nthe first six months I would say, I went to the public school. And then the edict\ncame down that Jewish children were not allowed to go to school any more, and I\nhad to go to school in the town where my grandmother lived, and I had to go and\nlive with my grandmother. Couldn\u2019t live at home any more. In order to go to school,\nI moved there and went to school there.",

And then my -- my aunt and uncle also lived with my grandmother and they\nOctober 17, 2001\nemigrated to Holland. And my grandmother went to live with another daughter and\nI had to go home and I then went to school in Cologne, which was a half hour, 45\nminute train ride or bus ride from where we lived. So I commuted every day as a\neight, nine year old, by train or bus to Cologne to school, on my own.",

        "A: I really didn\u2019t know, but I was always playing around with the thought of being a\npediatrician, but it never went any further than that. But I do have to backtrack and\ntell you that I was a feisty little girl, and coming off the bus one day there was this\nsnotty little kid that called me dirty Jew. And I went after him and beat him to pulp.\nAnd after I had done that I got scared and I ran. And between the bus stop and\nwhere we lived, one of my father\u2019s cousins lived. So I ran to his house to hide. But\nhe got his dues for calling me dirty Jew. He never called me dirty Jew again. And I\nmust have been eight or nine years old.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Yes, very vividly after Kristallnacht in 1938, we had to leave our home and we\nmoved into an apartment in the city of Cologne where three uncles and an aunt,\nbrothers and sisters, all of whom were unmarried, lived. And it was like a two or\nthree bedroom apartment and I don\u2019t know how -- remember how many people\npiled in there. But now I was supposed to walk to school. And I think most days I\ndid, but the teachers thought my Hebrew education was sadly lack-lacking, and\nsuggested that I have some extra lessons. And my mother arranged for me to have\nthem after school. Inevitably the teacher would call and ask where I was. And my\nmother said, well isn\u2019t she there? And no, she\u2019s not here. I was roaming the city of\nCologne and there were all these stores that had the signs in the window, Juden\n[indecipherable], meaning Jews not wanted. And that\u2019s the line I would stand on,\nand they were selling coffee with an eighth of a pound. And my grandmother, my\nmother\u2019s mother, was very ill. She had cancer, and her only joy was a cup of coffee.\nSo many afternoons I would come -- I would have stood on five, six lines and I\nwould have come home with a pound of coffee. That\u2019s where I was, standing on\nline somewhere or taking the streetcar and going to a bakery and pick up a piece of\ncake for my grandmother. But I never told anybody where I was going. I was just\nroaming the city and I -- I always got back home.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: N-No. There was a lot of discussion at home between the adults, but they tried to\nshield the children from it, so really, no.",
        "A: By not talking about any of their problems in front of us. It was always hush\nhush. And that\u2019s why I have so few memories.",
        "A: Yes, we always lived in fear. We didn\u2019t have a normal life. We didn\u2019t go on\nvacations, we didn\u2019t go on picnics, we didn\u2019t go to the movies. It was not a normal\nlife as you would know it here.",
        "A: Yes, my father very much wanted to leave Germany and he did have a visa\napplication number y -- that everybody had to have, a quota number. But the quota\nnumbers were very, very high for Germans at that time, and there was very little\nhope for us. We were working on it, but it didn't go as fast as you think it would.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Sorry. No, no, not at all. No. I was a little girl. No. We li -- we were sheltered.\nMy parents sheltered us. My sister\u2019s memories are so different. She remembers that\nshe was never allowed out. She was younger and they kept her hidden, they kept her\nindoors. I just went out on my own.",
        "A: Very vague, small things that I really can\u2019t put together to make any sense.",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely. I -- my parents, living outside Cologne, and I don\u2019t think\nradios were very much in use at that time, sent me to school that day. And I went to\nschool the way I usually did and when I got to the school, the -- the Gestapo or\npolice, I don\u2019t remember, I ca -- I still can\u2019t tell the difference between one and the\nother, were standing in front of the school with German Shepherds. And they told\nus, children there is no school today, go home. And the school was right next door\nto a beautiful synagogue, and we could see that the roof of the synagogue was burnt\nout. And we went home -- we got on the train, went home, and when I got home my\nOctober 17, 2001\nmother said, well, what are you doing here? And I said, well, th-they sent us home.\nThey said there was no school today. It must have been 11 - 12 o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. That time my uncle had a very good school friend who came to the house\nand said to my family, whatever you see or hear today, do not leave your home. Just\ndon\u2019t leave the house. In other words, he must have known what was going to\nhappen and he told my uncle not to leave. So, around three, four o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon we hear that the synagogue is burning, the fire engines ran. We saw the\nsmoke from the home. My cr -- grandfather had been president of the synagogue for\nover 20 years and th -- his natural thing was to run to the synagogue to save the\nbooks, to save the Torahs. But my father and uncle would not let him leave. And we\nsaw all this and we decided -- my grandmother at that time had a broken ankle, so\nher leg was 1n a cast. So my parents decided it was time to get out. Every other\nJewish male in the little town that we lived in, ran to the synagogue. They were all\npicked up and put in concentration camp. My parents and my uncle and three\ncousins who lived in the next town over, all decided to go to Cologne. These are all\nthe people that filed into this apartment. And a non-Jewish man drove us, my\ngrandparents, my sister and I, drove us to Cologne. We had to sit on the floor of the\ncar, and we were sitting on my grandmother\u2019s cast. We were not allowed to look\nout the window. And he drove us to Cologne and that\u2019s how we left, my parents,\nOctober 17, 2001\nuncle, went to the next town over to pick up another aunt and uncle and my\ngrandmother, who was very ill. And we also came -- they also came to Cologne.\nAnd when the man that drove us came back to the town where we lived, he was\nseverely beaten for having driven us to Cologne. In that way there were many\npeople that were very close to us. My grandfather was a very well-respected man.\nHe did business 1n -- all over. He helped many people, he loaned them money, he\nset them up in business, Jews and non-Jews, and he was very well respected. As a\nmatter of fact, when we went back this past summer, we went to a castle, and I think\nthe lady that lives in the castle now is the granddaughter of the man that ran my\nparent\u2019s business from 1933 to \u201939. He was, of course, a non-Jew. Jews weren\u2019t\nallowed to do business, and turned over all the funds to my family. And this lady\ninvited us for coffee, and she also has these vague memories of things that -- my\ngrandparents never spoke about it, a -- because my family\u2019s grazing lands abutted\nthe castle\u2019s property, and they must have been very, very good friends. Was trying\nto remember, there was something I wanted to say before and I forgot it of course.",
        "A: Same business. What -- what -- the business consisted of my uncle and his -- my\nfather and his brother, my uncle; and three cousins that were also brothers, had the\nsame bus -- were in business together where my uncle would go to east Prussia to\nOctober 17, 2001\nbuy cattle, have it transported by train to the Cologne area, put it in this pastureland\nor in the stables, and then sell the | -- cattle to the dealers -- to the farmers in the\narea. S -- and my grandfather had that business and my father and uncles took it\nover. And the three brothers and the two brothers, were always in business together.\n[coughing]. Sorry.",
        "A: Well, we piled into this apartment and my father, his brother and one of the\ncousins were terrified about being picked up and put into concentration camps. So\nfor three or four nights they would sleep during the day and drive through Cologne\nat night in order not to be picked up. The only thing they did was stop for gas. They\ndid this for -- well, Kristallnacht was on a Thursday, they did it Friday during the\nday, Friday night was Shabbat and they stayed home shab -- and they were hiding,\nbecause the m -- there were very few men around of their age. And they started\ndoing this again Sunday, and I think Monday and Tuesday. And then they tried to\ngo across the border into Holland, illegally. And of course they were caught and\nsent back. And tried -- a day or so later they tried again and they managed to get\nacross the border, but were picked up by Dutch police that were friendly to the\nNazis. And they informed the Nazis and they put them in prison. They were\nimprisoned. And as I said earlier, my uncle and aunt had gone to Holland already.\nOctober 17, 2001\nAnd with the assistance of highly prominent people in Holland, that had\nconnections to the queen, etcetera, they were able to arrange that they were not\nbeing sent -- that they would not be sent back. So -- and they were put into a camp,\nwhich was kind of like restricted. They were not allowed out, but they were not in\nprison. And they were there from November \u201938 to May 1939. We did not see my\nfather in all that time, we had no contact with him. And my mother then handled --\nmy mother and my aunts handled all the emigration things because after\nKristallnacht, they m -- the Jews were told that they had to go and clean up the\nmess. And my mother went back and she looked at it and she said, I'll never do that.\nThe Persian carpets were on the manure heap. The prayer books were full of eggs.\nWe still have some of them -- show you. And it was very, very difficult, but many --\nnot many, but several of the non-Jewish families came to her aid and helped her.\nAnd of course, food was very difficult to obtain at that time, and the people from\nthe land would come with baskets to Cologne to bring us food. As a matter of fact,\nthey knew we would only eat kosher chickens, one woman came every week with a\nlive chicken on the bus, to Cologne. And two of my uncles were Shochten, they\nhad learned that, so that way we had our kosher chickens. You see, we -- we\nweren\u2019t -- we really did not any -- have any deprivations in that way, because\npeople helped us.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t do it alone, there was her sister, the cu -- and two cousins, and\none of my unc -- two of ma -- of the cousin -- two of the three brothers that were\ncousins were still in Germany, so they all had -- worked on it together. But you\nhave to remember, we had a 17 room house. It was fully furnished, that you could\nfind on the street. Linens, clothing, everything in that house was smashed. There\nwasn\u2019t a single piece that was left together. And at that time my mother went and\nbought a complete ha -- n-new furniture, dishes, pots, pans, housewares, linens. She\nbought everything new. She knew she was not allowed to take out any money when\nshe left Germany. And everything she bought had to be paid to the store, had to be\ndocumented, and the same amount of money had to be paid to the German\ngovernment for export tax. And I would say 75 percent of the stuff that she bought\nwas on a boat to come to Africa when the British bombed it 1n the -- in the port of\nHamburg. And I think if you look at the bottom, you\u2019ll still find it there. So I\nwould say 75 percent of the stuff she bought never -- never got to us.",
        "A: It\u2019s a long story. America wouldn\u2019t let us in and my -- one of the cousins was\nmarried to a woman who had a cousin who had, | think studied law in England.\nOctober 17, 2001\nAnd he was hired by the Kenya government as an attorney in Kenya. And he -- and\nit was still relatively easy to get into Kenya. And he sent affidavit for 17 people. At\nthe time, I think you had to deposit 50 pounds per person as an entry fee. And after\nthe war started -- we arrived in Kenya on June first, the war started September first.\nAfter the war started that fee was up to 250 pounds. But we were lucky, we got in.\nMy father and uncles went -- got there four weeks earlier. They went from Holland\nto England to Kenya. We went from Germany by train via Switzerland to Italy,\nand then we went to Kenya, on a German ship that served us kosher food. Talk\nabout being ironic.",
        "A: My clothes. That\u2019s about it. Clothing.",
        "A: No, they were all gone in Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Yes. That was one of the saddest days of -- the saddest things that I remember,\nbecause a -- all the aunts and the uncles and any relatives and friends all came to the\nstation in Cologne, the railroad station, to say goodbye. And we didn\u2019t know that\nwe wouldn\u2019t see them again, but it was a very, very sad parting. Very sad. Cousins,\nuncles, aunts. It was really very traumatic. And of course, we never saw any of\nOctober 17, 2001\nthem again, except my uncle and aunt that lived in Holland. They were living in\nHolland and they got permission to come to Kenya, my parents worked on that.\nMy parents arrived in 1939 and they wi -- got onto a boat in Holland the day that\nHitler walked into Holland. They were on a boat and they were able to come to\nAfrica in 1940.",
        "A: No. In -- you asked me if I was t -- able to take books or toys, I don\u2019t even\nremember having them. Not because they weren\u2019t available, but I just -- I don\u2019t\nremember playing.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: As a nine year old, I don\u2019t think I had any. I was happy that we would be\ntogether with my father again, and I think I was happy that we would be free to\nspeak and run around again. But other -- other than that, I personally had no\nexpectations.",
        "A: Oh no, none. None whatsoever.",
        "A: Lovely. Strange, of course, with all the flowers and greenery all year round.\nDifferent people. Africans and their living quarters and habits. Having to speak\nEnglish, which we didn\u2019t know a word about. Not being able to understand a single\nword. But that was very quickly rectified. I think after being there two days, we\nwere in English schools. And that was very traumatic. New country, new school, no\nlanguage. I was in fourth or fifth grade and I had to start again in first grade. And --\nbut it wen -- and that was very upsetting to me to be put back with the small\nchildren. But we learned English very rapidly. It wasn\u2019t English as a second\nlanguage. We were pushed into it, we learned. And every two weeks I was put up\nuntil I was with my grade level. And I remember that the first, second day, having\nto come home to learn a poem by heart. And not only couldn\u2019t -- I could -- didn\u2019t I\nunderstate it, couldn\u2019t read it. And my 70 year old grandmother said, come child, I\nOctober 17, 2001\nwill learn it with you. She couldn\u2019t read it. But between the two of us, we learned it\nby heart and by the time I got to school, I knew it by heart, but I couldn\u2019t -- I\ncouldn\u2019t say it because I couldn\u2019t -- I didn't know how to pronounce it. I could read\nit. I knew it by heart, but I could -- couldn\u2019t pronounce it. But that -- those things\nwere very quickly rectified and we were very happy in school. The children all\nwore uniforms so it was all -- we were all the same. And it worked out very well.",
        "A: We were enemy aliens. It was really ironic. We had left Germany -- I have to\nthink a minute. We had left Germany as stateless. Jews were no longer considered\nGermans, so we were stateless. And we arrived in Kenya, which at that time was a\nBritish colony, and I don\u2019t know under what quota, under what auspices, but the\nday war broke out, we were considered enemy aliens. And it was rather strange, but\nthat\u2019s what we were and we were enemy alien -- we were stateless until we came to\nAmerica in 1947, when we came under the German quota. Again we were put -- at\nthat point considered Germans.",
        "A: They laughed about it because it was so iro -- ironic. The -- the thing that it real -\n- that it meant physically was, my parents bought a very, very large farm in -- a\nranch in Kenya. And what it came down to was we were interned on the property.\nOctober 17, 2001\nWe were not allowed to leave the property without permission. Any time we wanted\nto go to town -- every week we had to go to Nairobi, which was 20 miles away. We\nlived in the highlands in Limuru, we had to go buy groceries. We had to go to the\npolice department and get permission to go to Nairobi and buy groceries. And --\nbut otherwise it was not a problem. But in the beginning, when we -- when war\nbroke out, everybody was very upset and we were then declared enemy aliens and\nthe British came with the A-African soldiers to arrest my -- all the men that had\nnow come to freedom in Kenya, were arrested, including my 80 year old\ngrandfather. And they were taken to a place of internment for security. And my\ngrandmother at that point said to the British whoever he was, police officer, she\nsaid, now I want you to know something. We fled Germany to safety, to come\nhere. I have been married to this man for 45 years and where he goes, I go. So if\nyou\u2019re going to take my 80 year old husband, I\u2019m going to go with him, he\u2019s not\ngoing to be alone. He looked at my grandmother, he says, okay, we\u2019ll leave him\nhere. And the men were there one or two nights and they came back. They realized\nwhat was going on and looked into their background and they were released. We\nwere, at that time, still living 1n a ho -- in a house that my father had rented in\nNairobi, and that was before we had purchased the ranch. Afterwards, they made it\nOctober 17, 2001\nmandatory that the men help the war effort, and manage the ranches of the British\nthat had gone to war. My uncle became a manager of a farm.",
        "A: None. None whatsoever. First we lived on the farm, and my parents realized we\nneeded to be educated, so they hired tutors for us. The tutors lived in, but we were\nmuch too rambunctious to stay with tutors. We did not -- it did not work out. And\nanother thing that happened was in Africa we grew pyrethrum, which -- of which\nDDT is made. And that was a big business at that time because it was sold -- 1t was\nneeded for the war effort, because America used to get its DDT from Japan, and\nthey couldn\u2019t get it any more. And my mother was terribly, terribly allergic to it.\nHer face would break out and her skin would break. It was just awful. So she could\nnot live on the farm, and the tutor business didn\u2019t work out. So my mother and my\nsister and I moved to Nairobi to town so we -- we could go to school. The first\nsemester or SO we moved to another place in Limuru, and we had to walk down a\nhill, cross the little river and up a hill to go to school. But we didn\u2019t stay there too\nlong. And my father, uncle and grandparents -- on the ranch that we bought there\nwere two large homes. The three brothers and families lived in one and my father\nand uncle and grandparents, and we lived in the other. That had been the quarter --\nOctober 17, 2001\nthe -- the laborers quarters before we bought the farm, and it was very, very dirty\nand it had no inside plumbing. And well, cleaned it up, and we moved in. And -- but\nafter awhile my mother couldn\u2019t live there, and we moved away. My father would\ncome to us on weekends. And we went to school. First we went to Limuru girls\u2019\nschool as day students, which was one of the most exclusive boarding schools there\nwas. Don\u2019t forget, we were in a British colony, and they all had boarding schools.\nThen we went to Nairobi and we went to school there. We went to the Nairobi\ngirls\u2019 high school. Again, very exclusive school. [coughs] Excuse me. And we\nstayed there until we gra -- graduated from high school. And my father stayed on\nthe farm and worked the farms and came to see us on weekends. In addition to that,\nmoney was not plentiful, so we had rented a home in Nairobi and my mother rented\nout rooms to augment her income. And that\u2019s what we did for many, many years.",
        "A: This was after the war.",
        "A: Wait a minute. That\u2019s not true. No, this was during the war. I\u2019m sure they did.\nI\u2019m sure they did, but I don\u2019t think 1t became a -- any trouble.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Yes, many in the Jewish community. There was a nice Jewish community in\nNairobi and people that had been there 20 - 30 years, and yes they did ask us. But\nwe were absorbed into the community, it was really -- living in Nairobi was very,\nvery pleasant.",
        "A: No, not to my knowledge or memory.",
        "A: Not really. I don\u2019t think my parents had that intention because there was\nbasically no Yiddishkeit. There were no -- there were no -- I don\u2019t think there were\nany other Orthodox Jews, except one or two families that had also come as\nimmigrants. And again, it was very difficult to keep any of the observance. So after\nthe war my father was anxious to leave, so that we -- that the children could at least\nbe integrated into an Orthodox community.",
        "A: Their traditions today would be con -- considered Conservative Judaism. Where\nwere they from? From Poland, from England, from all over the world. From\nSomalia, from all over the world. Some were refugees like we were, others were\nOctober 17, 2001\nolder residents that -- I don\u2019t know where they came from, but they had been there\nfor years and years; they were well established. But most of them had Polish\nbackgrounds, so I as -- assumption at this stage loo -- in retrospect is, maybe their\nparents left under the pogroms and settled wherever they could. That\u2019s retrospect.",
        "A: My parents and uncle did as much as they could. While we were on the farm, we\nhad no electricity, but we did have a radio that was battery run. It was only allowed\nto be used for the news, and my uncle and parents followed that very, very closely.\nThey were very concerned about the people they had left behind. We did get some\nmail from them through the Red Cross. They did receive some packages that we\nhad sent, but then after awhile all correspondence stopped, and they were very, very\nconcerned, but there was nothing we could do.",
        "A: We had an inkling that things were very, very bad, but really exactly what was\ngoing on, no. At least -- as teenagers, we were off in another world. But my parents\nand uncles had ideas, but really didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: My parents had ideas, possibly were able to read through the lines what was\ngoing on, but actually no, we did not know until after the war, what was going on.",
        "A: What I remember -- I think I was either 16 or 17 -- the war was over in \u00b045, so I\nwas 16, and at that time -- and came here when I was 17, so when we left Kenya,\nsomeone gave my father a book of pictures of the camps. It was a very new book\nand it was horrendous. It was a horrendous book, he wouldn\u2019t let us look at it. And I\nremember he stood on the end of the ship, he threw it overboard. He could not see\nit, he could not live with those pictures.",
        "A: Well, we became much happier, we went to the movies. We met other young\npeople of our age. It was a -- 1t was a happier time, but cannot be compared to\nAmerican teenagers life. And I had just graduated high school, my sister was still in\nschool, and that\u2019s about the time we left.",
        "A: We got -- at that time we had received our visas and it was time to go. Trip was\nvery long, it was seven weeks on a cargo boat, and was a long trip. We stopped --\nwe stopped in every port from Mombassa, which was Kenya, down to Cape\nOctober 17, 2001\nTown. It was a cargo boat that took on -- was a very interesting trip for us. We went\nashore. Actually, I\u2019ve been into every port from Cairo to Cape Town. Coming --\ncoming from Germany we stopped in -- up there, and went through the Daman\nIsle, and round -- around Aden, we stopped in Aden and then came down, stopped\nin Somalia at that time, and then down to Kenya. And then seven years later we\ncontinued from Kenya to all the small ports. Port Elizabeth, Durbin, and then\nCape Town, and then -- that took four weeks. The trip fr-from -- that -- because\nthey stopped so much. And then it was three weeks up the Atlantic without a stop,\nto Boston. And at the end of that trip there was such a horrendous storm, that we\nwere walking on the walls of the boat. Wasn\u2019t a dish left in the kitchen that was\nwhole. The storm was so bad outside of Boston, that a-although our tickets were for\nNew York, they wouldn\u2019t take us to New York, they said you have to leave in\nBoston, and we took a train to New York. And for -- for my sister and myself it\nwas a wonderful trip. We did everything on that boat. From keeping the logs, from\nsteering the ship, from swabbing the decks. We did everything. We had a wonderful\ntime. And no food. No kosher food. And we had taken some food along, and the\nfunniest thing 1s, after the first day or two my mother refused to eat the bread. Why?\nThe baker of the boat had a monkey that he dipped in the water every day and then\nOctober 17, 2001\nrolled him on the deck like bread. It was a toy -- 1-it was a pet. When my mother\nsaw that, she got so disgusted she wouldn\u2019t eat the bread.",
        "A: In February, 1948. Snow over the houses. No winter coats. Having lived in the\ntropics for seven years. Oh, it was cold. Very cold.",
        "A: Not really. Not really, because you know, we just took it day by day. Whatever\nwe had to do, we did. I started school.",
        "A: Queen\u2019s Plaza, went to stenography school to become a secretary, and after a\nfew weeks I decided I knew enough and I wanted a job and the only job I wanted\nwas on Fifth Avenue. And I took the \u201cNew York Times\u201d and went from -- and\nanything that was Fifth Avenue, I went in and applied for a job. I started way\ndowntown and walked my way up. I think the first one I got was at 23\" Street, but I\nwas so inexperienced, I didn\u2019t last longer than a week there. So, took the \u201cNew\nYork Times\u201d again and started from 23\" Street up to 43\" Street. And finally found\n-- was hired in an attorney\u2019s office, where there were two attorneys and an\naccountant. I knew nothing. Finally, one of the men that hired me -- they must have\nfelt sorry for me, said, do us a favor, go back to school, and learn. And I did. I went\nOctober 17, 2001\nto night school in Queens, worked in Manhattan and lived in Brooklyn. I could\nhave switched schools, but I didn\u2019t. I was too -- too scared. I could have gone to\ncollege, because with the British education that we had, it was qui -- equivalent to\nthe junior year in college. Didn\u2019t do it. [had to work. We -- and I had that job for a\nlong time and I told them I observe the Sabbath, and the one attorney said -- would\ncome to me every aftern -- Friday afternoon, an hour before sunset and say, it\u2019s time\nfor you to go home. Which I thou -- you know, it enabled me to be home before\nsunset. I -- finally I did learn shorthand and stenography and I was able to type. And\nI used to do spreadsheets for the accountant, who was terribly fussy. He would hold\nmy work up to the light and say, you erased, do it over. I learned to erase, he\ncouldn\u2019t tell any more. I worked there -- how long did I work there? A year, year\nand a half? Not -- yeah, til 1950, two years m -- year and a half, maybe. And by\nthen my parents had bought a chicken farm in Vineland, New Jersey. And I was\nliving with an aunt and uncle in Brooklyn. And we belonged to an -- or -- or to a\ncongregation there, and I made friends there and met a lot of young people. And\ndidn\u2019t want to come -- move to Vineland. And I somehow managed financially. I\nwas on my own. When my parents left for New Jersey, my father -- I was renting a\nroom somewhere on the West Side, 96\u2122 Street, and my aunt and uncle had moved\nto Brooklyn. And my father left me with a hundred dollars and he said, when that\u2019s\nOctober 17, 2001\nfinished, it\u2019s yours. And from that day on, I was independent. I got a job, I paid my\nroom and board. Subway was a nickel one way, so all you need 1s a dollar a week\nfor subway, and I was on my own until 1950, when I -- ?50? Yeah, end of 1950. I\nhad met my husband in the fall of 1950 and moved -- and then moved to Vineland\nand became engaged in January of \u201951. And then I st-started to work in Vineland\nfor an attorney who came to my parents\u2019 house and said, I hear you\u2019re a legal\nsecretary, can you come to work for me? And I did. And I worked for him til my\nfirst child was born.",
        "A: To my knowledge, we went to HIAS to fill out citizen papers, period. We had an\nuncle that lived here and a cousin who owned a restaurant on 49\" Street, his name\nwas John Schwartz. He owned Headquarters restaurant. He was Eisenhower\u2019s\nmess sergeant in World War II. He did the Berlin conference for Eisenhower and\nhe was with Eisenhower through the entire campaign. And when he came back, he\nopened a restaurant in -- on 49\" Street in New York City. So we had a lot of help\nfrom -- from the cousins.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: No. No. People didn\u2019t want to talk at that time, they didn\u2019t want to know.",
        "A: It was a blind date in Brooklyn. He lived in -- on the farm in New Jersey, and\nhe would come ou -- he had vacation, and somebody gave me father-in-law my\ntelephone number and he gave it to Werner and he called me and we went out and\nwe enjoyed it, and he -- he was only in New York for a week, and he had just come\nout of the service. And he asked me for lunch the next day. Must have liked me,\nright? I went to lunch with him because to me it was a free lunch. I didn\u2019t -- and\nfrom then on he kept writing, he kept coming to New York. And by the -- by the\nend of the year, the aunt and uncle that I lived with had also moved to Vineland, so\nI went to Vineland. And that\u2019s when we be -- got engaged.",

        "A: I just wanted to say that in general we were very fortunate to be alive, because\nwe left Germany before World War II, in June of \u201939, and we were able to leave\nKenya right before the Mau Mau uprising, be -- because had we stayed in Kenya\nwe would have been right in the center of Mau Mau territory, and we -- the ranch\nthat my parents had bought was not sold at the time, it took several years to be able\nto sell it, and for us to be able to transfer the funds from Kenya to here.",
        "A: Again, my family was very fortunate. On May 1, 1933, one of my uncles took\nlarge sums of money to Holland and banked them in Holland, because after that it\nwas more difficult to get money out. And that\u2019s how we had funds in Holland,\nwhich were then transferred to Africa.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: No, he was born in Germany, and he -- he and his family [coughs] also left\nGermany in 1937 and lived in Holland until 1939, and were then able to come to\nAmerica. He will tell 1t in his story. And they purchased a farm outside of\nCamden, New Jersey, and he will elaborate on that. And in 19 -- w-war broke out\nin 1942 for America, right? \u201941 - \u00b042. He was inducted into the army in 1944,\nagain, as an enemy alien and became a citizen in the army and then was sent back\noverseas to Germany, first as an infantry soldier. He was wounded, and after the\nwar ended he went into mini -- military government as an interpreter. And I think he\nwas discharged 40 -- in 1946, I\u2019m not sure.",

Our second son,\nDavid is an attorney and lives in Highland Park, New Jersey. His offices are in\nPrinceton, New Jersey, and he\u2019s the proud father of five children. Michael has two\nchildren. Our daughter, Debbie is a venture capitalist banker in Pittsburgh,\nworking for PNC, and she has two children. So we have nine grandchildren of\nwhich we are very proud.",
        "A: Oh yes. I worked as a legal secretary until David was born. My mother helped\nme take care of Michael. After that, I didn\u2019t work for about 10 years and had\nanother child, third child, Debbie. And when she was four years old I started to\nwork to sell real estate.

        "A: Yes, definitely.",
        "A: I think everybody should have civil rights and have the freedom to do and work\nin a manner that America was envisioned. And this should be freedom for\neveryone, regardless of color, creed or nationality. But it has to be a safe freedom. It\nhas to be the people that -- just as a comparison that -- what I can say now is that\npre-World War II and during World War II, America would not let any immigrants\nin -- or Jewish immigrants into the country. And looking at it today, which is ninet -\n- oh, 2001, after the terrorist attacks, God knows who\u2019s running through America,\nand nobody checked.

        "A: My sister has lived in this area for 25 years. We were ready to retire. In addition\nto that, our mother was in a nursing home in Atlantic City, about which we were\nnot too happy, and we were able to have her transferred to the Hebrew Home of\nGreater Washington. And it was quite a long trip to visit her. The trip from\nVineland to Washington is about three hours. And we were retired, there was no\nreason for us to live in Vineland. Was more and more difficult to be observant Jews\nin Vineland, because the observant synagogues were closing. And this is what my\nhusband and I wanted in our life, to have community that observes and be together\nwith my sister and be able to see my mother, who died a year ago.",
        "A: I think it was April of \u201998. My brother-in-law and sister have volunteered at the\nmuseum from before it opened, and they thought that would be a good place for us\nto spend some time. So we went down and we do translations now.",
        "A: Insights. We were -- we feel very good about being able to translate the letters,\nwhich are heart-wrenching at times. They are the gifts to the museum of mostly\nOctober 17, 2001\ngrandchildren of people that have perished because they were not able to get out.\nAnd these -- and this correspondence is the grandparents writing to the parents. And\nthe parents saved these letters, and the grandchildren can\u2019t read them any more.\nSome of them are in German script that both my husband and I can still read. Some\nof them are very difficult to decipher and terribly heart-wrenching to read.",
        "A: No, not really, because we work behind the scenes. We don\u2019t see the public. We\ngo into the Ross building, have our little cubicle and spend our day there and go\nhome.",
        "A: I used to speak to schoolchildren in -- in New Jersey, and I have done it once\nhere because one of the teachers asked me to come to a class. Now, I\u2019ve not done\nno s -- | have not done any s -- public speaking.",
        "A: Yeah. The first time we returned to Germany was at my sister\u2019s urging because\nthe city of Cologne invited us as their guests for a week. I did not want to go but my\nsister said, come on, let\u2019s go. And we did. It was a good week, it was a structured\nweek. It was planned by the city. We were treated royally. But I kept looking over\nOctober 17, 2001\nmy shoulder to see who was following me. If I saw a German Shepherd, I ran. I was\nnot a happy camper. This time we were in Europe for three weeks and we just\nspent four days in Germany because our son wanted to see, quote unquote, his\nroots. And he was able to fly over for four days, rent a car and we went to the town\nthat my father was born in. We went to the town that my mother was born in, and\nwe went to the town where our great-grandmother was buried. And after that we\nreally had enough of the autobahn and we went on to Holland and he went home.",
        "A: The only people that we really met in Germany were hotel personnel, and we\nhadn\u2019t -- th -- and then of course we were treated ex -- like royalty by the people\nthat had the castle. We were also treated extremely well by the daughter of my\naunt\u2019s maid, who treated us like royalty. Very sweet, very nice and -- extremely\nnice, but these people were nice to us before. We didn\u2019t meet any new ones. I had a\n-- | had an experience on the first trip which really shocked me. We were at a dinner\nplanned by the city, with teachers, because at that time we had gone over and we\nspoke to classes in Germany. And one of the teachers sitting next to me, she says, I\nhave to admit to you, my mother is a Nazi to this day. I was speechless. So anybody\nI saw that was my age or older, I considered to be a Nazi.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Oh, okay. The two cousins that stayed behind to the very end were able to\npurchase a -- that -- a Torah scroll that was saved from one of the synagogues and\nthey brought it to Kenya. In Kenya we used it because we had services on the\nholidays. The family had five adult males and during the war my mother ha-had\nmany, many Jewish soldiers, from England, from Africa, from -- from South\nAfrica, from America, that would come for rest and recuperation to our farm. And\nso for the holidays they always kept -- if they were still in Kenya, we\u2019d always\ncome back. And the Torah scroll was used in Kenya all the time. When we came to\nAmerica, a Torah scroll was used in a small country synagogue outside of\nVineland, called Brockmanville. And when we left the area, we took the Torah\nscroll with us again. It is not kosher any more, it cannot be used as as -- Torah\nscroll. So not knowing what to do with it, not wanting to bury it, we donated it as a\ngift to KMS synagogue in Silver Spring, who gratefully accepted it and built a\nbeautiful orann for it, and it s-stands in their bet-hamek in the small synagogue,\nand it is taken out once a year on Simchas Torah, when everybody dances with it.\nAnd I feel that 1s a beautiful place for it because it\u2019s still being used for what it was\nintended for.\nOctober 17, 2001",
