And they started to work on papers to\nget my brother in law and my sister out of Germany. My brother spoke English. And he and the\nfamily here in Brooklyn worked on the papers and got them ready just before the war broke out.\nThis is one of the few cases where I\u2019ve heard that the Germans let a person leave the\nconcentration camp to come to America.

But when they came to my grandmother\u2019s bedroom, they opened the door\nand saw this old lady and they closed the door and never touched her or touched that room.\nSomething else dreadful. My grandmother was 93 years old and she had sugar diabetes for a long\ntime. But that was old age which is not very bad. But in the meantime she developed gangrene in\nher toes, her foot whatever it was. And the family held a, got together on the phone and they\ndecided that it was, this was not the time to have grandma operated on and have her sitting in a\nwheelchair so they decided to let it go. And let grandma die. She was 93 years old. One thing I\nremember though coming back to grandma, before we left Germany we had a big, big party in\nKoln and celebrated grandma\u2019s 90\" birthday.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Oh her name was Helen, Helena Dahl. And that, that\u2019s one time where I saw my whole\nfamily probably never to see again but this is when we went to Koln and celebrated Grandma\u2019s\nbirthday.",
        "Q: You were in Holland and you started school and it was a public school with non-Jews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Any problem",
        "A: No, no problem, no problems at all. It was very, very, well I had to start a new language.",
        "Q: Did you know any Dutch?",
        "A: Yeah I spoke it. I spoke it because I would go and visit with my grandmother and my\ngrandfather. But",
        "Q: And so what do you mean you started a new language?",
        "A: Well I, I in school I had to learn to write it and, and don\u2019t forget whatever I did was\nverbal. And I had to start a new language. But",
        "Q: And the neighborhood was mixed.",
        "A: The neighborhood was absolutely mixed. We did have a little synagogue on the second\nfloor of a store and again it was Orthodox with me sitting in front and the women sitting in the\nback. it was a very nice but a very small Jewish community. but enough to have a little\nsynagogue and \u2014",
        "Q: Then Kristallnacht happened and you heard",
        "A: That they had taken my brother in law away.",
        "Q: And then what, what was the next change?",
        "A: Let me think what happened to Kristallnacht to other people. Let me get my thought\ntogether. (pause)",
        "Q: We were talking about what happened at Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Well that was in Germany. Let me go back to Holland since we moved there. Everything\nwent very smooth. I had my maiden aunts living in Maastricht which is another city close to\nwhere we lived in Valkenburg. And my brother lived with us and he spent time with my aunts\nbecause they were you know they were by themselves. Until May 10\" 1940 that\u2019s one morning\nwe woke up ---",
        "Q: All of 1939",
        "A: Nothing happened. I mean everything was fine.",
        "Q: You led a normal \u2014",
        "A: Led a normal life.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with your friends back home in Germany.",
        "A: We had contact with the family.",
        "Q: But not with your friends.",
        "A: No, no, no. We, we did have contact with the family . some that left Germany and\neverybody that left Germany came through Holland, came to our house and visited with us. our\nhouse was like a haven for people that went from one place to another. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you feel bad not being in touch with friends? From Germany?",
        "A: No, not, I don\u2019t know. not really, not really.",
        "Q: Did you have any social life in Germany, any boyfriends?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t leaving any \u2014",
        "A: No, nobody mm, mm. no. If you were raised by a father like mine, you don\u2019t date til\nyou\u2019re 18. I was not allowed to date til I was 18 years old. And I remember not being able, lived\nin Holland. There was a dance and my father wouldn\u2019t let me go, not even with my brother. I\nwasn\u2019t 18 years old. Very strict house.",
        "Q: So 1939 was relatively quiet and your father was able to conduct business.",
        "A: Right and I went to school.",
        "Q: And you went to school?",
        "A: Well until May 10\" 1940 we got up very early in the morning, 5:00 in the morning and\nthe sky was dark, dark with airplanes that had come. And the Germans were coming in and\ntrying to overrun Holland which they did in five days. I remember the soldiers walking down\nour street.",
        "Q: German soldiers?",
        "A: German soldiers. My mother was in the hospital in Maastricht. She had a my mother had\nangina and she was there for a, for their own soldiers that got hurt.",
        "Q: The Dutch soldiers?",
        "A: The Dutch, the German soldiers.",
        "Q: Oh the German soldiers.",
        "A: German soldiers. I mean the German soldiers needed that room and set anybody that was\nable to leave the hospital so you had to come home. That made, that was devastating. I mean\nyou had this poor woman that had a heart condition had to come home. We were scared. We\nknew what was going to be. We knew what was coming and here we just left Germany in 1938\nto be overrun again in five days. And that was the most frightening and experiences. One of the\nmost frightening experiences in my lifetime.",
        "Q: Where did you stay during those five days?",
        "A: Oh we stayed in our, oh no, no, no. We had catacombs across the street. and during\nsometimes during those attacks we stayed in the catacombs. That people, there were people that\ndied in the catacombs. There were babies born in the catacombs but that was just across the street\nfrom our house. In the, there were small mountains. Holland doesn\u2019t have any mountains and\nthe little town where I used to live, Valkenburg, had the biggest mountain there is in Holland. If\nyou look it up in the dictionary it\u2019s called aculvert. It\u2019s, I mean you walk up, it\u2019s absolutely\nnothing to it. it but it\u2019s the biggest mountain Holland. And Valkenburg has catacombs and it\u2019s\nvery damp in there.",
        "Q: This was in the mountainside",
        "A: In the mountain side absolutely.",
        "Q: So you and your family went in.",
        "A: Oh yes we \u2014",
        "Q: When there would be raids.",
        "A: When there would be raids, we just went into the mountain.",
        "Q: Did you take \u2014",
        "A: Take food and blankets and all that and when it was clear we just went out.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay in \u2014",
        "A: Well Holland was overrun in five days so it didn\u2019t\u2019 last very long.",
        "Q: Did you stay the five days in there?",
        "A: Not quite. In and out, in and out, in and out yes. Because we didn\u2019t\u2019 have to stay there.\nIt was just across the street. If we would have lived far away we probably would have stayed\nthere for a while, but we stayed. Anyway we were very scared and \u2014",
        "Q: What did you do when you were scared. By this time you\u2019re 18 years old",
        "A: Well I was, you know I could, I was out of school. And what did we do. I really, oh no,\nno, no. I started to learn to sew. I went and went to a seamstress and started to learn to sew, that\u2019s\nwhat I did. Everybody did this because one didn\u2019t know if you had to go into a different country.\nyou couldn\u2019t speak the language. AT least you had an occupation that you could support\nyourself which I had to do when I came to this country. I was a seamstress. And that was, that\nhappened to most of my family. Some became cooks, some became bakers. The girls all became\nseamstresses because with the idea",
        "Q: So now it\u2019s those five days and then what happened.",
        "A: And well nothing happened immediately but we\u2019re here we are in 1940. But things\nbecame changed very, very rapidly. We had to go and sign up I guess.",
        "Q: Register",
        "A: Register. Who were Jews. And so they knew exactly who lived where and how many\nJews there were in this little town. Then we had to give up our radios. We had to give up our\nbicycles.",
        "Q: Were you angry?",
        "A: Scared. Angry. Why me? Why am I different. I\u2019m not different than anybody else. I\nthink they took my dad\u2019s business away again. They gave us stars to wear.",
        "Q: Where did you wear your star?",
        "A: On my left side and we had to secure the star on every corner because if a wind would\nblow then the star would fall over and it had to be clear that it had to be secured on every corner,\nthe star. All six points.",
        "Q: Did you sew your own stars on.",
        "A: No my mother did all that. I didn\u2019t\u2019 do anything. But my mother lined it so it would be\nmore sturdy and then she put all the pins on. I was a spoiled child. I didn\u2019t do any of that.",
        "Q: Were you upset to have to wear a star?",
        "A: Yes, yes why would I be different than anybody else. I just didn\u2019t\u2019 want to be different.\nWhy should I be different than anybody else. We had curfews. We could not be out in the dark.\nWe could not leave town. We had to stay in town. We couldn\u2019t\u2019 move around. And it was\nabsolutely frightening. You had no more liberty. You had no more way of earning a living. You\nwere different than anybody else and scary. Very, very scary.",
        "Q: Did you talk this over with your parents?",
        "A: Yes we talked about it, but what could we do. There was nothing that we could do. In the\nmeantime I got postcards from my girlfriends from Germany who had been taken to\nconcentration camps. And what the postcard always said, it said only one or two sentences but\nthe sentences were always the same. So we knew that there were, if they wanted to write, they\nwere forced to write the same thing. But we didn\u2019t know where they were. There was no address.\nThere was nothing on it. I could never return their postcards. And we were very, very scared\nand frightened. A lot of my dad\u2019s family was taken to a concentration camp and never heard\nfrom again. But these were all older people already, people that didn\u2019t\u2019 want to leave Germany.\nPeople that were of means. People that didn\u2019t\u2019 have anywhere to go or may even try to go\nanywhere. Because they felt that this is where I live and I\u2019ve never done anything wrong and I\ndon\u2019t want to go anywhere. Well, here we are in 1941. And we have all these liberties taken\naway.",
        "Q: Did you have enough food?",
        "A: Yes, yes that we had. We always had enough food in the house.",
        "Q: How did you get the food, your father wasn\u2019t working.",
        "A: Imagine we had enough money to buy the food. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember what happened to our\ncar. I couldn\u2019t tell you that. But we were told to get ready and pack knapsacks. For I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow how many days, clothing, food and everything so when the Germans come to our house\nthat we were ready to be taken away. One -",
        "Q: Who told you this?",
        "A: The Germans did. One",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: I guess we got notices in the mail probably. It\u2019s not all very clear to me anymore. But I\ndo remember one day in 1942, I think it was about June or July, 1942. There was a knock on our\ndoor and they would come and to get me. In the meantime, I was sick. I got sick. I don\u2019t know\nhow lucky I was that the doctor that we had in Holland told them that I could not be moved. And\nI by a miracle they let me stay. I stayed in bed from months at a time, putting white powder on\nmy face to tell people that I was sick. I had to be afraid of my neighbors because some of my\nJewish neighbors were taken away and here I was as a young girl, 20. In bed. My mother did\neverything. She, I would not get out of bed. My mother took care of the house as sick as she\nwas. And like I said it\u2019s a miracle that they didn\u2019t\u2019 come after me at another time. But in the\nmeantime my two maiden aunts were taken away in Maastricht. My brother said I\u2019m not going\nto let these ladies go by themselves. They\u2019re very frail. They\u2019re old. They are absolutely the most\nwonderful people who never hurt a fly. They were ladies of means. My grandfather was an\nantique dealer. And I will go with them. He volunteered to go with them. Not knowing that he\nwas never with them because I found out later through the Red Cross that as soon as they came\nto Auschwitz that they were killed immediately. And but my brother who went was young, he\nwas 11 years older than I was. He was sent to work camp. And I don\u2019t\u2019 know where he died but\nI know that he lived through I guess work camps, concentration camps, til the end. And he died\neither in Badwamvorn which I guess is a work camp or in Auschwitz. I am not sure. But he died\nof typhoid of probably two days before he was liberated. So that was our oldest one in the\nfamily.",
        "Q: So here you are in bed with white powder ---",
        "A: With white powder on my face. Another time they came to get my mother but you should\nhear the screaming and the carrying on and she was sick. And they did not take her either. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened. They must have felt so sorry for us. That they let us stay. People were\ntaken away and people disappeared. We did not know what happened. My father had a friend in\nanother city. He also was a cattle dealer and he said, I don\u2019t know how they got together. He\nsaid how come that people are disappearing and he said if you go to the post office and there is a\ngentleman and you ask for his fictitious name, Mr. Jansen, he will tell him that you want to\nspeak with him. We had been moved from our single house to a house that had a lot of stores\nand a lot of rooms and they put all of us Jewish people there together. So if they had another raid\nthat they didn\u2019t have to go from house to house. That we were just all there. I don\u2019t\u2019 know how\nthey moved me. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember anything but I remember having been moved to this house\nwhere all these storefronts were changed into places for us to live. Well my father went to Mr.\nJansen and he told us that he could help us. that he would help us to go in hiding, if we were\nwilling to and my father said anything, anything you can do for us he did. Well of course it was\nvery difficult to find houses, to find places for us to go. He got in touch with us. It must have\nbeen before another transport came. And he had found one place for the three of us but we never\nwanted to be together because if we were found the whole family would have been destroyed.\nThe man came to our house and at night and got some, I guess my mother had suitcases ready\nwith a few little things for us to wear. I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember what I wore, what I had. I, I can\u2019t\ntell you. I really don\u2019t remember. But I know that he came the night before or a couple nights\nbefore and picked up a couple of suitcases and he said yes he had secured a place for us. We\nhad to leave early in the morning. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. We had to go up the hill, but that was\nduring a time that we were not allowed on the street. We had to wear our star. And we walked\nup the hill where he came with a car and took us away. You left everything, everything you\nowned. Everything you had you just left behind because all you had were what you wore and a\nfew things I guess clothing that he took. I remember coming to this place and it was a coal miner\nwhere we, where he wanted us to stay. It was a very small townhouse and the person made\nsecure to tell the neighbors that she was getting company for the weekend.",
        "Q: This is 1942.",
        "A: It\u2019s 1942 already.",
        "Q: What month or what time of year?",
        "A: This was 19, I don\u2019t\u2019 know if this was already 19, the end of 1942, already 1943.",
        "Q: So it was winter time.",
        "A: Winter time. And well everybody was indoors so they just snuck us into this house but it\nwas a very small house and this person was a coal miner. And my father had the hardest time.\nHaving been an outdoor person all his life it was like you had a lion in a cage. My mother had a\nterrible time with him because he had to be quiet. He couldn\u2019t speak loud. I guess, I don\u2019t\u2019 even\nremember he was used to smoking. I guess he couldn\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. My mother\nreally had an awful, awful time with him. But we stayed in this one house. He stayed, they\nstayed in this one house I guess just for a few days until they found somewhere else for them to\ngo. My mother and dad. I never really saw them after that until after the war.",
        "Q: What were your feelings when they had to leave?",
        "A: Scared, frightened but \u2014",
        "Q: What did they say to you? When they had to leave.",
        "A: Well we cried, we hugged each other but we had no other choice. You have, you are, you\nhave no idea how hardened you are during that time. All you do is think about your safety,\nyourself, that you make it til the end if there is an end. And you just live from minute to minute\nand day to day. You don\u2019t know if you get caught while being transported. You don\u2019t\u2019 know if\nyou get caught. In the house. If the neighbors would hear something and they would go and\nsqueal on you. You really lived in fright, you were frightened 24 hours a day at all times. But so\nwere the people that you stayed with. Don\u2019t\u2019 forget, if they would have found us, they would\nhave killed me. They would have killed them. They would have killed the whole family. And",
        "Q: Do you remember their names?",
        "A: No, absolutely not. that\u2019s frightening about being old. I should have written 1t down\nwhich I did not. I neglected.",
        "Q: They did give you the names at the time.",
        "A: Oh absolutely. Oh yes, they knew my name. I knew their name. we lived a normal life.\nThe only thing is I had to fit into this life. I wasn\u2019t used to eating rabbits which were free of\nration. And I remember in that particular house she made rabbit. Just the thought of it, coming\nfrom a kosher home to eating rabbits. I wouldn\u2019t eat it. and lo and behold I didn\u2019t get anything\nelse. I was hungry, just smelling this rabbit and looking at it I couldn\u2019t do it. But the next time\nwhen she served rabbit, I ate the rabbit because I was hungry. We did get rations from the\nunderground. The underground did supply us with rations which was a big help. But this one\nman helped us during the time, all this time, all the time we were in hiding and if we needed help\nhe would help us to find another place. And you know that this man never got paid, never he did\nit all on his own.",
        "Q: This is Mr. Jansen?",
        "A: Mr. Jansen. And he was, he had, he was a single person who lived with a, he had a lady\nthat did his housework and she was in with this. because sometimes if you had to go, we knew\nwhere to go. We knew where to go overnight if we needed help so I tell you, you were so\nhardened. You had to live from minute to minute that you don\u2019t think. You absolutely don\u2019t\u2019\nthink. but there was a time another girl came in.",
        "Q: Your parents left and so you\u2019re still in that first ---",
        "A: I\u2019m still in that first house. Then he needed the room for somebody else.",
        "Q: Your room, he needed your room or your parents.",
        "A: No he needed to, I was there and then he brought another single girl in. He, you know\nsometimes you don\u2019t\u2019 have places and so there were two of us. Bu the people didn\u2019t like this\ngirl. She was not clean. She was not friendly. She just didn\u2019t fit and before we knew it they asked\nher to leave.",
        "Q: A Jewish girl?",
        "A: A Jewish girl from Amsterdam, absolutely. I stayed there for a while and it was hard.\nThe air raids started to come in. And every time there was an air raid we had to be fully dressed,\nfully ready to leave the house, run out for two reasons. Number one the when the air raids were\nsometimes, airplanes would be shot down. There would be shot and the pilots and that were in\nthose airplanes would try to hide and would sometimes people would give them hiding places.\nSo if they were, there was an airplane that was down and the pilots were missing well we were\nsurrounded and if they would have found us it was just I mean they would have killed us\nimmediately. That went on for a while. But then the people got very nervous. They had me for a\nwhile and they said enough of it already. You need to leave. Where did they send me? They\nsent me",
        "Q: Before you left did you do anything specifically during the day, not during air raids but\njust generally. What did you do?",
        "A: Just helped them in the house. But I had to be very careful that I could not be seen. And\nnot be heard. That the toughest thing is they had to lead a regular life. Remember they were\ngoing for one day at a time. they were going to on a little vacation. Then I had to sit in the attic. I\nhad my food in the attic and I had my little potty in the attic and that\u2019s where I stayed. I could not\nmove. I sat in this in the attic until they were ready to come home. because if they would have\nheard noise then people would say well they\u2019re gone for the day, what is who is in that house.\nAnd by luck maybe they would have called the Germans. By luck they might have called\nsomebody and said well let\u2019s go in there. you never know what other people\u2019s minds are. So if\nthey were going, if they were going shopping, or they were going somewhere or doing anything\nup in the attic I went.",
        "Q: Did friends come over to visit them?",
        "A: No, they never had any friends come over. I think they did have some family come over\nbut then they were aware of where I was and who I was. No. they never had any entertainment\nor, they were plain people.",
        "Q: Then they came to you and said you have to leave.",
        "A: You have to leave so they had to, they had to contact Mr. Jansen and they had to find a\nplace for me.",
        "Q: Were they getting paid?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: From your father?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: To protect you?",
        "A: Yes. Nobody did anything for nothing. But look, it meant a whole lot of money for us.\nBut for them, if you take the risk that these people took and the agony and the frightening you\ncould not pay them enough. You wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me enough to do it. you could not pay\nthem enough so this little bit of money really didn\u2019t\u2019 mean anything as long as everything went\nwell.",
        "Q: You contacted Mr. Jansen?",
        "A: I contacted, we, they contacted Mr. Jansen and I don\u2019t\u2019 know if I went to this, let\u2019s say I\ndon\u2019t know in order where I went. But I went one time I went to a doctor\u2019s house. It was a big\nhouse and they had a maid. They used to have two maids but the one maid just left so they\nneeded a maid to be in the house. And well I wasn\u2019t used to doing maid\u2019s work. We always had\nhelp in the house until the last minute we had help in the house. Well they told me what to do. I\nhad to go on my hands and knees to do the floors. And the other maid said to me and looked at\nmy knees. She says you don\u2019t have maid\u2019s knees. I said what are maid\u2019s knees. She says you\nhaven\u2019t crawled on the floor long enough to have flat knees. Well, I got scared. I told the owner\nof the house that I had to leave. Because I didn\u2019t\u2019 have maid\u2019s knees so she probably could figure\nout that I wasn\u2019t used to doing this kind of work. I remember I needed to leave immediately.\nAnd this is one time that I walked over to Mr. Jansen\u2019s house. I knew approximately where he\nwas.\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0010.02.02 - duration: 43:54)",
        "Q: You were talking about how you went over to Mr. Jansen\u2019s house.\nRUTH GREIFER: Yes, that was like a little haven to be until the next house was available for us.\nI don\u2019t really remember who and how I got my clothing. It must have been that took charge of,\narranged for all of this. Well , here he took us. He took me to a house where my parents had\nbeen and my parents had to leave because they were squealed on and the girl that squealed on\nthem was killed by the underground. Anyway, can you believe that after this had died down, that\nthey were willing to take another human being, another Jewish person to be in their house. Well I\ncame there.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: That was Mr. and Mrs. Robertson. And their only daughter Katie. The house was built\non the outskirts between two small towns. We didn\u2019t have, we had only \u2014",
        "Q: Are we still talking about Valkenburg. Is that where you still --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m in. No the places that were, was in hiding 1s all in the vicinity of Hallen,\nHulsberg, Terblijt. These are all small coal mining towns. And this is where Mr. Jansen was\nable to place us. Here, but \u2019m coming back to go to the Robertsons\u2019 house. The Robertson\nhouse was on a road that was between two, not cities, two small towns and they have never\ngotten together. Who\u2019s going to put in electricity. Who\u2019s going to put in water supply. We didn\u2019t\nhave any water supply except for a well in the back yard. And there was no electricity. We only\nhad kerosene and the only heating place in the house was the stove in the kitchen. It was very\nprimitive but the people were absolutely wonderful. I stayed there and we had another lady\nGerman Jewish from Heidelberg. She was used to a lot of money. Her parents had a cigar\nfactory. And she was, she had a hard time being, adjusting, being the person. Nobody. You are\nabsolutely a nobody. You are at the mercy of people. If they\u2019re good to you then it\u2019s fine. If not,\nit\u2019s a hard time and a different way of life. Don\u2019t forget a little carafe of water had to last us for\none week. I slept with Katie in a single bed. When she turned I had to turn. When I turned she\nhad to turn. Our linens was washed. The bed linens were washed every two months. Because\nthey would hang the clothes out and people would probably watch how often you wash. So they\nwere used to washing once a month so once a month this bed was being changed and the next\nmonth this bed was being changed. Our clothing wasn\u2019t changed for at least once a week. And\nlike I said our water, we had a little carafe that had to last us one week. But look, you do\nanything to keep your life. I was asked once did you make plans. When you were in hiding and\nthey were so amazed. I said no I didn\u2019t make any plans because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to\nlive the next day or the next morning or the next minute. Because I didn\u2019t know where I was\ngoing to be. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us if I ever survived. We couldn\u2019t tell.\nThe people were very good to us. The food was ample. We ate probably potatoes three times a\nday which was fine.",
        "Q: Do you remember the parents\u2019 first names?",
        "A: No, no. I know that he was a coal miner and a farmer and the woman didn\u2019t\u2019 work. And\nKatie delivered the newspapers. That\u2019s all I know.",
        "Q: So you stayed inside the house?",
        "A: Inside the house all the time. All the time.",
        "Q: And what did you do there?",
        "A: I knitted. I remember that they had knit sweaters and they would pull them out. And\nthen I knit them bigger for somebody you know for somebody else. This kind of stuff. People\nasked me if I read. No. I never read. There was no reading material in those houses.",
        "Q: What happened to your Jewish star that you had?",
        "A: The Jewish star, I didn\u2019t have it with me. That was back in Valkenburg with somebody\nelse. I never had it with me. I have it here but I don\u2019t\u2019 have \u2014",
        "Q: You left it with somebody?",
        "A: I left it with somebody.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re with the Robertsons.",
        "A: I\u2019m with the Robertsons and yes, I remember one moment that was closer already when\nthe, you know they were, the Germans were dug in, in front of the house. We Anna and I, Anna\nis the other lady. We were downstairs and what we were doing downstairs I don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nAnyway the German soldiers come in the back entrance and coming into the house. And here\nwe are. There\u2019s the kitchen and here is the French door. And here is a round table and we could\nnot get out of that room to go upstairs. The poor soul asked these German soldiers in the kitchen\nentertained them, gave them coffee, gave whatever she had and she probably knew that we were\nin the adjacent room. The adjacent room had a round table and long table cloth. Under the table\nin the next room. You don\u2019t know how frightened we were. You don\u2019t know how scared we\nwere. If we had coughed, that would have been the end of us. They would have said who is in\nthere. Let\u2019s go see. Because they\u2019re aware. They knew that people were in hiding and they knew\nexactly what was going on. You don\u2019t\u2019 know the fright and how scared we were. I don\u2019t know. it\nprobably lasted three days to us but it didn\u2019t last that long. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember how long it lasted.\nBut thank god we survived that particular incident. You had to live. They had to live a normal\nlife. And just fill in because people knew exactly how they lived. Friday mornings she would go\ninto town and buy her groceries. I mean everything had to be just so. The clothes that were hung\nout had to be just normal. Not more, not one piece more than another because people in small\ntowns know exactly what the next person does. I really don\u2019t remember how long I stayed with\nthem. Until I had to leave again. And I don\u2019t know if they got scared of us. You know there\u2019s\njust so much time that you can spend with a person that\u2019s a fugitive. I absolutely was a fugitive\nin that house.",
        "Q: They were also getting paid.",
        "A: Yes, everybody.",
        "Q: Everybody. Did you have contact with the underground there?",
        "A: The, I tell you what happened. Well we at certain times we ran out of money. So the\nunderground would go back to Valkenburg where we had things and I don\u2019t know got in contact\nwith friends of ours. I don\u2019t know if they sold things or whatever happened. I really don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nI never asked my father how did you get the money.",
        "Q: This was the Dutch underground.",
        "A: The Dutch underground.",
        "Q: The Dutch Jewish underground just the Dutch underground.",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t a Jew in sight. Mm, mm. Just the regular Dutch underground. And then\nI was transported pretty far away from Hulsberg to Treebeek. And I got into a house where I\nwas upstairs. And now I didn\u2019t like it that much but I had no other choice. And in that house\nalso was another girl. And this girl had problems. She had polyps. And I think that they were\nable to get a doctor in that house to help her. I don\u2019t know if he operated in that house. I don\u2019t\nknow whatever happened. But I know that I didn\u2019t\u2019 like it there but I had no other place to go.\nAnd this was already close towards the end of the war. I remember being at Katie\u2019s house. She\nhad a radio and we listened to the invasion. And we followed that but we didn\u2019t know how long\nit would take before the liberation came if there ever was a liberation. One didn\u2019t\u2019 know. But\nthat I know we had in Katie\u2019s house.",
        "Q: And that was June of 44.",
        "A: Yes. Right. So here I am in Treebeek in this other house with more people and the\nbombing got heavier. And I remember being so scared. Here we are and it was we didn\u2019t know\nhow soon the liberation came. And I remember I was so scared that I went down in the basement\nand there was a potato bin. And I crawled into the potato bin and I don\u2019t know how often I sat in\nthat potato bin. And how long I sat in that potato bin. Because when the Americans came to\nliberate us the house was in front of a big coal pile. And the Germans would sit on this side and\nshoot over your house and Americans came across. It was a big field. I\u2019ll never forget the\nAmericans came across with their tanks and infantry. And we were told to stay in the basement\nbecause we didn\u2019t\u2019 know who was going to stay. Who was going to be pushed back. And I know\nthat a, some of the American soldiers got hurt. But do you know that we were afraid to come out\nof the basement for days. We didn\u2019t know if they were going to stay. We didn\u2019t\u2019 know if they\nwere going to be thrown back and but we did get liberated, September 17\" 1944. That was early\nbut still scared. Absolutely frightened to death to even tell people well here I am. I\u2019m Jewish.\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m liberated now. I\u2019m free. For three days we did not come out. We were scared,\nabsolutely scared, scared, scared. Then I gota call or we got a call from Mr. Jansen that my\nparents had gone back to Valkenburg.",
        "Q: You were still in the house.",
        "A: I was still in the house. They already had gone. Well we didn\u2019t have a place to go. We\ndid not have anywhere because the house that was rented was not ours. We didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the liberation. What were your feelings?",
        "A: What were our feelings. Oh god. You have no idea. I could have kissed every soldier that\nthere was. I you know",
        "Q: These are the first Americans.",
        "A: First Americans. First Americans that I\u2019ve , that Isaw. And",
        "Q: What kind of things did they say to you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even, I don\u2019t\u2019 even know that I told them that I was Jewish. I just was so, so\nhappy to be free, afraid. Don\u2019t forget how long have I been afraid. How long have I been in\nunderground. How long have I been living with people, scared For 24 hours all these months.\nThere was not a wink that I could say I could smile. I could enjoy, I could live. It was will I ever\nbe able to be free. Will I ever be able to live. It was I don\u2019t know. I guess I lived so intimidated\nthat I was scared. And to be free. There were so many questions. What happened to my family.\nOh god. What happened to my family. Ok. Mr. Jansen came and got me and brought me to my\nparents. Well we didn\u2019t\u2019 know where we were going to live we didn\u2019t\u2019 \u2014",
        "Q: This is back in Valkenburg.",
        "A: Back in Valkenburg. There was a Jewish family that \u2014",
        "Q: When you first saw your parents.",
        "A: Oh my goodness.",
        "Q: What were your feelings?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t, didn\u2019t recognize my mother. My mother did not eat. She could not stand the\nthought of pork, bacon. She couldn\u2019t stand the smell in the house. She wouldn\u2019t eat. My mother\nweight about 80 some pounds when she came out of hiding. And she was absolutely what shall I\nsay, devastated. Here we are. but she knew that my brother had left. Her two sisters had left.\nAnother sister with a husband and son had left. And she didn\u2019t know what happened to them.\nShe wouldn\u2019t eat. She just existed. And well my father, he, he was a different type of person.\nThey spoke with the family that owned this big house. And they asked my parents to move in\nwith them. That\u2019s funny. We did not have a chair to sit on. We did not have a bed to sleep on but\nwhat the Dutch government did, they went into the apartments that the Germans deserted, that\nthe Germans left behind and gave us furniture and beds and chairs to sit on and beds to sleep in.\nAnd they gave us enough that we could live in this house. This young couple also was in hiding\nbut the elder couple, the elderly couple had been taken away. Of course they never returned and\nlet me tell you something, how people take things different than others. One day and I\u2019m coming\nback to the people that we lived with. I went upstairs in an attic to hang up clothing. Here this\nyoung man who asked us to come and move in with them tried to hang himself. He tried to\ncommit suicide because his parents did not return and he had an absolute nervous breakdown.\nWell we didn\u2019t have a telephone in our house. I went to the doctor and he was committed for a\nwhile because he had a complete nervous breakdown. Anyway we stayed in this house. Let me\nthink. We lived in this house. We didn\u2019t have any windows in the house. The windows were all\nbroken from the bombs and there were all put together with wood. Let me think. Can you turn it\noff.",
        "A: All right, the transports were coming in. And",
        "Q: You\u2019re with your parents.",
        "A: I\u2019m living with my parents and the transports were coming in and my father still hoped\nthat my mother was alive. He would stand at the",
        "Q: Train station.",
        "A: At the train station all day long. From morning til night and when he found out\neventually he thought that my brother would never come home. My mother and I would go into\ntown to Maastricht where she was born and where my family used to live and we would go,\nmaybe we would go shopping. Or we would do something. And people would come and say\naren\u2019t you the sister of the Dahl Miss basements. And she said they looked so much alike. And\nlet me tell you it killed her. My mother died literally of heartbreak because her older son, her\nonly son was killed in a concentration camp. Her two maiden aunts, sisters were killed. Her other\nsister and the husband and son were killed. My whole Dutch family is not there anymore. I\u2019m the\nonly survivor of my Dutch family. There is nobody left. The only ones that are left are at the\ncemetery. And my mother is buried in Maastricht. And my grandparents and my great\ngrandparents. But I am the only survivor. I didn\u2019t want to stay in Holland. I felt that as a Jewish\ngirl I didn\u2019t\u2019 have much of a chance. Even so, I had been begged to stay. They needed young\ngirls to marry Jewish men so there would be a continuation of the Jewish people in Holland. And\nI said no I\u2019m not going to do that. I am, my sister lived here and she was willing to send papers\nfor me to come to America. I don\u2019t know one, sometimes I ask myself did I do the right thing to\nleave my parents. But having been through so much in my young life that I felt that I wanted to\nstart a new life. Not really realizing how hard it is to start a new life. Because you turn a leaf\nover and you start all over again. I left my parents. And I came to America.",
        "Q: How did you get here?",
        "A: Literally on the boat. I came over on the New Amsterdam. And as soon as I got off the\nboat, the first word my sister said to me is speak only English. No other language 1s spoken in\nour house.",
        "Q: What day did you arrive in the United States?",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. I have it all written down. 1948.",
        "Q: In the spring",
        "A: In the spring. And they she picked, she and my brother in law picked me up and we went\nto Kittaning Pennsylvania which is about 40 miles out of Pittsburgh. That\u2019s where they ended\nup and I don\u2019t know how and why but that\u2019s it. I stayed with them for six months to learn the\nAmerican way of life. I remember that their friends were absolutely wonderful to me. They, I\nspent time with them. They taught me the American way. They invited me to the country club.\nThey had brothers that took me out on a date. It was absolutely wonderful frightening\nexperience for me being in this country. I spoke English pretty well because we were liberated\nby the Americans and I went to, we went to services with the American soldiers. And",
        "Q: Religious services?",
        "A: Yes the Jewish soldiers came to our synagogue and brought, and they had their rabbi that\nbrought everything. And then they came to our house for tea afterwards and this is how I learned\nto speak. Well I spoke English but I learned to speak much better. But anyway one day my\nsister said after having been there for six months, it\u2019s about time for you to go and get a job. So I\ntook the bus into Pittsburgh and I applied, went to some stores. Department stores, ready to wear\nstores and the first time I didn\u2019t\u2019 get anything. Well a couple weeks later you know there\u2019s a\nslow season in August. Things pick up in September. I went back in and I got a job. I got a job\nat Max Asens that was a store that only sold furs, coats and suits. And here this gentleman gave\nme a job. I was scared to death because really I hadn\u2019t done much sewing for a long, long time.\nBut I had to have a place to stay.",
        "Q: The three years that you were with your folks \u2014",
        "A: I just stayed home with them.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t work.",
        "A: No",
        "Q: Ok so now you have your first job.",
        "A: And now I have my first job. And well I had to have a place to stay. Well my sister\u2019s\nfriend had an aunt in Pittsburgh who lived, had an apartment over a restaurant and she was\nwilling to take me in. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have a room by myself. I had, I lived, I shared a bedroom with\nher. And I shared the apartment with her and it was difficult. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have really the freedom\nthat I wanted but I couldn\u2019t\u2019 afford more. And she was happy to have me because she used this\nmoney to send, help send her son to law school. It was hard. it was hard, but then again I had\nhelp. My sister\u2019s friends sent somebody, sent young ladies over to pick me up and take me to\nHadassah meetings. And this way I was introduced to Hadassah and a Jewish way of life. And\nknow that there was a ride. And I wanted to take in everything. I went to the Y. I went\nswimming at the Y. I and through the Hadassah I made friends. I made girlfriends and it was\nhard. I was by myself. And I had to live on $25 a week. I had to pay room and board and I had to\neat and I had to dress myself. But I did it. I was very poor. I remember sometimes if I didn\u2019t\u2019\nhave any money I ate M&Ms for dinner. And I remember I got paid on Monday morning and I\nwould go into town just enough money to pay the car fare and I probably had a penny left. But\nthat was fine. I mean I got used to that. I didn\u2019t\u2019 want anything from anybody. I supported\nmyself.",
        "Q: Were you in contact with your parents at all at that time?",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. But my mother got very sick. And my mother died. That left my dad\nby himself. There was nobody that could take care of him except my aunt Lisian from London.\nShe also was a widow but she had gone to London with her son. She did not live through the\nHolocaust. My Aunt Lisian came and stayed with my father. And took care of him. And but\nshe also had to leave with her son, daughter in law and granddaughter to emigrate to Israel. So\nDad was alone. But in the meantime the papers were ready and my sister and brother in law and\nagain the family from his family from Brooklyn gave him the papers to come to America. And\ndad moved in with my sister. I was still working and living in Pittsburgh when let me think now.\nI can you turn off.",
        "A: I started to take, I wanted to take everything in when I came to Pittsburgh. I went I saved\nenough money to go and see the Icecapades by myself. I took the cheapest ticket and I know that\nI was, I had the ticket that I couldn\u2019t\u2019 see anything so I walked around. I stood all evening. I\nwanted to make up for all the years that I lost. I took myself to the theater by myself. I went, I\nsat in peanut heaven. All the way in the back just enough to see the shows that I had missed. I\nwanted to make up for all the time and my girlfriends say to me you go out on a Saturday night\nby yourself. If I don\u2019t\u2019 have a date on Saturday night I don\u2019t\u2019 even answer the phone. I said this\ndoesn\u2019t make any difference to me. I want to go and make up and see everything and do\neverything that I\u2019ve never been able to do. I didn\u2019t care if I had a date. I didn\u2019t care if I, I just\nwanted to see everything. But anyway here I was at the Y and everybody played bridge. My\nsister played bridge. They all played bridge and lo and behold I was going to take bridge lessons\nat the Y. Signed up and here there are all of these young single men taking bridge lessons with\nme. Paul Beder wanted to date me and he said to Bernie I\u2019m going to date this girl and Bernie\nsays no I\u2019m going to date this girl. I want her telephone number. So Bernie introduced Paul\nBeder to somebody else who eventually got married. And we started to date. I met Bernie\nplaying bridge at the Y. Date, not hyphen, on and off. Well there was a national Hadassah\nconvention in town and every eligible single woman, single men from all around Pittsburgh area,\nOhio, came to this Hadassah convention. It was a very snowy night and my girlfriend and I we\ntook a cab down to the William Penn Hotel. Get up to the top floor wherever this big thing was.\nAnd we walk around and walk around.

Helen already was\nborn here in Alexandria and then Eve also. They are absolutely so dear to me that I wouldn\u2019t\u2019\nknow what to do without them, because we don\u2019t\u2019 have family.

        "A: The war has influenced me to the point that I am the person that said you should not hate\nGermans. You should forgive and forget. Well I am of the opposite end. When I hear somebody\nspeak German, I get such fury in me, I cannot take it. Even so on my own side, my dad I had to\nspeak German to. I have cousins in Brazil that when I write to them I have to think in German. I\nwrite to them in German because their mother tongue now is Portuguese. My mother tongue 1s\nEnglish. Yes, they speak English but not well enough to write letters. So when I write to my\ncousins in and we are in constant contact, I have to write in German. I want to forget Germany.\nI want to forget the German language. I want to forget the German country because it ruined, it\nhas destroyed everything I had. There are some members of my family that are in very close\ncontact with us but I am one of the youngest ones alive. And when we are gone, our whole big\nfamily is no more. But my feelings about Germany. I have, I have friends now, people that I\nwent to school with that want to be friends with me. They invite me to come and visit. They want\nme to stay at their house. I don\u2019t know if I have",

I don\u2019t, I would like to go back and the only reason that I would go back for would be to\nvisit the graves. The graves of my grandparents in Geilenkirchen. I have grandparents, I think\ngreat grandparents probably over there. and the grave of my mother in Holland. With my\ngrandparents and great grandparents in Holland. And I know when mother died that they had had\nthe names of my brother and my aunts and family put in. So no I have no feeling for Germany.\nAbsolutely not. Germany has ruined my, not my life.

        "A: To the doctor across the street. He bought our house and we, the house was absolutely\nbeautiful and we had we always had a gardener come in, two gardeners. One that shaped the\ntrees and one that would do all the planting. We had vegetables in our yards, and we had every\nimaginable flowers and fruits. And my father would never let us pick the fruit because when he\ncame home from work he wanted to go in the yard and just pick it right off the vine. And oh\none thing I remember. My mother did a lot of canning, a lot of, lot of canning and fresh fruit and\nvegetables and we had all winter long we had fresh vegetables and fruit. And I remember\npotatoes for the whole winter in the basement. And something that I do remember and one\ndoesn\u2019t have it here. you know you don\u2019t have the room, you don\u2019t\u2019 have the space and.",
        "A: Oh it was big. We had the house was above the ground and we did have a garage and we\nhad room for, for the cows in the wintertime. And we had a, a nut tree.",
        "A: No cows on the side, next to the garage. No",
        "A: No it was, it was all made out of brick. It was quite sturdy.",
        "A: Oh absolutely, absolutely. The, we walked up the stairs and then we went into the foyer\nand the foyer was made out of mosaic. And the kitchen floor was made out of mosaic. And I\nremember that I would walk on stilts and the maid had scrubbed it and it was so shiny and then I\nfell. We had a, a living room. Big kitchen with two tables. And we had another room where the\nseamstress was, used to come and sew. And we had one room where we never went in. only the\npiano and the real good furniture were there. And then upstairs we had, how many bedrooms.\nProbably 3 or 4 and then upstairs we had an attic and, and a room where the maid slept.",
        "A: Pretty much, yeah, yeah. but very, very nice living. My mother after she got married she\nnever worked.",
        "A: Then we moved to Holland. And \u2014",
        "A: Well we had an entrance because mother had been Dutch. It was easier for us to get in\nthan \u2014",
        "A: Probably cause mother had been Dutch and we rented a house.",
        "A: I think we just went to the, a furniture truck, I mean a moving van. And I remember it\nwas small. It just kept going back and forth. I don\u2019t even know how we got all this furniture in\nthat little house.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I guess my dad drove us. Yeah my dad.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Valkenburg.",
        "A: That is it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a little summer resort town in, well it\u2019s near Maastricht and I tell you\nnobody ever hears about these little towns where I come from. Anyway it was also a small town,\nbut my dad absolutely had to start business all over again, which was very hard because he\nwasn\u2019t that young any more. he had to start with new clients and new just can you imagine at his\nage. To have to start a new business. But you know when you have to do things, you\u2019re very\nstrong. And where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way. But we had a Jewish neighbor there next door,\nalso a, you know lived two doors over. He also had come in from Germany and he also was a\ncattle dealer. But everybody did their own thing. They were not in business together.",
        "A: No, not the, not the Catholic friends, no. The Jewish friends yes.",
        "A: How old was I?",
        "A: 16. I guess. I mean look you had to go. There was no way that we could stay in\nGermany so I, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t\u2019 really remember this. Yes, it was sad but \u2014",
        "A: No. No because I was used to going to Holland because \u2014",
        "A: My no, yes, my grandfather lived in Maastricht with my grandmother and two maiden\naunts and we would go on weekends, like in a Sunday morning we would get in the car and visit\nwith grandma and grandpa and my aunts. Stay there for dinner and come home. And that, that\nwas natural for us. I mean we were used to going to Holland and when I was little I would go on\nvacation and stay with my grandparents and my two maiden aunts in Maastricht. And you know\nfor me it was just nothing special.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They would have liked to have gone with us. Because they felt just as unsafe as we did.\nAnd oh yes, they would have loved to have gone to Holland. But at that time to go to Holland it\nwas like a haven. It was a safety, not knowing that they came after us, but at that time for us it\nwas a haven. And for me, for us to go to Holland we were used to going to Holland.",
        "A: No, mm, mm. No. No.",
        "A: Right, it\u2019s another small town and \u2014",
        "A: My father\u2019s family in 1938. All 11 of them, ok.",
        "A: Ok, my father came of a family of eleven. Seven brothers, there were seven brothers and\nfour sisters. And 19, one died, Robert died of a natural death. He just got sick, I don\u2019t\nremember what he died of. But he died in Germany of a natural death. The others were all still\nin Germany. My father always said I\u2019ve never done anything. I\u2019m an honest citizen. I he was in\nWorld War I, he was a soldier. I don\u2019t want to leave. He absolutely did not want to leave and\nnone of them wanted to leave. They were all very, they were merchants. None of these people\never went to college or school. In fact my father only had a seventh grade education. He had to\ngo to work because he was an orphan at that time, already. And very few left Germany because\nthey said why should we leave. We haven\u2019t done anything and we\u2019ll just stay. There was only\none aunt. She was a widow because her husband got killed in World War I. She and three of her\nchildren went to Brazil. And that is really one of the few families that stayed intact, because they\nleft Germany.",
        "A: Right and",
        "A: Well I don\u2019t\u2019 know if he never conferred with us. He started to do business as a cattle\ndealer. I don\u2019t\u2019 know if he had friends, if he went with somebody but he made a living.",
        "A: Spring.",
        "A: Yes. And in the meantime my sister had gotten married. She stayed in Germany. My\nbrother came to Holland and he lived with us part time and he lived with my maiden aunts at the\ntime. and my sister got married just before we left Germany and she stayed in Germany with her\nhusband. In Duren, D-U-R-E-N.",
        "A: Not in 1938, I didn\u2019t see anybody. Well you saw the Hitler Youth and you say the SS\nand you saw the SR and I couldn\u2019t\u2019 participate in anything. Absolutely. But \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Well they wouldn\u2019t look at me anymore. They just would not look at me.",
        "A: Yes that I used to play with.",
        "A: Well I was hurt but I couldn\u2019t, I mean if they tell you, you can\u2019t play with somebody you\njust don\u2019t\u2019 go. We just don\u2019t play with anybody. I had my little Jewish friends to play with. and\nwe were the first ones to leave because of my dad\u2019s business. And that\u2019s why none of these\npeople left Germany and that\u2019s why none of these people survived. I\u2019m the only one that\nsurvived.",
        "A: Business right.",
        "A: Yes, I did go to school.",
        "A: Just the regular public school. And that was in 1938, Spring 1938. That was before\nKristallnacht and",
        "A: The, well the summer came. I went to school and then on Kristallnacht it was when they\ntook all the Jewish men in, in Germany. But they took my brother in law to Dachau. And my\nsister was all alone at that time. The only good thing was that my brother in law had blood\nrelatives in America whom they had been in contact with. And they started to work on papers to\nget my brother in law and my sister out of Germany. My brother spoke English. And he and the\nfamily here in Brooklyn worked on the papers and got them ready just before the war broke out.\nThis is one of the few cases where I\u2019ve heard that the Germans let a person leave the\nconcentration camp to come to America. And this happened to my brother in law. They let \u2014",
        "A: Rudy Rose and they let him out of Dachau to come to the United States.",
        "A: Well the family kept in touch because we had all these brothers and sisters in Germany\nand \u2014",
        "A: It was absolutely dreadful. One of my aunts lived in Solvengin and this is where my\ngrandmother was at the time. They destroyed the SS or whoever came in the house, destroyed\neverything in the house. There was not a chair to sit on. there was not a cup to drink out of. They\ndestroyed everything. But when they came to my grandmother\u2019s bedroom, they opened the door\nand saw this old lady and they closed the door and never touched her or touched that room.\nSomething else dreadful. My grandmother was 93 years old and she had sugar diabetes for a long\ntime. But that was old age which is not very bad. But in the meantime she developed gangrene in\nher toes, her foot whatever it was. And the family held a, got together on the phone and they\ndecided that it was, this was not the time to have grandma operated on and have her sitting in a\nwheelchair so they decided to let it go. And let grandma die. She was 93 years old. One thing I\nremember though coming back to grandma, before we left Germany we had a big, big party in\nKoln and celebrated grandma\u2019s 90\" birthday.",
        "A: Oh her name was Helen, Helena Dahl. And that, that\u2019s one time where I saw my whole\nfamily probably never to see again but this is when we went to Koln and celebrated Grandma\u2019s\nbirthday.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no problem, no problems at all. It was very, very, well I had to start a new language.",
        "A: Yeah I spoke it. I spoke it because I would go and visit with my grandmother and my\ngrandfather. But",
        "A: Well I, I in school I had to learn to write it and, and don\u2019t forget whatever I did was\nverbal. And I had to start a new language. But",
        "A: The neighborhood was absolutely mixed. We did have a little synagogue on the second\nfloor of a store and again it was Orthodox with me sitting in front and the women sitting in the\nback. it was a very nice but a very small Jewish community. but enough to have a little\nsynagogue and \u2014",
        "A: That they had taken my brother in law away.",
        "A: Let me think what happened to Kristallnacht to other people. Let me get my thought\ntogether. (pause)",
        "A: Well that was in Germany. Let me go back to Holland since we moved there. Everything\nwent very smooth. I had my maiden aunts living in Maastricht which is another city close to\nwhere we lived in Valkenburg. And my brother lived with us and he spent time with my aunts\nbecause they were you know they were by themselves. Until May 10\" 1940 that\u2019s one morning\nwe woke up ---",
        "A: Nothing happened. I mean everything was fine.",
        "A: Led a normal life.",
        "A: We had contact with the family.",
        "A: No, no, no. We, we did have contact with the family . some that left Germany and\neverybody that left Germany came through Holland, came to our house and visited with us. our\nhouse was like a haven for people that went from one place to another. And \u2014",
        "A: No, not, I don\u2019t know. not really, not really.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, nobody mm, mm. no. If you were raised by a father like mine, you don\u2019t date til\nyou\u2019re 18. I was not allowed to date til I was 18 years old. And I remember not being able, lived\nin Holland. There was a dance and my father wouldn\u2019t let me go, not even with my brother. I\nwasn\u2019t 18 years old. Very strict house.",
        "A: Right and I went to school.",
        "A: Well until May 10\" 1940 we got up very early in the morning, 5:00 in the morning and\nthe sky was dark, dark with airplanes that had come. And the Germans were coming in and\ntrying to overrun Holland which they did in five days. I remember the soldiers walking down\nour street.",
        "A: German soldiers. My mother was in the hospital in Maastricht. She had a my mother had\nangina and she was there for a, for their own soldiers that got hurt.",
        "A: The Dutch, the German soldiers.",
        "A: German soldiers. I mean the German soldiers needed that room and set anybody that was\nable to leave the hospital so you had to come home. That made, that was devastating. I mean\nyou had this poor woman that had a heart condition had to come home. We were scared. We\nknew what was going to be. We knew what was coming and here we just left Germany in 1938\nto be overrun again in five days. And that was the most frightening and experiences. One of the\nmost frightening experiences in my lifetime.",
        "A: Oh we stayed in our, oh no, no, no. We had catacombs across the street. and during\nsometimes during those attacks we stayed in the catacombs. That people, there were people that\ndied in the catacombs. There were babies born in the catacombs but that was just across the street\nfrom our house. In the, there were small mountains. Holland doesn\u2019t have any mountains and\nthe little town where I used to live, Valkenburg, had the biggest mountain there is in Holland. If\nyou look it up in the dictionary it\u2019s called aculvert. It\u2019s, I mean you walk up, it\u2019s absolutely\nnothing to it. it but it\u2019s the biggest mountain Holland. And Valkenburg has catacombs and it\u2019s\nvery damp in there.",
        "A: In the mountain side absolutely.",
        "A: Oh yes we \u2014",
        "A: When there would be raids, we just went into the mountain.",
        "A: Take food and blankets and all that and when it was clear we just went out.",
        "A: Well Holland was overrun in five days so it didn\u2019t\u2019 last very long.",
        "A: Not quite. In and out, in and out, in and out yes. Because we didn\u2019t\u2019 have to stay there.\nIt was just across the street. If we would have lived far away we probably would have stayed\nthere for a while, but we stayed. Anyway we were very scared and \u2014",
        "A: Well I was, you know I could, I was out of school. And what did we do. I really, oh no,\nno, no. I started to learn to sew. I went and went to a seamstress and started to learn to sew, that\u2019s\nwhat I did. Everybody did this because one didn\u2019t know if you had to go into a different country.\nyou couldn\u2019t speak the language. AT least you had an occupation that you could support\nyourself which I had to do when I came to this country. I was a seamstress. And that was, that\nhappened to most of my family. Some became cooks, some became bakers. The girls all became\nseamstresses because with the idea",
        "A: And well nothing happened immediately but we\u2019re here we are in 1940. But things\nbecame changed very, very rapidly. We had to go and sign up I guess.",
        "A: Register. Who were Jews. And so they knew exactly who lived where and how many\nJews there were in this little town. Then we had to give up our radios. We had to give up our\nbicycles.",
        "A: Scared. Angry. Why me? Why am I different. I\u2019m not different than anybody else. I\nthink they took my dad\u2019s business away again. They gave us stars to wear.",
        "A: On my left side and we had to secure the star on every corner because if a wind would\nblow then the star would fall over and it had to be clear that it had to be secured on every corner,\nthe star. All six points.",
        "A: No my mother did all that. I didn\u2019t\u2019 do anything. But my mother lined it so it would be\nmore sturdy and then she put all the pins on. I was a spoiled child. I didn\u2019t do any of that.",
        "A: Yes, yes why would I be different than anybody else. I just didn\u2019t\u2019 want to be different.\nWhy should I be different than anybody else. We had curfews. We could not be out in the dark.\nWe could not leave town. We had to stay in town. We couldn\u2019t\u2019 move around. And it was\nabsolutely frightening. You had no more liberty. You had no more way of earning a living. You\nwere different than anybody else and scary. Very, very scary.",
        "A: Yes we talked about it, but what could we do. There was nothing that we could do. In the\nmeantime I got postcards from my girlfriends from Germany who had been taken to\nconcentration camps. And what the postcard always said, it said only one or two sentences but\nthe sentences were always the same. So we knew that there were, if they wanted to write, they\nwere forced to write the same thing. But we didn\u2019t know where they were. There was no address.\nThere was nothing on it. I could never return their postcards. And we were very, very scared\nand frightened. A lot of my dad\u2019s family was taken to a concentration camp and never heard\nfrom again. But these were all older people already, people that didn\u2019t\u2019 want to leave Germany.\nPeople that were of means. People that didn\u2019t\u2019 have anywhere to go or may even try to go\nanywhere. Because they felt that this is where I live and I\u2019ve never done anything wrong and I\ndon\u2019t want to go anywhere. Well, here we are in 1941. And we have all these liberties taken\naway.",
        "A: Yes, yes that we had. We always had enough food in the house.",
        "A: Imagine we had enough money to buy the food. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember what happened to our\ncar. I couldn\u2019t tell you that. But we were told to get ready and pack knapsacks. For I don\u2019t\u2019\nknow how many days, clothing, food and everything so when the Germans come to our house\nthat we were ready to be taken away. One -",
        "A: The Germans did. One",
        "A: I guess we got notices in the mail probably. It\u2019s not all very clear to me anymore. But I\ndo remember one day in 1942, I think it was about June or July, 1942. There was a knock on our\ndoor and they would come and to get me. In the meantime, I was sick. I got sick. I don\u2019t know\nhow lucky I was that the doctor that we had in Holland told them that I could not be moved. And\nI by a miracle they let me stay. I stayed in bed from months at a time, putting white powder on\nmy face to tell people that I was sick. I had to be afraid of my neighbors because some of my\nJewish neighbors were taken away and here I was as a young girl, 20. In bed. My mother did\neverything. She, I would not get out of bed. My mother took care of the house as sick as she\nwas. And like I said it\u2019s a miracle that they didn\u2019t\u2019 come after me at another time. But in the\nmeantime my two maiden aunts were taken away in Maastricht. My brother said I\u2019m not going\nto let these ladies go by themselves. They\u2019re very frail. They\u2019re old. They are absolutely the most\nwonderful people who never hurt a fly. They were ladies of means. My grandfather was an\nantique dealer. And I will go with them. He volunteered to go with them. Not knowing that he\nwas never with them because I found out later through the Red Cross that as soon as they came\nto Auschwitz that they were killed immediately. And but my brother who went was young, he\nwas 11 years older than I was. He was sent to work camp. And I don\u2019t\u2019 know where he died but\nI know that he lived through I guess work camps, concentration camps, til the end. And he died\neither in Badwamvorn which I guess is a work camp or in Auschwitz. I am not sure. But he died\nof typhoid of probably two days before he was liberated. So that was our oldest one in the\nfamily.",
        "A: With white powder on my face. Another time they came to get my mother but you should\nhear the screaming and the carrying on and she was sick. And they did not take her either. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened. They must have felt so sorry for us. That they let us stay. People were\ntaken away and people disappeared. We did not know what happened. My father had a friend in\nanother city. He also was a cattle dealer and he said, I don\u2019t know how they got together. He\nsaid how come that people are disappearing and he said if you go to the post office and there is a\ngentleman and you ask for his fictitious name, Mr. Jansen, he will tell him that you want to\nspeak with him. We had been moved from our single house to a house that had a lot of stores\nand a lot of rooms and they put all of us Jewish people there together. So if they had another raid\nthat they didn\u2019t have to go from house to house. That we were just all there. I don\u2019t\u2019 know how\nthey moved me. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember anything but I remember having been moved to this house\nwhere all these storefronts were changed into places for us to live. Well my father went to Mr.\nJansen and he told us that he could help us. that he would help us to go in hiding, if we were\nwilling to and my father said anything, anything you can do for us he did. Well of course it was\nvery difficult to find houses, to find places for us to go. He got in touch with us. It must have\nbeen before another transport came. And he had found one place for the three of us but we never\nwanted to be together because if we were found the whole family would have been destroyed.\nThe man came to our house and at night and got some, I guess my mother had suitcases ready\nwith a few little things for us to wear. I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember what I wore, what I had. I, I can\u2019t\ntell you. I really don\u2019t remember. But I know that he came the night before or a couple nights\nbefore and picked up a couple of suitcases and he said yes he had secured a place for us. We\nhad to leave early in the morning. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. We had to go up the hill, but that was\nduring a time that we were not allowed on the street. We had to wear our star. And we walked\nup the hill where he came with a car and took us away. You left everything, everything you\nowned. Everything you had you just left behind because all you had were what you wore and a\nfew things I guess clothing that he took. I remember coming to this place and it was a coal miner\nwhere we, where he wanted us to stay. It was a very small townhouse and the person made\nsecure to tell the neighbors that she was getting company for the weekend.",
        "A: It\u2019s 1942 already.",
        "A: This was 19, I don\u2019t\u2019 know if this was already 19, the end of 1942, already 1943.",
        "A: Winter time. And well everybody was indoors so they just snuck us into this house but it\nwas a very small house and this person was a coal miner. And my father had the hardest time.\nHaving been an outdoor person all his life it was like you had a lion in a cage. My mother had a\nterrible time with him because he had to be quiet. He couldn\u2019t speak loud. I guess, I don\u2019t\u2019 even\nremember he was used to smoking. I guess he couldn\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. My mother\nreally had an awful, awful time with him. But we stayed in this one house. He stayed, they\nstayed in this one house I guess just for a few days until they found somewhere else for them to\ngo. My mother and dad. I never really saw them after that until after the war.",
        "A: Scared, frightened but \u2014",
        "A: Well we cried, we hugged each other but we had no other choice. You have, you are, you\nhave no idea how hardened you are during that time. All you do is think about your safety,\nyourself, that you make it til the end if there is an end. And you just live from minute to minute\nand day to day. You don\u2019t know if you get caught while being transported. You don\u2019t\u2019 know if\nyou get caught. In the house. If the neighbors would hear something and they would go and\nsqueal on you. You really lived in fright, you were frightened 24 hours a day at all times. But so\nwere the people that you stayed with. Don\u2019t\u2019 forget, if they would have found us, they would\nhave killed me. They would have killed them. They would have killed the whole family. And",
        "A: No, absolutely not. that\u2019s frightening about being old. I should have written 1t down\nwhich I did not. I neglected.",
        "A: Oh absolutely. Oh yes, they knew my name. I knew their name. we lived a normal life.\nThe only thing is I had to fit into this life. I wasn\u2019t used to eating rabbits which were free of\nration. And I remember in that particular house she made rabbit. Just the thought of it, coming\nfrom a kosher home to eating rabbits. I wouldn\u2019t eat it. and lo and behold I didn\u2019t get anything\nelse. I was hungry, just smelling this rabbit and looking at it I couldn\u2019t do it. But the next time\nwhen she served rabbit, I ate the rabbit because I was hungry. We did get rations from the\nunderground. The underground did supply us with rations which was a big help. But this one\nman helped us during the time, all this time, all the time we were in hiding and if we needed help\nhe would help us to find another place. And you know that this man never got paid, never he did\nit all on his own.",
        "A: Mr. Jansen. And he was, he had, he was a single person who lived with a, he had a lady\nthat did his housework and she was in with this. because sometimes if you had to go, we knew\nwhere to go. We knew where to go overnight if we needed help so I tell you, you were so\nhardened. You had to live from minute to minute that you don\u2019t think. You absolutely don\u2019t\u2019\nthink. but there was a time another girl came in.",
        "A: I\u2019m still in that first house. Then he needed the room for somebody else.",
        "A: No he needed to, I was there and then he brought another single girl in. He, you know\nsometimes you don\u2019t\u2019 have places and so there were two of us. Bu the people didn\u2019t like this\ngirl. She was not clean. She was not friendly. She just didn\u2019t fit and before we knew it they asked\nher to leave.",
        "A: A Jewish girl from Amsterdam, absolutely. I stayed there for a while and it was hard.\nThe air raids started to come in. And every time there was an air raid we had to be fully dressed,\nfully ready to leave the house, run out for two reasons. Number one the when the air raids were\nsometimes, airplanes would be shot down. There would be shot and the pilots and that were in\nthose airplanes would try to hide and would sometimes people would give them hiding places.\nSo if they were, there was an airplane that was down and the pilots were missing well we were\nsurrounded and if they would have found us it was just I mean they would have killed us\nimmediately. That went on for a while. But then the people got very nervous. They had me for a\nwhile and they said enough of it already. You need to leave. Where did they send me? They\nsent me",
        "A: Just helped them in the house. But I had to be very careful that I could not be seen. And\nnot be heard. That the toughest thing is they had to lead a regular life. Remember they were\ngoing for one day at a time. they were going to on a little vacation. Then I had to sit in the attic. I\nhad my food in the attic and I had my little potty in the attic and that\u2019s where I stayed. I could not\nmove. I sat in this in the attic until they were ready to come home. because if they would have\nheard noise then people would say well they\u2019re gone for the day, what is who is in that house.\nAnd by luck maybe they would have called the Germans. By luck they might have called\nsomebody and said well let\u2019s go in there. you never know what other people\u2019s minds are. So if\nthey were going, if they were going shopping, or they were going somewhere or doing anything\nup in the attic I went.",
        "A: No, they never had any friends come over. I think they did have some family come over\nbut then they were aware of where I was and who I was. No. they never had any entertainment\nor, they were plain people.",
        "A: You have to leave so they had to, they had to contact Mr. Jansen and they had to find a\nplace for me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Nobody did anything for nothing. But look, it meant a whole lot of money for us.\nBut for them, if you take the risk that these people took and the agony and the frightening you\ncould not pay them enough. You wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me enough to do it. you could not pay\nthem enough so this little bit of money really didn\u2019t\u2019 mean anything as long as everything went\nwell.",
        "A: I contacted, we, they contacted Mr. Jansen and I don\u2019t\u2019 know if I went to this, let\u2019s say I\ndon\u2019t know in order where I went. But I went one time I went to a doctor\u2019s house. It was a big\nhouse and they had a maid. They used to have two maids but the one maid just left so they\nneeded a maid to be in the house. And well I wasn\u2019t used to doing maid\u2019s work. We always had\nhelp in the house until the last minute we had help in the house. Well they told me what to do. I\nhad to go on my hands and knees to do the floors. And the other maid said to me and looked at\nmy knees. She says you don\u2019t have maid\u2019s knees. I said what are maid\u2019s knees. She says you\nhaven\u2019t crawled on the floor long enough to have flat knees. Well, I got scared. I told the owner\nof the house that I had to leave. Because I didn\u2019t\u2019 have maid\u2019s knees so she probably could figure\nout that I wasn\u2019t used to doing this kind of work. I remember I needed to leave immediately.\nAnd this is one time that I walked over to Mr. Jansen\u2019s house. I knew approximately where he\nwas.\n(file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0010.02.02 - duration: 43:54)\nthey were willing to take another human being, another Jewish person to be in their house. Well I\ncame there.",
        "A: That was Mr. and Mrs. Robertson. And their only daughter Katie. The house was built\non the outskirts between two small towns. We didn\u2019t have, we had only \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2019m in. No the places that were, was in hiding 1s all in the vicinity of Hallen,\nHulsberg, Terblijt. These are all small coal mining towns. And this is where Mr. Jansen was\nable to place us. Here, but \u2019m coming back to go to the Robertsons\u2019 house. The Robertson\nhouse was on a road that was between two, not cities, two small towns and they have never\ngotten together. Who\u2019s going to put in electricity. Who\u2019s going to put in water supply. We didn\u2019t\nhave any water supply except for a well in the back yard. And there was no electricity. We only\nhad kerosene and the only heating place in the house was the stove in the kitchen. It was very\nprimitive but the people were absolutely wonderful. I stayed there and we had another lady\nGerman Jewish from Heidelberg. She was used to a lot of money. Her parents had a cigar\nfactory. And she was, she had a hard time being, adjusting, being the person. Nobody. You are\nabsolutely a nobody. You are at the mercy of people. If they\u2019re good to you then it\u2019s fine. If not,\nit\u2019s a hard time and a different way of life. Don\u2019t forget a little carafe of water had to last us for\none week. I slept with Katie in a single bed. When she turned I had to turn. When I turned she\nhad to turn. Our linens was washed. The bed linens were washed every two months. Because\nthey would hang the clothes out and people would probably watch how often you wash. So they\nwere used to washing once a month so once a month this bed was being changed and the next\nmonth this bed was being changed. Our clothing wasn\u2019t changed for at least once a week. And\nlike I said our water, we had a little carafe that had to last us one week. But look, you do\nanything to keep your life. I was asked once did you make plans. When you were in hiding and\nthey were so amazed. I said no I didn\u2019t make any plans because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to\nlive the next day or the next morning or the next minute. Because I didn\u2019t know where I was\ngoing to be. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us if I ever survived. We couldn\u2019t tell.\nThe people were very good to us. The food was ample. We ate probably potatoes three times a\nday which was fine.",
        "A: No, no. I know that he was a coal miner and a farmer and the woman didn\u2019t\u2019 work. And\nKatie delivered the newspapers. That\u2019s all I know.",
        "A: Inside the house all the time. All the time.",
        "A: I knitted. I remember that they had knit sweaters and they would pull them out. And\nthen I knit them bigger for somebody you know for somebody else. This kind of stuff. People\nasked me if I read. No. I never read. There was no reading material in those houses.",
        "A: The Jewish star, I didn\u2019t have it with me. That was back in Valkenburg with somebody\nelse. I never had it with me. I have it here but I don\u2019t\u2019 have \u2014",
        "A: I left it with somebody.",
        "A: I\u2019m with the Robertsons and yes, I remember one moment that was closer already when\nthe, you know they were, the Germans were dug in, in front of the house. We Anna and I, Anna\nis the other lady. We were downstairs and what we were doing downstairs I don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nAnyway the German soldiers come in the back entrance and coming into the house. And here\nwe are. There\u2019s the kitchen and here is the French door. And here is a round table and we could\nnot get out of that room to go upstairs. The poor soul asked these German soldiers in the kitchen\nentertained them, gave them coffee, gave whatever she had and she probably knew that we were\nin the adjacent room. The adjacent room had a round table and long table cloth. Under the table\nin the next room. You don\u2019t know how frightened we were. You don\u2019t know how scared we\nwere. If we had coughed, that would have been the end of us. They would have said who is in\nthere. Let\u2019s go see. Because they\u2019re aware. They knew that people were in hiding and they knew\nexactly what was going on. You don\u2019t\u2019 know the fright and how scared we were. I don\u2019t know. it\nprobably lasted three days to us but it didn\u2019t last that long. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember how long it lasted.\nBut thank god we survived that particular incident. You had to live. They had to live a normal\nlife. And just fill in because people knew exactly how they lived. Friday mornings she would go\ninto town and buy her groceries. I mean everything had to be just so. The clothes that were hung\nout had to be just normal. Not more, not one piece more than another because people in small\ntowns know exactly what the next person does. I really don\u2019t remember how long I stayed with\nthem. Until I had to leave again. And I don\u2019t know if they got scared of us. You know there\u2019s\njust so much time that you can spend with a person that\u2019s a fugitive. I absolutely was a fugitive\nin that house.",
        "A: Yes, everybody.",
        "A: The, I tell you what happened. Well we at certain times we ran out of money. So the\nunderground would go back to Valkenburg where we had things and I don\u2019t know got in contact\nwith friends of ours. I don\u2019t know if they sold things or whatever happened. I really don\u2019t\u2019 know.\nI never asked my father how did you get the money.",
        "A: The Dutch underground.",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t a Jew in sight. Mm, mm. Just the regular Dutch underground. And then\nI was transported pretty far away from Hulsberg to Treebeek. And I got into a house where I\nwas upstairs. And now I didn\u2019t like it that much but I had no other choice. And in that house\nalso was another girl. And this girl had problems. She had polyps. And I think that they were\nable to get a doctor in that house to help her. I don\u2019t know if he operated in that house. I don\u2019t\nknow whatever happened. But I know that I didn\u2019t\u2019 like it there but I had no other place to go.\nAnd this was already close towards the end of the war. I remember being at Katie\u2019s house. She\nhad a radio and we listened to the invasion. And we followed that but we didn\u2019t know how long\nit would take before the liberation came if there ever was a liberation. One didn\u2019t\u2019 know. But\nthat I know we had in Katie\u2019s house.",
        "A: Yes. Right. So here I am in Treebeek in this other house with more people and the\nbombing got heavier. And I remember being so scared. Here we are and it was we didn\u2019t know\nhow soon the liberation came. And I remember I was so scared that I went down in the basement\nand there was a potato bin. And I crawled into the potato bin and I don\u2019t know how often I sat in\nthat potato bin. And how long I sat in that potato bin. Because when the Americans came to\nliberate us the house was in front of a big coal pile. And the Germans would sit on this side and\nshoot over your house and Americans came across. It was a big field. I\u2019ll never forget the\nAmericans came across with their tanks and infantry. And we were told to stay in the basement\nbecause we didn\u2019t\u2019 know who was going to stay. Who was going to be pushed back. And I know\nthat a, some of the American soldiers got hurt. But do you know that we were afraid to come out\nof the basement for days. We didn\u2019t know if they were going to stay. We didn\u2019t\u2019 know if they\nwere going to be thrown back and but we did get liberated, September 17\" 1944. That was early\nbut still scared. Absolutely frightened to death to even tell people well here I am. I\u2019m Jewish.\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m liberated now. I\u2019m free. For three days we did not come out. We were scared,\nabsolutely scared, scared, scared. Then I gota call or we got a call from Mr. Jansen that my\nparents had gone back to Valkenburg.",
        "A: I was still in the house. They already had gone. Well we didn\u2019t have a place to go. We\ndid not have anywhere because the house that was rented was not ours. We didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: What were our feelings. Oh god. You have no idea. I could have kissed every soldier that\nthere was. I you know",
        "A: First Americans. First Americans that I\u2019ve , that Isaw. And",
        "A: I don\u2019t even, I don\u2019t\u2019 even know that I told them that I was Jewish. I just was so, so\nhappy to be free, afraid. Don\u2019t forget how long have I been afraid. How long have I been in\nunderground. How long have I been living with people, scared For 24 hours all these months.\nThere was not a wink that I could say I could smile. I could enjoy, I could live. It was will I ever\nbe able to be free. Will I ever be able to live. It was I don\u2019t know. I guess I lived so intimidated\nthat I was scared. And to be free. There were so many questions. What happened to my family.\nOh god. What happened to my family. Ok. Mr. Jansen came and got me and brought me to my\nparents. Well we didn\u2019t\u2019 know where we were going to live we didn\u2019t\u2019 \u2014",
        "A: Back in Valkenburg. There was a Jewish family that \u2014",
        "A: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t, didn\u2019t recognize my mother. My mother did not eat. She could not stand the\nthought of pork, bacon. She couldn\u2019t stand the smell in the house. She wouldn\u2019t eat. My mother\nweight about 80 some pounds when she came out of hiding. And she was absolutely what shall I\nsay, devastated. Here we are. but she knew that my brother had left. Her two sisters had left.\nAnother sister with a husband and son had left. And she didn\u2019t know what happened to them.\nShe wouldn\u2019t eat. She just existed. And well my father, he, he was a different type of person.\nThey spoke with the family that owned this big house. And they asked my parents to move in\nwith them. That\u2019s funny. We did not have a chair to sit on. We did not have a bed to sleep on but\nwhat the Dutch government did, they went into the apartments that the Germans deserted, that\nthe Germans left behind and gave us furniture and beds and chairs to sit on and beds to sleep in.\nAnd they gave us enough that we could live in this house. This young couple also was in hiding\nbut the elder couple, the elderly couple had been taken away. Of course they never returned and\nlet me tell you something, how people take things different than others. One day and I\u2019m coming\nback to the people that we lived with. I went upstairs in an attic to hang up clothing. Here this\nyoung man who asked us to come and move in with them tried to hang himself. He tried to\ncommit suicide because his parents did not return and he had an absolute nervous breakdown.\nWell we didn\u2019t have a telephone in our house. I went to the doctor and he was committed for a\nwhile because he had a complete nervous breakdown. Anyway we stayed in this house. Let me\nthink. We lived in this house. We didn\u2019t have any windows in the house. The windows were all\nbroken from the bombs and there were all put together with wood. Let me think. Can you turn it\noff.",
        "A: All right, the transports were coming in. And",
        "A: I\u2019m living with my parents and the transports were coming in and my father still hoped\nthat my mother was alive. He would stand at the",
        "A: At the train station all day long. From morning til night and when he found out\neventually he thought that my brother would never come home. My mother and I would go into\ntown to Maastricht where she was born and where my family used to live and we would go,\nmaybe we would go shopping. Or we would do something. And people would come and say\naren\u2019t you the sister of the Dahl Miss basements. And she said they looked so much alike. And\nlet me tell you it killed her. My mother died literally of heartbreak because her older son, her\nonly son was killed in a concentration camp. Her two maiden aunts, sisters were killed. Her other\nsister and the husband and son were killed. My whole Dutch family is not there anymore. I\u2019m the\nonly survivor of my Dutch family. There is nobody left. The only ones that are left are at the\ncemetery. And my mother is buried in Maastricht. And my grandparents and my great\ngrandparents. But I am the only survivor. I didn\u2019t want to stay in Holland. I felt that as a Jewish\ngirl I didn\u2019t\u2019 have much of a chance. Even so, I had been begged to stay. They needed young\ngirls to marry Jewish men so there would be a continuation of the Jewish people in Holland. And\nI said no I\u2019m not going to do that. I am, my sister lived here and she was willing to send papers\nfor me to come to America. I don\u2019t know one, sometimes I ask myself did I do the right thing to\nleave my parents. But having been through so much in my young life that I felt that I wanted to\nstart a new life. Not really realizing how hard it is to start a new life. Because you turn a leaf\nover and you start all over again. I left my parents. And I came to America.",
        "A: Literally on the boat. I came over on the New Amsterdam. And as soon as I got off the\nboat, the first word my sister said to me is speak only English. No other language 1s spoken in\nour house.",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. I have it all written down. 1948.",
        "A: In the spring. And they she picked, she and my brother in law picked me up and we went\nto Kittaning Pennsylvania which is about 40 miles out of Pittsburgh. That\u2019s where they ended\nup and I don\u2019t know how and why but that\u2019s it. I stayed with them for six months to learn the\nAmerican way of life. I remember that their friends were absolutely wonderful to me. They, I\nspent time with them. They taught me the American way. They invited me to the country club.\nThey had brothers that took me out on a date. It was absolutely wonderful frightening\nexperience for me being in this country. I spoke English pretty well because we were liberated\nby the Americans and I went to, we went to services with the American soldiers. And",
        "A: Yes the Jewish soldiers came to our synagogue and brought, and they had their rabbi that\nbrought everything. And then they came to our house for tea afterwards and this is how I learned\nto speak. Well I spoke English but I learned to speak much better. But anyway one day my\nsister said after having been there for six months, it\u2019s about time for you to go and get a job. So I\ntook the bus into Pittsburgh and I applied, went to some stores. Department stores, ready to wear\nstores and the first time I didn\u2019t\u2019 get anything. Well a couple weeks later you know there\u2019s a\nslow season in August. Things pick up in September. I went back in and I got a job. I got a job\nat Max Asens that was a store that only sold furs, coats and suits. And here this gentleman gave\nme a job. I was scared to death because really I hadn\u2019t done much sewing for a long, long time.\nBut I had to have a place to stay.",
        "A: I just stayed home with them.",
        "A: No",
        "A: And now I have my first job. And well I had to have a place to stay. Well my sister\u2019s\nfriend had an aunt in Pittsburgh who lived, had an apartment over a restaurant and she was\nwilling to take me in. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have a room by myself. I had, I lived, I shared a bedroom with\nher. And I shared the apartment with her and it was difficult. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have really the freedom\nthat I wanted but I couldn\u2019t\u2019 afford more. And she was happy to have me because she used this\nmoney to send, help send her son to law school. It was hard. it was hard, but then again I had\nhelp. My sister\u2019s friends sent somebody, sent young ladies over to pick me up and take me to\nHadassah meetings. And this way I was introduced to Hadassah and a Jewish way of life. And\nknow that there was a ride. And I wanted to take in everything. I went to the Y. I went\nswimming at the Y. I and through the Hadassah I made friends. I made girlfriends and it was\nhard. I was by myself. And I had to live on $25 a week. I had to pay room and board and I had to\neat and I had to dress myself. But I did it. I was very poor. I remember sometimes if I didn\u2019t\u2019\nhave any money I ate M&Ms for dinner. And I remember I got paid on Monday morning and I\nwould go into town just enough money to pay the car fare and I probably had a penny left. But\nthat was fine. I mean I got used to that. I didn\u2019t\u2019 want anything from anybody. I supported\nmyself.",
        "A: Yes. Absolutely. But my mother got very sick. And my mother died. That left my dad\nby himself. There was nobody that could take care of him except my aunt Lisian from London.\nShe also was a widow but she had gone to London with her son. She did not live through the\nHolocaust. My Aunt Lisian came and stayed with my father. And took care of him. And but\nshe also had to leave with her son, daughter in law and granddaughter to emigrate to Israel. So\nDad was alone. But in the meantime the papers were ready and my sister and brother in law and\nagain the family from his family from Brooklyn gave him the papers to come to America. And\ndad moved in with my sister. I was still working and living in Pittsburgh when let me think now.\nI can you turn off.",
        "A: I started to take, I wanted to take everything in when I came to Pittsburgh. I went I saved\nenough money to go and see the Icecapades by myself. I took the cheapest ticket and I know that\nI was, I had the ticket that I couldn\u2019t\u2019 see anything so I walked around. I stood all evening. I\nwanted to make up for all the years that I lost. I took myself to the theater by myself. I went, I\nsat in peanut heaven. All the way in the back just enough to see the shows that I had missed. I\nwanted to make up for all the time and my girlfriends say to me you go out on a Saturday night\nby yourself. If I don\u2019t\u2019 have a date on Saturday night I don\u2019t\u2019 even answer the phone. I said this\ndoesn\u2019t make any difference to me. I want to go and make up and see everything and do\neverything that I\u2019ve never been able to do. I didn\u2019t care if I had a date. I didn\u2019t care if I, I just\nwanted to see everything. But anyway here I was at the Y and everybody played bridge. My\nsister played bridge. They all played bridge and lo and behold I was going to take bridge lessons\nat the Y. Signed up and here there are all of these young single men taking bridge lessons with\nme. Paul Beder wanted to date me and he said to Bernie I\u2019m going to date this girl and Bernie\nsays no I\u2019m going to date this girl. I want her telephone number. So Bernie introduced Paul\nBeder to somebody else who eventually got married. And we started to date. I met Bernie\nplaying bridge at the Y. Date, not hyphen, on and off. Well there was a national Hadassah\nconvention in town and every eligible single woman, single men from all around Pittsburgh area,\nOhio, came to this Hadassah convention. It was a very snowy night and my girlfriend and I we\ntook a cab down to the William Penn Hotel. Get up to the top floor wherever this big thing was.\nAnd we walk around and walk around. And who do I run into but Bernie. We stayed together\nall night and he took me home. That night. And from then on that\u2019s when we started to date.",
        "A: When I got married.",

        "A: We stayed in Pittsburgh. Oh we got married in 1951. Then Bernie decided in April, after\nApril that he wanted to go back to school for his advanced degree. And we went through that.",
        "A: Chemistry. And we moved here in 19, well that was 51. And what did I say. We got\nmarried in 51. And we moved here in 1957. So we stayed six years in Pittsburgh. It took him a\nwhile to get his advanced degree.",
        "A: Yes, I have three, the most wonderful, wonderful daughters. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\nThey are my support. Between my husband and my three daughters, I have the most wonderful\nsupport that I need. Carla is the oldest one. And she was born in Pittsburgh. Helen already was\nborn here in Alexandria and then Eve also. They are absolutely so dear to me that I wouldn\u2019t\u2019\nknow what to do without them, because we don\u2019t\u2019 have family. My sister who, who let me come\nover. She died at the age of 53 of cancer. Her husband was so dependent on her. He had nobody\neither. Because his family was also killed that he died within a year and left their daughter an\norphan at the age of 19. I do have my niece but that\u2019s another story.",
        "A: Father came over wait a minute. When we got married.",
        "A: He did come to the wedding. So he came over before we were married but he lived with\nmy sister. And after we got married, he lived six months with us and six months with my sister.\nWell then we rented a house here in Alexandria and he loved it. But after we moved into this\nhouse, he said I\u2019m not going back so he stayed with us at least ten years. So and he loved it here.\nHe loved the children. He loved my husband. He was a happy person. He went to shul all the\ntime. And when they needed a minyan they came and picked him up. They made him an\nhonorary member of the synagogue and he died when, he got ill. He had heart failure. And he\ndied at the age of 93.",
        "A: Is it off.",
        "A: The war has influenced me to the point that I am the person that said you should not hate\nGermans. You should forgive and forget. Well I am of the opposite end. When I hear somebody\nspeak German, I get such fury in me, I cannot take it. Even so on my own side, my dad I had to\nspeak German to. I have cousins in Brazil that when I write to them I have to think in German. I\nwrite to them in German because their mother tongue now is Portuguese. My mother tongue 1s\nEnglish. Yes, they speak English but not well enough to write letters. So when I write to my\ncousins in and we are in constant contact, I have to write in German. I want to forget Germany.\nI want to forget the German language. I want to forget the German country because it ruined, it\nhas destroyed everything I had. There are some members of my family that are in very close\ncontact with us but I am one of the youngest ones alive. And when we are gone, our whole big\nfamily is no more. But my feelings about Germany. I have, I have friends now, people that I\nwent to school with that want to be friends with me. They invite me to come and visit. They want\nme to stay at their house. I don\u2019t know if I have",
        "A: Non Jewish Germans that I correspond with. Because they insisted I correspond with\nthem. I don\u2019t, I would like to go back and the only reason that I would go back for would be to\nvisit the graves. The graves of my grandparents in Geilenkirchen. I have grandparents, I think\ngreat grandparents probably over there. and the grave of my mother in Holland. With my\ngrandparents and great grandparents in Holland. And I know when mother died that they had had\nthe names of my brother and my aunts and family put in. So no I have no feeling for Germany.\nAbsolutely not. Germany has ruined my, not my life. I have a beautiful life now. But as a child,\nmy childhood, my education. The whole family, there is no more family.",
        "A: No hasn\u2019t changed. I am proud of being a Jew. I will do anything for the Jewish people,\nfor the Jewish religion. I am born, I am raised in that and that\u2019s what I die with. No I am\nperfectly happy to be a Jew and what it means to be a Jew, if I have to fight for it, I will fight for\nit and, and if I, I will always be a Jew.",
        "A: Sometimes yes.",
        "A: With schools. I shared it with I was asked to share it with schools.",
        "A: Not really, I haven\u2019t sat down with them. I really need to do that. They need to know.\nthey know my background.",
        "A: No. I do not get a red cent from Germany because I never worked in Germany. I never\nhad a job in Germany. And no I do not get one red cent.",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 think I can ever forget what happened to me. Why me? why was I, why did it\nhappen to me. Why couldn\u2019t I lead a normal life? Why couldn\u2019t my family lead a normal life?\nLike everybody else. We had a very large warm family of the Dahl family and we still very\nmuch in contact with each other. We correspond with each other because we want to be still the\nfamily that we were.",
        "A: I appreciate the support I have from my husband.\n"
