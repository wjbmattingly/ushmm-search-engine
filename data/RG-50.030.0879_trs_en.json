So we only saw\nbones with eyes, like this fish \u2014 from big fish. And the smell of this was so strong,\nthat I couldn\u2019t eat it. My family couldn\u2019t eat it. Went by one day \u2014 the piece of\nbread was good, one day, two days, three day \u2014 took a week, we get used to it, and\nwas good later on. You have no choice. The body got used to it.",
        "Q: So when you arrived, you were put in these barracks. What did they look like?",
        "A: The barracks look new. There was enough wood to \u2014 to be warm, which\nsometimes is not so good, because when it\u2019s very cold outside, it\u2019s even colder,\nbecause when you warm, you go out in this when you\u2019re warm \u2014 if you\u2019re a little\ncooler, it\u2019s not so cold.",

I remember one day I couldn\u2019t go to work. Was so cold, I\ncouldn\u2019t work. I said to myself, this time I\u2019m not going to go to work. So I went out,\nI had to go to the toilet, whatever, it was outside. And he saw me, Dolgapolof(ph)\nand he told me to come over, so I went over to him. He says to me, why don\u2019t you\nwork? I said, I wa\u2014 I\u2019m very cold, and I\u2019m 15 years old, and the law says about 15\nyears old, I don\u2019t have to work. What\u2019s your name?

        "Q: Were people \u2014 did anybody die from hunger?",
        "A: This is a good question. Nobody died, only one old man died. But if you would\nstay there a little longer, it started up already, because we sold everything from us,\nwhich we have. There was always a black market somehow. And they sold, you\nknow, we had pants, nice pants, so we made different pants and this and that. My\nfather knew how to [indecipherable] with this. But we didn\u2019t have nothing to sell\nany more. And not only we, but everybody. If would stay another year, there would\nbe a lot of casualties, a lot.",

And my\nfather had to prepare himself for a lot of things. He had a bottle of vodka, not\nbecause he wanted to drink, because if some kind of infection comes over, he said\nto him, we need this for these things. So he wanted just a bottle of vodka to the guy,\nthe officer. My father said no. Not giving you nothing. Anyway, they took us to this\nplace, and the officer went to a bigger officer and told him that he has a bottle of\nvodka, he doesn\u2019t want to give it over. So, he came, he looked at us, this father with\nthree sons, and maybe he was Jewish, the officer. He said, leave him alone. My\nfather saw this, he still needed some \u2014 something to buy from drugstore, whatever\nMay 22, 2016\nthat it is. So he asks the officer, can I go out? I'll leave mine sons here, to buy what\nI need still. You can go. They let him out. He knew he is gonna come back.

I went to the market, and I, with\nthe ara \u2014 Arab woman, she was sitting \u2014 not only one, I mean, there was a lot of\nthem. Everything was black market. And I made the price with her for the bread,\n175 rubles, and I give her this 175 rubles, and she gives me the bread. A man beside\nme, standing in the back, I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] as soon as I had the bread\nin my hands, he jumped and grabbed the bread from me, run around the bazaar, and\nMay 22, 2016\nswallow it and then stay still and [indecipherable] me something. Everybody was\nlaughing. What shall I do? Back to the same thing. But I said to myself, I won\u2019t be\nable to hold on a year. I have to go on the black market also. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m\ngonna do for the black market. First of all, I got all kinds of diseases. Had malaria,\ndysentery, everything you can think about it, I had.

It was seven or eight rubles, and I said, I want to buy something to eat,\nsomething. I go and take out my money, the money was not there, somebody took\nout already from my pocket, the money. And I went this \u2014 that time to this place,\nand they disappeared, and I went on black market, and I saw boys older than me,\nwhat they doing, how they doing. Then the black market, they buy, let\u2019s say, 300\nmatches. They make packages of 10, sold three for so much, three for so much,\nthree for so much on the black market, you know. And matches, you know, very\nMay 22, 2016\nfew people had matches, they could \u2014 there was no fire or [indecipherable]. So you\nhad to know how to sell the matches. If you took a match, you took it to the hair, it\ndried out, then you show them that it works. I learned this, and I tried to be, little by\nlittle, I was watching in so other boys like this, but ol-older. One was 45, one was\n35. The youngest was 30. And I am here \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 seventeen. I was like a schlepper, but I was learning a lot of things. And little\nby little, 1f I couldn\u2019t sell something, I ba \u2014 I went to exchange for apple, for this,\nwhatever it is, to survive. My surviving was only because I knew my mother and\ntwo sisters, I have to help them, I have to reach them. And every night I had to plan\na different plan, how will I tell them? What shall I tell them how \u2014 what happened?\nThis was my whole thing. And I learned a lot of this \u2014 one day I saw people sewing\nshoes \u2014 was not shoes, was slippers, because the Arabs, they went in slippers. To fix\nup slippers, you put in a piece, and two needles, and you fix it. I learned this too, by\nmyself, watching.",

They took money, counting money, and they would put together\nsomehow that they counted twice, and there was only once, to change it on there. I\ncouldn\u2019t do these things, I couldn\u2019t do it. But I just looked how to, and I learned. I\nsaid, if I fix your sandals, just give me food, I don\u2019t want no money, no money, no\nmoney. And little by little, I found out how to go through.",
        "A: And one day on the big market \u2014 was once a week, it was a pla \u2014 it was the old \u2014\nthe old city, was thousands of people, thousands coming from the mountains, from\neverywhere, you know. And I had tea for sale everything. And somebody was\nholding me in the side there, I had put away, cause you couldn\u2019t hold everything, in\ncase something [inaudible]. And all of a sudden everybody\u2019s moving away from\nme.",
        "A: Yeah. What is people moving away from me? I didn\u2019t know what happened.\nWhy is people \u2014 I said to myself, what\u2019s going on here? And I turn around.

        "A: Little things. See, she knew I cannot exist. She was just \u2014 but if she would taken\n\u2014 and I was very surprised that she didn\u2019t take me in, because there was so many\nwitnesses.
