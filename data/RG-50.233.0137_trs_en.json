        "Q: The date is April 2, 1992. We\u2019re speaking with Jack Trompettor Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nMr. Trompettor, could you please tell me you name at the time of the war, your date of birth and\nyour place of birth and anything you possibly can about your family background and you\nchildhood?",
        "A: Well my Hebrew name is Isaac, Yitzhak. I was given the name Jack at the time because it was\nnot safe, I suppose, to call children Isaac. I was born in Amsterdam. I was born in a hospital\nwhich, at the time, was taken over by the Germans and used for their Wehrmacht wounded. So\nthere was my mother lying there and having me and because the family name in Trompettor, not\nCohen or Nathanson, it wasn\u2019t evident giveaway that it was a Jewish name.",
        "Q: The date, when was this?",
        "A: This was August 2, 1942. When my mother gave birth to me it was also the same time that my\nfather had been arrested. He was arrested in what\u2019s called a razia which was a raid which was\nwhat the Germans at that point would do in 1942. They would come into a Jewish\nneighborhood, seal off the streets, and then just pick up all the men that they could find and in\nthis case my father was caught and he was taken to Oester Park, East Park which is a park in\nAmsterdam where they held them. And then they transported them, to the Uterperstaad which\nwas where the Gestapo had their central headquarters and it was a school that they took over\nand they had some kind of, I think, gymnasium building, or some gymnasium-like building\nwhere they had all the men lie down, belly, face down and they beat the men on the backs and\non the legs. We, of course found all this out afterwards. My father was arrested. My mother\ndid not know where he was. She gives birth to me. She is understandably terribly, terribly\nanxious and afraid. There was a curfew at this time and no Jews are allowed on the streets at\ncertain hours which made it all very difficult to do shopping and even visiting someone at the\nhospital. But it turned out that my mother\u2019s father, he was a man in his late sixties who wasn\u2019t\nafraid and really didn\u2019t, I suppose, care about this curfew. He was going to see his daughter and\ngrandson.",
        "Q: Did he wear a yellow star on his coat?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know; it\u2019s a good question. He came to visit my mother every day during the\nperiod when my father was -- his whereabouts were unknown. My mother got ill after she gave\nbirth to me. I guess anxiety and everything. She was beside herself. Finally, and I don\u2019t know\nwithin how many days this transpires, I think maybe three or four or five, my father is let go.\nHe calls up his work place. They send a cart which was what you had in Holland then which\nwas to transport goods. You had a bicycle with sort of a cart in front and they put him in the\ncart and they took him home. The reason they did that was because he could barely walk\nbecause he was beaten on his legs. It\u2019s an interesting story how he actually got out. And how\nhe got out was, as he told it, all the captives were lined up. And they had the Gestapo, they had\nthe green police, they had the Dutch police, those Dutch police who were collaborators. They\nhad all levels of police. Everyone wanted to be a brute of some kind. Everyone wanted to get\nin, in some way. The Germans were very, very concerned with TB. They were very, very\nconcerned with that, I guess, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for, plagues or some kind of -- what\u2019s\nthe word I\u2019m looking for -- not a plague.",
        "Q: Contagion.",
        "A: Some contagious disease, thank you. And they had a doctor who was a Jewish doctor look at all\nthe men and ask the men, the captives, questions. Based on these questions the men were let\ngo. And to be let go meant to be kicked in behind and told to get the hell out and never come\nback or whatever. The Germans were so afraid of contagious diseases that their solution to\ncontagious disease was to throw people out. This doctor was someone my father had known.\nIn the twenties my father had some kind of a lung problem and it wasn\u2019t TB. But at the time\nyou carried with you some kind of identity card I think that you with if you had some kind of a\nmedical emergency you could whip it out. So he had a card with him and somehow he had the\ngood sense to have the card out or show it to the doctor and the doctor and German officers are\nstanding at this point in front of my father and the tension is throughout all this very, very\nintense and very high and a lot of questions are being asked and crisscrossed. At the same time\nthe German asks the doctor if this man has TB because of the card. He ends up saying yes. But\nif turns out he\u2019s saying yes to another officer\u2019s demand who is saying, mach shnell, mach\nshnell, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. The level of tension was purposely created by the\nGermans. This is what they did to disempower people, to terrorize them. And it was a tactic; it\nwas a Strategy. It wasn\u2019t simply people losing their temper. It was a strategy of terrifying\npeople. So they\u2019re asking what\u2019s going on, mach shnell, yes. It seems to be misunderstood by\nthe head officer that my father indeed had TB. So they grabbed him, they boot him 1n his\nbehind, they throw him out, lucky him. He gets to a phone, calls up his work place. They send\nover the bicycle and the cart. He comes home to discover he\u2019s had a son. I don\u2019t think he was\nable to visit my mother or myself in the hospital. My mother comes home. Everybody is very\nhappy to have me. I was named Isaac, Yitzhak, he who laughs. The first time I asked my\nparents, when talking with them about the war experiences why they would want to have a child\nduring this time, why they had me. They said it was their blow against Hitler. And I have very\nmixed feelings about this. It makes me a little choked up as it does right now because I feel in\nsome way it casts me in some kind of historical responsibility and there are times where I would\nsay I wish that they didn\u2019t have me then on one hand. On the other hand I\u2019m always grateful\nthat they provided themselves to bring me into the world. That\u2019s the bottom line. So I am the\nblow against Hitler.",
        "Q: That is a responsibility. Can you back up a little and tell me about your family history. Are\nthey long time Dutch Jews or had they come from Germany or .......",
        "A: Yes, my family name Trompettor. There is some dispute whether we are Sephardic which is\nTrompaita or whether we are Ashkenazim from the East. I don\u2019t know. I tend to think we were\nSephardim. The reason for that, actually, is a number of years ago Time Magazine, the New\nYork Times Sunday magazine had an article on Spain. On the cover they had a picture of a\nyoung boy who trained horses and it looks just like me, like I did when I was young. So there\u2019s\na cast to my face that would give that some authenticity. So I think we were Sephardim\nalthough we did not speak Latino in our family nor did we speak Hebrew in our family. My\nparents were working class people. My mother had three brothers. My father had three\nbrothers and three sisters.\nQ They all were from Amsterdam?",
        "A: Yes, we were Amsterdam working class people. Amsterdam by the Dutch was known as\nMokum, M-O-K-U-M, which was a, I don\u2019t know how but it was a Yiddish word for\nAmsterdam and it got into the lexicon. The Dutch refer to Amsterdam often as Mokum. Not\njust the Jews use that term. And the Jews in Holland, I think I\u2019d say you know who came from\nthe East and came from Spain and Holland was very hospitable to them. My parents family,\nmany of them worked in the diamond cutting and polishing industry which was the main\nindustry for the Jews as well as textiles. You had different Jewish neighborhoods in\nAmsterdam. There was one neighborhood called the gold coast which was where the more\nwell-to-do Jewish people would live. Then there was what was the Yodebrastaat which is the\nwide Jewish street which is, I think, also the street where Rembrandt had his tourist home right\nnow. It was a large Jewish community. It\u2019s the southeast of Amsterdam. It\u2019s where many of\nthe Dutch Jews lived.",
        "Q: Do you know where their families lived, your parents\u2019 families?",
        "A: No, I know. Yes my parents\u2019 family lived in the neighborhood of the Yodebrastaat. We lived\nright after the war in the Tunsvalstraat right on the Tunsvalkad which was a canal as Amsterdam\nis crisscrossed by canals. Is there anything else I could say about my parents?",
        "Q: Do you know anything about Jewishly like were they religious, were they observant?",
        "A: Yes, my parents both went to Hebrew school when they were younger. We were not a kosher\nhome. You must understand that the Dutch Jews were mostly working class people and while\nmy parents and their families set a table every Friday night there were no prayers said and I\ndon\u2019t think there were blessings said over the bread or wine with the meal but all the children\nwould be there for that dinner and some with their sweetie pies and after dinner they would all\nleave for their Friday night gallivanting, you know young people. There\u2019s not much talk in my\nfamily of poverty or anything like that even during the depression. There were hard times.\nThere was always food. My father worked in the food trades, in the restaurant trade and always\nhad food, brought home food. So there was always that. And also he was one of the brothers\nwho always seemed to have worked during the hard years. My grandmothers did not work.\nThey were grandmothers which was a job in itself. My mother and father knew each other\nwhen they were in their late teens. And as my mother tells it, she had a crush on my father\nbecause he was so quiet and sweet and I guess, polite. They met each other through my father\u2019s\nsister Maricha, Marie who perished and had become sweethearts very early on and had been\nvery fond of each other and close to each other. It was, I guess, in those days that you paired up\nreal early. But they were engaged for a long time. They didn\u2019t married until they were thirty\nand the reason for that is that they wanted to save money for furniture. And now my mother\ntalks about how she regrets in light of course not knowing about the war that they didn\u2019t get\nmarried sooner and have babies sooner. And I always kind of wondered why they didn\u2019t have\nmore babies and in some ways regret not having children.",
        "Q: Do you know your parents\u2019 dates of birth?",
        "A: Yes, of course. You know at a certain age if you don\u2019t send them a birthday card you have hell\nto pay. My father was born in 1911, May 25\". My mother was born in 1910, June 14\". So\nwe're all summer babies.",
        "Q: So that was the situation leading up to the war. Ha your mother been working, did she have a\ncareer?",
        "A: Yes, she was a seamstress. She talks about having loved her career as a seamstress. In her\nmanuscript which she spent seven years writing she talks about the shop she was in. She talks\nabout the labor struggles. During this time there were many, many labor struggles. My parents\nwere as many Dutch Jews were working class people and by and large they voted for the Social\nDemocratic Party which here we would mistakenly call Socialist or Left. They were a liberal\ndemocratic party whose interests represented working class people. And they also took part of\nthe culture of the Social Democratic Parties and on the first of May, you\u2019d have picnics, you\u2019d\nhave festivals. You would often have camping trips that these parties of the Left provided for\nyoung people which my parents often went to. And your question before about a religious\nhousehold, I do not recall ever having heard my parents talk about a religious household\nalthough there are some times now when I talk to my mother and she disputes that. And I think\nshe may dispute it because there is some matter of pride but I don\u2019t think, and she would know\nbetter than I what happened in those years, but I never heard talk about her religious upbringing.\nI know we never had a kosher home. The first time I stepped into a shul was when I was Bar\nMitzvahed.",
        "Q: Really? So you didn\u2019t go for the High Holidays or anything like that?",
        "A: Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my parents pleaded with my brother and I to go to shul for the\nHigh Holidays and we didn\u2019t. And we compromised. We said well we\u2019ll get dressed and we\u2019ll\nwalk around temple so everyone will see us but we\u2019re not going in because we didn\u2019t know\nHebrew and also being refugees and being survivors we felt in a way alienated from the Jewish\ncommunity about us. And that is something that is very typical of people with our story. In\nsome way we were met with a lot of not understanding. I always have felt very alienated from\nJudaism. I knew when I grew up in Brooklyn there were times where I would be beaten up for\nbeing Jewish. Easter would roll around and the Italian kids, boys, would come from Avenue X\nand we lived on Avenue Z and Avenue Y was a dividing line and you had the Italian people\nliving on Avenue X and the Jewish people living on Avenue Z. And as what was popularly\nknown then Jewish boys did not fight. They did not fight. So Easter would come around and I\nwith my friends would be playing outside and Italian boys would come into the neighborhood\nand they would tell us we killed Christ. And I didn\u2019t know who this boy Christ was, I had no\nidea. And I certainly knew that I and no one had killed anybody recently. So they would attack\nus and beat us up. We didn\u2019t know about fighting back. So that happened a few times. And I\nguess that was one of many punctuation marks in my feeling not Jewish. And for many years I\ndid not in some way come out as being Jewish. I did not come forward with it. I did not\ncultivate my social relationships based on people being Jewish. I had friends from all kinds of\ngroups as I do now.",
        "Q: But meanwhile though your parents had settled in a basically Jewish area?",
        "A: Well, yes, yes. We came to America in 1949, my parents, my brother, who was really my step-\nbrother as I'll go on to tell later, my aunt and uncle and their two daughters. We lived in Far\nRockaway. First few months we had an attic and we all slept on cots in the attic. And then at\nsome point we got an apartment in Rockaway. We got two basement apartments which were\nabout three blocks from the ocean which us kids in the family absolutely loved because it meant\nour summers we had a lot to do and to play. But in the spring when the rains came the\nbasement would always be flooded and we\u2019d always have to buy a new rug. So it was a sort of\nimmigrant story. And then in 1951 when Beachhaven which was one of the first projects that\nFred Trump built (which is the Donald\u2019s father) built in Brooklyn, my parents moved out there.\nIt was a very big step. It really was an attempt for my parents to start to build something for us.\nAt one point they talked about wanting to move to Long Island which was also considered a\nstep up and buy a home there which they never did. I as of late come to understand that there\nwas a subtext to our life which was around the matter of denial and that had to do with getting\non with life and putting all that stuff behind us, just get on with life.",
        "Q: I hate to stop you but could you tell me what happened to your family during the war? We\nstarted with your birth so there are two more years at least.",
        "A: There\u2019s plenty. So I was born on August second. This was the time when people were already\nbeing deported to Vestaburg which was a transit camp in the north of Holland, in the moors,\nGod forsaken nowhere place. From Vestaburg every Tuesday the transport went east. People\nwent either to Auschwitz, to Treblinka, to Sobibor, to Chelmo where most of my grandparents,\naunts and uncles perished. Because our name was Trompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a\nlot of typical Dutch Jewish names my father who belonged to a butcher\u2019s union which was\ntaken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish names would all be crossed off. Trompettor was\nnot crossed off which meant we would continue to get their news letter but this time with the\nNational Socialist masthead on it. So my father would conspicuously leave it on a little side\ntable by the door in case there were raids and people would come in they would see this and\nthink my father was not Jewish. Upstairs though in the same house lived my mother\u2019s parents.\nDuring this time the Jewish Council in Amsterdam as there were in many countries had a list of\nall the people who were in Holland who were Jewish and the list was made available to the\nGermans. And I know there is much argument about the role of the Jewish Council. Because\nmy parents were, I guess, working class people and sympathetic to the left of the political\nspectrum they had a certain kind of savvy about what was happening. In Holland from \u201933 on\nyou had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so stories got around. People got a sense of the\nbrutality that was there. When my father was arrested and beaten up as he tells it, he was of\ncourse among other things shocked. Something like this never happened to him and he felt that\nwith this kind of brutality it was going to get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and\nthat if they were capable of this no one was safe. And that\u2019s what he felt. Before that happened\nthere was the curfew, there were people being taken away, there were street fights in Jewish\nneighborhoods. Dutch fascists would come into the Jewish neighborhoods, the ice-cream\nparlors, the tea houses and start fights and there would be these altercations. But when he was\nbeaten up he understood how bad it was and he decided then he was going to go underground.\nHe was not going to register. My mother\u2019s brother, Shok who is the name I was given, Jack, in\nhonor of him, I think he was a very active Socialist and as my mother tells the story right before\nor after I was born she\u2019s in my parents\u2019 home and my mother\u2019s brother Shok is still living there\nshe enters into his room and sees him with a tallis and he\u2019s praying. And she is shocked\nbecause she\u2019s known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an atheist. My mother says\nwhat\u2019s going on? And he says, well he\u2019s praying so his parents won\u2019t be taken away and has\ndecided that he will go and register in their place. Throughout the early period of the German\noccupations and the subjugation of the Jewish community there were continual regulations that\nwere tended to deceive people. One of them was that if the young people in the family would\nregister, the old people would not be taken. This was of course a way of sabotaging and\nundermining any form of resistance and many, many people believed it. You have to\nunderstand and appreciate that. What some people might see as stupidity or cooperation isn\u2019t\nquite that. It has to be understood in the context of Holland is a country that\u2019s very much\nconcerned with law, with rules, with order. I always feel that they\u2019re kind of caught between\nthe anvil of Calvinism and the hammer of Anarchism and the reason for that is because cities\nlike Amsterdam and Rotterdam are international cities and the Dutch have been for a few\nhundred years an international merchant people. So not to register was considered an illegal act\neven though it was clear to many that those who were in power, who made the law, were evil.\nBut my father decided he was not going to register, he was going to do something else. That\nwas a very big step. It was the first step to resistance. Many people of course had no idea what\nwas going on in the east after the transports. People really believed they were going to be\nsettled in some farm somewhere to dig potatoes and till the soil. But because my father had a\ncertain political savvy he knew what German Fascism meant as people did. So he decided he\nwas not going to register; he was going to go underground. The problem was what does that\nmean? How do you do it? Who do you make contact with? Who do you trust? And it was all\nluck. So my mother\u2019s brother Shok decides he\u2019s going to register to save the grandparents. He\nregisters. He is sent to Vestaborg. At some point from Vestaborg he sends my mother a card,\nmy mother and father a card that says don\u2019t bring the red baby wagon which was their code for\nsaying do not come, do not bring Jackie as I was known because even in Vestaborg which was\nnot as horrible as the camps in the east there was constructed to deceive people. Actually when\nI say this I am stunned at how remarkable the deception was, to be deceived. In some way I\nknow this is in hindsight I get very angry at it. How could people be so stupid? And on the\nother hand how can I say that? And all of it is a, it\u2019s a mix of feelings one has, I have.",
        "Q: I think you pointed it out when you said how the Dutch people were concerned with order and\nall that and they say they came in so fast to Holland and people were in shock and they just\nrounded up and took them out. I don\u2019t think they had time to really think. That was my\nimpression.",
        "A: Yeah, but you know they had people coming in from Germany from 1933 with stories.",
        "Q: True. True.",
        "A: Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation other than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism. He\u2019s the\nultimate form of European bullyism. So my father comes home; Iam born. They decide\nthey\u2019re going to go underground. And one of the terrible things that also happens is that one\nconsiders the older people, the grandparents. What do they do? How do they go underground?\nAnd the family is kind of in some way the younger people start to provide for themselves. This\nis a question my cousins and I have often wondered about. What about the grandparents; what\ndo you do? And I understand it\u2019s a terrible question and it\u2019s one I have asked my mother and\nnever really gotten any kind of a satisfactory answer and I\u2019m a little bit ashamed to even pursue\nit. But I wonder about it. I can tell you one story, terrible story. My father has the newspaper\nwith the National Socialist masthead left at the table. There is a raid one day. The Dutch\npolice, the green police which were the German police come in. They know the people who\nlive upstairs are Jewish. They come to take them away. It turns out to be my mother\u2019s parents\nand it is my mother\u2019s mother\u2019s, my grandmother\u2019s birthday that this happens. And my mother\nof course 1s beside herself in shock, terrible, terrible. You can imagine how terrible something\nlike that is. My father gathers his wits; he goes to the police. He says, we\u2019ve known our\nneighbors for a long time could we please say goodbye to them? The Germans say yes. So\nhere are my parents saying goodbye. My father is saying goodbye to his in-laws, my mother is\nsaying goodbye to her parents as if they were just neighbors. It\u2019s a terrible thing and I often\nwonder what my mother has done with that pain and that grief. She has written it all down. So\nmy mother\u2019s parents are taken away. I don\u2019t know whether at this point before or after my\nfather\u2019s parents are taken away. Some of the brothers and sisters have been taken away, some\nhave not. Those that remain decide to go underground and it means you don\u2019t tell anyone else\nwhere you\u2019re going because it\u2019s unsafe. All you could do 1s tell your parents goodbye. When\npeople went underground at the time they had no idea for how long this would be. No one\nknew. Some people thought weeks, months. No one thought of years. My parents had saved\nsome money so they had money that they knew they would need to provide for their keep while\nthey were underground. They made a connection through someone they knew who knew\nsomeone who knew someone to two people whose names are Cory and Jan Van Nomberg who\nare people who I now know as my aunt and uncle who live in Tilburg who we have been very\nclose to since the war; people who I\u2019m very, very fond of. He was in the Dutch cavalry. He\nwas a sort of, I wouldn\u2019t say monarchist, but he was a very good Dutch patriot. They came\nfrom Tilburg, a Catholic family. Holland is kind of divided like that. The people in the south\nare Catholic, the people in the north are Protestant. They came from a good Catholic family but\nhe hated the Germans. Not that he hated National Socialism but he hated the Germans because\nthey invaded his country. He wanted to do something. My parents ended up with them. At first\nthe story was that my father was on the run; he didn\u2019t want to serve in the army. I don\u2019t know,\nwhat you would call a deserter. So they were taken in by Cory and Jan based on that. But there\nis a sense that Cory and Jan did kind of know that that was not the story, that they might be\nJews. At some point early on in their underground experience it becomes apparent, it\u2019s talked\nabout and Cory and Jan decide well we\u2019ve gone this far with you we\u2019re not going to turn you\naway. And my parents spent from November of 1942 till the liberation in May with these\npeople. I went underground about a week, a few days or a week before they went underground.\nI was three months old when I went underground. You can imagine, if you can imagine what it\nwas like for my mother to give up her child with the hope that she is saving my life with always\nthe knowledge of the possibility I\u2019m being offered up to destruction. We were one of the lucky\nfamilies. We all survived. My parents survived. I survived.",
        "Q: Did they circumsise you?",
        "A: I was circumcised. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand why people would take the chance of\ndoing that, would take the chance because when there were raids the Germans would pull down\nthe pants of the men in the street to see if they were Jewish. Remarkable, remarkable, crude to\nsay the least. Yeah, but you know I guess you circumcise your child to show your fealty. It\u2019s a\npractice that I have real questions about. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve gotten lost in some -- I\u2019m not in a\ntrack.",
        "Q: You went underground. You were sent underground.",
        "A: Yes, I was sent underground. I spent the first night with my mother\u2019s brother\u2019s wife, Ollie, who\nwas a gentile woman, my mother\u2019s brother Morris, his first wife died in childbirth. He marries\nOllie. Ollie is a gentile woman. Ollie has me for one or two nights and my parents know\nnothing of who has me or where I am. The deal is if the family goes underground it\u2019s best to\nseparate the children because at least that will raise the chances of someone surviving. So I go\nwith Ollie and eventually I\u2019m passed on to other people. I spend a short time in a Quaker\nchildren\u2019s home, a very short time. It turns out that when my parents are also underground\nCory, of Cory and Jan who are taking care of my parents, Cory goes to check on me to see how\nIam. This is done without telling my mother. My father knows about it, Jan knows about it. I\ndon\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t tell my mother. They made some assumptions. Cory goes to see\nhow I am doing. She goes to the Quaker home. She\u2019s there. She has a bad feeling about the\nplace. She takes me out of there right away. She spends a night with me in the woods. They\ntalk about that there was fighting or shelling somewhere around there but it\u2019s 1942 so I don\u2019t\nreally understand whether there\u2019s resistance activity or what but this is how it\u2019s talked about.\nShe gets me to another place. I am finally placed in a place called Hino which is about 35\nkilometers from the German border with a very poor Protestant family, people who are in their\nsixties, the family De Chot. Cory comes back which she does. She has the good sense to go to\na place that\u2019s sort of like the equivalent of a Fotomat. She has a picture taken of me that she can\nbring back and show my mother. My mother, in this time, doesn\u2019t know why Cory has been\ngone for so long. Jan and my father know but they get worried. She doesn\u2019t come home until\nvery, very late the next day and she lays it out to my mother. Your boy is safe. We had to take\nhim out of there. They find out subsequently it turns out that the next day this place 1s raided --\nthat children are taken out of there. The adults there are arrested. Remarkable. So Cory has\nthis sense, has her sixth sense.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not all Jewish children there was there or were there many?",
        "A: There were many, many Jewish children. What they would do is they would mix the Jewish\nchildren in with the -- it was like a Quaker orphanage -- with other children. And this was often\nhow it was done when Jewish children were hidden in groups, in France and Belgium and\nHolland. This is how it was done. When the children like myself went underground the parents\nwere told to remember the clothes that the children had on. The people who received the\nchildren like myself were told to save that clothing because it was the only way to identify a\nchild. So the story goes that my mother had a bathing suit that they cut up. Because she was a\nseamstress they made a little pants for me, a little top and a little hat. This is what I was\ndelivered in eventually to the De Chot family and this is what they kept... So what we are all in\nhiding, my parents not knowing whether I\u2019m alive or where Iam. My mother tells the story that\nevery night before she went to sleep she would pray for my well -being. They had cut a lock of\nhair from my head that she had and she would use this as some kind of reliquary, some kind of\ntalisman pray for my hair, pray for me. Every night ask my father when was it going to be over\nwas it going to be all right. And of course what could the poor man do but say yes my dear, of\ncourse. So they were hidden with Cory and Jan from the end of November till May of 1945.\nFor almost three years I was separated from my parents. When I first agreed to do this\ninterview, when I was told about it my first response was well you know there are so many\npeople who are older who have more powerful, more horrible stories to tell, they\u2019re important\nto know. And then I thought but who will tell the story of people like myself who were at this\nage if I don\u2019t. So it was a big step for me to decide to do it because in the community of people\nwho are survivors, people who are camp survivors, people who are underground survivors,\nthere has been a kind of presumptuously established hierarchy of suffering, that those who were\nin the camps suffered the most and they probably did. They did indeed. But it meant that for\nthose of us who didn\u2019t suffer like that we couldn\u2019t really tell our story because it was not as bad\nbecause we had that one potato that we should be happy for. And this has been very\nproblematic. Because of the conference last May this was a subject that was brought up and\ntalked about. And even at the conference I had an instant where I was in an elevator and there\nwas an older woman standing there, a short woman, and she had a little identity card which we\nall had which said our name, what country we were from, where we were hidden and what\nyears. And she\u2019s squinting up and she is Dutch as I can see and I chat with her and she\u2019s\nsquinting up and looking and says oh you were just a baby. And I was very angry with her and I\nthought how can you be so thoughtless at this place. But it is part of the problem. It is the\nproblem who were in camps -- although to feel and I can\u2019t be anything but sympathetic with\nthat but 1t doesn\u2019t allow me to tell my story. And I think this is an issue that has now been\nbrought forth and dealt with as being one of the issues that we all have, that it\u2019s all authentic.",
        "Q: Certainly, by all means. Did the Americans liberate your parents?",
        "A: The British and Canadians. In Holland, I was in the north of Holland, my parents were in the\nsouth of Holland. The south of Holland was liberated some time early of \u201945 and people at the\ntime didn\u2019t know what was going on in the north but in the north you had what was called the\nhunger winter because as the Germans were being defeated and withdrawing they took all the\nfoodstuffs they could lay their hands on and the consequence was that something like 15,000\npeople in northern Holland died of hunger because there wasn\u2019t anything they could put in their\nstomach, remarkable. I lived on a farm. Fortunately there was some food available. I\u2019m told\nthe story that the people who took care of me would share everything they had with me and it\nwas very, very little. When I was finally found I looked like a picture of what we see today of\nstarving children. I had a swelled head, tiny little body, skinny bones. But I had my share of\nwhat other people had. And I guess for my parents to have seen me eventually like this and to\nknow this made it difficult for them. It raised the guilt ante for them; the guilt of having given\nme up even though the intent was to save my life. There were all kinds of complex inter-family\ndynamics come out of this.",
        "Q: How did they ultimately find you?",
        "A: Good story. So my parents are liberated. They\u2019re living in Tilburg. Tilburg turns out to be a\nsort of central command place for the British and Canadian army as well as the place where all\nthe people who survived the camps come, all the Dutch Jews who come back -- all, the few --\nall, whatever twenty of them, come back to Tilburg and there; there\u2019s the Joint Committee of\nvarious Jewish organizations from America that help in finding people, in relocating people. It\nturns out that my father with the liberation gets a job with the British army as some kind of\ncook. He does this temporarily. They ask him to sign up for a year, whatever. He says forget\nit, he\u2019s out of it. As far as he knows he\u2019s the only male survivor of the family. He\u2019s going to\nfind out where the children are. He knows the children are hidden in Holland somewhere. He\u2019s\ngoing to find out where. So as the story goes, he like Charlie Chaplin has a stick on his\nshoulder with a bag at the end of it and because there was not yet any real public transportation\nhe hitchhikes on military vehicles -- goes to this village -- finds out there\u2019s a resistance group\nthere. There were a lot of church people who were instrumental in hiding children; finds this\npastor who turns him on to a priest, who turns him on to a mayor. He finally finds his way to\nknow that there is a young boy who fits my description who\u2019s hidden in Hino in this farm. He\u2019s\nhitchhiking. He appears there. It\u2019s night, it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s a farmhouse. He bangs on the door.\nPeople lean out the top window, what\u2019s going on, who 1s it? He tells the story. My name is\nGerrit Trompettor. I\u2019m looking for a young by described so and so. Would he be here? And\nthere is some pause and finally they say well yes. He comes in but they don\u2019t wake me, it\u2019s late\nat night. He sleeps in a hayloft or somewhere on the farm. In the morning I am brought to him,\nI sit on his lap and I say \u201cpeen in ma book, peen in ma book\u201d which is the Dutch rural\nexpression of \u201cpain in ma bouk\u201d which means pain in my stomach. Gerrit thinks I am talking\nabout a book. The Dutch word for stomach is \u201cbook is \u201cbook\u201d The Dutch word for stomach is\n\u2018\u201cbouk\u201d. Because I\u2019m speaking this flat rural accent he doesn\u2019t understand me. It turns out I\u2019m\ntalking about pain in my stomach. I\u2019m hungry or something. I don\u2019t know at what point he\ncomprehends that he and I are speaking an entirely different language. But it turns out that he\nhas a talk with the family. They find out he is my father, I\u2019m his son and he\u2019s come to take me.\nAnd I\u2019m having trouble right now recalling whether he takes me the first day or whether he\nleaves me there and he goes back and he gets Celene, the mom in this story. And it\u2019s interesting\nthat I\u2019m having trouble recalling that. I don\u2019t know. Anyway I am reunited with my family. I\nam undernourished. I am sickly. I am brought to a doctor who informs my parents that with\nfood and care in a short while Ill be back to normal, I\u2019ll be fine.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve absolutely no recollection of any of this, is that correct?",
        "A: No, I also find it very distressing that I have no recollection. But I\u2019m between the ages of three\nmonths and two years. Now I know there are stories of people who remember some things two,\nthree years. I have two recollections. One of them is that I am in a home, I am picked up and\nvery quickly brought to a second floor and I am put in a closet. In the closet is a hobby- horse.\nAnd I sit on the hobby- horse for a while and I hear voices downstairs and then later I\u2019m\nbrought downstairs again. I don\u2019t know whether this is a dream or a memory. That\u2019s all I really\nremember. And as I said it distresses me because I really have a need to know and understand\nmore about this period. In our family as it happened in many families after the war when there\nwere hidden parents and hidden children the main story in the family was that the parents were\nhidden and survived the war. And then there happened to be the story that the children were\nhidden and survived the war. But we were very young; we had no story to tell. So our story\nkind of fell into the background. And in those years, right after the war and even in the fifties\nand sixties there wasn\u2019t any understanding or talk or research or literature or anything on what it\nwas like for children who had to be reunited with the parents. I often talk about that I was\nadopted by my parents in 1945 because here I am a three year old kid who talks a different\nlanguage. It took my parents a while, my parents and I to understand each other. And here I am\nthinking, I suppose, that I\u2019ve been taken away from my parents by this new couple who tell me\nthey\u2019re my parents and there\u2019s the program and I have to get with the program. I have to love\nthem as they love me and it caused a great deal of problems. It still does.",
        "Q: You think that was really one of the main tensions?",
        "A: Well it has been, I have come to understand it as one of the main tensions. I have, I realize now,\nbeen a depressed man for many, many years. I have been an angry man as well and unable to\ncommit myself to many things. And I now understand what all that is about. I mean there are\npsychological dimensions to all of this that I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re important to speak\nabout whether this is pure quote unquote history or -- there are people who to this day suffer\nbecause of what happened to them during the war. There are others like myself who have\nproblems because of what happened right after the war because denial was the order of the day.\nAnd it meant that those of us who are younger could not delve into our story. I have always\nwhen I was a young man living with my parents asked them about the war, terrifically curious,\nas Iam now. And there was a way of finding my own voice and my own story. But when it\ncame to asking questions about the people I was with, what happened to them, what was it like,\nI always came up against some form of denial, always, always. In 1985, I think it was the year,\nit was the year before my father died, I was visiting my parents who since 1972 moved back to\nHolland. I was determined to find out more about my history and about these people, the De\nChot family. And I told them, I said I\u2019m going to find out about this. Id like you to help me.\nIf you don\u2019t, fine but I\u2019m going to do it anyway. Well my parents must have conferred that\nevening and reached a wise decision and said well we\u2019ll go with you. Let\u2019s make a day of it.\nSo the next day we drive to this area of Holland and we go to a City Hall of a town nearby to\nfind maps, names of people. We don\u2019t find much but we drive around and we drive to where\nmy father thinks the farm was. Well it turns out it\u2019s a major highway right now. There\u2019s\nnothing there -- it\u2019s obliterated but we do pass through what\u2019s the other town where my\nbrother/cousin was hidden and he was like fifteen kilometers from me and nobody knew. But\nwe saw the house that he was hidden in and we recognized it because we had a photo that was\nmade right after the war and it showed the same wrought iron fence, a very beautiful intricate\ndesign and it was immediately clear. My brother who was really my first cousin was taken care\nof by a woman, Mrs. De Fries, a very fine woman, a religious woman who had a hard time\ngiving him up. But after the war my parents stayed in close contact with her and in the early\nfifties she came and spent part of a summer vacation with us. My parents in some ways were\nvery wise. They knew that the separation between us and our foster parents would be\nproblematic and in some way no matter what people did out of the best of intentions there\nwould be problems. And I realize this now. I see a therapist twice a week which is enormously\nhelpful. It\u2019s paid for by the Dutch government. And I talk about all this stuff and I never talked\nabout this before and I\u2019ve come to some understandings and one of the things I\u2019ve come to\nunderstand is that we were given up for hiding with the best of intentions -- out of nothing but\nlove and care. But it still caused us problems. And it\u2019s I feel a terrible dilemma for my parents\nthat out of the best of intentions we were damned if we did and we were damned if we didn\u2019t\nand we have this to deal with and it makes me, I was going to use the word angry, the truth 1s I\nam outraged and livid that I should now have to deal with this stuff in my lifetime that I\u2019m a\nman who has a hard time relaxing, who does not feel safe and secure in the world, I\u2019m so angry\nat that and to be gifted with life but to be born at a terrible time.",
        "Q: Do you want to tell me a little bit about how your cousin came to live with you?",
        "A: My cousin Andy\u2019s parents were Cheel, Macheel and his mother Maricha, Marie. They went\nunderground but they were caught and they perished in -- I call him my brother Andy, it\u2019s a\nhabit. My brother\u2019s father which is not my father perished a few weeks before the liberation.\nHe was shot on one of the marches from Auschwitz. My mother, his mother perished in \u00b044. I\nhave an album here, of course you can\u2019t see it on tape, that a distant relative in Holland made\nfor us where it\u2019s a genealogical tracing of the family and in it we have listings of people and\nunder the listing where it says when they died, where they died we have, well here it says\nHolocaust to say that he perished -- Judah Zomerplak some of my mother\u2019s family. People\nperished in Treblinka; they perished in Auschwitz, they perished in Sobibor. So my brother\u2019s\nparents perished, his mother in the camp. The adults at the time they were deciding to go\nunderground made this agreement, that whoever survived would take in the children who, God\nwilling, survived. It turned out that my brother, Andy was taken in by my parents.",
        "Q: How did they find him?",
        "A: How did they find him? They found him -- my father found me, my brother, my cousin Sylvia,\nmy cousin Yanaka. Just by tracing he found us all, quite remarkable. He found us and I always\nremember knowing that Andy was my brother. What did I know from first cousin. Some time I\nthink when he was ten or eleven years old in America my parents sat us down and told us the\nstory of his parents. And I remember -- I don\u2019t know how my brother took it in. I have no idea\nhow he took it in. I remember going to bed at night and crying and feeling very sorry for Andy.\nMy father came in the room and said to me, just because he\u2019s your cousin doesn\u2019t mean we love\nhim less than you which I suppose it\u2019s the transverse saying it doesn\u2019t mean we love you less\nthan him. And at the time I felt very, very sad. And I always in my heart felt very sad about my\nbrother. I now have come to understand it was myself I was feeling sad for, that I was feeling\nsad for not knowing my foster parents.",
        "Q: You were the same age basically?",
        "A: Yeah we were three months different. He was three months older. He died in 1979. He hada\nmassive heart attack. He, I feel very strongly, was a man who was plagued by what happened\nduring the war. When he knew his parents perished and he was adopted and he never, I think\nmetabolized any of that stuff. Unfortunately after the war the advice that my parents and many\npeople like them was given was one of --oh you\u2019ll love your children, you feed them, you take\ncare and everything will be okay. No one knew any different. No one knew that there was a\npsychological dimension that would come up. I think my brother stewed on this stuff for a very\nlong time. He was a ferocious smoker, nervous habit. He became a puppeteer. He had a\npuppet theater and he traveled all over the country and he settled in Tulsa Oklahoma. He was\nmarried for a while. That didn\u2019t work out. He was a hard person. I say hard in terms of\ntexture. He lived his life very hard and he was very troubled by it all and unfortunately we\ndidn\u2019t have the advantage of having some kind of therapy or having the right kind of attention\nthat we do now and I always feel bad that Andy died prematurely and that the war reached out\nand took him. When he died I had the task of calling up my parents late at night who lived in\nEurope to tell them about it. And I vowed to myself at that time that I would take care of\nmyself so that I would never have to have someone call my parents up and tell them what\nhappened. It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. Every time someone in my family dies, I feel\nit\u2019s not a matter of people passing on as nature designed it but all the memories of our losses\nand our feeling betrayed comes back. It\u2019s not just someone dying, it\u2019s the war again. And I\ndon\u2019t know how other people like myself experience that. This is my experience.",
        "Q: What did your parents do then immediately after they got the kids together?",
        "A: We moved to Amsterdam. My father got work and even when my parents were hidden\nunderground they talked about they decided they were going to go to America and they were\ngoing to teach each other English which they did. They taught each other a bit of English.\nCory and Jan learned a little English. They were going to America. My family and Cory and\nJan, the people who hid them, stayed very close after the war. There are always ironies in\nhistory and one of the ironies is that, for our family, it\u2019s been a privilege and a delight to have\nhad these new people in our lives, Cory and Jan, who I\u2019ve always called Tanta Cory and Omi\nJan aunt and uncle and whom I\u2019m in touch with and very close to. When I go to Holland I see\nthem. And when I got married in 1982 they came with my parents here so that was fun. So we\nwere all very close after the war. My father went back into the restaurant business. He worked\nfor a woman whose name was De Haas who had a number of restaurants and he was her main\nmanager. She was in the camps. She survived the camps. She opened up a restaurant again. It\nwas on the Centeur Bahn in Amsterdam which was a well known shopping street. The\nrestaurant was a well- known place. But while he was working there after the war he still had\non his mind he was going to America and they did that because we have relatives here. We had\nwhat you would call a matriarch aunt, Rose, Rose Blitz Gossler who in 1945 right after the war\ncame to Holland ro see who was left who she could help. At the time there was a conversation\nbetween her and my father that when he would come to America she would help him set up in\nthe Deli business which never transpired, which became a little chicken bone 1n the throat for a\nfew years. So we had family here who sponsored us. You needed to have a sponsor, someone\nwho could swear that you would not become a ward of the state. So we sailed here on the New\nAmsterdam and came here on August 12, 1949 and I remember coming and my Aunt Rose was\nthere to greet us with some other relatives who I don\u2019t recall. And she mentioned something to\nme in English that I should run up to this guard, this police officer and say -- and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was and I went over and blabbed it to him and he smiled and that was it. So my first\nwords in English were a mystery to me except for the police officer. My parents very quickly\nstarted to make a life for themselves here, determined to put everything behind us. And, of\ncourse, my parents are people who have had a history before the war. They\u2019ve had a history\nthat they think of fondly and speak of fondly. So the war was an interruption, a terrible\ninterruption. For the rest of us who were younger it was our first experience in the world. We\nhad nothing to go back to, to draw from, to support us. So it was different for my parents. They\nwere able to say, let\u2019s build a life. Those of us who were younger had some real traumatic\nproblems. I understand that some -- we were in some way victims of child abuse. We were\ntraumatized children. I know from my cousin that one of my cousins had a very difficult time\nin going back with her Mom and Dad. She wanted to be back with her foster parents.",
        "Q: How old was she?",
        "A: She is two years older than me so at the time she was five. And there was an incident where I\nguess she got to be so whiny and nagging and impossible that her mother filled the suitcase, put\nit on the front steps and said, go. Get with the program or go. And the rest of us got the\nmessage; it was a very serious message. So we all got with the program. You know it\u2019s a\ncomplex thing. You wished that your parents were smarter, were wiser but they were who they\nwere and they tried their very best.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel estrangement this whole time in a sense?",
        "A: No, I never felt estranged from my parents. The odd thing is my parents did very well by me.\nAnd I think of them very fondly; I miss my father terribly. I\u2019m sorry my mother\u2019s living in\nHolland and we can\u2019t be closer. But I know that I grew up as a very angry person. Right after\nthe war I was hospitalized. I was hospitalized. Let\u2019s see now, three months after the liberation I\nwas hospitalized for three months. I had I guess what you called chorea or what\u2019s commonly\ncalled St. Vitus Dance, I had a nervous disorder. So clearly I was paying for it. I remember\nbeing very well taken care of in the hospital. It was a Catholic hospital and I remember the\nnuns. I remember like you see on the TV program the nuns with the giant wings on their heads,\nreal nun, old world nun. I remember being very well taken care of and then when we came to\nAmerica, a few weeks after we were here my father had a serious stomach operation, ulcer. A\nfew months again I also had a nervous breakdown. So there was stuff going on. There\u2019s the\nwill to survive and get along with it and then there\u2019s the body telling you I can\u2019t take anymore.\nThere\u2019s the psyche telling you I can\u2019t take anymore. I need down time; I need time off. So I\nremember my parents doing very well by me. I\u2019m not someone who complains about my\nparents. But I also know that I grew up as a very angry young man with a terribly sarcastic\nsense of humor; always saw the dark side of things first; was very politically active in the\nsixties in the civil rights and war stuff and even in the seventies. My anger was coming from\nmy experiences as a child. I know that when I was born my mother was not able to really take\ncare of me well because she was just a wreck. People around me were a wreck filled with fear\nand dread and I must have taken that in as they say with your mother\u2019s milk even though there\nwas no mother\u2019s milk. I had taken that all in and I experienced myself as a very anxious\nperson.",
        "Q: Now when you moved to the Brighton Beach area were there primarily other refugees in your\nneighborhood or was there-------?",
        "A: I remember only one family. It was a Hungarian family with two boys and I heard from my\nparents that they were in the war too. But there was never any talk with those families about\nthat. We played with their children. But if there were other refugee families I didn\u2019t know\nabout it. People didn\u2019t talk about it to each other. You put it behind you. You deny it; you get\non with your life. And I think now there was also a certain element of shame about it all among\nother feelings. It was like people were in the closet with their stuff. And I grew up in Beach\nHaven. I have enjoyable memories of my childhood also being a nervous kid but not a very\nintense religious quality to our family\u2019s life. We would have Passover. We would set a nice\ntable and have a wonderful meal. There was nothing said. We would celebrate Christmas. We\nhad a lot of intermarriage family which you have with Jewish families in Europe, a lot of\nintermarriage.",
        "Q: Who did your parents associate with once they came here?",
        "A: They associated with their family. There was my father\u2019s brother Morritz survived Auschwitz\nand Mauthausen. These two brothers took care of each other; they survived. They paid a\nterrible price for it. They died, one of heart, one of cancer. They associated with family. They\ndidn\u2019t make friends. It was something I always found very peculiar. I suppose in Holland it\nwas that way too. There was a large family before the war; your family were your friends. My\nmother who now lives in Amsterdam in Beth Sholom which is a kind of quasi retirement home\nhas a very nice circle of about four or five women her age who have similar stories who they\u2019re\nvery close with. It\u2019s very sweet. After dinner they sit in each other\u2019s small apartments and\ntheyll watch TV and have coffee and chat. And then when it\u2019s time to go to bed they\u2019 Il kiss\neach other goodnight and they\u2019Il go to their separate homes, rooms. And it\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s not\nsomething that she had as a younger woman here. Her friends were always the other -- sister-\nin-laws. She had sister-in-law friends.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s typical of the European rather than------but I was wondering since they came\nout\u2014",
        "A: My mother did make friends with the women in her shop. She worked in the garment trade for\nmany years, mostly Italian women. And she learned to cook very good Italian food from that\nand she speaks of it very fondly. She says the post-war years were some of the best years of her\nlife; I saw the boys grow up. We had a good time. She remembers it very fondly.",
        "Q: So you never had any formal Jewish education of any sort?",
        "A: No, I was, it\u2019s an interesting story I\u2019m glad you asked. A few months, about two or three\nmonths before it was time to have my brother and I bar mitzvahed we had a local rabbi come to\nthe house and give us rabbi lessons. And at one point, it was a very rote kind of lesson, we had\nto \u201czocher\u201d we had to remember but we didn\u2019t have to understand. So at one point we said,\nrabbi what does this mean? And he said, it doesn\u2019t matter you don\u2019t need to know, just\nremember. And I can date my alienation from Judaism from that day, from that moment. A\nvery unwise thing to say. There might have been an agenda that was just get the boys to\nremember it. Nonetheless it\u2019s not an answer I would give if I were a rabbi that\u2019s for sure. So I\nwas not a Jewish person until a few years ago when my wife took an interest in Judaism; had us\njoin a local shul because she wisely understood it was part of the process of me being\ndisaffected. At first we would go to shul just for the high holiday. I\u2019d sit in the back with my\ncoat and hat on ready to flee at any time feeling very uncomfortable always feeling like I want\nto cry. I would go to shul and feel like I want to cry. And that\u2019s the way I feel right now even\nsaying it, not feeling welcome, not feeling safe. I understand now it\u2019s not feeling safe. For us\nto identify with Judaism was to immediately putting ourselves in touch with everything that was\ndangerous to us. And I at some point regretted very much that not only had those bastards taken\nour families they now had taken our culture. And I was determined to take that culture back\nwithin the context of being a 49 year old man living in Cambridge in the latter half of the\ntwentieth century swept left and right by secular humanism, being a little bit politically leftist\nand sympathetic and liberal and feeling strongly about certain issues. Within that context I take\nback my Jewish culture.",
        "Q: I think there\u2019s a lot of space for it actually.",
        "A: There is a lot of space for it. The only problem 1s we just realized we joined a rather\nconservative temple where the whole service 1s like a Polish steeplechase, you know. I\u2019m still\nreading the commentary and they\u2019re finished. So I\u2019m sort of shopping around for a little more\ncontemporary enlightened shul. Our godson who lives in North Hampton was going to be bar\nmitzvahed and I was going to be called up to read for the first time and decided well I\u2019d better\ndo this really well not to embarrass him nor myself. So Lucy and I, my wife Lucy and I a year\nbefore started taking Hebrew lessons just so we could read this. I could read this short little\nthing and took Hebrew lessons for about two and a half years so I could read Torah and know\nwhat was being said. And that kind of got us started and every Friday night Lucy and I have\nShabbat dinner and we do a blessing and when we\u2019re not too exhausted from the end of the\nweek we\u2019ll read something and have found it very important to have something that separates\nthe work week from rest, to have a moment of grace, to allow ourselves some grace even\nthough the next day, Saturday, we\u2019re still doing things we have to do. There are times where I\nfeel I\u2019d like to go to shul even though I\u2019Il sit there. I won\u2019t know what\u2019s being talked about but\nI'll sit there; P\u2019Il read the commentary. There\u2019ll be a Kiddush and I enjoy that. It\u2019s hard to lead\na Jewish life because all the issues for me. I find it very difficult.",
        "Q: When did you get involved with this... you just got involved with the survivor\u2019s group after\nthey had the Children\u2019s Conference?",
        "A: Yeah, the Children\u2019s Conference was the week of May 5\" 1991 and we knew about it almost a\nyear before and I thought at the time I didn\u2019t want to go to this conference. I didn\u2019t want to deal\nwith any of this stuff. And then I had started going to therapy shortly before the conference and\ntalking to my therapist about it to help me to understand that it was probably a good thing to do.\nAnd I talked with my cousins who were determined to go and I said well I'll come down to\nNew York and meet you. We can have lunch and see each other but I\u2019m not going to the\nconference. So we talked and talked and eventually I understood that it was a good thing for\nme to do. I went to the conference and it was terrific. I also sort of count for my conscious\ndepression to that time and know that my whole life I\u2019ve been depressed. But it\u2019s all very much\nopen and on the surface right now and I give it a name. It\u2019s peculiar because there are times\nwhen people will see me and they\u2019 Il say, hi Jack how are you. And the question while only a\nsecond long feels like a thousand light years which gives me enough time to think do I tell them\nhow I\u2019m really doing, do I be sociable, do I know this person well enough? Because I don\u2019t\nfeel I\u2019m doing well, you know but understand it\u2019s a social question but now there are people\nwho know my situation. I was at a dinner a month ago with some old friends and half the\npeople there were therapists. And at some point this old friend who hadn\u2019t seen me in a while\nactually a friend of my wife said, so Jack so how are you? Are you doing any good art work,\nany art, what\u2019s happening. I said, well actually I see my therapist twice a week I\u2019m very\ndepressed, the bottom of the art market has fallen and there\u2019s not much happening, and you?\nAnd there\u2019s dead silence and it\u2019s sort of like a Woody Allen scene.",
        "Q: I guess they didn\u2019t invite you anymore, huh?",
        "A: No, they invited my wife back to the chorus. It\u2019s in Brookline. There\u2019s a Brookline chorus.",
        "Q: I was just kidding.",
        "A: I know but you know it was important for me to say it, to give an answer not to sidestep it\nbecause for people like myself who were younger during the war the matter of having a voice is\ncrucial. And the matter of being able to feel our experience was authentic 1s crucial.",
        "Q: I think the truth of it there are so few children, Jewish children, who survived the war, so few --\nand then were reunited with their family or something like that. There are others who were just\nbroken at that point.",
        "A: I think that the numbers something like 25,000 people went underground and something like\n16,000 perished were betrayed being underground. The statistics are so telling. In Holland\nbefore the war you had including 25,000 Jewish German refugees you had 140,000 Jews in\nHolland. After the war you had something between 15 and 10 or 25,000, terrible attrition rate.\nIt makes me feel very badly about Europe. In the 1960\u2019s I traveled a lot to Europe. I would\nwork here for a while. \u2019'd save my money. I\u2019d go live in Europe; I\u2019'd bum around. Those were\nthe years you could do that and see Europe and I was not that aware of my feelings of all of this\nstuff but as time goes by I find myself very angry about Europe.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you about your Dutch identity. What did your parents do when you got here?\nDid you sort of sublimate? Did you speak Dutch at home or have Dutch customs?",
        "A: We spoke both at home. I am very good with languages. I lost my accent very quickly. What\u2019s\namusing is that in being with this group of hidden children who meets -- we meet once a month\n-- 1am one of the few people who doesn\u2019t have an accent and what I enjoy is being with these\npeople because this is a circle of people I would have been in had things been better, been\ndifferent. So it gives me a sense of what it was like for my parents, for my family and I enjoy\nit. So we came here and I went to school and I had -- I want to say hello to Mrs. Harris who in\nthe third grade was so wonderful to me. She helped me to learn English. We spoke Dutch and\nEnglish at home but of course we started to speak more English. And I went back to Holland\nfor the first time in 1965 as did my parents although we went on separate trips -- we met in\nHolland but we went on our separate trips. And I ended up living in Holland for a year in 1965\nbecause I wanted to learn Dutch again. You know I studied French in school and I like\nlanguages and I wanted to do that. But as to the matter of Dutch identity it\u2019s very complex for\nme because being a European American I like that I have -- whatever it means to be a European\nJew I like that because it gives me a certain perspective about what it means to live in America\nin this time in history. On the other hand I find some of the presumptuousness and arrogance of\nthe Europeans about America really shallow and I\u2019ve always sort of understood America is the\nEuropean peasant\u2019s dream come true. And the only difference between America and Europe is\nmaybe a hundred years. But the more I\u2019m in touch with what I feel about my experiences the\nless happy I am with Europe. I feel we have been wretchedly betrayed.",
        "Q: Your parents never gave you that sense. Do you think they felt that too?",
        "A: My parents never -- we never talked about 1n such a national context of saying Europe betrayed\nus. It was Germany, it was Hitler, 1t was Dutch collaborators. But you can take any country in\nEurope and it happened. What I also find interesting is that what the European Christian\ncommunity is something that the Europeans have been doing to people of color all over the\nworld for a few hundred years. What the Germans did in southwest Africa, what the Dutch did\nin Indonesia and what the Belgians did in the Congo, what the English did and what the French\ndid they did it to everybody else who was different. And when it happened in their own\nhomeland all of a sudden it became a terrible dark enigma about Hitler and Hitlerism and I\nreally do attribute it -- the little that I know about history -- that it was a European phenomenon\nand the groundwork was laid by the church, by the Christian church. And I mean people have\nto own up to that, they have to own up to that.",
        "Q: Can I ask you about your art? Do you feel that in any way your art manifests some of your\n9",
        "A: Well actually it does in so far as that my art has nothing to do with my experience. My art is a\ncomplete denial of my experience and it is such an enigma to me. My artistic voice does not in\nany way include my experience and I see that as a function of denial. It perplexes me. And\nsometimes, you know some morning II] wake up and say boy I wish I could really express all\nthat stuff in my art. But then I think of oh well but then I would be so literal, literal or pedantic\nor rhetorical and I don\u2019t want to be that. It\u2019s not what I draw on for my art. My art what I draw\non is from my beauty, my love of beauty, the love of what\u2019s beautiful in the world, the love of\nwhat\u2019s beautiful between people. I also think there are aesthetic problems with dealing with\nhorrors of such magnitude and I\u2019m not the person to do it so I leave it alone.",
        "Q: Have you looked at any other so-called Holocaust artists?",
        "A: Yes, well I have looked -- there\u2019s a book of art from Auschwitz, things that were painted on\nwalls and I\u2019m absolutely struck by how powerful it is. It\u2019s different than people today who will\nmake art that\u2019s about that. It does not strike a chord in me. I also in some way -- Elie Wiesel\ntalks somehow about that you can\u2019t make art out of it, how in some way it\u2019s so inexplicable that\nall art will fall short and I think even successful Holocaust Shoah art falls short. To maintain a\ncertain kind of integrity 1t would have to, it would have to. And I always felt for myself that art\nis about redemption and I don\u2019t think......",
        "Q: It\u2019s very idealistic.\nA; No, it\u2019s not idealistic. It\u2019s as I think that the way in which the creative process functions in each\nof us. You draw on aspirations, you draw on hope, you draw on a sense of all things in their\nconnectedness rather than being dispert. And you look for the sacred, what\u2019s sacred in life.\nThis is I think what motivates art and other people of course have another sense of it. And for\nnow the Shoah is I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a place for redemption right now. I mean I understand\nthat in our group that we meet once a month we have been talking about among other things\nabout how civilization has a need to deny and has a need to forget. It\u2019s a shameful period and it\nneeds to forget and it will do this in many ways. One way will be the most banal expression of\npeople who absolutely deny it happened. Then there is the matter of having perpetrators and\nvictims be seen as equivocal in some way sort of like the Blitburg visit. We\u2019re all victims of\nwar. Well that\u2019s so but that\u2019s beside this point and that over time who knows how the story of\nthis thing will be told. We can witness the experience of the African Americans in this country,\nthe horror of that and how that\u2019s already been glossed over. And I think that civilizations have a\nneed to forget their shame and this is why I insist upon telling my story and say yes to being\ninterviewed to anyone who\u2019s willing to listen.",
        "Q: Can I ask you some more questions maybe about your parents, about their personalities? If\nwe're going to include them in our project I would need to..... I think I\u2019ll switch the tape\nthough. We\u2019re on the second tape of the interview with Jack Trompettor. We\u2019re talking about\nhis parents now. Which parent would you like to start with?",
        "A: Well I can tell you some things about them relative to the war experiences that are interesting in\nterms of personality. One is that my mother talks of having found my father so very appealing\nwhen they were younger because he was a quiet fellow and she liked that about him. It turns\nout that during the war he went through this personality change and he became a gregarious\nchatty chap. He\u2019s a man who loved to talk to strangers as I am and he was very sociable, he\nwas fun, he was easy to get along with. So he went through a real personality change. My\nmother is more of a worrier. She does the worrying for us and it\u2019s sort of an unfair\nresponsibility I think. It\u2019s enough to be a mother but then to have to do the worrying. And she -\n- well it\u2019s hard to really talk about her without defaming her.",
        "Q: Other people have had this experience too.",
        "A: Yes. Well you know we accept our mothers and fathers as gods and forget that they are\nbeautifully human. What can I say about my parents? I don\u2019t really know except that I know in\nAmerica my father worked very hard. I'd see him come home and after dinner he\u2019d sit on a\nstool in front of the TV and within five minutes he was asleep, he was out. On Sundays he\nwould go with the other men in the family and sometimes some of the boys. then we would go\nwatch the soccer games. All the ethnic clubs in New York City played soccer with each other\nand we\u2019d do that. And they belonged to the Holland-American sporting club which would have\na New Year\u2019s party. Which would have functions, events. So they kept within their Dutch\ncircle. Any friends that they made outside of the family were still Dutchmen. In some ways I\nregret that they did not branch out more.",
        "Q: It sounds to me that like for example your father must have been extremely strong-willed to\nhave made the decision not to register and things like that.",
        "A: Yes, you know I experienced my father as a very ordinary person and I don\u2019t mean that\n\u201cordinaire\u201d. I mean just -- he was just a person. But he 1s very creative in life. In the short haul\nhe\u2019s very creative. When a crisis would come up he would be real quick and he would be really\non the case and I know when he and my mother went underground my mother did most of the\nhemming and hawing of course. I say of course, I don\u2019t know. And he had to really convince\nher as well as her brother\u2019s letter that said don\u2019t bring the red baby carriage -- had to convince\nher they had to do it. So she would do a lot of hemming and hawing but she\u2019s a very expressive\nperson. My mother is the one who I\u2019ve done much of my talking with. We are both connected\nvery emotionally in that way. It\u2019s been troublesome as well because of that. My father P\u2019ve\nexperienced a little more distantly. Guess it\u2019s very typical in that way. I always experienced\nthem both as being very supportive but there are things I never really got into with my father\nthat I would get into with my mother. My mother would have wonderful provocative arguments\nand she was the more expressively emotional one.",
        "Q: I know its hard having observed your parents, interacting with other people. Do you know how\nthey were generally thought of?",
        "A: My parents in the family have had a good reputation, very good reputation. When I talk with\nmy cousins and they talked about my parents they always talked about how friendly and sweet\nand thoughtful they were. And this is how I\u2019ve experienced them, as a thoughtful people who\nwere very practical at life and also had placed a premium on being a decent person. There was\na clear message about you had to be an ethical person.",
        "Q: And they behaved that way as well, it seems?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything else maybe that you know about their childhoods or their youth or their ...?\nYou say they were involved in these social democratic -- was that a teenageerhood already or?",
        "A: Yeah, sixteen, seventeen on. You know you\u2019re in a particular class and your social life at that\ntime was very much involved in political groups, the young people\u2019s socialist league or\nsomething like that. And what it meant was it provided a social life with a kind of minimal\npolitical context for young people and sometimes it would serve the purpose of grooming more\nseriously politically committed people. But it was also neighborhood stuff, it was\nneighborhood stuff. My parents lived with a lot of relatives as did many people then and they\nenjoyed that . They did a lot of their playing and socializing with those cousins.",
        "Q: Did they have any hobbies or music interests or anything like that?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see now, no, I know that during the war my father got involved in marquetry, wood\nmarquetry. During the thirties in Europe it was very popular. You\u2019d get marquetry sets. Like\nlet\u2019s say here its Scrabble or hula-hoop which dates me. But there it was marquetry and during\nthe war Jan Van Nomberg and my father managed to get hold of these marquetry sets and make\nthese little pictures. They were copies of famous old masters and my mother has my dad\u2019s. It\u2019s\nin my dowry. I get 1t when it\u2019s my turn and it\u2019s a replication of a famous Vermeer painting of the\nhouse where Vermeer lived and it\u2019s remarkable because the brick is all these small pieces of\nwood and the mortar in between are all these tiny, tiny little splints of pieces of wood. They did\nthis during the war when they were underground to keep themselves from going cuckoo. I\ndon\u2019t know of any other habit, hobbies my father had. My mother liked to sing when she was\nyounger. I know I grew up loving opera and I attribute that to her. These people worked a lot.\nThe message here was work, work so.... And I am an artist and that\u2019s my work and other people\nwould consider that a hobby so what other people would consider a hobby I took on as a major -\n- aS an occupation.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your own experience or that of your\nfamily, your relatives.",
        "A: Well at the expense of sounding whiny, I would say that my family like many, many people got\nscrewed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and my parents had to start from scratch again\nand never could quite build it up to where they had in Holland. They worked very hard in\nHolland and they did well for themselves. And I do marvel actually at my parents the ability to\ngo into hiding, provide for themselves and survive. When I was in my teens and going through\nmy rebellion I pooh-poohed my parents. What did they know? I knew much more than they\ndid. And now, of course, I think what a little snot-nose I was to think that. They had to live\nthrough and make life decisions through something I have not had to and hope to God I and no\none else will ever have to make. And they were ordinary people, simple people and they rose to\nthe occasion and the people that hid them were ordinary human beings and they rose to the\noccasion. Those were the heroes. My parents were the heroes. The people that hid them were\nthe heroes. And the stories they tell of what they did during the war to survive 1s remarkable.\nMy mother taught Cory how to sew. What they did -- they would get clothing and they would\ntake it apart and remake things out of it and they would sell or exchange that for foodstuffs.\nAnd when my parents were hidden underground no one on the street in the town, of course,\nknew they were being hidden. The parents of Cory knew but not her younger brother. It was\ntoo dangerous to let people know. And Jan would get food. He had those wide pants at the\ntime, very wide flair pants, very popular then, like bell-bottoms in some way and they sewed\nthese cloth bags to the inside of their pants that they would fill with foodstuffs and he would\nbicycle home with them. They also had to be careful because they couldn\u2019t trade for food that\nwould be evident that there was more than two people in the household eating so it had to be all\ndone in different places and as my mother tells it they were never hungry during the war. They\nalways had enough foodstuffs. And she would take great pleasure going down to the cellar and\nlooking at the shelves and seeing what food they were able to store.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: It is interesting. I know I lived on a farm from 1977 to 1980. Actually I did farming in New\nEngland from 1973 to 1980 when I lived with someone and we raised, we had a milk cow, we\nraised hogs, we raised chickens, we raised sheep, we raised a lot of our own foodstuffs. And I\nwould go down to the cellar and I would put up forty quarts of applesauce, sixty quarts of\ntomatoes, freezer filled with meat, freezer filled with vegetables, cords of wood stacked up --\nvery New England. And I would go look at all this and stand there like a proud man with my\nhand in my suspenders looking at it and not at the time understanding what was going on was\nsome kind of replication of some need that my parents went through. My parents went back to\nHolland in 1972 because they wanted to retire and they could do it there rather than here and it\nwas also the year that I went to live in Vermont during the summer and ended up staying there\nand ended up actually having left New York City and shortly after ended up in a farm situation\nand I do wonder now how I[ had replicated my war experiences. In a way it makes me feel very\nbad that my agenda was so unconscious that my going into this farm and farming was a matter\nof going into hiding. I had a big beard, I had long hair, I looked very different than I do now. I\nwas in hiding and it makes m feel very badly that I still had to act this out and it happened at the\nsame time as my parents decided to go back to Europe and again it was a kind of a split with my\nfamily, a separation. I understand it now.",
        "Q: What motivated them to actually -- you said because they could retire there now. Have you\ndecided to continue this interview after all?",
        "A: Yes. I want to read this little piece, that is what my wife and I translated from my mother\u2019s\njournal that she spent seven years writing about her and the family\u2019s wartime experience. And\nwhat\u2019s interesting is she has said that in writing this it made her feel much better. She\u2019s really\nthe only one in her family that even talks about this stuff. For years my brother and I even after\nwe moved out of our parents\u2019 home when we\u2019d come home to visit would ask them about the\nwar. And inevitably every time we got together the conversation would come back to that and\nthere were questions. My brother and I always had to ask questions. At one point we finally\ndecided let\u2019s get Mom a tape recorder and see if she\u2019d really do this. And she did. And she\nspent seven years writing this stuff down. And it was done without a typewriter, without a\npersonal computer, just by hand. And she got so involved with it that when Cory wanted to go\nout with her shopping or something Celene wouldn\u2019t go. She really wanted to do this and\ncomplete it and as I said she felt in a way that a burden was taken off her chest. There\u2019s one\nlittle piece I want to read that could give you an idea of what it was like at the time that my\nparents made the decision to go underground and to provide and look for a place for me. On the\nfifteenth of November Eddie (which was my mother\u2019s other brother) visited us with great\nsadness because of what had happened to Father, Mother and our brother Jack. During this visit\nhe told us he had an underground address for Dad and myself and a separate one for you, Jack.\nIt\u2019s written for you because this whole manuscript was written for my brother and myself. So\nthat\u2019s the form it takes. Very distressed with the idea of parting from our baby, Eddie tried to\nconvince us that your chances, Jack were better without us. If we were captured he explained at\nleast you might survive. He also knew it would be easier to find a separate place for a couple\nwithout children. They would not bring to the underground family the additional burden and\nsecurity risk of children crying or needing medical attention and such. All night Eddie talked\nwith us. What an extraordinary demand -- give up our three month old child to perfect strangers\nand without opportunities to visit. We had no idea how long such an arrangement would have\nto last, a month, half a year, longer, who knew. The next day we talked with my brother Maritz.\nIn the serious way that\u2019s so typical of him he asked Dad and me to consider the following\n: Imagine the German police catching you, he said, this could happen at any moment. The\nbaby will fall into their hands. Wouldn\u2019t you rather have a child with Ollie and me (Ollie was\nhis wife) until Eddie takes them to a hiding place? Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he\nsaid. Here was a chance so many people wanted but had no opportunity of getting. How could\nwe pass it up. We felt that no matter what we did we would be doomed if we didn\u2019t do\nanything. Already the families of several of our brothers and sisters had been torn apart by\narrests and deportations. A few months ago, Case, the husband of Dad\u2019s sister, Bepe, had been\ntaken to Camp Westerbork leaving Bepe at home alone with their two year- old daughter.\nWesterbork was located in Northern Holland and the Jews were sent from there to the different\nconcentration camps, Auschwitz, Sobibor. Maritz Trompettor, who was my father\u2019s brother,\nhad been in the same camp for half a year by then. His wife, Femma and their daughters were\nstill at home. The children\u2019s home in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the\nGreen Police. They captured the Jewish infants and sent them with their mothers to be gassed\nor destroyed in one way or another. But Femma protected herself and her daughters and then\nfound underground addresses for each of them. This is my Aunt Femma who died a year ago.\nShe was very active in finding hiding places for children. She was a very brave and very strong\nand feisty woman. The thing is many people were brave and feisty and strong and everything\nbut in some way it was luck. It was luck that you survived but it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that\nyou were lucky or that being lucky meant you were better than anyone else. My brother Maritz\nand his family were still intact and living at the Transvaalstraat. My mother\u2019s brother Maritz\nwas born in England because his parents took a trip to England and he was born there so he had\ndual citizenship. He had British and Dutch citizenship. He eventually ended up in Bergen-\nBelsen but Belsen was not an extermination camp and because he was a British citizen they\ndidn\u2019t kill him. It also allowed for his wife Ollie to bring food packages to him which helped\nhim to survive. Eddie, another brother, because he was involved with the resistance moved\naround from one temporary hiding place to another. He never went permanently underground.\nIndeed with his pure blue eyes and curly blond hair he thought he would be taken for a German\nrather than a Dutch Jew. Brazen as he was he had been riding trains filled with Germans and\nthese experiences gave him this idea. Of course he did not know that in time he would be the\nvictim of betrayal. He was betrayed. My close friend Marie which is my brother\u2019s/cousin\u2019s\nmother which is Andy\u2019s mother, another of Dad\u2019s sisters was still at home with her husband,\nCheel and their six month old infant Andy. Like us they lived with all the worries and fears of\nkeeping Andy out of the hands of the pack of thieves. By now Dad\u2019s other sister, Judith, her\nhusband and their four year old daughter Laney had been underground for three months. With\ngreat difficulty and sadness we struggled over our decision to go into hiding. There was not\neven a guarantee that all would go well underground. Inasmuch as no guarantee was to be\nfound with any choice we made we finally decided to go ahead with Eddie\u2019s plan. He promised\nthat within a week we would be told all the details. This was the best of the worst of situations.\nMaritz\u2019s wife Ollie also had to agree with the arrangement because she would be also\nresponsible for caring for our son, me. No one knew for how long. It could take two days, it\ncould take a month. But Ollie agreed without talking to us. It was good enough for her that my\nbrothers wanted it. We have always been grateful to her. Ollie died two and a half months ago\nand I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a letter saying something like this about what a\ndecent person she was and how we owe our thanks to her and I wrote this letter as -- 1t was\nostensibly a condolence letter but I wanted to say something to her daughters about what a fine\nperson she was. We cared a great deal for our family. Sisters, brothers and children were heavy\non our hearts and particularly the old people. What did one do with the old people. Grandma\nand Grandfather Trompettor were still living at home. They were fortunate for the moment\nbecause Shuls, one of their sons, one of my father\u2019s brothers, and his family lived nearby\nallowing them to help his parents through thick and thin. But with his loving attention to them\nand his recent service period away from home (he had to serve in the army) he hadn\u2019t been able\nto find an underground address. The old people understood that for them life was finished. One\nsees this now on the photographs taken of them for their identity papers. Even if they went\nunderground, which seldom happened, their chance for survival was very slim. As long as the\nwar continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves, most\nlikely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved. Often enough there was talk of\nthe underground and so with great grief they began to live with it (meaning the children going\nunderground). Thus was something we simply could not continue to think about. If one\nbecame too sensitive and afraid then one might let an opportunity go by. We grew resolute. We\ndid not tell anyone about our plan other than Father and Mother Trompettor. You, Jack and I\nhad recently visited them and I did not expect them to say goodbye to us again. From their\ngestures at our departure I saw that for them it was a real goodbye, not just a good-day until the\nnext time. Clearly they suspected something. Every evening for years Dad visited them for a\nfew minutes. Now he went to tell them of our decision. How does one present such a sad\nprospect. Like their other children we too kept the details for ourselves for the sake of security.\nYou took nobody into your confidence. This was what the bad society had made of us. Later as\nit turned out all those who were still at home except for Uncles Jules eventually went\nunderground but it consoled us little to learn that we were not the only ones who had to leave\nparents. This is a very telling piece which always perplexes me. For me the leaving was not so\ndifficult because my parents were not here anymore. This is my mother talking because her\nparents were already taken away. What I have left if they were still at home. Dad asked\nhimself this question. No good answer was found. Today, forty years later, I do not think I\nwould have made this choice again. The twentieth of November 1942 arrives. It is early in the\nmorning and I am home alone when Eddie comes to our apartment. We must be ready before\neight o\u2019clock that night, he says, to begin with the first part of our journey into hiding. As we\nhad originally agreed he himself--------- (let\u2019s see if I can find the other piece of that). Eddie\nhimself would bring us. Everything was planned that way. Jackie, that\u2019s me, would be picked\nup by my brother Maritz at seven o\u2019clock in the evening and from thereon a place would be\nfound in the children\u2019s house in Neimachen. This was just as Eddie said it would happen from\nthe agreed upon plans made earlier on. We were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the\nchildren\u2019s house. We did just this even though in this time this amount of money was a large\namount for working class people. It was organized so that we would have a particular amount\nwith us and Eddie would hold on to the rest. In case something went wrong with us there\nwould still be enough money for a definite time to pay the kinder house. In the beginning we\ncould know if we had enough money or not for the duration of the war. We naively thought it\nwould be possible. As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver Kike the\nneighbor and I delivered our household goods to her apartment with the help of her husband.\nThis is a neighbor who was very friendly with my parents who agreed to buy their furniture so\nmy parents could raise money and they knew what was going on. When you went underground\nand you left you couldn\u2019t leave abruptly because then immediately someone would be on your\ntail so my parents planned this over time so they could slowly leave.. They would leave\nsomeone paying some of their bills and it would be months before it was realized that they were\ngone. And my mother has often talked about how she felt she had to be like a criminal. She\nhad to think like a criminal because the law was in the hands of the criminals. She as an\nordinary person had to think like that to survive. Dad was quickly warned at work I do not\nknow by whom. At four o\u2019clock he came home which was very unusual for Thursday when he\nusually came home about eight o\u2019clock or later. He just told his boss he had to go away for a\nlittle while. Because it was so busy on Thursdays this boss told him to be quick and come back\nas soon as possible but Dad knew better. He then went for the last time to his mother and father\nwho were in a dejected mood and not without reason. They had just before found out that their\ndaughter Judith, her husband and child, Yope and Laney were betrayed and handed over to the\nGermans. We will never know if the Trompettor grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still\nwith her benefactor having gotten away from her executioners. This is my cousin Laney who\nlives in Holland. I\u2019m almost absolutely certain they did not know otherwise we would have\nheard it from Uncle Jules. For Dad at the moment while this was indeed a grim message he\ntried not to be disheartened. On the contrary this news of his sister strengthened him in his\nresolve to go into hiding. In answer to your question about their character. You never really\nknow the full depth I suppose of your character until something extraordinarily intervenes and\nthen if you\u2019re lucky you rise to the occasion. Dad also told his parents what we were going to\ndo that night but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them. This was the\nlast time that Dad was ever again to be with his parents. Here was the new episode between\nparents and children finished under the saddest of circumstances. Still to come were many\nmore moments of separation. Dad came home and told me that what he had just learned from\nhis parents about his sister and her family. I felt very sad but now realized that we had come\nthis far and we definitely had to continue with our plans, the sooner the better. And this of\ncourse then is my mother\u2019s moment when she too becomes resolute. We ate something and got\ndressed as if we were going out. We put on our best clothing because you never knew. Seven\no\u2019clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brother Maritz came to take Jackie away. What\na moment. Would we ever see you again? We embraced you; it had to be. It was for us to say\nthe least the only chance. We had to try but how do you do something like that. Who gives you\nthe strength to hand over your three month old child a bundle that you love so much and have\nlearned every gesture in those three months. When we gave you to Uncle Maritz Zomerplaag\nwe knew there would be a place prepared for you in the Catholic children\u2019s home. Later as it\nturned out we found out it was a non-denominational. It was a Quaker house where the director\ntook in various children but mostly those in Catholic families. My brother Eddie found that he\nmade more of an impression on us when he said it was a children\u2019s home. I surmised this at the\ntime. It did indeed make a better impression on us. Eddie said that it would still take a few\ndays before there would be a permanent place for you there. Later we learned that those few\ndays turned into a month but it was a good thing that we didn\u2019t know that at the time. In those\nfour weeks of waiting you were almost a fatality. I will return to this later. (This is where I\ntalked about that). It\u2019s remarkable to me. It helps to explain what I feel about my anxiety and\ninsecurity in the world that as a baby I took in all this near destruction of stuff and from what\nwe know now about children take in the world. It was our wish to survive this drama with Jack\nback with us. Therefore it was necessary to arrive at our destination safely. This wish was for\nus so strong and so consumed us that it became for us the strength needed to give you over to\nfulfill this unbelievable and horribly sad task. Without exaggeration from that moment on we\nthought about you every day. I would like to read a little bit more. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a......",
        "Q: We have more tape.",
        "A: Okay. I read this to give you a sense possibly of what it was like for my parents and for me and\nwhat people lived with. Now we were again alone without you.. What torment. Do not think\nthat it is easy to write about this now. To imagine that so many parents had to go through the\nsame and even worse including Marie Cheel. When they had to take you, Andy, with the best of\nintentions of getting you back. Where your parents brought you we did not know. This was\nlogical since we were already underground. Later I will write about some of the details, our\ndear departed son. My mother finished this -- was writing the story at the time my brother died\nso it changes-- what do we call that the transitive.....?",
        "Q: The tense.",
        "A: The tense, the transitive chicken, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: With regard to him?",
        "A: Yes, yes. As soon as Maritz took Jackie out of the house we too went on our way to the Umstel\ntrain station just as we had planned. This took ten minutes. We closed the door on the largest\npart of our household\u2019s possessions and most of our clothing. Obviously they must not have\nhad their yellow star on because they could not have been out. In the meantime Dad had left a\nhalf-year\u2019s rent money behind with our landlord. The landlord knew we were going away but\nnot when. If this helped us we don\u2019t know. It did give us the idea that we would say the lease\nnot be looked at for six months although certainly not out of dispute with the landlord although\nbetrayal or discovery was always naturally a possibility. In any case later on we heard of the\nfirst raid of our apartment and that it was sealed up by the Germans. Thus we were not searched\nfor in the first raid. From this we conclude that paying the landlord that way we did serve our\npurposes well. I would like to read about when my father found me. I feel I need to have my\nvoice back again. That\u2019s the problem with this. My brother and I were instrumental in getting\nmy mother to do this and it means a lot to me and I\u2019m very pleased she did it but in reading it, it\nalso pushes my button about what about me -- now. Dad felt it was now time for him to begin\nhis own search for you. We are reading now about the part where my parents have been\nliberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look for whatever children are still\nalive. We had no idea how to do it. We had no guidance but our patience was up and we could\nnot wait for information that would inform us about what happened with you and Andy.\nBecause of the behavior of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any\naction making known that during the war-time they had hidden a child. Many people like them\nwere attached to the children in their care, very understandable. The family De Chot presumed\nthat Dad and I were no longer alive. We now know that in our situation regarding you that you\nwould have then been returned to us. What happened during the war too is people did get\nattached to their children and there were many legal cases in Holland after the war where the\nfamilies who survived had to go to court to get the children back. The nature of some of these\ncases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was\nthrough the black market. There was no doubt about it, that\u2019s how you survived. My mother\nfeels embarrassed about it. She thinks it\u2019s shameful. She prefers I not saying anything about it\nbut the fact is that\u2019s how people survived. Gentile families who did not want to return their\nJewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible\nparents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back\nbecause of that. Many of the people who hid the children also had a religious agenda. They felt\nthey needed to convert these children and it wasn\u2019t always a self-serving sentiment. It was also\nthe sentiment of how to save the children. To convert them would be to save them, so it was\nmixed. The reason there was a high percentage of Dutch Jewish children who were able to go\nunderground was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah. The\nJews were known as the people of the Book and for many of the Protestants in Holland they\ntook their bible literally, it\u2019s interesting. With Andy it would have turned out differently\nbecause his parents were no longer alive. More about that later. Dad didn\u2019t want to wait any\nmore while the information just dribbled in and as I said went out on his own. After enquiring\nhe found out where to go to the military authorities and get a special pass that allowed him to\nhitch rides on military transport. There was no other transport at the time. You didn\u2019t have\nbuses, you didn\u2019t have subways, you didn\u2019t have zip. This meant only army vehicles. The fact\nis there simply wasn\u2019t any other transport yet. Still this meant quite a bit. Again Dad left the\nhouse with nothing but a little money for necessities which themselves weren\u2019t easy to buy.\nThe military authorities gave Dad very good advice. The told him he must begin his search\nnorth of the rivers because Holland is in the middle divided by a bunch of rivers. Because there\nwas known that in the province Overeisel there were children who had been bought for hiding\nso the story goes light haired children above the rivers which wasn\u2019t true of you at all. What\nCelene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark\nhaired Jewish children would go to the south of Holland where most of the people were\nCatholic and were darker and the lighter skinned, lighter haired Jewish people would go to the\nnorth because there were Protestants who were lighter. So Dad began with the purpose in front\nof his eyes, good or bad from one empty army truck or another finally ending up in the city of\nNaivadol in Overeisel. We had never heard of this place before. Once in Naivadol Dad\nimmediately went to City Hall. There he spoke to several bureaucrats. One of them, Mr.\nBucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries Andy\u2019s foster mother on the large street in\nNaivadol. The man knew that there was a young boy that had been hidden. When he arrived at\nMrs. De Fries\u2019s home Dad was allowed in and saw to his stunned surprise a little boy of whom\nhe though thought this could well be Andy, his nephew. He had the family face and the age was\nalso right. Dad spoke with Mrs. De Fries. He explained his relationship telling her his name\nwhich at the moment was unknown to her. After a while and for different reasons she\nunderstood that Dad was the brother of the mother of this child who she had taken over under\nher protection and who she was very fond of. Dad was very lucky to have found Andy. For\nMrs. De Fries this was not a happy day. Dad could see that it would not be easy to get Andy\nfrom her but that\u2019s a tale apart. It got to be late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper\nand slept there. The few hours that were left Dad played with Andy. Andy sat on Dad\u2019s lap and\nbegan to play with his ear lobe. This was a habit that Dad\u2019s younger brother Yope one out of\neight brothers and sisters always did as a little kid. Mr. Bucker from City Hall also knew to tell\nDad that a few kilometers between Naivadol and the town of Chaino stood an old small farm\nwhere there was also a young boy brought underground. He suggested that Dad should check\nthis farm out because that in any event he left Mrs. De Fries and planned to return for Andy.\nShe actually didn\u2019t give Dad any indication that she understood that she had to be separated\nfrom Andy at some point in the future. Dad departed from Andy with mixed feelings from this\ncomplicated situation. It was early in the morning when Dad continued his search for you. He\nhad to travel the long kilometers on foot. He often said to me how he walked and walked and in\nthe evening dead tired arrived somewhere on the side of a road in the village of Chaino. He\nrang the bell of the farm. It was already dark and about ten o\u2019clock. He waited for someone to\nanswer the door which didn\u2019t happen right away. They were people who were used to going to\nbed early and they were by then fast asleep. Dad kept ringing the bell and finally a man stuck\nhis head out of the attic window and asked what was going on. In the hope that the sound of a\nchild crying was your crying Dad screwed up his courage to begin a conversation with this man.\nHe told the man who he was and why he had come. They didn\u2019t plan to open the door right\naway answering Dad. The child\u2019s parents died and that\u2019s why we took him through the\nintervention of our pastor. At this point Dad asked to be let in, in any case. He wanted them to\nknow who he was by comparing something he had with him. Oh I guess from reading this I see\nthat they brought me to him that evening. I thought that he slept over. Dad was allowed in and\nright away showed the man a lamb\u2019s wool baby shirt because a similar one had been left with\nthe baby boy when he was sent underground. This was from the lamb\u2019s wool bathing suit that\nthey had made. The organization that provided contact with underground hiding places had told\nthe family to save it in case the child had to be brought to another place. Luckily in your\nsituation this advice was heeded. After comparing the two pieces this was evidence enough that\nthe truth was being spoken here. Only then did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of\nabout two years old. Dad saw in the blink of an eye that 1t was his son. What a moment it must\nhave been. It was and is to value how these people didn\u2019t clam up but in one night were made\n100% certain before believing something of the parental bond that was being talked about here.\nThis is understandable. Here I could write some things but that I won\u2019t and don\u2019t want to. Pll\nleave that to imagination. The truth is I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about here and I'd really\nbe curious. What Dad told me about this after he took you in his arms that is not to be\ndescribed except by Dad himself. And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who\nplayed a large role in your and our lives. After an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to\nsleep there overnight. You and the family slept upstairs while Dad was given a hay mattress\nand a small room downstairs. From everything that Dad could see these people were very\nsimple farmers, in fact poor people who notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold\nthemselves together. The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was\neighty. His wife who was also in her sixties wore a wig which was very unusual in those years.\nThey had an unmarried son who was about twenty eight years old who could be mistaken for\nforty and an unmarried young daughter. When I saw them later I could see that they were a\nvery stiff but decent people. When she says stiff she means that they were Dutch Reformed,\nvery conservative. The people were as good for you as they could be because with them there\nwas also great hunger which was readily apparent. They had one horse and a few chickens left\nover. The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the land for other farmers. For this\nhe would every day get a plate of oatmeal and once in a while an egg. You Jack, would sit by\nhim and he would share his oatmeal and egg with you. Mrs. De Chot told how she took apart\none of her bedspreads and used the thread to make a coverall for you because all of your clothes\nwere too small. She also said she cut the tips of your shoes off so that they would still fit.\n(Laughter) Remarkable. You know I haven\u2019t read this in a few years. This can be seen from a\nphoto that she made of you, her son and herself. When I look at the photo and when I had first\nseen it I had the impression that she had made this coverall for the occasion of the photograph\nfor which she derived great pleasure. I\u2019ve never seen this photo. Not knowing that she would\nhave to give you up. Later at our first meeting she said that she never would have given you up\nhad it not been your real parents who claimed you. She had planned to have you baptized but\nour appearance had prevented this. Too bad I would have been covered there too. There was no\ndoubt at all that these people were very fond of you and the son played the role of father even\nmore so than the older man. This became quite clear later on. The family came out of a\nReform Protestant background. They were very formal and lived just like Mrs. De Fries with\nher bible on the table. Almost everybody in Overeisel lived like this. I just want to interrupt\nthis reading by saying something that I have found out in the last half a year that there was in\nfact a group in Holland, there was a group of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were\ninstrumental in providing hiding places for Jewish children like myself and this group was\ncalled the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the anonymous\nholding company which is a wonderful surrealistic title I think. And my cousin Yanika from\nCalifornia has been receiving this information and recently sent me an article about an older\nman who is very pivotal in this group who was captured and killed and in the article there is a\nlist of children\u2019s names of their name, the date they were born and where they were hidden and\nmy name is in there and I saw it and it was a remarkable experience to get this. I called my\ncousin Yanika and I said to her I got this, this is wonderful. And she says to me what did you\nfeel like when you saw your name? And I said well the truth is I felt wonderful. It confirms all\nthese things and I said and how did you feel and she said well I wept and I wept and I wept.\nShe is 57 so she\u2019s older than me and she remembers our grandparents. She remembers going\nout every day when she was hidden underground waiting for her parents to come back so she\nhas that experience. But for me it was a remarkable experience to see my name Isaac\nTrompettor and then Overeisel which is the province where I was and then a question mark next\nto Overeisel that may mean we don\u2019t know where in Overeisel. It was a stunning experience\nfor me to see that and it was all the result of me spending the last years of searching this out. I\nknow my parents were very resistant to that for a long time and I feel very vindicated that I\npursued this and stayed with it, that I got this. It\u2019s very important to me. I would emphatically\nencourage other people who have similar or like stories to do that. When you do find out real\ndocumented pieces of what you\u2019ve always heard in your family it\u2019s emotionally very fulfilling\nand powerful.",
        "Q: I imagine. Do you want to choose maybe one or two more things to read.\nA? Sure. Ill just read this last page. In the few days that it was necessary for Dad to stay there,\nthere was so much conversation from which Dad had heard that in the beginning there was also\nanother young boy about twelve years old who they also hid. Mrs. De Chot had noticed that\nwhen she was away and came home to you, you were crying and the young boy had frightened\nyou and the crying got worse instead of better. It turned out that he would light the stove and\nput me head first into the stove, this boy. I\u2019d rather not believe it but it was enough for them to\nbring this boy somewhere else because they wanted to keep you. So I can imagine seeing this\nother young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me. He had to go\nsomewhere else and who knows what happened to this boy. I think this accounts for some of my\nhaving a nervous breakdown after the war, being fricasseed. Now it was time for Dad to figure\nout how to come home. He knew that I didn\u2019t know what was going on nor did he have an\nopportunity to inform me. You know there were no phones then that were working. The next\nmorning Dad went to the church, spoke with the pastor. What Dad told him was sufficient\nenough for Dad to take you without any official authorization. The church had a lot of\ninfluence with people. You could go to the church and make it clear to them you were the\nparent and the church would go to the people and talk to them and convince them. From there\nwe went to the local military authority who provided him with a transportation pass so that\nwhen transport went south both of you could go on it. It took four\nThat's my Mom.jpgThat's my Mom.jpgdays before an empty truck came your way. Those\nfour days were actually very necessary because you two got to know each other. The morning\nwhen the truck arrived Dad and you left for Tilburg promising the De Chots to keep in touch\nand he would let them know how you were doing. Naturally we kept our word. We did. We\nwere in touch and visited those people up until we went to America. It was also the time at least\naccording to my parents that they got to be very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert\nme. I suspect that this was not entirely so and maybe what my parents had to flush out in order\nto make the necessary separation from these people. I mean it\u2019s complex and subtle stuff with\nthis last little chapter. What Dad clearly remembers about this trip was that as long as the ride\ntook, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he got wet, too. You also cried often during the\ntrip. How could it be otherwise sitting in the back for hours with the feeling of wet pants, no\nfood or drink, as well as the crowding of many other people around you. While you possibly\nhad been so used to the quiet all of a sudden such a huge change. I have often thought about\nthis especially if I had been the one to carry you instead of Dad. I have also often thought about\nhow I would have felt if I had been the one to see you first at the De Chots. To understand that\nI could see you in front of me to spoil you and take you with me. What would that have felt\nlike? This will always be a question. The other question that should always be a question and\nunfortunately didn\u2019t get addressed in our family was what was it like for me to be adopted by\nmy parents. Powerful stuff.",

        "A: Well my Hebrew name is Isaac, Yitzhak. I was given the name Jack at the time because it was\nnot safe, I suppose, to call children Isaac. I was born in Amsterdam. I was born in a hospital\nwhich, at the time, was taken over by the Germans and used for their Wehrmacht wounded. So\nthere was my mother lying there and having me and because the family name in Trompettor, not\nCohen or Nathanson, it wasn\u2019t evident giveaway that it was a Jewish name.",
        "A: This was August 2, 1942. When my mother gave birth to me it was also the same time that my\nfather had been arrested. He was arrested in what\u2019s called a razia which was a raid which was\nwhat the Germans at that point would do in 1942. They would come into a Jewish\nneighborhood, seal off the streets, and then just pick up all the men that they could find and in\nthis case my father was caught and he was taken to Oester Park, East Park which is a park in\nAmsterdam where they held them. And then they transported them, to the Uterperstaad which\nwas where the Gestapo had their central headquarters and it was a school that they took over\nand they had some kind of, I think, gymnasium building, or some gymnasium-like building\nwhere they had all the men lie down, belly, face down and they beat the men on the backs and\non the legs. We, of course found all this out afterwards. My father was arrested. My mother\ndid not know where he was. She gives birth to me. She is understandably terribly, terribly\nanxious and afraid. There was a curfew at this time and no Jews are allowed on the streets at\ncertain hours which made it all very difficult to do shopping and even visiting someone at the\nhospital. But it turned out that my mother\u2019s father, he was a man in his late sixties who wasn\u2019t\nafraid and really didn\u2019t, I suppose, care about this curfew. He was going to see his daughter and\ngrandson.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know; it\u2019s a good question. He came to visit my mother every day during the\nperiod when my father was -- his whereabouts were unknown. My mother got ill after she gave\nbirth to me. I guess anxiety and everything. She was beside herself. Finally, and I don\u2019t know\nwithin how many days this transpires, I think maybe three or four or five, my father is let go.\nHe calls up his work place. They send a cart which was what you had in Holland then which\nwas to transport goods. You had a bicycle with sort of a cart in front and they put him in the\ncart and they took him home. The reason they did that was because he could barely walk\nbecause he was beaten on his legs. It\u2019s an interesting story how he actually got out. And how\nhe got out was, as he told it, all the captives were lined up. And they had the Gestapo, they had\nthe green police, they had the Dutch police, those Dutch police who were collaborators. They\nhad all levels of police. Everyone wanted to be a brute of some kind. Everyone wanted to get\nin, in some way. The Germans were very, very concerned with TB. They were very, very\nconcerned with that, I guess, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for, plagues or some kind of -- what\u2019s\nthe word I\u2019m looking for -- not a plague.",
        "A: Some contagious disease, thank you. And they had a doctor who was a Jewish doctor look at all\nthe men and ask the men, the captives, questions. Based on these questions the men were let\ngo. And to be let go meant to be kicked in behind and told to get the hell out and never come\nback or whatever. The Germans were so afraid of contagious diseases that their solution to\ncontagious disease was to throw people out. This doctor was someone my father had known.\nIn the twenties my father had some kind of a lung problem and it wasn\u2019t TB. But at the time\nyou carried with you some kind of identity card I think that you with if you had some kind of a\nmedical emergency you could whip it out. So he had a card with him and somehow he had the\ngood sense to have the card out or show it to the doctor and the doctor and German officers are\nstanding at this point in front of my father and the tension is throughout all this very, very\nintense and very high and a lot of questions are being asked and crisscrossed. At the same time\nthe German asks the doctor if this man has TB because of the card. He ends up saying yes. But\nif turns out he\u2019s saying yes to another officer\u2019s demand who is saying, mach shnell, mach\nshnell, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. The level of tension was purposely created by the\nGermans. This is what they did to disempower people, to terrorize them. And it was a tactic; it\nwas a Strategy. It wasn\u2019t simply people losing their temper. It was a strategy of terrifying\npeople. So they\u2019re asking what\u2019s going on, mach shnell, yes. It seems to be misunderstood by\nthe head officer that my father indeed had TB. So they grabbed him, they boot him 1n his\nbehind, they throw him out, lucky him. He gets to a phone, calls up his work place. They send\nover the bicycle and the cart. He comes home to discover he\u2019s had a son. I don\u2019t think he was\nable to visit my mother or myself in the hospital. My mother comes home. Everybody is very\nhappy to have me. I was named Isaac, Yitzhak, he who laughs. The first time I asked my\nparents, when talking with them about the war experiences why they would want to have a child\nduring this time, why they had me. They said it was their blow against Hitler. And I have very\nmixed feelings about this. It makes me a little choked up as it does right now because I feel in\nsome way it casts me in some kind of historical responsibility and there are times where I would\nsay I wish that they didn\u2019t have me then on one hand. On the other hand I\u2019m always grateful\nthat they provided themselves to bring me into the world. That\u2019s the bottom line. So I am the\nblow against Hitler.",
        "A: Yes, my family name Trompettor. There is some dispute whether we are Sephardic which is\nTrompaita or whether we are Ashkenazim from the East. I don\u2019t know. I tend to think we were\nSephardim. The reason for that, actually, is a number of years ago Time Magazine, the New\nYork Times Sunday magazine had an article on Spain. On the cover they had a picture of a\nyoung boy who trained horses and it looks just like me, like I did when I was young. So there\u2019s\na cast to my face that would give that some authenticity. So I think we were Sephardim\nalthough we did not speak Latino in our family nor did we speak Hebrew in our family. My\nparents were working class people. My mother had three brothers. My father had three\nbrothers and three sisters.\nQ They all were from Amsterdam?",
        "A: Yes, we were Amsterdam working class people. Amsterdam by the Dutch was known as\nMokum, M-O-K-U-M, which was a, I don\u2019t know how but it was a Yiddish word for\nAmsterdam and it got into the lexicon. The Dutch refer to Amsterdam often as Mokum. Not\njust the Jews use that term. And the Jews in Holland, I think I\u2019d say you know who came from\nthe East and came from Spain and Holland was very hospitable to them. My parents family,\nmany of them worked in the diamond cutting and polishing industry which was the main\nindustry for the Jews as well as textiles. You had different Jewish neighborhoods in\nAmsterdam. There was one neighborhood called the gold coast which was where the more\nwell-to-do Jewish people would live. Then there was what was the Yodebrastaat which is the\nwide Jewish street which is, I think, also the street where Rembrandt had his tourist home right\nnow. It was a large Jewish community. It\u2019s the southeast of Amsterdam. It\u2019s where many of\nthe Dutch Jews lived.",
        "A: No, I know. Yes my parents\u2019 family lived in the neighborhood of the Yodebrastaat. We lived\nright after the war in the Tunsvalstraat right on the Tunsvalkad which was a canal as Amsterdam\nis crisscrossed by canals. Is there anything else I could say about my parents?",
        "A: Yes, my parents both went to Hebrew school when they were younger. We were not a kosher\nhome. You must understand that the Dutch Jews were mostly working class people and while\nmy parents and their families set a table every Friday night there were no prayers said and I\ndon\u2019t think there were blessings said over the bread or wine with the meal but all the children\nwould be there for that dinner and some with their sweetie pies and after dinner they would all\nleave for their Friday night gallivanting, you know young people. There\u2019s not much talk in my\nfamily of poverty or anything like that even during the depression. There were hard times.\nThere was always food. My father worked in the food trades, in the restaurant trade and always\nhad food, brought home food. So there was always that. And also he was one of the brothers\nwho always seemed to have worked during the hard years. My grandmothers did not work.\nThey were grandmothers which was a job in itself. My mother and father knew each other\nwhen they were in their late teens. And as my mother tells it, she had a crush on my father\nbecause he was so quiet and sweet and I guess, polite. They met each other through my father\u2019s\nsister Maricha, Marie who perished and had become sweethearts very early on and had been\nvery fond of each other and close to each other. It was, I guess, in those days that you paired up\nreal early. But they were engaged for a long time. They didn\u2019t married until they were thirty\nand the reason for that is that they wanted to save money for furniture. And now my mother\ntalks about how she regrets in light of course not knowing about the war that they didn\u2019t get\nmarried sooner and have babies sooner. And I always kind of wondered why they didn\u2019t have\nmore babies and in some ways regret not having children.",
        "A: Yes, of course. You know at a certain age if you don\u2019t send them a birthday card you have hell\nto pay. My father was born in 1911, May 25\". My mother was born in 1910, June 14\". So\nwe're all summer babies.",
        "A: Yes, she was a seamstress. She talks about having loved her career as a seamstress. In her\nmanuscript which she spent seven years writing she talks about the shop she was in. She talks\nabout the labor struggles. During this time there were many, many labor struggles. My parents\nwere as many Dutch Jews were working class people and by and large they voted for the Social\nDemocratic Party which here we would mistakenly call Socialist or Left. They were a liberal\ndemocratic party whose interests represented working class people. And they also took part of\nthe culture of the Social Democratic Parties and on the first of May, you\u2019d have picnics, you\u2019d\nhave festivals. You would often have camping trips that these parties of the Left provided for\nyoung people which my parents often went to. And your question before about a religious\nhousehold, I do not recall ever having heard my parents talk about a religious household\nalthough there are some times now when I talk to my mother and she disputes that. And I think\nshe may dispute it because there is some matter of pride but I don\u2019t think, and she would know\nbetter than I what happened in those years, but I never heard talk about her religious upbringing.\nI know we never had a kosher home. The first time I stepped into a shul was when I was Bar\nMitzvahed.",
        "A: Before we were Bar Mitzvahed my parents pleaded with my brother and I to go to shul for the\nHigh Holidays and we didn\u2019t. And we compromised. We said well we\u2019ll get dressed and we\u2019ll\nwalk around temple so everyone will see us but we\u2019re not going in because we didn\u2019t know\nHebrew and also being refugees and being survivors we felt in a way alienated from the Jewish\ncommunity about us. And that is something that is very typical of people with our story. In\nsome way we were met with a lot of not understanding. I always have felt very alienated from\nJudaism. I knew when I grew up in Brooklyn there were times where I would be beaten up for\nbeing Jewish. Easter would roll around and the Italian kids, boys, would come from Avenue X\nand we lived on Avenue Z and Avenue Y was a dividing line and you had the Italian people\nliving on Avenue X and the Jewish people living on Avenue Z. And as what was popularly\nknown then Jewish boys did not fight. They did not fight. So Easter would come around and I\nwith my friends would be playing outside and Italian boys would come into the neighborhood\nand they would tell us we killed Christ. And I didn\u2019t know who this boy Christ was, I had no\nidea. And I certainly knew that I and no one had killed anybody recently. So they would attack\nus and beat us up. We didn\u2019t know about fighting back. So that happened a few times. And I\nguess that was one of many punctuation marks in my feeling not Jewish. And for many years I\ndid not in some way come out as being Jewish. I did not come forward with it. I did not\ncultivate my social relationships based on people being Jewish. I had friends from all kinds of\ngroups as I do now.",
        "A: Well, yes, yes. We came to America in 1949, my parents, my brother, who was really my step-\nbrother as I'll go on to tell later, my aunt and uncle and their two daughters. We lived in Far\nRockaway. First few months we had an attic and we all slept on cots in the attic. And then at\nsome point we got an apartment in Rockaway. We got two basement apartments which were\nabout three blocks from the ocean which us kids in the family absolutely loved because it meant\nour summers we had a lot to do and to play. But in the spring when the rains came the\nbasement would always be flooded and we\u2019d always have to buy a new rug. So it was a sort of\nimmigrant story. And then in 1951 when Beachhaven which was one of the first projects that\nFred Trump built (which is the Donald\u2019s father) built in Brooklyn, my parents moved out there.\nIt was a very big step. It really was an attempt for my parents to start to build something for us.\nAt one point they talked about wanting to move to Long Island which was also considered a\nstep up and buy a home there which they never did. I as of late come to understand that there\nwas a subtext to our life which was around the matter of denial and that had to do with getting\non with life and putting all that stuff behind us, just get on with life.",
        "A: There\u2019s plenty. So I was born on August second. This was the time when people were already\nbeing deported to Vestaburg which was a transit camp in the north of Holland, in the moors,\nGod forsaken nowhere place. From Vestaburg every Tuesday the transport went east. People\nwent either to Auschwitz, to Treblinka, to Sobibor, to Chelmo where most of my grandparents,\naunts and uncles perished. Because our name was Trompettor and as I said not like Cohen or a\nlot of typical Dutch Jewish names my father who belonged to a butcher\u2019s union which was\ntaken over by the Dutch Fascists, the Jewish names would all be crossed off. Trompettor was\nnot crossed off which meant we would continue to get their news letter but this time with the\nNational Socialist masthead on it. So my father would conspicuously leave it on a little side\ntable by the door in case there were raids and people would come in they would see this and\nthink my father was not Jewish. Upstairs though in the same house lived my mother\u2019s parents.\nDuring this time the Jewish Council in Amsterdam as there were in many countries had a list of\nall the people who were in Holland who were Jewish and the list was made available to the\nGermans. And I know there is much argument about the role of the Jewish Council. Because\nmy parents were, I guess, working class people and sympathetic to the left of the political\nspectrum they had a certain kind of savvy about what was happening. In Holland from \u201933 on\nyou had over 25,000 German Jewish refugees so stories got around. People got a sense of the\nbrutality that was there. When my father was arrested and beaten up as he tells it, he was of\ncourse among other things shocked. Something like this never happened to him and he felt that\nwith this kind of brutality it was going to get worse and nothing would stop the Germans and\nthat if they were capable of this no one was safe. And that\u2019s what he felt. Before that happened\nthere was the curfew, there were people being taken away, there were street fights in Jewish\nneighborhoods. Dutch fascists would come into the Jewish neighborhoods, the ice-cream\nparlors, the tea houses and start fights and there would be these altercations. But when he was\nbeaten up he understood how bad it was and he decided then he was going to go underground.\nHe was not going to register. My mother\u2019s brother, Shok who is the name I was given, Jack, in\nhonor of him, I think he was a very active Socialist and as my mother tells the story right before\nor after I was born she\u2019s in my parents\u2019 home and my mother\u2019s brother Shok is still living there\nshe enters into his room and sees him with a tallis and he\u2019s praying. And she is shocked\nbecause she\u2019s known him as a what should we call it an agnostic, an atheist. My mother says\nwhat\u2019s going on? And he says, well he\u2019s praying so his parents won\u2019t be taken away and has\ndecided that he will go and register in their place. Throughout the early period of the German\noccupations and the subjugation of the Jewish community there were continual regulations that\nwere tended to deceive people. One of them was that if the young people in the family would\nregister, the old people would not be taken. This was of course a way of sabotaging and\nundermining any form of resistance and many, many people believed it. You have to\nunderstand and appreciate that. What some people might see as stupidity or cooperation isn\u2019t\nquite that. It has to be understood in the context of Holland is a country that\u2019s very much\nconcerned with law, with rules, with order. I always feel that they\u2019re kind of caught between\nthe anvil of Calvinism and the hammer of Anarchism and the reason for that is because cities\nlike Amsterdam and Rotterdam are international cities and the Dutch have been for a few\nhundred years an international merchant people. So not to register was considered an illegal act\neven though it was clear to many that those who were in power, who made the law, were evil.\nBut my father decided he was not going to register, he was going to do something else. That\nwas a very big step. It was the first step to resistance. Many people of course had no idea what\nwas going on in the east after the transports. People really believed they were going to be\nsettled in some farm somewhere to dig potatoes and till the soil. But because my father had a\ncertain political savvy he knew what German Fascism meant as people did. So he decided he\nwas not going to register; he was going to go underground. The problem was what does that\nmean? How do you do it? Who do you make contact with? Who do you trust? And it was all\nluck. So my mother\u2019s brother Shok decides he\u2019s going to register to save the grandparents. He\nregisters. He is sent to Vestaborg. At some point from Vestaborg he sends my mother a card,\nmy mother and father a card that says don\u2019t bring the red baby wagon which was their code for\nsaying do not come, do not bring Jackie as I was known because even in Vestaborg which was\nnot as horrible as the camps in the east there was constructed to deceive people. Actually when\nI say this I am stunned at how remarkable the deception was, to be deceived. In some way I\nknow this is in hindsight I get very angry at it. How could people be so stupid? And on the\nother hand how can I say that? And all of it is a, it\u2019s a mix of feelings one has, I have.",
        "A: Yeah, but you know they had people coming in from Germany from 1933 with stories.",
        "A: Hitler and Hitler did not have a reputation other than terrorism, cajoling, bullyism. He\u2019s the\nultimate form of European bullyism. So my father comes home; Iam born. They decide\nthey\u2019re going to go underground. And one of the terrible things that also happens is that one\nconsiders the older people, the grandparents. What do they do? How do they go underground?\nAnd the family is kind of in some way the younger people start to provide for themselves. This\nis a question my cousins and I have often wondered about. What about the grandparents; what\ndo you do? And I understand it\u2019s a terrible question and it\u2019s one I have asked my mother and\nnever really gotten any kind of a satisfactory answer and I\u2019m a little bit ashamed to even pursue\nit. But I wonder about it. I can tell you one story, terrible story. My father has the newspaper\nwith the National Socialist masthead left at the table. There is a raid one day. The Dutch\npolice, the green police which were the German police come in. They know the people who\nlive upstairs are Jewish. They come to take them away. It turns out to be my mother\u2019s parents\nand it is my mother\u2019s mother\u2019s, my grandmother\u2019s birthday that this happens. And my mother\nof course 1s beside herself in shock, terrible, terrible. You can imagine how terrible something\nlike that is. My father gathers his wits; he goes to the police. He says, we\u2019ve known our\nneighbors for a long time could we please say goodbye to them? The Germans say yes. So\nhere are my parents saying goodbye. My father is saying goodbye to his in-laws, my mother is\nsaying goodbye to her parents as if they were just neighbors. It\u2019s a terrible thing and I often\nwonder what my mother has done with that pain and that grief. She has written it all down. So\nmy mother\u2019s parents are taken away. I don\u2019t know whether at this point before or after my\nfather\u2019s parents are taken away. Some of the brothers and sisters have been taken away, some\nhave not. Those that remain decide to go underground and it means you don\u2019t tell anyone else\nwhere you\u2019re going because it\u2019s unsafe. All you could do 1s tell your parents goodbye. When\npeople went underground at the time they had no idea for how long this would be. No one\nknew. Some people thought weeks, months. No one thought of years. My parents had saved\nsome money so they had money that they knew they would need to provide for their keep while\nthey were underground. They made a connection through someone they knew who knew\nsomeone who knew someone to two people whose names are Cory and Jan Van Nomberg who\nare people who I now know as my aunt and uncle who live in Tilburg who we have been very\nclose to since the war; people who I\u2019m very, very fond of. He was in the Dutch cavalry. He\nwas a sort of, I wouldn\u2019t say monarchist, but he was a very good Dutch patriot. They came\nfrom Tilburg, a Catholic family. Holland is kind of divided like that. The people in the south\nare Catholic, the people in the north are Protestant. They came from a good Catholic family but\nhe hated the Germans. Not that he hated National Socialism but he hated the Germans because\nthey invaded his country. He wanted to do something. My parents ended up with them. At first\nthe story was that my father was on the run; he didn\u2019t want to serve in the army. I don\u2019t know,\nwhat you would call a deserter. So they were taken in by Cory and Jan based on that. But there\nis a sense that Cory and Jan did kind of know that that was not the story, that they might be\nJews. At some point early on in their underground experience it becomes apparent, it\u2019s talked\nabout and Cory and Jan decide well we\u2019ve gone this far with you we\u2019re not going to turn you\naway. And my parents spent from November of 1942 till the liberation in May with these\npeople. I went underground about a week, a few days or a week before they went underground.\nI was three months old when I went underground. You can imagine, if you can imagine what it\nwas like for my mother to give up her child with the hope that she is saving my life with always\nthe knowledge of the possibility I\u2019m being offered up to destruction. We were one of the lucky\nfamilies. We all survived. My parents survived. I survived.",
        "A: I was circumcised. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand why people would take the chance of\ndoing that, would take the chance because when there were raids the Germans would pull down\nthe pants of the men in the street to see if they were Jewish. Remarkable, remarkable, crude to\nsay the least. Yeah, but you know I guess you circumcise your child to show your fealty. It\u2019s a\npractice that I have real questions about. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve gotten lost in some -- I\u2019m not in a\ntrack.",
        "A: Yes, I was sent underground. I spent the first night with my mother\u2019s brother\u2019s wife, Ollie, who\nwas a gentile woman, my mother\u2019s brother Morris, his first wife died in childbirth. He marries\nOllie. Ollie is a gentile woman. Ollie has me for one or two nights and my parents know\nnothing of who has me or where I am. The deal is if the family goes underground it\u2019s best to\nseparate the children because at least that will raise the chances of someone surviving. So I go\nwith Ollie and eventually I\u2019m passed on to other people. I spend a short time in a Quaker\nchildren\u2019s home, a very short time. It turns out that when my parents are also underground\nCory, of Cory and Jan who are taking care of my parents, Cory goes to check on me to see how\nIam. This is done without telling my mother. My father knows about it, Jan knows about it. I\ndon\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t tell my mother. They made some assumptions. Cory goes to see\nhow I am doing. She goes to the Quaker home. She\u2019s there. She has a bad feeling about the\nplace. She takes me out of there right away. She spends a night with me in the woods. They\ntalk about that there was fighting or shelling somewhere around there but it\u2019s 1942 so I don\u2019t\nreally understand whether there\u2019s resistance activity or what but this is how it\u2019s talked about.\nShe gets me to another place. I am finally placed in a place called Hino which is about 35\nkilometers from the German border with a very poor Protestant family, people who are in their\nsixties, the family De Chot. Cory comes back which she does. She has the good sense to go to\na place that\u2019s sort of like the equivalent of a Fotomat. She has a picture taken of me that she can\nbring back and show my mother. My mother, in this time, doesn\u2019t know why Cory has been\ngone for so long. Jan and my father know but they get worried. She doesn\u2019t come home until\nvery, very late the next day and she lays it out to my mother. Your boy is safe. We had to take\nhim out of there. They find out subsequently it turns out that the next day this place 1s raided --\nthat children are taken out of there. The adults there are arrested. Remarkable. So Cory has\nthis sense, has her sixth sense.",
        "A: There were many, many Jewish children. What they would do is they would mix the Jewish\nchildren in with the -- it was like a Quaker orphanage -- with other children. And this was often\nhow it was done when Jewish children were hidden in groups, in France and Belgium and\nHolland. This is how it was done. When the children like myself went underground the parents\nwere told to remember the clothes that the children had on. The people who received the\nchildren like myself were told to save that clothing because it was the only way to identify a\nchild. So the story goes that my mother had a bathing suit that they cut up. Because she was a\nseamstress they made a little pants for me, a little top and a little hat. This is what I was\ndelivered in eventually to the De Chot family and this is what they kept... So what we are all in\nhiding, my parents not knowing whether I\u2019m alive or where Iam. My mother tells the story that\nevery night before she went to sleep she would pray for my well -being. They had cut a lock of\nhair from my head that she had and she would use this as some kind of reliquary, some kind of\ntalisman pray for my hair, pray for me. Every night ask my father when was it going to be over\nwas it going to be all right. And of course what could the poor man do but say yes my dear, of\ncourse. So they were hidden with Cory and Jan from the end of November till May of 1945.\nFor almost three years I was separated from my parents. When I first agreed to do this\ninterview, when I was told about it my first response was well you know there are so many\npeople who are older who have more powerful, more horrible stories to tell, they\u2019re important\nto know. And then I thought but who will tell the story of people like myself who were at this\nage if I don\u2019t. So it was a big step for me to decide to do it because in the community of people\nwho are survivors, people who are camp survivors, people who are underground survivors,\nthere has been a kind of presumptuously established hierarchy of suffering, that those who were\nin the camps suffered the most and they probably did. They did indeed. But it meant that for\nthose of us who didn\u2019t suffer like that we couldn\u2019t really tell our story because it was not as bad\nbecause we had that one potato that we should be happy for. And this has been very\nproblematic. Because of the conference last May this was a subject that was brought up and\ntalked about. And even at the conference I had an instant where I was in an elevator and there\nwas an older woman standing there, a short woman, and she had a little identity card which we\nall had which said our name, what country we were from, where we were hidden and what\nyears. And she\u2019s squinting up and she is Dutch as I can see and I chat with her and she\u2019s\nsquinting up and looking and says oh you were just a baby. And I was very angry with her and I\nthought how can you be so thoughtless at this place. But it is part of the problem. It is the\nproblem who were in camps -- although to feel and I can\u2019t be anything but sympathetic with\nthat but 1t doesn\u2019t allow me to tell my story. And I think this is an issue that has now been\nbrought forth and dealt with as being one of the issues that we all have, that it\u2019s all authentic.",
        "A: The British and Canadians. In Holland, I was in the north of Holland, my parents were in the\nsouth of Holland. The south of Holland was liberated some time early of \u201945 and people at the\ntime didn\u2019t know what was going on in the north but in the north you had what was called the\nhunger winter because as the Germans were being defeated and withdrawing they took all the\nfoodstuffs they could lay their hands on and the consequence was that something like 15,000\npeople in northern Holland died of hunger because there wasn\u2019t anything they could put in their\nstomach, remarkable. I lived on a farm. Fortunately there was some food available. I\u2019m told\nthe story that the people who took care of me would share everything they had with me and it\nwas very, very little. When I was finally found I looked like a picture of what we see today of\nstarving children. I had a swelled head, tiny little body, skinny bones. But I had my share of\nwhat other people had. And I guess for my parents to have seen me eventually like this and to\nknow this made it difficult for them. It raised the guilt ante for them; the guilt of having given\nme up even though the intent was to save my life. There were all kinds of complex inter-family\ndynamics come out of this.",
        "A: Good story. So my parents are liberated. They\u2019re living in Tilburg. Tilburg turns out to be a\nsort of central command place for the British and Canadian army as well as the place where all\nthe people who survived the camps come, all the Dutch Jews who come back -- all, the few --\nall, whatever twenty of them, come back to Tilburg and there; there\u2019s the Joint Committee of\nvarious Jewish organizations from America that help in finding people, in relocating people. It\nturns out that my father with the liberation gets a job with the British army as some kind of\ncook. He does this temporarily. They ask him to sign up for a year, whatever. He says forget\nit, he\u2019s out of it. As far as he knows he\u2019s the only male survivor of the family. He\u2019s going to\nfind out where the children are. He knows the children are hidden in Holland somewhere. He\u2019s\ngoing to find out where. So as the story goes, he like Charlie Chaplin has a stick on his\nshoulder with a bag at the end of it and because there was not yet any real public transportation\nhe hitchhikes on military vehicles -- goes to this village -- finds out there\u2019s a resistance group\nthere. There were a lot of church people who were instrumental in hiding children; finds this\npastor who turns him on to a priest, who turns him on to a mayor. He finally finds his way to\nknow that there is a young boy who fits my description who\u2019s hidden in Hino in this farm. He\u2019s\nhitchhiking. He appears there. It\u2019s night, it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s a farmhouse. He bangs on the door.\nPeople lean out the top window, what\u2019s going on, who 1s it? He tells the story. My name is\nGerrit Trompettor. I\u2019m looking for a young by described so and so. Would he be here? And\nthere is some pause and finally they say well yes. He comes in but they don\u2019t wake me, it\u2019s late\nat night. He sleeps in a hayloft or somewhere on the farm. In the morning I am brought to him,\nI sit on his lap and I say \u201cpeen in ma book, peen in ma book\u201d which is the Dutch rural\nexpression of \u201cpain in ma bouk\u201d which means pain in my stomach. Gerrit thinks I am talking\nabout a book. The Dutch word for stomach is \u201cbook is \u201cbook\u201d The Dutch word for stomach is\n\u2018\u201cbouk\u201d. Because I\u2019m speaking this flat rural accent he doesn\u2019t understand me. It turns out I\u2019m\ntalking about pain in my stomach. I\u2019m hungry or something. I don\u2019t know at what point he\ncomprehends that he and I are speaking an entirely different language. But it turns out that he\nhas a talk with the family. They find out he is my father, I\u2019m his son and he\u2019s come to take me.\nAnd I\u2019m having trouble right now recalling whether he takes me the first day or whether he\nleaves me there and he goes back and he gets Celene, the mom in this story. And it\u2019s interesting\nthat I\u2019m having trouble recalling that. I don\u2019t know. Anyway I am reunited with my family. I\nam undernourished. I am sickly. I am brought to a doctor who informs my parents that with\nfood and care in a short while Ill be back to normal, I\u2019ll be fine.",
        "A: No, I also find it very distressing that I have no recollection. But I\u2019m between the ages of three\nmonths and two years. Now I know there are stories of people who remember some things two,\nthree years. I have two recollections. One of them is that I am in a home, I am picked up and\nvery quickly brought to a second floor and I am put in a closet. In the closet is a hobby- horse.\nAnd I sit on the hobby- horse for a while and I hear voices downstairs and then later I\u2019m\nbrought downstairs again. I don\u2019t know whether this is a dream or a memory. That\u2019s all I really\nremember. And as I said it distresses me because I really have a need to know and understand\nmore about this period. In our family as it happened in many families after the war when there\nwere hidden parents and hidden children the main story in the family was that the parents were\nhidden and survived the war. And then there happened to be the story that the children were\nhidden and survived the war. But we were very young; we had no story to tell. So our story\nkind of fell into the background. And in those years, right after the war and even in the fifties\nand sixties there wasn\u2019t any understanding or talk or research or literature or anything on what it\nwas like for children who had to be reunited with the parents. I often talk about that I was\nadopted by my parents in 1945 because here I am a three year old kid who talks a different\nlanguage. It took my parents a while, my parents and I to understand each other. And here I am\nthinking, I suppose, that I\u2019ve been taken away from my parents by this new couple who tell me\nthey\u2019re my parents and there\u2019s the program and I have to get with the program. I have to love\nthem as they love me and it caused a great deal of problems. It still does.",
        "A: Well it has been, I have come to understand it as one of the main tensions. I have, I realize now,\nbeen a depressed man for many, many years. I have been an angry man as well and unable to\ncommit myself to many things. And I now understand what all that is about. I mean there are\npsychological dimensions to all of this that I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re important to speak\nabout whether this is pure quote unquote history or -- there are people who to this day suffer\nbecause of what happened to them during the war. There are others like myself who have\nproblems because of what happened right after the war because denial was the order of the day.\nAnd it meant that those of us who are younger could not delve into our story. I have always\nwhen I was a young man living with my parents asked them about the war, terrifically curious,\nas Iam now. And there was a way of finding my own voice and my own story. But when it\ncame to asking questions about the people I was with, what happened to them, what was it like,\nI always came up against some form of denial, always, always. In 1985, I think it was the year,\nit was the year before my father died, I was visiting my parents who since 1972 moved back to\nHolland. I was determined to find out more about my history and about these people, the De\nChot family. And I told them, I said I\u2019m going to find out about this. Id like you to help me.\nIf you don\u2019t, fine but I\u2019m going to do it anyway. Well my parents must have conferred that\nevening and reached a wise decision and said well we\u2019ll go with you. Let\u2019s make a day of it.\nSo the next day we drive to this area of Holland and we go to a City Hall of a town nearby to\nfind maps, names of people. We don\u2019t find much but we drive around and we drive to where\nmy father thinks the farm was. Well it turns out it\u2019s a major highway right now. There\u2019s\nnothing there -- it\u2019s obliterated but we do pass through what\u2019s the other town where my\nbrother/cousin was hidden and he was like fifteen kilometers from me and nobody knew. But\nwe saw the house that he was hidden in and we recognized it because we had a photo that was\nmade right after the war and it showed the same wrought iron fence, a very beautiful intricate\ndesign and it was immediately clear. My brother who was really my first cousin was taken care\nof by a woman, Mrs. De Fries, a very fine woman, a religious woman who had a hard time\ngiving him up. But after the war my parents stayed in close contact with her and in the early\nfifties she came and spent part of a summer vacation with us. My parents in some ways were\nvery wise. They knew that the separation between us and our foster parents would be\nproblematic and in some way no matter what people did out of the best of intentions there\nwould be problems. And I realize this now. I see a therapist twice a week which is enormously\nhelpful. It\u2019s paid for by the Dutch government. And I talk about all this stuff and I never talked\nabout this before and I\u2019ve come to some understandings and one of the things I\u2019ve come to\nunderstand is that we were given up for hiding with the best of intentions -- out of nothing but\nlove and care. But it still caused us problems. And it\u2019s I feel a terrible dilemma for my parents\nthat out of the best of intentions we were damned if we did and we were damned if we didn\u2019t\nand we have this to deal with and it makes me, I was going to use the word angry, the truth 1s I\nam outraged and livid that I should now have to deal with this stuff in my lifetime that I\u2019m a\nman who has a hard time relaxing, who does not feel safe and secure in the world, I\u2019m so angry\nat that and to be gifted with life but to be born at a terrible time.",
        "A: My cousin Andy\u2019s parents were Cheel, Macheel and his mother Maricha, Marie. They went\nunderground but they were caught and they perished in -- I call him my brother Andy, it\u2019s a\nhabit. My brother\u2019s father which is not my father perished a few weeks before the liberation.\nHe was shot on one of the marches from Auschwitz. My mother, his mother perished in \u00b044. I\nhave an album here, of course you can\u2019t see it on tape, that a distant relative in Holland made\nfor us where it\u2019s a genealogical tracing of the family and in it we have listings of people and\nunder the listing where it says when they died, where they died we have, well here it says\nHolocaust to say that he perished -- Judah Zomerplak some of my mother\u2019s family. People\nperished in Treblinka; they perished in Auschwitz, they perished in Sobibor. So my brother\u2019s\nparents perished, his mother in the camp. The adults at the time they were deciding to go\nunderground made this agreement, that whoever survived would take in the children who, God\nwilling, survived. It turned out that my brother, Andy was taken in by my parents.",
        "A: How did they find him? They found him -- my father found me, my brother, my cousin Sylvia,\nmy cousin Yanaka. Just by tracing he found us all, quite remarkable. He found us and I always\nremember knowing that Andy was my brother. What did I know from first cousin. Some time I\nthink when he was ten or eleven years old in America my parents sat us down and told us the\nstory of his parents. And I remember -- I don\u2019t know how my brother took it in. I have no idea\nhow he took it in. I remember going to bed at night and crying and feeling very sorry for Andy.\nMy father came in the room and said to me, just because he\u2019s your cousin doesn\u2019t mean we love\nhim less than you which I suppose it\u2019s the transverse saying it doesn\u2019t mean we love you less\nthan him. And at the time I felt very, very sad. And I always in my heart felt very sad about my\nbrother. I now have come to understand it was myself I was feeling sad for, that I was feeling\nsad for not knowing my foster parents.",
        "A: Yeah we were three months different. He was three months older. He died in 1979. He hada\nmassive heart attack. He, I feel very strongly, was a man who was plagued by what happened\nduring the war. When he knew his parents perished and he was adopted and he never, I think\nmetabolized any of that stuff. Unfortunately after the war the advice that my parents and many\npeople like them was given was one of --oh you\u2019ll love your children, you feed them, you take\ncare and everything will be okay. No one knew any different. No one knew that there was a\npsychological dimension that would come up. I think my brother stewed on this stuff for a very\nlong time. He was a ferocious smoker, nervous habit. He became a puppeteer. He had a\npuppet theater and he traveled all over the country and he settled in Tulsa Oklahoma. He was\nmarried for a while. That didn\u2019t work out. He was a hard person. I say hard in terms of\ntexture. He lived his life very hard and he was very troubled by it all and unfortunately we\ndidn\u2019t have the advantage of having some kind of therapy or having the right kind of attention\nthat we do now and I always feel bad that Andy died prematurely and that the war reached out\nand took him. When he died I had the task of calling up my parents late at night who lived in\nEurope to tell them about it. And I vowed to myself at that time that I would take care of\nmyself so that I would never have to have someone call my parents up and tell them what\nhappened. It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. Every time someone in my family dies, I feel\nit\u2019s not a matter of people passing on as nature designed it but all the memories of our losses\nand our feeling betrayed comes back. It\u2019s not just someone dying, it\u2019s the war again. And I\ndon\u2019t know how other people like myself experience that. This is my experience.",
        "A: We moved to Amsterdam. My father got work and even when my parents were hidden\nunderground they talked about they decided they were going to go to America and they were\ngoing to teach each other English which they did. They taught each other a bit of English.\nCory and Jan learned a little English. They were going to America. My family and Cory and\nJan, the people who hid them, stayed very close after the war. There are always ironies in\nhistory and one of the ironies is that, for our family, it\u2019s been a privilege and a delight to have\nhad these new people in our lives, Cory and Jan, who I\u2019ve always called Tanta Cory and Omi\nJan aunt and uncle and whom I\u2019m in touch with and very close to. When I go to Holland I see\nthem. And when I got married in 1982 they came with my parents here so that was fun. So we\nwere all very close after the war. My father went back into the restaurant business. He worked\nfor a woman whose name was De Haas who had a number of restaurants and he was her main\nmanager. She was in the camps. She survived the camps. She opened up a restaurant again. It\nwas on the Centeur Bahn in Amsterdam which was a well known shopping street. The\nrestaurant was a well- known place. But while he was working there after the war he still had\non his mind he was going to America and they did that because we have relatives here. We had\nwhat you would call a matriarch aunt, Rose, Rose Blitz Gossler who in 1945 right after the war\ncame to Holland ro see who was left who she could help. At the time there was a conversation\nbetween her and my father that when he would come to America she would help him set up in\nthe Deli business which never transpired, which became a little chicken bone 1n the throat for a\nfew years. So we had family here who sponsored us. You needed to have a sponsor, someone\nwho could swear that you would not become a ward of the state. So we sailed here on the New\nAmsterdam and came here on August 12, 1949 and I remember coming and my Aunt Rose was\nthere to greet us with some other relatives who I don\u2019t recall. And she mentioned something to\nme in English that I should run up to this guard, this police officer and say -- and I didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was and I went over and blabbed it to him and he smiled and that was it. So my first\nwords in English were a mystery to me except for the police officer. My parents very quickly\nstarted to make a life for themselves here, determined to put everything behind us. And, of\ncourse, my parents are people who have had a history before the war. They\u2019ve had a history\nthat they think of fondly and speak of fondly. So the war was an interruption, a terrible\ninterruption. For the rest of us who were younger it was our first experience in the world. We\nhad nothing to go back to, to draw from, to support us. So it was different for my parents. They\nwere able to say, let\u2019s build a life. Those of us who were younger had some real traumatic\nproblems. I understand that some -- we were in some way victims of child abuse. We were\ntraumatized children. I know from my cousin that one of my cousins had a very difficult time\nin going back with her Mom and Dad. She wanted to be back with her foster parents.",
        "A: She is two years older than me so at the time she was five. And there was an incident where I\nguess she got to be so whiny and nagging and impossible that her mother filled the suitcase, put\nit on the front steps and said, go. Get with the program or go. And the rest of us got the\nmessage; it was a very serious message. So we all got with the program. You know it\u2019s a\ncomplex thing. You wished that your parents were smarter, were wiser but they were who they\nwere and they tried their very best.",
        "A: No, I never felt estranged from my parents. The odd thing is my parents did very well by me.\nAnd I think of them very fondly; I miss my father terribly. I\u2019m sorry my mother\u2019s living in\nHolland and we can\u2019t be closer. But I know that I grew up as a very angry person. Right after\nthe war I was hospitalized. I was hospitalized. Let\u2019s see now, three months after the liberation I\nwas hospitalized for three months. I had I guess what you called chorea or what\u2019s commonly\ncalled St. Vitus Dance, I had a nervous disorder. So clearly I was paying for it. I remember\nbeing very well taken care of in the hospital. It was a Catholic hospital and I remember the\nnuns. I remember like you see on the TV program the nuns with the giant wings on their heads,\nreal nun, old world nun. I remember being very well taken care of and then when we came to\nAmerica, a few weeks after we were here my father had a serious stomach operation, ulcer. A\nfew months again I also had a nervous breakdown. So there was stuff going on. There\u2019s the\nwill to survive and get along with it and then there\u2019s the body telling you I can\u2019t take anymore.\nThere\u2019s the psyche telling you I can\u2019t take anymore. I need down time; I need time off. So I\nremember my parents doing very well by me. I\u2019m not someone who complains about my\nparents. But I also know that I grew up as a very angry young man with a terribly sarcastic\nsense of humor; always saw the dark side of things first; was very politically active in the\nsixties in the civil rights and war stuff and even in the seventies. My anger was coming from\nmy experiences as a child. I know that when I was born my mother was not able to really take\ncare of me well because she was just a wreck. People around me were a wreck filled with fear\nand dread and I must have taken that in as they say with your mother\u2019s milk even though there\nwas no mother\u2019s milk. I had taken that all in and I experienced myself as a very anxious\nperson.",
        "A: I remember only one family. It was a Hungarian family with two boys and I heard from my\nparents that they were in the war too. But there was never any talk with those families about\nthat. We played with their children. But if there were other refugee families I didn\u2019t know\nabout it. People didn\u2019t talk about it to each other. You put it behind you. You deny it; you get\non with your life. And I think now there was also a certain element of shame about it all among\nother feelings. It was like people were in the closet with their stuff. And I grew up in Beach\nHaven. I have enjoyable memories of my childhood also being a nervous kid but not a very\nintense religious quality to our family\u2019s life. We would have Passover. We would set a nice\ntable and have a wonderful meal. There was nothing said. We would celebrate Christmas. We\nhad a lot of intermarriage family which you have with Jewish families in Europe, a lot of\nintermarriage.",
        "A: They associated with their family. There was my father\u2019s brother Morritz survived Auschwitz\nand Mauthausen. These two brothers took care of each other; they survived. They paid a\nterrible price for it. They died, one of heart, one of cancer. They associated with family. They\ndidn\u2019t make friends. It was something I always found very peculiar. I suppose in Holland it\nwas that way too. There was a large family before the war; your family were your friends. My\nmother who now lives in Amsterdam in Beth Sholom which is a kind of quasi retirement home\nhas a very nice circle of about four or five women her age who have similar stories who they\u2019re\nvery close with. It\u2019s very sweet. After dinner they sit in each other\u2019s small apartments and\ntheyll watch TV and have coffee and chat. And then when it\u2019s time to go to bed they\u2019 Il kiss\neach other goodnight and they\u2019Il go to their separate homes, rooms. And it\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s not\nsomething that she had as a younger woman here. Her friends were always the other -- sister-\nin-laws. She had sister-in-law friends.",
        "A: My mother did make friends with the women in her shop. She worked in the garment trade for\nmany years, mostly Italian women. And she learned to cook very good Italian food from that\nand she speaks of it very fondly. She says the post-war years were some of the best years of her\nlife; I saw the boys grow up. We had a good time. She remembers it very fondly.",
        "A: No, I was, it\u2019s an interesting story I\u2019m glad you asked. A few months, about two or three\nmonths before it was time to have my brother and I bar mitzvahed we had a local rabbi come to\nthe house and give us rabbi lessons. And at one point, it was a very rote kind of lesson, we had\nto \u201czocher\u201d we had to remember but we didn\u2019t have to understand. So at one point we said,\nrabbi what does this mean? And he said, it doesn\u2019t matter you don\u2019t need to know, just\nremember. And I can date my alienation from Judaism from that day, from that moment. A\nvery unwise thing to say. There might have been an agenda that was just get the boys to\nremember it. Nonetheless it\u2019s not an answer I would give if I were a rabbi that\u2019s for sure. So I\nwas not a Jewish person until a few years ago when my wife took an interest in Judaism; had us\njoin a local shul because she wisely understood it was part of the process of me being\ndisaffected. At first we would go to shul just for the high holiday. I\u2019d sit in the back with my\ncoat and hat on ready to flee at any time feeling very uncomfortable always feeling like I want\nto cry. I would go to shul and feel like I want to cry. And that\u2019s the way I feel right now even\nsaying it, not feeling welcome, not feeling safe. I understand now it\u2019s not feeling safe. For us\nto identify with Judaism was to immediately putting ourselves in touch with everything that was\ndangerous to us. And I at some point regretted very much that not only had those bastards taken\nour families they now had taken our culture. And I was determined to take that culture back\nwithin the context of being a 49 year old man living in Cambridge in the latter half of the\ntwentieth century swept left and right by secular humanism, being a little bit politically leftist\nand sympathetic and liberal and feeling strongly about certain issues. Within that context I take\nback my Jewish culture.",
        "A: There is a lot of space for it. The only problem 1s we just realized we joined a rather\nconservative temple where the whole service 1s like a Polish steeplechase, you know. I\u2019m still\nreading the commentary and they\u2019re finished. So I\u2019m sort of shopping around for a little more\ncontemporary enlightened shul. Our godson who lives in North Hampton was going to be bar\nmitzvahed and I was going to be called up to read for the first time and decided well I\u2019d better\ndo this really well not to embarrass him nor myself. So Lucy and I, my wife Lucy and I a year\nbefore started taking Hebrew lessons just so we could read this. I could read this short little\nthing and took Hebrew lessons for about two and a half years so I could read Torah and know\nwhat was being said. And that kind of got us started and every Friday night Lucy and I have\nShabbat dinner and we do a blessing and when we\u2019re not too exhausted from the end of the\nweek we\u2019ll read something and have found it very important to have something that separates\nthe work week from rest, to have a moment of grace, to allow ourselves some grace even\nthough the next day, Saturday, we\u2019re still doing things we have to do. There are times where I\nfeel I\u2019d like to go to shul even though I\u2019Il sit there. I won\u2019t know what\u2019s being talked about but\nI'll sit there; P\u2019Il read the commentary. There\u2019ll be a Kiddush and I enjoy that. It\u2019s hard to lead\na Jewish life because all the issues for me. I find it very difficult.",
        "A: Yeah, the Children\u2019s Conference was the week of May 5\" 1991 and we knew about it almost a\nyear before and I thought at the time I didn\u2019t want to go to this conference. I didn\u2019t want to deal\nwith any of this stuff. And then I had started going to therapy shortly before the conference and\ntalking to my therapist about it to help me to understand that it was probably a good thing to do.\nAnd I talked with my cousins who were determined to go and I said well I'll come down to\nNew York and meet you. We can have lunch and see each other but I\u2019m not going to the\nconference. So we talked and talked and eventually I understood that it was a good thing for\nme to do. I went to the conference and it was terrific. I also sort of count for my conscious\ndepression to that time and know that my whole life I\u2019ve been depressed. But it\u2019s all very much\nopen and on the surface right now and I give it a name. It\u2019s peculiar because there are times\nwhen people will see me and they\u2019 Il say, hi Jack how are you. And the question while only a\nsecond long feels like a thousand light years which gives me enough time to think do I tell them\nhow I\u2019m really doing, do I be sociable, do I know this person well enough? Because I don\u2019t\nfeel I\u2019m doing well, you know but understand it\u2019s a social question but now there are people\nwho know my situation. I was at a dinner a month ago with some old friends and half the\npeople there were therapists. And at some point this old friend who hadn\u2019t seen me in a while\nactually a friend of my wife said, so Jack so how are you? Are you doing any good art work,\nany art, what\u2019s happening. I said, well actually I see my therapist twice a week I\u2019m very\ndepressed, the bottom of the art market has fallen and there\u2019s not much happening, and you?\nAnd there\u2019s dead silence and it\u2019s sort of like a Woody Allen scene.",
        "A: No, they invited my wife back to the chorus. It\u2019s in Brookline. There\u2019s a Brookline chorus.",
        "A: I know but you know it was important for me to say it, to give an answer not to sidestep it\nbecause for people like myself who were younger during the war the matter of having a voice is\ncrucial. And the matter of being able to feel our experience was authentic 1s crucial.",
        "A: I think that the numbers something like 25,000 people went underground and something like\n16,000 perished were betrayed being underground. The statistics are so telling. In Holland\nbefore the war you had including 25,000 Jewish German refugees you had 140,000 Jews in\nHolland. After the war you had something between 15 and 10 or 25,000, terrible attrition rate.\nIt makes me feel very badly about Europe. In the 1960\u2019s I traveled a lot to Europe. I would\nwork here for a while. \u2019'd save my money. I\u2019d go live in Europe; I\u2019'd bum around. Those were\nthe years you could do that and see Europe and I was not that aware of my feelings of all of this\nstuff but as time goes by I find myself very angry about Europe.",
        "A: We spoke both at home. I am very good with languages. I lost my accent very quickly. What\u2019s\namusing is that in being with this group of hidden children who meets -- we meet once a month\n-- 1am one of the few people who doesn\u2019t have an accent and what I enjoy is being with these\npeople because this is a circle of people I would have been in had things been better, been\ndifferent. So it gives me a sense of what it was like for my parents, for my family and I enjoy\nit. So we came here and I went to school and I had -- I want to say hello to Mrs. Harris who in\nthe third grade was so wonderful to me. She helped me to learn English. We spoke Dutch and\nEnglish at home but of course we started to speak more English. And I went back to Holland\nfor the first time in 1965 as did my parents although we went on separate trips -- we met in\nHolland but we went on our separate trips. And I ended up living in Holland for a year in 1965\nbecause I wanted to learn Dutch again. You know I studied French in school and I like\nlanguages and I wanted to do that. But as to the matter of Dutch identity it\u2019s very complex for\nme because being a European American I like that I have -- whatever it means to be a European\nJew I like that because it gives me a certain perspective about what it means to live in America\nin this time in history. On the other hand I find some of the presumptuousness and arrogance of\nthe Europeans about America really shallow and I\u2019ve always sort of understood America is the\nEuropean peasant\u2019s dream come true. And the only difference between America and Europe is\nmaybe a hundred years. But the more I\u2019m in touch with what I feel about my experiences the\nless happy I am with Europe. I feel we have been wretchedly betrayed.",
        "A: My parents never -- we never talked about 1n such a national context of saying Europe betrayed\nus. It was Germany, it was Hitler, 1t was Dutch collaborators. But you can take any country in\nEurope and it happened. What I also find interesting is that what the European Christian\ncommunity is something that the Europeans have been doing to people of color all over the\nworld for a few hundred years. What the Germans did in southwest Africa, what the Dutch did\nin Indonesia and what the Belgians did in the Congo, what the English did and what the French\ndid they did it to everybody else who was different. And when it happened in their own\nhomeland all of a sudden it became a terrible dark enigma about Hitler and Hitlerism and I\nreally do attribute it -- the little that I know about history -- that it was a European phenomenon\nand the groundwork was laid by the church, by the Christian church. And I mean people have\nto own up to that, they have to own up to that.\n9",
        "A: Well actually it does in so far as that my art has nothing to do with my experience. My art is a\ncomplete denial of my experience and it is such an enigma to me. My artistic voice does not in\nany way include my experience and I see that as a function of denial. It perplexes me. And\nsometimes, you know some morning II] wake up and say boy I wish I could really express all\nthat stuff in my art. But then I think of oh well but then I would be so literal, literal or pedantic\nor rhetorical and I don\u2019t want to be that. It\u2019s not what I draw on for my art. My art what I draw\non is from my beauty, my love of beauty, the love of what\u2019s beautiful in the world, the love of\nwhat\u2019s beautiful between people. I also think there are aesthetic problems with dealing with\nhorrors of such magnitude and I\u2019m not the person to do it so I leave it alone.",
        "A: Yes, well I have looked -- there\u2019s a book of art from Auschwitz, things that were painted on\nwalls and I\u2019m absolutely struck by how powerful it is. It\u2019s different than people today who will\nmake art that\u2019s about that. It does not strike a chord in me. I also in some way -- Elie Wiesel\ntalks somehow about that you can\u2019t make art out of it, how in some way it\u2019s so inexplicable that\nall art will fall short and I think even successful Holocaust Shoah art falls short. To maintain a\ncertain kind of integrity 1t would have to, it would have to. And I always felt for myself that art\nis about redemption and I don\u2019t think......\nA; No, it\u2019s not idealistic. It\u2019s as I think that the way in which the creative process functions in each\nof us. You draw on aspirations, you draw on hope, you draw on a sense of all things in their\nconnectedness rather than being dispert. And you look for the sacred, what\u2019s sacred in life.\nThis is I think what motivates art and other people of course have another sense of it. And for\nnow the Shoah is I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a place for redemption right now. I mean I understand\nthat in our group that we meet once a month we have been talking about among other things\nabout how civilization has a need to deny and has a need to forget. It\u2019s a shameful period and it\nneeds to forget and it will do this in many ways. One way will be the most banal expression of\npeople who absolutely deny it happened. Then there is the matter of having perpetrators and\nvictims be seen as equivocal in some way sort of like the Blitburg visit. We\u2019re all victims of\nwar. Well that\u2019s so but that\u2019s beside this point and that over time who knows how the story of\nthis thing will be told. We can witness the experience of the African Americans in this country,\nthe horror of that and how that\u2019s already been glossed over. And I think that civilizations have a\nneed to forget their shame and this is why I insist upon telling my story and say yes to being\ninterviewed to anyone who\u2019s willing to listen.",
        "A: Well I can tell you some things about them relative to the war experiences that are interesting in\nterms of personality. One is that my mother talks of having found my father so very appealing\nwhen they were younger because he was a quiet fellow and she liked that about him. It turns\nout that during the war he went through this personality change and he became a gregarious\nchatty chap. He\u2019s a man who loved to talk to strangers as I am and he was very sociable, he\nwas fun, he was easy to get along with. So he went through a real personality change. My\nmother is more of a worrier. She does the worrying for us and it\u2019s sort of an unfair\nresponsibility I think. It\u2019s enough to be a mother but then to have to do the worrying. And she -\n- well it\u2019s hard to really talk about her without defaming her.",
        "A: Yes. Well you know we accept our mothers and fathers as gods and forget that they are\nbeautifully human. What can I say about my parents? I don\u2019t really know except that I know in\nAmerica my father worked very hard. I'd see him come home and after dinner he\u2019d sit on a\nstool in front of the TV and within five minutes he was asleep, he was out. On Sundays he\nwould go with the other men in the family and sometimes some of the boys. then we would go\nwatch the soccer games. All the ethnic clubs in New York City played soccer with each other\nand we\u2019d do that. And they belonged to the Holland-American sporting club which would have\na New Year\u2019s party. Which would have functions, events. So they kept within their Dutch\ncircle. Any friends that they made outside of the family were still Dutchmen. In some ways I\nregret that they did not branch out more.",
        "A: Yes, you know I experienced my father as a very ordinary person and I don\u2019t mean that\n\u201cordinaire\u201d. I mean just -- he was just a person. But he 1s very creative in life. In the short haul\nhe\u2019s very creative. When a crisis would come up he would be real quick and he would be really\non the case and I know when he and my mother went underground my mother did most of the\nhemming and hawing of course. I say of course, I don\u2019t know. And he had to really convince\nher as well as her brother\u2019s letter that said don\u2019t bring the red baby carriage -- had to convince\nher they had to do it. So she would do a lot of hemming and hawing but she\u2019s a very expressive\nperson. My mother is the one who I\u2019ve done much of my talking with. We are both connected\nvery emotionally in that way. It\u2019s been troublesome as well because of that. My father P\u2019ve\nexperienced a little more distantly. Guess it\u2019s very typical in that way. I always experienced\nthem both as being very supportive but there are things I never really got into with my father\nthat I would get into with my mother. My mother would have wonderful provocative arguments\nand she was the more expressively emotional one.",
        "A: My parents in the family have had a good reputation, very good reputation. When I talk with\nmy cousins and they talked about my parents they always talked about how friendly and sweet\nand thoughtful they were. And this is how I\u2019ve experienced them, as a thoughtful people who\nwere very practical at life and also had placed a premium on being a decent person. There was\na clear message about you had to be an ethical person.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, sixteen, seventeen on. You know you\u2019re in a particular class and your social life at that\ntime was very much involved in political groups, the young people\u2019s socialist league or\nsomething like that. And what it meant was it provided a social life with a kind of minimal\npolitical context for young people and sometimes it would serve the purpose of grooming more\nseriously politically committed people. But it was also neighborhood stuff, it was\nneighborhood stuff. My parents lived with a lot of relatives as did many people then and they\nenjoyed that . They did a lot of their playing and socializing with those cousins.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see now, no, I know that during the war my father got involved in marquetry, wood\nmarquetry. During the thirties in Europe it was very popular. You\u2019d get marquetry sets. Like\nlet\u2019s say here its Scrabble or hula-hoop which dates me. But there it was marquetry and during\nthe war Jan Van Nomberg and my father managed to get hold of these marquetry sets and make\nthese little pictures. They were copies of famous old masters and my mother has my dad\u2019s. It\u2019s\nin my dowry. I get 1t when it\u2019s my turn and it\u2019s a replication of a famous Vermeer painting of the\nhouse where Vermeer lived and it\u2019s remarkable because the brick is all these small pieces of\nwood and the mortar in between are all these tiny, tiny little splints of pieces of wood. They did\nthis during the war when they were underground to keep themselves from going cuckoo. I\ndon\u2019t know of any other habit, hobbies my father had. My mother liked to sing when she was\nyounger. I know I grew up loving opera and I attribute that to her. These people worked a lot.\nThe message here was work, work so.... And I am an artist and that\u2019s my work and other people\nwould consider that a hobby so what other people would consider a hobby I took on as a major -\n- aS an occupation.",
        "A: Well at the expense of sounding whiny, I would say that my family like many, many people got\nscrewed by Europe and we came here in 1949 and my parents had to start from scratch again\nand never could quite build it up to where they had in Holland. They worked very hard in\nHolland and they did well for themselves. And I do marvel actually at my parents the ability to\ngo into hiding, provide for themselves and survive. When I was in my teens and going through\nmy rebellion I pooh-poohed my parents. What did they know? I knew much more than they\ndid. And now, of course, I think what a little snot-nose I was to think that. They had to live\nthrough and make life decisions through something I have not had to and hope to God I and no\none else will ever have to make. And they were ordinary people, simple people and they rose to\nthe occasion and the people that hid them were ordinary human beings and they rose to the\noccasion. Those were the heroes. My parents were the heroes. The people that hid them were\nthe heroes. And the stories they tell of what they did during the war to survive 1s remarkable.\nMy mother taught Cory how to sew. What they did -- they would get clothing and they would\ntake it apart and remake things out of it and they would sell or exchange that for foodstuffs.\nAnd when my parents were hidden underground no one on the street in the town, of course,\nknew they were being hidden. The parents of Cory knew but not her younger brother. It was\ntoo dangerous to let people know. And Jan would get food. He had those wide pants at the\ntime, very wide flair pants, very popular then, like bell-bottoms in some way and they sewed\nthese cloth bags to the inside of their pants that they would fill with foodstuffs and he would\nbicycle home with them. They also had to be careful because they couldn\u2019t trade for food that\nwould be evident that there was more than two people in the household eating so it had to be all\ndone in different places and as my mother tells it they were never hungry during the war. They\nalways had enough foodstuffs. And she would take great pleasure going down to the cellar and\nlooking at the shelves and seeing what food they were able to store.",
        "A: It is interesting. I know I lived on a farm from 1977 to 1980. Actually I did farming in New\nEngland from 1973 to 1980 when I lived with someone and we raised, we had a milk cow, we\nraised hogs, we raised chickens, we raised sheep, we raised a lot of our own foodstuffs. And I\nwould go down to the cellar and I would put up forty quarts of applesauce, sixty quarts of\ntomatoes, freezer filled with meat, freezer filled with vegetables, cords of wood stacked up --\nvery New England. And I would go look at all this and stand there like a proud man with my\nhand in my suspenders looking at it and not at the time understanding what was going on was\nsome kind of replication of some need that my parents went through. My parents went back to\nHolland in 1972 because they wanted to retire and they could do it there rather than here and it\nwas also the year that I went to live in Vermont during the summer and ended up staying there\nand ended up actually having left New York City and shortly after ended up in a farm situation\nand I do wonder now how I[ had replicated my war experiences. In a way it makes me feel very\nbad that my agenda was so unconscious that my going into this farm and farming was a matter\nof going into hiding. I had a big beard, I had long hair, I looked very different than I do now. I\nwas in hiding and it makes m feel very badly that I still had to act this out and it happened at the\nsame time as my parents decided to go back to Europe and again it was a kind of a split with my\nfamily, a separation. I understand it now.\ndecided to continue this interview after all?",
        "A: Yes. I want to read this little piece, that is what my wife and I translated from my mother\u2019s\njournal that she spent seven years writing about her and the family\u2019s wartime experience. And\nwhat\u2019s interesting is she has said that in writing this it made her feel much better. She\u2019s really\nthe only one in her family that even talks about this stuff. For years my brother and I even after\nwe moved out of our parents\u2019 home when we\u2019d come home to visit would ask them about the\nwar. And inevitably every time we got together the conversation would come back to that and\nthere were questions. My brother and I always had to ask questions. At one point we finally\ndecided let\u2019s get Mom a tape recorder and see if she\u2019d really do this. And she did. And she\nspent seven years writing this stuff down. And it was done without a typewriter, without a\npersonal computer, just by hand. And she got so involved with it that when Cory wanted to go\nout with her shopping or something Celene wouldn\u2019t go. She really wanted to do this and\ncomplete it and as I said she felt in a way that a burden was taken off her chest. There\u2019s one\nlittle piece I want to read that could give you an idea of what it was like at the time that my\nparents made the decision to go underground and to provide and look for a place for me. On the\nfifteenth of November Eddie (which was my mother\u2019s other brother) visited us with great\nsadness because of what had happened to Father, Mother and our brother Jack. During this visit\nhe told us he had an underground address for Dad and myself and a separate one for you, Jack.\nIt\u2019s written for you because this whole manuscript was written for my brother and myself. So\nthat\u2019s the form it takes. Very distressed with the idea of parting from our baby, Eddie tried to\nconvince us that your chances, Jack were better without us. If we were captured he explained at\nleast you might survive. He also knew it would be easier to find a separate place for a couple\nwithout children. They would not bring to the underground family the additional burden and\nsecurity risk of children crying or needing medical attention and such. All night Eddie talked\nwith us. What an extraordinary demand -- give up our three month old child to perfect strangers\nand without opportunities to visit. We had no idea how long such an arrangement would have\nto last, a month, half a year, longer, who knew. The next day we talked with my brother Maritz.\nIn the serious way that\u2019s so typical of him he asked Dad and me to consider the following\n: Imagine the German police catching you, he said, this could happen at any moment. The\nbaby will fall into their hands. Wouldn\u2019t you rather have a child with Ollie and me (Ollie was\nhis wife) until Eddie takes them to a hiding place? Dad and I found a lot of truth in what he\nsaid. Here was a chance so many people wanted but had no opportunity of getting. How could\nwe pass it up. We felt that no matter what we did we would be doomed if we didn\u2019t do\nanything. Already the families of several of our brothers and sisters had been torn apart by\narrests and deportations. A few months ago, Case, the husband of Dad\u2019s sister, Bepe, had been\ntaken to Camp Westerbork leaving Bepe at home alone with their two year- old daughter.\nWesterbork was located in Northern Holland and the Jews were sent from there to the different\nconcentration camps, Auschwitz, Sobibor. Maritz Trompettor, who was my father\u2019s brother,\nhad been in the same camp for half a year by then. His wife, Femma and their daughters were\nstill at home. The children\u2019s home in which Femma worked was soon seized by the SS and the\nGreen Police. They captured the Jewish infants and sent them with their mothers to be gassed\nor destroyed in one way or another. But Femma protected herself and her daughters and then\nfound underground addresses for each of them. This is my Aunt Femma who died a year ago.\nShe was very active in finding hiding places for children. She was a very brave and very strong\nand feisty woman. The thing is many people were brave and feisty and strong and everything\nbut in some way it was luck. It was luck that you survived but it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that\nyou were lucky or that being lucky meant you were better than anyone else. My brother Maritz\nand his family were still intact and living at the Transvaalstraat. My mother\u2019s brother Maritz\nwas born in England because his parents took a trip to England and he was born there so he had\ndual citizenship. He had British and Dutch citizenship. He eventually ended up in Bergen-\nBelsen but Belsen was not an extermination camp and because he was a British citizen they\ndidn\u2019t kill him. It also allowed for his wife Ollie to bring food packages to him which helped\nhim to survive. Eddie, another brother, because he was involved with the resistance moved\naround from one temporary hiding place to another. He never went permanently underground.\nIndeed with his pure blue eyes and curly blond hair he thought he would be taken for a German\nrather than a Dutch Jew. Brazen as he was he had been riding trains filled with Germans and\nthese experiences gave him this idea. Of course he did not know that in time he would be the\nvictim of betrayal. He was betrayed. My close friend Marie which is my brother\u2019s/cousin\u2019s\nmother which is Andy\u2019s mother, another of Dad\u2019s sisters was still at home with her husband,\nCheel and their six month old infant Andy. Like us they lived with all the worries and fears of\nkeeping Andy out of the hands of the pack of thieves. By now Dad\u2019s other sister, Judith, her\nhusband and their four year old daughter Laney had been underground for three months. With\ngreat difficulty and sadness we struggled over our decision to go into hiding. There was not\neven a guarantee that all would go well underground. Inasmuch as no guarantee was to be\nfound with any choice we made we finally decided to go ahead with Eddie\u2019s plan. He promised\nthat within a week we would be told all the details. This was the best of the worst of situations.\nMaritz\u2019s wife Ollie also had to agree with the arrangement because she would be also\nresponsible for caring for our son, me. No one knew for how long. It could take two days, it\ncould take a month. But Ollie agreed without talking to us. It was good enough for her that my\nbrothers wanted it. We have always been grateful to her. Ollie died two and a half months ago\nand I wrote her daughter and her step-daughters a letter saying something like this about what a\ndecent person she was and how we owe our thanks to her and I wrote this letter as -- 1t was\nostensibly a condolence letter but I wanted to say something to her daughters about what a fine\nperson she was. We cared a great deal for our family. Sisters, brothers and children were heavy\non our hearts and particularly the old people. What did one do with the old people. Grandma\nand Grandfather Trompettor were still living at home. They were fortunate for the moment\nbecause Shuls, one of their sons, one of my father\u2019s brothers, and his family lived nearby\nallowing them to help his parents through thick and thin. But with his loving attention to them\nand his recent service period away from home (he had to serve in the army) he hadn\u2019t been able\nto find an underground address. The old people understood that for them life was finished. One\nsees this now on the photographs taken of them for their identity papers. Even if they went\nunderground, which seldom happened, their chance for survival was very slim. As long as the\nwar continued it became clear to them that they would eventually be left by themselves, most\nlikely never again to be with the people they so dearly loved. Often enough there was talk of\nthe underground and so with great grief they began to live with it (meaning the children going\nunderground). Thus was something we simply could not continue to think about. If one\nbecame too sensitive and afraid then one might let an opportunity go by. We grew resolute. We\ndid not tell anyone about our plan other than Father and Mother Trompettor. You, Jack and I\nhad recently visited them and I did not expect them to say goodbye to us again. From their\ngestures at our departure I saw that for them it was a real goodbye, not just a good-day until the\nnext time. Clearly they suspected something. Every evening for years Dad visited them for a\nfew minutes. Now he went to tell them of our decision. How does one present such a sad\nprospect. Like their other children we too kept the details for ourselves for the sake of security.\nYou took nobody into your confidence. This was what the bad society had made of us. Later as\nit turned out all those who were still at home except for Uncles Jules eventually went\nunderground but it consoled us little to learn that we were not the only ones who had to leave\nparents. This is a very telling piece which always perplexes me. For me the leaving was not so\ndifficult because my parents were not here anymore. This is my mother talking because her\nparents were already taken away. What I have left if they were still at home. Dad asked\nhimself this question. No good answer was found. Today, forty years later, I do not think I\nwould have made this choice again. The twentieth of November 1942 arrives. It is early in the\nmorning and I am home alone when Eddie comes to our apartment. We must be ready before\neight o\u2019clock that night, he says, to begin with the first part of our journey into hiding. As we\nhad originally agreed he himself--------- (let\u2019s see if I can find the other piece of that). Eddie\nhimself would bring us. Everything was planned that way. Jackie, that\u2019s me, would be picked\nup by my brother Maritz at seven o\u2019clock in the evening and from thereon a place would be\nfound in the children\u2019s house in Neimachen. This was just as Eddie said it would happen from\nthe agreed upon plans made earlier on. We were expected to pay 300 guilder a month to the\nchildren\u2019s house. We did just this even though in this time this amount of money was a large\namount for working class people. It was organized so that we would have a particular amount\nwith us and Eddie would hold on to the rest. In case something went wrong with us there\nwould still be enough money for a definite time to pay the kinder house. In the beginning we\ncould know if we had enough money or not for the duration of the war. We naively thought it\nwould be possible. As I have said as soon as I knew the plan that morning Chait ver Kike the\nneighbor and I delivered our household goods to her apartment with the help of her husband.\nThis is a neighbor who was very friendly with my parents who agreed to buy their furniture so\nmy parents could raise money and they knew what was going on. When you went underground\nand you left you couldn\u2019t leave abruptly because then immediately someone would be on your\ntail so my parents planned this over time so they could slowly leave.. They would leave\nsomeone paying some of their bills and it would be months before it was realized that they were\ngone. And my mother has often talked about how she felt she had to be like a criminal. She\nhad to think like a criminal because the law was in the hands of the criminals. She as an\nordinary person had to think like that to survive. Dad was quickly warned at work I do not\nknow by whom. At four o\u2019clock he came home which was very unusual for Thursday when he\nusually came home about eight o\u2019clock or later. He just told his boss he had to go away for a\nlittle while. Because it was so busy on Thursdays this boss told him to be quick and come back\nas soon as possible but Dad knew better. He then went for the last time to his mother and father\nwho were in a dejected mood and not without reason. They had just before found out that their\ndaughter Judith, her husband and child, Yope and Laney were betrayed and handed over to the\nGermans. We will never know if the Trompettor grandparents knew that Laney was in fact still\nwith her benefactor having gotten away from her executioners. This is my cousin Laney who\nlives in Holland. I\u2019m almost absolutely certain they did not know otherwise we would have\nheard it from Uncle Jules. For Dad at the moment while this was indeed a grim message he\ntried not to be disheartened. On the contrary this news of his sister strengthened him in his\nresolve to go into hiding. In answer to your question about their character. You never really\nknow the full depth I suppose of your character until something extraordinarily intervenes and\nthen if you\u2019re lucky you rise to the occasion. Dad also told his parents what we were going to\ndo that night but what could these poor people do but accept our leaving them. This was the\nlast time that Dad was ever again to be with his parents. Here was the new episode between\nparents and children finished under the saddest of circumstances. Still to come were many\nmore moments of separation. Dad came home and told me that what he had just learned from\nhis parents about his sister and her family. I felt very sad but now realized that we had come\nthis far and we definitely had to continue with our plans, the sooner the better. And this of\ncourse then is my mother\u2019s moment when she too becomes resolute. We ate something and got\ndressed as if we were going out. We put on our best clothing because you never knew. Seven\no\u2019clock in the evening November 20, 1942 my brother Maritz came to take Jackie away. What\na moment. Would we ever see you again? We embraced you; it had to be. It was for us to say\nthe least the only chance. We had to try but how do you do something like that. Who gives you\nthe strength to hand over your three month old child a bundle that you love so much and have\nlearned every gesture in those three months. When we gave you to Uncle Maritz Zomerplaag\nwe knew there would be a place prepared for you in the Catholic children\u2019s home. Later as it\nturned out we found out it was a non-denominational. It was a Quaker house where the director\ntook in various children but mostly those in Catholic families. My brother Eddie found that he\nmade more of an impression on us when he said it was a children\u2019s home. I surmised this at the\ntime. It did indeed make a better impression on us. Eddie said that it would still take a few\ndays before there would be a permanent place for you there. Later we learned that those few\ndays turned into a month but it was a good thing that we didn\u2019t know that at the time. In those\nfour weeks of waiting you were almost a fatality. I will return to this later. (This is where I\ntalked about that). It\u2019s remarkable to me. It helps to explain what I feel about my anxiety and\ninsecurity in the world that as a baby I took in all this near destruction of stuff and from what\nwe know now about children take in the world. It was our wish to survive this drama with Jack\nback with us. Therefore it was necessary to arrive at our destination safely. This wish was for\nus so strong and so consumed us that it became for us the strength needed to give you over to\nfulfill this unbelievable and horribly sad task. Without exaggeration from that moment on we\nthought about you every day. I would like to read a little bit more. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a......",
        "A: Okay. I read this to give you a sense possibly of what it was like for my parents and for me and\nwhat people lived with. Now we were again alone without you.. What torment. Do not think\nthat it is easy to write about this now. To imagine that so many parents had to go through the\nsame and even worse including Marie Cheel. When they had to take you, Andy, with the best of\nintentions of getting you back. Where your parents brought you we did not know. This was\nlogical since we were already underground. Later I will write about some of the details, our\ndear departed son. My mother finished this -- was writing the story at the time my brother died\nso it changes-- what do we call that the transitive.....?",
        "A: The tense, the transitive chicken, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, yes. As soon as Maritz took Jackie out of the house we too went on our way to the Umstel\ntrain station just as we had planned. This took ten minutes. We closed the door on the largest\npart of our household\u2019s possessions and most of our clothing. Obviously they must not have\nhad their yellow star on because they could not have been out. In the meantime Dad had left a\nhalf-year\u2019s rent money behind with our landlord. The landlord knew we were going away but\nnot when. If this helped us we don\u2019t know. It did give us the idea that we would say the lease\nnot be looked at for six months although certainly not out of dispute with the landlord although\nbetrayal or discovery was always naturally a possibility. In any case later on we heard of the\nfirst raid of our apartment and that it was sealed up by the Germans. Thus we were not searched\nfor in the first raid. From this we conclude that paying the landlord that way we did serve our\npurposes well. I would like to read about when my father found me. I feel I need to have my\nvoice back again. That\u2019s the problem with this. My brother and I were instrumental in getting\nmy mother to do this and it means a lot to me and I\u2019m very pleased she did it but in reading it, it\nalso pushes my button about what about me -- now. Dad felt it was now time for him to begin\nhis own search for you. We are reading now about the part where my parents have been\nliberated and my parents decide to look for the children, to look for whatever children are still\nalive. We had no idea how to do it. We had no guidance but our patience was up and we could\nnot wait for information that would inform us about what happened with you and Andy.\nBecause of the behavior of your step parents we later understood that they would not take any\naction making known that during the war-time they had hidden a child. Many people like them\nwere attached to the children in their care, very understandable. The family De Chot presumed\nthat Dad and I were no longer alive. We now know that in our situation regarding you that you\nwould have then been returned to us. What happened during the war too is people did get\nattached to their children and there were many legal cases in Holland after the war where the\nfamilies who survived had to go to court to get the children back. The nature of some of these\ncases is very telling about Dutch ethics because after the war the way people survived was\nthrough the black market. There was no doubt about it, that\u2019s how you survived. My mother\nfeels embarrassed about it. She thinks it\u2019s shameful. She prefers I not saying anything about it\nbut the fact is that\u2019s how people survived. Gentile families who did not want to return their\nJewish children would often use that as an argument why the parents were not responsible\nparents and could not have the children back and in many cases did not get the children back\nbecause of that. Many of the people who hid the children also had a religious agenda. They felt\nthey needed to convert these children and it wasn\u2019t always a self-serving sentiment. It was also\nthe sentiment of how to save the children. To convert them would be to save them, so it was\nmixed. The reason there was a high percentage of Dutch Jewish children who were able to go\nunderground was because to save the people of the Book would be considered a mitzvah. The\nJews were known as the people of the Book and for many of the Protestants in Holland they\ntook their bible literally, it\u2019s interesting. With Andy it would have turned out differently\nbecause his parents were no longer alive. More about that later. Dad didn\u2019t want to wait any\nmore while the information just dribbled in and as I said went out on his own. After enquiring\nhe found out where to go to the military authorities and get a special pass that allowed him to\nhitch rides on military transport. There was no other transport at the time. You didn\u2019t have\nbuses, you didn\u2019t have subways, you didn\u2019t have zip. This meant only army vehicles. The fact\nis there simply wasn\u2019t any other transport yet. Still this meant quite a bit. Again Dad left the\nhouse with nothing but a little money for necessities which themselves weren\u2019t easy to buy.\nThe military authorities gave Dad very good advice. The told him he must begin his search\nnorth of the rivers because Holland is in the middle divided by a bunch of rivers. Because there\nwas known that in the province Overeisel there were children who had been bought for hiding\nso the story goes light haired children above the rivers which wasn\u2019t true of you at all. What\nCelene is talking about is that the people who hid children during the war had a policy that dark\nhaired Jewish children would go to the south of Holland where most of the people were\nCatholic and were darker and the lighter skinned, lighter haired Jewish people would go to the\nnorth because there were Protestants who were lighter. So Dad began with the purpose in front\nof his eyes, good or bad from one empty army truck or another finally ending up in the city of\nNaivadol in Overeisel. We had never heard of this place before. Once in Naivadol Dad\nimmediately went to City Hall. There he spoke to several bureaucrats. One of them, Mr.\nBucker, sent Dad on the way to Mrs. De Fries Andy\u2019s foster mother on the large street in\nNaivadol. The man knew that there was a young boy that had been hidden. When he arrived at\nMrs. De Fries\u2019s home Dad was allowed in and saw to his stunned surprise a little boy of whom\nhe though thought this could well be Andy, his nephew. He had the family face and the age was\nalso right. Dad spoke with Mrs. De Fries. He explained his relationship telling her his name\nwhich at the moment was unknown to her. After a while and for different reasons she\nunderstood that Dad was the brother of the mother of this child who she had taken over under\nher protection and who she was very fond of. Dad was very lucky to have found Andy. For\nMrs. De Fries this was not a happy day. Dad could see that it would not be easy to get Andy\nfrom her but that\u2019s a tale apart. It got to be late in the day and thus Dad was invited to supper\nand slept there. The few hours that were left Dad played with Andy. Andy sat on Dad\u2019s lap and\nbegan to play with his ear lobe. This was a habit that Dad\u2019s younger brother Yope one out of\neight brothers and sisters always did as a little kid. Mr. Bucker from City Hall also knew to tell\nDad that a few kilometers between Naivadol and the town of Chaino stood an old small farm\nwhere there was also a young boy brought underground. He suggested that Dad should check\nthis farm out because that in any event he left Mrs. De Fries and planned to return for Andy.\nShe actually didn\u2019t give Dad any indication that she understood that she had to be separated\nfrom Andy at some point in the future. Dad departed from Andy with mixed feelings from this\ncomplicated situation. It was early in the morning when Dad continued his search for you. He\nhad to travel the long kilometers on foot. He often said to me how he walked and walked and in\nthe evening dead tired arrived somewhere on the side of a road in the village of Chaino. He\nrang the bell of the farm. It was already dark and about ten o\u2019clock. He waited for someone to\nanswer the door which didn\u2019t happen right away. They were people who were used to going to\nbed early and they were by then fast asleep. Dad kept ringing the bell and finally a man stuck\nhis head out of the attic window and asked what was going on. In the hope that the sound of a\nchild crying was your crying Dad screwed up his courage to begin a conversation with this man.\nHe told the man who he was and why he had come. They didn\u2019t plan to open the door right\naway answering Dad. The child\u2019s parents died and that\u2019s why we took him through the\nintervention of our pastor. At this point Dad asked to be let in, in any case. He wanted them to\nknow who he was by comparing something he had with him. Oh I guess from reading this I see\nthat they brought me to him that evening. I thought that he slept over. Dad was allowed in and\nright away showed the man a lamb\u2019s wool baby shirt because a similar one had been left with\nthe baby boy when he was sent underground. This was from the lamb\u2019s wool bathing suit that\nthey had made. The organization that provided contact with underground hiding places had told\nthe family to save it in case the child had to be brought to another place. Luckily in your\nsituation this advice was heeded. After comparing the two pieces this was evidence enough that\nthe truth was being spoken here. Only then did they bring you forth, a crying young boy of\nabout two years old. Dad saw in the blink of an eye that 1t was his son. What a moment it must\nhave been. It was and is to value how these people didn\u2019t clam up but in one night were made\n100% certain before believing something of the parental bond that was being talked about here.\nThis is understandable. Here I could write some things but that I won\u2019t and don\u2019t want to. Pll\nleave that to imagination. The truth is I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about here and I'd really\nbe curious. What Dad told me about this after he took you in his arms that is not to be\ndescribed except by Dad himself. And so that was the first contact for Dad with the family who\nplayed a large role in your and our lives. After an emotional discussion Dad was allowed to\nsleep there overnight. You and the family slept upstairs while Dad was given a hay mattress\nand a small room downstairs. From everything that Dad could see these people were very\nsimple farmers, in fact poor people who notwithstanding the poverty knew how to hold\nthemselves together. The family consisted of a sixty five year old man who looked like he was\neighty. His wife who was also in her sixties wore a wig which was very unusual in those years.\nThey had an unmarried son who was about twenty eight years old who could be mistaken for\nforty and an unmarried young daughter. When I saw them later I could see that they were a\nvery stiff but decent people. When she says stiff she means that they were Dutch Reformed,\nvery conservative. The people were as good for you as they could be because with them there\nwas also great hunger which was readily apparent. They had one horse and a few chickens left\nover. The woman told Dad that her man still had to work on the land for other farmers. For this\nhe would every day get a plate of oatmeal and once in a while an egg. You Jack, would sit by\nhim and he would share his oatmeal and egg with you. Mrs. De Chot told how she took apart\none of her bedspreads and used the thread to make a coverall for you because all of your clothes\nwere too small. She also said she cut the tips of your shoes off so that they would still fit.\n(Laughter) Remarkable. You know I haven\u2019t read this in a few years. This can be seen from a\nphoto that she made of you, her son and herself. When I look at the photo and when I had first\nseen it I had the impression that she had made this coverall for the occasion of the photograph\nfor which she derived great pleasure. I\u2019ve never seen this photo. Not knowing that she would\nhave to give you up. Later at our first meeting she said that she never would have given you up\nhad it not been your real parents who claimed you. She had planned to have you baptized but\nour appearance had prevented this. Too bad I would have been covered there too. There was no\ndoubt at all that these people were very fond of you and the son played the role of father even\nmore so than the older man. This became quite clear later on. The family came out of a\nReform Protestant background. They were very formal and lived just like Mrs. De Fries with\nher bible on the table. Almost everybody in Overeisel lived like this. I just want to interrupt\nthis reading by saying something that I have found out in the last half a year that there was in\nfact a group in Holland, there was a group of young people, 17, 18, 19, 20 who were\ninstrumental in providing hiding places for Jewish children like myself and this group was\ncalled the NV which literally translated means the unknown holding company, the anonymous\nholding company which is a wonderful surrealistic title I think. And my cousin Yanika from\nCalifornia has been receiving this information and recently sent me an article about an older\nman who is very pivotal in this group who was captured and killed and in the article there is a\nlist of children\u2019s names of their name, the date they were born and where they were hidden and\nmy name is in there and I saw it and it was a remarkable experience to get this. I called my\ncousin Yanika and I said to her I got this, this is wonderful. And she says to me what did you\nfeel like when you saw your name? And I said well the truth is I felt wonderful. It confirms all\nthese things and I said and how did you feel and she said well I wept and I wept and I wept.\nShe is 57 so she\u2019s older than me and she remembers our grandparents. She remembers going\nout every day when she was hidden underground waiting for her parents to come back so she\nhas that experience. But for me it was a remarkable experience to see my name Isaac\nTrompettor and then Overeisel which is the province where I was and then a question mark next\nto Overeisel that may mean we don\u2019t know where in Overeisel. It was a stunning experience\nfor me to see that and it was all the result of me spending the last years of searching this out. I\nknow my parents were very resistant to that for a long time and I feel very vindicated that I\npursued this and stayed with it, that I got this. It\u2019s very important to me. I would emphatically\nencourage other people who have similar or like stories to do that. When you do find out real\ndocumented pieces of what you\u2019ve always heard in your family it\u2019s emotionally very fulfilling\nand powerful.\nA? Sure. Ill just read this last page. In the few days that it was necessary for Dad to stay there,\nthere was so much conversation from which Dad had heard that in the beginning there was also\nanother young boy about twelve years old who they also hid. Mrs. De Chot had noticed that\nwhen she was away and came home to you, you were crying and the young boy had frightened\nyou and the crying got worse instead of better. It turned out that he would light the stove and\nput me head first into the stove, this boy. I\u2019d rather not believe it but it was enough for them to\nbring this boy somewhere else because they wanted to keep you. So I can imagine seeing this\nother young Jewish kid who was out of his mind and took it out on me. He had to go\nsomewhere else and who knows what happened to this boy. I think this accounts for some of my\nhaving a nervous breakdown after the war, being fricasseed. Now it was time for Dad to figure\nout how to come home. He knew that I didn\u2019t know what was going on nor did he have an\nopportunity to inform me. You know there were no phones then that were working. The next\nmorning Dad went to the church, spoke with the pastor. What Dad told him was sufficient\nenough for Dad to take you without any official authorization. The church had a lot of\ninfluence with people. You could go to the church and make it clear to them you were the\nparent and the church would go to the people and talk to them and convince them. From there\nwe went to the local military authority who provided him with a transportation pass so that\nwhen transport went south both of you could go on it. It took four\nThat's my Mom.jpgThat's my Mom.jpgdays before an empty truck came your way. Those\nfour days were actually very necessary because you two got to know each other. The morning\nwhen the truck arrived Dad and you left for Tilburg promising the De Chots to keep in touch\nand he would let them know how you were doing. Naturally we kept our word. We did. We\nwere in touch and visited those people up until we went to America. It was also the time at least\naccording to my parents that they got to be very pushy and obnoxious about wanting to convert\nme. I suspect that this was not entirely so and maybe what my parents had to flush out in order\nto make the necessary separation from these people. I mean it\u2019s complex and subtle stuff with\nthis last little chapter. What Dad clearly remembers about this trip was that as long as the ride\ntook, you sat in your wet pants on his lap and he got wet, too. You also cried often during the\ntrip. How could it be otherwise sitting in the back for hours with the feeling of wet pants, no\nfood or drink, as well as the crowding of many other people around you. While you possibly\nhad been so used to the quiet all of a sudden such a huge change. I have often thought about\nthis especially if I had been the one to carry you instead of Dad. I have also often thought about\nhow I would have felt if I had been the one to see you first at the De Chots. To understand that\nI could see you in front of me to spoil you and take you with me. What would that have felt\nlike? This will always be a question. The other question that should always be a question and\nunfortunately didn\u2019t get addressed in our family was what was it like for me to be adopted by\nmy parents. Powerful stuff.\n"
