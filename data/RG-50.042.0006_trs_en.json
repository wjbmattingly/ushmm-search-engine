        "I want you to first describe for me how your everyday life changed when the Germans came into\nPoland, and, especially when they came to your area.",
        "You mean 1939? In 1939, the Germans came into our town. For a few weeks, it was not bad, was\nnormal. Then, they began harassing the Jews. Taking us to all kind of a labor, hard labor, in the\narea, and things like that. And then it became every day, life became harder for the Jews. We're\nnot allowed to do, to do any business. My parents, my father could not make any business\nanymore, and I got involved to help out my family. So I used to go on my bicycle to the villages to\nbuy food, to help out the families. And then there were a lot, many atrocities that later on used to\ncommand the gendarmes, once, twice a week, and killing some people when they found bread in\nthe house, or fresh milk, or similar things like that, they shot them right on the spot. And they were\nmaking raids, capturing mostly intellectuals, at first, and taking them away to the camps. I\nremember they took away my Uncle Levin, he was a Hebrew teacher. Took him away 1940, and\nnever came back. Then they killed my uncle, they found fresh meat in the house. They killed my\ncousin, and they found fresh bread in the house. And those things were going on, you know, from\nuh, let's see 1939 to 1942. And the worst part was, the Loisia (?) was in 1942 when we heard\nrumors that the Germans were deporting Jewish communities daily to the death camps. At that\ntime in the summer of 1942, I was a young man then, and I realized I understood the fate awaiting\nme, that someday, we are next in line. So, I made up my mind that I will not go to any of those\ncamps if I cannot, uh, can escape. And in October of 1942, when we heard rumors that our ghetto\nwill be deported to another ghetto, so I managed to run away the night before. It's a protection. I\nrun away, and I run to a uh, friendly, gentle farmer, who had promised me to help me hide. I was\nuh, by this farmer two days. They treated me very nice, couldn't be any better, they treated me like\nI would be, I lost my ----------- family. On the second day, I found out that there were some Jews\nhiding in a forest nearby. So, I went to the forest, and I met some people like me, same age, older,\nyounger, and after a few days, we saw what was happening, we were on the run all, all the time,\nthey were hunting us, the German, Polish police and the Polish collaborators. So we, so there's no\nother way out, not too organized. One tried to acquire firearms and to fight back. So, after a week\nor so of being in the forest, when we heard our woman, Jewish woman, when they went to villages\nto buy food, they were intercepted from the Polish hoodlums, collaborators, some were killed.\nThey were robbed, beaten, and called all kind of dirty, antisemitic names. When we heard this we",
        "organized into a defense unit to defend ourselves against those Polish hoodlums. The only thing\nwhat we possessed at that time when we organized was the will and the courage. We had no\nfirearms. It was very hard to get firearms at that time. So we began to look for firearms. Every\nday we were prowling by foot in different villages. Many miles were spent and it was no, no\nsuccess. In meantime several weeks after, we were raided from the Germans with the help of the\nPolish collaborators, and 80% of our population was murdered. We were about 100 people there in\nthis camp in the forest living in bunkers under very primitive conditions. There were no water, no\nlights, no sanitary facilities. But, we could, uh, survive, this way, in the forest if they would let us.\nWe were raided, and after the raid, we managed to escape unharmed because when we organized\nevery 2 of us, every day, went to fetch water on the edge of the forest. There was a guardhouse,\none day, there went, two of us went to get water, and they overheard German-speaking voices.\nThey came running back, woke us up, and we quickly got dressed because we always slipping in\nthe --------, and, uh, we sent from our group a messenger to the campsite where the other people\nwere living--we were separated ourselves to live near the edge of the forest in order to be able to\nsee what's going on, if any undesirables coming into the forest. In the meantime shooting had\nerupted. They came running back with empty pails, they were hitting the pails on the trees, was\nstill dawn, dark in the outside, and they came back, I said , \"Follow me.\" I knew the area very well.\nAnd we began to run in the opposite direction. When we came to a crossing where was the road\nwas cutting through the forest, we stopped, slowed down. We came luckily behind a German\nmachine gun, 3 Germans were mounting a machine gun. We were behind them, and luckily the\nnoises from the trees and the birds disguised our footsteps, so we managed to go around them,\nquietly, in uh, on our bellies, crawled over the main road, and we escaped unharmed. In the\nevening we came back, made it quietly during the midnight, and the whole campsite was quiet\nbecause all of them were dead. We just found many bodies scattered on the ground. All bunkers\nwere blown up. We presumed that many were buried alive. The only thing what we could do then\nis to pick up those bodies, and bury them. After the burial, we said -----------. We swore that we\nwill revenge for those murderous acts. Everybody, of us, each one looked around, looked each\nother\u2019s grimly, uh, very, you know, uh grimly faces. And we understood that someday, the same\nfate awaiting us, they're going to catch up with us. We were, we were unable to get firearms. So\nwe left the campsite and began to wander around other part of the forest. After that, we next day\nwe, we uh, found some more survivors who managed to escape--two girls with a few other men.\nAnd we were counting about 20 people that time. We wandered around the forest and this took us\nanother 3 to 4 weeks. Struggling through. There was nowhere to go because (clears throat) we\nwere hunted from all the sides every day. Finally one day in December of 1942, we managed to\nacquire firearms. And after we acquired firearms, we learned first how to use them. And about 10\ndays after, we were raided again from the Germans.",
        "I want you to go back and tell me how did you get the firearms.\nOh, all right. In Dec of 1942, we were standing and warming ourselves around the circle, in in a\nfire in the forest. We were baking potatoes, and I don't know from where they get, the, uh one man\ncame, you know, the name Chaim, I knew him from before. He came, he just was among the, us\nthere. He came, says hello to me, and he start telling me, you know, he saw the situation we're in\nthe first time I met him. He was from the neighbor town Mirof. And he says to me, \"You know\nwhat? I was, uh, working as a carpenter in a village so and so, and the man's name is LeMergac,\nand he told me that he has hidden guns, that he can arm our company.\" When he told me that, a\nchill went through me overhead to the my knees. Mine ---------. I said, \"Chaim, slowly, tell me\nagain, how this, what, what about, who man ----.\" So he explained quietly, he says, \"The colony\nwas Michaloska Colona, the man has a new house built on the left side, so many houses in, and uh,\nthat's it.\" So I went over to my group, and I says, you know, I told them the story, and we all felt\nthat time, that tonight is the night we're going to get firearms. We were disappointed many times\nsimilar things, but somehow we all had a feeling. Came at nightfall, we took 2 slates, ------- slate\nbecause snow was underground, and we had to travel about 10 kilometers to the village.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nLet's back up to how, having Chaim come into the camp, and meeting him for the first, and do the\nfirearms story again.\nWhich one?\nThe firearms story, start with Chaim at camp.\nHow we got the firearms?\nWell, you have the parts, you have the part where we travelling on, not yet?\nNo, just start it again. Just start that little story again.\nOkay, good, uh huh, Oh God. All right. In Dec of 1942, we were standing in the forest, around",
        "warming up in a, around a fire. We were baking potatoes there, and all of the sudden there is a\nman, like from heaven came down, a friend of mine, which I didn't see him since 1939. He was\nfrom the neighbor, neighboring town Mirof. And he saw what's happening, that we are chase\naround like dogs, without firearms, and, and uh, he says to me, \"You know what? I was working\nby a farmer, as a carpenter. In Poland, a carpenter used to work by a farm, by a, in a place 3 or 4\nmonths, you know, making windows, doors, something like that. And he said a man bragged to\nhim that he has hidden harms, arms from the 39 war that he can arm whole company. When he\ntold me that, my, the chill, my, a chill went through my head, forehead to my toes. I said, \"Chaim,\nslowly please, tell me again, exactly what you know, what you're telling me.\" He says \"Look, the\nman's name is Le Mergac. He lives on Mikaloske Cologna,\" he described to me the house exactly\nhow it looks on each side (clears throat). After I heard this, and I felt, I had a feeling that tonight\nwe're going to get firearms. I went over to my friends, and told them the same thing, and somehow\nwe all had a feeling that tonight is the night. We had previous had many leads like that, but nothing\nmaterialized. So, came nightfall, we went and arranged us to transportation, transportation to\nsleighs with horses, and we went to this village. On the way going to the village, I was sitting with\nmy commander on the same sleigh, and talking who is going to go into this farmer, and asking for\nfirearms. And they picked me, that I should go in. And there was a name, by, a man by the name\nShapsa, he was from Warsaw. He was a husky guy with a mu, mustache, had a dark complexion,\nhe looked like a Russian. And they told me that he should go with Shapsa in. And I didn't know\nfrom here to there what I'm going to tell him, I go there. But on the way travelling, I had no choice,\nI couldn't say no, I was uh, speaking very fluent Polish, I also had a mustache, and I wore a uh,\npoliceman, Polish policeman's overcoat, and I had also a badge on my lapel, I don't know where I\ngot it from, was in a ski hat, called a ski hat. I said yes, so we went, came to the village, I found the\nhouse. I was armed with a flashlight and uh, a small caliber pistol with no bullets. The handle was\nfalling apart off, we had a rubber band to put it on it. Was an old one. I knocked on the door. A\nman opened the door with his warm underwear, it was December, was cold, and I ask him, \"Are\nyou Mr. DeMergac?\" He says, \"Yes. Please come in.\" I came in, I had my flashlight illuminated\non his face, and uh, when we came in there was one room and in the middle of the room was the\nbed, and near the bed he has his boots, he has his jacket, and to the right was a kitchen, you know,\nit's uh, has the uh, you know, built kitchen from the bricks or something like that. And he sat\ndown, and I told him, \"Mr. Lemergac, we are paratroopers from Russia. We came here to organize\nthe -------------- fighting unit against the Germans. We heard that you have firearms, and would\nlike you should give us you free, of you free will. If you don't we have to use force. I don't know\nwhere I got this uh, uh speech from, but somehow this came to my mind. He didn't say nothing.\nHe didn't say yes, he didn't say no. He just pulled up his pants, and he got dressed, put his boots on\nand his jacket, he says, \"Come on.\" So we went, walked out with him. Our men, other men were",
        "around the house. The only firearms at that time we had is make believe we organized ourselves\npitchforks. We broke off all the teeth, one tooth left on, and put a strap on the handle, and over\nshoulder--from far away it looked like a rifle. So he walked out with us to the barn. In the barn, he\nopened the door. He put his hand around a bundle of straw, was a bundle of straw standing there.\nHe picked up a rifle, gave it to me. Then he walked up the ladder, and they had a thatch, thatch\nroof, those straw roofs, walked up, put his hand in, picked up a gun, a handgun, with a bottle of\nammunition and gave it to me. And then he said, \"He has buried somewhere a gun, what was cold,\nwintertime, so I made up a ------------, then when I illuminated the, the my flashlight, he would say,\n\"Shto, shto\" that's all he could knew, talk in Russian. So I said, \"Listen, if you want to kill you, you\nhave to find this rifle. I scared him off. So he made few steps, he took an ax with a shovel, made a\nfew steps to the right, then to the left, he says, \"Here it is.\" We started digging, we found it. Then\nhe took us to the next door neighbor. His neighbor was Peter. He knocked at the door, and he said\nthe speech for me. He said, \"Peter, here are the paratroopers from Russia. They came to organize a\n----------- over here. Give him the gun.\" So he went also to the barn, picked up the same way, in\nthe, in the thatch roof, picked up a gun and gave it to us. So to make it short, in the same night, we\ngot from there, 6 firearms. Few rifles, few pistols, ammunition, everything. We went back fast to\nthe forest because we couldn't afford to stay too long, we were afraid to travel during the day. We\ncame, we test them out, we tried them out, we had some people, our men knew how to use those\nfirearms, they were serving the polish army before the war. And a week after, a week later we\nwent back again to the same village. We had already addresses to others. We came into a farmer,\na rich farmer, his name was Dunik. I already had the courage, you know, uh after succeeded once,\nyou know, and I told him the same speech. And Mr. Dunik says to me, \"You know what, if you\nreally, you are what you are, you should know me. My name is Dunik, and my brother is a\ncommunist, he is in Moscow now. And you're coming to me to get firearms? All of the sudden, I\ndon't know from where, I had an answer for him, I said, \"Look, we're not supposed to know who\nyou are, and you're not supposed to know who we are. The only thing we know that you have\nfirearms, please give those to us, and especially when you say you are communist, we are fighting\nthe same cause.\" So he bought the story, went out, and picked up a new rifle, had a uh many those\nuh storage places, was a rich man, a new ---------- with ammunition and everything else. And we\ngot those firearms through this village, all we needed, and then we got more far-, addresses,\nwhoever has guns. We went back, we were happy as could be. At that time a gun and a million\ndollars, a gun was worth more than a million dollars, because you could at least you could defend\nyourself with something. We came back, it took us about 2 weeks, we learned very quickly, how to\noperate, how to fight, you know, and everything else, and then about 10 days later, we were raided\nagain from the Germans, and there were 3 Polish collaborators spearheading the raid. They were\nwalking first with baskets, and make believe that they are looking for mushrooms or things like that",
        "in the forest, and looking for Partisans. They didn't know that we have firearms. And the Germans\nwere several hundred yards behind them. There would be contact with them, then they would go\nand surround us, or circle us around. AT that time, we had already our guard, armed, and we\ncaptured 2 out of 3, one escaped. He was running back and he was screaming \"Jews! Jews!\" In the\nback, the Germans opened fire, so we returned fire, and we captured those 2, tied them up, and we\nran out, run away, we sneaked through some ravines there, terrain, we knew the area very well.\nWe were luckily we took those 2 with us, we escaped. By the time they organized themselves, the\nGermans, they didn't know what's happening because they didn't expect that somebody going to\nshooting at them, them. And we escaped. At night we began to interrogate those guys, and we\nuncovered from them a gold mine of information. They told us everything what we wanted to\nknow, what there was the truth. Those guys were recruited by the Germans, and put 1n place before\nprior to the deportations, and they were supposed to report to the Germans who is helping a Jew\nfirst, and then who 1s selling off illegal farm products from the Ger, the, the eh, Poles, the Peasants,\nand then, who's a communist. They were involved in everything. So they went undercover, they\nwere walking around every day to the villages, and threatening people that anybody who will help\na jew will be killed on the spot with whole family. They also gave us addresses for others who\nwere working with them together.\n(Sandy says something in background, cannot hear).\nBeep\nWell, why don't you tell me how as a partisan group, people helped you and didn't help you?\nExplain to me how much...\nI would like to finish this part, now that we get into it. Okay? So after those 2 revealed to us what\nthey're involved in, and gave us the names, they were very tired at that time, but we didn't, couldn't wait,\nwe went the same night, and captured those others. In 2 places when we came in, they had passwords\nto those people, in the villages who worked with them together. And we said the passwords, they\nfainted on the spot. They saw that we know what's going on. And we captured that time as many as 8.\n6 plus those 2. And we interrogate them, and we found that they all were involved in those raids, and\ncapturing Jews, and killing Jews, and we punished them, accordingly. And from that day on, the whole,\nchanged, the whole neighborhood had changed, the whole area. We got a, we sent a message to those\nuh killers, that they cannot escape without being punished what they were doing. There was a mixed\nreaction among the people because the Poles knew exactly who those guys were. But they were\nhandicapped, they couldn't do nothing. They were afraid for German reprisals and things like that. We",
        "had no choice. We had to do what we had to do in order to stay alive. And then we learned from this\nhere, what's truly happening among the population. Before, when we, after we escaped, our escape, and\nwe were in the forest, we really couldn't understand what happening. The people were chasing us away\nlike dogs. We went to buy food in the villages, they sounded an alarm, with pots and pans, screaming\nwith axes and ------------- pitchforks, whatever they could grab at. And we were running, then uh, then\nwe understood why these things happening because those people were threatening all the time, from\nthose collaborators, and that's why they were afraid. After that, they opened up, people started to talk,\nstart to be open more, and helping us. Now who helped us was, the first who helped us were the Pep-,\nthe Polish Workers Party. After our successful mission, they got in touch with us and congratulate us,\nwhat we did, because we helped them as well. Because the same guys, the same collaborators, were\nagainst them, they were against the whole population. They were reporting to the police, to the\nGermans, everything what's there going on, what's going on in the villages. Like anybody sold some\nillegal products, farm products, or helped a Jew, whatever, and they start breathing easily. What we did,\nwhoever we caught, arrest, went in hiding, and they were underground. So we also disrupted the\nGerman spy ring. The Germans could only know where we are hiding and who's a Jew because they\nwere told from those collaborators. The Germans would never know, they could never recognize a Jew,\nexcept if he would be dressed like a Jew, or act like a Jew. Otherwise, a Pole could recognize a Jew\namong thousand gentiles. And this was the biggest uh problem. And from that day on, our lives had\nchanged, and everything had changed in the area. When the Polish eh Worker's Party got in touch with\nus, they told us that they would like to, we should join their ranks, we should work together. Uh we\ntempted for their help, for the offer, and we told them that we are, have other obligations to our own\npeople, which are in hiding. First we didn't trust them. We didn't accept to join the ranks. We told\nthem we want to work together. We sit down, we start working together with them, and they supplied\nus with all kinds of information about movements of the Germans and things like that, and they also\nassigned to us loyal members of their party, who were used for reconnaissance or for messenger service\nand so on. And from this, uh, from this day on, we uh, contact other Jewish groups which were\norganized nearby, like from Makushu, and so on, and we began to work together, and that's how things\nhad developed.\nSo, explain to me, this was all Jewish Partisans?\nAll Jewish, yeah.\nAnd explain to me what the whole group was like and how big it was.\nYou see, my ----------- group was 12. Other groups were 30, 40, and then we joined together. My first",
        "group must have been got killed around the beginning of 43. And the, all those things happened by,\nbecause, we did, had no experience, how to operate, how to behave, how to uh, secure ourselves by\ntravelling and things like that. All happened by mistakes which we learned later on. And then we\njoined with other uh, groups with a ------------- group, and there were about over 50, something like that,\nand then we joined with the Gruler's Group, which, they were POWs from Lublin who had escaped, and\nin general we later grouped together, not one group, just we worked together because it was impossible\nto make a huge group in our area to stay together. We were in contact, we performed all kinds of\nmissions together, uh, plans and things like that, and we were separate, we're not, we're not too far away\nlike 15, 20 miles away from each other. And we got stronger every day. We had, con, later on we, we\nuh, got into fight with the German gendarmes, and uh, 1943 we began already, start making sabotage\nacts. Uh, we went uh, to disarm a group of Germans in a estate. They were staying about 2 dozen\nGermans, and we went to disarm them. We did not succeed, but we went there, and we had a shootout\nwith them for several hours, and we had to pull away because we could not get reinforcements they\ncould get. And this was, I mean uh, we did not sit hiding but we look for action. And then we had a lot\nof fights with the fascist groups. After, later on, what happened when we got our firearms, established\nour bases, we found we had another enemy. This was the Polish fascist groups. They in the beginning\nwere thinking that the Germans and their collaborators will do the job, which they did mostly, they\nkilled about 90% of our population. But once we got firearms, they had a hard time to, to kill us\nanymore because, number one, we changed our way of living. We saw the for-our forest was not big\nenough to stay in the forest. We ran out of fighting places. So we moved in into the villages, and\nstayed with the farmers, and uh, they couldn't do nothing about it. First of all, we, uh, while we did that\nwe accomplished 2 things, first of all, this was a, like public relations, good public relations. We were\nlabeled from the public fascist groups that we a bunch of bandits, robbers, killers, nothing just whatever,\nis alive. So when we start to go out to the villages to stay there, we went to the, the biggest enemies\nlike, the fascist groups--came in, stayed there, ate and drank, behaved like gentlemen, and they, they\nsaw, later on they saw, they're not the same Jews or the same people they're labeling as, they're nice\nguys, and they began to understand. With the leadership worked very hard to destroy us, so they\nambushed us once or twice, we captured some of them, killed some of them, and uh, we got from them\nthe names of the leaders. We went up to the leaders. They already were, were notified that we looking\nfor them. So they understood, we told them, \"Look, we know where you live. If you want to go after\nus, you want to kill us, we kill you. As simple as that.\" And they had no choice, and stopped making\nambushes, they stopped killing Jews because they saw that we are there to take reprisal for it, and the\nwhole thing, one thing with the other, lead to the other, we gain more courage, get stronger, more\npeople came in, firearms we had no problem to get, and we organized ourselves, soph, sophisticated\nsystem where we could live. First of all, we kept tight security. Every day we were stationed in another\nplace. 20 km. this way, 20 km. south, north. Never stayed longer than one day in one place. And we",
        "came into a farmhouse, we didn't trap nobody, we didn't have to. Said, \"Good evening,\" We were as\ngentlemen, \"How can we help you?\" Of course, we said we wanted food. \"What can we prepare?\" I\nsaid \"What do you have?\" I mean we couldn't demand something they didn't have. And those farmers,\nthey had plenty of food, the potatoes, they have enough, bread, whatever they could do it, made us\ndinner, we stayed over with there, o-over day, over the day, night and day, and whoever came in there\nhad to stay with us until we left. This was our policy. And later on they got accustomed to it.\nWe have to reload.\nbeep.\nBeep.\nCan you just summarize for me the complexity of how it was, the situation without choices for the\npeasants who were threatened and who, maybe they wanted help, maybe some couldn't help.\nOkay (clears throat). After, uh, our first mission against those collaborators, things had changed.\nPeople were less afraid to talk to us. There were some who were helping us, risking their lives, keeping\nour wounded and disabled people in bunkers for the 2 years that we existed. They risked their lives for\nnot, not paid, get paid for, a penny for it. And other people who were really against us were not any\nmore open to be against us. The reason what happened before, why the situations created such was that\nthere was no laws against harassing or killing Jews. Everything was free. Those hoodlums\ncollaborators, jumped on the bandwagon, everyone wanted to be in the act. What happened, -----, they\nbecame heroes to their people against unarmed Jewish people. You understand? And they were getting\nrewards for it. There was no threat. They were getting rewards, became heroes, and that's why\neverything was, when we came into being, and they saw that somebody is there to defend Jewish life,\nbecame too expensive for them to go on and do those things. So this was there to pay a price for their\nown life. There was no questions asked. If somebody killed a Jew, he was killed. No question about it.\nAnd that's why the whole situation changed. Even those who were at heart antisemitic, which mostly\nwere, they didn't show because it's funny, let's say several weeks prior we got firearms, we used to go to\na village, we were chased like dogs. Show them money, we want to buy food, well, we came into some\nisolated places, uh, the peasants had colonies, so they sold us food, some of them didn't want to take\nmoney. There were all kind of people. No question about it. Without their help, we could not succeed,\nlet me tell you. So what happened, even we came into the biggest enemy, we knew who the enemy is\nnow. The only way why we succeeded in doing all those things, and protecting ourselves, 1s we knew\nexactly who is what. Understand? We did our homework. So we came into the biggest antisemite.",
        "Said \"Good evening.\" They took us in and gave us royalty. Everything we wanted. They asked us.\nAnd they gave us food, they gave us shelter. And later on they, what they did, they saw a way how not\nto give their quarters, or you know, the contribution to the Germans because every farmer had to give\nsome percentage of their farm products to the Germans. So we gave them receipts. That we took so\nand so, and they showed to the Germans they were killing themselves pigs, cows, and selling things on\nthe like, market. They gained on that. We really did not eat their food. We ate the food from the, what\nbelongs to the Germans. And that's how things got organized that even those fascists got used to it, they\ndidn't want to listen anymore to their leaders because their leaders had mind to kill everyone, Jew, not to\nstay alive, not to be able to testify, like I have to say testimony today. They got orders from London,\nfrom their uh, or, from their government in exile, because when we caught some of them, they told us\nthe truth, what happened. So later on they saw they can do nothing. They tried to liquidate us, but they\ncouldn't. They wanted to us, to get us in a one place, where they could, they had the means, we had\noutgunned, we were outgunned and outnumbered. Every peasant had arms, and they knew how to use\nit. And let me tell you a story once in a, in a June, May or June 1943, I went with a friend of mine, we\nwent to a uh, a estate, named Lukov, and this estate there, one of the estates, uh, what do you call, the\nbaron, they call it, we call it Fabia, he was give us, he used to give us money every month for the\nwounded, to pay, buy medicine things like that. And we came in, we announced who we are, and my\nfriend of mine who I went, he was a commander from another Jewish group, from uh, Kushov, his name\nwas Izzy, Issa Eisenberg, no, Rosenberg. And uh, there was a, uh, what do you call it, doorman, you\nknow uh, locka, we called it, he went to announce us to the uh Fabia. He asked who we are, he came in,\nhe knew him, he said, \"Hey, hello,\" and he clapped him on his hand, \"Come on in,\" he says, \"I have a\nsurprise for you.\" And we came in, and there about 24 from the AK group. 3 were officers dressed in\nuniform, Polish uniform. They were sitting at a nice dining room table, and they invited us, \"Oh, hello,\nhow are you boys? We were looking for you, we want to help you, we heard that you're good fighters,\nyou're doing a good job. So we had a few drinks with them, they tried to make contacts, make us\nbelieve that they're friend of ours, and tried to take us in one time when they could liquidate us, they\nwould do it. But the way we had a plan worked out to protect ourselves, we never went to the whole\ngroup in one place, one time. We split it up. And they knew that the group who stayed behind knows\nwhere we're going, and will take revenge. And this was all about. And they, what's the name, the uh,\nowner the Fabia gave us money in front of them, 100,000 flotas, that was, we were not afraid of that\nbecause we needed the money. And later on they tried very hard to try to get us in somehow, to make\npeace. And we knew a place was called Borof, was south of Lublin, in 1943, where were Jewish\ngroups, ---------- some group, 26 Jewish boys, were in contact with the AK, and they were naive, they\ntrusted them, so they were good, in good conditions with them. One day, they came throwing grenades\nto their bunkers and killed them all. There was even a song that time that the ar, the uh, uh el, the\nPeople's Army made a song in Polish about this story. If he really, the way we operated is luckily that",
        "we did not trust nobody--to us they were all enemies, even the French.\nWe have to reload.\nHolocaust, -----------------, 60 cycle sync, 2/10/92, CR-4 is up, Sync tape 5 is up, Lloyd Harbor,\nNY.\nBeep.\nI want you to pick it up again by starting to talk about how the way you were successful was by not\ntrusting anyone. And then I want you to tell me some of the things that your group accomplished\nin the big picture. How much of a difference did your group make?\nWhat do mean difference?\nWhat did you accomplish? ----------------\nOh okay. In Jan 1943, we ran into in a roadblock of gendarmes, a group of gendarmes in\nKusluvka, a village Kusluvka. They were searching peasants, horse and wagon, they were going\nsearching for, I don't know for what. And we had to make a turn to cross a main road, which was\nleading ------------------. And we just came behind about 2-300 yds and we could not turn around.\nWe saw the Germans, and uh, the road was situated on both sides, they had ditches. They dug, the\nditches were serving as a run of water, -----------. So we made the driver to go close to the ditches,\nwe Slided off first into the ditches, and we were waiting. And many times towards that, you know,\nthey're making raids, checking, and go away. In meantime, we're saying, saying, we said to the\ndriver, \"Turn around, slowly, we'll see what happens.\" While he was trying to turn around, the\nGermans, 2 Germans start to coming towards us and screaming, \"Come here Schwein----,\" things\nlike that. So we were laying in the ditches, and one German was, had a, had machine gun in his\nhand, high up in the air, the other had a rifle, they didn't expect that something like this will happen,\nbut they came close enough to our range, we opened fire, and we shot them both. One with the\nmachine gun, he just fell and the machine gun flew out his hand, and the other one we shot, and\nthen others from there opened fire again on us. We returned fire, and they, they shooting about 10-\n15 minutes, then they quiet down. They had a, a car, and the other 2 disappeared. We grabbed the\nmachine gun, with a rifle, and we got 2 pistols, with ammunition, and we turned around and we\nmade it fast to, to our forest, which was about 5 kilometers away, and then they came with\nreinforcements and we were gone. The next time was (clears throat) we, around May, 1943, they",
        "came into our house, staying overnight like it was normal. They came around 9 PM. We had\ndinner, we had a few drinks too. And about 8 0 clock in the morning, my cousin, Froim Levin, got\nme up. We were sleeping in the house, on straw, on the floor, and there was like here, you see, the\nwindows around, there was a driveway come in in from the main road into the around the house.\nHe say, \"Germans are here.\" I had to, only had a chance to grab my rifle, and my pistol because it\nwas everything nearby. And when I got up, and I saw the Germans walking, one window, the other\nwindow, I went behind the door, our men were going up the ladder to the attic, and a German came\nin, he was not prepared. He had his rifle upside down, I remember he had his uh finger against this\nhere strap, you know, from the rifle. He was uh, redheaded, sergeant, and he walked in, he said,\n\"Gendobra,\" in Polish. \"Good Morning.\" I was behind the door. I had the uh, gun with the uh,\nyou know with the barrel. I pulled up the 3 of them, and I shot them right in the head. He fell out.\nWhen he fell out the other guy officer had a sub machine gun. He start shooting. And one of our\nmen on top, and the other got wounded. Uh, Shlome Eisenberg. At this, that moment, we all ran\nout on a ---------- outside, and one of our men was, the name was uh, Dobresi, Micola we called\nhim, a young fella. And he came right next to the officer, and the officer grabbed him by the neck,\nstart to choke him. And my cousin came around with his rifle, point at him, he raised his hands, he\nsaid in Polish, \"Brother, don't shoot.\" So he gave him one bullet, he got him right into the clasp of\nthe belt. He collapsed like a tree. The other who I shoot, run out somehow back, back uh, back\nout, and we couldn't find him, he was somewhere in the weeds to hide himself, this commotion.\nWe took away, his, their, their what you call, the ammunition they had, they had a car O-Olympia,\nnobody of us could drive. We broke it into pieces with axes and we left. Later on, the Germans\ncame, about an hour later, this was near Scrobof. Scrobof had a uh, POW camp for Russian\nSoldiers, and one of our bullets from our rifle hit one of the ----------- accidentally, and got killed\nthere. So again we moved out fast to the forest because in the area where we were, we were about\n5-6 kilometers close to the forest. They came later on with tanks and so on, but, the neighbors were\nsaying the, that some of our men were speaking Russian. They didn't do nothing to the villages.\nYou see, what happened later on, we discouraged them of coming to the villages. In the beginning\nthere were gendarmes when, oh for food or for anything, went to make searches, and then they saw\nit's too risky. So for the people itself, we gained, made, we gained the prestige. They saw that we\nare really fighting the war for them. If they didn't come, they didn't collect their, you know, their\nquarters from them. A lot of people didn't want to give. So later on, near the end of 1943, no\nGermans there to come to the villages to collect their uh, whatever reason, they had to come with\nforce. In April, 1943, they made a huge raid in our area. Well, we were tipped off at that time\nalready. How we were tipped off? From the Poles. They saw that they have to protect us\nsomehow. They couldn't liquidate us, they had to live with us. So what happened, if they came ex,\nunexpected, into a village, we many times had a shootout with them, so some of them, people",
        "accidentally got killed, or houses were burned down. They want to avoid that, so if from Lublin or\nLubertof, big cities, Germans came to our area, we were notified. So if they came a few, we made\nan ambush on them. If we know there are more than that, we packed up and went away. We, we\nrun away to the uh forest, make ----------. We always were combat-ready. In seconds we were\nready to start a fight. And that's how, later on in uh, uh excuse me, 19, end of 1943, the Polish\nPartisans learned from us, they came in, came up in groups into the forest. In the beginning they\nwere afraid, we showed them the example. They saw the Jews can do, why can't we do it. And we\nwere uh, really connected under the umbrella of the Polish People's Army. In all the time, they\ngave us moral support, military support, everything what's needed. And later on, we got through\nthem, firearms which came from Russia, and dropped from the planes. We got submachine guns,\nmachine guns, ammunition, explosive, everything what we needed. And that's how we developed,\nwe developed a relationship with them, that they even said to the AK group, or the fascist groups,\n\"If you start doing against the Jewish groups, you, means, you're starting against us.\" They\nthreatened them. And they uh, start to behave, and that's how we managed to stay, and later on in\nthe end, let's say the beginning of 1944, things were different because there, in the area became\nmany Russian Partisan units, and the Polish Partisan units, and we were, we were just walking\naround for weeks, staying in one village. And they didn't dare to come to us. Now, the next battle\nwe had with, we had skirmishes like uh, with gendarmes many times. In uh May of uh 1944, no\nwas June 1944, 43, we went into to our town Kumunka. We staying there about an hour. There\nwere Polish police, there were the Germans, we also had an observation post on top of the school.\nNo shot was fired. One shot was fired, we returned fire in the end, and they quiet down. We\nburned down the synagogue. They made, you know, from the synagogue they made an office for\nthemselves, the Germans, and we were walking around in the town, in the middle of the town for\nalmost an hour, and there was one collaborator, we were looking all the time. He ran into us\naccidentally. He was running , he was saying, \"Jews! Jews! Jews!\" He thought that some of his\nmen are there. He fell into our hands. Then we also, we went, went to many times to the\nneighborhood uh town, town halls, which we consecrated, confiscated you know, the labor dept\nbooks, got orders to take away the labor dept books because from that they could know who was\nwhat, who was collaborating with the Germans. Then in 1943, we had\nWait. Have to reload.\nBeep.\nQuiet guys. You were starting with another thing...",
        "Yes, in the end of 1943, August, September, we were involved with blowing up trains. Warsaw,\nLublin and Lobowtov, Lukov. And in Dec of 1943, we were involved in Yami, it was a village\nwhere the Germans came, about almost 60 of them, and they were raiding, cleaning the area from\nPartisans. It so happened that we had a convention in a village named Buki. There were Russian\nPartisans, Polish Partisans, all officers there. And I happened to be there with some of my group\nand 2 peasants came in from the village, Yame, in the afternoon. At that time, we had a good time,\nwe were drinking, eating, talking strategy, and they say that the Germans moved in to treehouses,\ntook up quarters, and it's like they were instigating us to take care of them. So one many happened\nto be a Lietenant Korkel, he was Ukrainian, and he came from this village, he was born in this\nvillage. In the afternoon when it got a little dark, he took me and a friend of mine, Severumstan,\nand another man, and we went to this village to investigate reconnaissance to see where exactly\nthey are. And we came back at midnight, took about 40 men all good armed with sub machine\nguns and so on, and we went to do, disarm them, and take them away. So, it was a, the moon was\nshining, it was a beautiful night, and we were walking alongside the back of the village. When we\ncame, in the, about in the middle of the village, we heard a signal, \"Haslo,\" a uh, pass, that we\nshoot a flare. Everyone knew exactly in groups where to attack, which, which house. And uh, the\nguards, what they had, in the edge of the village, they notice something, they opened fire. When\nthey opened fire, the flare came up and took us maybe 5, 6 minutes, all the houses were\nsurrounded. Those guys from the guards, run away, left their machine guns. They all had the\nRussian machine guns with the round disks. We knew the house, we surrounded the houses, and\nwe told them to give up. Some of them who were guarding the houses, they killed right on the\nspot. It took, went, went, went so fast, was unbelievable. And they jumped out from the windows\nwith their hands up, because we told them we're going to burn them alive. And one of our men got\nkilled, a bullet in the head right when he walked into the machine gun in the window. And\naccidentally one man got killed. And we did, killed as many, maybe 20 or 30, some of them run\naway, and the officers we took with us. You know, in a place like this, when it's time to turn\naround was too late. We took the officers with us and we went, walked, went away from this\nvillage. They had maps and they showed us on the maps that they were a day before in another\nplace. So we went to the place that they were yesterday. They came into, was a forest, a couple of\nhouses near the forest, took up quarters, and around uh, nine o clock in the morning, we looked\nthrough our binoculars, and we saw that the Germans were about a few miles away surrounding the\nvillage of Yame. They came in with force, and uh, no shots were fired. They picked up all the\nbodies what we left, and those five, we had five, I think, five officers, took them out from the\nwoods, and with silencers, we killed, because we couldn't wait any longer. They gave us all the\ninformation we needed. This was a big operation there. Then the other big operation, then we had\nskirmishes, like, every week. We had contacts with Germans here and there. They were making",
        "huge raids, uh, I got to go back in uh, July, 1943, there were 2,000 men involved, Germans, -------,\ngendarmes, Polish Police, and regular army soldiers. What we were notified, like tipped off before,\nwe slipped away. We could not afford to get into battles with them like that because we didn't have\nthe equipment, and uh, then we could not get reinforcements. We, uh, our main objectives were to\nmake hit and run attacks, to mine roads, bridges, and ambush ------- many times on the road from\nWarsaw, Lublin, or other places we, we got information, this was my, our main objective. And\nthen in May of, yeah, in Ap-, in March of 1943, I was involved with a group with a Polish, with the\nRL Partisans, there was a special group formed, and we gave safe passage to the Polish\ngovernment, first Polish government who came to Lublin after the area was liberated. We had to\ntake them over to the East bank of the river, of the Buch River, and from there they took him to\nMoscow. And then later in July of 43, 1944, they came back and they became the first Polish govt.\nSo I was involved in that, and this is a long story how I was ---------. And in May of 1944, Gen.\nRolojemerski, he was the head of the Polish Partisan Support. He came to pay, pay us a visit in a\nvillage named Burki. Burki was a village near the Pasha Forest. I was at that meeting. The\nmeeting lasted 3 days, and he gave us that time instructions. That we should remain for any cost in\nthe Lublin area. He told us that the offensive crossing the Buch is coming, and we should do\neverything possible to stay in the area. At that time we were nominated some of our men to officer\nranks. There was a Hilgresban was became also lieutenant. Sam Gruber was assistant to\nGrehengresban, also lieutenant. Marian Voretsky was platoon commander and I became platoon\ncommander at that time also, the rank of a lieutenant. After he left the, the area, they start moving\nbig units of the SS, --------SS, in the area of --------. And we received orders to move out from the\narea to go South of Lublin to Yanov Forest. And my platoon was under the command of uh,\nHoolot Batallion, which was the com-under the command of Zempster, Captain Zempster, his\noriginal name was Scrinitsky. And there were a group of Russian partisans, under the name\nShapiga, and then Wandervaselevky's group, and the I, People's Army Group. We all marched up\nin March, in May, and going to uh, the area of Yanov, where we were about a thousand man force\nthat time. We had about a hundred, over ahundred horses, a horse and wagon--the horse and\nwagon were carrying the heavy equipment like sub, big machine guns, ammunition, explosives and\nso forth. And we were in two places were interrupted, uh from uh, intercepted from the Germans,\nthey tried to dislodge us and they couldn't. The last stop we had was May 11 or May 14 I think in a\nvillage named Romrof. And there, when we got into the village was around 4 AM in the morning,\nand we found no male at that time, no men, very few old men. And we got suspicious right there at\nwhat's happening, but, we had no choice, we had to go through the village to go to Yanov, but\nduring the day we didn't travel, so we took up quarters there, all the horses and the wagons we put\nnear the uh, there was a wooded area, small wooded area right near the village, and some of our,\nthe officers took quarters in the village. I had my quarter there. Around 10 AM, I got a message",
        "uh, on a horseback, by the name Lonkafefakorum. He came with a message from Captain\nZempster, and I was sleeping on the floor on straw, and I was set up, he came in, he gave me an\norder that I should take from my platoon, send a, an ambush in a close road just, described where\nthey should take him there because Germans are approaching our area. While I was sitting reading\nthis uh, message, a small plane, German plane, dived down, he saw the horse, white horse, and put\na savo, a machine gun through the roof. He came about 2, 3 feet away, in the floor, almost, almost\ngot killed, hit there. We ran out fast for the, to the outside, and he was closing around again, and\nuh, that's why they were following him all the time because it was a big group. And uh, I sent out\nthe ambush, they were a group of 6, and then around 10, 11 0 clock, we saw the Germans coming\ncloser and closer from all the sides, from Lublin from the South.\nBeep.\nAround 10:30 AM, we, there, were about 3 or 4 German planes cruising around the wooded area,\nmake observations, and we decided to pull back all the road blocks back to our positions in the\nwooded area, we took our positions dug-in, and we prepared ourselves for a battle there, we had\nnowhere to run. And they start bombarding, shooting down with the they were guns although they,\nthey always hit the trees like, and from the trees, falling trees, they bombed, light bombs, not heavy\nbombs, and machine gun fire, some of our people got wounded and killed. And this lasted about\nuntil 11:30. 11:30 from our headquarters were shooting 3 flares. One blue, one red, one white.\nAnd somehow, they got misled, they disappeared, the airplanes disappeared, and they began to\nattack us. We were in good positions. You only heard you know, music, the machine gun fire was\njust rolling continuously. And they began to attack. We were in good positions and killed many of\nthem. Over there we killed over 300 Germans. We suffered about 20, over 20 killed, and there\nwere 30 wounded. The battle lasted until about 12 PM. And then they decided to pull back. They\npulled back and quiet down, and the night we found a weak spot, and we pulled out from there.\nThe next day they came with armor, we were gone. And that time, from there, we dispersed, we\ncould not, not all of us made it to, to the Yame Forest because we always had orders, something has\nhappened, should go, wherever you can to get away from them. So, I went with my group back to\nthe area where I come from which I knew the best, and we were travelling during the day, we came\nto the crossing, the railroad crossing, Lublin/Warsaw. There was a full train of Germans with tanks\npassing by. We jumped off the wagon into the weeds, and then we made it back to our area. In our\narea, we took a rest for 2, 3 days, and then went back to our destination, Pasha Forest, and then, I\ndon't know how ------------------.\nLet me ask you something else. What happened to your ghetto? What happened to the ghetto in",
        "your town? Do you know what happened?\nThe ghetto they, the Germans came with the help of the Polish police, they chased all people out\nfrom the ghetto, who cannot run fast enough was killed on the spot, and they transported them to\nthe Lobartov. In Lobartov, they're supposed to make a huge ghetto for all the Jewish in the area,\nwhich did never materialize. They put all those people on trains, and put destination unknown, sent\nit destination unknown. That's what happened.\nSo you...\nYou want to go back to the beginning a little bit?\nYeah, what happened to your family?\nOh. My family got to, went with this uh, the deportation. So what happened, when I ran away, I\nwent to a place nearby the main road, a wooded area to find out what will happen to this\ndeportation. Around 12 Noon, was on Friday, we learned what I just said, where they, the\ndeportation went on. And matter fact, I was not alone there. There were many others, who'd run\naway and did the same thing. So we sat down in a circle, and when we heard that, what happened\nto the deportation, and start, they think what to do. I had my mind made up that I had some place\nto go, that a farmer promised me to hide. The name Klaus in a village named Koskufko. And I had\nanother man with me, he was from Warsaw, a friend of mine, a neighbor. He wanted to go with\nme. When they were sitting and talking about it, and they all decided to go back to Lobartov, well\nsome of them were the Polish ------------------Police. And they ask me, they said, \"You sitting\nhere, don't say nothing. Where you going?\" I said, \"Listen, I know one thing. If there's going to be\na ghetto in Lobartov, I always have time to go in--have a chance to run in. But to run away, I'm\nafraid it's going to be too late. So I decided I have a place where to go, and I'm going to go there\nwhere they promised to hide me.\" And they start to talk us out of it, and took only 2 minutes, and\nthey changed Yentl's mind, and I was left alone. So about 3 PM, they all got up to walk to\nLobartov. I was alone. What I'm going to do? I got up too. We start walking, and from far away,\nI saw the church, the spire of the church, and I said to myself, \"What did I promise myself? I'm not\ngoing to go freely. I said to Yentl, \"Yentl, you want to come with me?\" He says, \"No.\" So I said\nto, goodbye to all of them, I said, eh, \"Be healthy.\" \"----------------,\" in Yiddish, and I turned, turned\naround and I went back. And I went back to this farmer, he took me in very warmly, and treated\nme really couldn't be any nicer, and I was staying 2 days there, and then when I learned about the\nsome Jews hiding in a forest, I went to the forest, I couldn't be in hiding to sit alone and just, you",
        "know, and I had a good place. Somebody they told me later on, \"You were crazy. Why couldn't\nyou, didn't want to stay?\" I said, \"This is not me. I want to do something. To be first on the free\nfresh air,\" and I felt if I got, want to get killed, I wanted to ---------- first, to do something about it.\nSo I went to the forest, and I got used to it, and that's how we organized and did our own things.\nBut there were about over 20 people which went to Lobartov...because they were, the thought was\nbecause the Germans made propaganda in the beginning that they gonna be just resettled to another\nghetto, and I didn't trust them. I believed them what they were saying that they are to kill all the\nJews. And I didn't take it for granted.",
        "Did most Jews take it for granted? Can you talk about how difficult it was for most Jews to believe\nthe Germans were going to kill everyone?",
        "You see, most Jews, the majority were, let's say , people, older people, with families. Take a\nfamily man, it was not hard to decide what to do. Even he had the mind to do something, mostly\nwere religious, they believed in God. Many times we talked about it, it was very hard for me to\nsay, to argue with them. They say, \"God will help. We will overcome things.\" And I saw what's\nhappening, that maybe were hearing, not news, no newspapers, but rumors from the Poles who\nwere travelling by trains or, you know, were telling us what's happening. That they're deporting\nJewish communities, things like that. So, it's very hard to say, it was not hard, easy for them to\nleave the family or run away. With small children you could do nothing. My family were religious\npeople, mannered people. Were, the, I had brothers and sisters were small, my family consisted of\n9, my parents, were 3 brothers and 4 sisters. I'm the only one survivor. I took on my own that I am\nnot responsible for nobody, just for myself. Prior to the deportation, I never wore any those, the\narmbands. I always travelling, was travelling with a bicycle to the cities. I once went to Warsaw,\n1941, then to Lublin, I was travelling to Lobartov, almost daily, to buy food to help, you know, to\ndo something. And I risked my life because I saw one think and I knew very well that if I get\ncaught, I'm going to be killed. I accepted that. I didn't uh, I wasn't prepared to go through\nsuffering. But I had the mind all the time, if I get killed like that, I have no choice, but to go to take\nyou on a concentration camp, then, torture you, you know, abuse you, like we heard things, it didn't\nregister to me, and I took all those risks. What I did, and luckily... made it. And after I got into\nthe Partisans, I don't know from where and how, I was just new things came to my mind, I don't\nknow from where, like, uh, you put on a switch, and I knew the answer. And I was the youngest in\nmy group. But, you know, I never tried to make somebody else do for me the work. I volunteered\nwhatever I could do. I knew the area very well, which was very important at that time. And then I,\nsomehow, my, I, my whole thinking changed. I was a different person. Like overnight I became\nan orphan, and I knew that I have to protect myself. Nobody will do anything for me. And as a",
        "matter of fact, the way I became a partisan fighter in our old group, first, nobody did anything for\nus. We had to do it ourselves. That's, like I said, to get the, the uh, uh, firearms really was not\nhard. The way we got it was very easy, but you had to know how. In the beginning to buy, we\nwant to buy for money, was no way we can get it, and we were chased like animals all the time.\nAnd all of the sudden the started to call us, the same people, and we were the same Jews,\n\"Gentlemen, how can we help you?\" And the...\nOkay, we have to reload.\nBeep.\nOkay, do you want to finish that off, that you were talking about. You were talking about how at\none time the peasants chased you away like dogs, and then you came in and they said,\n\"Gentlemen...\"\nYeah. So it was like uh, we were chased around, want to buy food or get food, and later on, we\ncame in , and they saying \"Gentlemen, how can we help you?\" We didn't threaten anybody. It's\njust, the gun, was the power. We didn't point it at anybody. Was carrying, you know, normal. And\nthat's how, I, we, was very hard for us to understand what really happened because, you know uh,\nthe atmosphere, the change of heart, nothing was there, that they really liked us, and want to help\nus, but the way we organized ourselves, situated ourselves, we know what we're dealing with, and\nthat's how we have to go about it. We were nice to them, and they were nice to us. They helped us\na lot later on because without their help, we could not exist. And matter of fact, after the area was\nliberated, I was working in Lobartov, which was nearby in the same area. They used to come, and\nyou know, every week they had a market, they used to bring us presents, food, all kinds of things,\nwe'd get a, we developed with some of them, a very good relationship.",
        "Did you, in all these years, did you see the trains that were on their way to the concentration camps,\nand did you know what was happening?\nTo a certain extent. We did not know everything, no.\nWell, describe what you thought, what you...\nWe're seeing, we didn't see it, you know, uh, we only heard through rumors because we were the\nlast towns, the last ghettos to be deported in 1942. We heard from others the way they were\ndeporting them and the Poles were saying they were deporting them to the death camps. Like\nTreblinka, Midonis, Sobibor, and things like that. But, we exactly didn't know the truth, or didn't\nsee those things. I never, myself, imagined that something like this could happen. So you didn't,\nnone of you knew that it was happening. No, there were some of them who escaped from Sobibor,\nthere were 2 men escaped, who escaped came to our Partisans. One was Leo Lerner. He lives in\nJerusalem. And there's another one, I forgot his name, can't recall it, there were 2 escaped from\nSobibor, and they told us what's really happened there.\nDo you feel that the Germans that you saw operating had, were just following orders or did they act\non their own? How did you feel about that?\nIt's hard to really to say, of course, they can say they're following orders, but it depends how they\nwant to follow the orders too. They just were killing Jews in random, they were brutally murdered\nthem. Follow the orders, let's say they could arrest people, and take them away to a camp, or they\nshoot them just on the spot, so I don't think that it just was following\norders.\nDo you feel that the Jews had a lot of choices? How do you feel that people made choices in those\nyears?\nYou see, it's very hard to say about choices. If I'm going to compare to myself, there were many\nothers who had choices, they could do just the same thing as I did. I'm not talking about families.\nFamilies was very hard. Young boys, young people, if they would just take, and think about, the\nway I was thinking, I said, \"I'm going to die, anyway. So why just die like that, like a coward, or be\ndrag me, and torture me, abuse me, then put me to death.\" So I was thinking one way. I didn't\nexpect that I'm going to survive, and I didn't know what I'm getting into it. Had no specific plan.\nBut I made up my mind, when I can run away, I will run away, and look for another way, and I",
        "found the other way, when I saw the opportunity with the men there, and we organized, I was to a\ncertain extent, a big, big instigator, you know, certain things, but my mission, my way was, \"Let's\ntake revenge if we can.\" Because we had also now, met people, some of them were a little passive,\nI would say. Like, when we heard that some Jews were killed, and at that time there was no secret,\nbecause they didn't hide, the Poles didn't hide that they were killing Jews because they were proud\nof it. So, I said, there were some other young guys there, \"Let's go and do it today because\ntomorrow may be, could be too late. Others were saying, \"You know what, they didn't bother us.\nWhy should we go after them?\" I said, \"Look, we are Jews. They didn't kill the people because\nthey did something to them, they killed them because they're Jews. Tomorrow they know where\nwe are, they're going to come after us. And this paid off later on. And there was another thing, you\nsee, when we were looking for some killers, we came into a house, looking for son or father,\nwhatever, we did not touch any innocent people. If he wasn't home, we said, \"Okay, we come\nback,\" so we went. You understand? And this was a great thing people respected later on because\nthey saw we had only those who were involved of killing Jews. And they stopped to a certain\nextent. You understand? Now, for the others, I would say the same group who were with me after\nthe deportation ran away. They went to Lobartov, if they would think the same way, I wouldn't say\nall of them would survive, but some of them would survive. This way, they all went, and this was\nthe end of it. So it's very hard for me to say because everyone, the same man, which I was saying,\nYentl, he was from Warsaw, he was a refugee in our town, he ran away before, and he was living\naround the neighbors there, and he saw that I was driving around with a bicycle without a, a, you\nknow, a armband, and I knew farmers, they used to come, he approached me, he said, \"Look, what\ndo you do when the --------, if you're going to hear about the deportation?\" I said, \"Listen, the only\nthing I can tell you I'm going to do, I'm not going to go freely to a deportation, I'm going to run\naway. He said, \"I want to go with you.\" He made, he begs me. And then, he backed out. What\nhappened to him, I don't know. So it's very hard to say, see, the problem was, what I think today,\nthere was no organization. If there would be an organization to organize people, say, \"Look, you're\ngoing to be killed regardless, so why don't you take a chance?\" When I went into, when we got\nfirearms, and I became a Partisan fighter, I was not afraid for anything. It didn't come into my\nmind to hide. Bullets were flying through my head right and left. I was lucky, I wasn't hit. But,\nyou know, it never...came, came to my mind, they go, they hide, because hiding wasn't good,\nalways the safest place. Let me tell you what happened. In 1943 we were like went into a farmer\nand had dinner, so we, we developed a relationship already, so he said to me, \"You know, here,\nhere this guy is by my neighbor, hiding,\" Leibish, was. This Leibish was a man, a Jew, who was\nalmost 6 foot high, and he was serving the Polish army in the Cavalry. He had to be tall. I said,\n\"Bring him over here.\" He went to brought him over here, sit down, we ate, we had Schnapps, we\nhad vodka, were drinking, very good, no problem with food, he looked at us, and saw what's",
        "happening, and I told him what we do, and that we live like normal people, like normal soldiers, the\nway it is. I said, \"Come with us.\" He says, \"Oh no, you're going to get killed.\" I said, \"Listen, the\nsame way you're going to get killed too. There's no guarantee here.\" He didn't want to come with\nus. And a week later we heard he was burned alive. He was sleeping in a haystack, you know, the\nfarmers had haystacks on the fields, for the winter, you know, so, Germans came, somebody tipped\nthem off because he probably had money. The money ran out, so they, somebody, one of the men\nwho helped him, could, tipped off the Germans, they came, they put the things on fire, and he\nburned alive and that's it. So, it wasn't uh, not, I'm still alive. And others with me. And he was\nafraid to go with me, so, it's very hard to figure out. See, once you're in it, it's different. We\nchanged completely. Before, if let's say, if somebody would give us a lesson, of what we're getting\ninto it, maybe some of us would think, oh, how is it possible, it's really what I'm telling you here, if\nyou would be a military man, you would say, \"It's impossible,\" what I'm saying, but it was possible.\nBecause we created, we learned from experience. Common sense. Instinct. How to stay alive.\nAnd everything worked out fine, to a point. Of course, many of us got killed, no question about it.\nOh, but they got killed for a reason. They were not killed, be tortured, you know, for nothing.\nDo you have anything that you particularly want to add?\nWhat do you want me, I can add a lot of things, but you know, I suppose it depends, what do you\nwant to know more about, you know? You want to know about after the liberation or things like\nthat?\nSure.\nOr no? Huh?\nThe liberation 1s important.\nNow, we were involved in many fights with the Germans, with the Polish police, and with the\ncollaborators all the time, so, you see, uh, I mean, uh, it's very hard to describe everything 1n detail\nbecause it will take a lot, long time, you know, but in general, the population later on helped us a\nlot, no question about it, because, they, without that, we could not survive. Because they saw the\nreality. Because before, they were, you know, the propaganda was so hard, you know, the\nGermans and those right wing groups, that we are really has to be extinct because not worthy of\nliving or things like that, and they saw themselves, here we came with arms, we didn't harm\nnobody. What we ate, we drank, and we slept over, and we said goodbye in a nice way, and then",
        "some of them later on were begging, \"Why don't you come often to us?\" This is the truth. And\nwhatever we did, you see, the uh, --------- People's Army, they had to have, be responsible for us\ntoo, you understand, and they were not afraid to stand up whatever we did, you understand, there is\nnothing there that we did which was inhumane. We tried to protect us, and people in hiding, we\nhad many people who were hiding in the forest, and many who, the people, the Polish people\nhelped us to help, to keep them there with them.\nWe just ran out.\nThe end of that was ----, about the last minute of that was --------, the film ran out. All the, all the\nones that were\nbeep.\nhiding in the forest, they didn't go with us.\nAll right. We're rolling again, so why don't you talk a little bit about, if you want, either, the not\nharming anybody or the helping people hiding 1n the woods.\nOkay. Now, what I would like to add is this. In the beginning that retreated, we lay there, when\nwe got the power, and we acquired firearms, we were justified to go out and mostly kill anyone\nbecause the way they, we thought, that everybody's against us. When we caught those 2\ncollaborators, and we, they revealed to us why people were behaving the way they did, we couldn't\nsee to harm anyone. Even we went to a village where they sounded an alarm and chased us with\npicks and shovels, and we, way down, we went into the same house, armed, said, \"Good evening,\"\nand they says right away, \"How can we help you?\" We had dinner and then we asked him, \"Why\ndid you do those things before?\" He says, \"You must understand. Our lives were threatened\nbecause those guys were running around every day and threatening us if we gonna help Jews, we're\ngoing to be killed or from the Germans or from them. Now, the way we helped the uh, our people,\nsome of them were in the forest, were healthy, and we helped them with food and so on, they\nhelped themselves too, and our protection, the other groups didn't bother them, for one thing. And\nthen we had those, we had wounded, and we had those who were disabled, woman or some\nchildren, so we found placed in the villages, people who willingly made bunkers, in their barns, and\nkept them all the time. We'd just provide them with food. So the food, sometimes, we brought is\nmostly from the estates, we had big estates in our area. So we went there, and took whatever we\nneeded, and some of them, we gave it to some uh, peasants who could not affort, and then we used",
        "to pass by and use the food and so on. And so in general, we created the atmosphere that was\nsuitable for partisan operations. People understood more what's going on. And they saw\nthemselves because every day for 2 years almost, we had to live in some of the places, we used a\nlot of places up, so this alone gave people an education. Because many were saying that our party\nhas teaching us to uh, do everything possible to reveal you and things like that. They didn't listen\nbecause they felt that their lives are in danger, or the neighbors or some of their families, and they\ntry, tried hard to avoid to report to the Germans. So, that's how we managed to, to operate in a nice\nway and uh really it was like a cat and mouse for the Germans. Many times somebody revealed,\nthey came, we were gone. And many times they were disappointed. They felt that they didn't get\nthe right information because overnight we made sure when we went into a place, nobody is\nfollowing us, nobody sees us. And the next day, we're gone. If somebody, let's say from the family\nmember, said to somebody, and the somebody was reporting to police, they came, we are gone.\nSo, they couldn't do nothing to the people because they claimed we came with in force. We came\nwith guns, they had no choice. They could not say no. Even we didn't threaten them, but they were\nsaying, what they had to say, that we came with force, and what can they do?\nCan you talk to me a little bit about what you think happened to most of the Jewish men who were,\nand women who were, say from 35 and older.\nYou see, what happened to them, I cannot say, those would say who went to the concentration\ncamps or so far, those who were in the area, first of all, in our area, in Brachnik Forest, when I,\nwhen we first organized, the most of them got killed in the first raid. And uh, in the other forest, in\nthe Parshif area, there were many who survived. Together when the Ger, Russian army joined up\nwith our troops on July 23, 1944, and they were also liberated in the forest.\nSome other partisans that I've talked to who were Jews who were in route of non Jews were\nthreatened by the non Jews and had to conceal their Jewish identity.\nOkay, yeah, let's we talk about it. You see, there were many partisans, Jewish partisans, in Poland\nand elsewhere. There were many Polish partisans and Russian Partisans, and they were groups like\nwe were. Independent Jewish groups. The Polish, the Jewish who would find themselves Polish\nPartisans, they were many times abused or so on, they didn't feel comfortable. The ones who were\nin the AK, in the Fascist groups, they weren't a few, who didn't look like Jews, they were hiding\ntheir identity. The others in the Russian partisans, they were not discriminated. We, as an\nindependent Jewish Partisan fighting unit, and, under the umbrella of the Polish partisans, we didn't\nfeel any discrimination against us. They were treating us very well, all the time, they, we were",
        "treated with respect and honor and so on. There was one antisemite, you know, was Ukrainian, he\nshowed his uh, the way he was uh feeling bad, but, it didn't mean anything to them, they were just\nbeing...So in general speaking, I mean uh, that's the way the set-up was. We did not want to be\ntogether, infiltrated with them together because we had our obligations, and we felt what we're\ngoing to do, we're going to get credit for, and otherwise we would be sweeping floors or shining\nshoes with them. We showed them that we could fight as good or sometimes as better than they\nare. And the reason was that we had nowhere to go. Our direction was to fight. Or to kill or be\nkilled. They had homes intact, they had families, they had somewhere to go back to. We did not\nhave that. So our, we could not even surrender. You see, the beginning what we thought why they\ntrusting us, they were trusting us, the people's army, people, you know, the Polocks, Polish\nPartisans, better than their own because they knew that we cannot surrender, because surrender\nmeant dead by torture. We had nowhere to go, just that one direction, fight. Fight. Everybody\nwho was in our path, our enemy, we didn't care, we had to defend ourselves. And that's the way we\nremained, they let us because not in all the areas, some areas SE of the uh Buch River, they didn't\nlet uh, Jewish, uh Partisans to be independent. They tried right away to disperse them, you know\naround among them. So we tried hard and we showed them that we can do our job. When they\ngave us missions, we fulfilled, and we remained like this. And they later on, you know, through the\nranks, they tried to uh, reward us for it because they saw during the times what we did, and\neverything else. We got, you know, nominated some of us to officer ranks, and we were uh, happy\naltogether now. After the liberation, all of us, the Jewish Partisans, the Polish Partisans were\nintegrated into Polish govt. Everyone received a job according to his ability, so we were treated\nvery fairly, I couldn't say that we had any discrimination whatsoever.\nOkay, thank you. That's all my questions. So we have to just sit here for 30 seconds.\n30 seconds of room tone from previous interview.\nEnd of room tone. End of Sound Roll.",
