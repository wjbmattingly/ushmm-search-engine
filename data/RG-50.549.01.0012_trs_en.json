Many times we slept on the bare ground and when we woke up in the\nevening you know we were covered with snow. And it was very tough. It was not an easy life at\nall. Later on when in January, end of December and January when it became very cold, we took\nover how do you say, a hunting lodge which was deep in the mountains. And we did make a\ntunnel from there because it was close to a stream.\nFrom the stream we made a tunnel to get into the hunting lodge. So that nobody could\nsee whether there was any movement, the movement went through the tunnel and we stayed in\nthis, in this hunting lodge. And our activities were we were, you have to remember that this part\nof, where we were and also Auschwitz itself was incorporated into Germany. It was German\nterritory. They claimed it as German. And many of the inhabitants, Polish inhabitants were\nevicted. And many of the farms and so on and big estates where the Polish owners were evicted\nand Germans were brought in from deferment parts of Romania and Latvia, Lithuania because\nthe Germans were straight and even Russia there were German people living in Russia, in the\nVolga region.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

But\nwe did also undertake some where we intercepted some prisoners and we, I know of, of only one\ninstance where we intercepted two Polish prisoners while they were taken from one place or\nfrom one camp taking to the main camp. They were intercepted by us and taken. And they were\nfreed.\nWell how it was done that they were convoyed by guards, by two guards, two prisoners\nand from the sub camp to the main camp on the way they were approached. We had uniforms.\nWe also had SS uniforms and we approached them and we told them. that we were\nrepresentatives of the camp Gestapo, or the political department and that these two prisoners are\nneeded for interrogation. And we signed the papers an gave to the guards and they released them\nand we took them over. And they came and joined the partisans.\nIt so happened that they didn\u2019t, one of them anyway didn\u2019t survive. He was later on killed\nin an action. Where matter of fact I had another friend of mine came the night before to this safe\nhouse. And we left next night and in the morning this house was surrounded and one of the, the\none prisoner who was released by us was the, there were actually four of them and they were all\nkilled with the exception of one. Who hid in the basement of the, of the house and while the\nGermans tried to flush them out they were throwing grenades into the basement, he always\npicked up the grenade before it exploded and _ threw it in the next part of the basement.\nAnd then he buried himself in one corner of the, of the basement there was you know\npotatoes, when they grow and I don\u2019t\u2019 know to do, how do you describe them. Potato and they\nhave light you know they start growing. And people in order to prevent it you know they take it,\ntake these parts off. They grow and he buried himself in there.

They bound his hands behind him. With a\nbelt. And put him on a truck and were driving him to the camp. Somehow when he was sitting\nthere in the truck he loosened his hands and jumped out of the truck you know and while he\njumped out on the road, he hit his and broke his collar bone and smashed his face. But picked\nhimself up and he run on the road. Before they stopped the truck, he got away. And he survived.\nMatter of fact he lived in Canada in Edmonton. And last year he died.

We didn\u2019t want that. But what we did since some of the big farms were\ntaken over by the Germans who were brought out from different parts of Europe, we did tell\nthem that they will have to move out. We were harassing them. And we were also blowing up\nyou know bridges and railway jun, there was railway junctions.

We also took cattle from\nthe German farms and so on because we needed to feed ourselves. But the life in the partisans\nwas very, very hard. Very, very tough indeed. And many times we also went hungry. If we had\nto if we couldn\u2019t get any food from the Germans, you know of course we did buy food from the\nPolish peasants but we paid for it cause we had funds for this. And we didn\u2019t want to anybody to\nsuffer.\nNow there were, we did have well I can tell you one instance where we did matter of fact,\nI and three other. I was in charge of this action. We went, we were always very close to the\nAuschwitz concentration camp. Quite close. We you know we and one day actually one night\nwe went and we, we had to do something and then on the way back we were rather tired. It was\nlate at night and I said let\u2019s knock on the windows of a hut and let\u2019s hope that these are Polish\npeasants. As it happened, he was a Polish peasant and did knock on the windows and he came\nand we told him who we are and whether he could give us a lift. Through the mountains. It was\nquite a distance to walk. And he said oh yes. He will and he right away he got dressed and he\nwent to the stables and he you know harnessed a horse and to the sled and we got into the sled.\nAnd we told him to avoid the main roads, to go you know through the villages and so on but\navoid the, the main roads because on the main roads there were German transports going and so\non.\nWe didn\u2019t want to have any encounter with them. So as we came to one village and it\nwas of course snow covered, the terrain and it was rather dark night. But still the reflection from\nthe snow you know it was making it. Anyway we came to the middle of the village. As we were\nin the middle of the village, we looked to the sides and there were tanks parked in the, in the\nyards of the, of the peasant huts.

As we came to the\nmain road a truck, a German truck came out and the road was very narrow and the truck stopped\nand a sergeant, SS sergeant got out and apparently he had the intention of arresting us and that\nwe are trying to interfere with his war. And but when he saw us four there in the sled, it was the\ndriver, there were five, he didn\u2019t\u2019 utter a word. He, he realized that we were probably he realized\nthat we were partisans.\nBecause on the main roads the Germans had big boards, billboards. The written and\nwarning that the German troops of bandits, they called us bandits. Bandits you know so I\u2019m\nsure he realized that we were one but he didn\u2019t say. Anyway had he uttered something you know\nwe would have to shoot him because, but so we went, we came to the main road. The main road\nwas at that time free and then we went a little bit further to the foothills and we dismissed the,\nthe driver. And we thanked him very much and we then walked there and we went back into the\nmountains.

You know there were\nexceptions. Many, some of the Poles you know collaborated, but there were very few. Nobody in\nPoland collaborated who was on the top you know. I mean of any stature. Like in different\ncountries. Like for instance in, in Norway, Quisling you know who collaborated openly you\nknow with the Germans.\nIn Poland we didn\u2019t. We were, and we were all united.

But, but, but you know the Poles were not to the extent.\nThey always say there were Polish pogroms. There were no Polish pogroms because the\npogroms which were existed you know were during the Russian occupation of Poland. And a\npogrom has to be sanctioned by the government. And in Poland during the, the existence you\nknow after the First World War, the, between the two world wars you know which Poland was in\nexistence for 20 years.

And as a clerk I had to keep the evidence of the prisoners you know. How many\nprisoners there were and who went to another block and so on and so on.\nWell one and there were reports you know the roll calls were twice. And well at first\nthere were 3 times a day and then afterwards they were twice a day. And at one evening roll call,\nI got a from the main office you know that one prisoner had the next morning had to be delivered\nyou know to the main office. And apparently I was not supposed to tell in this until after the roll\ncall. But I told him before the roll call. Now what this fellow apparently knew or suspected what\nis going to happen, that he probably will be executed so I and I told him this before the roll call\nso when I told him, he disappeared.\nBut we were already in the compound and he couldn\u2019t escape. It was impossible to\nescape from there but, but what happened he, he hid himself in one of the blocks. One of the\nblocks that was being built and he between the scaffolding you know he hid himself. Of course\nin this delayed the, the roll call because they had to find him. And they found him very soon\nafterwards.\nSo afterwards you know the, the block head he fired me right away. He said you know\nyou shouldn\u2019t have told him this and he fired and I was punished to be sent to very heavy work\nand, and the SS told him that I, that he should watch me that the heaviest possible work would be\nassigned to me. So when we came back after the roll call one of the fellows said why don\u2019t you\nhit him. You know because he caused you so much grief. I said why should I hit him. I just\ncouldn\u2019t, I why should I do this.

That I am, how I felt and I never did anybody any\nharm.\nBut there were people you know there were people. There were prisoners themselves you\nknow who behaved very, very, very badly. And they were punished later on. And, and look it,\nnot only was limited you know to the German prisoners because there were German criminal\nprisoners. There were also Polish prisoners you know who were very, very cruel to other people.\nAnd there were Jewish prisoners who were cruel. They there were Jews who were also you know\nblock elders you know and who behaved.\nOne has to understand that some people thought that if they are going to be cruel or be\nvery tough on other prisoners that they will save their own skin. You know the, the, the instinct\nof survival was very, very strong in everybody and some people thought through cruelty to\nothers you know they will save their skin and others as I think in my case you know I just tried to\nbe inconspicuous you know and, and just behave. You know as a human being.\nI also you know there, there were prisoners who for instance were stealing from other\nprisoners you know bread you know which was punishable. If you were caught stealing another\nprisoner\u2019s bread which was you know our, our you know food was very meager, it meant that\nthis guy, the other prisoner from whom you stole the bread, he probably is going to die. So it was\npunishable by death and it was punishable by death, by the prisoners themselves you know it\nwas, they took him to work. Some of the capos or something. He was told that this fellow stole\nthe bread and they, they killed him. So there were many terrible things you know which I many\ntimes I don\u2019t want to recall them.

We also took cattle from\nthe German farms and so on because we needed to feed ourselves. But the life in the partisans\nwas very, very hard. Very, very tough indeed. And many times we also went hungry. If we had\nto if we couldn\u2019t get any food from the Germans, you know of course we did buy food from the\nPolish peasants but we paid for it cause we had funds for this. And we didn\u2019t want to anybody to\nsuffer.\nNow there were, we did have well I can tell you one instance where we did matter of fact,\nI and three other. I was in charge of this action. We went, we were always very close to the\nAuschwitz concentration camp. Quite close. We you know we and one day actually one night\nwe went and we, we had to do something and then on the way back we were rather tired. It was\nlate at night and I said let\u2019s knock on the windows of a hut and let\u2019s hope that these are Polish\npeasants. As it happened, he was a Polish peasant and did knock on the windows and he came\nand we told him who we are and whether he could give us a lift. Through the mountains. It was\nquite a distance to walk. And he said oh yes. He will and he right away he got dressed and he\nwent to the stables and he you know harnessed a horse and to the sled and we got into the sled.\nAnd we told him to avoid the main roads, to go you know through the villages and so on but\navoid the, the main roads because on the main roads there were German transports going and so\non.\nWe didn\u2019t want to have any encounter with them. So as we came to one village and it\nwas of course snow covered, the terrain and it was rather dark night. But still the reflection from\nthe snow you know it was making it. Anyway we came to the middle of the village. As we were\nin the middle of the village, we looked to the sides and there were tanks parked in the, in the\nyards of the, of the peasant huts.

As we came to the\nmain road a truck, a German truck came out and the road was very narrow and the truck stopped\nand a sergeant, SS sergeant got out and apparently he had the intention of arresting us and that\nwe are trying to interfere with his war. And but when he saw us four there in the sled, it was the\ndriver, there were five, he didn\u2019t\u2019 utter a word. He, he realized that we were probably he realized\nthat we were partisans.\nBecause on the main roads the Germans had big boards, billboards.

Anyway had he uttered something you know\nwe would have to shoot him because, but so we went, we came to the main road. The main road\nwas at that time free and then we went a little bit further to the foothills and we dismissed the,\nthe driver.

So you\nknow it mutually understandable that they knew that there were partisans and knew that they\nwere, but we didn\u2019t interfere with their actions and they didn\u2019t interfere with us.\nAnd in, in January of 45 when, when | don\u2019t\u2019 Know the exact date but probably in\nthe middle, in the middle of January because Auschwitz was liberated a, | think at the\nend of January on the | think 28\" of January. But it was evacuated on the 18\" January.\nThe able bodied prisoners in Auschwitz were evacuated to deep into the German Reich\nand they were marched. So in the, in the middle of January when we knew that the\nfront and the Russians are coming close, we an order came from the main headquarters\nof the partisan unit.

And since we knew about it,\nwe said we are not going to the headquarters knew about it, they disbanded. They gave us orders\nto be that we will be disbanding and go as civilians and they issued us false papers as civilians.\nIn the neighborhood.\nSo we went after the Russians moved there we went as civilians and we went back to\nAuschwitz. In Auschwitz I had other friends of mine who came escaped from Auschwitz. We\nregistered ourselves in Auschwitz as former prisoners of Auschwitz. And we got legitimate\npapers from there.

And we encountered many,\nmany Russians and especially the Russians who near, when we stayed near Auschwitz they were\nalways asking us how far 1s it to the former Polish German border.

For\ninstance I after I stayed in Krakow for some time I think in end of February, I think we, my\nfriend who also lived in, in northern part of Poland, not far from home town, we wanted to go\nand we went. And for instance we had to travel mostly on top of the roof of the, of the trains.\nThen we only could get, we couldn\u2019t go through Warsaw. We had to take some line. Then and\nwe had to walk, to walk many times you know for, for many hundred, not hundred but tens of\nkilometers.

And we\ncouldn\u2019t also we had to walk for an hour I think, some 30 or 40 kilometers to the next, and I was\nhobbling on this foot and eventually there was a cart, a peasant\u2019s cart and I, they put me on the\npeasant\u2019s cart and that, til we came to his home town which was 1s approximately 40 miles away\nfrom my home town.
