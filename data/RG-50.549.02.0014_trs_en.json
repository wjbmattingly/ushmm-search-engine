        "Q: When did you enter Sobibor?\nCE: Oh, we went -- we came to Sobibor in 1942 -- in -- in November of 1942.",
        "Q: Okay.\nSE: I was born in Holland and I was the only girl for four children and the youngest and\nwhen I came in Poland, I met Chaim, we had to dance front the Germans, because it was\nkind of a sadism that the fire 1s burning and all the dead people got bur -- were burning\nthere and it was a -- smelled from smoke and -- and that\u2019s -- there was a sadism was some\nthat we had to dance under these circumstances. Was some Jewish people what had an --\nan instrument and they were playing the music and that\u2019s the way we met. Chaim asked\nme to dance. And that\u2019s the way we met.",
        "Q: And what language did you speak?\nSE: Love. What did we speak for language? He spoke Yiddish and little bit German and I\npou -- spoke Ger -- a little bit German, so that really was the language that we spoke. We\ndidn\u2019t have much time to speak, really, together. Of course --\nCE: Go ahead. I came from Poland and I spoke Polish and German and we met, as my\nwife just said, we met with the -- the Germans looked for things to -- sadistic things for\nus -- th-they -- w-while the fire, as she said, the fire was burning from the people who\nhad just came on transport and they made us dance and they took the people with their\ninstruments, they played and we had to dance and I ask her. And that is where we met.",
        "Q: Do you remember, in the language of love, what you first talked about?\nCE: I don\u2019t remember. It probably was about anything.",
        "Q: I see.\nCE: Anything about the camp, things like that.",
        "Q: And did -- 1t seemed in the transcripts that you knew and in general, Polish Jews knew\na lot more than Selma, or than Dutch Jews about what was happening at first. Is that --\nCE: Well, well, we -- before even I came to Sobibor and we saw people go -- my father, a\nmatter of fact, came six months before me to Sobibor and he went to a camp, so the\nrumors were that people go to the -- to the gas chamber. But this was so\nincomprehensible that nobody won\u2019t believe it. But [indecipherable] when we came to\nthe camp -- a matter of fact I came with my brother and they pick me out to work and\nwhen he went to the gas chamber. So then we knew what\u2019s going on. So that was not any\nmore a rumors, there was facts, what happened. Separate --\nSE: [indecipherable] sort clothes, that you found the clothes for your -- for your brother\nand that\u2019s the reason -- the moment that you saw the pictures from your brother and\nthings like that.",

        "Q: Came together?\nCE: Yeah.",
        "Q: And were you immediately separated?\nCE: Yeah. When we came out of the train, they separate, but I didn\u2019t know what picking\nout means. They picked out from transport, from about 1000 people, about 20. And I\nhappened to be with 20 from the 20 people. So by -- we didn\u2019t know what it means,\npicking out, but it meant to be working in camp.",
        "Q: Instead of?\nCE: Going to the gas chamber.",
        "Q: I know you\u2019ve had a long time to thing about this, but do you -- do you have any idea\nwhy they picked you?\nCE: No, he asked me -- what did he ask me, something -- where I come from and I told\nhim from where and he says, \u201cCome out.\u201d And that\u2019s it. No reason at all.",
        "Q: Okay.\nCE: Just luck.",
        "Q: And, for you?\nSE: I came with a -- a whole bunch of girls what we met in -- 1n jail in Amsterdam. I was\nin -- in -- in Amsterdam in jail because -- in jail because I was hidden and that was a\npunishment. And so we met a whole bunch of Dutch young girls. The youngest was 16\nand I was the oldest, I was 20. So and -- and then we stayed together, we went to a\nconcentration camp in Holland first and then we went to Westerbork, where all the Jews\nwent through, then we went -- sent to Poland and we went in a freight train, it was the\nfirst freight train what went away from Westerbork. And there wen-went three days and\nthree nights in the train and when we came on, all the Germans were standing there and\nbecause we were all young girls, they took us on the side, where all -- the first transport\nwhere they took Dutch girls out. And they say, \u201cYou stuus, go stay on the side.\u201d And that\nwas It.",
        "Q: The side of the train?\nSE: No, we were already past the train. They were already off from the railroad station.\nWe passed already that we were standing there and then could we see that the women and\nthe children went straight to the gas chamber and the men had to sit on the side and they\nhad to take their shoes off and they have to bundle the shoes together because everything\nwas sent to Germany, so the shoes had to be together and not when they\u2019re loosed and get\nit lost. So -- and that we show, also that some German gave them a card and they had to\nwrite home that they came now in Sobibor and -- and that they are safe here. And then we\nwas --were -- that we walked to camp one. Sobibor was divided in three camps. Camp",
        "Q: And?\nSE: And he went to the gas chamber. But I hear -- it was after the war that I saw all the\npapers and the names.",
        "Q: So you did not even know they were there?\nSE: I didn\u2019t know even they were there. Not in the moment.",
        "Q: So your main pals were these girls?\nSE: The girls.",
        "Q: And, do you think that -- I asked Chaim what made you -- why did they choose you to\nstay. Do you think that they choo -- chose you because you were young, pretty and --\nSE: We were young and we were with whole bunch of Dutch girls -- 19, I think. And\nthey all took us because we were young girls that could work there. And that was -- that\nwas the only reason.",
        "Q: So the women and children, they tended to?",
        "Q: But you did not know this at first -- when you were first --\nSE: Oh, I had no idea. You know, my mother was called and my brothers were c --\npicked up and I started go to my mother. Only thing what I want and I could have gone ar\n-- out of the concentration camp, I could -- in Holland, I could got away and in the police\nstation where I was in -- in Utract, I could have got away. But I want to go to my mother.\nI was -- I thought, is a big camp and I will find her -- and my brothers. So, my mother\nwent to Auschwitz and my brothers, too. I didn\u2019t know that, I heard it was later on when\nthe inf -- when they took all the information for the Holocaust museum.",
        "Q: How long had it been since you had seen your mother when you arrived in Sobibor?\nSE: I was hidden in 1942, in half year? Something like that, a half year.",
        "Q: And you had never been separated from her?\nSE: No, no. I was the youngest on the children, I was always together with my -- my\nmother.",
        "Q: And so, you might have been feeling a certain way, that you would see your mother in\nSobibor?\nSE: Yeah. No. Perhaps, I didn\u2019t even think. You va -- you have no time to think when\nyou came in Sobibor -- starting screaming and hitting with the whip and -- and you have",
        "Q: Hitting you with a whip?\nSE: Not me, no. But it was one woman -- they scream and say \u201cOut, out, out .\u201d And -- I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly, we fell over each other. I mean, there was one woman which\nthrowed away her -- her backpack and also her baby fell and does _ she say, \u201cOh, my\nbaby.\u201d And then the German hit him with a whip in the face, the blood was streaming. He\nsaid, \u201cI will take care of your baby.\u201d So -- and there was -- there was a n -- an -- babagun,\nit was a tremendous noise and it was a trolley which comes out and there were the old\npeople were put in and children what were loose, they put in the trolley and that went\nstraight to the gas chamber. So it was just -- you had no time to think.",
        "Q: Do yo -- did anyone there, in authority, speak Dutch?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, there were some Dutch men were there, but I know even from my\nhometown, I saw them the first day when I came to camp one, where the brought us to\ncamp one, I saw the Dutch men, and they di -- aniss -- and I know them very well, they\ncame from my hometown. And I say, \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d And they didn\u2019t say anything,\nwhich is so strange because one was -- his parents were my best -- parents best friends.\nAnd later I spoke to them and they told me what is going on. And they were all killed -- a\nfew weeks later, all the Dutch men, 72 Dutch men were shot to death because they say\nthey want to run away and it was not -- I don\u2019t believe it was true, because there was no\nplace where they could run to. But perhaps was yet true, who knows?",

And a lot of people got shot,\nbut anyway, regardless, whoever worked at the clothes, couldn\u2019t stand the temptation not\nto take it and they stole the food.

        "Q: Yeah, I think so.\nCE: All right. The uprising was before -- before the -- the see -- about a month before the\nuprising, they came -- Russian Jewish prisoners of war, to Sobibor, from Minsk. And\nthey picked out about 30 - 40 of these people to work in camp. And among them was one\nRussian captain, who had -- a Russian captain -- Paturski, we -- Sacha we call him. And,\nas I say, he was a captain in the army. Now, we had plans and we talked about an\nuprising and there were different plans, some realistic and some not, but there was -- the\nma-main thing what was lacking is the courage and a good planning. When he came there\n-- when they came there, w-we start to talk with him, they want to run away the first day.\nSo we told him it\u2019s not so easy to run away and also told him that we have our map! --\nour own plans and let\u2019s talk it over, maybe we can do it. Anyway, it ended up, we\u2019re\ntalking so much, we made it up to make a plan how to escape. And the plan was that we\nworked usually til five o\u2019clock, so decided at four o\u2019clock, th -- our uprising will -- will\nhave started. And the way it would be is, in each group, we work with group -- we had\nalways about two, three of Germans what supervisor of the watch does. And it was\ndecided -- people were assigned to go and kill and this -- each group, two -- two people\nwere assigned to kill the German and just hide him with a magazine, whatever and then\ngo through like nothing happened. And all the -- the wires were cut -- electric -- t-\ntelephone wires were cut and that one -- that\u2019s the way for about an hour -- in this hour\nhad to happen, everything. And it was progressing very good. And the barracks where we\nlived here, there were working places --",
        "Q: You\u2019re pointing to --\nCE: Here, here --\nSE: No, that\u2019s where the German lives.\nCE: Yeah, yeah, no.

They usually work --\nSE: No, looks here, here --\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: -- here [indecipherable] that\u2019s where the German live.\nCE: They usually --\nSE: Here\u2019s the tailors and the -- and the goldsmith.

        "Q: So the shops were in between?\nSE: In here, in here, in -- in here.\nCE: In the same barrack of the same section.\nSE: Here we have ever slept. With no bivon.\nCE: [indecipherable]. So, they usually work for the Germans, they fit on shoes, coat,\nthings like that. So they called in these people to come to measure out shoes fitting or\nthings like that. Why that happened was they killed their olversum, so there was killed\nabout -- I don\u2019t know, about 10 - 12 jammers, about three - four --\nSE: We don\u2019t know exactly.\nCE: Roughly about. And some were cleaning card. And when it was five o\u2019clock we\nwent back from the working place to the place where we always went back, where we\nslept, to the -- the main gate. W-We came back and there was already tension a lot,\nbecause people start to see what\u2019s going on, there was nervous and confusion.\nSE: They start already shooting all over, from ou -- every side. Did you tell the -- oh.\nCE: That\u2019s all right.\nSE: When we -- Chaim say to me, \u201cYou have to be in four o\u2019clock by,\u201d -- there was a --\nand one building there were older -- m-medicine and all the little things was 1n that\nbuilding.

[indecipherable] camp -- camp two, somewhere.\nSE: Yeah, somewhere in camp two here, there\u2019s a buil-building. And I was there and I\nwalked out, he said, \u201cPut a lot of clothes on.\u201d So I put all my sweaters and another vest\non and I walked to him and I -- and when we were standing there, one of the men were --\nwent around and told how many are all killed, say to one of the guys, which is staring at\nus outside, you have to go and kill this German, that was Newman.\nCE: Newman.\nSE: What was the -- no.\nCE: Baker, I think.\nSE: Baker? Oh yeah, Baker. And he -- this man was in an office, on the way -- this office\n-- let me say here, when we walked here, we had to walk past this office and he was\nthere, so said Chaim, \u201cYou have to go. Because w -- are already so many killed, SS\u2019s\nkilled, when you don\u2019t go, we\u2019re dead anyway.\u201d So, he didn\u2019t want to go, so Chaim went\ninstead of him. So Chaim stayed and I went inside and took a knife --",
        "Q: You -- you went in the office, also?\nCE: No.\nSE: No, I went in that -- in that building where all that food were -- a -- our things were\nand I\u2019d give him a knife and at once he was gone. And I was so upset, 1t was Chaim, it\nwas Chaim. So I li -- I went looking through this office and I hear screaming like -- oh,\nthere was a pig k-killing, so much noise. And he help, with another capo, a Jewish capo,\nhelped to kill this Baker.",
        "Q: And were -- this was not part of the plan?\nSE: No.\nCE: Not at all, there was -- because I -- as I say, I didn\u2019t had any assignment.",
        "Q: You what?\nCE: I didn\u2019t have any assignment that I have to kill somebody, but the situation was so\nlast minute, you do what you can to save the situation. Because w-we would have been\nkilled anyway, without the uprising, especially with an uprising, so it was just a question\nof -- of [indecipherable]. So, I figured, if the fellow want to go in, so I have to go and we\nwent together -- a matter of fact, the knife I slipped -- the knife I shoved -- knife I cut\nmyself and I came out, I was bleeding and Selma gave it -- she had a handkerchief, she\nbandaged me and it was full of blood. And we went to the front gate, aft --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stay with the -- the killing a little bit, just because it\u2019s such a -- I know -- a\nterrible experience to -- first of all, you were not chosen to do that, but who was it that\ntold you to?\nCE: There is another fellow, as we said, he was assigned to go to do that. But he got\nafraid the last minute, so we didn\u2019t have anybody to go and it has to be, as she said, he\nwas in a place where we had to pass there and if we wouldn\u2019t have been, we would have\nbeen all in danger, so --\nSE: And if one person couldn\u2019t go -- that it was too much a job for one person, so one --\nch -- p -- Pazifski --\nCE: Pazifsk1.\nSE: Pazifski.

        "Q: A capo?\nSE: A capo what went there, he killed three other ones and then he went there and he got\nkilled later himself, he didn\u2019t came out. And -- and so Chaim went there and Chaim,\nwhen you killed that man --\nCE: Yeah, I said, it -- it\u2019s job with the knife, I said, \u201cThis for my father, for my brother,\nfor all the Jews which you killed,\u201d that\u2019s when I jabbed him with the knife.",

        "Q: He did with somebody else.\nCE: The other one -- was another fellow too, he stabbed him too with the knife.",
        "Q: The capo?\nCE: The capo yeah, both -- we both did it.\nSE: And you know, also, the reason that we know for sure there would something\nhappened, th -- lately the camp got very big, we had to build up lots of barracks and --\nand it got -- they build it up that 100 -- 100 people could sleep there. So we se -- we\nknow for sure there\u2019s something going on. And it -- and there came no transports, there\nwere no transports any more. And the Germans -- they were already pulling back. So we\nthought they\u2019re building perhaps for the Germans in camp. And so we were -- we know\nthat -- and it was something that was not s-safe and we know thewas was going on. So\nthat\u2019s the reason also that -- that they pushed it more and many Russian militaire came to\ncamp and he wants to run away the first day what he saw what is going on and that\nhelped all -- of course, too. When it was o -- the reason was also that they made the camp\nvery big and a lot of Jewish people came also there, from Minsk and so, we thought, why\nare they building so much? It so does -- and it wa -- there came no transports, so the\ncamp was really not necessary for the Jews any more. So that\u2019s the reason also that we --\nthat they thought it 1s very important that there 1s an uprising.",
        "Q: And y-you seemed to know right away that they were talking about it, but then when\nit became to a plan, they did not share it with you, or -- how did you find out?\nCE: No, as I say, I have the friends, what they were involved in and I knew always what\nwas going on.

But, as I say, I didn\u2019t want directly involved in\nit, because -- that was becau-because my friends were in it, but the - -the head of the\nuprising, he made restrictions, how many people, because it was -- kept it so secretly, if it\ncomes out, it\u2019s the end of it, so.",
        "Q: Must be hard to keep a secret in a camp.\nCE: That\u2019s right. People get desperate and people talk too much about and there comes\nout too -- too quick.",

Okay, the -- the other part I would talk about now, how -- how you got out at\nthe gate and where you were in relation to everyone else who was running and the mines\nand --\nCE: Well, when we came back from work, when we c --\nSE: [indecipherable]\nCE: When we came back from work, we -- as I say, we walked normally like always,\nafter working in a -- all odly way -- we went back and we came to the main gate, where\nwe lived, through -- through here -- through here, over to here is the gate over here.\nAnyway, we came back there and there was, as I say, a big confusion, everyone 1s\nstanding. A lot of people ran on to mines and got killed there. A lot of people ran to the\nfront gate and dustare got killed there, too. Somehow we ran to the front gate and we\nwere lucky, we came out of the --\nSE: They started shooting already.\nCE: And there was --\nSE: Franzel started shooting already.\nCE: [indecipherable] started shooting way ahead time, because there were some rifles,\nsome of the people from the camp, they were -- already had some rifles.

And also the people on the towers,\nthey starting shooting too.\nCE: Yeah. So anyway, we went to the front gate and we got out of the front gate.\nSE: Over you hear, on the -- on the -- on both sides you hear the mines falling -- and that\npeople falling on the mines. So you hear that on both sides.\nCE: We ran as fast --\nSE: We heard screaming.\nCE: Yeah, we ran as fast as we can -- we had --\nSE: And shooting in back of us.\nCE: We had still a quarter of mile we had to clear, to the woods, because from the\nentrance to the camp, til there was still about a quarter of a mile and it was raining, I\nthink, or something. It was raining.\nSE: [inaudible]\nCE: And we came in the woods and so we start to ran as far as we can, but it seems we\ndidn\u2019t go too far. Was the whole night running, we were about four miles away from --\nfrom camp.",
        "Q: And were you with a group at first?\nSE: No.\nCE: No, we were always [inaudible]\nSE: Just were the two of us. We were just with the two of us. We run and run and run, we\nwere just with the two of us. And --\nCE: Again we -- the thing that -- we were in the woods for an hour, maybe something, we\nfound another group -- a group of our other inmates which ran away and they had some\nrifles and --\nSE: But we just told this story.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: That we -- just told you the story that they want to shoot Chaim and then I jumped in\nfront of him and then they didn\u2019t shoot him. I jumped --",
        "Q: Why would they want to shoot him?\nSE: Because they didn\u2019t want me. They were afraid for some Dutch woman what -- what\n-- what will they do with somebody who -- what doesn\u2019t speak Polish and not Yiddish?\nSo they want to get rid of me, that\u2019s what we think, we don\u2019t know. Anyway, we went\nfarther just with the two of us.\nCE: That they didn\u2019t want us.\nSE: Yeah\nCE: That they didn\u2019t want us. So we just --",
        "Q: It was too many more, or?\nCE: Yeah. Well, I don\u2019t know the reasons. Anyway, they didn\u2019t want us, so we decided\nto go on our own. I was thinking, because I -- as I said, I worked as a farmer before I\ncame to Sobibor, I thought maybe I go in this direction. So --\nSE: We walked with the stars.\nCE: We walked --\nSE: Out the stars, was a lot of stars and when it was night we walked and in daytime we\nwere hiding in the woods or in an -- ha-haystock or -- sometime -- once we went stayed\nwith another farmer what Chaim give him money, again. So we -- we slept outside and\nwe eat the things what we saw on the -- on the field. Til we came one day -- and we don\u2019t\nknow really the time, it was 10 days or something like that, til we came by a farmer.\nChaim ask him if auseda -- 1f we could stay there.\nCE: We had -- when -- before we ran away from the camp, we were thinking about\nsometimes they ran away. So we were hiding valuables, what we found in the luggage,\nlike gold, diamonds, money, things like that. We were hiding it over at this fireman\u2019s\nplace. The fireman -- because there was everything fire burning, so we brought some\nvaluables sometimes and he was hiding in the ground. When we ran away, then we can\ntake it with us. Now, before we ran away, the day we sort of go to ran away, we took all\nthese things what we put away and put it with bandages on our legs, so we had money\nand valuable things we had with us.",
        "Q: By we, who do you mean?\nCE: We. I -- [ran away. When we -- the people ran away, probably all of us did the same\nthing.",
        "Q: No, I mean your valuables. You said we, were there more than you and the fireman\nthat hid your valuables there?\nCE: I -- I say we, but I mean ma --\nSE: He always says we.\nCE: I mean I --\nSE: You.\nCE: -- was hiding --\nSE: You took that. You did\nCE: Yeah, and I took it with -- with me, the money, because I thought that we would go\nto ran away. And so, that is if we had money after we\u2019re out, so we had money and\nvaluables with us. So when we ran away and we came to people, we wanted to be hidden.\nSo we offered them, we said, \u201cWhatever we have,\u201d and we showed them what we have,\nif they go to keep us, say, \u201cCan I have everything?\u201d Til one day, we came to a farmer, he\nwas very nice to us and he says -- we ask him the question of he wants to keep us or the\nmoney. He said, \u201cI cannot do it, but I have a brother what lives about 10 kilometers noss -\n- away from me and he lives on little more isolated place, he probably willing to do it.\u201d\nAnd he took us, he put hay on a wagon -- this atop was an old lady and me he put on olm\nwagon, excuse me and -- and covered me with branches and he drove us to his brother.\nNow, that was very dangerous, because if the -- on the road was caught us, we all would\nhave been dead on the spot. Also his family, which was very --\nSE: Caring.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nChaim and Selma Engel. This 1s cassette number two, side one. Okay.\nCE: So, this -- he took us to his brother and we talk with the brother and the brother\nagreed to keep us.\nSE: No. No, we -- we had to wash ourselve and he saw that the money what we had all\non you. And then he ste -- started t-to keep us.\nCE: She knows the detail better.\nSE: Yeah, I can remember that very well.\nCE: All right. He -- he agreed to keep us and -- and we were there with him for about --\nSE: Nine months.\nCE: Yeah, for --\nSE: And we -- and was ve -- I -- I saw th -- and now we think it 1s -- was an hero -- herok\n- heroie -- how you call that?\nCE: Heroic.\nSE: Heroic thing, what he did, but we had a very difficult time. We lived together with a\ncow, on top of the cows, we were hundred of fleas on us, we had lice, we had a scabie\nand we were undernourished and we didn\u2019t get much to eat and there was a pail in the\nfront of us and that was our bathroom. And we -- we slept under a roof there were holes\nin and -- it -- and rats and -- and -- and -- and we were -- we never could wash ourself and\nwe never -- they was afraid to get -- to come downtown -- downstairs, so nine months\nlong we didn\u2019t wash ourself and -- it -- 1t was a ver-very difficult time. Very, very\ndifficult time. But still it was tremendous what he did, because he could shoot a -- shoot\nus too, like Chaim\u2019s friend, what was on the fireman, he went to a farmer and the farmer\nsay, \u201cYeah, I will take care of you, you can stay here.\u201d And in the middle in the night he\nwent to him and killed him with a hayfork and took all the money what he had.",
        "Q: Now, I wanted to ask you how you found out about that story?\nSE: What story?",
        "Q: How did you find out that the fireman was killed?\nSE: Oh, that we heard after the war, from somebody -- from a gavy --",
        "Q: After the war?\nSE: Yeah, after the war we heard.",

In a house we stay -- after the w -- 1944, when -- after\nnine month that we were with the farmer, then we went to Helm, that was 15 miles from\nthat, we were hidden and there ca -- we came together in that house that belonged to a\nJewish people and it was a hundred people were there, but all for the partisan and\neverybody and everybody tells the story. And then they tell the story, people what know\nabout y-yashi and he told us about that.",

Do you --\nCE: We were at the farmer and -- matter of fact, a day before the Russian came, is -- is\nthe children -- not the children --\nSE: No, d-day before the Russian came, there was some birds and they flying up where\nwe were hidden. And there was all children playing and they went -- run after these birds\nand at once they saw us. When they came on top of us and we were hidden there. So they\nwent downstairs, but it was already the whol -- there were a lot of people already there,\nbecause they ran away from the Germans, like Polnisha people and so that was our\nsafety, because the next day the German came and --\nCE: The Russian came.\nSE: The Russian came and freed us. So, thank God that was -- just happen. So thank God\nit was -- just happen. Ma -- the ti-time that we were hidden, once also that we moved,\nwhen we were laying on straw on the -- on the roo -- a-above the cows.

So at that time,\nwhen he slept, I was not allowed to sleep and we were very careful that nobody could\nhear, so we had to lay very, very quiet and always when we were sleeping and we\ncouldn\u2019t talk, only whisper. And we couldn\u2019t walk. So, 1-1t -- it was very, very difficult,\nvery difficult, nine months long. After the war, when I started walking, I was so weak\nthat I couldn\u2019t not -- almost not walk.

        "Q: And you moved to another place?\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Now we went to Helm. In Helm there were all the Jews what -- I thought we were\nthe only Jews what were alive, because I thought every camp is like Sobibor. And it was\noh, a hundred people came there, to that house and we slept in a single bed, we didn\u2019t\nhadn\u2019t have nothing. We had no money, we had no clothes and we were very weak and\nwe came there and Chaim started working and they had the -- Chaim had to go in the\narmy, the Russian -- in Polish army. So Chaim started working in the hospital as a nurse,\nhe doesn\u2019t know se -- he doesn\u2019t even know how -- how blood looks. And I started\nsewing for people. No, I started first cooking in the kitchen and then I burned my foot.\nAnd then I started sewing for people to make some money and we made some money,\njust to live on. And then we had -- 1t was somebody what the -- all the Jews went back to\nSobibor because the -- gesundheit -- and all the Jews went back to Sobibor, a lot of\npeople went back to Sobibor, because the only sabotage which you could do in camp was\nha -- taking the money what came in, fr-from the people that went into the gas chamber\nand they hide it in the ground. So they went back to Sobibor to find that money. Well,\nthere was a lot of money hidden all over.",
        "Q: It was abandoned? It was abandoned?\nSE: Yeah, yeah.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: So, they were killing each other. So he didn\u2019t go. I said, Chaim, we made it so far, we\nwill -- we\u2019ll make it without the money.",
        "Q: You mean Jewish people? All the Jewish people?\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Ye -- All -- all Jews and not Jews, everybody, everybody. So one wom -- man had\ndol -- gold dollars and it was the number was gone.

We don\u2019t know who. So the man didn\u2019t believe us, of course and so\nwe -- Chaim made some money, he gave it to him. Now 10 years later, we live in Israel\nand is in a whole group of people from Sobibor coming together. And I say to the man,\n\u201cDo you remember, the hundred dollar for you, it was under my pillow, that -- that w-we\n-- somebody stole it under?\u201d And the next day he was there, he says you owe me hundred\ndollar -- dollar.",
        "Q: He said, you owe him?\nSE: Hundred dollars for the hundred dollars was stolen and --\nCE: So anyway, that\u2019s beside the story too far away. So --\nSE: No, that is co-connected with the whole thing that it -- ot later, you [indecipherable]\nany more.\nCE: Yeah, then we had somebody, you know, a Frenchman, what is his name?\nSE: No and then we -- we -- we were in Helm and -- and we couldn\u2019t stay there, because\nwe lived in a very small area, with hundred people and -- and -- a --",

        "Q: Jewish?\nSE: Most, yeah, all Jewish -- all Jewish. And so, we couldn\u2019t stay there longer, because\nwe slept together in one small bed and it was not to eat and there was nothing for us to do\nand he had to go in the army as soldier and --\nCE: [inaudible]\nSE: So -- so -- where am I? Then we start -- we went away -- were freight trains and we\ntrekked from one town to the other an-and in every town we found was some Jews what\nlived there, where we could sleep overnight. So, one day, we f -- met a man, it was a fr --\nsomebody from France and he was also a survivor from Sobibor and he told us, \u201cYou\nknow, I -- I was -- I live in a town,\u201d -- Chaim had to go in the army, in the Polish army.\nAnd said he, \u201cI live in a town,\u201d Partsiff was the name of the town, \u201cand there\u2019s a Jewish\nwoman and she owns a lot of houses. And when you change your name and grow a\nmustache and say I think a few years younger or f -- older, older. Then you don\u2019t have to\ngo in the army.\u201d And so that\u2019s what he did.

        "Q: Can you spell that?\nSE: You have to ask Chaim. Krishev. And -- It\u2019s a Polish name. And so we went to that\ntown and there we came and the woman gives us an -- an -- an -- aroom. One room and -\n- and -- and two rooms. And it was very, very neglected, it was -- windows was -- you\ncould put your fingers in between and we didn\u2019t have anything, absolutely nothing, no\nbed -- no -- no chair, nothing. So Chaim started taking from other houses, wood what was\nt-turned down and he builded a bed for both of us and the baby was slee -- and then later,\nyeah -- and then later we were so -- was sawing wood, Chaim got pain in his back and the\nsame night, I got pain in my stomach, so -- I didn\u2019t know of a -- Chaim had pain, yeah, so\nanyway, I had to go to the doctor -- to the office.",

I wa -- somebody else should have told me don\u2019t do that right away, but I\ndid it.

So then we stayed and then we opened that -- and then we went out of the\nhotel and we build our own house. We had it built an house. Because we -- in Holland,\nwas nothing there and th-th-the Dutch people suffered also, tremendous, it was very big\nsuffering not only for Jews, but all for not Jews. The Jews were especially -- and also\nthere were more Jews killed percentage-wise in Holland -- from the 125,000 Jews what\nlived in Holland, came only after the war, 15,000 dollar -- to 15,000 people back. So\nthere -- as a percentage-wise 1s a very big, big amount of people are killed in Holland. So\n-- and so when -- when I give up my citizenship -- was very hard of course.

So we started the textile business and we did very well,\nwe builded a house and we lived a little bit above our I-level.

He swindled us for everything. And in Holland, it\u2019s very hard to start\nanything. For everything what you do, you have to have a license. When you will start a\ntextile store or you want to start a vegetable store or you want to start anything, you have\nthe license. Only not with the ice cream. So Chaim could buy a business in ice cream and\nin something else.\nCE: [inaudible]\nSE: In Breedan, another town. So he -- I had two little babies, so I didn\u2019t want to go with\nhim and he went by himself and he came weekends home. And it didn\u2019t do well, so we\nlost also that money that we had -- we lost also in that business. So I -- I see -- I was\nalways a Zionist. I always wanted to go to Israel.

He wanted to go on a boat to America, he wanted to go just -- there was one\nthing he wants -- to go to America. So this uncle and aunt -- the doctor -- went to visit to\nAmerica and -- and went to Buffalo.

So -- but the life what in Israel, I didn\u2019t like that life,\nI didn\u2019t like -- I saw many things what I didn\u2019t like about.\nSE: He spoke Hebrew, I didn\u2019t speak Hebrew.

Because he could find something to do what\nhe could do and was happy. So that way -- that was also the reason that ve -- va -- and\ndone what a -- what we have in Holland. No, I -- that\u2019s the best thing we ever did, that we\nwent away from Holland. I\u2019m thank God -- I\u2019m very happy that we went away from\nHolland. That\u2019s the best thing we ever did.",

        "Q: Go -- we\u2019re preparing then to go to -- to America. For you this 1s very important, so\nwhat kind of preparations did you need to make other than the affidavits?\nSE: Nothing.\nCE: Nothing really, nothing, just --\nSE: There was a couple, what lived in the same village, they went a year before us, so we\ndidn\u2019t have anybody to go to and we thought we go first to my brother. My brother was 1-\nin between, immigrated to Canada. He lived in Toronto.",

        "Q: He was also unhappy in Holland?\nSE: Yeah, yeah, could say that -- that, I think -- he was not very right for th -- for that\nbusiness, because my sister-in-law has two left hands and was not a good housewife, so\nthe hotel was very neglected. And a hotel has to be clean and nice and -- and it was not\nand I think that\u2019s one of the reason also, that they moved to Canada. And they were\nplanning first to go to Israel and that\u2019s the reason also we went to Israel b -- fore. But\nthey went to Canada. And so when we went to America, we thought we can go to\nCanada. But when you go -- where you emigrate.\nCE: When you emigrate, you have to come first to the country where you emigrate to and\nso we didn\u2019t have any address here. Yeah, you can\u2019t -- when you -- but first you have to\ncome to the place where you emigrate to. In other words, you have to come direct to the\nUnited States and after so many weeks, you can go out of the country. So because we\nplanned to go first to Canada, we couldn\u2019t do that, so we had to find somebody that we\ncan come to United States, because didn\u2019t have anybody here. So, in the place in Israel\nwhere we lived, was a couple what we knew, they moved to Westport, and --",
        "Q: Connecticut?\nCE: Yeah. And that was our only address we were in contact with, so we written them,\ntell them the story. They said, \u201cNo problem, come to us.\u201d So we came to Westport and --",

        "Q: And did you have English language -- speaking?\nCE: My English --\nSE: Yeah, he spoke a little bit.\nCE: I spoke very little. My job at Cristida\u2019s was -- Cristida\u2019s has orders. If you want to\norder groceries, you call it in and you take orders. And my job was to take these orders.\nNot alone my English was bad, but I didn\u2019t know the items even, what they\u2019re talking\nabout. Anyway, I struggled through about nine months and then I already planned to do\nsomething else, because that 1s not what I wanted to do. So, they had Arnold\u2019s bread, you\nknow Arnold\u2019s bread? Arnold\u2019s bread has the routes. You buy a route, like a franchise.\nYou buy a route, you have it -- your own truck and you deliver to different stores and --\nand | -- if somebody what came to -- from Arnold\u2019s to this -- to Cristida\u2019s, he wants to\nsell his route.

So, sure I had to pay him time because I didn\u2019t have all cash,\neverything, but we had some money and we gave him some and through the years we\npaid him off that. And we did pretty well. I mean, I had to go out every morning, three -\nfour o\u2019clock in the morning and five days a day and this -- that\u2019s what it was. But I\nalready was thinking we could do it --\nSE: He hated it, again.\nCE: I was thinking already, what do I next -- what I buy next. So, because I didn\u2019t know\nthe country and didn\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on. So I look for something what it\nlooks a little simple. And I thought -- I saw a different card shop, I thought might be --\nthat might be something that I wouldn\u2019t have trouble with my language and things like\nthat -- wouldn\u2019t be so difficult. And I -- my route was in Stamford, Stamford and area.",

And after that, we never got any money. We had\nto sign that we will never ask for money again and Chaim doesn\u2019t get any money from\nGermany.",
        "Q: From the German government.\nSE: No, no.",
        "Q: And -- and many survivors do?\nSE: All the survivors do. All the survivors get a lot of money. And that kills me. Not him,\nbut me.",
        "Q: I wanted just to -- when did you begin to speak publicly?\nCE: Oh, I don\u2019t know how many years ago.\nSE: Not so many years ago. 20 years ago.\nCE: I don\u2019t know -- well.\nSE: 15 years ago.\nCE: W-We -- we -- we find that it\u2019s very important that we go to sp-speak to the children.\nIt is very important, first of all, that we tell the story and number two, although they learn\nin the school about the Holocaust, and they see maybe pictures, they let them read some\nbooks, but it\u2019s different when you see a live person, from his own experience, tells the\nstory. And I think it makes some impression on them, because usually, after we spoke in\na school, I assume it is an assignment from the teacher that tells them to write about the --\nthe impression that we were there. And the letters are very, very, very interesting.\n[indecipherable] Now, a matter of fact, one -- one -- usually the children write the letters.\nOne -- one these letters weret -- one\u2019s from a mother has written us a letter and she says\nin the letter, this says, \u201cWhen my son comes home from school, I ask him, \u201cHow was\nschool today?\u201d He said, \u201cAh,\u201d just [indecipherable] and said, \u201cAh.\u201d This time, after we\nspoke there, he came back, he didn\u2019t wait even for the question, he said, \u201cOh, you know,\ntoday we had some people from the concentration camp and it made so much big\nimpression on me.\u201d\u201d\u2019 She was so ex-ex-ex-excited about it, tells us the story. So I think,\nsome expresses more than the other, but I think 50 - 70 percent, 1t makes an impression.\nThey will remember always, they will tell always, if somebody denies the story, they will\nalways know to remember, when I was young, there was somebody what was there, he\ntold us our story. So we find it very rewarding for that reason alone. Is it one percent of\ntwo percent, that it leaves some impression on them. So I think that\u2019s the reason we go\nreally talking on school.",
        "Q: And you also are very involved, I remember, even in our trying to arrange when to get\ntogether, with giving food for the hungry. Could you talk about that?\nCE: Well, that is more hers a sa -- sa -- up -- subject.\nSE: Now, I started it. I didn\u2019t have anything to do and I was on -- very depressed, so I\nthought -- I worked in the hospital, but 1s very hard working in the hospital, because it 1s\nso far away from here and 1s no traffic. So, I started working in the soup kitchen,\ncooking. But -- 1t is very primitive and very boring and you cannot cook really. So I\nlooked for something else. So there\u2019s an organization, a Rachel Table, in New Haven and\nthey picking up -- this 1s Ju -- an Jewish organization really, and they picking up from\ndifferent places, volunteers, food and bring it to soup kitchens. So, I started doing it,\nwhich was very heavy work, because there\u2019s sometime very heavy trays of big -- so\nChaim -- we do it now together. We picking up food from different places, from restaura\n-- from bakeries mostly and from stores and we bringing it to the soup kitchens. And we\nha -- we have one soup kitchen in Branford and wh -- we have a lot of voluntun bring it\nwi -- to a man\u2019s shelter in New Haven. That do we three times a week. We do it Monday,\nWednesdays and Friday.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you connect -- I know you don\u2019t every day, but I mean, is there a time\nwhen you connect the fact that you were getting food for people to a time when you did\nnot have it?\nCE: I don\u2019t think so.\nSE: No, no.\nCE: No, I don\u2019t think so. We just do it, no matter what, just we feel we have the time and\nwe need volunteers for that. So we took [indecipherable]\nSE: We are Indian givers, we are like a -- when I have clothes, I give -- I see poor people\nthere, I ask them, \u201cWhat things can I give? I have a very good coat, I don\u2019t want to wear\nit any more.\u201d And then I did -- I don\u2019t give it -- I give it to the head from the soup kitchen\nand she gives it. So -- things like that I do and -- and clothes, we give and -- we easy --\nwe like to give what we can. We\u2019re not rich. We\u2019re not rich people. We\u2019re -- I-I\u2019m\nalways scared to death, God forbid one of us has to go 1n an nursing home. Chaim was\nalready very sick, he had already once a stroke, was paralyzed, has very high blood\npressure. He\u2019s not a very -- thank God he\u2019s now in very good condition. But -- so that\u2019s a\nvery scary time, here, now -- to get old, very scary.",
        "Q: In America?\nSE: Yeah. I\u2019m very afraid. I\u2019m very afraid, every day. God forbid something happened.\nWhat will we do?",
        "Q: You mean financially?\nSE: Financially, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. I see. It-It\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not fair.\nSE: No, it\u2019s very scary, very scary, yeah.",
        "Q: I wanted to know, you know, about the children also and I -- I\u2019ve heard so many -- of\nsO many situations in which, as a Holocaust survivor, it\u2019s very difficult to approach the\nsubject with your children, or you don\u2019t want them to know, or why should they know\nand you --\nCE: They know, but they know -- but we -- some --\nSE: Our daughter is very open, and she goes with a Jewish man.\nCE: Some -- some survivors live with it for every day, we never did it. We put it aside.\nAnd our children know about exactly what happened, but we don\u2019t talk often about.\nSE: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re right. Freddie didn\u2019t know, but after that the film came out,\n\u201cEscape from Sobibor,\u201d and the book, now he could put the things together how it was.\nWe never talked with him. Our daughter is now a little bit easier. When she has a Jewish\nboyfriend, which is very active in the Jewish organizations. But w-we -- we don\u2019t -- we\ndon\u2019t -- we have a daughter-in-law what doesn\u2019t want to hear about it at all. I don\u2019t think\nshe ever -- she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s so hero -- heroic -- that what we do -- our lives and\nthings like that.",
        "Q: She\u2019s not Jewish?\nSE: She\u2019s not Jewish, no, and [inaudible]\nCE: Prosperous [inaudible]",
        "Q: Prosperous?\nCE: [inaudible]\nSE: When she hears it later, I don\u2019t know.\nCE: She\u2019s the nicest person when you go there, no joke.\nSE: No, that\u2019s true.\nCE: Really true.\nSE: Yeah.\nCE: If you go there --\nSE: She makes the Seder this year -- yeah, she\u2019s wonderful. But there-there\u2019s no closely-\nness and 1s perhaps our fault, who knows? We ca -- what do we do [inaudible]\nCE: It is not our fault.\nSE: That\u2019s what you say.\nCE: I think we are --\nSE: I don\u2019t know\nCE: -- we are very nice to them.\nSE: Anyway.",
        "Q: I -- I just finally want to ask, I think you\u2019ve answered it, but there may be -- what is\nthe most important message, you feel, to get across when you share your life as a\nHolocaust survivor?\nCE: Well, I would say it is good that -- or I don\u2019t know how much people will believe in\nthe stories, because there\u2019s always -- people never experien -- always when I go to the\nchildren, I tell them about -- about the experience we went through, I said, \u201cNo matter\nhow good we tell it and no matter what pictures you see and no matter what you read,\nnever -- nobody can imagine what 1s has to be in a situation like that. You have really to\nexperience by yourself to know what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d So, I think when we tell a\nstory, for us it 1s so deep, it is our life, but for those the story is, it just maybe 10 percent\ngetus of the feeling what we have. So, that\u2019s the best we can do. We tell them the story, if\nthey want to believe -- some will, some not. People would have more compassion and\npeople would understand more what life is if they says by themself had a hard time to\nlive, they understand what can be. But otherwise, some people just doesn\u2019t beat up,\ndoesn\u2019t t -- go through. So, we do our best, but how much it 1s and if realfrence, I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: And you -- though, if they were going to apply it to their lives, what if they said\nsomething like, \u201cBut nothing like that will ever happen here,\u201d what would you warn them\nto -- you said in the other interview to stay alert. What did you mean by that?\nCE: Well, no-nothing begins big. Even Hitler didn\u2019t begin big, it was very small. You see\nhere, 1-1f you see something comes up -- what you think the Ku Klux Klan, you had the\nWhite Supremacists -- is that the right word? White Supremacists. And all these things,\nyou think that 1s small, but they can -- not always, but it can grow to be something big, so\nyou have to be alert. If you see something like that, think that could grow. Not always\ndoes it, but you have to be alert. That\u2019s what I meant by the \u2018be alert.\u2019 So, you be aware\nof it, what\u2019s going on.\nSE: On the moment is here, in Guilford, is a movie on television, I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat it was, but I was yesterday to a Haddassah meeting and they said it was very anti-\nSemitic. They say something about the Jews and that it was not written, that what the\nstation say, we don\u2019t have the same opinion and the-they sa-say they going to call today,\nthe -- today\u2019s Monday?\nCE: [inaudible]\nSE: Yeah.",

        "Q: Oh.\nSE: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s danger, it could still happen.\nSE: Yeah. Still can happen, it can -- still happens. Sp-Specially when here -- here -- when\nwe moved here, 20 - 40 - 30 years ago, there were no Jews here, in this town. We were at\n-- we were one of the first -- were a -- there were a -- a dentist and a few, but they didn\u2019t -\n- they didn\u2019t know what Jews were here. Now, there live more Jewish people, not many,\nbut more Jewish people here and there\u2019s a synagogue and so -- no -- and there\u2019Il be more.\nBut here in -- if here was in --country club not far from here, was no Jews allowed 10\nyears ago or 15 years ago.",
        "Q: Can you apply that to what happens in America now with immigrants who come or 1s\nthere any similarity or --\nSE: No.\nCE: No, I don\u2019t think so. We -- we have too many --\nSE: W-W-We didn\u2019t know too much about it.\nCE: Yeah, I s -- as I think, I believe at least, because we have so many minorities in\nAmerica, so is less chance that something like that could happen again. Because you have\n-- first of all, it\u2019s all these people come from different countries, either it\u2019s Irish or it\u2019s\nEnglish or Italian or whatever. So people have some roots somewhere else, so they don\u2019t\nfeel -- like Germany, there was German and German born from -- from [indecipherable]",
        "Q: There still is.\nCE: And still is. But th-the same feeling, it\u2019s not here in the United States, they still are --\nare counted from immigrants. These -- two, three generation back, they all came from\nsomewhere. So, my feeling is that things that -- that shouldn\u2019t happen, logically shouldn\u2019t\nhappen here. But I could be wrong.\nSE: Well, before the v -- in 1910 - 1915, there were no Jews allowed to be -- work in\nbanks here in America and the Jews had a very, very hard time when you speak to people\nwhat lived here before the second World War.",
        "Q: And wasn\u2019t it hard to convince the United States government to come and help the\nHolocaust victims?\nSE: Was a boat with the Holocau-ca-ca-caust victims was here -- what the boat was here\non the harbor and they send them all back and they all got killed in -- in -- in Auschwitz.\nCE: Yeah.",
        "Q: What year was that?\nSE: Nineteen-four -- in the war -- 1942, or the 43 - 42 - 41. In the war. So --",
        "Q: So is there anything else, even through the Sobibor or the journeys that you two have\ntaken together, is there -- 1s there anything else you want to add?\nSE: That we live -- hope to live long -- another few years together. No, I did -- I don\u2019t\nthink about.",
        "Q: About your relationship, it seems to be the thread which has kept you who you are, the\nentire time, from the moment that horrible music and forced dance happened -- that it --\nCE: I -- I don\u2019t think so. I think we tried to be straight people, honest people and we live\nour life and we try to help poob -- some people. But that\u2019s about everything. I wouldn\u2019t\nknow what to say more. In re-regards that people learn something from the experience.\nNo, we do our part, we tell our story, and you know, how much people will accept it.\nAnd if it gets bad time, you never know. People becomes -- becomes bad. They became\nbad, so --",
        "Q: I -- I got such a feeling of reading about Sobibor and reading your two transcripts and\nhow it was difficult to know who to trust. I felt -- I wonder, is it difficult in life to -- to\ntrust after going through an experience where it wasn\u2019t just Jews or it wasn\u2019t just the\nGermans, it was also your own who were difficult to trust at times? Has that occurred to\nyou, or --\nCE: Well, 1-1-it\u2019s individually, how the person is --\nSE: You got it -- you\u2019re not very open person.\nCE: Well, well, what do you mean not open?\nSE: You don\u2019t tell your inner thoughts ve -- not very easy and -- and --\nCE: Well, that\u2019s my nature, but it\u2019s nothing to do with that. Maybe is that I don\u2019t know --\nSE: Actually that has to do with it.\nCE: Maybe. Some people a -- don\u2019t talk so much about certain things and I\u2019m probably\none of them. So --",

And Selma, you have anything -- anything else?\nSE: No, I don\u2019t have anything else to say, that I hope just we get a nice understanding\nwith our children and -- and that we have a few --\nCE: [indecipherable]\nSE: -- happy na -- happy and healthy years na -- ahead of us.\nCE: Times like that, they\u2019Il never happen again, that\u2019s what we hope.\nSE: Yeah, that\u2019s what we hope, that times like that never will happen again. And we\nsuffer still under it and that\u2019s -- that that never will go away.\nCE: No.\nSE: No.\nCE: We miss it mostly with holidays when you come to get back together with family,\nwhat we don\u2019t.\nSE: We have no family.\nCE: And that is -- that 1s a big thing what we miss.\nSE: The children, yeah.\nCE: The chil -- miss.\nSE: Yes and it\u2019s very sad and -- and nobody understands that.

They cannot understand it, was\nthey never -- I mean they have families together, they will not -- comes not in the head of\nto ask us over, almost never. We don\u2019t want to go really, because we feel even more\nlonely when we go to another family and they have so much family and we sit there just\nthe two of us. So we not go. But that doesn\u2019t say, would be nice when they invite us. We\nhave some friends what invite us.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Yeah, we have some friends what invite us. We couldn\u2019t complain too much, so -- so\nlong we are healthy and together, that\u2019s the ma -- moment and I -- all the other things,\nforget it.

Yeah. Not three days, five days in\nlabor. Because I didn\u2019t walk all the time that I was pregnant. And so it\u2019s more things that\n-- that the -- the doctor didn\u2019t even touch me because I had scabien. So th-th-they didn\u2019t\neven look at me and -- and that was the first child and -- I mean, da -- da -- you cannot\ngive -- what happened really to us, in all this time, all these years and also after these\nyears, you cannot tell the suffering, what we did really. What -- what -- what they did to\nus. Even you come back to Holland, I remember I walked all over and -- and all the\nplaces where the whole family was and -- and it was nothing there. So -- so, not just the\nconcentration camp, but all the after on too. We -- we cannot tell what really happened to\nus. And we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t know -- we thank God we cannot tell it. Because that so\nmany people were telling the story, they crying and they crying. Perhaps we cannot sleep\ntonight. That can happen, from that we tell the story and we get nightmares.

        "Q: Okay.\nSE: I was born in Holland and I was the only girl for four children and the youngest and\nwhen I came in Poland, I met Chaim, we had to dance front the Germans, because it was\nkind of a sadism that the fire 1s burning and all the dead people got bur -- were burning\nthere and it was a -- smelled from smoke and -- and that\u2019s -- there was a sadism was some\nthat we had to dance under these circumstances.

        "Q: And did -- 1t seemed in the transcripts that you knew and in general, Polish Jews knew\na lot more than Selma, or than Dutch Jews about what was happening at first. Is that --\nCE: Well, well, we -- before even I came to Sobibor and we saw people go -- my father, a\nmatter of fact, came six months before me to Sobibor and he went to a camp, so the\nrumors were that people go to the -- to the gas chamber. But this was so\nincomprehensible that nobody won\u2019t believe it. But [indecipherable] when we came to\nthe camp -- a matter of fact I came with my brother and they pick me out to work and\nwhen he went to the gas chamber. So then we knew what\u2019s going on. So that was not any\nmore a rumors, there was facts, what happened. Separate --\nSE: [indecipherable] sort clothes, that you found the clothes for your -- for your brother\nand that\u2019s the reason -- the moment that you saw the pictures from your brother and\nthings like that.",

        "Q: And were you immediately separated?\nCE: Yeah. When we came out of the train, they separate, but I didn\u2019t know what picking\nout means. They picked out from transport, from about 1000 people, about 20. And I\nhappened to be with 20 from the 20 people. So by -- we didn\u2019t know what it means,\npicking out, but it meant to be working in camp.",
        "Q: Instead of?\nCE: Going to the gas chamber.",
        "Q: I know you\u2019ve had a long time to thing about this, but do you -- do you have any idea\nwhy they picked you?\nCE: No, he asked me -- what did he ask me, something -- where I come from and I told\nhim from where and he says, \u201cCome out.\u201d And that\u2019s it.

I was\nin -- in -- in Amsterdam in jail because -- in jail because I was hidden and that was a\npunishment. And so we met a whole bunch of Dutch young girls. The youngest was 16\nand I was the oldest, I was 20. So and -- and then we stayed together, we went to a\nconcentration camp in Holland first and then we went to Westerbork, where all the Jews\nwent through, then we went -- sent to Poland and we went in a freight train, it was the\nfirst freight train what went away from Westerbork. And there wen-went three days and\nthree nights in the train and when we came on, all the Germans were standing there and\nbecause we were all young girls, they took us on the side, where all -- the first transport\nwhere they took Dutch girls out. And they say, \u201cYou stuus, go stay on the side.\u201d And that\nwas It.",
        "Q: The side of the train?\nSE: No, we were already past the train. They were already off from the railroad station.\nWe passed already that we were standing there and then could we see that the women and\nthe children went straight to the gas chamber and the men had to sit on the side and they\nhad to take their shoes off and they have to bundle the shoes together because everything\nwas sent to Germany, so the shoes had to be together and not when they\u2019re loosed and get\nit lost. So -- and that we show, also that some German gave them a card and they had to\nwrite home that they came now in Sobibor and -- and that they are safe here.

But I want to say\nsomething else. You ask me a question. Oh, what language he spoke.

And he -- this man was in an office, on the way -- this office\n-- let me say here, when we walked here, we had to walk past this office and he was\nthere, so said Chaim, \u201cYou have to go. Because w -- are already so many killed, SS\u2019s",
        "Q: You -- you went in the office, also?\nCE: No.\nSE: No, I went in that -- in that building where all that food were -- a -- our things were\nand I\u2019d give him a knife and at once he was gone. And I was so upset, 1t was Chaim, it\nwas Chaim. So I li -- I went looking through this office and I hear screaming like -- oh,\nthere was a pig k-killing, so much noise. And he help, with another capo, a Jewish capo,\nhelped to kill this Baker.",
        "Q: And were -- this was not part of the plan?\nSE: No.\nCE: Not at all, there was -- because I -- as I say, I didn\u2019t had any assignment.",
        "Q: You what?\nCE: I didn\u2019t have any assignment that I have to kill somebody, but the situation was so\nlast minute, you do what you can to save the situation. Because w-we would have been\nkilled anyway, without the uprising, especially with an uprising, so it was just a question\nof -- of [indecipherable]. So, I figured, if the fellow want to go in, so I have to go and we\nwent together -- a matter of fact, the knife I slipped -- the knife I shoved -- knife I cut\nmyself and I came out, I was bleeding and Selma gave it -- she had a handkerchief, she\nbandaged me and it was full of blood. And we went to the front gate, aft --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s stay with the -- the killing a little bit, just because it\u2019s such a -- I know -- a\nterrible experience to -- first of all, you were not chosen to do that, but who was it that\ntold you to?\nCE: There is another fellow, as we said, he was assigned to go to do that. But he got\nafraid the last minute, so we didn\u2019t have anybody to go and it has to be, as she said, he\nwas in a place where we had to pass there and if we wouldn\u2019t have been, we would have\nbeen all in danger, so --\nSE: And if one person couldn\u2019t go -- that it was too much a job for one person, so one --\nch -- p -- Pazifski --\nCE: Pazifsk1.\nSE: Pazifski. That is in capo was that and he went, so he couldn\u2019t have done it alone, so\nhe --\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: -- had counted that somebody else comes there too, that was the --",
        "Q: A capo?\nSE: A capo what went there, he killed three other ones and then he went there and he got\nkilled later himself, he didn\u2019t came out. And -- and so Chaim went there and Chaim,\nwhen you killed that man --\nCE: Yeah, I said, it -- it\u2019s job with the knife, I said, \u201cThis for my father, for my brother,\nfor all the Jews which you killed,\u201d that\u2019s when I jabbed him with the knife.",
        "Q: So you killed him with a knife?",
        "Q: He did with somebody else.\nCE: The other one -- was another fellow too, he stabbed him too with the knife.",
        "Q: The capo?\nCE: The capo yeah, both -- we both did it.\nSE: And you know, also, the reason that we know for sure there would something\nhappened, th -- lately the camp got very big, we had to build up lots of barracks and --\nand it got -- they build it up that 100 -- 100 people could sleep there. So we se -- we\nknow for sure there\u2019s something going on. And it -- and there came no transports, there\nwere no transports any more. And the Germans -- they were already pulling back. So we\nthought they\u2019re building perhaps for the Germans in camp. And so we were -- we know\nthat -- and it was something that was not s-safe and we know thewas was going on. So\nthat\u2019s the reason also that -- that they pushed it more and many Russian militaire came to\ncamp and he wants to run away the first day what he saw what is going on and that\nhelped all -- of course, too. When it was o -- the reason was also that they made the camp\nvery big and a lot of Jewish people came also there, from Minsk and so, we thought, why\nare they building so much? It so does -- and it wa -- there came no transports, so the\ncamp was really not necessary for the Jews any more. So that\u2019s the reason also that we --\nthat they thought it 1s very important that there 1s an uprising.",
        "Q: And y-you seemed to know right away that they were talking about it, but then when\nit became to a plan, they did not share it with you, or -- how did you find out?\nCE: No, as I say, I have the friends, what they were involved in and I knew always what\nwas going on. So I knew about everything what\u2019s going on, so.",
        "Q: Did you know that they were meeting, many of their underground meetings happen at\nthe women\u2019s barracks?\nCE: Yeah, yeah they -- I met -- I -- I know -- I knew about whatever was talk about them\n-- the uprising, I knew everything about. But, as I say, I didn\u2019t want directly involved in\nit, because -- that was becau-because my friends were in it, but the - -the head of the\nuprising, he made restrictions, how many people, because it was -- kept it so secretly, if it\ncomes out, it\u2019s the end of it, so.",
        "Q: Must be hard to keep a secret in a camp.\nCE: That\u2019s right. People get desperate and people talk too much about and there comes\nout too -- too quick.",
        "Q: And the feelings you have had since about -- how did it feel to kill someone, because\nyou ju --\nCE: You are not amont, you -- you live differently in a situation like that. You don\u2019t\nthink you -- five minutes ahead. You just live on the moment. You do what you have to\ndo this minute. That is -- that is way you act, we -- because you know your death is any\nminute before you, so --",
        "Q: And did you use the knife that Selma gave you, or did you have a knife?",
        "Q: It broke off in the body of the -- of the SS?\nCE: No, I slipped. Slipped in my hand there.\nSE: I thought that the knife broke off a piece.\nCE: No.\nSE: Oh.\nCE: No.\nSE: We never talked about it and we never go join the [indecipherable]. There\u2019s a part\nwhere we don\u2019t talk much about it.",
        "Q: Yeah, I -- I know. I\u2019m only asking for to clarify anything, any little detail that you\nmight remember, might help to clarify this story, you know, so.\nCE: I -- I think that what we told you, there should be clar -- clear tha now.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay, the -- the other part I would talk about now, how -- how you got out at\nthe gate and where you were in relation to everyone else who was running and the mines\nand --\nCE: Well, when we came back from work, when we c --",
        "Q: And were you with a group at first?\nSE: No.\nCE: No, we were always [inaudible]\nSE: Just were the two of us. We were just with the two of us. We run and run and run, we\nwere just with the two of us. And --\nCE: Again we -- the thing that -- we were in the woods for an hour, maybe something, we\nfound another group -- a group of our other inmates which ran away and they had some\nrifles and --\nSE: But we just told this story.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: That we -- just told you the story that they want to shoot Chaim and then I jumped in\nfront of him and then they didn\u2019t shoot him. I jumped --",
        "Q: Why would they want to shoot him?\nSE: Because they didn\u2019t want me. They were afraid for some Dutch woman what -- what\n-- what will they do with somebody who -- what doesn\u2019t speak Polish and not Yiddish?\nSo they want to get rid of me, that\u2019s what we think, we don\u2019t know. Anyway, we went\nfarther just with the two of us.\nCE: That they didn\u2019t want us.\nSE: Yeah\nCE: That they didn\u2019t want us. So we just --",
        "Q: It was too many more, or?\nCE: Yeah. Well, I don\u2019t know the reasons. Anyway, they didn\u2019t want us, so we decided\nto go on our own. I was thinking, because I -- as I said, I worked as a farmer before I\ncame to Sobibor, I thought maybe I go in this direction. So --\nSE: We walked with the stars.\nCE: We walked --\nSE: Out the stars, was a lot of stars and when it was night we walked and in daytime we\nwere hiding in the woods or in an -- ha-haystock or -- sometime -- once we went stayed\nwith another farmer what Chaim give him money, again. So we -- we slept outside and\nwe eat the things what we saw on the -- on the field. Til we came one day -- and we don\u2019t\nknow really the time, it was 10 days or something like that, til we came by a farmer.\nChaim ask him if auseda -- 1f we could stay there.",
        "Q: By we, who do you mean?\nCE: We. I -- [ran away. When we -- the people ran away, probably all of us did the same\nthing.",

And from there,\nChaim start working on the field with the man, because I couldn\u2019t walk, so thought\nperhaps when I learn a little bit walking again. And til one day, the farmer said, \u201cYou\nknow, you have to go away,\u201d because they hear that are Jews here and the-they -- they --\nwe -- he was afraid that they want to kill us.

        "Q: And you moved to another place?\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Now we went to Helm. In Helm there were all the Jews what -- I thought we were\nthe only Jews what were alive, because I thought every camp is like Sobibor. And it was\noh, a hundred people came there, to that house and we slept in a single bed, we didn\u2019t\nhadn\u2019t have nothing. We had no money, we had no clothes and we were very weak and\nwe came there and Chaim started working and they had the -- Chaim had to go in the\narmy, the Russian -- in Polish army. So Chaim started working in the hospital as a nurse,\nhe doesn\u2019t know se -- he doesn\u2019t even know how -- how blood looks. And I started\nsewing for people. No, I started first cooking in the kitchen and then I burned my foot.\nAnd then I started sewing for people to make some money and we made some money,\njust to live on. And then we had -- 1t was somebody what the -- all the Jews went back to\nSobibor because the -- gesundheit -- and all the Jews went back to Sobibor, a lot of\npeople went back to Sobibor, because the only sabotage which you could do in camp was\nha -- taking the money what came in, fr-from the people that went into the gas chamber\nand they hide it in the ground. So they went back to Sobibor to find that money. Well,\nthere was a lot of money hidden all over.",

        "Q: You mean Jewish people? All the Jewish people?\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Ye -- All -- all Jews and not Jews, everybody, everybody. So one wom -- man had\ndol -- gold dollars and it was the number was gone.

We don\u2019t know who. So the man didn\u2019t believe us, of course and so\nwe -- Chaim made some money, he gave it to him. Now 10 years later, we live in Israel\nand is in a whole group of people from Sobibor coming together. And I say to the man,\n\u201cDo you remember, the hundred dollar for you, it was under my pillow, that -- that w-we\n-- somebody stole it under?\u201d And the next day he was there, he says you owe me hundred\ndollar -- dollar.",
        "Q: He said, you owe him?\nSE: Hundred dollars for the hundred dollars was stolen and --\nCE: So anyway, that\u2019s beside the story too far away. So --\nSE: No, that is co-connected with the whole thing that it -- ot later, you [indecipherable]\nany more.\nCE: Yeah, then we had somebody, you know, a Frenchman, what is his name?",
        "Q: This was an apartment house?\nSE: No, was a whole house. Was a whole -- just a house, like this.",

Then we start -- we went away -- were freight trains and we\ntrekked from one town to the other an-and in every town we found was some Jews what\nlived there, where we could sleep overnight. So, one day, we f -- met a man, it was a fr --\nsomebody from France and he was also a survivor from Sobibor and he told us, \u201cYou\nknow, I -- I was -- I live in a town,\u201d -- Chaim had to go in the army, in the Polish army.\nAnd said he, \u201cI live in a town,\u201d Partsiff was the name of the town, \u201cand there\u2019s a Jewish\nwoman and she owns a lot of houses.

Here were also -- were also like skoltchmids, tailors and shoemakers\nand the Germans, they usually work for the Germans, yeah. They usually work --\nSE: No, looks here, here --\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: -- here [indecipherable] that\u2019s where the German live.\nCE: They usually --\nSE: Here\u2019s the tailors and the -- and the goldsmith. Here was the sh-shops. And here\u2019s\nwhere the man slept and here\u2019s where the women slept.\nSE: They start already shooting all over, from ou -- every side. Did you tell the -- oh.\nCE: That\u2019s all right.\nSE: When we -- Chaim say to me, \u201cYou have to be in four o\u2019clock by,\u201d -- there was a --\nand one building there were older -- m-medicine and all the little things was 1n that\nbuilding. So, said he\u2019d be -- on four o\u2019clock -- where was the building, here? I don\u2019t\nknow where the building was.\nkilled, when you don\u2019t go, we\u2019re dead anyway.\u201d So, he didn\u2019t want to go, so Chaim went\ninstead of him. So Chaim stayed and I went inside and took a knife --\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Yeah, but not alone --\nCE: Not, the --\nCE: No, no, that is the knife she gave me. I didn\u2019t have a knife.\nSE: It was a bread knife. Was just an ordinary bread knife.\nCE: [inaudible] knife.\nSE: Yeah. It broke off\nCE: No, it broke off, I cut myself here.\nSE: I know that, too.\nSE: [indecipherable]\nCE: When we came back from work, we -- as I say, we walked normally like always,\nafter working in a -- all odly way -- we went back and we came to the main gate, where\nwe lived, through -- through here -- through here, over to here is the gate over here.\nAnyway, we came back there and there was, as I say, a big confusion, everyone 1s\nstanding. A lot of people ran on to mines and got killed there. A lot of people ran to the\nfront gate and dustare got killed there, too. Somehow we ran to the front gate and we\nwere lucky, we came out of the --\nSE: They started shooting already.\nCE: And there was --\nSE: Franzel started shooting already.\nCE: [indecipherable] started shooting way ahead time, because there were some rifles,\nsome of the people from the camp, they were -- already had some rifles. So they were\nalso shooting. So the chairman, Franzel, he had a ha -- an emerald in his hands, yeah?\nSE: [indecipherable] pail, I sawsee in the front of him. And also the people on the towers,\nthey starting shooting too.\nCE: Yeah. So anyway, we went to the front gate and we got out of the front gate.\nSE: Over you hear, on the -- on the -- on both sides you hear the mines falling -- and that\npeople falling on the mines. So you hear that on both sides.\nCE: We ran as fast --\nSE: We heard screaming.\nCE: Yeah, we ran as fast as we can -- we had --\nSE: And shooting in back of us.\nCE: We had still a quarter of mile we had to clear, to the woods, because from the\nentrance to the camp, til there was still about a quarter of a mile and it was raining, I\nthink, or something. It was raining.\nSE: [inaudible]\nCE: And we came in the woods and so we start to ran as far as we can, but it seems we\ndidn\u2019t go too far. Was the whole night running, we were about four miles away from --\nfrom camp.\nCE: We had -- when -- before we ran away from the camp, we were thinking about\nsometimes they ran away. So we were hiding valuables, what we found in the luggage,\nlike gold, diamonds, money, things like that. We were hiding it over at this fireman\u2019s\nplace. The fireman -- because there was everything fire burning, so we brought some\nvaluables sometimes and he was hiding in the ground. When we ran away, then we can\ntake it with us. Now, before we ran away, the day we sort of go to ran away, we took all\nthese things what we put away and put it with bandages on our legs, so we had money\nand valuable things we had with us.\nvaluables with us. So when we ran away and we came to people, we wanted to be hidden.\nSo we offered them, we said, \u201cWhatever we have,\u201d and we showed them what we have,\nif they go to keep us, say, \u201cCan I have everything?\u201d Til one day, we came to a farmer, he\nwas very nice to us and he says -- we ask him the question of he wants to keep us or the\nmoney. He said, \u201cI cannot do it, but I have a brother what lives about 10 kilometers noss -\n- away from me and he lives on little more isolated place, he probably willing to do it.\u201d\nAnd he took us, he put hay on a wagon -- this atop was an old lady and me he put on olm\nwagon, excuse me and -- and covered me with branches and he drove us to his brother.\nNow, that was very dangerous, because if the -- on the road was caught us, we all would\nhave been dead on the spot. Also his family, which was very --\nSE: Caring.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A\nlong we didn\u2019t wash ourself and -- it -- 1t was a ver-very difficult time. Very, very\ndifficult time. But still it was tremendous what he did, because he could shoot a -- shoot\nus too, like Chaim\u2019s friend, what was on the fireman, he went to a farmer and the farmer\nsay, \u201cYeah, I will take care of you, you can stay here.\u201d And in the middle in the night he\nwent to him and killed him with a hayfork and took all the money what he had.\nCE: We were at the farmer and -- matter of fact, a day before the Russian came, is -- is\nthe children -- not the children --\nSE: No, d-day before the Russian came, there was some birds and they flying up where\nwe were hidden. And there was all children playing and they went -- run after these birds\nand at once they saw us. When they came on top of us and we were hidden there. So they\nwent downstairs, but it was already the whol -- there were a lot of people already there,\nbecause they ran away from the Germans, like Polnisha people and so that was our\nsafety, because the next day the German came and --\nCE: The Russian came.\nSE: The Russian came and freed us. So, thank God that was -- just happen. So thank God\nit was -- just happen. Ma -- the ti-time that we were hidden, once also that we moved,\nwhen we were laying on straw on the -- on the roo -- a-above the cows. So yavae you\nmove a little bit that you can here and we moved and somebody was there and he say,\n\u201cWhat is upstairs?\u201d And he say there\u2019s some birds or something like that. So at that time,\nwhen he slept, I was not allowed to sleep and we were very careful that nobody could\nhear, so we had to lay very, very quiet and always when we were sleeping and we\ncouldn\u2019t talk, only whisper. And we couldn\u2019t walk. So, 1-1t -- it was very, very difficult,\nvery difficult, nine months long. After the war, when I started walking, I was so weak\nthat I couldn\u2019t not -- almost not walk. And when I said -- and when the war was over and\nI came out, I was six months pregnant, but I didn\u2019t know. And a woman from the family\nsaw it on me, ma -- we say no, no, no, no. And she --\nSE: Well, we gave them all the money, so we didn\u2019t have anything. Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s\nwas -- dusun --\nSE: Yeah.\nCE: If they were caught us, they will all be killed. It was very dangerous.\nSE: Yes, it\u2019s very, very dangerous.\nSE: No, I ti -- I was in the six months, so I had three months now to go.\nSE: So, they were killing each other. So he didn\u2019t go. I said, Chaim, we made it so far, we\nwill -- we\u2019ll make it without the money.\nSE: No and then we -- we -- we were in Helm and -- and we couldn\u2019t stay there, because\nwe lived in a very small area, with hundred people and -- and -- a --\nmustache and say I think a few years younger or f -- older, older. Then you don\u2019t have to\ngo in the army.\u201d And so that\u2019s what he did. And we went with this French man to the --\ntoo much, because it doesn\u2019t drip under the bed.\u201d And they didn\u2019t give us anything to eat\nand it -- it was -- it was horrible. So I\u2019ve -- that was -- are still very anti-Semitic.\nSE: Yeah, I named him Federant -- F-Freddie. No, a-amy -- Em-Emanuel, because\nChaim\u2019s father\u2019s name was Samuel and my father\u2019s name was Samuel. So we called him\nEm-Eman-Enam-Emilchi-Emilchi we called him. And he -- it was a very health -- it was\nan healthy child, was very small. When the Polish -- was more Polish Jews in that little\nvillage, Partsiv and they came and they say, pf-pf-pft -- in that -- in Holland they don\u2019t do\nthat. And that means th-th-the me -- ghost -- there will be the bad ghost blowing away,\nbecause the baby was so small. The typical Jewish things that they say, pfft -- tu-tu. The\nba -- the bad things, they will move away. So Chaim was always traveling to make some\nmoney. He went on a train and traveled far away to make some money to b-bought stuff\nfrom where the German moved away and they sold it by us, because that was the only\nway that -- what could he do? So --\nSE: No, nobody speaks German in Poland, nobody. So it-it was -- and I didn\u2019t speak\nYiddish, so with the few Yiddish peo -- Jewish people I couldn\u2019t speak with, when they s\n-- s-speak German, so it was a very miserable time. So this girl Ula came to live with us.\ntransportation. I went with fate wagons, I just tried to -- like hijacking, but -- not high --\nnot hiyacking.\nSE: Yeah.\ndrunk, I slept the whole day, I slept whi -- during the day, I happasli all day. And so that\nwas once happen --\nSE: And when you woke up, they stole everything from you.\nCE: Yeah, there was --\nSE: Yeah, there was. Oh yeah, there was.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Oh yeah, there was.\nCE: The helper to this Friedlander, he was a son of a rabbi, he was one of the organizers\non the uprising and he kept up with the things. He -- he -- when Yom Kippur was -- you\nknow, when Yom Kippur date -- on day of Atonement. And he kept up this kind of thing,\nbut we --\nSE: You know, we went away from that village, was it not that we want to --\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: The partisan or the not Jewish partisan what lived in the woods, they want to kill all\nthe Jews what lived in that village. So, middle in the night we went away and we went to\nLublin. And then we went to -- in Lublin, to a Jewish fellow what ran away from camp.\nMet somebody else.\nCE: And he was one, yeah he was one of the search for this survivors. And he later lived\nin --\nSE: Yeah, [indecipherable] Lublin.\nCE: -- in Vineland.\nSE: Yeah. We stayed with him.\nCE: We came to stay in his house.\nSE: And del Chaim heard about the Dutch cap-captain dat in -- in Lublin so -- he met\nsomebody and -- and they told him that they are going to -- met a train, they are going\nfarther and they will try to get over -- I don\u2019t know what they say to you, what did they\nsay to you?\nCE: Well, there was a lot of Dutch prisoners of war, somehow they came to be there. And\nth-the captain told me that they were a transport for this prisoners of war, that they can go\nback to Holland. Now, the war was still going on -- this Warsaw was -- was 0 -- the only\nway they could go is through Odessa, through the Black Sea around Europe, to the Black\nSea to Marseilles, to France.\nCE: Czernowitz\nSE: In Czernowitz and we stayed in Czernowitz 1n -- in an camp, with the -- with Gypsies\nand -- and I was very sick and the baby was very sick from diftary -- dif -- no, dysentery.\nthat we came back go to the train, but on the train we\u2019ll fitta. The train went to Odessa, til\nOdessa. And -- and -- and Odessa and what was in Odessa?\nSE: In Odessa we were -- three months were we in Odessa. And it was -- that\u2019s the first\ntime that we hear something from the Red Cross. We never heard anything from the Red\nCross before and we -- they brought some food, the now -- the -- now we get good food\nand the baby got normal food and we got clo -- no, we don\u2019t get -- ge -- any clothes.\nThere were more German people what say they were -- o-okay in the war and they got\neverything. So by -- the baby got very healthy and it was very beautiful on the Black Sea\nand we could go -- and who was it too, the father of Anna Frank was there 1s there, in that\nsame group of people.\nSE: Red Cross brought stuff there. Not that we saw them at that -- wethum -- we got food\nand we got everything. It was ve-very good. And after three months, Chaim was not\nallowed to go away from Pol -- from Russia. He was smuggled on the boat. So -- so --\nSE: Yeah, but he was so much older, so I didn\u2019t know that he would be once famous --\nwhen he would have known that he would be more famous, I would have gone to him.\nBut he was so much older that I was not really --\nSE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nCE: On -- all the station where they stopped, when we passed there, they were -- they\ncame with wine, you remember?\nSE: Yeah, yeah.\nCE: In Fr -- in France, 1n the stations, where we passed it over -- they came with wine,\ngave us, you know --\nSE: And food.\nCE: And food.\nSE: And they made a dinner for us, I remember, with white tablecloths, we had a dinner\nthere, somewhere. Oh, so many years ago. And then we went to Belgier, that was not so\nnice and then we came to Holland.\nhad a kosher hotel in Zwolle, in town in Holland and that was still there. So we went first\nand got an guarantee --\nCE: Quarantine. What do you mean?\nSE: Where we went in the school, when we were not allowed to go out.\nCE: Quaran-Quarantine.\nwalking.\u201d So I came to the hotel and the Germans were in the hotel for my father and\nmother, and --\n- he had the location and we had the license and together we start the business and we did\nvery well in this business.\nSE: Til he swindled Chaim for all the money what he had. There was some -- there was\nthe Korean War started out and business got a little bit slower and I don\u2019t remember\nexactly what he did, but anyway, we just came out with our own money. And --\nSE: We got married once in Poland, then we went to the town hall and changed our\nname.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: And then -- that -- 1t didn\u2019t come from the Dutch government and then we got\nmarried in *45 or \u201846.\nCE: Yeah. We were -- as I say, we were freed already because we were on the side of --\nfrom this side, is the Vexua -- for the river, the wall was by Warsaw. And so the sides\nfrom Russia was freed already, they see -- because they\u2019re free, because we were in \u201844\nfreed and the war ended in \u00b045. So the war was still stagnated -- s-stalemate -- a\nstalemate, there was -- th-there were not -- not -- didn\u2019t move, nothing happened. Til in\n\u201845 when the Russian -- Russian moved further to Berlin, things like that\n[indecipherable], so we -- we were freed already, although the war was not yet over\ncompletely.\nSE: Yeah, we told you that before. But --\ndid it. So, from that time, I had to every week to the police and melk myself, because I\nwas in str -- in -- anoth -- Dutch cit --\nCE: Foreigner.\nSE: I was a foreigner, I was not a Dutch citizen any more.\nSE: Oh yeah. No, they remember our family. My -- there were not many Jews left and\nthere were a lot of people what went with the Germans. So, it -- 1t was -- you didn\u2019t\nknow, people that you thought were your friend were really not your friends. So we were\nvery lonely, really, in that time. So we started the textile business and we did very well,\nwe builded a house and we lived a little bit above our I-level. We bought too much,\nbeautiful furniture -- was not my idea, was the -- my husband\u2019s partner\u2019s idea. And I\ndidn\u2019t want this, but I didn\u2019t have anything to say, so they did everything for me. So, one\nday, when the Korean war started out, th-the store didn\u2019t do that well, and the man what\nhe has his partner what I know was not a nice person when he started with him, he was\ndesperate, Chaim. He swindled us for everything. And in Holland, it\u2019s very hard to start\nanything. For everything what you do, you have to have a license. When you will start a\ntextile store or you want to start a vegetable store or you want to start anything, you have\nthe license. Only not with the ice cream. So Chaim could buy a business in ice cream and\nin something else.\nCE: [inaudible]\nSE: In Breedan, another town. So he -- I had two little babies, so I didn\u2019t want to go with\nhim and he went by himself and he came weekends home. And it didn\u2019t do well, so we\nlost also that money that we had -- we lost also in that business. So I -- I see -- I was\nalways a Zionist. I always wanted to go to Israel. I think --and I had an uncle was a\ndoctor and he went to Israel and he say, \u201cCome to us, oh I am much happier, whatever do\nyou do here.\u201d And we have no choice also, it was very hard for Chaim to be -- go back to\nschool, we had two little children, how you going to go back to school? We had to make\na living. Nobody ever helped us. Oh, we got some money from the Dutch government,\nfor -- that they stole everything in the hotel. So, davide -- divided with my brother. So --\nCE: \u00b046 and \u201848\nparents would never have allowed us -- only girl -- that I would go there. So then in --\nand after the war, when my uncle, my only uncle what I had the [indecipherable] was not\na real uncle, was a second cousin, was a cousin from my father -- from my mother. So,\nthen he went to Israel and --\nhad stencils made from letters that we could write to people back, that we just had to no -\n- put notes in it. We paid everything for ourselve always.\nCE: I think so, because that was involved, everything, as we talked about, you needed a\nlicense for everything. And I was always in -- in business and I -- I had to go study again\nto get this license, it was a process maybe of two or three years. And there was too much\nfor me.\nSE: We have no money, so we couldn\u2019t afford it.\nCE: And also -- of the money, we -- yeah, the money we [indecipherable] lost a lot of\nmoney, so that -- that made it -- we thought we -- when we tried to go to Israel, as we\nwere pictured, what it will -- we get there, I thought ideal -- that we could live there and\nforget about business, but --\nCE: To -- it belonged to the --\nSE: Yeah, to the kibbutz.\nCE: To the organization, whatever it --\nSE: With all the neighboring, the [indecipherable]\nCE: So we worked just on the land and then you got -- you got whatever -- whatever got\nequal to live on it, you got a certain income, whatever it is, but the -- the land didn\u2019t\nbelong to you, nothing belonged to you.\nkibbutz and he had to work in the field and later he worked with the chickens, but he\nhated it too. And I worked also in the fields, we had to pick apples, but I thought -- I\nloved it, because it was for Israel, I build it up and I -- I was very idealistic and I -- I just\nloved it. I got an -- that handkerchief around my head and I was 28 years old and -- and --\nand I didn\u2019t have to sit the slofes with the kids the whole day, I did go to work and so --\nand so we worked in the field also, picking grapes in the summer and later I had to bake\nbreads in the -- for the people wh -- in the kibbutz. I had to go at two o\u2019clock at night in\nthe winter and made dough. I never made bread before in my life, but they told me how\nto do it and I had to go in the mud til my knees and it wa -- it was very muddy there, was\nno street or anything and sometimes I fell. And then six o\u2019clock in the morning I had to\nbake the -- make the dough the -- make the dough and put it in the oven.\nSE: No, nothing. Absolutely nothing. You\u2019re just working, he was dead tired. Wh -- he\ncome home, he went to bed, it was just -- that was all we co -- did.\nSE: No. Four, five years old. Four years old or six years old.\nCE: [indecipherable] They were born in \u201846 and \u201848 and we were in \u201851, we came.\nSE: One. We [indecipherable] in \u201851.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: So they were five, six, six years old. Six years old and eight years old.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Yeah, so and then I worked in the field and he was always out. We brought with us\nfrom Holland, lots of food and lots of clothes when we thought we\u2019d stay our lifelong in\na kibbutz. And so we brought vitters, everything will 10 ti -- for 10 years ahead.\nwant to have very much that Anglo-Saxon come there. So they helped us too and they\ngave us some money, borrow.\nfor Chaim -- that he went out of a camp and it\u2019s a whole story and that he\u2019s unhappy\nthere and this man who 1s a stranger, gives an affidavit. And met this --\nCE: You know what an affidavit is?\nSE: That\u2019s a real cousin.\nSE: I wasn\u2019t -- not -- de -- because wh -- the circumstance make my unhappy, that we had\nno -- didn\u2019t make -- couldn\u2019t make a living. Because he could find something to do what\nhe could do and was happy. So that way -- that was also the reason that ve -- va -- and\ndone what a -- what we have in Holland. No, I -- that\u2019s the best thing we ever did, that we\nwent away from Holland. I\u2019m thank God -- I\u2019m very happy that we went away from\nHolland. That\u2019s the best thing we ever did.\nCE: There was no -- any difference.\nSE: No, there was not -- no, was no problem.\nCE: No.\nSE: No, no, no. He\u2019s a very nice guy, so like they -- everybody likes him better than they\nlike me.\nSE: Yeah, with the four children, yeah. And he sold everything and he moved to Canada.\nSo we thought we go to my brother. But my brother --\nCE: Yeah, with the whole family. And we didn\u2019t have yet a house, nothing. And they\nlived in a very small house, and they took us in their house and we lived there for a week,\nI think. We rented a house --\nSE: An apartment.\nCE: An apartment.\nSE: For only 25 dollars a week -- a months.\nCE: Yeah in -- in Westport and he --\nSE: [inaudible], when we sold the vegetable store, we thought it\u2019s better for the children\nthat we don\u2019t go by plane, and we go by boat. It has a smaller -- it has a longer time for\nthe -- the -- you know, to go over for the hot country --\nCE: [indecipherable]\nSE: So we went to Italy -- we went to Genoa and -- and we stayed there three weeks. And\nwas very nice, but both got very sick.\nSE: Yeah.\nCE: Yeah, the sist -- the sister came.\nSE: And -- and Trudy.\nCE: And Trudy too. Yeah, they came --\nSE: [indecipherable] and they picked us up.\nCE: They picked us up.\nabout. Anyway, I struggled through about nine months and then I already planned to do\nsomething else, because that 1s not what I wanted to do. So, they had Arnold\u2019s bread, you\nknow Arnold\u2019s bread? Arnold\u2019s bread has the routes. You buy a route, like a franchise.\nYou buy a route, you have it -- your own truck and you deliver to different stores and --\nand | -- if somebody what came to -- from Arnold\u2019s to this -- to Cristida\u2019s, he wants to\nsell his route. So we bought -- bought -- I bought this route. I bought this route from him.\nCE: Yeah. And I look constantly, went to brokers, I looked in newspapers. Take one day,\nI saw a store in Stamford, it was for sale. Now, I didn\u2019t know it that was a new\ndevelopment in that time.\nSE: He didn\u2019t know anything about the new development or things like that.\nCE: Anyway, we --\nSE: They were -- were 10 and 12 when they came to America. So they are now 14 or 15,\nsomething like that.\nCE: Something like that.\nSE: And the ki -- when the -- when the kids were small and -- and I told the kids about\ncamp of something like that and Ch -- and the minute Chaim came in, we stopped. So, I\nsort of thought I didn\u2019t tell the children much. And when I say to my son, \u201cDid I ever told\nyou something about camps?\u201d Said he, \u201cAlways.\u201d So --\nSE: We have no -- no friends what are survivors. Absolute none. We have only American\nfriends. We have one couple what are Dutch, we came together what is from Israel and\nthey were hidden in Holland. So we have no friends and we don\u2019t belong to an\norganization. What has to do with Holocaust -- we just do talking in schools and as\nvolunteer -- volunteer of course, we don\u2019t get paid for it. And we are not -- what do we\nhave to talk about it? They have to tell their story? Their story is worse than our story, I\nmean -- we have nothing to tell. Wha -- we told on the Holoc -- we told for the\nWashington and we did here in Yale, is in -- in --\nwas in it and -- yeah we wait -- went 1n to see the -- also, we paid for ourself, we always\npaid everything ourself. We didn\u2019t get any money from anybody. Only when we went to\nthe trials in Germany, the German government paid for the tr -- the trip and living there,\nin Germany.\nand say hi. Because, you know, yo-you were scared to death, you don\u2019t know what\nyou\u2019re doing. So --\ndidn\u2019t -- we had not a good job there, that we could go from one place to the other and\nthe other two that had a good job there, they could see perhaps more, we don\u2019t know. So\nwe didn\u2019t have so much to say and we just always say -- when we tell something, what\nwe remember now. We don\u2019t tell anything what we thought it would be this way. So we\ndidn\u2019t -- Chaim had to say something -- was in -- Chaim -- was a dentist -- Chaim saw\nthis 1s --\nCE: Well, you see, the Germans they wouldn\u2019t -- they were not punished alone, because\nthey were in a camp. You have to see that they did something, killed somebody or -- or\nmistreated somebody, then they were punished. At least big and I saw the Franzel, he\nshot somebody, a dentist, Presnol I think his name. For no reason, he shot him. And I\ntestified that in court. She pulled me though, motim, affpreds. Anyway, so I testified that\nhe shot this man and because of that he got 25 years in prison.\nSE: -- they told, so perhaps they told something, too.\nCE: Yeah, anyway.\nCE: Oh.\nSE: Do you remember that?\nCE: I tell you -- you tell the story, you --\nSE: No, but it was -- he talked to you.\nCE: Selma, you think I remember that? I [indecipherable]\nSE: The lawyer from Franzel came to Chaim and he say to Chaim -- do you remember --\nand, \u201cThat is not true,\u201d but if that guy said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him even. We know it is true\nthat there was an Holocaust.\u201d That was the lawyer for Franzel say that.\nCE: Some of the children. There was one or two asked questions like that. But in general,\nI think was a good reception. Because the teacher prepared them for -- I assumed they\ntold them something.\nSE: There was a lot of German kids what went to the trial. They had to go to the trials. A\nlot of Germans high school kids that went to the trials, every day.\nCE: Yeah, yeah, they were -- they were in the court.\nSE: Yeah.\nCE: As --\nSE: Listening.\nCE: Listening, yeah.\nSE: But the 70\u2019s we lived already here and we didn\u2019t go to Germany any more.\nCE: Sure we were upset to --\nSE: Very upset.\nCE: Yeah, with all the prejudice and things like that, what we know what it 1s.\nSE: We couldn\u2019t understand it, because in Holland were not black people, in Poland\nwere not black people and in Israel when we lived, there were no black people and we\ncouldn\u2019t understand the whole situation -- we didn\u2019t understand how can people be so\ncruel? How ca -- how can something like -- happen like that? We were very upset about\nthat.\nCE: Not mine. Let me talk for one second, not mine.\nthan they are now. But I don\u2019t -- when I don\u2019t go to the synagogue, is okay with me too.\nWe belong to the synagogue and we pay for it, because we think that\u2019s important. I don\u2019t\nknow why he thinks that it\u2019s important, but -- it costs a lot of money. But we don\u2019t go\nmuch. We don\u2019t like the rabbi, so we don\u2019t go much at all. And -- and I don\u2019t miss it. I\nmiss people. I miss terrible -- ivenna_ would be a Jewish club of a Jewish cen -- a Jewish\ncenter here in the neighborhood, I would go there. I miss it.\nSE: We went to a synagogue with an couple.\nCE: Yeah, because it\u2019s nice to go. But we don\u2019t go ov -- often. But we went -- once in\nawhile we go.\nSE: I tell you the truth, we happy that we are together and that we still are together. He\u2019s\n82, I\u2019m 76 next month and we just happy to be together. And we have some Jewish\nfriends, we go to the movie, we go to a concert, we go to plays. And also the val, we go\nto New York. And we like Opera. So -- oh, we went to la -- an elder hostel last week, of\ntwo weeks ago. And we just -- so long as we are together, we enjoy each other company,\nsometimes.\nCE: What do you expect after so many years, always?\nSE: Iam very bitter about what happened and that the Dutch people, that they think,\nbecause of the Anna Frank, that they think the Dutch people were very good -- after the\nwar, but I\u2019m very bitter that -- like that my whole family got killed, my -- I had -- my\nmother had eight brothers and sisters, my father had seven brothers and sisters. And --\nand they were all married and they had all children and is nobody alive -- on -- two\ncousins what I have in Israel. And they\u2019re -- they\u2019re gone. And this week we talked about\nit and why I suffer so much, because -- they were never sick, we never had an -- an grave\nwhere we could go to. They just gone. Like off the -- they\u2019re gone -- in the woods, if they\nwalking an-and I think that 1s it, that -- that make you so bitter, that they just gone. They\njust taken out of your life and they never came back. And that is very hard -- very hard\nfor me. And for Chaim, too. I don\u2019t know -- he expresses himself not so, about it.\nCE: Well, you said it good.\nSE: If I saw now that I -- when I came back after the war, I had the seamstress and she\nwas the foulks German. I had some girlfriends from school, they were foulks Germans.\nSE: Ma, I did -- because I didn\u2019t know. Later, after that he was free, I hear about that. But\nit -- but how come that so many Dutch Jews got killed? My whole family got killed. I\nhave nobody in Holland left. So, I wonder wh -- that I don -- that there has to be\nsomething in Holland what was not kosher, not good. B-Because how could it be that --\nthat -- that -- the percenta -- percentage -- more Jews got killed than in any other country,\ne-even I think percentiz-centage-wise | down in Poland. So di -- so, what is the reason?\nAnd that I said -- I said, widid the night -- sometimes I cannot sleep from it. And, because\nHolland, they think, Holland didn\u2019t help us anything, absolutely nothing. We couldn\u2019t get\na house after the war, we came back. The Dutch government didn\u2019t help us at all. He had\nto go back -- from the first month, he had to go back to Poland an-and everybody knows\nhow he suffered. They didn\u2019t trust us, because when we came back to Holland, because\nwe were already a year free. How come that we\u2019re not sick like other people that came\nback f-from concentration camps? Holland was terrible to us. We didn\u2019t have any --\nanything out of a Dutch -- that\u2019s for 200 years my family lived in Holland. And no, I\u2019m --\nthat\u2019s the best thing ever did in my life, that we went away from Holland. The best thing.\nCE: Yeah, you said it good [inaudible]\nSE: Yeah. That\u2019s the way I think.\nCE: That\u2019s the truth.\nSE: Our granddaughter, Tagin, went to Israel and when she was in Israel -- she went and\nstayed there for an half year, she we -- wanted to go to Poland. So she went to Poland\nalone and traveled around in Poland, went to concentration camp and went to Sobibor,\nwent to -- to the people where we were hidden. And then she went to Lodz. And Chaim\nmother died in 1936 and we never know there was an grave from his mother. Because we\nhear that everything -- Chaim never went back to Lodz, he never wanted to go back. So\nshe found the grave for my -- Chaim\u2019s mother and she made pictures from it and -- and it\nwas very e-emotional for us, that we know that -- and it was -- we -- and Jewish people\nput a stone on the -- little stone -- they put it on the stone, that they can see that somebody\nthinks about them. And when she --\nCE: By the way, this -- the people what helped us, where we\u2019re hidden, they both died.\nYou told her the story?\nSE: No, the man.\nCE: The man, the -- what -- we\u2019re hiding, the brother what brought us and the brother we\nwere hiding, they live in a -- lived any more, but we -- financially we send them a few\ntimes a year, some money, whatever we can.\nSE: Lots of money we send them.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Yeah.\nSE: You know, if -- when all the Jews came back in Helm, everybody tells the story, so\nwe told the story that we give money -- we thought it was a lot of money, we don\u2019t know\nhow much it was, it was some diamonds and gold -- gold -- thing 1s so, how much can it\nbe? Chaim had it in -- 1n some glass case, you know? So we give all the money to this\nfarmer. So we told that story, we trusted everybody like we tr -- like we -- that we were.\nSo there were some Jewish partisan what -- what -- what always were stealing to make a\nliving all these years. They went to the farmer where we were hidden and they stole all\nthe money what they had, that we give them. Yeah.\nSE: He writes -- he does [indecipherable]\nCE: This time -- the son writes.\nSE: Yeah.\nCE: So th-this time it took about two months til we got money and it\u2019s a different --\nSE: We don\u2019t know.\nCE: -- this kind of the writing -- no, I got the feeling that she doesn\u2019t live either now.\nSE: This little boy was four years old when we were there hidden, so he suffered too,\nbecause is -- we were hidden there, so there was secret in the house and he wasn\u2019t\nallowed to tell anybody. So he deserves the money. So we know, even when she was dy -\n- dead, we -- we going to send it, because he deserves it. He deserves it, he had an hard --\nhard -- yo-youth because of that, that we were hidden there. So -- so we sent the money.\nWe -- Chaim doesn\u2019t get any money from Germany. He -- we did something wrong, wh-\nwhen we were in -- when we came to America, we had a lawyer in Holland -- in -- in --\nin Germany and he say -- and we couldn\u2019t get any money, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t get anything,\nyou don\u2019t get anything. You\u2019re not an invalid of -- you don\u2019t get anything.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cI can get one a month, 800 dollars.\u201d So, we had just ope -- bought the greeting card\nstore, so we took the 800 dollars and one in -- when you have just a business, it\u2019s like a\nbig pit, everything goes in the business. And after that, we never got any money. We had\nto sign that we will never ask for money again and Chaim doesn\u2019t get any money from\nGermany.\nSE: No, no.\ntoday we had some people from the concentration camp and it made so much big\nimpression on me.\u201d\u201d\u2019 She was so ex-ex-ex-excited about it, tells us the story. So I think,\nsome expresses more than the other, but I think 50 - 70 percent, 1t makes an impression.\nThey will remember always, they will tell always, if somebody denies the story, they will\nalways know to remember, when I was young, there was somebody what was there, he\ntold us our story. So we find it very rewarding for that reason alone. Is it one percent of\ntwo percent, that it leaves some impression on them. So I think that\u2019s the reason we go\nreally talking on school.\nha -- we have one soup kitchen in Branford and wh -- we have a lot of voluntun bring it\nwi -- to a man\u2019s shelter in New Haven. That do we three times a week. We do it Monday,\nWednesdays and Friday.\nSE: Yeah. I\u2019m very afraid. I\u2019m very afraid, every day. God forbid something happened.\nWhat will we do?\nWhite Supremacists -- is that the right word? White Supremacists. And all these things,\nyou think that 1s small, but they can -- not always, but it can grow to be something big, so\nyou have to be alert. If you see something like that, think that could grow. Not always\ndoes it, but you have to be alert. That\u2019s what I meant by the \u2018be alert.\u2019 So, you be aware\nof it, what\u2019s going on.\nSE: On the moment is here, in Guilford, is a movie on television, I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat it was, but I was yesterday to a Haddassah meeting and they said it was very anti-\nSemitic. They say something about the Jews and that it was not written, that what the\nstation say, we don\u2019t have the same opinion and the-they sa-say they going to call today,\nthe -- today\u2019s Monday?\nCE: [inaudible]\nSE: Yeah.\n-- we were one of the first -- were a -- there were a -- a dentist and a few, but they didn\u2019t -\n- they didn\u2019t know what Jews were here. Now, there live more Jewish people, not many,\nbut more Jewish people here and there\u2019s a synagogue and so -- no -- and there\u2019Il be more.\nBut here in -- if here was in --country club not far from here, was no Jews allowed 10\nyears ago or 15 years ago.\nSE: Well, before the v -- in 1910 - 1915, there were no Jews allowed to be -- work in\nbanks here in America and the Jews had a very, very hard time when you speak to people\nwhat lived here before the second World War.\nAnd if it gets bad time, you never know. People becomes -- becomes bad. They became\nbad, so --\nSE: -- happy na -- happy and healthy years na -- ahead of us.\nCE: Times like that, they\u2019Il never happen again, that\u2019s what we hope.\nSE: Yeah, that\u2019s what we hope, that times like that never will happen again. And we\nsuffer still under it and that\u2019s -- that that never will go away.\nCE: No.\nSE: No.\nCE: We miss it mostly with holidays when you come to get back together with family,\nwhat we don\u2019t.\nSE: We have no family.\nCE: And that is -- that 1s a big thing what we miss.\nSE: The children, yeah.\nCE: The chil -- miss.\nSE: Yes and it\u2019s very sad and -- and nobody understands that. All the people what we go\naround with, th-they don\u2019t understand, absolutely not. They cannot understand it, was\nthey never -- I mean they have families together, they will not -- comes not in the head of\nto ask us over, almost never. We don\u2019t want to go really, because we feel even more\nlonely when we go to another family and they have so much family and we sit there just\nthe two of us. So we not go. But that doesn\u2019t say, would be nice when they invite us. We\nhave some friends what invite us.\nCE: Yeah.\nSE: Yeah, we have some friends what invite us. We couldn\u2019t complain too much, so -- so\nlong we are healthy and together, that\u2019s the ma -- moment and I -- all the other things,\nforget it. And now I\u2019m going to make some soup.\nCE: All right, we finished? Okay.\nSE: Stand. No, also -- and you cannot tell it also not.\nCE: You can --\nSE: You cannot tell the story -- or how much you tell, you cannot tell the suffering.\nCE: It sounds different to us than to you. Than to the other what listens to. They can --\nSE: And I was thi-thinking when I was in the kitchen --\nCE: You have to be in this?\nSE: I was in the kitchen now and I thought, \u201c\u201cGee, I didn\u2019t tell them that the -- the -- the\ndoctors say we got to quiet you, throw you out on the street.\u201d They didn\u2019t even -- they\nlooked under the bed if there was blood that come off, they have to do something for me.\nI mean, they didn\u2019t even help me when I was in pr -- so in pain. I mean, there was nobody\nthere. I mean they -- and that not alone, it was always, you were so afraid, that every\nminute you could be dead, in camp. And that can you not tell -- something what --\nCE: What you mean nobody can understand it, that what it 1s.\nSE: No, and -- not alone --\nCE: You tell it.\nSE: You cannot tell it alls enough.\nCE: Take phone.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
