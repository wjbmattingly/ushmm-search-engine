And a buddy of\nApril 26, 2013\nmine I ran around with, my best friend, why he and I said well, it\u2019s time we tried to\nget in the service. I was crazy in those days, I was about 17 or something. So I tried\nto \u2014 tried to get in the Canadian roy \u2014 RCAF, the Canadian Air Force. And you had\nto move to Canada and live there for two years before they\u2019d take you. So we\ndidn\u2019t do that. So I just waited until a draft notice came, and went in the \u2014 went into\nbasic training that I di \u2014 didn\u2019t know where I was going. I got on a bus and they\ndrove me to Fresno, California, and that was a \u2014 a basic training.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 at Ardman(ph) aircraft, and going to school in the daytime. Anyway, I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t remember the exact date or anything like that, it\u2019s a long time ago. But went\nto basic training at Fresno, and after basic training I went to Sioux Falls, South\nDakota for radio school. Went from there to Salt Lake City for continued training,\nstuff like that, radio and communications and stuff like that. And then I was sent to\nDyersburg, Tennessee for training in B-17s as a radio operator, and top gunner on\nApril 26, 2013\nthe B-17. And after training there I had \u2014 I wanted to be a fighter pilot, so I applied\nfor fighter training, and nothing happened, so after \u2014 just about the time that we was\nready to ship overseas with \u2014 through basic training there at Dyersburg, Tennessee\nin B-17s, and dummy missions, you know, and navigation stuff like that. And flew\ndown over Cuba, and stuff, was just long range navigation training. Orders came\nthrough find us, report to Fort Worth, Texas for fighter school. I was already on a\ncrew, so I was \u2014 now I\u2019m gonna stay with the crew right there, and train with them\nfor months, and so we went to Germany. I went to fra \u2014 I went to England and\nthen re \u2014 Germany later. So, went to the 91*' bomb group in Bassingbourn,\nEngland, and that was shortly after the Memphis Belle completed its 25 missions,\nthe first plane to finish a \u2014 a group of missions, to go home, and then \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s ba \u2014 let\u2019s back up, just for a moment.",
        "A: Surely.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to training. What did you think of training? Did you enjoy it?\nWere there \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 difficult parts to it? What was the most challenging thing for you?",
        "A: I thought it was interesting. Was \u2014 we had a lo-lot of this \u2014 lots of \u2014 lots of\ntraining, learn communications and stuff. It\u2019s something new for a young guy, you\nApril 26, 2013\nknow, and was interesting to see the \u2014 how long the radio \u2014 how far you could reach\non the radios, where you could talk to Australians, and was up in altitude, cause we\nhad a training antenna that we could let out in the \u2014 in the radio room, you know.\nAnd I thought it was interesting, you know.",
        "Q: And did you like to be a radio operator, or di\u2014 how much say did you have in \u2014\nin the job that you ended up doing?",
        "A: I wa \u2014 always \u2014 I liked engines and stuff, and I wanted to be a \u2014 if I was going to\nbe a \u2014 in the sir \u2014 first, you know, to be an engine mechanic. So I thought I\u2019d do\nthat, but they gave you a-aptitude tests. And when I was in Fresno basic training,\nthey give you these tests, all sorts of stuff, mechanical and electrical and everything\nelse. And I was able to do real good in electrical and they needed electronic people\nthen, so they chose me to go to radio school, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, so that\u2019s\nwhere I went.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have any problem with that?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any problem. I liked th \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I liked to \u2014 I liked both,\nelectronics, and I became and electrical engineer later, and \u2014 and I always still fool\nwith en \u2014 engines, racing engine and stuff. It\u2019s a hobby, I\u2019m just inquisitive.",
        "Q: From the United States you go to England with the 91\u2018 bo-bomb group. What\npar \u2014 which air force was that? Was that Eighth Air Force?\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Eighth Air Force, first division, 91S\u2018 bomb group.",
        "Q: Rough \u2014 do you remember \u2014 recall when that was when you went over to\nEngland?",
        "A: It was \u2014 it must have been in June or July\u201944, near as I can recall.",
        "Q: How did you get over to England?",
        "A: Flew over.",
        "Q: You flew over?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: On wh-what sort of aircraft?",
        "A: I believe we left our plane in \u2014 in Bangor, Maine and we got on a \u2014 I believe it\nwas a military transport [indecipherable] C-47 possibly, very possibly, I don\u2019t\nreally recall. I know there was a bunch of people on it. There was about six nurses\nand a bunch of us guys on there \u2014 there. We landed in \u2014 in s \u2014 I think in \u2014 in Wales\nfirst, and then we took off from there and went \u2014 some people left, you know, we\nwent down to Bassingbourn.",
        "Q: And where \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, where did you say you ended up in England? Where\nwas your base, your first ba \u2014",
        "A: Bassingbourn. It\u2019s about 15 kilometers from ha \u2014 Cambridge.",
        "Q: What\u2019d you think of England?\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Oh, it was interesting, you know. A young person always \u2014 things are interesting\nto a young person. And the nice countryside, the \u2014 the \u2014 the base was a\u2014 was a\nRAF base, had been before, and then they carved out a lot of trees, they cut trees\ndown and we parked some of the planes in the a \u2014 the trees, for camouflage, I guess\nreally. And some of the buildings, we had Quonset huts, we had brick buildings, we\nhad different types of buildings, cause a lot of them were put in just to \u2014 you know,\nas new construction, because we moved in and taken over this whole milit \u2014 British\nbase. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did you interact with the British at all?",
        "A: Oh yeah. There was British people there. We\u2019d go to the little pubs and stuff like\nthat, and eat, you know, and no, it was good, and \u2014",
        "Q: How were you treated by them, by the English?",
        "A: Oh, very well. The girls would come to the base and walk around, they\u2019d talk\nwith us and stuff like that, you know, and carry on conversations and then they \u2014\nthey\u2019d go to town, the people \u2014 I only had one instance where I \u2014 I was on leave, go\n\u2014 go \u2014I was going to go to London, I was on the train over there \u2014 their trains have\na compartment on one side, and a aisle down the other side there, you na \u2014 a\ncompartment with about six people in them. And I was going to London one time\nand there was a little kid in there. I reached in my pocket and took out a Hershey\nApril 26, 2013\nchocolate bar, and gave this little kid. And the mother scolded me for tormenting\nthis little kid, because that\u2019s the only candy bar he had and he probably will ever\nhave, and I shouldn\u2019t have given it to him. And I thought I was doing him a favor.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Cause the little kids would \u2014 you\u2019d go up and down the street and the little kids\nwould see a American G.I., cause we always had, you know, spearmint chewing\ngum, or stuff like that, and they\u2019d say, got any gum, chum? And they\u2019d come out\nand grab you by the legs or something like that, say that, you know, and almost\nknock you down. And so, we just \u2014 you know, took candy and stuff for the little\nkids, and give it to them, you know, thought that was good. But that\u2019s the only time\nI ever had a run in with one that was \u2014 she just jumped all over me for giving her\nlittle kid that candy bar.",
        "Q: What did you think of London?",
        "A: Was kind of interesting city. I was there one time when \u2014 just after a V-1 hit\ndown by Hyde Park, and dug a big crater down there. And they had had these guys\nthat were like spit and argue club guys, or all these guys down there complaining\nabout the war and everything else, and you know, just carrying on talking and\nyakking, I don\u2019t know what they believed in or anything, but it was kind of\ninteresting to listen to him and \u2014 yakking and talking. And walk around Hyde Park\nApril 26, 2013\nand different place in London and I \u2014 interesting time. I \u2014 I thought I was \u2014 lost my\narm there one time. I went in \u2014 I got a hotel in \u2014 with one of the other guys I was\nwith, and we \u2014 I was laying in this bed, and it had a bar on the side of it and I\nsomehow li \u2014 laid my arm down at the side and that bar was right under my arm,\nand it cut off my circulation so my arm was \u2014 went to sleep, and I woke up in the\nmorning and tried to move the arm, and it wasn\u2019t there, and I reached over trying to\nfind for it, it was hanging outside the bed, you know, that was kind of interesting.\nThen mis \u2014 the people, I had no trouble with the people, I think was pleasant.",
        "Q: Did you make any English friends or girlfriends?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. No, didn\u2019t have time.",
        "Q: How much training did you do in England be-before \u2014",
        "A: Well, quite a bit of training, because in \u2014 1n the radio thing, the Americans had\nfive letter code groups, they\u2019d send groups of five letters, and then you had to\ndecode \u2014 decipher that into real language, from the SOI standard operating\nprocedures, and the British had four letter groups. So the navigator and myself went\nto another base in England and trained \u2014 cross trained with the British, receiving\ntheir codes and stuff like that, and their diver \u2014 procedures that they had. So we\nApril 26, 2013\nwent about th \u2014 I think it was a couple weeks of training, cross training with the\nBritish, then went back to base, cause \u2014 cause we were in a lot \u2014 with the British a\nlot, you know, naturally, we was in their country still.",
        "Q: What sort of aircraft did you have, and where were you 1n that aircraft?",
        "A: I was the radio operator by the center of the aircraft, just behind the bomb bays,\nand I had gun above the head. And it was a B-17G, we just got the Gs model in\nwhen I was there. And I always used to go down the lines and see a lot of planes\nthat come back were pretty shot up, and we wondered how they flew, and part of\ntheir tails missing and everything else, and big holes in them, you know. And it was\nkind of interesting to see them, you know, cause I was inquisitive.",
        "Q: Was it frightening?",
        "A: I never really seemed to get too excited about that. I always thought \u2014 I always\nfigured that if the plane went down, my idea was I\u2019d \u2014 I'd go down with it, and it\u2019d\ncrash and I\u2019d get out of the crash somehow. But my mind changed when I got shot\ndown.",
        "Q: First combat experience \u2014 first flew \u2014 no \u2014 not \u2014 what \u2014 your first flight that you\nwent over the Channel, what \u2014 when was that, what was that like?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact day that we had there. I think there was training\nflights that we went just to the coast, turn around, come back, three of them. And\nApril 26, 2013\nthen on the day of the \u2014 the bomb, when I fir \u2014 when I was shot down, why we got\nup quite early in the morning, about four o\u2019clock or something like that, I don\u2019t\nremember the exact time. It was early. Had the briefing and then we took off and we\nused to climb at certain altitudes [indecipherable] because you have a lot of\nairplanes up there. So they have a colored flares, and you have a \u2014 each plane has a\ndifferent colored flare and they fire it off up there at altitude and then you\nrendezvous onto that group. That\u2019s your definition, and you start from there on your\nmission. So, you climb to a pretty good altitude before you start to cross the\nChannel. And it was interesting to, before that, that the V-1s that they were firing\non England, they were these kind of a putt, you hear them flapping, cause they had\na \u2014a pulse jet motor on them, and you\u2019d hear those at night. And as long as they\nweren\u2019t coming right over your head. Why? Because they didn\u2019t steer them, they\njust had an angle, wherever they go, and then they would kick the rudder over and \u2014\nthe horizontal stabilizers rather, and they just dive straight down. The British\ndeveloped a technique to keep those from coming into England. They had a fighter\n\u2014 real big fighters called nape \u2014 Typhoon, with a Napier Sabre big engine on it.\nWasn\u2019t \u2014 I guess it was too heavy to be a real good fighter like the Spitfire. And\nthey would send those out over the Channel when they hear \u2014 see these things\ncoming in, cause they flew at a certain altitude, and the Typhoons would fly along\nApril 26, 2013\nthe side of them and flap the wing on them and tip the gyro in, and they just spiral\ninto the ocean. So the British really did a good job on downing many, many\nhundreds of those darn B-I1s.",
        "Q: It had to take some pretty skilled flying to do that.",
        "A: Yeah, well they just fly alongside. They were doing about maybe, I don\u2019t know,\n300 miles an hour, 250 mile an hour, fly alongside and just flap the wing, you\nknow, tip it a little bit. The \u2014 the \u2014 tip the gyro in the rocket and they just spiral into\nthe ocean. It was a clever idea, you know, and didn\u2019t take \u2014 they didn\u2019t fire on them\nbecause if they shot them, and then they explode and you'd fly right through all that\ndebris.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was a clever idea. Didn\u2019t take much you know, and the air \u2014 Typhoons\ncould catch them real easy. So I thought that was real clever, myself.",
        "Q: When was the first time you, after your training, and after you did the coastal\nruns and what have you, that you crossed over the Channel and went on a combat\nmission?",
        "A: Th-The \u2014 what day, you mean?",
        "Q: No, not necessarily day, but what was that experience like? Do you remember\ntha \u2014 going over for the first time?\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, I remember going over and seeing the \u2014 the coastline and \u2014 and seeing\nsome other planes where ya \u2014 I think we took \u2014 some planes took wa \u2014 one hit \u2014 I\nremember over Calais, France, I think it was, one took a \u2014 took a direct hit in the\nbomb bay, it looked like, cause it just blew up, disappeared, you know. And then we\nwent on to our target, 1t was a dru \u2014 it was an underground airbase, fighter base, and\nthey had caves and stuff in these hills where they\u2019d put the fires inside, and\neverything was camouflaged, so it was a hard thing to find, but they were trying to\nknock out as much of those fighters as they could because of the invasion forces,\nyou know. So we made a \u2014 went out and found the initial point, which is an\nidentifiable point that you \u2014 they can find to turn on, and they drove cer \u2014 certain\naltitudes, certain speed and in a certain direction, and to the target. We met the first\ntime and that \u2014 the bombardier couldn\u2019t find the target, camouflaged. So you do a\nno-no, we \u2014 we made a 360 degree turn and went back to same initial point and\nstarted the same course, same altitude, same everything. By that time the barrage\nflak that you see all the time hadn't got us the first time, so they had their tracking\nflak on us in. They knew our altitude, our course, they knew where we were going.\nSo the tail gunner says, about 300 yards off the tail, had a burst. Next one through\nthe waist, and the left wing wen-went off, and we caught on fire and started into a\nspiral. And I always figured I\u2019d ride the airplane down, get out of the crash or\nApril 26, 2013\nsomething. But you change your mind rather quickly when that happens, so I \u2014 guys\njust bailing out, you know, when they gave the order to bail out. And I started out of\nthe radio room and heard the ball turret gunner was spinning around, so I figure the\ncommunications were shot out or something, so I grabbed a big tuner, you know,\nthe transmitter in the radio room and started beating on top of it. And he pointed the\nguns down and the handles come up and I flipped it out and he pops out. He was a\nlittle guy, and he popped out of there so quick I couldn\u2019t believe it. Hand him his\nparachute, he sta \u2014 snapped it on and boy he was out the win \u2014 out the door. I was\nright behind him.",
        "Q: What altitude were you at when you bailed, roughly?",
        "A: What \u2014 what else did I take?",
        "Q: What al-altitude were you at when you bailed?",
        "A: Was about \u2014 I think about 27,000 - 27 five \u2014",
        "Q: So you were up.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You were up.",
        "A: We were about \u2014 about 30,000 we started.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we were in a dive, sort of a spiral dive, you know.\nApril 26, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: What was that experience like, bailing out?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have too much, I guess the excitement, and all that stuff, that you don\u2019t\nthink about it, I was just trying to get out of that fiery airplane. And so we\u2019d always\nbeen told to delay your jump, cause they may \u2014 may shoot you coming down in the\nparachute, you know, a fighter come by, or something like that. So I had delayed\nmy parachute til I could kind of see the leaves on the trees. And I popped the chute\nand it seemed like I took a couple swings and I was on the ground. And then there\nwas a\u2014a little boy, a lady, and a \u2014 at the end of this field where I landed in, there\nwas a little boy over there and a lady, and so I \u2014 he ran over towards me and I\nreached in my kneepads to get my escape kit out and there\u2019s a little \u2014 we have\nbooks in there, a little book that says English and French, you know, cause we\n[indecipherable] France, and maps and stuff. And he pointed the [indecipherable]\nin the book, and he says hide, in there. So they took off. So I stuck my parachute\nunder some bushes there at the edge of the field, and ran through the forest and got\nto the other side and I didn\u2019t know going to the other side is that I was getting\ndeeper in the forest, but I come to a clearing. Now that little boy don\u2019t want to go\nout in there, cause gonna see me. So I just heard these \u2014 all these Germans running,\nApril 26, 2013\nyou could hear them, and there\u2019s \u2014 their canister they carry with them is \u2014 their gas\nmask rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some\nbushes right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and\nhear when the Germans come up, he\u2019s \u2014 I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he\nwas so close, but he was looking way out ahead, he wasn\u2019t looking down at his feet.\nAnd I don\u2019t know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, 1t was probably an hour or\nsomething like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn\u2019t breathe for a couple\nhours, I don\u2019t think. But anyhow, they finally went away and then I just walked\nthrough the forest and \u2014 and I got my maps and there \u2014 they had maps that they\ngave you were like a silk handkerchief, but their maps were detailed, they had the\ncurves in the road, you could see paths in the forest, and they had \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhere I got them, but they were very good. So I saw a curve in the road and it\u2019s\nwhere I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one road, a\ndivided highway. And then I heard a big racket coming, I was right in the middle of\nit, it was quite wide, their divided highway was, and there\u2019s grass and s \u2014 lot of trees\ngrowing in the middle of it. And around the corner I get \u2014 hear them coming. So I\ndove into the grass and hear a bunch of German tanks and everything else was\ncoming by, and guys in, I don\u2019t know, looked like armored cars or something, I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t able to really look, I was \u2014 buried myself in the grass, hoping they\nApril 26, 2013\ndidn\u2019t see me. And they went on by, didn\u2019t see me, so I thought[indecipherable]\nget out of here, so I headed back. And every time I seen one walking, I would just\nveer off at an angle. I wouldn\u2019t walk close to them, cause they\u2019d see me, identify\nme. So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. I never made any\nsharp turns or quick turns or anything like that, and finally I came to this forest area,\nand I ran across an old deserted \u2014 I don\u2019t know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but\nit was pretty dilapidated. So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all\nwet and stuff like that. So I took off my coveralls, cause I had coveralls with\nsuspenders and stuff, my flight suit. So hung up on the thing in the top of it there,\nand laid down on the straw, and went to bed. And then the next morning, early the\nnext morning, I don\u2019t know, seven \u2014 six, seven o\u2019clock, or what time it was, but I\nheard crack \u2014 like sticks breaking, and stuff like that, and I peek out. Here is a guy\nout there, I thought he was an old man, it looks pre \u2014 he was probably 40 years old,\ncause I was only 19. And so I didn\u2019t know what to do, I had my .45 automatic, pil \u2014\nyou know, shoulder holster and sa \u2014 I says, I don\u2019t know whether to shoot at the\nguy, or make a noise in the \u2014 I had to make a decision real quick here. So I thought\nno, I stuck the gun in the straw, and I stepped out to the door, pulled the \u2014 and\npeeked out to him. And he put his finger up to his mouth like be quiet. And he says\n[indecipherable]. I didn\u2019t know French, but I thought that meant friend or\nApril 26, 2013\nsomething. So he says, shh. So he left. And so about 10 - 15 minutes later, here he\ncome back. Started motioning me to come with him. So I reluctantly went with him.",
        "Q: Did you take your weapon with you or leave it in the straw?",
        "A: No, I left it in the straw.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to be caught with it because I\u2019d always been told, if you wi \u2014 get\nwith the French underground \u2014 and I| didn\u2019t know who itt was, they didn\u2019t know me\neither, why, if you don\u2019t do exactly what they say, they\u2019Il shoot you. You know,\nbecause they don\u2019t know who you are either. Maybe an infiltrator. So I figure it\u2019s\nbest just to not take the chance, I\u2019Il just leave the gun there. So I left it in the straw\nand went with him, and we walked through the forest quite a ways, maybe a mile it\nseemed like. And came to a house and went to the back hou \u2014 of the house, it was a\nfence \u2014 brick, like brick fence, but half of it was torn down so that when we stepped\nover that, went into the house. And the family \u2014 I took my concentrated\n[indecipherable] my escape kit, and gave it to them. And they made me hot\nchocolate and brought it to me and breakfast in the morning. I stayed there about\nthree days. One time the German came to look \u2014 I \u2014 I guess just watch \u2014 looking for\npeople, and they hid me out in the pigpen out 1n the back. And then they brought me\nback in, I stayed there. And then they brought a \u2014 a couple of \u2014 a guy who had a\nApril 26, 2013\nbicycle and another bicycle for me, and he took me out \u2014 he ga \u2014 he gave me fresh\nclothes to put on. I had a tam, and stuff like that.",
        "Q: How long were you with that family before you got \u2014",
        "A: Three days.",
        "Q: Three days, okay.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know their names?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember their names. I wish I did, but I don\u2019t remember their\nnames. They had a \u2014 a young lady there, their daughter I guess it was, that used to\nbring the warm cereal and kind of coffee and \u2014 kind of an ersatz type coffee, I don\u2019t\nknow, it was of str \u2014 strange ta \u2014",
        "Q: Chicory?",
        "A: Yeah, like that. And that was \u2014 I was treated real well there and they \u2014 like I had\na nice bed, and stuff like that. And then, you know, I rode away with this guy, he\ntook me to another house, and that was Madam Marie Duvall(ph). I remember her\nname. And there I met a \u2014 well, a pilot, Jim Fore(ph).",
        "Q: Really?\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, he was there. And so, I was really surprised to see him, you know, but I\nguess they were all in the underground group there, you know, and we all lit in a\ncertain area there. Anyway, here I met him, and \u2014",
        "Q: I don\u2019t suppose you had occasion at that point to question his circling around and\ndoing that bomb run again?",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no. No, you \u2014 you know, they said they were \u2014 and th \u2014 and said,\nwe gotta take out these \u2014 these fighter bases and stuff like that. Cause they told us in\nbriefing, you know, gotta get it done. So, you \u2014 you do what you\u2019re assigned to do.\nSo if you made the decision, make a 360, why, he knew more about it and what \u2014\nwhat was going on than I did, he and the bombardier, so you know, I \u2014",
        "Q: Did he recognize you straight away when he saw you?",
        "A: Oh, oh yeah, sure. We gave each other a hug, you know. And we stayed there a\nfew days and the lady, Madame Marie Duvall(ph) had a \u2014 there\u2019s a basement, and\nthey had a radio in the basement, and we could listen to BBC. So we got there, we \u2014\nI stayed there, I don\u2019t know, three or four days maybe, I don\u2019t know wa \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t\nremember exactly how many, but then a guy in a two wheel cart, a horse drawn two\nwheel cart came by, and we got in this cart with him, and we rode through a ho \u2014\nlittle \u2014 down a road and then turn a corner, went to a little village, and there was\nGerman tanks there, and soldiers, everything else, and here we were sitting there in\nApril 26, 2013\nGerman \u2014 in French tams and stuff, in civilian clothes, and shaking like a leaf here,\nprobably. But we were just trying to act nonchalant, you know, riding with this guy,\ncause if they\u2019d [indecipherable] he\u2019d have been shot right away too, you know.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: So, we tried to be as calm as possible, and anyway, he took us to this house, li-\nlike a sa \u2014 let\u2019s see, we were at Madame Marie Duvall\u2019s(ph) house, and then we\nwent from there to a \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, a man and a lady had a house and they lived\nin there, and there the \u2014 we were supposed to be picked up by someone and taken\nsouth of Paris cause they\u2019d supposedly made arrangements to come in with an A-\n20 and pick us up south of Paris. They\u2019re going to light up a field out there, a hay\nfield or something. And a plane was supposed to come in and pick us up. So they\ntook us to another house, we stayed there a few days, and they \u2014 they had nothing\nbut wine to drink. And I got so thirsty for some water, we went out to the \u2014 where\nthey had a well outside there, and started pulling up the water from the well, and the\nFrench guy come out and said, no, no, no, he said \u2014 I guess he thought it was poison\nor something or not with \u2014 fit to drink, you know. But man, I \u2014 if you\u2019d been\ndrinking just their white wine for a f-few days why your \u2014 get \u2014 get so thirsty for\nreal water, you know? I did, anyway. And so anyways, a guy came by, and you\nprobably heard the name Jacques before. He was a \u2014 I wa \u2014I found out \u2014 we found\nApril 26, 2013\nout later he was a traitor, he was a Belgian F-French guy, and he was getting paid so\nmuch a head for all the people he turned in to the ga \u2014 the Germans. And so we got\nin this car, this Citro\u00e9n \u2014 oh, in the meantime, and \u2014 this house we were at, they\nbrought another kid there, he was a \u2014 from a Wellington bomber, a British kid from\na Wellington bomber. So it was Jim Fore(ph), myself and this guy from the\nWellington bomber. And so they \u2014 we got in the back of this Citro\u00e9n, and the \u2014 the\nguy had a hat too big for him, kind of bug eyed little guy, and \u2014 and he had a\nredheaded woman with him, and a kid maybe 10 - 12 years old in the front seat with\nhim. We drove into Versailles, dropped the girl \u2014 lady off and the little boy off in\nVersailles, and we wer \u2014 thought it was kind of strange, we went through some\nroadblocks just right on through, you slowed down and right on through. We\nthought boy, that\u2019s sort of strange. They told us it wa \u2014 he was a doctor, he could\nget through, you know, real easy cause he had the, I guess I.D. or something. But\nwe were kind of shaken. Anyway, we went \u2014 then he left them there, we went into\nParis. We ended up getting driven right into Gestapo headquarters. So, kind of\nsurprised. So they \u2014 we went \u2014 they had the machine guns all around, and then we\nseparated so \u2014 we walked up these stairs, second floor and down the hall, and the\nother Germans there, they\u2019re standing against the hall like they were afraid of us.\nThey\u2019d stand way back [indecipherable] walking down the hall. And they\nApril 26, 2013\nseparated Jim and I and I don\u2019t know where the prin \u2014 the British kid go \u2014 went\neither, but I know Jim and I were on the same floor up there, but he was 1n another\nroom. And I went into this room, there was a lady and a German guy there, and he\nspoke English, and she was taking \u2014 writing all this stuff down. And so they started,\nyou know, searching us and stuff like that. And I had my wristwatch and \u2014 and \u2014 up\naround my arm, up here. But they took my dog tags, I had them in my shoes and\nthey took everything, just took everything off of us, you know, and \u2014 and put it ina\nsi\u2014 in a\u2014a ba\u2014a bag there, in a big envelope. And I said, can I write my name on\nit or something like that? And he says no need, bury you in two days. But they\ndidn\u2019t put my name on it. And th-the watch I had was not my military watch, it was\nissue watch, but \u2014 cause I had given that to the navigator cause that day he said his\nwatch didn\u2019t work, and so I had mine and I had a gold watch that my mother had\ngiven me for graduating from school, so I wore it. But I had slipped it up here\naround my elbow. Anyway, took everything. So, from then on, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nthey just took us back and finally after that they took us to French prison. You ever\nheard of that? South of Paris? Which \u2014",
        "Q: Did they interrogate you there at Gestapo headquarters?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And what was that process like?\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: No, no \u2014 it was \u2014 1t was not \u2014 not too bad. They ask us questions, they would be\nkind of firm about it, and he had a revolver laying right beside him on his desk. I\nguess that was kind of to be a threat to us or something like that. But I don\u2019t know, I\ndidn\u2019t pay much attention to it, all I gave him was name, rank and serial number.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t til I got over to Fr-French prison, I think it was, that we were \u2014 the\nother interrogation took place that this German officer \u2014 I went into the officer and\nhe shoved this paper out in front of me to sign. And I just shoved it back and I said\nno, I shook my head no. He said no, no, no and started to holler and come out from\nbehind the desk, started kicking at me, and a couple of guards outside the door there\ngrabbed me and put \u2014 I was put in a \u2014 a little box, it was about maybe two or three\nfeet square, metal box, for about 24 hours. And then, the next day, why they took\nme out in the courtyard of \u2014 and lined me up 1n front of the firing squad. They had\nabout five guys there, four or five guys with rifles and za \u2014 the German officers,\ncouple of them there, and they were hollering at me and asking me questions and\nstuff. And I thought I was already dead, so I just, again, I gave them my main \u2014\nname, rank and serial number, and I just stood there and looked at them. Cause I\nthought I was already dead, you know, I just crossed the bridge there for some\nreason and I just \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know why it come over me, I was just totally calm,\nI thought sh \u2014 I\u2019m dead, go ahead and shoot me, you know, didn\u2019t make any\nApril 26, 2013\ndifference. And they just stormed around there for a while, stomping their feet and\nhollering. They had a guy with a British accent, was asking questions. And they\nwanted to know squadron, and all that good stuff. They had all that data, I found out\nlater. But, anyway, they finally gave up and put me back in a cell, and I went ina\ncell for 38 days in solitary, and \u2014",
        "Q: Thir \u2014 how many days?",
        "A: Thirty-eight.",
        "Q: What was on the paper he wanted you to sign?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t read it, it was in German. So I \u2014 I was always told, you\nknow, they\u2019ll give you papers, try to sign something, everything else. They\u2019ll even\nhave a Red Cross on it, to think sir \u2014 from the Red Cross or something. We were\ntold that by intelligence people, you know, that they had this \u2014 all these things\ngoing, so I just \u2014 but me, I wasn\u2019t going to sign anything. You could have signed\nyour death warrant, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing, you know, or confessions\nor something like that. So I just didn\u2019t sign it, and dil \u2014 I gotta say, he got a little\nupset over that, but \u2014 and put me in solitary and then they would come in \u2014 th-the\nold prison, I don\u2019t know if you know about French prison, they have the ol-old type\ndoors. The doors are about three inches thick, I think, wooden doors, you know, and\nthey had this little trap door up the top, over door that they could open and slide a\nApril 26, 2013\nbowl of soup in to you. And tha \u2014 and that, they had a little peephole, and they had a\n\u2014 one light on the side of this, in the room there, that they could turn on a switch on\nthe outside and light the light, and in the corner you had a little carved out place\nthere in cement, that had a little water spigot, and that was the toilet also there. And\nhad straw on \u2014 on the fl \u2014 you know, a little place for you to sleep. Anyway, I \u2014\nthey\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d come by and flip that light on and that little \u2014 you could hear them\npeeking \u2014 that little thing and peeking at you, you know, every once in a while. So I\ndecided that I didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I took my little soup bowl\nI had, they put in there, and I propped it up on this little shelf in there so it covered\ntheir peek hole. Shouldn\u2019t have done that. Anyway, come along, pe \u2014 turned on the\nlight, I guess, and couldn\u2019t see in. And boy, I heard the awful-est racket you ever\nheard out there. There\u2019s guys running, and you could hear their canisters clanging,\ntheir gas masks things and everything. Pretty soon they opened the door, about two\nor three of them are there, and they come in and started knocking me all around the\nroom, and \u2014 trying to teach me a lesson, you know. And then they left. And I was \u2014\nand I spent my time picking fleas, because they had lice, or fleas in there, and the\nfleas would get in the seams of your clothes, you know, and as a good pastime,\ncause they\u2019d bite you all over, and I was taking \u2014 you could feel along, little hard\nthings and you\u2019d crunch them, you\u2019d break their shells, you know. So that was our\nApril 26, 2013\npastime. And then we\u2019d tap on the wall, cause there were other prisoners there. And\nthere were some points you could tap and you could read the Morse code there. So\nyou knew there were other American prisoners there or something, you know, cause\nthey\u2019d tap back, you know. So just spent your pastime that way. Once I was \u2014",
        "Q: What did you talk about?",
        "A: Just a \u2014 trying to ask questions. They heard something like they were bombing at\nnight, and you\u2019d hear people screaming, women and men and you heard noises all\nnight long, you hear sh \u2014 gunshots, you don\u2019t know what was going on. And I heard\nlater they were probably torturing people out there, you know, the ai \u2014 they \u2014 cause\nthey had a lot of the French underground people they\u2019d caught also. And once I was\ntaken out to a little courtyard, you had a wa \u2014 a kind of a balcony thing up there,\nwhere the guard kept walking back and forth. And then they had this little area\nthere, and you walk around some, I guess that was your exercise room, you know. It\nwas \u2014 it was penned in, but it was about probably 20 feet square, you could just\nwalk around this little path around the square for exercise. And you could see\ncarvings on the wall where people had been there from the 1800s or something like\nthat. It\u2019s an old, old prison, but all the limestone walls, people scratched their names\nand stuff in it, you know, it was kind of intriguing to see all the people that had\nprobably been there before. Cause it\u2019s an old, old prison, so \u2014 for France. And\nApril 26, 2013\nanyway, finally, when you got, I guess as \u2014 Americans were about, I don\u2019t know,\nwho knows, 12 - 15 miles away, maybe ma \u2014 further, but there was shelling going\non, you could hear it all night long, the cannons and stuff. And then it started\ngetting pretty noisy. And so, all of a sudden the \u2014 they evacuated us, took us out,\ntook us all and put us in those boxcars. And they putting 90 of us in one of those\nboxcars, and we had to stand up. And they put a barrel in the center, cut off half a\nbarrel and that was a toilet and everything, you know, sloshing around there. And so\nthey \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we were going, you know, we thought we were going\nto be taken out of there to a POW camp, or something, you know, but we ended up\ngoing so far and then we came to a tunnel. And apparently the Americans or\nsomeone [indecipherable] someone had bombed the tunnel shut. And so we were\nin there for quite a few hours, and it got smoky and really bad. And so \u2014 then they\ntook us all \u2014 all these boxcars and made us take the German, I don\u2019t know,\nbackpacks and boxes and things that we carry clothing. And we walk \u2014 followed\nthem down a road and then across a bridge to the other side of this river, up the\nother side, and then we went through a little village and the \u2014 the French people\nwere out there throwing us apples and some food and stuff like that. And the\nGermans were trying to keep them from it, but they\u2019d still throw the stuff, you\nknow, and we\u2019d catch something. And then we got to a train on the other side where\nApril 26, 2013\nthe tunnel had \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 you know, where the tunnel had been closed, we \u2014\nthey had backed a train up at the other side. We boarded that train and went onto \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, but I guess we got to Frankfurt, I think,\nGermany. But before we got there, was going up a hill or something, it\u2019s kind of\nslow, and the tru \u2014 the boxcar right behind us, the \u2014 th-the guys had pried a board\nout of the bottom of the \u2014 I found out later, pried \u2014 and the guys were dropping out\nbetween the railroad tracks. And then, when the train was going up a hill, slowing\ndown, why they\u2019d drop between the tracks and roll out between the wheels to get\nout from under there, because they had these scrapers that would go between it. So\na few of the guys got out. I heard later on \u2014 I don\u2019t know this to be a fact, but I\nheard later on that one guy from Texas, he really escaped. He\u2019s the only guy I ever\nheard of ac-actually got away. So \u2014 but kind of a dangerous thing to do, but you\nknow, was trying to get out of there, and then the \u2014 the one time they \u2014 they \u2014a\nFrench kid in our box car was hanging on one of the vents. On the opposite \u2014\ncattywampus corners of the boxcar they had a vent about maybe eight or 10 inches\nhigh and about two feet long for a vent. They had barbed wire strung across it. And\nthere was this French kid, he\u2019s about 18 years old, I guess, or so \u2014 fif\u2014 14 - 15, I\ndon\u2019t know how old he was. And he had his hand up on this barbed wire, holding\nonto it, cause we were standing up in there. And the German guards on the outside\nApril 26, 2013\nshot him right through the hand. And that\u2019s kind of crazy, you know, he\u2019s already in\nthere. And anyway, then they stopped the car, they took him out. And \u2014 oh, before\nthat, by the way, when these guys dropped out between the railroad tracks, they\nstopped the train, and they took about, I don\u2019t know, it must have been 10 or 15\nguys out there beside the boxcar, lined them up like they were going to shoot them\n\u2014 cause we could look out through the cracks and see them, and they looked like\nthey were going to shoot them, and then this German officer was hollering at them\nand stuff like that. And then we were told that there \u2014 every time \u2014 if anyone tried to\nescape they were going to kill 15 guys for every one that tried to escape. So they\nwere trying to quiet us down, I guess. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. And they took this\nyoung kid out, I was surprised. And I was looking out a crack in that boxcar. The\nGerman officer told him to \u2014 kind of motioned him down there. The tracks were\nraised, kind of sloped on the side, down to \u2014 there\u2019s a f\u2014 some fields down there,\nhave been plowed and stuff. And there\u2019s a little irrigation ditch along the edge of tt.\nI looked down and I thought well, this German officer motioned this kid down\nthere, I thought that he was going to have him go down, wash his hand off, cause it\nwas bleeding and stuff like that. But as soon as he turned around, this German\nofficer shot him right through the back. And the kid laid down and kind of kicked\nlike, and one of the other guards there just raked him with a machine gun. And \u2014\nApril 26, 2013\nand then they took a couple of guys out of the boxcar and gave them shovels and\nmade them go down there by the \u2014 right down close to that little ditch down there,\nand they \u2014 they weren\u2019t there very long. They dug a hole, and I don\u2019t think the thing\nwas two feet deep. Threw this little kid in there and covered him up. And I thought,\nthe mother will never know where that kid is. Cause who knows today \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 what happened to him, you know? Cause I thought boy, how cruel can you be?\nHe\u2019s already in a prison, you know, in the ca \u2014 there, and why\u2019d they shoot him in\nthe hand in the first place? It\u2019s just do \u2014 I think 1t showed \u2014 to try to warn us, don\u2019t\ntry anything. That\u2019s what I assumed, you know? And anyway, we went on and we\nwere kind of shocked, I was anyway. I think all of us were that \u2014 we pulled up in \u2014\non this railroad place in front of this fence, got out. All these stripy clothes prisoners\nin there, and dogs and they herd us into this camp, and it was Buchenwald\nconcentration camp.",
        "Q: When you arrived, where did you think you had arrived?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know at first, I didn\u2019t even know about the camp, and I thought we were\ngoing to a POW camp. This was my assumption, you know, cause we\u2019d always told\nthey\u2019d take you to Dulag Luft or something, and interrogate you and then take you\nto prisoner of war camp. But we were kind of shocked when we arrived there, cause\nApril 26, 2013\nwe saw, you know, that sign out there on the gate says, wor-wor-work will make\nyou free, in German, and saw the \u2014 all the dogs, and these German guards and\nthere\u2019s skinny prisoners in there, you know, and \u2014 and all the striped clothes. And\nsince we got in there some of the prisoners come up and pretty soon they started\ntelling \u2014 and in English, a few of them spoke English, and \u2014 or it was relayed\nthrough some of the guys that \u2014 we had one guy in our group that spoke \u2014 Ben\nSharf(ph) was a ger \u2014 spoke German real well. And so he said, we\u2019re in\nBuchenwald concentration camp. And then they took us in and stripped all of our\nclothes off of us and put us in a shower-like thing, you know, and we come out, we\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. And then they shaved every hair off of our body\nand then swabbed us with something like creosote that set us on fire, you know, and\nyou ben \u2014 you was dancing around, jumping and si \u2014 cause it was burning, Ju-just\nlike it\u2019s peeling the skin off, you know. And then they brought us down a little fu-\nfurther and they started handing us some clothing. I was given a woman\u2019s silk\nblouse, and a pair of like silk slacks, or women\u2019s slacks or something, real thin\nthings, no shoes, no socks, no nothing. They took everything we had away, our\nother clothes, before we went in the shower. We went in the shower, we thought we\nwere going to the gas chamber or something, you know, cause we\u2019d heard stories\nabout that stuff. But anyway, we were shocked, sort of, that \u2014 and they just finally\nApril 26, 2013\nherd us down to an area and left us there, we were outside on a rock pile. And I\ndon\u2019t know, we were there I don\u2019t know how many days. But at night it was getting\ncold, so we\u2019d all hover around, and cuddle up together, you know, to try to stay\nwari, and \u2014",
        "Q: You were out of doors during the nights?",
        "A: Yeah, out-outside, and a \u2014 kind of a rock pile area there. And then we \u2014 one day\nwe saw \u2014 we heard this noise, we look up 1n the air and hear a \u2014 about 30,000 feet\nor so up there was a whole bunch of bombers coming over, you know, you could\nsee the contrails behind them. And they were \u2014 looked like they were coming right\nat us. We said, holy mackerel, you know, I hope they\u2019re not going to drop those\nthings on us. And all of a sudden they popped a flair, like a lead bombardier always\npops a flair and they s \u2014 the group tightens their formation, and they make a nice\npattern. So we thought, holy mackerel, here they come. And all of a sudden you\nheard this ru \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 if you ever heard bombs coming down, they fi \u2014 sound like a\nfreight train coming down the track, and there\u2019s a little whistle going on to them,\nand they\u2019re just shredder and rattling like a freight train coming in, you know. And\nall of a sudden \u2014 and they started landing below, and we thought, boy, they\u2019re going\nto get us here. But not one bomb lit inside the \u2014 the fence. They blew part of the \u2014\nthe fence down, but they were bombing the underground factory that \u2014 where all the\nApril 26, 2013\nwor \u2014 the slave labor was used. And that was a V-2, V-2, gyros and factories for\nammunition and stuff like that there. So we were relieved and \u2014 you know, they\ndidn\u2019t drop it on us. But they \u2014 apparently they went down the SS barracks, took out\nabout 2,000 SS guys and \u2014 and gutted the whole place with \u2014 they first went in with\nexplosives and then they dropped incendiaries after that. Then they dropped leaflets.\nI saw one of the leaflets, but they started shooting at people that picked up the\nleaflets, so there were \u2014 but there were still a few prisoners got ahold of leaflets. I\nsaw one of them later. It showed a picture of a B-17 and a silhouette of a B-29,\nshowed how much bigger the B-29 was and that we warned the Germans that they\nwere going to start using these planes on them if they don\u2019t surrender, and stuff like\nthat, you know, and \u2014 and it showed how Americans treat German prisoners of war,\nand stuff, 1t showed them in mess halls and stuff like that. And they \u2014 and then had\na thing and they were trying to invite the pr \u2014 us prisoners to join them and fight\nagainst the Russians. And they give us extra benefits or something. You know, this\nkind of crazy thing.",
        "Q: Were you made to work?",
        "A: They tried to \u2014 they come up and ask us what our profession was, what we could\ndo and stuff like that, and all of said we were students. We already had agreed to\nthis before, we were going to say they were all students. And so we \u2014 we held by\nApril 26, 2013\nthat, and they \u2014 it made them pretty mad that we didn\u2019t tell them we had any\nprofessions other than just students and fliers. So we \u2014 none of us worked, we all\nrefused to work. So \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that was a good idea or not, but we weren\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t seem be punished any more for it, you know. And they finally \u2014 we were\nliving outside, like I say, on the rocks out there. And one day \u2014 and there were a lot\nof these little Gypsy kids, you\u2019ve heard about them probably. I don\u2019t know how\nmany, there were hundreds of them around there. And you had to watch, because if\nyou had any food left at all, you have some, once in a while, about once a week, you\nget about three little \u2014 real small, little baked potatoes, half rotten, but they\u2019d been\nboiled, you know. It was better than nothing. And if one of \u2014 if you had piece of\nthose left, they\u2019d steal it, those poor little Gypsy kids that were running around, they\nwere hungry, you know, and they steal anything that wasn\u2019t tied down. And they\nwere in a barracks there, and one day, it seemed like to me, they all disappeared.\nAnd they come down and got us and gave us that barracks. And I used to think, oh\nmy, what\u2019d they do, did they kill them all? They [indecipherable] their camp, what\nhappened to them? I still to this day don\u2019t know really what all happened to those\npoor little kids. But they were little \u2014 you know, from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,\nall the eastern countries that they picked them up, their parents were probably\nkilled, and they brought them in there. But that was \u2014 that\u2019s been kind of a\nApril 26, 2013\ndisturbing thing all my life, the \u2014 what happened to those poor little kids, you know.\nBut we wer \u2014 we got the barracks and \u2014 and we were fortunate to get those, you\nknow, and then we were there I don\u2019t know how long and we got a bowl of grass\nsoup every day, you know, and three \u2014 we got about three little potatoes once a\nweek or so, and \u2014 and then they brought in some \u2014 a barrel one time of la \u2014 like\nlittle sardines, they were just in saltwater, they were raw things, you know, dead,\nbut \u2014 and were in saltwater, real heavy brine saltwater. And of course we ate those\nthings like crazy. And w-we associated with all the other prisoners. There was a \u2014\nright near \u2014 across from our barracks was a Polish barracks, and one day there was a\nbig scuffle over there, you saw a whole bunch of them piling on some guy, and you\nwonder what happened. Well, later on I fou \u2014 h-heard that this one Polish guy had\nbeen at another camp, and apparently he had been a snitch or something like that.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup\nout of one of the guy\u2019s hands. So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket\nover his head and slugged him to death. It was just, you know, dog eat dog type\nattitude. And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of kapos, they were called\nkapos. These were German prisoners, but they had given them special rations to be\n\u2014 and they were all big guys, and they\u2019d give them a big board or a club, like a\nbaseball bat, and they were to keep us other prisoners 1n line, to obey orders you\nApril 26, 2013\nknow. Line up, do this, to go here. So everybody tried to stay away from those\nkapos. And so \u2014 but I used to talk to some of the Polish guys over there spoke\nEnglish, and you \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of the esso \u2014 SOE guys, they\nwere British and \u2014 and some of them were Scottish, most of them British. But they\nwere secret type guys, operations guys that were dropped behind the German lines\nto do sabotage and stuff. And they were about \u2014 oh, there must have been 30 or so\nof them in there, 35 or 40. And one day they took \u2014 took \u2014 I heard \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow many, but th \u2014 17 of them went into Weimar, and I guess were tried, they\nbrought them back and killed them. And later on they killed all the other guys. But I\nused to talk to some of those guys, and I found out two of them were from\nScotland, they were twins, and one had had a scar up in his shoulder, and they put a\nscar on the other one\u2019s shoulder just like it. And they had \u2014 one would be up in\nBremen, up in northern Germany, another would be down in Munich and\nsomething would happen, a big explosion or something would happen, they\u2019d catch\nthis guy and \u2014 cause he was there, and he had the evidence, because you know, he\u2019d\nbe \u2014 be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here. I\nwasn\u2019t there. And here that they \u2014 they finally coupled the fact together that this \u2014\nthey were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both. And later on they were\nboth killed. They killed all those SOE guys, the British guys. And the Russian guys\nApril 26, 2013\n\u2014I used to talk to some of the Russians, they\u2019d speak a little bit of English, and one\nof them used to tell me all the time that America would never survive because we\nproduced so many airplanes and stuff like that, and we would financially and\neverything, fold after the war, that we couldn\u2019t stand all that production, and stuff\nlike that. A few little conversations like that we had with the Russians, you know,\nthat did speak some English. And they \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen the\n[indecipherable] but I didn\u2019t know til after the war that they had a building up\nthere, the Russians, a lot of them disappeared. They would take them up there and\nthere was a like a\u2014 a medical examination. They\u2019d stand them on some scales, and\nthey had a hole right behind the scales, there in the wall, and a gun back there, and\nthey\u2019d turn around like that, and shoot them right through the back of the head. And\nthey eliminated a whole bunch of Russians that way by \u2014 by make \u2014 make them\nthink they were giving them a medical, they were standing on the scale, then bam,\nthey\u2019re gone. And the crematorium there was \u2014 I\u2019ve been there a few times after the\nwar, after I been out of there, and they still have the hooks on the wall where they\nused to hang the prisoners, and they would cut them, their legs and bodies, and\nbleed \u2014 let the blood drain out of them into the drain, because then they would burn\nthem in the crematorium upstairs, and they had these little trollies that they\u2019d lay\nthem on and wheel them up there, and then wheel them into these chambers up\nApril 26, 2013\nthere, had about, I don\u2019t know, eight or 10 of these cremation chambers up there,\nwheel them in there and cremate them. Cause they had bodies stacked by the\ncrematorium all day long. The \u2014 used to see so much inhumanity to man, that you\ncouldn\u2019t understand. You\u2019re already a prisoner, and you\u2019d be sta \u2014 we\u2019d stand up\nthere \u2014 we counted \u2014 they called it appel. My number was 78,336, but \u2014 and we\nweren\u2019t tattooed, and we used to ask the kapos, the fa \u2014 the kapos told us that we\nwere not tattooed because we were trading material. I guess \u2014 we \u2014 we assumed that\nthat was going to be trading for German prisoners, you know, that we\u2019re \u2014 we\ncaptured or something. We didn\u2019t \u2014 and know \u2014 don\u2019t really know to this day what\nit was all about, why we weren\u2019t tattooed. But there were about \u2014 later on I found\nthere were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know\n[indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi \u2014 learned\nafter the war that \u2014 from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to\nstarve you to death in about three months. Keep cycling prisoners through there,\ncause they needed ru \u2014 labor, slave labor to work in the pri \u2014 in the factories and\nstuff, you know? So that was one way of just getting rid of them, starve them to\ndeath, rather than shoot them, or some go to \u2014 took energy and took people. I\u2019ve\nheard all sorts of rumors, I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard that the \u2014\nthey used to lie in the \u2014 you\u2019ve seen where the pictures of the Jewish people lined\nApril 26, 2013\nup by ga \u2014 by these pits and they\u2019d shoot them and drop in the pits and they\u2019d cover\nthem up. But the people that had to mow them down, those people had mental\nproblems because they didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, they were killing other humans. So that\u2019s\nwhy the gas chambers came into being, so much. That was to \u2014 cause it wasn\u2019t such\na personal thing. So \u2014 but it\u2019s [indecipherable] because when we stand up for\nappel to be counted, these SS guys would stand up there, they count your heads,\nand they had to have the count right in camp before they would excuse you, go back\nto the barracks, or where you\u2019re gonna go. Sometimes it\u2019d take three hours, and it \u2014\nguys \u2014 some of the guys were \u2014 I weighed 82 pounds when I got out of there, s-\nsome of the guys were skinnier than I was, couldn\u2019t stand up. And you\u2019d try to help\nthem stand up, and the SS guys would wade in there and knock his brains out with a\nrifle butt, and make the prisoners put him on a gunny sack, four of them carry him\nover and stack him by the bodies by the crematorium now. So it\u2019s just \u2014 and there\nwas these two wheel carts running around all day, picking up bodies and hauling\nthem to the crematorium. So it was just not a very good environment. And you just\nwonder \u2014 I used to wonder about how can people be so cruel, and just \u2014 you\u2019re\nalready prisoners, you know, why make it even worse? But we had a guy whose\nname the ger \u2014 the German SS guy up there was named Hauptman. And he would\nstand up there when we were out there, and ge \u2014 weather got kind of cool, and he\nApril 26, 2013\nhad a little bucket, and he had a little cup in it, and he\u2019d say \u2014 he\u2019d pull back his\nuniform, show he had woolen underwear underneath. And he\u2019d say, cold, cold? And\nthen he\u2019d throw \u2014 take a s-scoop up a bucket of this water \u2014 a scoop of this water\nand throw it out over us, you know, like spray us, you know, with a little bit of\nwater. He\u2019d say cold? He just kind of tormented, you know. I don\u2019t know what he\ndid it for, but it \u2014 how \u2014 I don\u2019t know how people get some enjoyment out of that.\nAnyway, that was my feeling. And one day the Americans came over and bombed\nthe \u2014 when we were outside, I was telling you before, living outside on the rocks\nwere \u2014 after that bombing, why, we were asked, will you come down and guide us?\nThey said, if you were soldiers, you have the discipline to help us with the\nwounded. And they had a guy in there, I don\u2019t know h \u2014 the \u2014 he spoke a British\naccent, like he was \u2014 be-been trained in England or something, and he would talk\nto us, you know, he was the guy that they used for communication to us. And then\nthe \u2014 they had another guy in there named \u2014 he was a Dutchman from du \u2014\nHolland, he spoke good English and he spoke German also. So they\u2019d\ncommunicate through him, and he gave us lots of information. But anyway, they\ncome down and got us, they says, you will help us with the wounded people in the\nbombing. Took us up there, and I didn\u2019t help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was\nrunning through this fire and nails and stuff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was\nApril 26, 2013\ngoing as slow as I could. And I saw a wooden \u2014 wooden shoe laying over there, and\nso I kneeled down and put that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German\nguards over there picked up some board and started beating me across the back, and\nyou know, knocked the wind out of me. It seemed like I climbed \u2014 I crawled about a\nmile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed like a mile, and just got \u2014 almost\nknocked me out, cause I couldn\u2019t hardly breathe, you know, knocked the wind out\nof me. And I didn\u2019t help anybody. I just act like I was help \u2014 trying to help some,\nput out the fire, something like that. I just went around, but I didn\u2019t do a darn thing,\nbut no one bothered me after that. Finally, I went back to my building I was in, but I\nsure didn\u2019t help anybody. Some of the guys, I guess, had to help somebody, you\nknow, I didn\u2019t. But anyway, when the Luftwaffe guy came through to look \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014\nI guess he was going to say, look at the bomb damage, he told the \u2014 the other SS\nguys that. And he came in. Well, we had a guy, Ben Sharf(ph) from New Prague,\nMinnesota, he was our waist gunner. He spoke German from his ancestor was\nGerman. And so we said, Ben, you gotta go up, talk to the guy. Tell him we should\nbe in a POW camp. So Jim Fore(ph) and I went up with him, close to him, and he s\n\u2014we told him salute the guy, so he\u2019s \u2014 Ben saluted him, and this German off \u2014\nLuftwaffe officer, he kind of gives a real, slow salute. He didn\u2019t know what to do, I\nthink, cause real slow he kind of went like this, real slow, put his hand down. And\nApril 26, 2013\nthey talked a few minutes, and then the SS tried to break it up, and he pulled his\nrank on them and told them to stand back, and so he talked about five minutes to\nBen, and he told Ben that they didn\u2019t work very good with the Gestapo and the SS,\nbut he\u2019d do what he could, but we should be in a POW camp, he agreed. And we\nthought, well, that\u2019s encouraging news, but \u2014 and he left. And it was, I don\u2019t know,\na month later, when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came\ninto camp, round us up, took us and put into only about 30 - 40 in a boxcar and took\nus to Stalag Luft II over \u2014 over \u2014 over on the Polish border. So, man, and we got\nfood, we got shoes, we got clothes. It was \u2014 it was like being in the Waldorf\nAstoria, you know. But it was really \u2014 really grateful th-that he came about. Now, I\njust found out recently that there\u2019s a book called, \u201cA Higher Call.\u201d And I had heard\nabout a B-17 that had been shot down, riddled pretty badly, and it was down, oh\n3,000 feet or so, and they\u2019d been throwing the radios out and the \u2014 the parachutes\nand everything to lighten plane, they\u2019d get back to England. Well, this \u2014 this\nGerman fighter flew right down beside him, wingtip to wingtip, and tried to motion,\nand \u2014 they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t communicate, but th-the pilot was Brown, Lieutenant\nBrown flying that B-17, trying to get back to England, and this German fighter\npilot was trying to make a motion for him to go to England \u2014 I mean, go to fr \u2014 to\nSweden, closer, across the Channel. And this book is called, \u201cA Higher Call.\u201d\nApril 26, 2013\nNow, this German fighter pilot was a Catholic guy, and he had even some other\nfighter pilots with him, had gone to Goering and tried to resign and knock off some\nof the stuff they was doing, but they almost got shot over it. And this book is called,\n\u201cA Higher Call,\u201d and it\u2019s just recently come out. It\u2019s in English. I got a copy of it\njust this \u2014 this last month. It\u2019s quite intriguing to read, but this guy is the same guy\nthat came into our camp, that got us out of there, and he got us out of there three\ndays before the record \u2014 the record showing Buchenwald whatever, that we \u2014 we\nwere supposed to be eliminated three days \u2014 and he got us out three days before we\nwere supposed to all been killed. The orders had come down from Berlin. And this\nwas just recently because this guy, Mike Dorsey, his father \u2014 his grandfather was in\nBuchenwald with us, his name was Easy(ph) Freeman(ph). And his grandfather\nstarted talking about it in recent years, I guess, and so Mike Dorsey was a movie\nproducer, he decided to look into it, and he went back to Germany for almost a\nyear research, and then went to all the archives in Buchenwald and everything. And\nhe made this movie called, \u201cThe Lost Airman of Buchenwald,\u201d cause we had\nbeen lost because they didn\u2019t know where we were. We weren\u2019t in a POW camp\nuntil after the war they found where we were. So, that\u2019s the reason that movie is\nnamed that, but I\u2019m glad that he \u2014 his grandfather finally started talking about it,\nand he made this movie, and \u2014 and he \u2014 he even got \u2014 I was surprised, but when he\nApril 26, 2013\nwent back to Buchenwald, looked at all the records, he brought me back my arrest\nrecord, my Gestapo arrest picture, and the record of it. Shows USA, and then has it\ncrossed out, and I think it says [indecipherable] or something up there on it.",
        "Q: When you were at Buchenwald, how did \u2014 did you ind \u2014 did you stay with \u2014\nphysically stay with most other allied airman?",
        "A: Oh yes, always.",
        "Q: And how did you conduct yourselves when you were in camp? Did you maintain\nmilitary discipline, did you maintain rank and order?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we all decided the highest ranking officer would be in charge. And\nthat happened to be a New Zealander, the only New Zealander there, but he was a \u2014\na squadron leader, and so we all agreed our \u2014 our highest ranking officer of\nAmericans agreed, we all agreed we would do whatever he said, and we\u2019d act as a\nmilitary unit. And a lot of times even we go to the latrine, that open latrine down\nthere, we\u2019d form up and march like we were soldiers. The SS guys just \u2014 we threw\nthem in fits almost when we do that, because we were acting military, you know,\nlike a unified unit. They didn\u2019t like that. So, yeah, we tried to act as military as\npossible. We\u2019d sing songs you know, and stuff like that, and just to \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nI guess to keep our spirits up. May have tormented them too, but I think it was\nprimarily for our own si \u2014 you know, our own spirits. And we all \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nApril 26, 2013\nand we also when we were there, we all agreed that if we ever got out of there, we\nwould \u2014 we formed a club called the KLB pre-lager Buchenwald. And we would\nall meet every year somewhere, and all of us would attend these meetings. We did\nfor many years. We met in England, we met in the United States, we met all over\nthe places. But all of us guys would get together and it was \u2014 it was just a\ncamaraderie that you develop, you know, by being in these situations. So \u2014",
        "Q: When you were at Buchenwald, did you actually personally witness any allied\nservicemen murdered or killed by the \u2014",
        "A: No, no. I only saw guys get s \u2014 knocked around a little bit. A couple of guys got\npneumonia and died, you know. That was L.C. Beck(ph). He was from\n[indecipherable] Park, California. And Jim Fore(ph) and I, after we got back in\nservice, went to see his parents and tell them, cause they never had any ar \u2014 he \u2014 he\nri \u2014 had written some notes when he was with the French underground, and it\u2019s\ncalled, I think \u201cFighter Pilot.\u201d And he wrote this little book. And his parents we \u2014\nall this information was given to his parents, and they p-printed this little book.\nAnyway, we went to see his parents and tell them how his last days were in\nBuchenwald, and he died of pneumonia. So, other than that I saw no actual \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t see everything, but I \u2014 I just saw no one get ki-killed by the Germans. So \u2014\nApril 26, 2013",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why they sent you to Buchenwald, as opposed to a POW\ncamp?",
        "A: Yes, I think because we had been caught in civilian clothes, with the French\nunderground, and we \u2014 even though they knew who we were, cause they even\nshowed us some pictures of our squad, and showed our \u2014 they had the names of our\nsquad and they had a lot of information on us. And we had dog tags, you know.\nThey knew who we were, but the excuse was, we were caught with \u2014 we were\nsaboteurs and terrorists cause were were caught in civilian clothes with the French\nunderground, so we were sent to Buchenwald. That\u2019s the way I assume it\nhappened. I have no other \u2014 no other reason, you know, that I can think of.",
        "Q: You got on the train at Buchenwald, and head towards Stalag Luft IT. I\nassume you did not know where you were going.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What happens when you got there?",
        "A: Kind of shock. We were herded out of the train, you know. Herded in there like I\ntold you, and pretty soon we were herded in there, and took our clothes off, put us\nin the shower and shaved our heads and bodies and swabbed us and gave us some\nprison clothes, and that was it. We were just in total shock, really, you know, we\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. The other prisoners, some of the prisoners, and\nApril 26, 2013\nthrough, like I say, Ben Sharf(ph), and \u2014 and Dutch, we found out that the other\nprisoners say the only way you'll ever leave this place is up the pipe, and that was\nthe crematortum chimney there, you know. So we were constantly told that, you\nknow, the only way out 1s up the pipe. So we\u2019d all kind of resigned ourselves to\nthat, more or less, you know, and hoping we\u2019d get out and hoping the allies would,\nyou know, get us before the \u2014 we got up the pipe.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So it was just \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how we even kept our spirits up, but\nwe \u2014 we were doing ra \u2014 pretty good. We\u2019d talk a lot and we\u2019d laugh \u2014 sit in \u2014 this\nforming of the KLB club was part of \u2014 we\u2019d have discussions where we were going\nto meet, how we were going to do it, how the organization was going to be and\neverything. So it was \u2014 we \u2014 it was all planned in Buchenwald. And we had a little\nbadge, we drew up a sig \u2014 insignia that we all had, and so it was a \u2014 it was just \u2014 I\nthink it was to keep us busy, but also the camaraderie, you know, that we\u2019d have if\nwe ever got out of there. So \u2014 and I-I don\u2019t know how, some of the guys who got on\nthe march, like I said, some of the guys that we \u2014 when we marched from Stalag\nLuft Il, we got there on that march, some of the guys just gave up. We saw one\nguy, and he went running, cli \u2014 tried to climb the electric fence, you know, some\nguys gave up. I have a \u2014 a strange attitude of life. I always believed in a higher\nApril 26, 2013\npower like the lord Jesus Christ as a savior, and I, as a kid I went to mi \u2014 I\u2019ve got\nrecords showing I went to Sunday school, never missing a \u2014 a Sunday for four\nyears, five years, you know. And \u2014 and when I was put up in front of the firing\nsquad, all I\u2014 my cares all went away, I just flat lined, and I, from that day forward,\nI don\u2019t get excited, I don\u2019t get upset, I don\u2019t get mad, I don\u2019t worry. And when I\nused to work in the engineering stuff, why we\u2019d be on government proposals. We\nhad three guys in my department die of heart attacks in one year, and they issued\nstress cards that you hold and they turn color if you start getting stressed, and the\ndirector\u2019d hold a meeting, and pretty soon you seen him take his little card out of\nhis pocket, lay it down on the table, and I knew he was getting stressed. And after\nthe meeting, guys used to come up to me, cause they\u2019d be hollering, deadlines and\nwhy don\u2019t you do this, why don\u2019t you do that. And they\u2019d come up to me and say,\nlet\u2019s see your card. Show them mine, it was normal. They\u2019d say, what the hell is\nwrong with you, don\u2019t you have any nerves? I said yeah. I says, if this is a problem,\nfix it. If you can\u2019t fix it, what\u2019s the problem?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Kind of strange attitude, but I just \u2014 I just got that, like I say, after that firing\nsquad, I just can\u2019t bring myself to worry. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019d \u2014 hate is a terrible thing too. I\nsee people hate, and I see what hate does, like the Germans hated the Jewish people,\nApril 26, 2013\nand the other people, and I \u2014 I just \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t even hate the Germans, I feel sorry\nfor them. Cause even the SS guys, you know, I don\u2019t agree with it, I don\u2019t like it\nand everything, but I can\u2019t \u2014 I just can\u2019t bring myself to hate. I-I\u2019m a strange duck, I\nguess, but I \u2014 I can\u2019t.",
        "Q: How long were you in Stalag Luft IIT?",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, I think we were only there maybe three months or so.",
        "Q: Did you gain any weight back, were you sick, were you \u2014",
        "A: Oh I \u2014 yeah, I gained some weight back, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much I weighed,\nbut I gained some, and I had my \u2014 I had a wound in my lower leg when I bailed out,\nI don\u2019t know if it was from shrapnel, hooked on some [indecipherable] torn metal\nor what, but I had a pretty good gash just about to the bone, right about halfway up\nmy lower leg, and when I hit the ground, why I turned my ankle, I guess it was kind\nof sore or something, hurt [indecipherable]. And when I was in Buchenwald it\nturned into gangrene, like. It was all numb and just \u2014 couldn\u2019t have any feeling, it\nfelt like just you \u2014 you know how your leg \u2014 how something goes to sleep when\nyou\u2019re [indecipherable] that\u2019s the way it felt. I could hardly feel I was walking on\nit, you know, it was just kind of bad. So when I got to Stalag Luft III, why, they \u2014\nthey tried to put sulfur drugs and stuff on it and nothing would touch it, so then they\nput me in the prison hospital. And the German doctor there wanted to amputate my\nApril 26, 2013\nleg right above the knee. And I \u2014 Captain Daniels, he was \u2014 we had Major jone \u2014\nDavy Jones, and Captain Daniels, who were on the Doolittle raids in Tokyo unit.\nAnd they ended up in Europe and being shot down, and they were in our \u2014 south\ncompound of the da \u2014 Stalag Luft III. Anyway, Captain Daniels there in the\nhospital and I said, no, no, no, I\u2014 you know, listen, I don\u2019t want my leg cut off. And\nso they talked to the German guy, Captain Daniels, and they decided, well, the only\nsolution was to try to save would be to \u2014 they made kind of a tray, a curved tray\nthey laid down on my leg, and they wrapped my leg with gauze about \u2014 looked like\nabout two inches thick, and they hung it up at about a 20 - 30 degree angle, and they\nput a\u2014a-\u2014a metal bucket up there, hung it up there with a nail hole in it, dripping\nsaltwater on it. And they dripped it on my toe, and it just run down the thing. I don\u2019t\nknow if it was a month or something, it dripped \u2014 just dripped every day, it was just\n\u2014 it was miserable, just laying there, but you know \u2014 anyway it was a long time, I\ndon\u2019t know how long it was, but that thing got \u2014 the whole thing got just like a big\nrock cast, cause all that salt and then it\u2019d evaporate, you know. And they come in\none day and they said, well, we\u2019re gonna cut it off, see what we got. So they cut that\n\u2014all that gauze and stuff off of there, and it was just a \u20141f you\u2019ve ever seen a\nparched earth, it\u2019s just cracks and stuff and brown, and rotten looking thing. And\nthen they squeezed it with this gauze and stuff, and the pus is squirt out around my\nApril 26, 2013\nankle, and it volcanoes up around my knee and stuff like that, and they\u2019d squeeze it\nand milk it a little bit. And it stunk like crazy. So he looked at it, and they sh \u2014 they\nkind of shook their heads, and they said, well, it\u2019s doing something, so they\nwrapped it up again, put the saltwater up there again and kept dripping it on there,\nand I don\u2019t know, seemed like a month, I don\u2019t know how long it was, really. And it\ngot all hard again, they took it off, and it was starting to grow skin back. So they\nkept wrap \u2014 wrapping in gauze, and stuff like that, and they we \u2014 and they finally\nsent me back to the \u2014 my barracks back at the saw \u2014 compound, and I was there and\nI was \u2014 it was hard to walk on, but it was \u2014 I was limping around, and it was getting\na little better all the time. And they would \u2014 I \u2014 I forget how often the \u2014 but they\nwould rewrap it. I don\u2019t remember, my mind 1s gone, I guess, on how often, but\nevery once in a while they\u2019d \u2014 every couple of days, why they\u2019d rewrap the leg, and\nI'd walk on it. It hurt, but I walked on it, and then I was in \u2014 I was \u2014 guess I was in\nthe theater one night there when all of a sudden they come in and said, we\u2019re \u2014\nwe're gonna leave the camp. Cause we\u2019d seen all the low flying airplanes and stuff\ngoing, you know, to-towards the Russian front over there, and we\u2019d heard a lot of\nrumors about it in camps, what\u2019s going on. And so Colonel Clark, he was a colonel\nmajor \u2014 he was General Clark at Colorado Springs there, the air \u2014 air academy\nthere later on, but he was a colonel in our camp there at south compound. Major\nApril 26, 2013\nDavy Jones and Captain Daniels and Colonel Clark. Anyway, Colonel Clark\nasked me, he says, that we\u2019re gonna go on this march [indecipherable] we\u2019re\ngonna leave. There\u2019s about three foot of snow on the ground, and Colonel Cl \u2014\nColonel Clark asked me, he says, you want to stay here, and be liber \u2014 or be \u2014 we \u2014\nget liberated by the Russians? Or do you want to go with the masses, it\u2019s your\nchoice. So I says, Pll go with the masses of people, and maybe the cold and the\nwalking, the circulation will help. He says, you think you can make it? I says, well,\nI\u2019m gonna try. So I went on the march, I was limping and it hurt, but every day\nseemed to be a little bit better, cause I think the circulation and the cold \u2014 it wasn\u2019t\ngonna re-infect, I don\u2019t think, with the cold, you know. And I think the circulation\nwas helped by just walking on it, just constantly walking, cause we walked a long\ntime. And finally got better. I was still limping when I got home, but \u2014",
        "Q: How many days did you march?",
        "A: It seemed like a month, but I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how many days we \u2014 and I\nknow the first time we marched, what \u2014 60 \u2014 I think we marched about 65 miles or\nsomething, I had heard, I don\u2019t know how miles it was, but it was \u2014 seemed like a\ncouple days. We stopped at, I think a brick factory, or something like that. Once \u2014 I\nstopped at a barn once with hay, and that were \u2014 was pretty nice. And two or three\ntimes on that trip we stopped at places that we got warm, and they gave us some\nApril 26, 2013\nsoup. And I don\u2019t really remember how many days it was. I\u2019m sure other people\nknow what \u2014 how many days that was on the trip, but \u2014",
        "Q: Did you understand why you were being marched?",
        "A: [indecipherable] evacuate from the Russian front, cause the Russians were\ncoming, they were close by apparently, and they wanted to get us away from the\nRussians.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, you don\u2019t want the Russians to get ahold of us, they wanted to just keep us\nas prisoners, cause we were material that they could trade, or hold hostage, or\nsomething like that, you know. We just assumed that we were hostages to be held,\nand the more of us that they could keep, the \u2014 the better. And getting us away from\nthe fronts, you know, and we ended up down at Moosburg, which was pretty\ncrowded, had lots of prisoners there, you know. And then we heard rumors about\nthe allies not too far away, and they \u2014 they had radio there too, you know, their\nsecret radios, they had crystal sets. And I heard \u2014 we were told that \u2014 that if they\ntried to evacuate us from Moosburg to be \u2014 light a building on fire or something,\ncause they\u2019d have planes circling. And we noticed that at about 35,000 feet or\nsomething, way up in the sky, we\u2019d hear these airplanes, and once in a great while\nyou could see one of them, but they\u2019re \u2014 just barely see them. And they were \u2014\nApril 26, 2013\ncircled day and night, and they said, light a building on fire, something, if anything\n\u2014 they started to kill anybody or anything like that, and they would make an\nimmediate attack on the camp. And we were shocked one day was \u2014 I was down by\nthe gate cause there was a lot of commotion and stuff and the Germans were\ncoming by, and there are tanks rolling by and everything else, and I think Captain\nhe \u2014 and Captain Daniels was down there close to me too, and the German guards\nall of a sudden were running to a \u2014 one the buildings, their \u2014 their little guard shack\nthere. And \u2014 and then we saw what was happening, the SS guy there, there was tank\npeople out there, were telling the \u2014 motioning them to come out and help fight, I\nguess, cause we were right down there by the gate watching them, and all of a\nsudden one of these Germans put a Panzer fist, a German anti-tank gun right into\nthose \u2014 his own guys, those Luftwaffe guys at the \u2014 at the gate in the building there,\njust blew it wide open. Holy mackerel, you know, what\u2019s going on, cause all hell\nwas breaking loose, you know. You hear gunfire and cannon fire and everything\nelse, and the Americans were shelling pretty high with large cannons, because you\ncould look up to Moosburg and see the tar sliding off the roofs of the houses and\nstuff. So, was pretty noisy for a while, and all of a sudden the American tanks\nstarted coming by and we saw the goings on, and \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t five minutes\nbehind the front lines, here come Patton, riding in a Jeep. It\u2019s ju \u2014 standing up in\nApril 26, 2013\nhis Jeep, and he motioned they \u2014 he motioned a tank or something, break down the\nfence, he come driving right inside the camp and stood up in his Jeep, and told\neverybody, you know, to be quiet or something. He gave a little talk and told us not\nto go into town, and stuff like that. And I was shocked to see him there, I was \u2014 you\nknow, just dumbfounded. Here he had his pearl handled revolvers on, that you\nknow, like, what was it \u2014 what\u2019s her name, some, you know, singer had given him,\nyou know. And I-I was shocked, cause he wasn\u2019t five minutes for find the \u2014 behind\nthe front lines. So we just stayed in camp and then they let us out, and I went up to\nwhere the Americans had put a pontoon bridge across the river up there, right in\ntown, 1n the south side of town. And I went up there one time, and the \u2014 the \u2014 I was\namazed that the engineers were out there putting a bridge back across the river; it\nhad been cut loose. They were trying to get tanks across the river, and the Germans\nwere up higher, shelling that down there to the river, and they cut the bri \u2014 their\npontoon bridge loose one time, and it floated kind of down the river, and they had\nthese little boats out there, outboard [indecipherable] towing that thing back up and\ncon \u2014 reconnected. And shells were, you know, dropping in the water down in \u2014\nabove them there. I was shocked, I \u2014 now I realized, you know, I\u2019d be running and\nhiding, rather than being there, but you could see it, the splash of the water and\nstuff, from where we were. And I remember seeing that \u2014 that German flag come\nApril 26, 2013\noff that steeple up there in Moosburg, and the American flag go up. What a \u2014 what\na feeling. You can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s just \u2014",
        "Q: How long did it take before they evacuated you?",
        "A: It was a few days, because I know they brought 1n the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 you know,\nthere\u2019s tanks, there are armored cars and stuff, and I got r\u2014 and they brought in a\nsoup kitchen from their military guys at the front lines, and they had some \u2014 some\nsoup, bean soup with corned beef in it. And I got a couple of bowls of that, and I ate\nit. Should never have done it, because I got so sick, I \u2014 I \u2014 I-I was wishing someone\nwould shoot me in the head, cause I never been so sick in my life. I laid there in\nbed, in that bunk for I don\u2019t know how long. But I don\u2019t know how long \u2014 how\nmany days I was there, but I \u2014 I-I \u2014 I\u2019ve never been so sick in my life. That \u2014 but\nthat corn \u2014 I call it corn willie soup, it was so good.",
        "Q: Was this a question of too rich for your system?",
        "A: Oh yeah, cause we had been, you know \u2014 bad re \u2014 not very much rations and\nstuff like that, and yeah, it was just too rich. And immediately when the \u2014 and\nfinally the medics came in and cut us off all that stuff, you know. And I was so sick\nI didn\u2019t go to \u2014 a lot of the guys were \u2014 when we went to Spremberg and they flew\nus out of Spremberg, that was a \u2014 an air force \u2014 German air force base not far\naway, why I \u2014I didn\u2019t go to spr \u2014 sprem \u2014 to |\u2014 Camp Lucky Strike, I was taken to\nApril 26, 2013\nLi\u00e9ge, Belgium, to a medical hospital up there. I was there a few weeks before I got\nto go to th\u2014 Camp Lucky Strike, cause gosh I was \u2014 I was sick. I had the \u2014 I still\nwas limping on my leg, and I \u2014 I was so sick to my stomach I felt like I was gonna\ndie.",

        "A: In New York.",

        "A: Oh yeah, the Statue of Liberty and everything. Fantastic. Yeah, quite \u2014 quite an\nemotional feeling, and met there by the Red Cross, and the Red Cross let us \u2014 gave\nus high \u2014 I think I got a little bit of money they gave, and then I \u2014 they let us send\ntelegrams to our families, and then later we \u2014 we were given \u2014 you know, put on\ntrains to head home, gave a little bit of money. Great feeling",

        "Q: What was it like seeing them?",
        "A: Can\u2019t explain it. Just being home, you know, it\u2019s a great thing. And seeing the\nfamily, and then the \u2014 I stayed in the \u2014 I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t discharged yet, but I was\nable to stay home, and I worked with GCA \u2014 Ground Approach Systems, cause\nGilfillan was building radars and stuff for ground approaches, training, and I was\nApril 26, 2013\nstill in the military, so I went to Mines Field which is LA International Airport, but\nthe military side of it, and I\u2014 we\u2019d go there every day and worked to put radios in\nplanes and tune them up and stuff like that, cause the pilots were practicing landing\nwith that new radar Gilfillan built. So I worked there for, I don\u2019t know, a couple of\nmonths. At first I was assigned \u2014 I ga \u2014 got to go home, and then I was at \u2014 at \u2014 got\nto what was it, Santa Monica, at a hotel out there, and then \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t required\nto stay there, I had a home tel \u2014 hotel room, but they said I could live at home if I\nwanted to, so I just lived at home with my parents. And I\u2019d drive out to ma-march \u2014\nMines Field every day at LA International Airport, and so I don\u2019t know how long\nI worked there until I got out of the service, and sent to San Bernardino, and I was\ndischarged from there. But in the meantime I\u2019d read in the paper and the magazines\nabout television and some stuff, and Dr. se \u2014 de \u2014 Lee De Forest, who invented the\nvacuum tube and Sanabria, his cohort had formed an engineering, electrical\nengineering and TV school in \u2014 on \u2014 in Hollywood. And so I got ahold of them and\nwanted to know if I could go to school there and get a degree in electrical\nengineering and learn TV and stuff like that, and so I signed up for it. So I went to s\n\u2014I was in school three days after I got discharged out of San Bernardino. So I\nwent right to school, and got out of there \u2014 went there f\u2014 about three years and got\nout, and the first thing I did was \u2014 cause TV was just coming on the market, I went\nApril 26, 2013\nin the TV business. I went to work for a guy that was \u2014 bought a TV, and then went\nin it myself. And RCA was advertising they were gonna make a \u2014 a projection tube,\nfive inch projection tube. And they\u2019d had a little 10 inch table model TV. And\nBausch and Lomb was talking about a lens for this RCA thing. So I was\ninquisitive, I called them up and asked RCA if I could get is \u2014 one of those tubes,\nand called Bausch and Lomb, see if I could get a lens, and I did it, and I took a 10\ninch RCA TV and converted it to \u2014 made a little projection set. I put a 12 by 16 foot\nprojection set in the Shrine Auditorium in 1947 for the Rose Bowl game and the\nRose Parade. I sold 200 and \u2014 I sold 2400 s \u2014 I think \u2014 no, s \u2014 fe \u2014 was it \u2014 about a\nthousand seats anyway, at two dollars and 40 cents apiece for the whole Rose Bowl\ngame and the Rose Parade. I \u2014 I \u2014 I was sweating that, because I had two of these\nlittle TV projector things made up, and with a RCA chassis because if one failed, I\nthought I\u2019d re \u2014 I\u2019d get shot if something happened. But I went to Bodie(ph) plastic\nscreens, I could contact a guy in Hollywood that \u2014 cause I knew they made \u2014 you\nknow, they had their experimental TVs and ther \u2014 not TVs, but projections up there.\nThey already project them from the rear. So I got ahold of this Bodie(ph) plastic\nscreen guy out in \u2014 1n Venice, made the screens, and asked him if he can make me a\nscreen. So I had a 12 by 16 foot, they made a wooden frame and put this plastic on\nit, and they s \u2014 they\u2019d put the projector back there and ha-have a hot spot, and\nApril 26, 2013\nthey\u2019d spray with a \u2014 like a spray gun with plastic, and it would make it thicker in\nthe center, so 1t made it even, the light even. Wouldn\u2019t have a hot spot in the center.\nSo I parj \u2014 project it from the rear, and had a good time. I didn\u2019t have any\ncomplaints at all, and all these people over there got to see the Rose Bowl game. I\nmade money and \u2014",
        "Q: How long did it take after the war before di \u2014 di\u2014 before you spoke about your\nexperiences at Buchenwald?",
        "A: I si\u2014told my parents a little bit about it. And then there\u2019s a family down about\nfour or five houses from my parents that was German ancestry and I \u2014 but the\nneighbors would ask me about stuff like that, I'd tell them a little bit about it. And\nthat family, the German family says oh, that\u2019s all a lie. There\u2019s no \u2014 no\nconcentration camps in Germany and stuff like that. They didn\u2019t believe any of it.\nAnd other people\u2019d say \u2014 you say something about it, a-are you sure that\u2019s true, you\nknow. Did that really happen? And they just question it, so we just \u2014 most \u2014 all of\nus, you talk to them, we sort of stopped talking about it. And I was \u2014 but I to \u2014 I just\ntell people \u2014 a lot of people about it, and a lot of people kind of yeah, yeah, yeah,\nsomething like that. But I never talked about it much, but about f\u2014 I don\u2019t know, 10\nor 15 years ago, I don\u2019t know how long it was, but I used to go to the VA hospital in\nLong Beach. And I went there one day, I \u2014 cause every month I\u2019d \u2014 I'd go in once a\nApril 26, 2013\nmonth and they\u2019d check my blood pressure and give me a\u2014 a -\u20141if I need vitamins,\nor whatever I needed, you know? And I went in there one day and I heard \u2014 they\npaged me to report to a certain office, and I did. I went in there and the guy sat\ndown and he says, I\u2019m the psychiatrist here at the hospital, and he said, I want to\ntalk to you. So I sat \u2014 sat down. He says, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re \u2014 right up here you\nwere in Buchenwald concentration camp, and he says, you\u2019re a liar. Just plain out,\nyou\u2019re a liar. You \u2014 you were in a POW camp. I says, doctor, I know the difference.\nYou don\u2019t. I just got up and walked out. But, you know, you get things like that, and\nso you kind of \u2014 you kind of \u2014 why talk about it? And the only time we really talk\nabout it was when our group got together, you know, we\u2019d talk about our stories,\nyou know, and stuff like that. And it hasn\u2019t been just til \u2014 til recent years, and then \u2014\nI don\u2019t even know how it happened, but the Santa Ana \u201cRegister\u201d heard about I\nguess this deal through s-someone, I don\u2019t know how they heard about it even. And\nthey called me up one time, wanted to come and talk to me. So they sent a reporter\nout to talk to me and then they put a whole thing in the Santa Ana \u201cRegister\u201d\nabout me and Buchenwald concentration camp and so forth. And pe \u2014 I started\ngetting calls, and then got a call from the Kiwanis Club down in Newport Beach,\nand they wanted me to come and talk to them about the experience. Got a call from\nthe Jewish war veterans. And you started getting all these calls that people want to\nApril 26, 2013\nknow about it, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s happened in recent years, you know. And it\u2019s\njust \u2014 it\u2019s strange. And then these movies would come out, you know, like Mike\nDorsey\u2019s film, and stuff like that. And it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, the last couple of\nyears or so it\u2019s just kind of come alive again.",
        "Q: Did you receive any compensation from the German government?",
        "A: I\u2014I got s\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from the German government, the IMF, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, and I got, I don\u2019t know, seems to me like it was three\nor 4,000 dollars, something like that, quite a number of years ago. But I ran across\nsome of that paperwork recently, I was going through a bunch of stuff, and I don\u2019t\nremember exactly how much it was, but it was something like that, three or 4,000\ndollars, I was surprised. But it came from the IMF. I was surprised that \u2014 how they\ndid that whole thing. I thought, why did it come the International Monetary Fund?\nAnd I don\u2019t know if it was directly from Germany, or if 1t was negotiations. I \u2014 I\nknew nothing about how that all come about.",
        "Q: Were you decorated?",
        "A: No. I got a Purple Heart, and I think a air medal, few things like that, but no,\nnothing else.",
        "Q: This interview is going to be \u2014 become part of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum\u2019s permanent collection. It\u2019s going to be used by historians and\nApril 26, 2013\nscholars of the Holocaust for many, many years to come. Is there anything you\u2019d\nlike to say in closing?",
        "A: The only thing I\u2019d like to say is, ve been very interested in the school system\nfor a long time, cause I have had a couple of kids go through it. My wife and I were\nboth involved heavily in the \u2014 going to school board meetings and stuff, and I was\nastonished at all \u2014 how little history and real information is being given and the \u2014\nthe \u2014 I don\u2019t think the teaching professions care much about this type of thing. And\nI\u2019ve always felt, and I\u2019ve heard many years that those who forget history are\ndeemed to relive it. And it scares me that the young people today know very little\nabout that stuff. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s maybe it\u2019s \u2014 a lot of 1t\u2019s kind of nasty, but I-I just\nthink that \u2014 that the school systems and the colleges even are \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to a lot of\ncollege professors and stuff. Like, my older son used to come home and tell me\nwhat the college professors are saying. And it just disturbed me that they are not\nmore knowledgeable. They should be, I think. And I just \u2014 that\u2019s part \u2014 it just\nbothers me that they\u2019re not educating the kids to really \u2014 what really went on in\nhistory, cause they don\u2019t even teach, I don\u2019t think, good old-time history, how this\ncountry was founded, you know. Our freedoms that we have. If you go to \u2014 if\nyou\u2019ve traveled much, and a lot of people haven\u2019t \u2014 I have, quite a bit in other\ncountries, and see how they operate and what\u2019s going on, and this is still the\nApril 26, 2013\ngreatest country there is, and the freedoms we have. But they seem to be gradually\ntaken away from us, and the \u2014 things now are happening today that disturb me\ngreatly, because it\u2019s just that little encroachment upon these little liberties and little\nthings, they\u2019re just going away, and th \u2014 though that\u2019s not right, you know, this, that\nand the other thing. But this country didn\u2019t grow, it didn\u2019t grow financially \u2014 it\u2019s\nbeen the most successful country in the world. And why people can\u2019t see that \u2014 to\nme it\u2019s obvious. And why do people from all over the world want to come to the\nUnited States? And that bothers me a great deal, that we don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it\njust \u2014 I\u2019m just disturbed by the way our country seems to be going, and that fact that\nyoung people don\u2019t really know anything about history. That part bothers me. My\ngrandkids, I\u2019m glad to say that I\u2014 I was able last year in April to \u2014 when I went to\nBuchenwald, and \u2014 by invitation of the Germans; my wife and I; my younger son\nand my grandkids; we took them, we went there, they were \u2014 spent a week at\nBuchenwald area, hearing all the speeches and seeing the graves and seeing all the\nhistory that took place there. And they were \u2014 my dau \u2014 granddaughter 1s fif \u2014 just\nturned 15, she\u2019s old enough to understand, she asked a lot of questions, so she was\ninquisitive. I just think more kids need to know about what really went on. I know\nthat some of it is nasty and bad, but that\u2019s life. And protecting them and saying\neverything\u2019s just hunky dory and sm-smiley roses all the time is not the way real\nApril 26, 2013\nlife is. So that part bothers me, I just \u2014 I-I just have strong feelings about our school\nsystem and things like that, I\u2014 I\u2019m bothered enough [indecipherable]. But it does,\nit bothers me a great deal that even grown-up people don\u2019t know. And\n[indecipherable] today, a lot of people still deny the Holocaust happened. How can\nthey deny it with so much evidence and \u2014 and everything? And yet people, th-they\nseem to have their head in the sand, to me. And maybe I\u2019m just an old \u2014 ignorant\nold man, but I-I feel that people need to o-open their eyes and look around, cause\nwe sure don\u2019t want to relive it. Anyway, that\u2019s my feelings, I just \u2014 you\u2019re stuck\nwith them.",

        "A: I didn\u2019t go \u2014 I went two years of college then, before I went in service, and then I\n\u2014I went after I got out of the service. I went to engineering \u2014 electrical engineering\nschool.",
        "A: You would ask me that question. 1941, I think.",
        "A: I was coming back from the mountains, went and got in the mountains and I\nheard on the news that we\u2019d been bombed in Pearl Harbor, and I already knew the\nwar was going on in Germany, and lots of news, stuff about it. And a buddy of\nApril 26, 2013\nmine I ran around with, my best friend, why he and I said well, it\u2019s time we tried to\nget in the service. I was crazy in those days, I was about 17 or something. So I tried\nto \u2014 tried to get in the Canadian roy \u2014 RCAF, the Canadian Air Force. And you had\nto move to Canada and live there for two years before they\u2019d take you. So we\ndidn\u2019t do that. So I just waited until a draft notice came, and went in the \u2014 went into\nbasic training that I di \u2014 didn\u2019t know where I was going. I got on a bus and they\ndrove me to Fresno, California, and that was a \u2014 a basic training.",

But went\nto basic training at Fresno, and after basic training I went to Sioux Falls, South\nDakota for radio school. Went from there to Salt Lake City for continued training,\nstuff like that, radio and communications and stuff like that. And then I was sent to\nDyersburg, Tennessee for training in B-17s as a radio operator, and top gunner on\nApril 26, 2013\nthe B-17. And after training there I had \u2014 I wanted to be a fighter pilot, so I applied\nfor fighter training, and nothing happened, so after \u2014 just about the time that we was\nready to ship overseas with \u2014 through basic training there at Dyersburg, Tennessee\nin B-17s, and dummy missions, you know, and navigation stuff like that. And flew\ndown over Cuba, and stuff, was just long range navigation training. Orders came\nthrough find us, report to Fort Worth, Texas for fighter school. I was already on a\ncrew, so I was \u2014 now I\u2019m gonna stay with the crew right there, and train with them\nfor months, and so we went to Germany. I went to fra \u2014 I went to England and\nthen re \u2014 Germany later. So, went to the 91*' bomb group in Bassingbourn,\nEngland, and that was shortly after the Memphis Belle completed its 25 missions,\nthe first plane to finish a \u2014 a group of missions, to go home, and then \u2014",

It\u2019s something new for a young guy, you\nApril 26, 2013\nknow, and was interesting to see the \u2014 how long the radio \u2014 how far you could reach\non the radios, where you could talk to Australians, and was up in altitude, cause we\nhad a training antenna that we could let out in the \u2014 in the radio room, you know.\nAnd I thought it was interesting, you know.",

So I thought I\u2019d do\nthat, but they gave you a-aptitude tests. And when I was in Fresno basic training,\nthey give you these tests, all sorts of stuff, mechanical and electrical and everything\nelse. And I was able to do real good in electrical and they needed electronic people\nthen, so they chose me to go to radio school, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, so that\u2019s\nwhere I went.",

I know there was a bunch of people on it. There was about six nurses\nand a bunch of us guys on there \u2014 there. We landed in \u2014 in s \u2014 I think in \u2014 in Wales\nfirst, and then we took off from there and went \u2014 some people left, you know, we\nwent down to Bassingbourn.",

        "A: Oh, it was interesting, you know. A young person always \u2014 things are interesting\nto a young person. And the nice countryside, the \u2014 the \u2014 the base was a\u2014 was a\nRAF base, had been before, and then they carved out a lot of trees, they cut trees\ndown and we parked some of the planes in the a \u2014 the trees, for camouflage, I guess\nreally. And some of the buildings, we had Quonset huts, we had brick buildings, we\nhad different types of buildings, cause a lot of them were put in just to \u2014 you know,\nas new construction, because we moved in and taken over this whole milit \u2014 British\nbase. So \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. There was British people there. We\u2019d go to the little pubs and stuff like\nthat, and eat, you know, and no, it was good, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, very well. The girls would come to the base and walk around, they\u2019d talk\nwith us and stuff like that, you know, and carry on conversations and then they \u2014\nthey\u2019d go to town, the people \u2014 I only had one instance where I \u2014 I was on leave, go\n\u2014 go \u2014I was going to go to London, I was on the train over there \u2014 their trains have\na compartment on one side, and a aisle down the other side there, you na \u2014 a\ncompartment with about six people in them. And I was going to London one time\nand there was a little kid in there. I reached in my pocket and took out a Hershey\nApril 26, 2013\nchocolate bar, and gave this little kid. And the mother scolded me for tormenting\nthis little kid, because that\u2019s the only candy bar he had and he probably will ever\nhave, and I shouldn\u2019t have given it to him. And I thought I was doing him a favor.",
        "A: Cause the little kids would \u2014 you\u2019d go up and down the street and the little kids\nwould see a American G.I., cause we always had, you know, spearmint chewing\ngum, or stuff like that, and they\u2019d say, got any gum, chum? And they\u2019d come out\nand grab you by the legs or something like that, say that, you know, and almost\nknock you down. And so, we just \u2014 you know, took candy and stuff for the little\nkids, and give it to them, you know, thought that was good. But that\u2019s the only time\nI ever had a run in with one that was \u2014 she just jumped all over me for giving her\nlittle kid that candy bar.",
        "A: Was kind of interesting city. I was there one time when \u2014 just after a V-1 hit\ndown by Hyde Park, and dug a big crater down there. And they had had these guys\nthat were like spit and argue club guys, or all these guys down there complaining\nabout the war and everything else, and you know, just carrying on talking and\nyakking, I don\u2019t know what they believed in or anything, but it was kind of\ninteresting to listen to him and \u2014 yakking and talking. And walk around Hyde Park\nApril 26, 2013\nand different place in London and I \u2014 interesting time. I \u2014 I thought I was \u2014 lost my\narm there one time. I went in \u2014 I got a hotel in \u2014 with one of the other guys I was\nwith, and we \u2014 I was laying in this bed, and it had a bar on the side of it and I\nsomehow li \u2014 laid my arm down at the side and that bar was right under my arm,\nand it cut off my circulation so my arm was \u2014 went to sleep, and I woke up in the\nmorning and tried to move the arm, and it wasn\u2019t there, and I reached over trying to\nfind for it, it was hanging outside the bed, you know, that was kind of interesting.\nThen mis \u2014 the people, I had no trouble with the people, I think was pleasant.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. No, didn\u2019t have time.",
        "A: Well, quite a bit of training, because in \u2014 1n the radio thing, the Americans had\nfive letter code groups, they\u2019d send groups of five letters, and then you had to\ndecode \u2014 decipher that into real language, from the SOI standard operating\nprocedures, and the British had four letter groups. So the navigator and myself went\nto another base in England and trained \u2014 cross trained with the British, receiving\ntheir codes and stuff like that, and their diver \u2014 procedures that they had. So we\nApril 26, 2013\nwent about th \u2014 I think it was a couple weeks of training, cross training with the\nBritish, then went back to base, cause \u2014 cause we were in a lot \u2014 with the British a\nlot, you know, naturally, we was in their country still.",
        "A: I was the radio operator by the center of the aircraft, just behind the bomb bays,\nand I had gun above the head. And it was a B-17G, we just got the Gs model in\nwhen I was there. And I always used to go down the lines and see a lot of planes\nthat come back were pretty shot up, and we wondered how they flew, and part of\ntheir tails missing and everything else, and big holes in them, you know. And it was\nkind of interesting to see them, you know, cause I was inquisitive.",
        "A: I never really seemed to get too excited about that. I always thought \u2014 I always\nfigured that if the plane went down, my idea was I\u2019d \u2014 I'd go down with it, and it\u2019d\ncrash and I\u2019d get out of the crash somehow. But my mind changed when I got shot\ndown.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact day that we had there. I think there was training\nflights that we went just to the coast, turn around, come back, three of them. And\nApril 26, 2013\nthen on the day of the \u2014 the bomb, when I fir \u2014 when I was shot down, why we got\nup quite early in the morning, about four o\u2019clock or something like that, I don\u2019t\nremember the exact time. It was early. Had the briefing and then we took off and we\nused to climb at certain altitudes [indecipherable] because you have a lot of\nairplanes up there. So they have a colored flares, and you have a \u2014 each plane has a\ndifferent colored flare and they fire it off up there at altitude and then you\nrendezvous onto that group. That\u2019s your definition, and you start from there on your\nmission. So, you climb to a pretty good altitude before you start to cross the\nChannel. And it was interesting to, before that, that the V-1s that they were firing\non England, they were these kind of a putt, you hear them flapping, cause they had\na \u2014a pulse jet motor on them, and you\u2019d hear those at night. And as long as they\nweren\u2019t coming right over your head. Why? Because they didn\u2019t steer them, they\njust had an angle, wherever they go, and then they would kick the rudder over and \u2014\nthe horizontal stabilizers rather, and they just dive straight down. The British\ndeveloped a technique to keep those from coming into England. They had a fighter\n\u2014 real big fighters called nape \u2014 Typhoon, with a Napier Sabre big engine on it.\nWasn\u2019t \u2014 I guess it was too heavy to be a real good fighter like the Spitfire. And\nthey would send those out over the Channel when they hear \u2014 see these things\ncoming in, cause they flew at a certain altitude, and the Typhoons would fly along\nApril 26, 2013\nthe side of them and flap the wing on them and tip the gyro in, and they just spiral\ninto the ocean. So the British really did a good job on downing many, many\nhundreds of those darn B-I1s.",
        "A: Yeah, well they just fly alongside. They were doing about maybe, I don\u2019t know,\n300 miles an hour, 250 mile an hour, fly alongside and just flap the wing, you\nknow, tip it a little bit. The \u2014 the \u2014 tip the gyro in the rocket and they just spiral into\nthe ocean. It was a clever idea, you know, and didn\u2019t take \u2014 they didn\u2019t fire on them\nbecause if they shot them, and then they explode and you'd fly right through all that\ndebris.",
        "A: So it was a clever idea. Didn\u2019t take much you know, and the air \u2014 Typhoons\ncould catch them real easy. So I thought that was real clever, myself.",
        "A: Th-The \u2014 what day, you mean?\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, I remember going over and seeing the \u2014 the coastline and \u2014 and seeing\nsome other planes where ya \u2014 I think we took \u2014 some planes took wa \u2014 one hit \u2014 I\nremember over Calais, France, I think it was, one took a \u2014 took a direct hit in the\nbomb bay, it looked like, cause it just blew up, disappeared, you know. And then we\nwent on to our target, 1t was a dru \u2014 it was an underground airbase, fighter base, and\nthey had caves and stuff in these hills where they\u2019d put the fires inside, and\neverything was camouflaged, so it was a hard thing to find, but they were trying to\nknock out as much of those fighters as they could because of the invasion forces,\nyou know. So we made a \u2014 went out and found the initial point, which is an\nidentifiable point that you \u2014 they can find to turn on, and they drove cer \u2014 certain\naltitudes, certain speed and in a certain direction, and to the target. We met the first\ntime and that \u2014 the bombardier couldn\u2019t find the target, camouflaged. So you do a\nno-no, we \u2014 we made a 360 degree turn and went back to same initial point and\nstarted the same course, same altitude, same everything. By that time the barrage\nflak that you see all the time hadn't got us the first time, so they had their tracking\nflak on us in. They knew our altitude, our course, they knew where we were going.\nSo the tail gunner says, about 300 yards off the tail, had a burst. Next one through\nthe waist, and the left wing wen-went off, and we caught on fire and started into a\nspiral. And I always figured I\u2019d ride the airplane down, get out of the crash or\nApril 26, 2013\nsomething. But you change your mind rather quickly when that happens, so I \u2014 guys\njust bailing out, you know, when they gave the order to bail out. And I started out of\nthe radio room and heard the ball turret gunner was spinning around, so I figure the\ncommunications were shot out or something, so I grabbed a big tuner, you know,\nthe transmitter in the radio room and started beating on top of it. And he pointed the\nguns down and the handles come up and I flipped it out and he pops out. He was a\nlittle guy, and he popped out of there so quick I couldn\u2019t believe it. Hand him his\nparachute, he sta \u2014 snapped it on and boy he was out the win \u2014 out the door. I was\nright behind him.",
        "A: What \u2014 what else did I take?",
        "A: Was about \u2014 I think about 27,000 - 27 five \u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: We were about \u2014 about 30,000 we started.",
        "A: But we were in a dive, sort of a spiral dive, you know.\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: So.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have too much, I guess the excitement, and all that stuff, that you don\u2019t\nthink about it, I was just trying to get out of that fiery airplane. And so we\u2019d always\nbeen told to delay your jump, cause they may \u2014 may shoot you coming down in the\nparachute, you know, a fighter come by, or something like that. So I had delayed\nmy parachute til I could kind of see the leaves on the trees. And I popped the chute\nand it seemed like I took a couple swings and I was on the ground. And then there\nwas a\u2014a little boy, a lady, and a \u2014 at the end of this field where I landed in, there\nwas a little boy over there and a lady, and so I \u2014 he ran over towards me and I\nreached in my kneepads to get my escape kit out and there\u2019s a little \u2014 we have\nbooks in there, a little book that says English and French, you know, cause we\n[indecipherable] France, and maps and stuff. And he pointed the [indecipherable]\nin the book, and he says hide, in there. So they took off. So I stuck my parachute\nunder some bushes there at the edge of the field, and ran through the forest and got\nto the other side and I didn\u2019t know going to the other side is that I was getting\ndeeper in the forest, but I come to a clearing. Now that little boy don\u2019t want to go\nout in there, cause gonna see me. So I just heard these \u2014 all these Germans running,\nApril 26, 2013\nyou could hear them, and there\u2019s \u2014 their canister they carry with them is \u2014 their gas\nmask rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some\nbushes right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and\nhear when the Germans come up, he\u2019s \u2014 I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he\nwas so close, but he was looking way out ahead, he wasn\u2019t looking down at his feet.\nAnd I don\u2019t know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, 1t was probably an hour or\nsomething like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn\u2019t breathe for a couple\nhours, I don\u2019t think. But anyhow, they finally went away and then I just walked\nthrough the forest and \u2014 and I got my maps and there \u2014 they had maps that they\ngave you were like a silk handkerchief, but their maps were detailed, they had the\ncurves in the road, you could see paths in the forest, and they had \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhere I got them, but they were very good. So I saw a curve in the road and it\u2019s\nwhere I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one road, a\ndivided highway. And then I heard a big racket coming, I was right in the middle of\nit, it was quite wide, their divided highway was, and there\u2019s grass and s \u2014 lot of trees\ngrowing in the middle of it. And around the corner I get \u2014 hear them coming. So I\ndove into the grass and hear a bunch of German tanks and everything else was\ncoming by, and guys in, I don\u2019t know, looked like armored cars or something, I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t able to really look, I was \u2014 buried myself in the grass, hoping they\nApril 26, 2013\ndidn\u2019t see me. And they went on by, didn\u2019t see me, so I thought[indecipherable]\nget out of here, so I headed back. And every time I seen one walking, I would just\nveer off at an angle. I wouldn\u2019t walk close to them, cause they\u2019d see me, identify\nme. So I just kept quite a ways away, and veer off at an angle. I never made any\nsharp turns or quick turns or anything like that, and finally I came to this forest area,\nand I ran across an old deserted \u2014 I don\u2019t know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but\nit was pretty dilapidated. So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all\nwet and stuff like that. So I took off my coveralls, cause I had coveralls with\nsuspenders and stuff, my flight suit. So hung up on the thing in the top of it there,\nand laid down on the straw, and went to bed. And then the next morning, early the\nnext morning, I don\u2019t know, seven \u2014 six, seven o\u2019clock, or what time it was, but I\nheard crack \u2014 like sticks breaking, and stuff like that, and I peek out. Here is a guy\nout there, I thought he was an old man, it looks pre \u2014 he was probably 40 years old,\ncause I was only 19. And so I didn\u2019t know what to do, I had my .45 automatic, pil \u2014\nyou know, shoulder holster and sa \u2014 I says, I don\u2019t know whether to shoot at the\nguy, or make a noise in the \u2014 I had to make a decision real quick here. So I thought\nno, I stuck the gun in the straw, and I stepped out to the door, pulled the \u2014 and\npeeked out to him. And he put his finger up to his mouth like be quiet. And he says\n[indecipherable]. I didn\u2019t know French, but I thought that meant friend or\nApril 26, 2013\nsomething. So he says, shh. So he left. And so about 10 - 15 minutes later, here he\ncome back. Started motioning me to come with him. So I reluctantly went with him.",
        "A: No, I left it in the straw.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to be caught with it because I\u2019d always been told, if you wi \u2014 get\nwith the French underground \u2014 and I| didn\u2019t know who itt was, they didn\u2019t know me\neither, why, if you don\u2019t do exactly what they say, they\u2019Il shoot you. You know,\nbecause they don\u2019t know who you are either. Maybe an infiltrator. So I figure it\u2019s\nbest just to not take the chance, I\u2019Il just leave the gun there. So I left it in the straw\nand went with him, and we walked through the forest quite a ways, maybe a mile it\nseemed like. And came to a house and went to the back hou \u2014 of the house, it was a\nfence \u2014 brick, like brick fence, but half of it was torn down so that when we stepped\nover that, went into the house. And the family \u2014 I took my concentrated\n[indecipherable] my escape kit, and gave it to them. And they made me hot\nchocolate and brought it to me and breakfast in the morning. I stayed there about\nthree days. One time the German came to look \u2014 I \u2014 I guess just watch \u2014 looking for\npeople, and they hid me out in the pigpen out 1n the back. And then they brought me\nback in, I stayed there. And then they brought a \u2014 a couple of \u2014 a guy who had a\nApril 26, 2013\nbicycle and another bicycle for me, and he took me out \u2014 he ga \u2014 he gave me fresh\nclothes to put on. I had a tam, and stuff like that.",
        "A: Three days.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember their names. I wish I did, but I don\u2019t remember their\nnames. They had a \u2014 a young lady there, their daughter I guess it was, that used to\nbring the warm cereal and kind of coffee and \u2014 kind of an ersatz type coffee, I don\u2019t\nknow, it was of str \u2014 strange ta \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, like that. And that was \u2014 I was treated real well there and they \u2014 like I had\na nice bed, and stuff like that. And then, you know, I rode away with this guy, he\ntook me to another house, and that was Madam Marie Duvall(ph). I remember her\nname. And there I met a \u2014 well, a pilot, Jim Fore(ph).\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, he was there. And so, I was really surprised to see him, you know, but I\nguess they were all in the underground group there, you know, and we all lit in a\ncertain area there. Anyway, here I met him, and \u2014",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no. No, you \u2014 you know, they said they were \u2014 and th \u2014 and said,\nwe gotta take out these \u2014 these fighter bases and stuff like that. Cause they told us in\nbriefing, you know, gotta get it done. So, you \u2014 you do what you\u2019re assigned to do.\nSo if you made the decision, make a 360, why, he knew more about it and what \u2014\nwhat was going on than I did, he and the bombardier, so you know, I \u2014",
        "A: Oh, oh yeah, sure. We gave each other a hug, you know. And we stayed there a\nfew days and the lady, Madame Marie Duvall(ph) had a \u2014 there\u2019s a basement, and\nthey had a radio in the basement, and we could listen to BBC. So we got there, we \u2014\nI stayed there, I don\u2019t know, three or four days maybe, I don\u2019t know wa \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t\nremember exactly how many, but then a guy in a two wheel cart, a horse drawn two\nwheel cart came by, and we got in this cart with him, and we rode through a ho \u2014\nlittle \u2014 down a road and then turn a corner, went to a little village, and there was\nGerman tanks there, and soldiers, everything else, and here we were sitting there in\nApril 26, 2013\nGerman \u2014 in French tams and stuff, in civilian clothes, and shaking like a leaf here,\nprobably. But we were just trying to act nonchalant, you know, riding with this guy,\ncause if they\u2019d [indecipherable] he\u2019d have been shot right away too, you know.",
        "A: So, we tried to be as calm as possible, and anyway, he took us to this house, li-\nlike a sa \u2014 let\u2019s see, we were at Madame Marie Duvall\u2019s(ph) house, and then we\nwent from there to a \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know, a man and a lady had a house and they lived\nin there, and there the \u2014 we were supposed to be picked up by someone and taken\nsouth of Paris cause they\u2019d supposedly made arrangements to come in with an A-\n20 and pick us up south of Paris. They\u2019re going to light up a field out there, a hay\nfield or something. And a plane was supposed to come in and pick us up. So they\ntook us to another house, we stayed there a few days, and they \u2014 they had nothing\nbut wine to drink. And I got so thirsty for some water, we went out to the \u2014 where\nthey had a well outside there, and started pulling up the water from the well, and the\nFrench guy come out and said, no, no, no, he said \u2014 I guess he thought it was poison\nor something or not with \u2014 fit to drink, you know. But man, I \u2014 if you\u2019d been\ndrinking just their white wine for a f-few days why your \u2014 get \u2014 get so thirsty for\nreal water, you know? I did, anyway. And so anyways, a guy came by, and you\nprobably heard the name Jacques before. He was a \u2014 I wa \u2014I found out \u2014 we found\nApril 26, 2013\nout later he was a traitor, he was a Belgian F-French guy, and he was getting paid so\nmuch a head for all the people he turned in to the ga \u2014 the Germans. And so we got\nin this car, this Citro\u00e9n \u2014 oh, in the meantime, and \u2014 this house we were at, they\nbrought another kid there, he was a \u2014 from a Wellington bomber, a British kid from\na Wellington bomber. So it was Jim Fore(ph), myself and this guy from the\nWellington bomber. And so they \u2014 we got in the back of this Citro\u00e9n, and the \u2014 the\nguy had a hat too big for him, kind of bug eyed little guy, and \u2014 and he had a\nredheaded woman with him, and a kid maybe 10 - 12 years old in the front seat with\nhim. We drove into Versailles, dropped the girl \u2014 lady off and the little boy off in\nVersailles, and we wer \u2014 thought it was kind of strange, we went through some\nroadblocks just right on through, you slowed down and right on through. We\nthought boy, that\u2019s sort of strange. They told us it wa \u2014 he was a doctor, he could\nget through, you know, real easy cause he had the, I guess I.D. or something. But\nwe were kind of shaken. Anyway, we went \u2014 then he left them there, we went into\nParis. We ended up getting driven right into Gestapo headquarters. So, kind of\nsurprised. So they \u2014 we went \u2014 they had the machine guns all around, and then we\nseparated so \u2014 we walked up these stairs, second floor and down the hall, and the\nother Germans there, they\u2019re standing against the hall like they were afraid of us.\nThey\u2019d stand way back [indecipherable] walking down the hall. And they\nApril 26, 2013\nseparated Jim and I and I don\u2019t know where the prin \u2014 the British kid go \u2014 went\neither, but I know Jim and I were on the same floor up there, but he was 1n another\nroom. And I went into this room, there was a lady and a German guy there, and he\nspoke English, and she was taking \u2014 writing all this stuff down. And so they started,\nyou know, searching us and stuff like that. And I had my wristwatch and \u2014 and \u2014 up\naround my arm, up here. But they took my dog tags, I had them in my shoes and\nthey took everything, just took everything off of us, you know, and \u2014 and put it ina\nsi\u2014 in a\u2014a ba\u2014a bag there, in a big envelope. And I said, can I write my name on\nit or something like that? And he says no need, bury you in two days. But they\ndidn\u2019t put my name on it. And th-the watch I had was not my military watch, it was\nissue watch, but \u2014 cause I had given that to the navigator cause that day he said his\nwatch didn\u2019t work, and so I had mine and I had a gold watch that my mother had\ngiven me for graduating from school, so I wore it. But I had slipped it up here\naround my elbow. Anyway, took everything. So, from then on, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nthey just took us back and finally after that they took us to French prison. You ever\nheard of that? South of Paris? Which \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: No, no \u2014 it was \u2014 1t was not \u2014 not too bad. They ask us questions, they would be\nkind of firm about it, and he had a revolver laying right beside him on his desk. I\nguess that was kind of to be a threat to us or something like that. But I don\u2019t know, I\ndidn\u2019t pay much attention to it, all I gave him was name, rank and serial number.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t til I got over to Fr-French prison, I think it was, that we were \u2014 the\nother interrogation took place that this German officer \u2014 I went into the officer and\nhe shoved this paper out in front of me to sign. And I just shoved it back and I said\nno, I shook my head no. He said no, no, no and started to holler and come out from\nbehind the desk, started kicking at me, and a couple of guards outside the door there\ngrabbed me and put \u2014 I was put in a \u2014 a little box, it was about maybe two or three\nfeet square, metal box, for about 24 hours. And then, the next day, why they took\nme out in the courtyard of \u2014 and lined me up 1n front of the firing squad. They had\nabout five guys there, four or five guys with rifles and za \u2014 the German officers,\ncouple of them there, and they were hollering at me and asking me questions and\nstuff. And I thought I was already dead, so I just, again, I gave them my main \u2014\nname, rank and serial number, and I just stood there and looked at them. Cause I\nthought I was already dead, you know, I just crossed the bridge there for some\nreason and I just \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know why it come over me, I was just totally calm,\nI thought sh \u2014 I\u2019m dead, go ahead and shoot me, you know, didn\u2019t make any\nApril 26, 2013\ndifference. And they just stormed around there for a while, stomping their feet and\nhollering. They had a guy with a British accent, was asking questions. And they\nwanted to know squadron, and all that good stuff. They had all that data, I found out\nlater. But, anyway, they finally gave up and put me back in a cell, and I went ina\ncell for 38 days in solitary, and \u2014",
        "A: Thirty-eight.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t read it, it was in German. So I \u2014 I was always told, you\nknow, they\u2019ll give you papers, try to sign something, everything else. They\u2019ll even\nhave a Red Cross on it, to think sir \u2014 from the Red Cross or something. We were\ntold that by intelligence people, you know, that they had this \u2014 all these things\ngoing, so I just \u2014 but me, I wasn\u2019t going to sign anything. You could have signed\nyour death warrant, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing, you know, or confessions\nor something like that. So I just didn\u2019t sign it, and dil \u2014 I gotta say, he got a little\nupset over that, but \u2014 and put me in solitary and then they would come in \u2014 th-the\nold prison, I don\u2019t know if you know about French prison, they have the ol-old type\ndoors. The doors are about three inches thick, I think, wooden doors, you know, and\nthey had this little trap door up the top, over door that they could open and slide a\nApril 26, 2013\nbowl of soup in to you. And tha \u2014 and that, they had a little peephole, and they had a\n\u2014 one light on the side of this, in the room there, that they could turn on a switch on\nthe outside and light the light, and in the corner you had a little carved out place\nthere in cement, that had a little water spigot, and that was the toilet also there. And\nhad straw on \u2014 on the fl \u2014 you know, a little place for you to sleep. Anyway, I \u2014\nthey\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d come by and flip that light on and that little \u2014 you could hear them\npeeking \u2014 that little thing and peeking at you, you know, every once in a while. So I\ndecided that I didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I took my little soup bowl\nI had, they put in there, and I propped it up on this little shelf in there so it covered\ntheir peek hole. Shouldn\u2019t have done that. Anyway, come along, pe \u2014 turned on the\nlight, I guess, and couldn\u2019t see in. And boy, I heard the awful-est racket you ever\nheard out there. There\u2019s guys running, and you could hear their canisters clanging,\ntheir gas masks things and everything. Pretty soon they opened the door, about two\nor three of them are there, and they come in and started knocking me all around the\nroom, and \u2014 trying to teach me a lesson, you know. And then they left. And I was \u2014\nand I spent my time picking fleas, because they had lice, or fleas in there, and the\nfleas would get in the seams of your clothes, you know, and as a good pastime,\ncause they\u2019d bite you all over, and I was taking \u2014 you could feel along, little hard\nthings and you\u2019d crunch them, you\u2019d break their shells, you know. So that was our\nApril 26, 2013\npastime. And then we\u2019d tap on the wall, cause there were other prisoners there. And\nthere were some points you could tap and you could read the Morse code there. So\nyou knew there were other American prisoners there or something, you know, cause\nthey\u2019d tap back, you know. So just spent your pastime that way. Once I was \u2014",
        "A: Just a \u2014 trying to ask questions. They heard something like they were bombing at\nnight, and you\u2019d hear people screaming, women and men and you heard noises all\nnight long, you hear sh \u2014 gunshots, you don\u2019t know what was going on. And I heard\nlater they were probably torturing people out there, you know, the ai \u2014 they \u2014 cause\nthey had a lot of the French underground people they\u2019d caught also. And once I was\ntaken out to a little courtyard, you had a wa \u2014 a kind of a balcony thing up there,\nwhere the guard kept walking back and forth. And then they had this little area\nthere, and you walk around some, I guess that was your exercise room, you know. It\nwas \u2014 it was penned in, but it was about probably 20 feet square, you could just\nwalk around this little path around the square for exercise. And you could see\ncarvings on the wall where people had been there from the 1800s or something like\nthat. It\u2019s an old, old prison, but all the limestone walls, people scratched their names\nand stuff in it, you know, it was kind of intriguing to see all the people that had\nprobably been there before. Cause it\u2019s an old, old prison, so \u2014 for France. And\nApril 26, 2013\nanyway, finally, when you got, I guess as \u2014 Americans were about, I don\u2019t know,\nwho knows, 12 - 15 miles away, maybe ma \u2014 further, but there was shelling going\non, you could hear it all night long, the cannons and stuff. And then it started\ngetting pretty noisy. And so, all of a sudden the \u2014 they evacuated us, took us out,\ntook us all and put us in those boxcars. And they putting 90 of us in one of those\nboxcars, and we had to stand up. And they put a barrel in the center, cut off half a\nbarrel and that was a toilet and everything, you know, sloshing around there. And so\nthey \u2014 we didn\u2019t know where we were going, you know, we thought we were going\nto be taken out of there to a POW camp, or something, you know, but we ended up\ngoing so far and then we came to a tunnel. And apparently the Americans or\nsomeone [indecipherable] someone had bombed the tunnel shut. And so we were\nin there for quite a few hours, and it got smoky and really bad. And so \u2014 then they\ntook us all \u2014 all these boxcars and made us take the German, I don\u2019t know,\nbackpacks and boxes and things that we carry clothing. And we walk \u2014 followed\nthem down a road and then across a bridge to the other side of this river, up the\nother side, and then we went through a little village and the \u2014 the French people\nwere out there throwing us apples and some food and stuff like that. And the\nGermans were trying to keep them from it, but they\u2019d still throw the stuff, you\nknow, and we\u2019d catch something. And then we got to a train on the other side where\nApril 26, 2013\nthe tunnel had \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 you know, where the tunnel had been closed, we \u2014\nthey had backed a train up at the other side. We boarded that train and went onto \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, but I guess we got to Frankfurt, I think,\nGermany. But before we got there, was going up a hill or something, it\u2019s kind of\nslow, and the tru \u2014 the boxcar right behind us, the \u2014 th-the guys had pried a board\nout of the bottom of the \u2014 I found out later, pried \u2014 and the guys were dropping out\nbetween the railroad tracks. And then, when the train was going up a hill, slowing\ndown, why they\u2019d drop between the tracks and roll out between the wheels to get\nout from under there, because they had these scrapers that would go between it. So\na few of the guys got out. I heard later on \u2014 I don\u2019t know this to be a fact, but I\nheard later on that one guy from Texas, he really escaped. He\u2019s the only guy I ever\nheard of ac-actually got away. So \u2014 but kind of a dangerous thing to do, but you\nknow, was trying to get out of there, and then the \u2014 the one time they \u2014 they \u2014a\nFrench kid in our box car was hanging on one of the vents. On the opposite \u2014\ncattywampus corners of the boxcar they had a vent about maybe eight or 10 inches\nhigh and about two feet long for a vent. They had barbed wire strung across it. And\nthere was this French kid, he\u2019s about 18 years old, I guess, or so \u2014 fif\u2014 14 - 15, I\ndon\u2019t know how old he was. And he had his hand up on this barbed wire, holding\nonto it, cause we were standing up in there. And the German guards on the outside\nApril 26, 2013\nshot him right through the hand. And that\u2019s kind of crazy, you know, he\u2019s already in\nthere. And anyway, then they stopped the car, they took him out. And \u2014 oh, before\nthat, by the way, when these guys dropped out between the railroad tracks, they\nstopped the train, and they took about, I don\u2019t know, it must have been 10 or 15\nguys out there beside the boxcar, lined them up like they were going to shoot them\n\u2014 cause we could look out through the cracks and see them, and they looked like\nthey were going to shoot them, and then this German officer was hollering at them\nand stuff like that. And then we were told that there \u2014 every time \u2014 if anyone tried to\nescape they were going to kill 15 guys for every one that tried to escape. So they\nwere trying to quiet us down, I guess. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. And they took this\nyoung kid out, I was surprised. And I was looking out a crack in that boxcar. The\nGerman officer told him to \u2014 kind of motioned him down there. The tracks were\nraised, kind of sloped on the side, down to \u2014 there\u2019s a f\u2014 some fields down there,\nhave been plowed and stuff. And there\u2019s a little irrigation ditch along the edge of tt.\nI looked down and I thought well, this German officer motioned this kid down\nthere, I thought that he was going to have him go down, wash his hand off, cause it\nwas bleeding and stuff like that. But as soon as he turned around, this German\nofficer shot him right through the back. And the kid laid down and kind of kicked\nlike, and one of the other guards there just raked him with a machine gun. And \u2014\nApril 26, 2013\nand then they took a couple of guys out of the boxcar and gave them shovels and\nmade them go down there by the \u2014 right down close to that little ditch down there,\nand they \u2014 they weren\u2019t there very long. They dug a hole, and I don\u2019t think the thing\nwas two feet deep. Threw this little kid in there and covered him up. And I thought,\nthe mother will never know where that kid is. Cause who knows today \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 what happened to him, you know? Cause I thought boy, how cruel can you be?\nHe\u2019s already in a prison, you know, in the ca \u2014 there, and why\u2019d they shoot him in\nthe hand in the first place? It\u2019s just do \u2014 I think 1t showed \u2014 to try to warn us, don\u2019t\ntry anything. That\u2019s what I assumed, you know? And anyway, we went on and we\nwere kind of shocked, I was anyway. I think all of us were that \u2014 we pulled up in \u2014\non this railroad place in front of this fence, got out. All these stripy clothes prisoners\nin there, and dogs and they herd us into this camp, and it was Buchenwald\nconcentration camp.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know at first, I didn\u2019t even know about the camp, and I thought we were\ngoing to a POW camp. This was my assumption, you know, cause we\u2019d always told\nthey\u2019d take you to Dulag Luft or something, and interrogate you and then take you\nto prisoner of war camp. But we were kind of shocked when we arrived there, cause\nApril 26, 2013\nwe saw, you know, that sign out there on the gate says, wor-wor-work will make\nyou free, in German, and saw the \u2014 all the dogs, and these German guards and\nthere\u2019s skinny prisoners in there, you know, and \u2014 and all the striped clothes. And\nsince we got in there some of the prisoners come up and pretty soon they started\ntelling \u2014 and in English, a few of them spoke English, and \u2014 or it was relayed\nthrough some of the guys that \u2014 we had one guy in our group that spoke \u2014 Ben\nSharf(ph) was a ger \u2014 spoke German real well. And so he said, we\u2019re in\nBuchenwald concentration camp. And then they took us in and stripped all of our\nclothes off of us and put us in a shower-like thing, you know, and we come out, we\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. And then they shaved every hair off of our body\nand then swabbed us with something like creosote that set us on fire, you know, and\nyou ben \u2014 you was dancing around, jumping and si \u2014 cause it was burning, Ju-just\nlike it\u2019s peeling the skin off, you know. And then they brought us down a little fu-\nfurther and they started handing us some clothing. I was given a woman\u2019s silk\nblouse, and a pair of like silk slacks, or women\u2019s slacks or something, real thin\nthings, no shoes, no socks, no nothing. They took everything we had away, our\nother clothes, before we went in the shower. We went in the shower, we thought we\nwere going to the gas chamber or something, you know, cause we\u2019d heard stories\nabout that stuff. But anyway, we were shocked, sort of, that \u2014 and they just finally\nApril 26, 2013\nherd us down to an area and left us there, we were outside on a rock pile. And I\ndon\u2019t know, we were there I don\u2019t know how many days. But at night it was getting\ncold, so we\u2019d all hover around, and cuddle up together, you know, to try to stay\nwari, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, out-outside, and a \u2014 kind of a rock pile area there. And then we \u2014 one day\nwe saw \u2014 we heard this noise, we look up 1n the air and hear a \u2014 about 30,000 feet\nor so up there was a whole bunch of bombers coming over, you know, you could\nsee the contrails behind them. And they were \u2014 looked like they were coming right\nat us. We said, holy mackerel, you know, I hope they\u2019re not going to drop those\nthings on us. And all of a sudden they popped a flair, like a lead bombardier always\npops a flair and they s \u2014 the group tightens their formation, and they make a nice\npattern. So we thought, holy mackerel, here they come. And all of a sudden you\nheard this ru \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 if you ever heard bombs coming down, they fi \u2014 sound like a\nfreight train coming down the track, and there\u2019s a little whistle going on to them,\nand they\u2019re just shredder and rattling like a freight train coming in, you know. And\nall of a sudden \u2014 and they started landing below, and we thought, boy, they\u2019re going\nto get us here. But not one bomb lit inside the \u2014 the fence. They blew part of the \u2014\nthe fence down, but they were bombing the underground factory that \u2014 where all the\nApril 26, 2013\nwor \u2014 the slave labor was used. And that was a V-2, V-2, gyros and factories for\nammunition and stuff like that there. So we were relieved and \u2014 you know, they\ndidn\u2019t drop it on us. But they \u2014 apparently they went down the SS barracks, took out\nabout 2,000 SS guys and \u2014 and gutted the whole place with \u2014 they first went in with\nexplosives and then they dropped incendiaries after that. Then they dropped leaflets.\nI saw one of the leaflets, but they started shooting at people that picked up the\nleaflets, so there were \u2014 but there were still a few prisoners got ahold of leaflets. I\nsaw one of them later. It showed a picture of a B-17 and a silhouette of a B-29,\nshowed how much bigger the B-29 was and that we warned the Germans that they\nwere going to start using these planes on them if they don\u2019t surrender, and stuff like\nthat, you know, and \u2014 and it showed how Americans treat German prisoners of war,\nand stuff, 1t showed them in mess halls and stuff like that. And they \u2014 and then had\na thing and they were trying to invite the pr \u2014 us prisoners to join them and fight\nagainst the Russians. And they give us extra benefits or something. You know, this\nkind of crazy thing.",
        "A: They tried to \u2014 they come up and ask us what our profession was, what we could\ndo and stuff like that, and all of said we were students. We already had agreed to\nthis before, we were going to say they were all students. And so we \u2014 we held by\nApril 26, 2013\nthat, and they \u2014 it made them pretty mad that we didn\u2019t tell them we had any\nprofessions other than just students and fliers. So we \u2014 none of us worked, we all\nrefused to work. So \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that was a good idea or not, but we weren\u2019t \u2014\ndidn\u2019t seem be punished any more for it, you know. And they finally \u2014 we were\nliving outside, like I say, on the rocks out there. And one day \u2014 and there were a lot\nof these little Gypsy kids, you\u2019ve heard about them probably. I don\u2019t know how\nmany, there were hundreds of them around there. And you had to watch, because if\nyou had any food left at all, you have some, once in a while, about once a week, you\nget about three little \u2014 real small, little baked potatoes, half rotten, but they\u2019d been\nboiled, you know. It was better than nothing. And if one of \u2014 if you had piece of\nthose left, they\u2019d steal it, those poor little Gypsy kids that were running around, they\nwere hungry, you know, and they steal anything that wasn\u2019t tied down. And they\nwere in a barracks there, and one day, it seemed like to me, they all disappeared.\nAnd they come down and got us and gave us that barracks. And I used to think, oh\nmy, what\u2019d they do, did they kill them all? They [indecipherable] their camp, what\nhappened to them? I still to this day don\u2019t know really what all happened to those\npoor little kids. But they were little \u2014 you know, from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,\nall the eastern countries that they picked them up, their parents were probably\nkilled, and they brought them in there. But that was \u2014 that\u2019s been kind of a\nApril 26, 2013\ndisturbing thing all my life, the \u2014 what happened to those poor little kids, you know.\nBut we wer \u2014 we got the barracks and \u2014 and we were fortunate to get those, you\nknow, and then we were there I don\u2019t know how long and we got a bowl of grass\nsoup every day, you know, and three \u2014 we got about three little potatoes once a\nweek or so, and \u2014 and then they brought in some \u2014 a barrel one time of la \u2014 like\nlittle sardines, they were just in saltwater, they were raw things, you know, dead,\nbut \u2014 and were in saltwater, real heavy brine saltwater. And of course we ate those\nthings like crazy. And w-we associated with all the other prisoners. There was a \u2014\nright near \u2014 across from our barracks was a Polish barracks, and one day there was a\nbig scuffle over there, you saw a whole bunch of them piling on some guy, and you\nwonder what happened. Well, later on I fou \u2014 h-heard that this one Polish guy had\nbeen at another camp, and apparently he had been a snitch or something like that.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup\nout of one of the guy\u2019s hands. So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket\nover his head and slugged him to death. It was just, you know, dog eat dog type\nattitude. And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of kapos, they were called\nkapos. These were German prisoners, but they had given them special rations to be\n\u2014 and they were all big guys, and they\u2019d give them a big board or a club, like a\nbaseball bat, and they were to keep us other prisoners 1n line, to obey orders you\nApril 26, 2013\nknow. Line up, do this, to go here. So everybody tried to stay away from those\nkapos. And so \u2014 but I used to talk to some of the Polish guys over there spoke\nEnglish, and you \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of the esso \u2014 SOE guys, they\nwere British and \u2014 and some of them were Scottish, most of them British. But they\nwere secret type guys, operations guys that were dropped behind the German lines\nto do sabotage and stuff. And they were about \u2014 oh, there must have been 30 or so\nof them in there, 35 or 40. And one day they took \u2014 took \u2014 I heard \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nhow many, but th \u2014 17 of them went into Weimar, and I guess were tried, they\nbrought them back and killed them. And later on they killed all the other guys. But I\nused to talk to some of those guys, and I found out two of them were from\nScotland, they were twins, and one had had a scar up in his shoulder, and they put a\nscar on the other one\u2019s shoulder just like it. And they had \u2014 one would be up in\nBremen, up in northern Germany, another would be down in Munich and\nsomething would happen, a big explosion or something would happen, they\u2019d catch\nthis guy and \u2014 cause he was there, and he had the evidence, because you know, he\u2019d\nbe \u2014 be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here. I\nwasn\u2019t there. And here that they \u2014 they finally coupled the fact together that this \u2014\nthey were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both. And later on they were\nboth killed. They killed all those SOE guys, the British guys. And the Russian guys\nApril 26, 2013\n\u2014I used to talk to some of the Russians, they\u2019d speak a little bit of English, and one\nof them used to tell me all the time that America would never survive because we\nproduced so many airplanes and stuff like that, and we would financially and\neverything, fold after the war, that we couldn\u2019t stand all that production, and stuff\nlike that. A few little conversations like that we had with the Russians, you know,\nthat did speak some English. And they \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen the\n[indecipherable] but I didn\u2019t know til after the war that they had a building up\nthere, the Russians, a lot of them disappeared. They would take them up there and\nthere was a like a\u2014 a medical examination. They\u2019d stand them on some scales, and\nthey had a hole right behind the scales, there in the wall, and a gun back there, and\nthey\u2019d turn around like that, and shoot them right through the back of the head. And\nthey eliminated a whole bunch of Russians that way by \u2014 by make \u2014 make them\nthink they were giving them a medical, they were standing on the scale, then bam,\nthey\u2019re gone. And the crematorium there was \u2014 I\u2019ve been there a few times after the\nwar, after I been out of there, and they still have the hooks on the wall where they\nused to hang the prisoners, and they would cut them, their legs and bodies, and\nbleed \u2014 let the blood drain out of them into the drain, because then they would burn\nthem in the crematorium upstairs, and they had these little trollies that they\u2019d lay\nthem on and wheel them up there, and then wheel them into these chambers up\nApril 26, 2013\nthere, had about, I don\u2019t know, eight or 10 of these cremation chambers up there,\nwheel them in there and cremate them. Cause they had bodies stacked by the\ncrematorium all day long. The \u2014 used to see so much inhumanity to man, that you\ncouldn\u2019t understand. You\u2019re already a prisoner, and you\u2019d be sta \u2014 we\u2019d stand up\nthere \u2014 we counted \u2014 they called it appel. My number was 78,336, but \u2014 and we\nweren\u2019t tattooed, and we used to ask the kapos, the fa \u2014 the kapos told us that we\nwere not tattooed because we were trading material. I guess \u2014 we \u2014 we assumed that\nthat was going to be trading for German prisoners, you know, that we\u2019re \u2014 we\ncaptured or something. We didn\u2019t \u2014 and know \u2014 don\u2019t really know to this day what\nit was all about, why we weren\u2019t tattooed. But there were about \u2014 later on I found\nthere were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know\n[indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi \u2014 learned\nafter the war that \u2014 from the archives at Buchenwald that the diet was designed to\nstarve you to death in about three months. Keep cycling prisoners through there,\ncause they needed ru \u2014 labor, slave labor to work in the pri \u2014 in the factories and\nstuff, you know? So that was one way of just getting rid of them, starve them to\ndeath, rather than shoot them, or some go to \u2014 took energy and took people. I\u2019ve\nheard all sorts of rumors, I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard that the \u2014\nthey used to lie in the \u2014 you\u2019ve seen where the pictures of the Jewish people lined\nApril 26, 2013\nup by ga \u2014 by these pits and they\u2019d shoot them and drop in the pits and they\u2019d cover\nthem up. But the people that had to mow them down, those people had mental\nproblems because they didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, they were killing other humans. So that\u2019s\nwhy the gas chambers came into being, so much. That was to \u2014 cause it wasn\u2019t such\na personal thing. So \u2014 but it\u2019s [indecipherable] because when we stand up for\nappel to be counted, these SS guys would stand up there, they count your heads,\nand they had to have the count right in camp before they would excuse you, go back\nto the barracks, or where you\u2019re gonna go. Sometimes it\u2019d take three hours, and it \u2014\nguys \u2014 some of the guys were \u2014 I weighed 82 pounds when I got out of there, s-\nsome of the guys were skinnier than I was, couldn\u2019t stand up. And you\u2019d try to help\nthem stand up, and the SS guys would wade in there and knock his brains out with a\nrifle butt, and make the prisoners put him on a gunny sack, four of them carry him\nover and stack him by the bodies by the crematorium now. So it\u2019s just \u2014 and there\nwas these two wheel carts running around all day, picking up bodies and hauling\nthem to the crematorium. So it was just not a very good environment. And you just\nwonder \u2014 I used to wonder about how can people be so cruel, and just \u2014 you\u2019re\nalready prisoners, you know, why make it even worse? But we had a guy whose\nname the ger \u2014 the German SS guy up there was named Hauptman. And he would\nstand up there when we were out there, and ge \u2014 weather got kind of cool, and he\nApril 26, 2013\nhad a little bucket, and he had a little cup in it, and he\u2019d say \u2014 he\u2019d pull back his\nuniform, show he had woolen underwear underneath. And he\u2019d say, cold, cold? And\nthen he\u2019d throw \u2014 take a s-scoop up a bucket of this water \u2014 a scoop of this water\nand throw it out over us, you know, like spray us, you know, with a little bit of\nwater. He\u2019d say cold? He just kind of tormented, you know. I don\u2019t know what he\ndid it for, but it \u2014 how \u2014 I don\u2019t know how people get some enjoyment out of that.\nAnyway, that was my feeling. And one day the Americans came over and bombed\nthe \u2014 when we were outside, I was telling you before, living outside on the rocks\nwere \u2014 after that bombing, why, we were asked, will you come down and guide us?\nThey said, if you were soldiers, you have the discipline to help us with the\nwounded. And they had a guy in there, I don\u2019t know h \u2014 the \u2014 he spoke a British\naccent, like he was \u2014 be-been trained in England or something, and he would talk\nto us, you know, he was the guy that they used for communication to us. And then\nthe \u2014 they had another guy in there named \u2014 he was a Dutchman from du \u2014\nHolland, he spoke good English and he spoke German also. So they\u2019d\ncommunicate through him, and he gave us lots of information. But anyway, they\ncome down and got us, they says, you will help us with the wounded people in the\nbombing. Took us up there, and I didn\u2019t help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was\nrunning through this fire and nails and stuff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was\nApril 26, 2013\ngoing as slow as I could. And I saw a wooden \u2014 wooden shoe laying over there, and\nso I kneeled down and put that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German\nguards over there picked up some board and started beating me across the back, and\nyou know, knocked the wind out of me. It seemed like I climbed \u2014 I crawled about a\nmile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed like a mile, and just got \u2014 almost\nknocked me out, cause I couldn\u2019t hardly breathe, you know, knocked the wind out\nof me. And I didn\u2019t help anybody. I just act like I was help \u2014 trying to help some,\nput out the fire, something like that. I just went around, but I didn\u2019t do a darn thing,\nbut no one bothered me after that. Finally, I went back to my building I was in, but I\nsure didn\u2019t help anybody. Some of the guys, I guess, had to help somebody, you\nknow, I didn\u2019t. But anyway, when the Luftwaffe guy came through to look \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014\nI guess he was going to say, look at the bomb damage, he told the \u2014 the other SS\nguys that. And he came in. Well, we had a guy, Ben Sharf(ph) from New Prague,\nMinnesota, he was our waist gunner. He spoke German from his ancestor was\nGerman. And so we said, Ben, you gotta go up, talk to the guy. Tell him we should\nbe in a POW camp. So Jim Fore(ph) and I went up with him, close to him, and he s\n\u2014we told him salute the guy, so he\u2019s \u2014 Ben saluted him, and this German off \u2014\nLuftwaffe officer, he kind of gives a real, slow salute. He didn\u2019t know what to do, I\nthink, cause real slow he kind of went like this, real slow, put his hand down. And\nApril 26, 2013\nthey talked a few minutes, and then the SS tried to break it up, and he pulled his\nrank on them and told them to stand back, and so he talked about five minutes to\nBen, and he told Ben that they didn\u2019t work very good with the Gestapo and the SS,\nbut he\u2019d do what he could, but we should be in a POW camp, he agreed. And we\nthought, well, that\u2019s encouraging news, but \u2014 and he left. And it was, I don\u2019t know,\na month later, when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came\ninto camp, round us up, took us and put into only about 30 - 40 in a boxcar and took\nus to Stalag Luft II over \u2014 over \u2014 over on the Polish border. So, man, and we got\nfood, we got shoes, we got clothes. It was \u2014 it was like being in the Waldorf\nAstoria, you know. But it was really \u2014 really grateful th-that he came about. Now, I\njust found out recently that there\u2019s a book called, \u201cA Higher Call.\u201d And I had heard\nabout a B-17 that had been shot down, riddled pretty badly, and it was down, oh\n3,000 feet or so, and they\u2019d been throwing the radios out and the \u2014 the parachutes\nand everything to lighten plane, they\u2019d get back to England. Well, this \u2014 this\nGerman fighter flew right down beside him, wingtip to wingtip, and tried to motion,\nand \u2014 they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t communicate, but th-the pilot was Brown, Lieutenant\nBrown flying that B-17, trying to get back to England, and this German fighter\npilot was trying to make a motion for him to go to England \u2014 I mean, go to fr \u2014 to\nSweden, closer, across the Channel. And this book is called, \u201cA Higher Call.\u201d\nApril 26, 2013\nNow, this German fighter pilot was a Catholic guy, and he had even some other\nfighter pilots with him, had gone to Goering and tried to resign and knock off some\nof the stuff they was doing, but they almost got shot over it. And this book is called,\n\u201cA Higher Call,\u201d and it\u2019s just recently come out. It\u2019s in English. I got a copy of it\njust this \u2014 this last month. It\u2019s quite intriguing to read, but this guy is the same guy\nthat came into our camp, that got us out of there, and he got us out of there three\ndays before the record \u2014 the record showing Buchenwald whatever, that we \u2014 we\nwere supposed to be eliminated three days \u2014 and he got us out three days before we\nwere supposed to all been killed. The orders had come down from Berlin. And this\nwas just recently because this guy, Mike Dorsey, his father \u2014 his grandfather was in\nBuchenwald with us, his name was Easy(ph) Freeman(ph). And his grandfather\nstarted talking about it in recent years, I guess, and so Mike Dorsey was a movie\nproducer, he decided to look into it, and he went back to Germany for almost a\nyear research, and then went to all the archives in Buchenwald and everything. And\nhe made this movie called, \u201cThe Lost Airman of Buchenwald,\u201d cause we had\nbeen lost because they didn\u2019t know where we were. We weren\u2019t in a POW camp\nuntil after the war they found where we were. So, that\u2019s the reason that movie is\nnamed that, but I\u2019m glad that he \u2014 his grandfather finally started talking about it,\nand he made this movie, and \u2014 and he \u2014 he even got \u2014 I was surprised, but when he\nApril 26, 2013\nwent back to Buchenwald, looked at all the records, he brought me back my arrest\nrecord, my Gestapo arrest picture, and the record of it. Shows USA, and then has it\ncrossed out, and I think it says [indecipherable] or something up there on it.",
        "A: Oh yes, always.",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we all decided the highest ranking officer would be in charge. And\nthat happened to be a New Zealander, the only New Zealander there, but he was a \u2014\na squadron leader, and so we all agreed our \u2014 our highest ranking officer of\nAmericans agreed, we all agreed we would do whatever he said, and we\u2019d act as a\nmilitary unit. And a lot of times even we go to the latrine, that open latrine down\nthere, we\u2019d form up and march like we were soldiers. The SS guys just \u2014 we threw\nthem in fits almost when we do that, because we were acting military, you know,\nlike a unified unit. They didn\u2019t like that. So, yeah, we tried to act as military as\npossible. We\u2019d sing songs you know, and stuff like that, and just to \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nI guess to keep our spirits up. May have tormented them too, but I think it was\nprimarily for our own si \u2014 you know, our own spirits. And we all \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nApril 26, 2013\nand we also when we were there, we all agreed that if we ever got out of there, we\nwould \u2014 we formed a club called the KLB pre-lager Buchenwald. And we would\nall meet every year somewhere, and all of us would attend these meetings. We did\nfor many years. We met in England, we met in the United States, we met all over\nthe places. But all of us guys would get together and it was \u2014 it was just a\ncamaraderie that you develop, you know, by being in these situations. So \u2014",
        "A: No, no. I only saw guys get s \u2014 knocked around a little bit. A couple of guys got\npneumonia and died, you know. That was L.C. Beck(ph). He was from\n[indecipherable] Park, California. And Jim Fore(ph) and I, after we got back in\nservice, went to see his parents and tell them, cause they never had any ar \u2014 he \u2014 he\nri \u2014 had written some notes when he was with the French underground, and it\u2019s\ncalled, I think \u201cFighter Pilot.\u201d And he wrote this little book. And his parents we \u2014\nall this information was given to his parents, and they p-printed this little book.\nAnyway, we went to see his parents and tell them how his last days were in\nBuchenwald, and he died of pneumonia. So, other than that I saw no actual \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t see everything, but I \u2014 I just saw no one get ki-killed by the Germans. So \u2014\nApril 26, 2013",
        "A: Yes, I think because we had been caught in civilian clothes, with the French\nunderground, and we \u2014 even though they knew who we were, cause they even\nshowed us some pictures of our squad, and showed our \u2014 they had the names of our\nsquad and they had a lot of information on us. And we had dog tags, you know.\nThey knew who we were, but the excuse was, we were caught with \u2014 we were\nsaboteurs and terrorists cause were were caught in civilian clothes with the French\nunderground, so we were sent to Buchenwald. That\u2019s the way I assume it\nhappened. I have no other \u2014 no other reason, you know, that I can think of.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Kind of shock. We were herded out of the train, you know. Herded in there like I\ntold you, and pretty soon we were herded in there, and took our clothes off, put us\nin the shower and shaved our heads and bodies and swabbed us and gave us some\nprison clothes, and that was it. We were just in total shock, really, you know, we\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on. The other prisoners, some of the prisoners, and\nApril 26, 2013\nthrough, like I say, Ben Sharf(ph), and \u2014 and Dutch, we found out that the other\nprisoners say the only way you'll ever leave this place is up the pipe, and that was\nthe crematortum chimney there, you know. So we were constantly told that, you\nknow, the only way out 1s up the pipe. So we\u2019d all kind of resigned ourselves to\nthat, more or less, you know, and hoping we\u2019d get out and hoping the allies would,\nyou know, get us before the \u2014 we got up the pipe.",
        "A: So it was just \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how we even kept our spirits up, but\nwe \u2014 we were doing ra \u2014 pretty good. We\u2019d talk a lot and we\u2019d laugh \u2014 sit in \u2014 this\nforming of the KLB club was part of \u2014 we\u2019d have discussions where we were going\nto meet, how we were going to do it, how the organization was going to be and\neverything. So it was \u2014 we \u2014 it was all planned in Buchenwald. And we had a little\nbadge, we drew up a sig \u2014 insignia that we all had, and so it was a \u2014 it was just \u2014 I\nthink it was to keep us busy, but also the camaraderie, you know, that we\u2019d have if\nwe ever got out of there. So \u2014 and I-I don\u2019t know how, some of the guys who got on\nthe march, like I said, some of the guys that we \u2014 when we marched from Stalag\nLuft Il, we got there on that march, some of the guys just gave up. We saw one\nguy, and he went running, cli \u2014 tried to climb the electric fence, you know, some\nguys gave up. I have a \u2014 a strange attitude of life. I always believed in a higher\nApril 26, 2013\npower like the lord Jesus Christ as a savior, and I, as a kid I went to mi \u2014 I\u2019ve got\nrecords showing I went to Sunday school, never missing a \u2014 a Sunday for four\nyears, five years, you know. And \u2014 and when I was put up in front of the firing\nsquad, all I\u2014 my cares all went away, I just flat lined, and I, from that day forward,\nI don\u2019t get excited, I don\u2019t get upset, I don\u2019t get mad, I don\u2019t worry. And when I\nused to work in the engineering stuff, why we\u2019d be on government proposals. We\nhad three guys in my department die of heart attacks in one year, and they issued\nstress cards that you hold and they turn color if you start getting stressed, and the\ndirector\u2019d hold a meeting, and pretty soon you seen him take his little card out of\nhis pocket, lay it down on the table, and I knew he was getting stressed. And after\nthe meeting, guys used to come up to me, cause they\u2019d be hollering, deadlines and\nwhy don\u2019t you do this, why don\u2019t you do that. And they\u2019d come up to me and say,\nlet\u2019s see your card. Show them mine, it was normal. They\u2019d say, what the hell is\nwrong with you, don\u2019t you have any nerves? I said yeah. I says, if this is a problem,\nfix it. If you can\u2019t fix it, what\u2019s the problem?",
        "A: Kind of strange attitude, but I just \u2014 I just got that, like I say, after that firing\nsquad, I just can\u2019t bring myself to worry. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019d \u2014 hate is a terrible thing too. I\nsee people hate, and I see what hate does, like the Germans hated the Jewish people,\nApril 26, 2013\nand the other people, and I \u2014 I just \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t even hate the Germans, I feel sorry\nfor them. Cause even the SS guys, you know, I don\u2019t agree with it, I don\u2019t like it\nand everything, but I can\u2019t \u2014 I just can\u2019t bring myself to hate. I-I\u2019m a strange duck, I\nguess, but I \u2014 I can\u2019t.",
        "A: Let\u2019s see, I think we were only there maybe three months or so.",
        "A: Oh I \u2014 yeah, I gained some weight back, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much I weighed,\nbut I gained some, and I had my \u2014 I had a wound in my lower leg when I bailed out,\nI don\u2019t know if it was from shrapnel, hooked on some [indecipherable] torn metal\nor what, but I had a pretty good gash just about to the bone, right about halfway up\nmy lower leg, and when I hit the ground, why I turned my ankle, I guess it was kind\nof sore or something, hurt [indecipherable]. And when I was in Buchenwald it\nturned into gangrene, like. It was all numb and just \u2014 couldn\u2019t have any feeling, it\nfelt like just you \u2014 you know how your leg \u2014 how something goes to sleep when\nyou\u2019re [indecipherable] that\u2019s the way it felt. I could hardly feel I was walking on\nit, you know, it was just kind of bad. So when I got to Stalag Luft III, why, they \u2014\nthey tried to put sulfur drugs and stuff on it and nothing would touch it, so then they\nput me in the prison hospital. And the German doctor there wanted to amputate my\nApril 26, 2013\nleg right above the knee. And I \u2014 Captain Daniels, he was \u2014 we had Major jone \u2014\nDavy Jones, and Captain Daniels, who were on the Doolittle raids in Tokyo unit.\nAnd they ended up in Europe and being shot down, and they were in our \u2014 south\ncompound of the da \u2014 Stalag Luft III. Anyway, Captain Daniels there in the\nhospital and I said, no, no, no, I\u2014 you know, listen, I don\u2019t want my leg cut off. And\nso they talked to the German guy, Captain Daniels, and they decided, well, the only\nsolution was to try to save would be to \u2014 they made kind of a tray, a curved tray\nthey laid down on my leg, and they wrapped my leg with gauze about \u2014 looked like\nabout two inches thick, and they hung it up at about a 20 - 30 degree angle, and they\nput a\u2014a-\u2014a metal bucket up there, hung it up there with a nail hole in it, dripping\nsaltwater on it. And they dripped it on my toe, and it just run down the thing. I don\u2019t\nknow if it was a month or something, it dripped \u2014 just dripped every day, it was just\n\u2014 it was miserable, just laying there, but you know \u2014 anyway it was a long time, I\ndon\u2019t know how long it was, but that thing got \u2014 the whole thing got just like a big\nrock cast, cause all that salt and then it\u2019d evaporate, you know. And they come in\none day and they said, well, we\u2019re gonna cut it off, see what we got. So they cut that\n\u2014all that gauze and stuff off of there, and it was just a \u20141f you\u2019ve ever seen a\nparched earth, it\u2019s just cracks and stuff and brown, and rotten looking thing. And\nthen they squeezed it with this gauze and stuff, and the pus is squirt out around my\nApril 26, 2013\nankle, and it volcanoes up around my knee and stuff like that, and they\u2019d squeeze it\nand milk it a little bit. And it stunk like crazy. So he looked at it, and they sh \u2014 they\nkind of shook their heads, and they said, well, it\u2019s doing something, so they\nwrapped it up again, put the saltwater up there again and kept dripping it on there,\nand I don\u2019t know, seemed like a month, I don\u2019t know how long it was, really. And it\ngot all hard again, they took it off, and it was starting to grow skin back. So they\nkept wrap \u2014 wrapping in gauze, and stuff like that, and they we \u2014 and they finally\nsent me back to the \u2014 my barracks back at the saw \u2014 compound, and I was there and\nI was \u2014 it was hard to walk on, but it was \u2014 I was limping around, and it was getting\na little better all the time. And they would \u2014 I \u2014 I forget how often the \u2014 but they\nwould rewrap it. I don\u2019t remember, my mind 1s gone, I guess, on how often, but\nevery once in a while they\u2019d \u2014 every couple of days, why they\u2019d rewrap the leg, and\nI'd walk on it. It hurt, but I walked on it, and then I was in \u2014 I was \u2014 guess I was in\nthe theater one night there when all of a sudden they come in and said, we\u2019re \u2014\nwe're gonna leave the camp. Cause we\u2019d seen all the low flying airplanes and stuff\ngoing, you know, to-towards the Russian front over there, and we\u2019d heard a lot of\nrumors about it in camps, what\u2019s going on. And so Colonel Clark, he was a colonel\nmajor \u2014 he was General Clark at Colorado Springs there, the air \u2014 air academy\nthere later on, but he was a colonel in our camp there at south compound. Major\nApril 26, 2013\nDavy Jones and Captain Daniels and Colonel Clark. Anyway, Colonel Clark\nasked me, he says, that we\u2019re gonna go on this march [indecipherable] we\u2019re\ngonna leave. There\u2019s about three foot of snow on the ground, and Colonel Cl \u2014\nColonel Clark asked me, he says, you want to stay here, and be liber \u2014 or be \u2014 we \u2014\nget liberated by the Russians? Or do you want to go with the masses, it\u2019s your\nchoice. So I says, Pll go with the masses of people, and maybe the cold and the\nwalking, the circulation will help. He says, you think you can make it? I says, well,\nI\u2019m gonna try. So I went on the march, I was limping and it hurt, but every day\nseemed to be a little bit better, cause I think the circulation and the cold \u2014 it wasn\u2019t\ngonna re-infect, I don\u2019t think, with the cold, you know. And I think the circulation\nwas helped by just walking on it, just constantly walking, cause we walked a long\ntime. And finally got better. I was still limping when I got home, but \u2014",
        "A: It seemed like a month, but I \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how many days we \u2014 and I\nknow the first time we marched, what \u2014 60 \u2014 I think we marched about 65 miles or\nsomething, I had heard, I don\u2019t know how miles it was, but it was \u2014 seemed like a\ncouple days. We stopped at, I think a brick factory, or something like that. Once \u2014 I\nstopped at a barn once with hay, and that were \u2014 was pretty nice. And two or three\ntimes on that trip we stopped at places that we got warm, and they gave us some\nApril 26, 2013\nsoup. And I don\u2019t really remember how many days it was. I\u2019m sure other people\nknow what \u2014 how many days that was on the trip, but \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] evacuate from the Russian front, cause the Russians were\ncoming, they were close by apparently, and they wanted to get us away from the\nRussians.",
        "A: Well, you don\u2019t want the Russians to get ahold of us, they wanted to just keep us\nas prisoners, cause we were material that they could trade, or hold hostage, or\nsomething like that, you know. We just assumed that we were hostages to be held,\nand the more of us that they could keep, the \u2014 the better. And getting us away from\nthe fronts, you know, and we ended up down at Moosburg, which was pretty\ncrowded, had lots of prisoners there, you know. And then we heard rumors about\nthe allies not too far away, and they \u2014 they had radio there too, you know, their\nsecret radios, they had crystal sets. And I heard \u2014 we were told that \u2014 that if they\ntried to evacuate us from Moosburg to be \u2014 light a building on fire or something,\ncause they\u2019d have planes circling. And we noticed that at about 35,000 feet or\nsomething, way up in the sky, we\u2019d hear these airplanes, and once in a great while\nyou could see one of them, but they\u2019re \u2014 just barely see them. And they were \u2014\nApril 26, 2013\ncircled day and night, and they said, light a building on fire, something, if anything\n\u2014 they started to kill anybody or anything like that, and they would make an\nimmediate attack on the camp. And we were shocked one day was \u2014 I was down by\nthe gate cause there was a lot of commotion and stuff and the Germans were\ncoming by, and there are tanks rolling by and everything else, and I think Captain\nhe \u2014 and Captain Daniels was down there close to me too, and the German guards\nall of a sudden were running to a \u2014 one the buildings, their \u2014 their little guard shack\nthere. And \u2014 and then we saw what was happening, the SS guy there, there was tank\npeople out there, were telling the \u2014 motioning them to come out and help fight, I\nguess, cause we were right down there by the gate watching them, and all of a\nsudden one of these Germans put a Panzer fist, a German anti-tank gun right into\nthose \u2014 his own guys, those Luftwaffe guys at the \u2014 at the gate in the building there,\njust blew it wide open. Holy mackerel, you know, what\u2019s going on, cause all hell\nwas breaking loose, you know. You hear gunfire and cannon fire and everything\nelse, and the Americans were shelling pretty high with large cannons, because you\ncould look up to Moosburg and see the tar sliding off the roofs of the houses and\nstuff. So, was pretty noisy for a while, and all of a sudden the American tanks\nstarted coming by and we saw the goings on, and \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t five minutes\nbehind the front lines, here come Patton, riding in a Jeep. It\u2019s ju \u2014 standing up in\nApril 26, 2013\nhis Jeep, and he motioned they \u2014 he motioned a tank or something, break down the\nfence, he come driving right inside the camp and stood up in his Jeep, and told\neverybody, you know, to be quiet or something. He gave a little talk and told us not\nto go into town, and stuff like that. And I was shocked to see him there, I was \u2014 you\nknow, just dumbfounded. Here he had his pearl handled revolvers on, that you\nknow, like, what was it \u2014 what\u2019s her name, some, you know, singer had given him,\nyou know. And I-I was shocked, cause he wasn\u2019t five minutes for find the \u2014 behind\nthe front lines. So we just stayed in camp and then they let us out, and I went up to\nwhere the Americans had put a pontoon bridge across the river up there, right in\ntown, 1n the south side of town. And I went up there one time, and the \u2014 the \u2014 I was\namazed that the engineers were out there putting a bridge back across the river; it\nhad been cut loose. They were trying to get tanks across the river, and the Germans\nwere up higher, shelling that down there to the river, and they cut the bri \u2014 their\npontoon bridge loose one time, and it floated kind of down the river, and they had\nthese little boats out there, outboard [indecipherable] towing that thing back up and\ncon \u2014 reconnected. And shells were, you know, dropping in the water down in \u2014\nabove them there. I was shocked, I \u2014 now I realized, you know, I\u2019d be running and\nhiding, rather than being there, but you could see it, the splash of the water and\nstuff, from where we were. And I remember seeing that \u2014 that German flag come\nApril 26, 2013\noff that steeple up there in Moosburg, and the American flag go up. What a \u2014 what\na feeling. You can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s just \u2014",
        "A: It was a few days, because I know they brought 1n the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 you know,\nthere\u2019s tanks, there are armored cars and stuff, and I got r\u2014 and they brought in a\nsoup kitchen from their military guys at the front lines, and they had some \u2014 some\nsoup, bean soup with corned beef in it. And I got a couple of bowls of that, and I ate\nit. Should never have done it, because I got so sick, I \u2014 I \u2014 I-I was wishing someone\nwould shoot me in the head, cause I never been so sick in my life. I laid there in\nbed, in that bunk for I don\u2019t know how long. But I don\u2019t know how long \u2014 how\nmany days I was there, but I \u2014 I-I \u2014 I\u2019ve never been so sick in my life.

        "A: Oh yeah, cause we had been, you know \u2014 bad re \u2014 not very much rations and\nstuff like that, and yeah, it was just too rich. And immediately when the \u2014 and\nfinally the medics came in and cut us off all that stuff, you know. And I was so sick\nI didn\u2019t go to \u2014 a lot of the guys were \u2014 when we went to Spremberg and they flew\nus out of Spremberg, that was a \u2014 an air force \u2014 German air force base not far\naway, why I \u2014I didn\u2019t go to spr \u2014 sprem \u2014 to |\u2014 Camp Lucky Strike, I was taken to\nApril 26, 2013\nLi\u00e9ge, Belgium, to a medical hospital up there.

        "A: Yeah, I went straight home to my parents\u2019 house.",
        "A: Can\u2019t explain it. Just being home, you know, it\u2019s a great thing. And seeing the\nfamily, and then the \u2014 I stayed in the \u2014 I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t discharged yet, but I was\nable to stay home, and I worked with GCA \u2014 Ground Approach Systems, cause\nGilfillan was building radars and stuff for ground approaches, training, and I was\nApril 26, 2013\nstill in the military, so I went to Mines Field which is LA International Airport, but\nthe military side of it, and I\u2014 we\u2019d go there every day and worked to put radios in\nplanes and tune them up and stuff like that, cause the pilots were practicing landing\nwith that new radar Gilfillan built. So I worked there for, I don\u2019t know, a couple of\nmonths. At first I was assigned \u2014 I ga \u2014 got to go home, and then I was at \u2014 at \u2014 got\nto what was it, Santa Monica, at a hotel out there, and then \u2014 but I wasn\u2019t required\nto stay there, I had a home tel \u2014 hotel room, but they said I could live at home if I\nwanted to, so I just lived at home with my parents. And I\u2019d drive out to ma-march \u2014\nMines Field every day at LA International Airport, and so I don\u2019t know how long\nI worked there until I got out of the service, and sent to San Bernardino, and I was\ndischarged from there. But in the meantime I\u2019d read in the paper and the magazines\nabout television and some stuff, and Dr. se \u2014 de \u2014 Lee De Forest, who invented the\nvacuum tube and Sanabria, his cohort had formed an engineering, electrical\nengineering and TV school in \u2014 on \u2014 in Hollywood. And so I got ahold of them and\nwanted to know if I could go to school there and get a degree in electrical\nengineering and learn TV and stuff like that, and so I signed up for it. So I went to s\n\u2014I was in school three days after I got discharged out of San Bernardino. So I\nwent right to school, and got out of there \u2014 went there f\u2014 about three years and got\nout, and the first thing I did was \u2014 cause TV was just coming on the market, I went\nApril 26, 2013\nin the TV business. I went to work for a guy that was \u2014 bought a TV, and then went\nin it myself. And RCA was advertising they were gonna make a \u2014 a projection tube,\nfive inch projection tube. And they\u2019d had a little 10 inch table model TV. And\nBausch and Lomb was talking about a lens for this RCA thing. So I was\ninquisitive, I called them up and asked RCA if I could get is \u2014 one of those tubes,\nand called Bausch and Lomb, see if I could get a lens, and I did it, and I took a 10\ninch RCA TV and converted it to \u2014 made a little projection set. I put a 12 by 16 foot\nprojection set in the Shrine Auditorium in 1947 for the Rose Bowl game and the\nRose Parade. I sold 200 and \u2014 I sold 2400 s \u2014 I think \u2014 no, s \u2014 fe \u2014 was it \u2014 about a\nthousand seats anyway, at two dollars and 40 cents apiece for the whole Rose Bowl\ngame and the Rose Parade. I \u2014 I \u2014 I was sweating that, because I had two of these\nlittle TV projector things made up, and with a RCA chassis because if one failed, I\nthought I\u2019d re \u2014 I\u2019d get shot if something happened. But I went to Bodie(ph) plastic\nscreens, I could contact a guy in Hollywood that \u2014 cause I knew they made \u2014 you\nknow, they had their experimental TVs and ther \u2014 not TVs, but projections up there.\nThey already project them from the rear. So I got ahold of this Bodie(ph) plastic\nscreen guy out in \u2014 1n Venice, made the screens, and asked him if he can make me a\nscreen. So I had a 12 by 16 foot, they made a wooden frame and put this plastic on\nit, and they s \u2014 they\u2019d put the projector back there and ha-have a hot spot, and\nApril 26, 2013\nthey\u2019d spray with a \u2014 like a spray gun with plastic, and it would make it thicker in\nthe center, so 1t made it even, the light even. Wouldn\u2019t have a hot spot in the center.\nSo I parj \u2014 project it from the rear, and had a good time. I didn\u2019t have any\ncomplaints at all, and all these people over there got to see the Rose Bowl game. I\nmade money and \u2014",
        "A: I si\u2014told my parents a little bit about it. And then there\u2019s a family down about\nfour or five houses from my parents that was German ancestry and I \u2014 but the\nneighbors would ask me about stuff like that, I'd tell them a little bit about it. And\nthat family, the German family says oh, that\u2019s all a lie. There\u2019s no \u2014 no\nconcentration camps in Germany and stuff like that. They didn\u2019t believe any of it.\nAnd other people\u2019d say \u2014 you say something about it, a-are you sure that\u2019s true, you\nknow. Did that really happen? And they just question it, so we just \u2014 most \u2014 all of\nus, you talk to them, we sort of stopped talking about it. And I was \u2014 but I to \u2014 I just\ntell people \u2014 a lot of people about it, and a lot of people kind of yeah, yeah, yeah,\nsomething like that. But I never talked about it much, but about f\u2014 I don\u2019t know, 10\nor 15 years ago, I don\u2019t know how long it was, but I used to go to the VA hospital in\nLong Beach. And I went there one day, I \u2014 cause every month I\u2019d \u2014 I'd go in once a\nApril 26, 2013\nmonth and they\u2019d check my blood pressure and give me a\u2014 a -\u20141if I need vitamins,\nor whatever I needed, you know? And I went in there one day and I heard \u2014 they\npaged me to report to a certain office, and I did. I went in there and the guy sat\ndown and he says, I\u2019m the psychiatrist here at the hospital, and he said, I want to\ntalk to you. So I sat \u2014 sat down. He says, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re \u2014 right up here you\nwere in Buchenwald concentration camp, and he says, you\u2019re a liar. Just plain out,\nyou\u2019re a liar. You \u2014 you were in a POW camp. I says, doctor, I know the difference.\nYou don\u2019t. I just got up and walked out. But, you know, you get things like that, and\nso you kind of \u2014 you kind of \u2014 why talk about it? And the only time we really talk\nabout it was when our group got together, you know, we\u2019d talk about our stories,\nyou know, and stuff like that. And it hasn\u2019t been just til \u2014 til recent years, and then \u2014\nI don\u2019t even know how it happened, but the Santa Ana \u201cRegister\u201d heard about I\nguess this deal through s-someone, I don\u2019t know how they heard about it even. And\nthey called me up one time, wanted to come and talk to me. So they sent a reporter\nout to talk to me and then they put a whole thing in the Santa Ana \u201cRegister\u201d\nabout me and Buchenwald concentration camp and so forth. And pe \u2014 I started\ngetting calls, and then got a call from the Kiwanis Club down in Newport Beach,\nand they wanted me to come and talk to them about the experience. Got a call from\nthe Jewish war veterans. And you started getting all these calls that people want to\nApril 26, 2013\nknow about it, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s happened in recent years, you know. And it\u2019s\njust \u2014 it\u2019s strange. And then these movies would come out, you know, like Mike\nDorsey\u2019s film, and stuff like that. And it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, the last couple of\nyears or so it\u2019s just kind of come alive again.",
        "A: I\u2014I got s\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from the German government, the IMF, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, and I got, I don\u2019t know, seems to me like it was three\nor 4,000 dollars, something like that, quite a number of years ago. But I ran across\nsome of that paperwork recently, I was going through a bunch of stuff, and I don\u2019t\nremember exactly how much it was, but it was something like that, three or 4,000\ndollars, I was surprised. But it came from the IMF. I was surprised that \u2014 how they\ndid that whole thing. I thought, why did it come the International Monetary Fund?\nAnd I don\u2019t know if it was directly from Germany, or if 1t was negotiations. I \u2014 I\nknew nothing about how that all come about.",

        "A: The only thing I\u2019d like to say is, ve been very interested in the school system\nfor a long time, cause I have had a couple of kids go through it. My wife and I were\nboth involved heavily in the \u2014 going to school board meetings and stuff, and I was\nastonished at all \u2014 how little history and real information is being given and the \u2014\nthe \u2014 I don\u2019t think the teaching professions care much about this type of thing. And\nI\u2019ve always felt, and I\u2019ve heard many years that those who forget history are\ndeemed to relive it. And it scares me that the young people today know very little\nabout that stuff. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s maybe it\u2019s \u2014 a lot of 1t\u2019s kind of nasty, but I-I just\nthink that \u2014 that the school systems and the colleges even are \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to a lot of\ncollege professors and stuff. Like, my older son used to come home and tell me\nwhat the college professors are saying. And it just disturbed me that they are not\nmore knowledgeable. They should be, I think. And I just \u2014 that\u2019s part \u2014 it just\nbothers me that they\u2019re not educating the kids to really \u2014 what really went on in\nhistory, cause they don\u2019t even teach, I don\u2019t think, good old-time history, how this\ncountry was founded, you know. Our freedoms that we have. If you go to \u2014 if\nyou\u2019ve traveled much, and a lot of people haven\u2019t \u2014 I have, quite a bit in other\ncountries, and see how they operate and what\u2019s going on, and this is still the\nApril 26, 2013\ngreatest country there is, and the freedoms we have. But they seem to be gradually\ntaken away from us, and the \u2014 things now are happening today that disturb me\ngreatly, because it\u2019s just that little encroachment upon these little liberties and little\nthings, they\u2019re just going away, and th \u2014 though that\u2019s not right, you know, this, that\nand the other thing. But this country didn\u2019t grow, it didn\u2019t grow financially \u2014 it\u2019s\nbeen the most successful country in the world. And why people can\u2019t see that \u2014 to\nme it\u2019s obvious. And why do people from all over the world want to come to the\nUnited States? And that bothers me a great deal, that we don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it\njust \u2014 I\u2019m just disturbed by the way our country seems to be going, and that fact that\nyoung people don\u2019t really know anything about history. That part bothers me. My\ngrandkids, I\u2019m glad to say that I\u2014 I was able last year in April to \u2014 when I went to\nBuchenwald, and \u2014 by invitation of the Germans; my wife and I; my younger son\nand my grandkids; we took them, we went there, they were \u2014 spent a week at\nBuchenwald area, hearing all the speeches and seeing the graves and seeing all the\nhistory that took place there. And they were \u2014 my dau \u2014 granddaughter 1s fif \u2014 just\nturned 15, she\u2019s old enough to understand, she asked a lot of questions, so she was\ninquisitive. I just think more kids need to know about what really went on. I know\nthat some of it is nasty and bad, but that\u2019s life. And protecting them and saying\neverything\u2019s just hunky dory and sm-smiley roses all the time is not the way real\nApril 26, 2013\nlife is. So that part bothers me, I just \u2014 I-I just have strong feelings about our school\nsystem and things like that, I\u2014 I\u2019m bothered enough [indecipherable]. But it does,\nit bothers me a great deal that even grown-up people don\u2019t know. And\n[indecipherable] today, a lot of people still deny the Holocaust happened. How can\nthey deny it with so much evidence and \u2014 and everything? And yet people, th-they\nseem to have their head in the sand, to me. And maybe I\u2019m just an old \u2014 ignorant\nold man, but I-I feel that people need to o-open their eyes and look around, cause\nwe sure don\u2019t want to relive it. Anyway, that\u2019s my feelings, I just \u2014 you\u2019re stuck\nwith them.",
        "A: Oh, my pleasure. I just am glad that it \u2014 I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re doing this, to let the\nfuture know what really happened.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
