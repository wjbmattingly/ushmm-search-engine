        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I did. On \u2014 on the age of two, two and a half already, or a little\nbit more, I don\u2019t know, 19 \u2014 1942, when the first transport of people have been\ntaken from the Warsaw ghetto to extermination camp, in that \u2014 in that transport\nwent my family; my \u2014 my \u2014 my parent \u2014 my \u2014 o-on both sides, for the exception of\nthe \u2014 my \u2014 my mother\u2019s brother, one of them have been killed. I don\u2019t know if\nthat\u2019s by an accident or what, he be \u2014 was a fire on the roof in \u2014 in the ghetto. He\nwent up to the roof, but never came back. He was 25. His name was Ignatius. And\nthe youngest brother my \u2014 of my mother\u2019s, Henry. He was 18 and he \u2014 he took\npoison, he killed himself. But he was in the underground, the organization, had been\nNovember 8, 2008\ncaught, so in order to avoid, you know, further consequences, he did that. I \u2014\nMiriam, his younger sister, she had been taken to the \u2014 to the extermination camp\nwith my \u2014 with my grandmother, who at that time was fift \u2014 52 years old. And my\nmother was a widow on the age \u2014 age of 30. 30? Thir \u2014 31 - 32.",
        "Q: So, after the war started, what ha \u2014 what had happened to your family? Did they\ntry to escape Warsaw, or \u2014",
        "A: No, when my mother \u2014 my mother \u2014 my mother before the war was always\nadvising to leave to South America, because a cous \u2014 my ma \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my\ngrandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa \u2014\nalways like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir \u2014 in the late\n30s. But my \u2014 my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa \u2014 the\nbusiness was going well, and you know. They thought the war \u2014 nothing will\nhappens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was\nthe war start, like everybody else, we \u2014 we have to move into the ghetto. And the\nreason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three\nsurvivors, is because we didn\u2019t live in the same place where my grandmothers live\nand the family. And me \u2014 my \u2014 my father, the older men of the family, he \u2014 he was\nthere with \u2014 with the rest when they close and they ah \u2014 they emptied the building\nand took everybody away. So, my mom was \u2014 when she said well \u2014 she wa \u2014 she\nNovember 8, 2008\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the working\ncamps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for \u2014 for\ndeath, I am \u2014 I am running away. If I will be caught on the \u2014 on the run, at least I\ntried to do something for my life. So she \u2014 you know, was corruption, like\neverywhere else. So she \u2014 she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to\nsupply us with documents, aray \u2014 Aryan documents on the other side. They \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and\nthat took her a little bit more than she \u2014 sh-she \u2014 es \u2014 expect to take. So she was\nvery am \u2014 you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing\nthe document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the \u2014\nfrom the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s \u2014 as \u2014 close calls like\nthis, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the\nwar, where the \u2014 the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to\nget out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri \u2014 also risking a life. But coming\nback to those times \u2014 so we \u2014 we left \u2014 we left the ghetto, and my mother remember\nfrom her young age that her father was taking the family to spend the summer to a\nplace called Sandomierz on the south \u2014 on \u2014 a \u2014 a little bit south of Warsaw on the\nbank of the Wista river. And so sh \u2014 in order to run from Warsaw, she went there\nwith us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is\nNovember 8, 2008\nnoticeable immediately. So, very, very short time after, we were on our way back to\nWarsaw. And of course those \u2014 those voyages cost money, and we \u2014 we didn\u2019t\nhave too man \u2014 too much of it. So shortly after bri \u2014 getting back to Warsaw, her\neconomical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just\npresent herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a\nChristian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. And she says, well, if\nyou refuse to help me, I understand. It\u2019s a big risk. But 1f you can\u2019t, I have no one to\ncall any more, you know. So \u2014 and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all\nthe day there until the fire \u2014 the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to\nhim by herself. And he comes convince by her \u2014 his wife, to help us. And they\nadvise \u2014 the plan when he \u2014 what he comes with was the following. My sister, she\nwas a blonde with blue eyes, that\u2019s no problem. And \u2014 so she went to a \u2014 with \u2014\nwith \u2014 were nuns.",
        "Q: The con \u2014 the convent?",
        "A: Con-Convent.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My mom, he brought her a false document, put her fa \u2014 photography in that,\nsomebody who was deceased, more or less on the same age. The name was\nWovataska(ph) Janina(ph). And on these papers she should volunteer to work in\nNovember 8, 2008\nGermany. And this way, according to him, she would survive. And I was the\nproblem, being circumci \u2014 and he knew a place where he can take me, but the\ncondition was, to take kids there \u2014 so the kids who have no one, the orphans,\nabandoned.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Mm, right.",
        "A: So \u2014 because for security reasons, no visits, nobody coming, nobody know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So that \u2014 that was a condition for this. So he said to my mom, leave \u2014 the kids\nhave t \u2014 the kid had to be left in the corner of the street where I am due, where I am\nthere, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s my \u2014 my place to work, no? And my mother couldn\u2019t do that. Well,\nshe had \u2014 didn\u2019t have a heart to do that, so my poor sister have to di \u2014 do this for. So",
        "Q: And \u2014 and your sister was how old at this point?",
        "A: She was \u2014 she was at that time, she was nine. So, she had to leave me in the\ncorner and w \u2014 and, you know, just grab the first streetcar passing by, that what she\ndid. And I almost get her in, because I started to screaming myself. My sister\n[indecipherable]. People start to surround me and the policeman comes and he\ntook me, and [indecipherable] the people were, you know, that why\n[indecipherable] and the place called Klarasebo(ph) in the out-outskirts of\nNovember 8, 2008\nWarsaw, not far from Warsaw, very close to Wilarnow, which is the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthat was the \u2014 the summer palace of the k \u2014 the king of Poland in other times. And\nthe convent where I went to, that was a Methodist, it\u2019s not Catholic, it was\nMethodist. So, being Protestants, you know, the Germans didn\u2019t bother them, they\nthou \u2014 they thought they are part of them \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 right? Mas \u2014 or were more affinity. The woman who look after us, after the\nkids inside, were all Jewish womens. Yeah, for security reasons, you know, so\nthat\u2019s no \u2014 nobody would denounce, you know. Were personally interested, right?\nIn that\u2019s time I had two years and two months in that time, when I get separate from\nmy mom. And in \u2014 in 1946 in \u2014 in April \u2014 no, in April of you \u2014 April, end of April,\nmy mom found us, my sister and me, in a \u2014 and a ga \u2014 in a \u2014 1n a Jewish orphanage.\nThat was after the war, in Otwock. And that\u2019s 30 kilometers southeast of Warsaw,\non the eastern bank of the \u2014 of the river. In 1945, when the Germans start to retreat,\nobviously my sister said something which guides the people who are trying to put\nthe families together, because they knew about this organization, and \u2014 and in no\ntime I have been bring fr \u2014 brought from that place to \u2014 to the place where my sister\nwas. But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think they was just putting\nthe Jew \u2014 Jewish kids together. So maybe my \u2014 my sister didn\u2019t say tha \u2014 nothing, I\nNovember 8, 2008\ndon\u2019t know. So, we were taken to Otwock. And well, I survived this way, and I s \u2014\nwhen my mom comes, I was just re \u2014 convalescing from, I don\u2019t know, one of\nthose, you know, kids things, measles or something like that. So I\u2014I was separate\nfrom the rest of the kids, in order to avoid possible, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Contamination, right.",
        "A: \u2014 epidemics, yeah, right, right. So the lady who was looking after me, her name\nwas Dora, she \u2014 she ask me to [indecipherable] that\u2019s the \u2014 this Polish version of\nmy name, yeah. Said, do you know what \u2014 who 1s this lady? And I wa \u2014 I look on\nher, I remember I [indecipherable] a moment, no, and I said, well, that\u2019s my mom.\nAnd my da\u2014 my mother start to cry.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay, take your time.",
        "A: Crazy. Said, what happened to her, what\u2019s wrong with her? I couldn\u2019t understand\nwhy she\u2019s crying, you know? Well, I was too small to measure the time and\nemotions and things like that. And th \u2014 since then my life changed. So, after that we\ntried to escape from Poland, and we managed to do that. My mom was a very brave\nwoman, you know. Brave, have guts more than one man \u2014 man who would like to\nhave it. And so we \u2014 we escaped from Poland, three \u2014 four of us. Was my \u2014 the\nthree of, my mother, my sister, me, plus a young woman, she was 24 at that time,\nMaryla(ph) \u2014 I don\u2019t recall her last name now, from Wroclaw. She joined because\nNovember 8, 2008\nshe was a daughter of an officer who was a s \u2014 immediate superior to my father av \u2014\nmy \u2014 my \u2014 my mother comes back to Poland, she was remarried.",

And he was in the \u2014 in\nRAF in England, the Polish squadron, and so the \u2014 she remarried him. He was a\nvery, very good man, he was a excellent stepfather for me. Stepfather sounds bad,\nwas a good father, I mean. And \u2014 but he was not Jewish, he was Christian, so I\ndidn\u2019t live \u2014 grow in the Jewish environment with its relations and everything else, I\nhave been deprived from that, all this.",
        "Q: Let me \u2014",
        "A: In 1946, in oc \u2014 in octo \u2014 October, he had been transfer to England, and with\nhim, of course, the family. So \u2014 and also they say, was the kind of person, he says,\nwell, we are \u2014 1f we\u2019re going to be a family, one family, let\u2019s have one surname, so\nhe adopt us both. My daughter \u2014 my sister and me. And in October of the same\nyear, we were in o \u2014 already in England, was an entirely different life. And we stay\nin England until 1949, and my parents decide for Argentina. So we emigrate to\nArgentina in 1949. So the \u2014 wha \u2014 first, second and third grade, I made it in\nNovember 8, 2008\nEngland, and through grade four I went, 1-in sp \u2014 in Spanish in Buenos Aires.\nWell, and I studied in Spanish and I lived there until I reached the age of 38. Of\ncourse, I get married in the meantime to a Italian girl, a schoolmate, my schoolmate,\nand we had four wonderful daughters. I lost my wife 10 years ago.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: And I have six grandchildren. And when this congress had a place in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nToronto, completely by chance, somebody who I knew who was living in the \u2014 in\nmassa \u2014 who lives in Massachusetts, called me by phone and said, oh listen, on so\nand so date, I \u2014 I\u2019m going to \u2014 we are going to be in Toronto, herself and her\nhusband. So we will like invite you for a dinner Friday with us. And maybe you\u2019re\ndaughter and your s-son-in-law can join us. So I said, well, I\u2019m answering by\nmyself because I am no \u2014 I have no commitment, will be a pleasure, and about them\nI have to find out, I don\u2019t know. They may be coming to something else \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 maybe they can. And that\u2019s \u2014 really, that what happens, they couldn\u2019t attend,\nso I went by myself. So we \u2014 we tal \u2014 we talk about different things and finally\ncomes a topic, what brought you to Toronto? And so she mentioned that she is\ncoming to a congress of the hidden children [indecipherable] hidden children of\n[indecipherable]. What is this? She said, oh, you know, the kids, you know, were\nNovember 8, 2008\nhidden and \u2014 you know, on the Christian houses or here and there, and they \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 in the churches. Say, I fit perfectly to this category. So \u2014 so I get interested,\nand that was my fir \u2014 first attendance, no re \u2014 with no registration, because I learned\nthe \u2014 the same day, or very \u2014 very same day about.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Next day was starting day, the \u2014 the congress. So I went there. I met lots of\npeople, different people from different places, and I learn about some \u2014 I \u2014 I meet\nsome people who were in Otwock at the same time I were. Of course, now I \u2014 now\nI remember the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because I was in the youngest group. But some \u2014 some of the people I met, they\ndo remember my sister, who was seven years older than me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so after that, I re \u2014 I was very excited about that, and I called my nephew.\nOkay, I have to tell you my sister passed away very young, on the age of 46, that\nwas in 1979. So, I called my \u2014 my nephew, and I mention to him that I \u2014 because I\nknew always [indecipherable] he was very curious about where he is coming from\nand whatever, but hi \u2014 his story [indecipherable] story. But, you know, my sister as\nwell, she didn't have a chance \u2014 she was never in the Jewish environment. She\nNovember 8, 2008\nmarried to a very nice person, but he was a Christian from the \u2014 from Pomerania.\nThat\u2019s the northern part of Poland, right on the sea, on the Baltic. A very\nhandsome, nice fellow, so they were \u2014 were okay, but the \u2014 the tr \u2014 all the tradition\nand everything what could be, have been lost. So, somehow we were lost for the\nJewish community, right? But my s \u2014 nephew always was curious about that, and\nthat was something which, for obvious reasons, my sister didn\u2019t talk about that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because she was hidden, her br \u2014 her origin, as my mother did. As long my\nmother lived, I never mention my origin. I respect her will because listen, I don\u2019t\nknow what she went through, what she passed, what make her decide to take this \u2014\nto decide that. So I were \u2014 I were no one to challenge her decision, so I accept it like\nthis. Once \u2014 once before, she was still alive, I come to the dilemma, what shall I do?\nIf I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not? And that was \u2014 ma \u2014 ma \u2014 my \u2014\nmy \u2014 my daughter was like \u2014 my older daughter was like 10 years old, and the next\none was almost nine. And my mother says, you know, this is something, it\u2019s a big\nquestion. I\u2019m not in position to tell you what to do. And after, you know, a\u2014a\npause, she said, if you want to save them \u2014 to save them suffering, don\u2019t say it.",
        "Q: Wow.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: That was what she told me. But I \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014 you know, I kept thinking about it,\nand finally I told the decision to say it, because in [indecipherable] maybe by\nignorance, some of our \u2014 my kids be in the environment where they will come to be\na \u2014 maybe anti-Semitic or something like this. That\u2019s what\u2019ll be the worst thing\nwhat could happen to me right now. So I said that, and that was the time when my \u2014\nmy wife learned about my [indecipherable]. And I said, well, don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t\nhave to worry about, because according to the Christian religion, I am a Christian,\nnever mind ho \u2014 how my person 1s. I have been Christian, I still am Christian. But I\ndon\u2019t want to deny it, where I\u2019m coming from, and it\u2019s nice to be able to say the\ntruth. So that\u2019s was years ago, and then once ma \u2014 I had contact with Jews in my\ntrade, because I was in the fur business. And I\u2019d just been exporting fur from\nArgentina to Europe [indecipherable] when I matured to do that, before I was a\nfurrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, and then I comes to be an exporter. But the\npeople who I knew and I was dealing with almost on the daily basis, most of them\nwere Jews. Some of them, they come to be very close friends of mine. People much\nmature, 30 years older than me. So they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they lived this period of the\nHolocaust entirely differently than I did. They were fi \u2014 16 - 17, you know, young\npeople, o-or 30 \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 when you \u2014 when I born. So \u2014 and sh \u2014 well, make \u2014 always, you know,\nexchanging point of view ideas and histories and so in \u2014 and that was something\nwhich was eating me up, you know, because on the one side I were so close to\nthem, and I want to be one of them. And that was the Polisher, because I speak very\ngood Polish, and I never learned to speak Yiddish, unfortunately, so well, that\u2019s life.\nI lived the way I could.",

So when I\ncall my \u2014 my \u2014 my nephew, and I told him that I met people from the place I have\nbeen in Poland, in the orphanage, and I mention the place, Otwock, say well, you\nknow, I \u2014 looking through the papers, Mommy ple \u2014 papers, I find the pho \u2014-a\u2014a\npicture, a photo, and on the \u2014 on the reverse says, something written, in Otwock,\n1945.

        "A: [indecipherable] I did. On \u2014 on the age of two, two and a half already, or a little\nbit more, I don\u2019t know, 19 \u2014 1942, when the first transport of people have been\ntaken from the Warsaw ghetto to extermination camp, in that \u2014 in that transport\nwent my family; my \u2014 my \u2014 my parent \u2014 my \u2014 o-on both sides, for the exception of\nthe \u2014 my \u2014 my mother\u2019s brother, one of them have been killed. I don\u2019t know if\nthat\u2019s by an accident or what, he be \u2014 was a fire on the roof in \u2014 in the ghetto. He\nwent up to the roof, but never came back. He was 25. His name was Ignatius. And\nthe youngest brother my \u2014 of my mother\u2019s, Henry. He was 18 and he \u2014 he took\npoison, he killed himself. But he was in the underground, the organization, had been\nNovember 8, 2008\ncaught, so in order to avoid, you know, further consequences, he did that. I \u2014\nMiriam, his younger sister, she had been taken to the \u2014 to the extermination camp\nwith my \u2014 with my grandmother, who at that time was fift \u2014 52 years old. And my\nmother was a widow on the age \u2014 age of 30. 30? Thir \u2014 31 - 32.",
        "A: No, when my mother \u2014 my mother \u2014 my mother before the war was always\nadvising to leave to South America, because a cous \u2014 my ma \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014 my\ngrandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa \u2014\nalways like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir \u2014 in the late\n30s. But my \u2014 my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa \u2014 the\nbusiness was going well, and you know. They thought the war \u2014 nothing will\nhappens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was\nthe war start, like everybody else, we \u2014 we have to move into the ghetto. And the\nreason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three\nsurvivors, is because we didn\u2019t live in the same place where my grandmothers live\nand the family. And me \u2014 my \u2014 my father, the older men of the family, he \u2014 he was\nthere with \u2014 with the rest when they close and they ah \u2014 they emptied the building\nand took everybody away. So, my mom was \u2014 when she said well \u2014 she wa \u2014 she\nNovember 8, 2008\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the working\ncamps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for \u2014 for\ndeath, I am \u2014 I am running away. If I will be caught on the \u2014 on the run, at least I\ntried to do something for my life. So she \u2014 you know, was corruption, like\neverywhere else. So she \u2014 she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to\nsupply us with documents, aray \u2014 Aryan documents on the other side. They \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and\nthat took her a little bit more than she \u2014 sh-she \u2014 es \u2014 expect to take. So she was\nvery am \u2014 you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing\nthe document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the \u2014\nfrom the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s \u2014 as \u2014 close calls like\nthis, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the\nwar, where the \u2014 the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to\nget out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri \u2014 also risking a life. But coming\nback to those times \u2014 so we \u2014 we left \u2014 we left the ghetto, and my mother remember\nfrom her young age that her father was taking the family to spend the summer to a\nplace called Sandomierz on the south \u2014 on \u2014 a \u2014 a little bit south of Warsaw on the\nbank of the Wista river. And so sh \u2014 in order to run from Warsaw, she went there\nwith us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is\nNovember 8, 2008\nnoticeable immediately. So, very, very short time after, we were on our way back to\nWarsaw. And of course those \u2014 those voyages cost money, and we \u2014 we didn\u2019t\nhave too man \u2014 too much of it. So shortly after bri \u2014 getting back to Warsaw, her\neconomical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just\npresent herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a\nChristian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. And she says, well, if\nyou refuse to help me, I understand. It\u2019s a big risk. But 1f you can\u2019t, I have no one to\ncall any more, you know. So \u2014 and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all\nthe day there until the fire \u2014 the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to\nhim by herself. And he comes convince by her \u2014 his wife, to help us. And they\nadvise \u2014 the plan when he \u2014 what he comes with was the following. My sister, she\nwas a blonde with blue eyes, that\u2019s no problem. And \u2014 so she went to a \u2014 with \u2014\nwith \u2014 were nuns.",

And on these papers she should volunteer to work in\nNovember 8, 2008\nGermany. And this way, according to him, she would survive. And I was the\nproblem, being circumci \u2014 and he knew a place where he can take me, but the\ncondition was, to take kids there \u2014 so the kids who have no one, the orphans,\nabandoned.",
        "A: So \u2014 because for security reasons, no visits, nobody coming, nobody know.",

And my mother couldn\u2019t do that. Well,\nshe had \u2014 didn\u2019t have a heart to do that, so my poor sister have to di \u2014 do this for. So",
        "A: She was \u2014 she was at that time, she was nine. So, she had to leave me in the\ncorner and w \u2014 and, you know, just grab the first streetcar passing by, that what she\ndid.

And\nthe convent where I went to, that was a Methodist, it\u2019s not Catholic, it was\nMethodist. So, being Protestants, you know, the Germans didn\u2019t bother them, they\nthou \u2014 they thought they are part of them \u2014",

Yeah, for security reasons, you know, so\nthat\u2019s no \u2014 nobody would denounce, you know. Were personally interested, right?\nIn that\u2019s time I had two years and two months in that time, when I get separate from\nmy mom. And in \u2014 in 1946 in \u2014 in April \u2014 no, in April of you \u2014 April, end of April,\nmy mom found us, my sister and me, in a \u2014 and a ga \u2014 in a \u2014 1n a Jewish orphanage.\nThat was after the war, in Otwock.

But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think they was just putting\nthe Jew \u2014 Jewish kids together. So maybe my \u2014 my sister didn\u2019t say tha \u2014 nothing, I\nNovember 8, 2008\ndon\u2019t know. So, we were taken to Otwock. And well, I survived this way, and I s \u2014\nwhen my mom comes, I was just re \u2014 convalescing from, I don\u2019t know, one of\nthose, you know, kids things, measles or something like that.

Stepfather sounds bad,\nwas a good father, I mean. And \u2014 but he was not Jewish, he was Christian, so I\ndidn\u2019t live \u2014 grow in the Jewish environment with its relations and everything else, I\nhave been deprived from that, all this.",
        "A: In 1946, in oc \u2014 in octo \u2014 October, he had been transfer to England, and with\nhim, of course, the family. So \u2014 and also they say, was the kind of person, he says,\nwell, we are \u2014 1f we\u2019re going to be a family, one family, let\u2019s have one surname, so\nhe adopt us both. My daughter \u2014 my sister and me. And in October of the same\nyear, we were in o \u2014 already in England, was an entirely different life. And we stay\nin England until 1949, and my parents decide for Argentina. So we emigrate to\nArgentina in 1949. So the \u2014 wha \u2014 first, second and third grade, I made it in\nNovember 8, 2008\nEngland, and through grade four I went, 1-in sp \u2014 in Spanish in Buenos Aires.\nWell, and I studied in Spanish and I lived there until I reached the age of 38. Of\ncourse, I get married in the meantime to a Italian girl, a schoolmate, my schoolmate,\nand we had four wonderful daughters. I lost my wife 10 years ago.",
        "A: And I have six grandchildren. And when this congress had a place in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nToronto, completely by chance, somebody who I knew who was living in the \u2014 in\nmassa \u2014 who lives in Massachusetts, called me by phone and said, oh listen, on so\nand so date, I \u2014 I\u2019m going to \u2014 we are going to be in Toronto, herself and her\nhusband. So we will like invite you for a dinner Friday with us. And maybe you\u2019re\ndaughter and your s-son-in-law can join us. So I said, well, I\u2019m answering by\nmyself because I am no \u2014 I have no commitment, will be a pleasure, and about them\nI have to find out, I don\u2019t know. They may be coming to something else \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 maybe they can. And that\u2019s \u2014 really, that what happens, they couldn\u2019t attend,\nso I went by myself. So we \u2014 we tal \u2014 we talk about different things and finally\ncomes a topic, what brought you to Toronto? And so she mentioned that she is\ncoming to a congress of the hidden children [indecipherable] hidden children of\n[indecipherable]. What is this? She said, oh, you know, the kids, you know, were\nNovember 8, 2008\nhidden and \u2014 you know, on the Christian houses or here and there, and they \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 in the churches. Say, I fit perfectly to this category. So \u2014 so I get interested,\nand that was my fir \u2014 first attendance, no re \u2014 with no registration, because I learned\nthe \u2014 the same day, or very \u2014 very same day about.",
        "A: Next day was starting day, the \u2014 the congress. So I went there. I met lots of\npeople, different people from different places, and I learn about some \u2014 I \u2014 I meet\nsome people who were in Otwock at the same time I were. Of course, now I \u2014 now\nI remember the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because I was in the youngest group. But some \u2014 some of the people I met, they\ndo remember my sister, who was seven years older than me.",
        "A: And so after that, I re \u2014 I was very excited about that, and I called my nephew.\nOkay, I have to tell you my sister passed away very young, on the age of 46, that\nwas in 1979. So, I called my \u2014 my nephew, and I mention to him that I \u2014 because I\nknew always [indecipherable] he was very curious about where he is coming from\nand whatever, but hi \u2014 his story [indecipherable] story. But, you know, my sister as\nwell, she didn't have a chance \u2014 she was never in the Jewish environment. She\nNovember 8, 2008\nmarried to a very nice person, but he was a Christian from the \u2014 from Pomerania.\nThat\u2019s the northern part of Poland, right on the sea, on the Baltic. A very\nhandsome, nice fellow, so they were \u2014 were okay, but the \u2014 the tr \u2014 all the tradition\nand everything what could be, have been lost. So, somehow we were lost for the\nJewish community, right? But my s \u2014 nephew always was curious about that, and\nthat was something which, for obvious reasons, my sister didn\u2019t talk about that.",
        "A: Because she was hidden, her br \u2014 her origin, as my mother did. As long my\nmother lived, I never mention my origin. I respect her will because listen, I don\u2019t\nknow what she went through, what she passed, what make her decide to take this \u2014\nto decide that. So I were \u2014 I were no one to challenge her decision, so I accept it like\nthis. Once \u2014 once before, she was still alive, I come to the dilemma, what shall I do?\nIf I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not? And that was \u2014 ma \u2014 ma \u2014 my \u2014\nmy \u2014 my daughter was like \u2014 my older daughter was like 10 years old, and the next\none was almost nine. And my mother says, you know, this is something, it\u2019s a big\nquestion. I\u2019m not in position to tell you what to do. And after, you know, a\u2014a\npause, she said, if you want to save them \u2014 to save them suffering, don\u2019t say it.\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: That was what she told me. But I \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014 you know, I kept thinking about it,\nand finally I told the decision to say it, because in [indecipherable] maybe by\nignorance, some of our \u2014 my kids be in the environment where they will come to be\na \u2014 maybe anti-Semitic or something like this. That\u2019s what\u2019ll be the worst thing\nwhat could happen to me right now. So I said that, and that was the time when my \u2014\nmy wife learned about my [indecipherable]. And I said, well, don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t\nhave to worry about, because according to the Christian religion, I am a Christian,\nnever mind ho \u2014 how my person 1s. I have been Christian, I still am Christian. But I\ndon\u2019t want to deny it, where I\u2019m coming from, and it\u2019s nice to be able to say the\ntruth. So that\u2019s was years ago, and then once ma \u2014 I had contact with Jews in my\ntrade, because I was in the fur business. And I\u2019d just been exporting fur from\nArgentina to Europe [indecipherable] when I matured to do that, before I was a\nfurrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, and then I comes to be an exporter. But the\npeople who I knew and I was dealing with almost on the daily basis, most of them\nwere Jews. Some of them, they come to be very close friends of mine. People much\nmature, 30 years older than me. So they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they lived this period of the\nHolocaust entirely differently than I did. They were fi \u2014 16 - 17, you know, young\npeople, o-or 30 \u2014\nNovember 8, 2008",
        "A: \u2014 when you \u2014 when I born. So \u2014 and sh \u2014 well, make \u2014 always, you know,\nexchanging point of view ideas and histories and so in \u2014 and that was something\nwhich was eating me up, you know, because on the one side I were so close to\nthem, and I want to be one of them. And that was the Polisher, because I speak very\ngood Polish, and I never learned to speak Yiddish, unfortunately, so well, that\u2019s life.\nI lived the way I could.",
        "A: And at this stage of my life, since they to \u2014 the when \u2014 since, I think was 2001 or\n2002, when this pi \u2014 this \u2014 this congress and wa \u2014 in Toronto has place. So when I\ncall my \u2014 my \u2014 my nephew, and I told him that I met people from the place I have\nbeen in Poland, in the orphanage, and I mention the place, Otwock, say well, you\nknow, I \u2014 looking through the papers, Mommy ple \u2014 papers, I find the pho \u2014-a\u2014a\npicture, a photo, and on the \u2014 on the reverse says, something written, in Otwock,\n1945. Said, can I have this picture or the copy of it? Copy it on both sides. And he\ndid so an-and \u2014 and send it to me immediately. Very diligent, cause I spoke to him\nThursday and Monday I had the photo in Toronto. And he lives in San Francisco,\nso for a freight express, immediately. And, in the photograph it was three young\ngirls, and two little boys, one of them were myself, and \u2014 and bres to another boy\nlike this, sitting the front, and three girls standing in the back. So also, after the\nNovember 8, 2008\ncongress in Toronto, some of the people I met there, they invite me to have a tea in\nthe house, that\u2019s all, to get closer. And one of the ladies, who is 10 years older than\nme, she is almost 80, she is eight \u2014 79. Very nice person. I was in her house, made a\nmention about this photography and I brought that with me, the copy. And she say,\none \u2014 one second. She went, and she brought the album, and had the same\nphotography made, because the one who was making the photos was her brother,\nher older brother. He \u2014 he was a, you know, he was an amateur, he likes to make\nphotos, and he was the one who make this photo. So in \u2014 so she says, you know,\nthis one, Vanda, I don\u2019t recall the last names. [indecipherable] I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t\nrecall \u2014 is living in Tel Aviv, and this other one, also Vanda, lives in \u2014 in\nJerusalem. She is not passing a very good moment in her life because she is \u2014 no \u2014\nshe is 70, she is overweight, she\u2019s depressed, blah, blah [indecipherable]. Maybe I\nhave to go there and cheer her up, I said, just making a joke, big joke, okay. So, and\nsay, but you know who is living there is this person, Kornblum(ph) his last name\n[indecipherable] he is very much involved in keeping the \u2014 the \u2014 the people who\nwere in this orphanage together, you know, and following who is living where,\nhaving the phone number to get in touch, and he also pub \u2014 publish a boo \u2014 a little\nbook, memories of the young \u2014 a young boy\u2019s memories, of his period of time on \u2014\nduring the war. And he is a very nice person, you can approach him, and he will be\nNovember 8, 2008\nan excellent guide for you when you go there. An-And me \u2014 so I never had been in\nIsrael before, and that was something which I own on myself. Actually, we were s\n\u2014 we were planning to go with my wife, in \u2014 in the year 2000, but she passed away\nin 1999 in April. So I didn't go, and after that I didn\u2019t felt like to go, you know.",
        "A: So, a\u2014 acouple years later, I called this person to \u2014 to Tel Aviv, and so okay,\nshould I speak to you \u2014 you in English, or in Polish, what 1 \u2014 how do you feel more\ncomfortable? So, either way. So we start to speak Polish, and I say, well, I am \u2014 I \u2014\nI introduce myself. Say, oh, Sophie\u2019s brother. This touch my heart.

They were\nclassmates, Sophie\u2019s classma \u2014 classmates, so they knew each other \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 very well. My feeling seems \u2014 the congress in \u2014 in Toronto was very lucrative\n[indecipherable] I should call it like that. But a-also was emotional because I \u2014 I\nmet people who I knew these people exist maybe \u2014 may exist, but I didn\u2019t know\nhow they are, where they are, right? And then \u2014 but brought me back to the family.\nAnd when I met blum \u2014 Kornblum(ph), and his wife, we agreed to meet in the\nmorning for breakfast together in the hotel where I were standing. I didn\u2019t know\nNovember 8, 2008\nhim and he didn\u2019t know me, but I imagine that must be the person, and he was.\nVery pleasant. His wife was a little darling. And we stopped to talk at nine o\u2019clock\non the morning, was 12, lunchtime already, we were sti \u2014 still talking.
