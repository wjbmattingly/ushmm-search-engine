And my mother didn\u2019t\nrecognize her father because suddenly he had lost a hundred pounds and his hair was white. And\nbut I did and I was, according to my grandfather, this is. I just grabbed his leg and said Jaji, [ph]\nJaji, which means grandpa, grandpa. Because he was, and that was by the way the first I spoke,\nwere not mama or dada but Jaju, because he and I had a very special bond.

        "A: Yes, my baby sister was born well, she\u2019s a year and a half younger than I. I can\u2019t remember\nexactly her birthday. But \u2014",

        "A: My first memory 1s in the bunker.",
        "Q: In the ghetto?",
        "A: No. My grandfather had, then was in concentration camp. Captured and put into the Janov\nkilling camp. It must have been around 1943. And yeah \u2014",
        "Q: So you\u2019re now two years old.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: Right. And while we\u2019re hiding in the ghetto, my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he\nescapes from concentration camp and manages to get across a railroad track just as a Nazi\nmunitions train was going. So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they\nshot him in the hand and shot his finger. And he started running away as the train was coming\nby. And of course they did not dare fire at that train because there would be a massive\nexplosion. Ok. Then while he was running this was in a woods, a very deep woods in Lvov. And\nhe met a peasant named Mr. Borecki. And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather\u2019s\ndiary. Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was\na very big man and no shoes could fit him. So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and\nhad him sleep in the barn and gave him three breads.\nAnd my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --. He said well Pll just leave my barn\ndoor open. Then if I get asked, I could say I don\u2019t know who sleeps in my barn. So my\ngrandfather did that and the next day he left. And when he was in the woods, oh and he was\ngiven a shovel. And in the woods, he was sitting there. And suddenly he heard two or three men\nspeaking Yiddish. And they had escaped an aktion, very near this woods. And one of them had a\ngun. And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess\nbecause he looked good on a horse. The Polish cavalry.\nHe did. And I think that\u2019s why they took him. But anyway, so he was -- they made him the\nleader. They dug this tunnel and that\u2019s the one that I called the bunker. Ok, it\u2019s a tunnel in this\nwoods, yes. And \u2014",
        "Q: How far from the ghetto?",
        "A: Quite a ways I think. Because this was in the woods and the ghetto \u2014 now, I'll describe the\nbunker in just a moment. But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two\nthings. One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki\u2019s son had been killed by the Nazis.\nBecause he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance. Now but before then he had told his\nfather that the Nazis were going to bomb the ghetto very soon. So my grandfather knew that it\nwas just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives.\nOk. Now I\u2019m going to switch back and tell you about the bunker.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nThe bunker to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud. And there was a ladder to go in\nand as I remember it, it seemed very tall. Probably it was no more than six feet. And as you\nwalked around, you felt this cold, wet mud. And at one side, here was the entrance. Then there\nwas this cold wet mud. And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a table, like the\nkind that electric wire comes on, those spool tables. And I just, I remember it feeling splintery.\nAnd I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that table.\nAnd then again some more wet mud. Then like an archway out of mud again and a separate\nroom. On the, as you walked into that room, on the left were things that I later found out were\nguns. And rifles. What I, and how I, I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather\nsmacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand. And\nthat\u2019s when I realized those were dangerous.\nI don\u2019t remember the people in the tunnel. Now I\u2019m going to switch back and tell you.\nEventually there were 37 people in the tunnel. But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis\nwere going to bomb the ghetto he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men\nvolunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms. Well I have to tell you that how\nthey lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid Nazi trucks. They would raise,\nthey would kill the drivers and take \u2014",
        "Q: They were escaped from the ghetto.",
        "A: They were not in the ghetto. They were in this woods, in the bunker. And they would go out\non raids where they would raid Nazi munitions, trucks, outposts. Take whatever, food, clothing,\neverything. Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this\nwoods and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep\ntrying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn\u2019t. So the Nazis thought that these Jews\nwho were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters. But they were\nnot. Now the Banderovski didn\u2019t like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews\nwere doctors. Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way. We\u2019ll stay out of your\nway kind of thing. We\u2019ll leave you alone. And that\u2019s what happened.\nWell my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son,\nthe Nazis were going to burn the ghetto so he got the two volunteers. They all dressed in Nazi\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nuniforms, had commandeered a Nazi jeep and drove to the outskirts of the ghetto at night. The\ntwo men stayed. My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the ghetto, got my mother, my father,\nmy baby sister and me out. Put us in this jeep and brought us to the home of Mr. Borecki.\nBecause my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother\nand the two girls\u2019 lives and he said of course. And so we came in the middle of the night and we\nwere at Mr. Borecki\u2019s house and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father. I\nwill not. I\u2019ve already lost my mother. I\u2019m not going to lose you. So they had no choice but all of\nus now went to the bunker.",
        "Q: This is 1943.",
        "A: 1943.",
        "Q: Do you know what month or what season?",
        "A: I-",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right.",
        "A: It probably was still winter. Because there was snow and the bunker was still relatively safe\nbecause the Nazis could, dogs could not get the scent and stuff. So it was winter, probably.",
        "Q: End of 43?",
        "A: Yes, mm hm. Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm. Then apparently and this I hear from\nmy grandfather, my baby sister. Oh there were 37 people in that tunnel. My mother and my\nfather and us. My grandfather\u2019s son, my uncle, his wife. And I think their two boys. They had\ntwo boys. My sister and I were the youngest, by far. And I guess we cried and got lice and\npeople were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody. And my grandfather felt\nthat he just could not do that. That his family could not endanger everybody else because\neveryone wanted to live and they had the right to live.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nSo he decided to take us. He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket. He dressed himself as a\nPolish peasant and took my baby sister and me out. I guess according to my grandfather, I had\nblond hair and dark eyes. My sister had light hair and gray eyes. And he took us both and he\nwent to the local market, looking for someone named Dr. Gruen. Dr. Gruen was a Pole. I think\nhe was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an orphanage for Catholic children. And he\nlooked for, but he couldn\u2019t find him. And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary. He\nwas so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn\u2019t find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was\nready, he was ready to leave us in the market, thinking somebody would find us and keep us.\nAnd keep us alive during the war.\nBut just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor. A Polish\nCatholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals. And\nmy grandfather had helped her with her horse and carriage business. So she saw him and\nrecognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard. And of course she\nsaid she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and\nhe couldn\u2019t find Dr. Gruen. And at that point, he said could you take them. And my grandmother\nhad had to sell her house because the people she had working for her were Jews. And they were\nall in the ghetto and so she couldn\u2019t make a living. So she started working as a cook for a retired\nengineer and his wife, the Szwarczynskis, somewhere in the country. It must have been near\nLvov. And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were\nher sister\u2019s children. Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the\nUkraine and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to Ukraine and left their\nbabies with her. And then she asked Mrs. Szwarczynski could she, could grandma take both.\nAnd Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me. But she couldn\u2019t take a six month old baby.\nSo my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this orphanage. And\napparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the orphanage was and so\nforth. So grandpa had \u2014 now remember all this time he\u2019s passing as a Polish peasant. Very big\none. But the Polish peasant and because my grandfather was six, two and well over 200 pounds.\nHe was -- just an aside. The first time I read Les Miserables, I kept thinking of my grandfather.\nBecause remember Jean Valjean lifts a cart and that\u2019s how Javert knows that he is Jean\nValjean. Well my grandfather could lift a car. So I huss? Anyway, sidebar finished.\nNow back to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "Q: You were telling me about your sister.",
        "A: My sister\u2019s name was changed from Tola to Antonina Noviska, which was the name of the\nwoman who saved our lives. Lucia Noviska and that\u2019s when she was left there. And I stayed\nwith the Szwarczynskis and my grandmother. I have a picture, the first picture I have of me was\nat around that time. I was probably around two and a half at this point maybe even three. And I\nhad been following my grandmother who was going into the countryside to forage for whatever\nshe could find in the way of food. And \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember this time?",
        "A: I, again I remember \u2014",
        "Q: Flashes?",
        "A: Flashes, that\u2019s right. I remember that I wanted her to play with me. I remember that we\npicked dandelions together. And she made me a wreath out of dandelions. And I remember\nputting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep. And this I was told\nlater. That grandma had gone home, thinking that I had probably gone home. And when she\ndidn\u2019t find me there, she was standing outside waiting for me. And ready to go look for me with\nMrs. Szwarczynski. And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body.\nAnd so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told\nher to stay calm. And the soldier came and at that point I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know but I woke up. And\nso grandma was just unbelievably relieved. And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he\nfound me there. And I reminded him of his children back home and so he was bringing me to\nthe closest house because he was sure that\u2019s where I lived.\nSo some kind of way later he had the picture developed and grandma got it and she took that\npicture, saved it and after the war. And by the way that picture is in the Holocaust Museum. As is\na picture of my birth mother, father, uncle and two friends.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nWell anyway then we were still there with the Szwarczynskis. The Szwarczynskis had a dog.\nGreat big huge German shepherd, really fierce watchdog. So fierce that he was not in the house.\nHe was kept on a chain outdoors and fed with a long stick. And one day, again this I was told.\nOne day the dog was outside and I went over to the dog and my grandmother was about to\nscream again. And Mrs. Szwarczynski kept her from yelling and I went over to the dog and\npetted the dog and he started licking me and we became great buddies. Now what I do remember\nis that when the Nazis came I was told to take the dog and go under the table with the dog. Now\none possibility is that, that just as they said to make sure that the dog didn\u2019t remove the Nazi\u2019s\nleg because he had bitten a Nazi before. The other possibility, although it\u2019s fairly remote is that\nthey suspected I was a Jewish child. But I think that\u2019s fairly remote because they were a bit anti-\nSemitic also. And my, there was a woman on the street near where the Szwarczynskis lived who\nhad told the Nazis that Lucia Noviska was hiding a Jewish child. So the Nazis came and took\nher and she was imprisoned. And tortured. And my grandfather of course found out about that\nand he went to Mrs. Szwarczynski and said look, you have to do something. We have to get my\nwife out. And Mrs. Szwarczynski was a good friend of the wife of the commandant and so Mrs.\nSzwarczynski went to the commandant and said you know look, to the wife and said to her, look\nyou know the Nazis have taken my cook and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do because we\nneed her. And she certainly 1s not hiding any Jewish children. And the commandant\u2019s wife talked\nto her husband and the next thing is that the commandant came and she was released from prison\nand told not to talk about it to anyone. And she was released and came back.\nNow what I remember I had \u2014 I was in kind of a crib. I remember a crib with a ladder to get to\nthe crib. And I just remember a ladder that I would climb out of the crib and into. One day I\nheard some noise, lots and lots of noise and the dog came. And grabbed me, some kind of way.\nEither I was on the ladder, I don\u2019t know. But the dog grabbed my clothing or grabbed me,\nsomething, and took me to the door of the house. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where this was\nvis a vis the bedroom. I don\u2019t remember any of this. I do remember the dog taking me. And I do\nremember that a bomb fell on where I had been sleeping.\nSo cause there was lots of bombing going on at that time. And \u2014",
        "Q: This is what, spring of 44?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: This is I think not, yes, not, not, not spring yet. Probably \u2014 like February. In April of 1944,\nright around my birthday my grandfather talked to my grandmother and said look I have to go\nback and see how everybody is doing in the bunker, in the tunnel. And so I\u2019m going to go back.\nSo he went back to the tunnel.",
        "Q: He went by himself.",
        "A: And he saw one other man there who was alive and everybody else had been shot and\nbombed. And he buried everyone.",
        "Q: Your grandfather?",
        "A: And (pause, sigh) and then in 1944 in June, the Russians came to Lvov. And the one\nadvantage we had with the Russians at that time was because grandpa was a survivor of a killing\ncamp, the Russians gave him preferential treatment which meant that he could get an apartment\nin the bombed out buildings. He could get rags for clothes, that kind of thing. So that\u2019s what\nhappened. And that was right around my birthday I think. And then we went to one DP camp\nwhich 1s displaced persons. But I like to think of it as delayed pilgrims. Yes so very delayed. So\nthen \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember the time of leaving where you were living --",
        "A: I remember the first apartment because \u2014",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s, do you remember your leaving the house? Do you remember that at all?",
        "A: Of the, but when the dog took me \u2014",
        "Q: No, after the Russians were coming you left.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t remember that, Mm, mm. Mm, mm.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "Q: So you\u2019re gone.",
        "A: My grandfather in between had been trying to locate Dr. Gruen\u2019s orphanage.",
        "Q: For your sister.",
        "A: Mm hm. And nothing at that point and then we went to our first I guess our second DP camp.\nAnd what I remember was that grandma took one look and she said no we\u2019re not staying here.\nTurned out that a girl had died of TB in one of the beds and so grandma wasn\u2019t going to stay\nthere no matter what. Then we went to another DP camp and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know the names. And if you don\u2019t ok.",
        "A: And there was a fire.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re three years old.",
        "A: Pm probably older. At this point I\u2019m older probably four or five. Probably four at least. So\nit\u2019s 45. Mm hm. I don\u2019t remember exactly when the war is over, but I\u2019m at least, yeah I\u2019m five.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of hearing that the war was over or did that mean anything to you.\nYou were so young.",
        "A: I was so young anything could be, because what I, I have vague memories but they\u2019re of\nstores and you know that it looks like almost a washboard and the stores were \u2014",
        "Q: You pull it down?",
        "A: Yeah were all like that and I remember the streets being torn up and boulders here and there.\nGrandma says that I, she was with me. I have no idea where this was but probably where that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\napartment was where we were living. And that she was with me and she saw, we saw a truck go\nby with blood and bodies and blood oozing and that she fainted and she was holding me and I\nfell to the ground and broke my nose for the first time. So I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t\nremember that at all. I remember her tell, she told me that. Well I do remember lots of broken\nbuildings. I remember people kind of frantic. I remember, I remember a man and a woman and a\nlittle girl and they were going very fast and everybody was frowning and this little girl was\ntrying to keep up. I remember watching that.\nI don\u2019t know where that was but I remember that. Then we moved as I say, to this third DP\ncamp. I have no idea where it was. I have no idea. That\u2019s the one where we were asleep at night\nand suddenly grandma smelled smoke and woke us all up and the barrack we were in was on\nfire. So we got out with our pajamas. And we had a suitcase that was filled with I guess some\nold fur coats and some gold and that \u2014",
        "Q: When you say we \u2014",
        "A: Grandpa and grandma. Yeah we were all together and you know it had meats and fur coats\nand they all burned out. And so we were left with our pajamas period. And then the next thing I\nknow we were in our final DP camp which I do remember. And I was told how we got there.\nIgnacio -- oh let me think of his last name. It\u20191l1 come to me in a moment. But anyway he had\nbeen a friend of grandpa\u2019s and he ran this particular DP camp in Linz Austria. And it was called\nCamp Taylor in Wegscheid. And I found out it was called Camp Taylor when I looked at my so\ncalled birth certificate.",
        "Q: Do you know who the Taylor was?",
        "A: Somebody American probably. No, no idea. And I remember being there. And I remember\nwe lived in one room of like an army barracks. Every family got a room. And we gota\ngalvanized tub and when we could find wood or something to make fires we could have hot\ndrinks and a bath once a week. And the bath was with lye soap and kerosene. Because of the lice\nto try to prevent lice. And the bathrooms were like wooden privies all in a row together at one\nside. And in this camp there was a schul where we went every week for Friday night services\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nand all day Saturday. And I remember I had, I was kind of a ring leader and I was always\nclimbing trees and whatever, whatever.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of other children there?",
        "A: There were other children, yes, there were other children. Mm hm, mm hm. And \u2014",
        "Q: What language were you speaking? Polish?",
        "A: It depended. Mainly Polish but grandpa was hospitalized in the Alps. He said it was for his\nheart, but the translator and I probably agree it was a psychiatric hospital. Probably that he was\nsent to and this was well after the war. In the Alps. And what I remember is grandma and I going\nto visit him in one of those chairs like a ski lift kind of thing. And grandma holding on to me for\nall she was worth. And me feeling hey grandma let go. But so yeah. I remember grandpa being\nthere. And we ran black market sugar and when grandpa left I had to do it because grandma\ncouldn\u2019t read or write in any language or really figure. So \u2014",
        "Q: How did you know how to read and write?",
        "A: I went to a school, Hebrew school yes.",
        "Q: In the DP camp?",
        "A: Mmhm. Mmhm. Where I got smacked because I was left handed. That was a sign of the\ndevil. So I kept getting my hand smacked. But according to grandpa I was so smart and you\nknow more. But that of course is my grandpa. So anyway I do remember I had a little dog.\nGrandma sided with me and we got a dog. Oh first.\nGrandpa wanted to marry grandma. Cause she did love him very much. And she had saved our\nlives and he had asked her if he could give her money and she said no. My life is with you and\nwith Jula and all. So in order to convert the rabbi said ok but she would have to shave her head\nand go into the mikvah. And I remember grandma saying, Isaac, I have so little hair, and I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nremember sometimes when grandpa made up his mind you didn\u2019t mess with grandpa. And he\nwent to the rabbi and he said look, Lucia wants to become a Jew. She does us great, great proud\nby wanting to become a Jew. She doesn\u2019t want to shave her head. She will not shave her head.\nAnd the rabbi, ok, Isaac she won\u2019t shave her head, all right, all right. So grandpa became Jewish.\nI mean grandma. Became Jewish and became Leah I guess, although nobody ever called her\nLeah. Later she dubbed herself Lucy cause she watched I Love Lucy. But it was Lucia Noviska\nEisen. So can we stop for a little bit.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We would hide the sugar. It would serve as pillows in this huge bed that grandpa, grandma\nand I all slept in.",
        "Q: These are bags of sugar.",
        "A: Yes, great big bags of sugar and whenever the police came to look around and so forth, I was,\nit was my duty to be in bed.",
        "Q: Sleep on the sugar.",
        "A: I'd sleep on the sugar, right. So that\u2019s -- I remember that. I remember my grandfather\nworked in a matzah making kind of oven there in lager. We called DP camp lager. And I\nremember we had Purim plays and this and that. And I remember where I\u2019d take the little dog to\nschul. I'd try to stay out of the way of the men who would, if they could get close enough would\nsmack you. So you had to kind of make sure you were running fast enough and avoid the\nsmacks, with my little team of cohorts.\nAnd then we\u2019d go outside schul and make mud pies and things like that. And in the winter\ngrandma would wrap me in rags and everything and there was a huge hill that was like a hole\nand not a hill, 1t was a hole. A huge hole that was dug there and we kids would go sledding there.\nAnd to me I\u2019d walk around that, the parameters of this hole and that was where God was. And so\nI remember always asking for my baby sister. I wanted my baby sister. And God to me, at that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\npoint, was like a puppeteer and there were wars and things went wrong because people were like\nmarionettes and the strings would get tangled, so that\u2019s what I remember.\nI remember walking with my grandfather once and taking his hand and asking him grandpa,\nwhere are my parents? And he said oh they\u2019re they went on a trip, they\u2019re far away. I said Jaju\nthey\u2019re never coming back, are they. And he looked at me and I saw these huge tears, fat\nteardrops coming from his eyes. And he was not a man who cried easily. And I knew that was\nnot a question to ask any more and I knew they were dead.\nAnd I remember once not far from the bunk we were in, there was a huge tree and there were\ntwin brothers. They were either late teens or early 20s. They seemed aged, very aged to me at the\ntime, but that\u2019s how old they probably were, 18 to 21. And they were standing by the tree and\nlightning struck and they died. They were killed and I remember seeing that. And, and that was\npretty scary.\nAnd we got a care package in lager and it was said that I was going to be leaving so everybody in\nlager decided that this new plastic raincoat should go to me. Now mind you I was all of seven\nand this was an adult raincoat but nonetheless Jula had to have it. So I was so proud, this blue\nplastic raincoat. And then what I heard later was that grandpa had tried to get us into Palestine,\nthe three of us and then eventually he tried to get us into Israel because remember 1n 48 Israel\nwas not accepting and Palestine didn\u2019t want any old, old people and orphan children. So we\nwere living a pretty difficult existence so grandpa thought it would be best if he sent me to the\nStates. And my Tante Siegel sponsored me and what I remember is passing a place with a huge\nmetal fence, very high metal fence. And I remember children at one side of it, the other side\nclinging to that fence and looking at us.\nAnd I said Jaju promise me you\u2019|l never put me there, promise. And he promised. And then I\nwas there and because he had made -- he had decided to send me to America. And I had to go\nthrough a series of orphanages and they were Catholic orphanages or something cause I\nremember nuns and that was one of them. And \u2014",
        "Q: Why did you have to go through the series?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "Q: To prove that you were an orphan?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I know that grandpa -- let\u2019s see. Yeah. I\nremember it seemed like forever that I was in these \u2014",
        "Q: Orphanages.",
        "A: Mm hm. And I remember being very, very sad and crying and apparently the nuns were very\nworried that I was going to die because I wasn\u2019t eating. I wasn\u2019t, I was just kind of fading away.\nSo they called my grandfather or contacted him some kind of way. And he and grandma came\nand he brought me a china doll which was the first toy I'd ever had because the only toys I had\nknown were origami soldiers made out of newspapers on horses, also made out of newspapers\nthat grandpa and I would play.\nAnd so I had this doll and not only was she a doll, she had eyes that opened and closed. Yep.\nAnd he also brought a bag of oranges. And that was incredibly much of a huge, huge big deal.\nAnd he found one of the older girls and he asked her if she would take care of me on the way to\nAmerica and she said yes. Grandpa gave the oranges, some to her and some to the nun, nuns.\nAnd (pause) I remember feeling very sad. But this girl was very nice and she would do my hair\nand she would try to, she just was there. I don\u2019t remember her name or anything. I Just remember\nshe was nice. And I remember that was \u2014 the ship we came on. We slept in hammocks. Ok and\nthere were four of them. And I was the youngest so I was on the bottom one.",
        "Q: What was your name then?",
        "A: Jula.",
        "Q: Still?",
        "A: Mm hm. Jula Weinstock Eisen. And then I had a terrible toothache because I grew up on\nAmerican Coca Cola which was the big thing and if it was American it had to be wonderful. So\nI, that\u2019s what I lived on. Well I had terribly rotten teeth. I had a horrible toothache. And I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nremember the nun giving me oil of cloves or putting oil of cloves on me so I smelled like oil of\ncloves. Then we were on the ship.",
        "Q: What was the name of the ship?",
        "A: The General Bumbe. I always thought that it was in December that I came to the States but\nwhen I read in the manifest it said November 14\". I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when it sailed or that\u2019s\nwhen we landed. And I don\u2019t know where we landed.",
        "Q: In 1948\u201d?",
        "A: Unh hunh. I do remember, I thought it was Baltimore. That\u2019s what I remember, Baltimore.\nAnd what I do remember, and some of these I\u2019ve written about was ladies coming with little\nAmerican flags to give us American flags. Later I found out they were the DAR. And I\nremember one lady coming up to me and talking to me and giving me my flag and I had no idea\nwhat she was saying because the English I knew was taught to me by an American soldier. And I\ncould count, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That was the extent of my\nEnglish.\nSo what I didn\u2019t understand the woman spoke louder. And she screamed in my ear and I\nremember thinking, why do all Americans yell. And I couldn\u2019t believe it. But then I remember\nthe nuns getting us on a bus and I said to the nun. I was very thirsty. And she gave me an orange\nand that didn\u2019t slack my thirst at all. But then I remember sleeping and it seemed like forever\nand then arriving at a soot covered brick building in New York. And what I loved about that\nbuilding was it had a marble staircase. And like Tevya, I loved running up and down those stairs\nbecause I loved the sound that marble made. And they also had sweetheart soap. Well that was\nthe first time I had smelled soap that smelled, didn\u2019t smell like tar and it was -- I kept washing\nmy hands. And that was glorious. And I remember coming down the stairs one day and I\nremember this woman at the bottom talking to the nun. And what I heard and it was in German\nwas she can\u2019t be Isaac\u2019s granddaughter. Isaac is so handsome. And then look at that hair. I bet\nshe has lice. And that was my introduction to my Aunt Helen.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nGail Schwartz: This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Julie Keefer. This is track number two and you were talking\nabout coming to the United States and then coming, your aunt was downstairs discussing you.\nJulie Keefer: But first I\u2019m going to just back track a little bit. The nuns I remember, one of the\nnuns taking me to a park somewhere in New York. And in the park, I saw a little girl, probably\naround my age. I was seven. And I looked at her and I figured out how it was that Americans\ncould make those strange sounds. Like three and through because they had special throats. And\nthose throats came out and because I had never seen bubble gum before. And this girl was\nblowing a bubble.",
        "Q: She was blowing her throat out.",
        "A: Yes, to make those funny sounds, mm hm. So I remember that. And now I\u2019m back with Aunt\nSiegel. No, Aunt Helen. Aunt Helen Fichtenbaum was my grandfather\u2019s youngest sibling.\nAnd she shared a house with her older sister Rosa who was widowed. And Rosa had a daughter\nElaine Yeta, who was 16. And Aunt Helen had a daughter Perry, who was 12. And a husband,\nDick. And they lived in half of a duplex in a very Orthodox section of Brooklyn. And the first\nday that I remember was Aunt Helen taking me to their bathroom and cutting my hair, because\nshe was very sure that I had lice, so she cut my hair which made me cry because I was so proud\nof not having lice. It was a big thing. And then I was a student at the local elementary school\nwhere the only teacher in the school who spoke any language I did was the kindergarten teacher\nwho spoke German.",
        "Q: What language by that old age of seven did you know?",
        "A: Oh I knew a little bit of Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, German. And Ukrainian.",
        "Q: You knew Russian?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: A little bit, very little. And so I went to the local school and the children called me retard\nbecause I was tall for my age and here I was in kindergarten at age seven. And seven and a half.\nAnd they also called me Nazi because the language I spoke was German. And Aunt Helen was a\nvery troubled woman and it was very hard for her to take this child who had come from a war\ntorn country and who was a granddaughter of this absent older brother that she idealized. And I\nwas not a pretty child at all. And so she didn\u2019t know quite what to do with me. She was a little\noverwhelmed. Her daughter Perry was allergic to everything and Perry and I shared a room.\nAnd I just remember being truly, truly unhappy and waiting. I couldn\u2019t wait for the weekends\nwhen I would go see Tante Siegel. Tante Siegel was my father\u2019s aunt. And she is the one who\nsponsored my coming to America. She lived in the Bronx in, on the third floor of a walk up. In\na one bedroom apartment. This one bedroom apartment, as you walked in the door you looked\ndirectly at some French doors covered by lace curtains that were the entrance to the bedroom.\nAnd otherwise you saw a sofa, a couple of chairs and a black telephone and a glass bottle near\nthe telephone where everyone who wanted to make a call had to put in a nickel.\nThen there were tzedakah boxes all over the place and they were blue with white Jewish stars on\nthem. They were all for some cause or other in Israel. For yeshivas, for trees, for whatever.\nAnd Tante Siegel herself was about four foot ten with huge round blue eyes. High cheekbones, a\nClara Bow mouth and a very, very pretty face. Blondish gray hair. Her brother, Uncle Charlie,\nalso was short but a little taller than she. And I met him a little afterwards and he had a farm in\nthe Adirondacks that he had apparently sold the farm. He had had five daughters. He and his\nwife Sophie had five daughters. Like Tevya. And no sons. So he sold the farm but kept the\nbungalow which was a house. And there was a man-made lake and I remember Uncle Charlie\ndriving me in this beat up black car over these hairpin turns at what seemed like umpteen miles\nan hour. Well of course it wasn\u2019t. But I remember Uncle Charlie\u2019s huge hands. He had these\nhand with large knuckles and when I first saw Van Gogh\u2019s the Potato Eaters, I could always\nremember Uncle Charlie cause that\u2019s what he looked like, his hands looked like.\nWell back to Aunt Helen -- Tante Siegel and her apartment. There was a window. On the door\nwas \u2014 the window was on the left and I remember I would sit at that window for hours and hours\nand hours and just look out and just look out. There, it was all concrete. There was some kind of\na basketball court. You know concrete playground with a high fence, metal fence around it and I\nwould watch people play. And I remember feeling very sad. But Tante Siegel was very, very\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nwarm. And her husband Uncle Jake, was a little taller than she. Huge, beak like nose, but Uncle\nJake almost never spoke. He was like a shadow. So we never knew what he was thinking or\nwhatever. He just was there. He might as well have been invisible. But I loved those times at\nTante Siegel\u2019s.\nTante Siegel had two children. She had Marvin who was in the army, very good looking and I\nonly saw his pictures. And she had Adele who was married to Sid Roman. And they were\nsupposed to move to an apartment on the other side of the third floor but it wasn\u2019t ready. So they\nwere staying with Tante Siegel. Had to pull out something. So to say there was no room in this\napartment. So the Joint wouldn\u2019t let me live there. And, but I loved going there. And I heard\nfrom my cousin Sid, many years later he had given me a huge teddy bear which he had won at a\nfair and he was going to give it to their first child. But he said, you looked so sad and needy there\nthat I thought maybe I better give it to you. So he gave it to me. And I, very imaginative child,\nnamed this teddy bear, Louka, which means doll in Polish. But oh I loved that teddy bear. And\nthat was a happy time. And Tante Siegel would have a yummy brunch every Sunday with white\nfish and sable, and lox and bagels and cheeses and tomatoes and all kinds of yummy stuff,\nalways milchig. And I would be doing dishes and I inevitably used the wrong dish towel. And\nwe had to go find a place that had any dirt in Bronx New York. But that was a challenge. So that\nwas Tante Siegel.\nI remember once Aunt Rosa who always looked unbelievably chic. She had a black chignon.\nI\u2019m sure she died her hair but she was very regal looking, in contrast to her sister Aunt Helen\nwho always looked bedraggled and harried. In shapeless housedresses which were ugly. Never\nsmiled. Anyway Aunt, Tante Rosa worked outside the home. And one day she took me out for\nlunch and to buy me a new skirt. And the skirt, I remember was gray but it was kind of full, had\nbig pockets with blue trim on the pocket, the top part of the pocket. And I thought it was\ngorgeous. And I wore it back to Aunt Helen\u2019s and I remember her yelling in the kitchen where\nAunt Helen was yelling and saying why did you take that brat? Why didn\u2019t you take Perry? She\ndeserves it. That brat doesn\u2019t deserve anything. I don\u2019t know what Isaac and that woman were\nthinking of. And I decided that I wouldn\u2019t wear the skirt by Aunt Helen because all it did was get\nTante Rosa in trouble. So I would only wear it at Tante Siegel\u2019s.\nWell, one day I remembered, I was still a bit of a ring leader and Perry was very, very shy and I\nremember saying to Perry, let\u2019s go visit Yeta\u2019s room, Elaine, at that time she was called Elaine\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nroom. So her room was in the very front of the house and it had one of those satiny bedspreads\nthat I -- quilted satin, and all these cologne bottles on a blond mirrored dresser which I thought\nwas so gorgeous. And they all smelled so good. So I remember that was just a whole new world.\nYeta was a -- Elaine wasn\u2019t thrilled that these two younger went to her room but I think she\nforgave us eventually but I remember that was so pretty.\nI just remember Aunt Helen saying that well if you\u2019re good I'll show you a picture of your\ngrandpa when, in his soldier uniform which I had never seen him so I was -- I tried to be so\ngood. And I was never quite good enough. So I never did see that picture. And I guess I must\nhave been there for eight or nine months. And it was a very, very difficult time. Probably for\neveryone. But I remember it being very difficult for me.\nAnd I remember the social worker from the Joint coming. The first time and I was warned that I\nwas to tell her that I was being treated beautifully and that I was very happy. And the second\ntime she came, I didn\u2019t care and I told her I hate it here. And that I was fed with -- like a dog.\nFood was left in front of the bedroom. That I was a pretty awful person and ugh. Um. The\nsocial worker said Julie, we\u2019re going to send you to the country. You\u2019re going to go where you'll\nsee chickens and cows and other children. And I thought wow, that\u2019s pretty great. I didn\u2019t want\nto leave Tante Siegel cause I adored her. So that was pretty sad, leaving her. But I -- someone\nput me in a pretty new pink dress. And I remember it had belts that tied in the back, with some\nflowers on it. I was eight years old and I was put on an airplane. And told that someone in\nBellefaire would meet me at the other end. In Cleveland. And so I was being sent to Bellefaire\nJewish children\u2019s home for problem children. And it was in Shaker Heights, Ohio. (laughs) No\nchickens, no cows, children yes. (laughs)\nBut there were cottages which were brick buildings and we were assigned in cottages by gender.\nAnd by age. And I was put in the little kids\u2019 cottage when I first came which was run by Aviva\nand Chaim Orlen who were an Israeli couple and they were, they were very nice. I remember \u2014\nwhat I remember is at night getting this horrible medicine, codfish liver oil and other stuff. That\nwas sweet. And then we\u2019d get one of those Mallomar cookies with milk. Well that was so\ndelicious. I also remember a little girl there named Tanya. Although she was older than I, she\nwas almost a head shorter.\nAnd I remember that my teddy bear had no eyes. The eyes had been removed. I don\u2019t know\nwhat ever happened to the china doll. I don\u2019t remember but I remember that my teddy bear who I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nloved had lost his eyes. And I suspected that it was Tanya. I remember this so clearly. I said\nTanya if you tell me the truth, I won\u2019t hit you. So she told me the truth. Yeah, she did it. And I\nthought that, was that stupid of me or not. Why did I say I wouldn\u2019t hit her. I was mad. But at\nleast she told the truth. (sigh)",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with your grandfather at that point? No?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t come to this country until 1951.",
        "Q: Ok. So how long did you stay in this children\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Til I was 14 and a half.",
        "Q: You stayed there, in this children\u2019s home in Shaker Heights.",
        "A: It was Bellefaire. It was run by Fritz Mayer who was a cohort of Bruno Bettelheim\u2019s whereas\nBruno Bettelheim believed in psychoanalysis, Fritz Mayer believed in milieu therapy. So the\nBellefaire was run on milieu therapy kind of thing where we had all kinds of activities. We had\nwoodshop, we had art. We had Miss Sugar and story hour and lots of books in the library and I\nloved reading and apparently that was my escape.\nAnd I was afraid of loud noises, uniforms and playing hide and seek.",
        "Q: Did you talk about the war at all?",
        "A: I had a series of social workers until one day I said I\u2019m not going to talk to you anymore\nbecause you\u2019re just going to leave like all the others and Bellefaire decided to put me on a trial\nwith University Hospital, Hannah House and they sent me to a child analyst, Marian Barnes. And\nI saw Ms. Barnes for many years. She was really special. And I remember sitting on this great\nhorsehair sofa in the waiting room of Hannah house, picturing what Ms. Barnes would look like.\nAnd she would be beautiful with dark hair and -- well I went into the office where she was and\nshe was middle aged, gray hair, kind of round. Old. And she said, Julie or Julia. I was called\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nJulia at this point, I can\u2019t be your mother, but I can be like a favorite aunt. And in fact she was.\nWhen I was in talent shows, Ms. Barnes was always there. She gave me my tiny tears doll who\nwet and had \u2014 cried real tears. And my first bicycle. And when I was singing Frankie and\nJohnny at the talent show and looking straight up at the ceiling cause I was so nervous, she was\nsitting there in the audience clapping. Ms. Barnes was I think what kept me going for a long\ntime. And did I talk about the war? Yes. I talked about my dreams. I talked about \u2014 yeah, I\ntalked about a lot of things with Ms. Barnes.\nMeanwhile we had various social \u2014 various cottage parents. We had cottage parents during the\nday, cottage parents at night and like permanent couple who lived with us. And I remember I\nwas put in the big girls\u2019 cottage. I think I was ten. When my grandparents came I was close to\n11. And I have some pictures there. And I remember I didn\u2019t remember my Polish. Just English.\nGrandpa\u2019s shoes squeaked when he walked. And I remember grandpa and grandma and I going\nto the Fairmont theater, walking. And I remember being a little bit distant from my grandfather,\ngrandmother. And Ms. Barnes informed me that I had acted like a brat. (laughs) and I said yeah.",
        "Q: But you had remembered them?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah I remembered them. But part of what was going on -- Bupsha I told you had been\ntortured and sometimes she was not totally rational. And she said that I was so horrible that even\nmy grandfather didn\u2019t\u2019 want me around. That\u2019s why he sent me away. And I believed that. And\num (pause) um, I was also upset with my grandfather and also feeling terribly guilty because my\ntime with his sister was awful. So I felt ambivalent about that visit. Very. It was also at \u2014 you\nwant me to stop.",
        "Q: No, no I was just \u2014",
        "A: How much time?",
        "Q: As much as you need. I was going to say how long did you stay in Bellefaire, til what age?",
        "A: 14.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "Q: 14. And then?",
        "A: I went to my first foster home and then stayed there for six months and went to my second\nfoster home and that\u2019s where I was adopted.",
        "Q: Oh you were adopted? Was it in Cleveland?",
        "A: With phenomenal parents.",
        "Q: Really, and their names?",
        "A: Fred and Tea Klejstadt. And they were unbelievable people. And I was so, so lucky.\nUnbelievably lucky. I met them first, Fritz Mayer didn\u2019t believe in our being institutionalized so\nwe had big sisters, big brothers to take us out. And I met the Klejstadts with three other girls.\nThey took us out for a picnic and I remember thinking how beautiful Tea was and sweet and how\nspecial I felt around her. Fred I thought was nice but I, she was warmth itself. And I had a very\ndear friend in Bellefaire whose name was Joyce. And we were assigned permanent big sisters,\nbig brothers. And I was assigned to Nussensens who were lovely warm large Jewish family\nwith two sons. The younger son had some mental health issues and I adored them both. They\nwere like little brothers and they were just special. And Flo and Manny Nussensen were warm as\nwarm could be. And I was just included in everything which was neat cause I was kind of a shy,\ndream, dreamy child who, who read all the time. And I drew a lot and painted. At Bellefaire I\nhad an art teacher who had no thumbs and he was a phenomenal man. And I learned a great deal\nfrom him. He\u2019s black and one of my favorite counselors was black. And I mention that because\nwe were going to Parma tubing which 1s a special lake with all kinds of stuff in Cleveland. We\nwere on a big bus with this counselor and Fritz Mayer and we got to Parma tubing and someone\ncame up and said oh no, we don\u2019t allow Negroes here. And so I remember Fritz Mayer puffing\nhimself out. Zis will not go on. Come, children, get in the bus. So if you don\u2019t\u2019 take one of us,\nyou take none of us. So we all left.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nBut this counselor was wonderful because one, we used to give plays for July fourth. And she\nhad Paul Robeson, Ballad for the Americans. And so I went to her house to hear it. And I was\nusually the star or whatever so she wanted me to listen to it. And I remember that was special.\nAnd then we had a cottage parents who were Mormon and he was getting his degree, advanced\ndegree in chemistry. So he used to make our shampoos. They were smelly, ugh. But I suppose\nthey were good. And his wife was just a sweetie pie. They used to play folk music and a lot of\nLeadbelly. So I grew up on Leadbelly.",
        "Q: You stayed at with the family the Klejstadts and then went to \u2014",
        "A: Never stayed with them. I just went on that picnic with them and I was back to Bellefaire and\nI was in elementary school and at Andrew Jackson Rikoff where the teachers stayed in their\nrooms and students went to different teachers for different subjects. And I had a math teacher.\nThis was sixth grade. Oh, fourth grade was my first experience at Andrew Jackson Rikoff. Well\nfirst I went to a very elegant school, elementary school, third grade near Bellefaire. And the\nteacher thought I was retarded because I wrote things backwards. And she wanted us to have\nfresh handkerchiefs pinned on us. And at Bellefaire we had these sewing ladies who would redo\nclothes so they would fit us and stuff. So I went up and I asked for a hankie and they gave me a\nbox of Kleenex. They said this is much more sanitary. So I came in with my box of Kleenex and\nteacher was sure I was definitely retarded so Bellefaire decided to test me. So I remember having\na battery of tests. They decided no, I wasn\u2019t retarded. And but they also decided I was artistic.\nThat Julie needed piano lessons. Well we had one piano and it was in the playroom and I was in\nthe big girls\u2019 cottage now. Well Julie, Julie had to practice. Julia. No one was allowed in the\nplayroom when Julia had to practice. Makes you instantly popular doesn\u2019t it?\nI decided I don\u2019t\u2019 want piano lessons so my piano teacher and I started talking about African\nviolets and she taught me to knit instead which was great. But I remained very interested in art.\nAnd anyway, I\u2019m \u2014",
        "Q: Can we move on. Then you went to high school.",
        "A: No, then I went to um,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "Q: TO get to your high school years and then on to college.",
        "A: Then I went to my first foster home.",
        "Q: Right and you stayed six months. And then you went to a second \u2014",
        "A: Well I had met my parents when I was on that outing when I was 11. And they decided then\nthey wanted to adopt me. And I had a hard time with that. Didn\u2019t want to be adopted. Took me a\nlong time to figure out who I was and didn\u2019t want to change it.\nUm, so I saw Ms. Barnes again to decide whether I would be adopted or not. And she helped.\nAnd my grandfather was very against it. At this time they were in the States and I was to go see\nthem every summer. I couldn\u2019t live with them because they lived in some pretty awful slums\nand the Joint didn\u2019t think that that was safe. Then when I went to my parents, it was my mother\nwas an artist. And I guess, I loved art and it was like wow, and my father loved having a\ndaughter. And it was amazing to me because he was very, very educated, well-educated man\nwho did not take to fools lightly. He had a PhD. And yet I could you know if I were taking\nFrench, we\u2019d speak French at the table so that Julie could practice. So he was very special. And\nthey both were. And we became very, very close.\nAnd my grandfather eventually met my parents. Although he didn\u2019t understand adoption. He\nthought it was a form of white slavery. So I had him come and meet them. And he fell in love\nwith my mother. He thought she was like his daughter and my father was a good business man\nand that he was very thrilled about. So I was adopted. I skipped a year of high school because\nfrankly I didn\u2019t want to take math. I was terrible in math and at that time, they gave you tests in\nEnglish and history and if you did well, you were put in top track. And top track meant that you\nhad to have physics and you had to have advanced, advanced math. So I wanted to skip a year\nand skip that. So I did.\nAnd I graduated and my father, I said I\u2019m not going to college. And my father said um, well it\u2019s\nnot a question of going or not going. It\u2019s a question of which college. So I said well I want to go\nto Sarah Lawrence and my mother said well because I had met a girl who looked like a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nRembrandt painting and with her red hair and everything and she went to Sarah Lawrence so I\nwanted to go there.\nMy mother said honey, you know you might want to go someplace that\u2019s coed where you\u2019d be\nwith both boys and girls. So I also wanted to go to the University of Chicago. So my father took\nme down and did not like Hyde Park at all, at all, at all and said mm, mm. You\u2019re too young to\nbe in this. Meanwhile I had got early admittance to Antioch and I went to see Antioch. I just\nturned 16. But I couldn\u2019t handle that much freedom. So I said I can\u2019t handle that much freedom.\nMy father said well I have this idea. There\u2019s a school that\u2019s close to us and I would like you to\ncheck it out for your cousin Suzanne because not only 1s it a good liberal arts school but it has a\ngood conservatory for your cousin. So I\u2019d like a young person\u2019s opinion. I said ok, Pll go with\nyou. Went with him. Next thing I know, I\u2019ve got an appointment with Dean Jackson, dean of\nadmissions and Dean Jackson said you know introduces himself. And my father is sitting there\nand I said actually Dean Jackson you don\u2019t want to take me because I did ok on the English part\nbut on the math part. He said yeah I see. Did you just write your name and then turn it in. I said\n\u2014 he said yeah, hm. He said well you know you didn\u2019t have your three years of high school math\nto get in so you\u2019d have to have your third year of math to get out. But yeah they decided they\nwould take me.\nSo my father \u2014 I said take me. We\u2019re looking at this for my cousin and Julie you know we just\nadopted you and you\u2019ve been with us so little and Oberlin is only an hour away and we\u2019d like to\nbe close to you. And I said ok. And I went to classes and I felt so comfortable because I had gone\nto Miami, University of Miami, Miami University in Ohio and I hated it. People were nice\nenough but I was doing a crossword puzzle and suddenly I was an egghead. And unh, unh, I\u2019d\nhad enough of that. At high school. I just wanted a chance just to be me.\nAnd at Oberlin I could be me. And I loved that and I just, so that\u2019s why I went to Oberlin and\nkept changing majors. And then junior year when you had to declare your major, I had most\nhours in French and art. And studio art was a very long major and so I decided I would go for\nFrench. And I had met Larry when he was a senior and I was a junior living at French house.\nAnd he went to the University of New Hampshire for graduate school in chemistry. And he\nasked me to marry him which is also a funny story.\nI called my father to tell him that I was engaged. This is my senior year. I was, Daddy, \u2019'm\nengaged. You\u2019re what? I\u2019m engaged Daddy. Quiet, the silence. He didn\u2019t ask me. Daddy he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\ndoesn\u2019t want to marry you. That fell really like a bomb. And then Larry wasn\u2019t Jewish. And my\nparents were upset about this. Everybody was upset about it. And but Larry was an amazing,\namazing, iS an amazing man.",
        "Q: So you got married and then where did you live, just kind of summarize.",
        "A: And then we lived in Durham, New Hampshire while Larry finished his degree and I taught\nFrench and Spanish at the local high school. Then for two years. Then I had Steve and you could\nnot teach if you were pregnant at that time. And the, then when Steve was close to a year, we left\nand went to Chicago, Larry\u2019s first job. We stayed in Chicago for three and a half years and then,\nwell three years. Then moved to Omaha, Nebraska and that\u2019s where our daughter was born and\nshe had a naming ceremony and Larry decided that he also wanted to convert at that. He had\ntaken the course in Chicago from Rabbi Devine who had them read God, Jews and History by\nMax Dimont. And Larry thought, great this is my thing. So he decided to convert and when he\nwas asked ok so you'll be Abraham. He said no, I don\u2019t want to be Abraham, I want to Moshe.\nSo they said ok be Moshe, so that\u2019s why you see the various Moses\u2019s over there. And so that\u2019s,\nwe lived in Nebraska where Larry worked at the University of -- at a research place for cancer\nresearch. That was a part of the University of Nebraska Medical School.\nThen we came down here where -- oh and I got a few more degrees in Omaha. I had substitute\ntaught in Chicago where if you could breathe and walk, they told you, you could teach. And then\nI realized that I needed much more training to deal with kids with problems which I enjoyed.\nAnd so when we got here I was going to go on in that field, and that\u2019s what I did.",
        "Q: Talk a little bit about some of your thoughts. When you were raising your children, when\nyour children were first born even, did that influence, did it bring back memories of what you\nwent through. Your childhood was so very different than theirs. Did it influence how you raised\nyour children, do you think because of what you had gone through? And the trauma and the\nchallenges that you had?",
        "A: (pause) I think in a way it certainly influenced our son. Because I had made a big, big thing\nof having him have a bar mitzvah. Grandpa wanted to live to see his great grandson bar\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nmitzvahed. Great, great, I guess hunh. And so I put some pressure on Steve to have the bar\nmitzvah and he had a hard time with that one. And I had grandpa\u2019s diary translated. And I think\nit was a lot for him to deal with being the son of a survivor cause it kind of fell on him. And I\nthink the family hero was grandpa who started a resistance and all of that. Steve eventually\njoined the rangers, the airborne rangers and I think that\u2019s partially why.\nSo I think yes, to some extent, but mm. I was worried about the kind of parent I would be\nbecause my grandma was at times very difficult and I didn\u2019t want to be like that. But I had lots\nand lots of help as I was growing up and I had lots of people who were very important to me. I\nwas very blessed in that.\nSo (sigh) I think I got demonstrations of how to love very well.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through the terrible times \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Other people were living.",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. I think what I do deal with is big time is survivor guilt. And that you\nknow is the baggage that you try to move around and move around and get rid of. You don\u2019t get\nrid of it but you can move it around. But no, no. not at all. If your question is did I derive, you\nsaid people having a so called easier life than I did. No. Because I feel that pain is also very\npersonal. How do you compare people\u2019s pain? And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to com \u2014 you know to\nsay this person\u2019s pain is greater than this.\nOne thing I did have great difficulty with. When I went to, I told you I went to Israel last with\nRabbis for human rights. It was an outstanding trip but it was terribly painful because I had gone\nto Yad Vashem first. I went early and Yad Vashem 1s now very different than it was when I first\nwent there. It\u2019s a huge spread of acres which is interesting because as you walk through it, you\nhave this feeling of freedom and then you come up against one of the railroad cars where you can\nwalk into various \u2014 but this feeling of freedom.\nAnd you know there\u2019s an awful lot of lip service paid to the Holocaust. Never again will we have\nthis. Never again but I have great difficulty because never again but to us. Not necessarily to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nanyone else. And that just really, that hurt my heart. To see what we\u2019re all doing in Israel itself.\nAnd I\u2019m not saying that you know it\u2019s all one sided or whatever, whatever. But oh. Anyway. So\nI had great difficulty with that.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around other survivors?",
        "A: No, no. I\u2019m comfortable around survivors and non survivors.",
        "Q: Are there any sights or sounds or smells in today\u2019s world that triggers memories for you?",
        "A: When we were first living in Chicago, Larry and I, we lived near Michael Reese hospital and\nthere were always sirens, sirens and sirens used to terrify me. And so Larry said to me one day,\nwell but Julie think of it this way. These are all pregnant women going to have babies. Well it\nworked. (laughs) And I would smilingly think of all these pregnant ladies going to have babies.\nYeah, it was wonderful, yep.",
        "Q: Any other sights or sounds or smells that trigger memories for you?",
        "A: Yeah. When we were in California we went to Hirsh Park to hear a concert, live concert.\nThat\u2019s where the Nazis, neo-Nazis had their headquarters. And I saw them in their uniforms\nmarching around and I was beside myself I was so livid. And I was with my brother in law and\nmy husband and my three year old son. And I broke free from them and I went up to the Nazis\nand I said you are such worthless, worthless people. Well we have the right to believe what \u2014 I\nsaid yes, and you\u2019re doing it in a park that was contributed by Jews. I said hunh and I said I just,\nI think you are such the crap of the earth. And I said and that\u2019s my freedom of speech.",
        "Q: Did you tell them where you came from?",
        "A: No, no, no. but Larry was \u2014 and Jim were ready to save me and so forth. And so on. And \u2014",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Germany?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: I, you know, the first ttme I went to Ger \u2014 no it was actually the second time I went to\nGermany, I had great difficulty. I had come from France and I was to meet Larry in Germany.\nWe were going to go to Freiburg because he had a doctor herr Drochi, who had invented a\nspecial kind of rat for cancer research. And so I was to meet Larry there so we could have a\nvacation also. I had come from France. And I had a glorious time and I was sitting there 1n this\ncar with these French young men who were going to Germany to work. Cause Germany paid\nmuch better wages. And just as we passed the border, the German police came on very, very\nofficious and I got my dander up a bit and I had a big suitcase. And I didn\u2019t understand a word\nthey were saying and I could care less. And the soldiers, the French soldiers said you know\ndon\u2019t make a big issue of this. It\u2019s ok. We\u2019re here for you. We understand. They understood\nnothing but they were lovely.\nAnd so they were gentling me along. And they got the suitcase down. They said there\u2019s nothing\nthere. She\u2019s an American, whatever, whatever. But that was my first taste. And then I got to the\nrailroad station. And I was supposed to meet Larry there. He wasn\u2019t there. And I, there am I\nwith this huge suitcase, no Larry. A man comes up to me cause apparently that\u2019s where you pick\nup prostitutes at the train station. And I didn\u2019t know. So (phone ringing) I \u2014 then Larry came and\nI was furious with Larry. And he had gotten the wrong time that the train was to come in and I\nwas so angry with him.\nThen we had an interesting -- we stayed at the, I called it the rat house. We stayed there and for\na night and then herr doctor Drochi invited us to his apartment. So Larry and I went there and I\nsaw this man who was a caricature. A dueling scar. I think he was wearing a monocle even, I\nthink so. And he kissed my hand and like that was his feat. And I looked at Larry and he said oh\nyou know how nice to meet Larry. He spoke German and French, no English. Nice to meet\nLarry and his French wife. And I said Je ne suis pas Francaise. Je suis Americaine et je suis\njuife [ph]. Just like that cause I thought I am going to clear the air with this jerk. And we\u2019re\nsitting down and he\u2019s giving me the party line. We\u2019re talking the problems with America.\nThey\u2019re all due to miscegenation. All in French. And I\u2019m thinking I can\u2019t believe that this guy\nis still around. He\u2019s a Nazi so and so. And Larry said no, no, no, no. he wouldn\u2019t have this\nposition, Julie. He can\u2019t be a Nazi, no way and when we came back and we were having lunch\nwith Umberto Safiati who was the NIH who is a sweetheart. And Umberto said so how was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nlunch with the Nazi? And Larry said what? He said oh yeah, yeah Drochi was a Nazi. Didn\u2019t\nyou know that Larry? And I said hm. But Larry is so naive. He\u2019s so naive. Yeah, so.",

And I think that (pause) that\u2019s kind of been my\nlife\u2019s work in educational equity and even in you know making even the playing field all the way\naround. And I believe in that. And that probably comes from being a survivor. Why did I,\nuseless me, survive when so many good and fabulous people didn\u2019t? But that isn\u2019t the question\nthat can ever be answered.

        "A: Right. And while we\u2019re hiding in the ghetto, my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he\nescapes from concentration camp and manages to get across a railroad track just as a Nazi\nmunitions train was going. So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they\nshot him in the hand and shot his finger. And he started running away as the train was coming\nby. And of course they did not dare fire at that train because there would be a massive\nexplosion. Ok. Then while he was running this was in a woods, a very deep woods in Lvov. And\nhe met a peasant named Mr. Borecki. And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather\u2019s\ndiary. Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was\na very big man and no shoes could fit him. So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and\nhad him sleep in the barn and gave him three breads.\nAnd my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --. He said well Pll just leave my barn\ndoor open. Then if I get asked, I could say I don\u2019t know who sleeps in my barn. So my\ngrandfather did that and the next day he left. And when he was in the woods, oh and he was\ngiven a shovel. And in the woods, he was sitting there. And suddenly he heard two or three men\nspeaking Yiddish. And they had escaped an aktion, very near this woods. And one of them had a\ngun. And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess\nbecause he looked good on a horse. The Polish cavalry.\nHe did. And I think that\u2019s why they took him. But anyway, so he was -- they made him the\nleader. They dug this tunnel and that\u2019s the one that I called the bunker. Ok, it\u2019s a tunnel in this\nwoods, yes. And \u2014",
        "A: Quite a ways I think. Because this was in the woods and the ghetto \u2014 now, I'll describe the\nbunker in just a moment. But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two\nthings. One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki\u2019s son had been killed by the Nazis.\nBecause he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance. Now but before then he had told his\nfather that the Nazis were going to bomb the ghetto very soon. So my grandfather knew that it\nwas just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives.\nOk. Now I\u2019m going to switch back and tell you about the bunker.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nThe bunker to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud. And there was a ladder to go in\nand as I remember it, it seemed very tall. Probably it was no more than six feet. And as you\nwalked around, you felt this cold, wet mud. And at one side, here was the entrance. Then there\nwas this cold wet mud. And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a table, like the\nkind that electric wire comes on, those spool tables. And I just, I remember it feeling splintery.\nAnd I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that table.\nAnd then again some more wet mud. Then like an archway out of mud again and a separate\nroom. On the, as you walked into that room, on the left were things that I later found out were\nguns. And rifles. What I, and how I, I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather\nsmacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand. And\nthat\u2019s when I realized those were dangerous.\nI don\u2019t remember the people in the tunnel. Now I\u2019m going to switch back and tell you.\nEventually there were 37 people in the tunnel. But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis\nwere going to bomb the ghetto he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men\nvolunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms. Well I have to tell you that how\nthey lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid Nazi trucks. They would raise,\nthey would kill the drivers and take \u2014",
        "A: They were not in the ghetto. They were in this woods, in the bunker. And they would go out\non raids where they would raid Nazi munitions, trucks, outposts. Take whatever, food, clothing,\neverything. Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this\nwoods and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep\ntrying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn\u2019t. So the Nazis thought that these Jews\nwho were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters. But they were\nnot. Now the Banderovski didn\u2019t like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews\nwere doctors. Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way. We\u2019ll stay out of your\nway kind of thing. We\u2019ll leave you alone. And that\u2019s what happened.\nWell my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son,\nthe Nazis were going to burn the ghetto so he got the two volunteers. They all dressed in Nazi\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nuniforms, had commandeered a Nazi jeep and drove to the outskirts of the ghetto at night. The\ntwo men stayed. My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the ghetto, got my mother, my father,\nmy baby sister and me out. Put us in this jeep and brought us to the home of Mr. Borecki.\nBecause my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother\nand the two girls\u2019 lives and he said of course. And so we came in the middle of the night and we\nwere at Mr. Borecki\u2019s house and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father. I\nwill not. I\u2019ve already lost my mother. I\u2019m not going to lose you. So they had no choice but all of\nus now went to the bunker.",
        "A: 1943.",
        "A: I-",
        "A: It probably was still winter. Because there was snow and the bunker was still relatively safe\nbecause the Nazis could, dogs could not get the scent and stuff. So it was winter, probably.",
        "A: Yes, mm hm. Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm. Then apparently and this I hear from\nmy grandfather, my baby sister. Oh there were 37 people in that tunnel. My mother and my\nfather and us. My grandfather\u2019s son, my uncle, his wife. And I think their two boys. They had\ntwo boys. My sister and I were the youngest, by far. And I guess we cried and got lice and\npeople were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody. And my grandfather felt\nthat he just could not do that. That his family could not endanger everybody else because\neveryone wanted to live and they had the right to live.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nSo he decided to take us. He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket. He dressed himself as a\nPolish peasant and took my baby sister and me out. I guess according to my grandfather, I had\nblond hair and dark eyes. My sister had light hair and gray eyes. And he took us both and he\nwent to the local market, looking for someone named Dr. Gruen. Dr. Gruen was a Pole. I think\nhe was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an orphanage for Catholic children. And he\nlooked for, but he couldn\u2019t find him. And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary. He\nwas so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn\u2019t find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was\nready, he was ready to leave us in the market, thinking somebody would find us and keep us.\nAnd keep us alive during the war.\nBut just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor. A Polish\nCatholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals. And\nmy grandfather had helped her with her horse and carriage business. So she saw him and\nrecognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard. And of course she\nsaid she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and\nhe couldn\u2019t find Dr. Gruen. And at that point, he said could you take them. And my grandmother\nhad had to sell her house because the people she had working for her were Jews. And they were\nall in the ghetto and so she couldn\u2019t make a living. So she started working as a cook for a retired\nengineer and his wife, the Szwarczynskis, somewhere in the country. It must have been near\nLvov. And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were\nher sister\u2019s children. Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the\nUkraine and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to Ukraine and left their\nbabies with her. And then she asked Mrs. Szwarczynski could she, could grandma take both.\nAnd Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me. But she couldn\u2019t take a six month old baby.\nSo my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this orphanage. And\napparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the orphanage was and so\nforth. So grandpa had \u2014 now remember all this time he\u2019s passing as a Polish peasant. Very big\none. But the Polish peasant and because my grandfather was six, two and well over 200 pounds.\nHe was -- just an aside. The first time I read Les Miserables, I kept thinking of my grandfather.\nBecause remember Jean Valjean lifts a cart and that\u2019s how Javert knows that he is Jean\nValjean. Well my grandfather could lift a car. So I huss? Anyway, sidebar finished.\nNow back to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: My sister\u2019s name was changed from Tola to Antonina Noviska, which was the name of the\nwoman who saved our lives. Lucia Noviska and that\u2019s when she was left there. And I stayed\nwith the Szwarczynskis and my grandmother. I have a picture, the first picture I have of me was\nat around that time. I was probably around two and a half at this point maybe even three. And I\nhad been following my grandmother who was going into the countryside to forage for whatever\nshe could find in the way of food. And \u2014",
        "A: I, again I remember \u2014",
        "A: Flashes, that\u2019s right. I remember that I wanted her to play with me. I remember that we\npicked dandelions together. And she made me a wreath out of dandelions. And I remember\nputting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep. And this I was told\nlater. That grandma had gone home, thinking that I had probably gone home. And when she\ndidn\u2019t find me there, she was standing outside waiting for me. And ready to go look for me with\nMrs. Szwarczynski. And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body.\nAnd so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told\nher to stay calm. And the soldier came and at that point I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know but I woke up. And\nso grandma was just unbelievably relieved. And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he\nfound me there. And I reminded him of his children back home and so he was bringing me to\nthe closest house because he was sure that\u2019s where I lived.\nSo some kind of way later he had the picture developed and grandma got it and she took that\npicture, saved it and after the war. And by the way that picture is in the Holocaust Museum. As is\na picture of my birth mother, father, uncle and two friends.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nWell anyway then we were still there with the Szwarczynskis. The Szwarczynskis had a dog.\nGreat big huge German shepherd, really fierce watchdog. So fierce that he was not in the house.\nHe was kept on a chain outdoors and fed with a long stick. And one day, again this I was told.\nOne day the dog was outside and I went over to the dog and my grandmother was about to\nscream again. And Mrs. Szwarczynski kept her from yelling and I went over to the dog and\npetted the dog and he started licking me and we became great buddies. Now what I do remember\nis that when the Nazis came I was told to take the dog and go under the table with the dog. Now\none possibility is that, that just as they said to make sure that the dog didn\u2019t remove the Nazi\u2019s\nleg because he had bitten a Nazi before. The other possibility, although it\u2019s fairly remote is that\nthey suspected I was a Jewish child. But I think that\u2019s fairly remote because they were a bit anti-\nSemitic also. And my, there was a woman on the street near where the Szwarczynskis lived who\nhad told the Nazis that Lucia Noviska was hiding a Jewish child. So the Nazis came and took\nher and she was imprisoned. And tortured. And my grandfather of course found out about that\nand he went to Mrs. Szwarczynski and said look, you have to do something. We have to get my\nwife out. And Mrs. Szwarczynski was a good friend of the wife of the commandant and so Mrs.\nSzwarczynski went to the commandant and said you know look, to the wife and said to her, look\nyou know the Nazis have taken my cook and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do because we\nneed her. And she certainly 1s not hiding any Jewish children. And the commandant\u2019s wife talked\nto her husband and the next thing is that the commandant came and she was released from prison\nand told not to talk about it to anyone. And she was released and came back.\nNow what I remember I had \u2014 I was in kind of a crib. I remember a crib with a ladder to get to\nthe crib. And I just remember a ladder that I would climb out of the crib and into. One day I\nheard some noise, lots and lots of noise and the dog came. And grabbed me, some kind of way.\nEither I was on the ladder, I don\u2019t know. But the dog grabbed my clothing or grabbed me,\nsomething, and took me to the door of the house. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where this was\nvis a vis the bedroom. I don\u2019t remember any of this. I do remember the dog taking me. And I do\nremember that a bomb fell on where I had been sleeping.\nSo cause there was lots of bombing going on at that time. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: This is I think not, yes, not, not, not spring yet. Probably \u2014 like February. In April of 1944,\nright around my birthday my grandfather talked to my grandmother and said look I have to go\nback and see how everybody is doing in the bunker, in the tunnel. And so I\u2019m going to go back.\nSo he went back to the tunnel.",
        "A: And he saw one other man there who was alive and everybody else had been shot and\nbombed. And he buried everyone.",
        "A: And (pause, sigh) and then in 1944 in June, the Russians came to Lvov. And the one\nadvantage we had with the Russians at that time was because grandpa was a survivor of a killing\ncamp, the Russians gave him preferential treatment which meant that he could get an apartment\nin the bombed out buildings. He could get rags for clothes, that kind of thing. So that\u2019s what\nhappened. And that was right around my birthday I think. And then we went to one DP camp\nwhich 1s displaced persons. But I like to think of it as delayed pilgrims. Yes so very delayed. So\nthen \u2014",

And nothing at that point and then we went to our first I guess our second DP camp.\nAnd what I remember was that grandma took one look and she said no we\u2019re not staying here.\nTurned out that a girl had died of TB in one of the beds and so grandma wasn\u2019t going to stay\nthere no matter what. Then we went to another DP camp and \u2014",

        "A: Yeah were all like that and I remember the streets being torn up and boulders here and there.\nGrandma says that I, she was with me. I have no idea where this was but probably where that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\napartment was where we were living. And that she was with me and she saw, we saw a truck go\nby with blood and bodies and blood oozing and that she fainted and she was holding me and I\nfell to the ground and broke my nose for the first time. So I don\u2019t remember that. I don\u2019t\nremember that at all. I remember her tell, she told me that. Well I do remember lots of broken\nbuildings. I remember people kind of frantic. I remember, I remember a man and a woman and a\nlittle girl and they were going very fast and everybody was frowning and this little girl was\ntrying to keep up. I remember watching that.\nI don\u2019t know where that was but I remember that. Then we moved as I say, to this third DP\ncamp. I have no idea where it was. I have no idea. That\u2019s the one where we were asleep at night\nand suddenly grandma smelled smoke and woke us all up and the barrack we were in was on\nfire. So we got out with our pajamas. And we had a suitcase that was filled with I guess some\nold fur coats and some gold and that \u2014",
        "A: Grandpa and grandma. Yeah we were all together and you know it had meats and fur coats\nand they all burned out. And so we were left with our pajamas period. And then the next thing I\nknow we were in our final DP camp which I do remember. And I was told how we got there.\nIgnacio -- oh let me think of his last name. It\u20191l1 come to me in a moment. But anyway he had\nbeen a friend of grandpa\u2019s and he ran this particular DP camp in Linz Austria. And it was called\nCamp Taylor in Wegscheid.

And we gota\ngalvanized tub and when we could find wood or something to make fires we could have hot\ndrinks and a bath once a week. And the bath was with lye soap and kerosene. Because of the lice\nto try to prevent lice. And the bathrooms were like wooden privies all in a row together at one\nside. And in this camp there was a schul where we went every week for Friday night services\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nand all day Saturday.

And grandma holding on to me for\nall she was worth. And me feeling hey grandma let go. But so yeah. I remember grandpa being\nthere. And we ran black market sugar and when grandpa left I had to do it because grandma\ncouldn\u2019t read or write in any language or really figure. So \u2014",
        "A: I went to a school, Hebrew school yes.",
        "A: Mmhm. Mmhm. Where I got smacked because I was left handed. That was a sign of the\ndevil. So I kept getting my hand smacked. But according to grandpa I was so smart and you\nknow more. But that of course is my grandpa. So anyway I do remember I had a little dog.\nGrandma sided with me and we got a dog. Oh first.\nGrandpa wanted to marry grandma. Cause she did love him very much. And she had saved our\nlives and he had asked her if he could give her money and she said no. My life is with you and\nwith Jula and all. So in order to convert the rabbi said ok but she would have to shave her head\nand go into the mikvah. And I remember grandma saying, Isaac, I have so little hair, and I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nremember sometimes when grandpa made up his mind you didn\u2019t mess with grandpa. And he\nwent to the rabbi and he said look, Lucia wants to become a Jew. She does us great, great proud\nby wanting to become a Jew. She doesn\u2019t want to shave her head. She will not shave her head.\nAnd the rabbi, ok, Isaac she won\u2019t shave her head, all right, all right. So grandpa became Jewish.\nI mean grandma. Became Jewish and became Leah I guess, although nobody ever called her\nLeah. Later she dubbed herself Lucy cause she watched I Love Lucy. But it was Lucia Noviska\nEisen. So can we stop for a little bit.",
        "A: We would hide the sugar. It would serve as pillows in this huge bed that grandpa, grandma\nand I all slept in.",
        "A: Yes, great big bags of sugar and whenever the police came to look around and so forth, I was,\nit was my duty to be in bed.",
        "A: I'd sleep on the sugar, right. So that\u2019s -- I remember that. I remember my grandfather\nworked in a matzah making kind of oven there in lager. We called DP camp lager. And I\nremember we had Purim plays and this and that. And I remember where I\u2019d take the little dog to\nschul. I'd try to stay out of the way of the men who would, if they could get close enough would\nsmack you. So you had to kind of make sure you were running fast enough and avoid the\nsmacks, with my little team of cohorts.\nAnd then we\u2019d go outside schul and make mud pies and things like that. And in the winter\ngrandma would wrap me in rags and everything and there was a huge hill that was like a hole\nand not a hill, 1t was a hole. A huge hole that was dug there and we kids would go sledding there.\nAnd to me I\u2019d walk around that, the parameters of this hole and that was where God was. And so\nI remember always asking for my baby sister. I wanted my baby sister. And God to me, at that\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\npoint, was like a puppeteer and there were wars and things went wrong because people were like\nmarionettes and the strings would get tangled, so that\u2019s what I remember.\nI remember walking with my grandfather once and taking his hand and asking him grandpa,\nwhere are my parents? And he said oh they\u2019re they went on a trip, they\u2019re far away. I said Jaju\nthey\u2019re never coming back, are they. And he looked at me and I saw these huge tears, fat\nteardrops coming from his eyes. And he was not a man who cried easily. And I knew that was\nnot a question to ask any more and I knew they were dead.\nAnd I remember once not far from the bunk we were in, there was a huge tree and there were\ntwin brothers. They were either late teens or early 20s. They seemed aged, very aged to me at the\ntime, but that\u2019s how old they probably were, 18 to 21. And they were standing by the tree and\nlightning struck and they died. They were killed and I remember seeing that. And, and that was\npretty scary.\nAnd we got a care package in lager and it was said that I was going to be leaving so everybody in\nlager decided that this new plastic raincoat should go to me. Now mind you I was all of seven\nand this was an adult raincoat but nonetheless Jula had to have it. So I was so proud, this blue\nplastic raincoat. And then what I heard later was that grandpa had tried to get us into Palestine,\nthe three of us and then eventually he tried to get us into Israel because remember 1n 48 Israel\nwas not accepting and Palestine didn\u2019t want any old, old people and orphan children. So we\nwere living a pretty difficult existence so grandpa thought it would be best if he sent me to the\nStates. And my Tante Siegel sponsored me and what I remember is passing a place with a huge\nmetal fence, very high metal fence. And I remember children at one side of it, the other side\nclinging to that fence and looking at us.\nAnd I said Jaju promise me you\u2019|l never put me there, promise. And he promised. And then I\nwas there and because he had made -- he had decided to send me to America. And I had to go\nthrough a series of orphanages and they were Catholic orphanages or something cause I\nremember nuns and that was one of them. And \u2014",

        "A: Mm hm. And I remember being very, very sad and crying and apparently the nuns were very\nworried that I was going to die because I wasn\u2019t eating. I wasn\u2019t, I was just kind of fading away.\nSo they called my grandfather or contacted him some kind of way. And he and grandma came\nand he brought me a china doll which was the first toy I'd ever had because the only toys I had\nknown were origami soldiers made out of newspapers on horses, also made out of newspapers\nthat grandpa and I would play.\nAnd so I had this doll and not only was she a doll, she had eyes that opened and closed. Yep.\nAnd he also brought a bag of oranges. And that was incredibly much of a huge, huge big deal.\nAnd he found one of the older girls and he asked her if she would take care of me on the way to\nAmerica and she said yes. Grandpa gave the oranges, some to her and some to the nun, nuns.\nAnd (pause) I remember feeling very sad. But this girl was very nice and she would do my hair\nand she would try to, she just was there. I don\u2019t remember her name or anything. I Just remember\nshe was nice. And I remember that was \u2014 the ship we came on. We slept in hammocks. Ok and\nthere were four of them. And I was the youngest so I was on the bottom one.",

        "A: Mm hm. Jula Weinstock Eisen. And then I had a terrible toothache because I grew up on\nAmerican Coca Cola which was the big thing and if it was American it had to be wonderful. So\nI, that\u2019s what I lived on. Well I had terribly rotten teeth. I had a horrible toothache. And I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nremember the nun giving me oil of cloves or putting oil of cloves on me so I smelled like oil of\ncloves. Then we were on the ship.",
        "A: The General Bumbe. I always thought that it was in December that I came to the States but\nwhen I read in the manifest it said November 14\". I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when it sailed or that\u2019s\nwhen we landed. And I don\u2019t know where we landed.",
        "A: Unh hunh. I do remember, I thought it was Baltimore. That\u2019s what I remember, Baltimore.\nAnd what I do remember, and some of these I\u2019ve written about was ladies coming with little\nAmerican flags to give us American flags. Later I found out they were the DAR. And I\nremember one lady coming up to me and talking to me and giving me my flag and I had no idea\nwhat she was saying because the English I knew was taught to me by an American soldier. And I\ncould count, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That was the extent of my\nEnglish.\nSo what I didn\u2019t understand the woman spoke louder. And she screamed in my ear and I\nremember thinking, why do all Americans yell. And I couldn\u2019t believe it. But then I remember\nthe nuns getting us on a bus and I said to the nun. I was very thirsty. And she gave me an orange\nand that didn\u2019t slack my thirst at all. But then I remember sleeping and it seemed like forever\nand then arriving at a soot covered brick building in New York. And what I loved about that\nbuilding was it had a marble staircase. And like Tevya, I loved running up and down those stairs\nbecause I loved the sound that marble made. And they also had sweetheart soap. Well that was\nthe first time I had smelled soap that smelled, didn\u2019t smell like tar and it was -- I kept washing\nmy hands. And that was glorious. And I remember coming down the stairs one day and I\nremember this woman at the bottom talking to the nun. And what I heard and it was in German\nwas she can\u2019t be Isaac\u2019s granddaughter. Isaac is so handsome. And then look at that hair. I bet\nshe has lice. And that was my introduction to my Aunt Helen.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nGail Schwartz: This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Julie Keefer. This is track number two and you were talking\nabout coming to the United States and then coming, your aunt was downstairs discussing you.\nJulie Keefer: But first I\u2019m going to just back track a little bit. The nuns I remember, one of the\nnuns taking me to a park somewhere in New York. And in the park, I saw a little girl, probably\naround my age. I was seven. And I looked at her and I figured out how it was that Americans\ncould make those strange sounds. Like three and through because they had special throats. And\nthose throats came out and because I had never seen bubble gum before. And this girl was\nblowing a bubble.",
        "A: Yes, to make those funny sounds, mm hm. So I remember that. And now I\u2019m back with Aunt\nSiegel. No, Aunt Helen. Aunt Helen Fichtenbaum was my grandfather\u2019s youngest sibling.\nAnd she shared a house with her older sister Rosa who was widowed. And Rosa had a daughter\nElaine Yeta, who was 16. And Aunt Helen had a daughter Perry, who was 12. And a husband,\nDick. And they lived in half of a duplex in a very Orthodox section of Brooklyn. And the first\nday that I remember was Aunt Helen taking me to their bathroom and cutting my hair, because\nshe was very sure that I had lice, so she cut my hair which made me cry because I was so proud\nof not having lice. It was a big thing. And then I was a student at the local elementary school\nwhere the only teacher in the school who spoke any language I did was the kindergarten teacher\nwho spoke German.",
        "A: Oh I knew a little bit of Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, German. And Ukrainian.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: A little bit, very little. And so I went to the local school and the children called me retard\nbecause I was tall for my age and here I was in kindergarten at age seven. And seven and a half.\nAnd they also called me Nazi because the language I spoke was German. And Aunt Helen was a\nvery troubled woman and it was very hard for her to take this child who had come from a war\ntorn country and who was a granddaughter of this absent older brother that she idealized. And I\nwas not a pretty child at all. And so she didn\u2019t know quite what to do with me. She was a little\noverwhelmed. Her daughter Perry was allergic to everything and Perry and I shared a room.\nAnd I just remember being truly, truly unhappy and waiting. I couldn\u2019t wait for the weekends\nwhen I would go see Tante Siegel. Tante Siegel was my father\u2019s aunt. And she is the one who\nsponsored my coming to America. She lived in the Bronx in, on the third floor of a walk up. In\na one bedroom apartment. This one bedroom apartment, as you walked in the door you looked\ndirectly at some French doors covered by lace curtains that were the entrance to the bedroom.\nAnd otherwise you saw a sofa, a couple of chairs and a black telephone and a glass bottle near\nthe telephone where everyone who wanted to make a call had to put in a nickel.\nThen there were tzedakah boxes all over the place and they were blue with white Jewish stars on\nthem. They were all for some cause or other in Israel. For yeshivas, for trees, for whatever.\nAnd Tante Siegel herself was about four foot ten with huge round blue eyes. High cheekbones, a\nClara Bow mouth and a very, very pretty face. Blondish gray hair. Her brother, Uncle Charlie,\nalso was short but a little taller than she. And I met him a little afterwards and he had a farm in\nthe Adirondacks that he had apparently sold the farm. He had had five daughters. He and his\nwife Sophie had five daughters. Like Tevya. And no sons. So he sold the farm but kept the\nbungalow which was a house. And there was a man-made lake and I remember Uncle Charlie\ndriving me in this beat up black car over these hairpin turns at what seemed like umpteen miles\nan hour. Well of course it wasn\u2019t. But I remember Uncle Charlie\u2019s huge hands. He had these\nhand with large knuckles and when I first saw Van Gogh\u2019s the Potato Eaters, I could always\nremember Uncle Charlie cause that\u2019s what he looked like, his hands looked like.\nWell back to Aunt Helen -- Tante Siegel and her apartment. There was a window. On the door\nwas \u2014 the window was on the left and I remember I would sit at that window for hours and hours\nand hours and just look out and just look out. There, it was all concrete. There was some kind of\na basketball court. You know concrete playground with a high fence, metal fence around it and I\nwould watch people play. And I remember feeling very sad. But Tante Siegel was very, very\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nwarm. And her husband Uncle Jake, was a little taller than she. Huge, beak like nose, but Uncle\nJake almost never spoke. He was like a shadow. So we never knew what he was thinking or\nwhatever. He just was there. He might as well have been invisible. But I loved those times at\nTante Siegel\u2019s.\nTante Siegel had two children. She had Marvin who was in the army, very good looking and I\nonly saw his pictures. And she had Adele who was married to Sid Roman. And they were\nsupposed to move to an apartment on the other side of the third floor but it wasn\u2019t ready. So they\nwere staying with Tante Siegel. Had to pull out something. So to say there was no room in this\napartment. So the Joint wouldn\u2019t let me live there. And, but I loved going there. And I heard\nfrom my cousin Sid, many years later he had given me a huge teddy bear which he had won at a\nfair and he was going to give it to their first child. But he said, you looked so sad and needy there\nthat I thought maybe I better give it to you. So he gave it to me. And I, very imaginative child,\nnamed this teddy bear, Louka, which means doll in Polish. But oh I loved that teddy bear. And\nthat was a happy time. And Tante Siegel would have a yummy brunch every Sunday with white\nfish and sable, and lox and bagels and cheeses and tomatoes and all kinds of yummy stuff,\nalways milchig. And I would be doing dishes and I inevitably used the wrong dish towel. And\nwe had to go find a place that had any dirt in Bronx New York. But that was a challenge. So that\nwas Tante Siegel.\nI remember once Aunt Rosa who always looked unbelievably chic. She had a black chignon.\nI\u2019m sure she died her hair but she was very regal looking, in contrast to her sister Aunt Helen\nwho always looked bedraggled and harried. In shapeless housedresses which were ugly. Never\nsmiled. Anyway Aunt, Tante Rosa worked outside the home. And one day she took me out for\nlunch and to buy me a new skirt. And the skirt, I remember was gray but it was kind of full, had\nbig pockets with blue trim on the pocket, the top part of the pocket. And I thought it was\ngorgeous. And I wore it back to Aunt Helen\u2019s and I remember her yelling in the kitchen where\nAunt Helen was yelling and saying why did you take that brat? Why didn\u2019t you take Perry? She\ndeserves it. That brat doesn\u2019t deserve anything. I don\u2019t know what Isaac and that woman were\nthinking of. And I decided that I wouldn\u2019t wear the skirt by Aunt Helen because all it did was get\nTante Rosa in trouble. So I would only wear it at Tante Siegel\u2019s.\nWell, one day I remembered, I was still a bit of a ring leader and Perry was very, very shy and I\nremember saying to Perry, let\u2019s go visit Yeta\u2019s room, Elaine, at that time she was called Elaine\u2019s\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nroom. So her room was in the very front of the house and it had one of those satiny bedspreads\nthat I -- quilted satin, and all these cologne bottles on a blond mirrored dresser which I thought\nwas so gorgeous. And they all smelled so good. So I remember that was just a whole new world.\nYeta was a -- Elaine wasn\u2019t thrilled that these two younger went to her room but I think she\nforgave us eventually but I remember that was so pretty.\nI just remember Aunt Helen saying that well if you\u2019re good I'll show you a picture of your\ngrandpa when, in his soldier uniform which I had never seen him so I was -- I tried to be so\ngood. And I was never quite good enough. So I never did see that picture. And I guess I must\nhave been there for eight or nine months. And it was a very, very difficult time. Probably for\neveryone. But I remember it being very difficult for me.\nAnd I remember the social worker from the Joint coming. The first time and I was warned that I\nwas to tell her that I was being treated beautifully and that I was very happy. And the second\ntime she came, I didn\u2019t care and I told her I hate it here. And that I was fed with -- like a dog.\nFood was left in front of the bedroom. That I was a pretty awful person and ugh. Um. The\nsocial worker said Julie, we\u2019re going to send you to the country. You\u2019re going to go where you'll\nsee chickens and cows and other children. And I thought wow, that\u2019s pretty great. I didn\u2019t want\nto leave Tante Siegel cause I adored her. So that was pretty sad, leaving her. But I -- someone\nput me in a pretty new pink dress. And I remember it had belts that tied in the back, with some\nflowers on it. I was eight years old and I was put on an airplane. And told that someone in\nBellefaire would meet me at the other end. In Cleveland. And so I was being sent to Bellefaire\nJewish children\u2019s home for problem children. And it was in Shaker Heights, Ohio. (laughs) No\nchickens, no cows, children yes. (laughs)\nBut there were cottages which were brick buildings and we were assigned in cottages by gender.\nAnd by age. And I was put in the little kids\u2019 cottage when I first came which was run by Aviva\nand Chaim Orlen who were an Israeli couple and they were, they were very nice. I remember \u2014\nwhat I remember is at night getting this horrible medicine, codfish liver oil and other stuff. That\nwas sweet. And then we\u2019d get one of those Mallomar cookies with milk. Well that was so\ndelicious. I also remember a little girl there named Tanya. Although she was older than I, she\nwas almost a head shorter.\nAnd I remember that my teddy bear had no eyes. The eyes had been removed. I don\u2019t know\nwhat ever happened to the china doll. I don\u2019t remember but I remember that my teddy bear who I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nloved had lost his eyes. And I suspected that it was Tanya. I remember this so clearly. I said\nTanya if you tell me the truth, I won\u2019t hit you. So she told me the truth. Yeah, she did it. And I\nthought that, was that stupid of me or not. Why did I say I wouldn\u2019t hit her. I was mad. But at\nleast she told the truth. (sigh)",

        "A: It was Bellefaire. It was run by Fritz Mayer who was a cohort of Bruno Bettelheim\u2019s whereas\nBruno Bettelheim believed in psychoanalysis, Fritz Mayer believed in milieu therapy. So the\nBellefaire was run on milieu therapy kind of thing where we had all kinds of activities. We had\nwoodshop, we had art. We had Miss Sugar and story hour and lots of books in the library and I\nloved reading and apparently that was my escape.\nAnd I was afraid of loud noises, uniforms and playing hide and seek.",
        "A: I had a series of social workers until one day I said I\u2019m not going to talk to you anymore\nbecause you\u2019re just going to leave like all the others and Bellefaire decided to put me on a trial\nwith University Hospital, Hannah House and they sent me to a child analyst, Marian Barnes. And\nI saw Ms. Barnes for many years. She was really special. And I remember sitting on this great\nhorsehair sofa in the waiting room of Hannah house, picturing what Ms. Barnes would look like.\nAnd she would be beautiful with dark hair and -- well I went into the office where she was and\nshe was middle aged, gray hair, kind of round. Old. And she said, Julie or Julia. I was called\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nJulia at this point, I can\u2019t be your mother, but I can be like a favorite aunt. And in fact she was.\nWhen I was in talent shows, Ms. Barnes was always there. She gave me my tiny tears doll who\nwet and had \u2014 cried real tears. And my first bicycle. And when I was singing Frankie and\nJohnny at the talent show and looking straight up at the ceiling cause I was so nervous, she was\nsitting there in the audience clapping. Ms. Barnes was I think what kept me going for a long\ntime. And did I talk about the war? Yes. I talked about my dreams. I talked about \u2014 yeah, I\ntalked about a lot of things with Ms. Barnes.\nMeanwhile we had various social \u2014 various cottage parents. We had cottage parents during the\nday, cottage parents at night and like permanent couple who lived with us. And I remember I\nwas put in the big girls\u2019 cottage. I think I was ten. When my grandparents came I was close to\n11. And I have some pictures there. And I remember I didn\u2019t remember my Polish. Just English.\nGrandpa\u2019s shoes squeaked when he walked. And I remember grandpa and grandma and I going\nto the Fairmont theater, walking. And I remember being a little bit distant from my grandfather,\ngrandmother. And Ms. Barnes informed me that I had acted like a brat. (laughs) and I said yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah I remembered them. But part of what was going on -- Bupsha I told you had been\ntortured and sometimes she was not totally rational. And she said that I was so horrible that even\nmy grandfather didn\u2019t\u2019 want me around. That\u2019s why he sent me away. And I believed that. And\num (pause) um, I was also upset with my grandfather and also feeling terribly guilty because my\ntime with his sister was awful. So I felt ambivalent about that visit. Very. It was also at \u2014 you\nwant me to stop.",

        "A: With phenomenal parents.",
        "A: Fred and Tea Klejstadt. And they were unbelievable people. And I was so, so lucky.\nUnbelievably lucky. I met them first, Fritz Mayer didn\u2019t believe in our being institutionalized so\nwe had big sisters, big brothers to take us out. And I met the Klejstadts with three other girls.\nThey took us out for a picnic and I remember thinking how beautiful Tea was and sweet and how\nspecial I felt around her. Fred I thought was nice but I, she was warmth itself. And I had a very\ndear friend in Bellefaire whose name was Joyce. And we were assigned permanent big sisters,\nbig brothers. And I was assigned to Nussensens who were lovely warm large Jewish family\nwith two sons. The younger son had some mental health issues and I adored them both. They\nwere like little brothers and they were just special. And Flo and Manny Nussensen were warm as\nwarm could be. And I was just included in everything which was neat cause I was kind of a shy,\ndream, dreamy child who, who read all the time. And I drew a lot and painted. At Bellefaire I\nhad an art teacher who had no thumbs and he was a phenomenal man. And I learned a great deal\nfrom him. He\u2019s black and one of my favorite counselors was black. And I mention that because\nwe were going to Parma tubing which 1s a special lake with all kinds of stuff in Cleveland. We\nwere on a big bus with this counselor and Fritz Mayer and we got to Parma tubing and someone\ncame up and said oh no, we don\u2019t allow Negroes here. And so I remember Fritz Mayer puffing\nhimself out. Zis will not go on. Come, children, get in the bus. So if you don\u2019t\u2019 take one of us,\nyou take none of us. So we all left.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nBut this counselor was wonderful because one, we used to give plays for July fourth. And she\nhad Paul Robeson, Ballad for the Americans. And so I went to her house to hear it. And I was\nusually the star or whatever so she wanted me to listen to it. And I remember that was special.\nAnd then we had a cottage parents who were Mormon and he was getting his degree, advanced\ndegree in chemistry. So he used to make our shampoos. They were smelly, ugh. But I suppose\nthey were good. And his wife was just a sweetie pie. They used to play folk music and a lot of\nLeadbelly. So I grew up on Leadbelly.",
        "A: Never stayed with them. I just went on that picnic with them and I was back to Bellefaire and\nI was in elementary school and at Andrew Jackson Rikoff where the teachers stayed in their\nrooms and students went to different teachers for different subjects. And I had a math teacher.\nThis was sixth grade. Oh, fourth grade was my first experience at Andrew Jackson Rikoff. Well\nfirst I went to a very elegant school, elementary school, third grade near Bellefaire. And the\nteacher thought I was retarded because I wrote things backwards. And she wanted us to have\nfresh handkerchiefs pinned on us. And at Bellefaire we had these sewing ladies who would redo\nclothes so they would fit us and stuff. So I went up and I asked for a hankie and they gave me a\nbox of Kleenex. They said this is much more sanitary. So I came in with my box of Kleenex and\nteacher was sure I was definitely retarded so Bellefaire decided to test me. So I remember having\na battery of tests. They decided no, I wasn\u2019t retarded. And but they also decided I was artistic.\nThat Julie needed piano lessons. Well we had one piano and it was in the playroom and I was in\nthe big girls\u2019 cottage now. Well Julie, Julie had to practice. Julia. No one was allowed in the\nplayroom when Julia had to practice. Makes you instantly popular doesn\u2019t it?\nI decided I don\u2019t\u2019 want piano lessons so my piano teacher and I started talking about African\nviolets and she taught me to knit instead which was great. But I remained very interested in art.\nAnd anyway, I\u2019m \u2014",

        "A: Well I had met my parents when I was on that outing when I was 11. And they decided then\nthey wanted to adopt me. And I had a hard time with that. Didn\u2019t want to be adopted. Took me a\nlong time to figure out who I was and didn\u2019t want to change it.\nUm, so I saw Ms. Barnes again to decide whether I would be adopted or not. And she helped.\nAnd my grandfather was very against it. At this time they were in the States and I was to go see\nthem every summer. I couldn\u2019t live with them because they lived in some pretty awful slums\nand the Joint didn\u2019t think that that was safe. Then when I went to my parents, it was my mother\nwas an artist. And I guess, I loved art and it was like wow, and my father loved having a\ndaughter. And it was amazing to me because he was very, very educated, well-educated man\nwho did not take to fools lightly. He had a PhD. And yet I could you know if I were taking\nFrench, we\u2019d speak French at the table so that Julie could practice. So he was very special. And\nthey both were. And we became very, very close.\nAnd my grandfather eventually met my parents. Although he didn\u2019t understand adoption. He\nthought it was a form of white slavery. So I had him come and meet them. And he fell in love\nwith my mother. He thought she was like his daughter and my father was a good business man\nand that he was very thrilled about. So I was adopted. I skipped a year of high school because\nfrankly I didn\u2019t want to take math. I was terrible in math and at that time, they gave you tests in\nEnglish and history and if you did well, you were put in top track. And top track meant that you\nhad to have physics and you had to have advanced, advanced math. So I wanted to skip a year\nand skip that. So I did.\nAnd I graduated and my father, I said I\u2019m not going to college. And my father said um, well it\u2019s\nnot a question of going or not going. It\u2019s a question of which college. So I said well I want to go\nto Sarah Lawrence and my mother said well because I had met a girl who looked like a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nRembrandt painting and with her red hair and everything and she went to Sarah Lawrence so I\nwanted to go there.\nMy mother said honey, you know you might want to go someplace that\u2019s coed where you\u2019d be\nwith both boys and girls. So I also wanted to go to the University of Chicago. So my father took\nme down and did not like Hyde Park at all, at all, at all and said mm, mm. You\u2019re too young to\nbe in this. Meanwhile I had got early admittance to Antioch and I went to see Antioch. I just\nturned 16. But I couldn\u2019t handle that much freedom. So I said I can\u2019t handle that much freedom.\nMy father said well I have this idea. There\u2019s a school that\u2019s close to us and I would like you to\ncheck it out for your cousin Suzanne because not only 1s it a good liberal arts school but it has a\ngood conservatory for your cousin. So I\u2019d like a young person\u2019s opinion. I said ok, Pll go with\nyou. Went with him. Next thing I know, I\u2019ve got an appointment with Dean Jackson, dean of\nadmissions and Dean Jackson said you know introduces himself. And my father is sitting there\nand I said actually Dean Jackson you don\u2019t want to take me because I did ok on the English part\nbut on the math part. He said yeah I see. Did you just write your name and then turn it in. I said\n\u2014 he said yeah, hm. He said well you know you didn\u2019t have your three years of high school math\nto get in so you\u2019d have to have your third year of math to get out. But yeah they decided they\nwould take me.\nSo my father \u2014 I said take me. We\u2019re looking at this for my cousin and Julie you know we just\nadopted you and you\u2019ve been with us so little and Oberlin is only an hour away and we\u2019d like to\nbe close to you. And I said ok. And I went to classes and I felt so comfortable because I had gone\nto Miami, University of Miami, Miami University in Ohio and I hated it. People were nice\nenough but I was doing a crossword puzzle and suddenly I was an egghead. And unh, unh, I\u2019d\nhad enough of that. At high school. I just wanted a chance just to be me.\nAnd at Oberlin I could be me. And I loved that and I just, so that\u2019s why I went to Oberlin and\nkept changing majors. And then junior year when you had to declare your major, I had most\nhours in French and art. And studio art was a very long major and so I decided I would go for\nFrench. And I had met Larry when he was a senior and I was a junior living at French house.\nAnd he went to the University of New Hampshire for graduate school in chemistry. And he\nasked me to marry him which is also a funny story.\nI called my father to tell him that I was engaged. This is my senior year. I was, Daddy, \u2019'm\nengaged. You\u2019re what? I\u2019m engaged Daddy. Quiet, the silence. He didn\u2019t ask me. Daddy he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\ndoesn\u2019t want to marry you. That fell really like a bomb. And then Larry wasn\u2019t Jewish. And my\nparents were upset about this. Everybody was upset about it. And but Larry was an amazing,\namazing, iS an amazing man.",
        "A: And then we lived in Durham, New Hampshire while Larry finished his degree and I taught\nFrench and Spanish at the local high school. Then for two years. Then I had Steve and you could\nnot teach if you were pregnant at that time. And the, then when Steve was close to a year, we left\nand went to Chicago, Larry\u2019s first job. We stayed in Chicago for three and a half years and then,\nwell three years. Then moved to Omaha, Nebraska and that\u2019s where our daughter was born and\nshe had a naming ceremony and Larry decided that he also wanted to convert at that. He had\ntaken the course in Chicago from Rabbi Devine who had them read God, Jews and History by\nMax Dimont. And Larry thought, great this is my thing. So he decided to convert and when he\nwas asked ok so you'll be Abraham. He said no, I don\u2019t want to be Abraham, I want to Moshe.\nSo they said ok be Moshe, so that\u2019s why you see the various Moses\u2019s over there. And so that\u2019s,\nwe lived in Nebraska where Larry worked at the University of -- at a research place for cancer\nresearch. That was a part of the University of Nebraska Medical School.\nThen we came down here where -- oh and I got a few more degrees in Omaha. I had substitute\ntaught in Chicago where if you could breathe and walk, they told you, you could teach. And then\nI realized that I needed much more training to deal with kids with problems which I enjoyed.\nAnd so when we got here I was going to go on in that field, and that\u2019s what I did.",
        "A: (pause) I think in a way it certainly influenced our son. Because I had made a big, big thing\nof having him have a bar mitzvah. Grandpa wanted to live to see his great grandson bar\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nmitzvahed. Great, great, I guess hunh. And so I put some pressure on Steve to have the bar\nmitzvah and he had a hard time with that one. And I had grandpa\u2019s diary translated. And I think\nit was a lot for him to deal with being the son of a survivor cause it kind of fell on him. And I\nthink the family hero was grandpa who started a resistance and all of that. Steve eventually\njoined the rangers, the airborne rangers and I think that\u2019s partially why.\nSo I think yes, to some extent, but mm. I was worried about the kind of parent I would be\nbecause my grandma was at times very difficult and I didn\u2019t want to be like that. But I had lots\nand lots of help as I was growing up and I had lots of people who were very important to me. I\nwas very blessed in that.\nSo (sigh) I think I got demonstrations of how to love very well.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not at all, not at all. I think what I do deal with is big time is survivor guilt. And that you\nknow is the baggage that you try to move around and move around and get rid of. You don\u2019t get\nrid of it but you can move it around. But no, no. not at all. If your question is did I derive, you\nsaid people having a so called easier life than I did. No. Because I feel that pain is also very\npersonal. How do you compare people\u2019s pain? And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to com \u2014 you know to\nsay this person\u2019s pain is greater than this.\nOne thing I did have great difficulty with. When I went to, I told you I went to Israel last with\nRabbis for human rights. It was an outstanding trip but it was terribly painful because I had gone\nto Yad Vashem first. I went early and Yad Vashem 1s now very different than it was when I first\nwent there. It\u2019s a huge spread of acres which is interesting because as you walk through it, you\nhave this feeling of freedom and then you come up against one of the railroad cars where you can\nwalk into various \u2014 but this feeling of freedom.\nAnd you know there\u2019s an awful lot of lip service paid to the Holocaust. Never again will we have\nthis. Never again but I have great difficulty because never again but to us. Not necessarily to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nanyone else. And that just really, that hurt my heart. To see what we\u2019re all doing in Israel itself.\nAnd I\u2019m not saying that you know it\u2019s all one sided or whatever, whatever. But oh. Anyway. So\nI had great difficulty with that.",
        "A: No, no. I\u2019m comfortable around survivors and non survivors.",
        "A: When we were first living in Chicago, Larry and I, we lived near Michael Reese hospital and\nthere were always sirens, sirens and sirens used to terrify me. And so Larry said to me one day,\nwell but Julie think of it this way. These are all pregnant women going to have babies. Well it\nworked. (laughs) And I would smilingly think of all these pregnant ladies going to have babies.\nYeah, it was wonderful, yep.",
        "A: Yeah. When we were in California we went to Hirsh Park to hear a concert, live concert.\nThat\u2019s where the Nazis, neo-Nazis had their headquarters. And I saw them in their uniforms\nmarching around and I was beside myself I was so livid. And I was with my brother in law and\nmy husband and my three year old son. And I broke free from them and I went up to the Nazis\nand I said you are such worthless, worthless people. Well we have the right to believe what \u2014 I\nsaid yes, and you\u2019re doing it in a park that was contributed by Jews. I said hunh and I said I just,\nI think you are such the crap of the earth. And I said and that\u2019s my freedom of speech.",
        "A: No, no, no. but Larry was \u2014 and Jim were ready to save me and so forth. And so on. And \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: I, you know, the first ttme I went to Ger \u2014 no it was actually the second time I went to\nGermany, I had great difficulty. I had come from France and I was to meet Larry in Germany.\nWe were going to go to Freiburg because he had a doctor herr Drochi, who had invented a\nspecial kind of rat for cancer research. And so I was to meet Larry there so we could have a\nvacation also. I had come from France. And I had a glorious time and I was sitting there 1n this\ncar with these French young men who were going to Germany to work. Cause Germany paid\nmuch better wages. And just as we passed the border, the German police came on very, very\nofficious and I got my dander up a bit and I had a big suitcase. And I didn\u2019t understand a word\nthey were saying and I could care less. And the soldiers, the French soldiers said you know\ndon\u2019t make a big issue of this. It\u2019s ok. We\u2019re here for you. We understand. They understood\nnothing but they were lovely.\nAnd so they were gentling me along. And they got the suitcase down. They said there\u2019s nothing\nthere. She\u2019s an American, whatever, whatever. But that was my first taste. And then I got to the\nrailroad station. And I was supposed to meet Larry there. He wasn\u2019t there. And I, there am I\nwith this huge suitcase, no Larry. A man comes up to me cause apparently that\u2019s where you pick\nup prostitutes at the train station. And I didn\u2019t know. So (phone ringing) I \u2014 then Larry came and\nI was furious with Larry. And he had gotten the wrong time that the train was to come in and I\nwas so angry with him.\nThen we had an interesting -- we stayed at the, I called it the rat house. We stayed there and for\na night and then herr doctor Drochi invited us to his apartment. So Larry and I went there and I\nsaw this man who was a caricature. A dueling scar. I think he was wearing a monocle even, I\nthink so. And he kissed my hand and like that was his feat. And I looked at Larry and he said oh\nyou know how nice to meet Larry. He spoke German and French, no English. Nice to meet\nLarry and his French wife. And I said Je ne suis pas Francaise. Je suis Americaine et je suis\njuife [ph]. Just like that cause I thought I am going to clear the air with this jerk. And we\u2019re\nsitting down and he\u2019s giving me the party line. We\u2019re talking the problems with America.\nThey\u2019re all due to miscegenation. All in French. And I\u2019m thinking I can\u2019t believe that this guy\nis still around. He\u2019s a Nazi so and so. And Larry said no, no, no, no. he wouldn\u2019t have this\nposition, Julie. He can\u2019t be a Nazi, no way and when we came back and we were having lunch\nwith Umberto Safiati who was the NIH who is a sweetheart. And Umberto said so how was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nlunch with the Nazi? And Larry said what? He said oh yeah, yeah Drochi was a Nazi. Didn\u2019t\nyou know that Larry? And I said hm. But Larry is so naive. He\u2019s so naive. Yeah, so.",
        "A: None.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember a pretty or nice Poland. What I want to see is to find out where things were\nand so forth and so on, but nostalgia no.",
        "A: No, never.",
        "A: Yes, Larry and I will be going back. He\u2019s going to go first cause he has to give a speech in\nKrakow. And then we\u2019ll trace a few things. And we\u2019re going to go, I think maybe to even\nWarsaw, to the Jewish information institute to find out what we can about my sister.",
        "A: Never found no.",
        "A: Sure, I that\u2019s where I yeah which is now of course L\u2019viv and it\u2019s the Ukraine. Yeah, I want to\ngo back. I want to see where things are. I was talking to Theresa who works at the Holocaust\nMuseum and Teresa had gone to L\u2019 viv, just two years ago and she had some wonderful pictures.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012\nShe also showed me this huge hospital and she said yeah, that was a big Jewish hospital.\nNowhere does it say that it was a Jewish hospital. So that\u2019s, yeah.",
        "A: To the United States? I feel very grateful to the United States.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, very much so. Yeah.",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "A: No. No. I had a period in my life where I was conservative. I really liked young Judea and\nwhat it stood for. And then B\u2019Nai Brith and B\u2019Nai Brith girls and no I\u2019m not religious at all.",
        "A: Absolutely. Oh I feel like Judaism is my core. Mm hm and everything that I feel I stand for is\nthe base is Judaism.",
        "A: My son not at all, not at all. He doesn\u2019t believe in any religion he says. My daughter who is\nalso married to someone who was not Jewish, believes very strongly in raising her son Jewish.\nShe\u2019s kind of eclectic in what she kind of believes but she wants her son to be raised Jewish.\nAnd my grandsons, the older two were bar mitzvahed. Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: I think that I owe the world a great deal. And I think that (pause) that\u2019s kind of been my\nlife\u2019s work in educational equity and even in you know making even the playing field all the way\naround. And I believe in that. And that probably comes from being a survivor. Why did I,\nuseless me, survive when so many good and fabulous people didn\u2019t? But that isn\u2019t the question\nthat can ever be answered. But so yes, I also feel that I was so, so unbelievably lucky. I had\nparents I absolutely adored and were such a huge influence on my life. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yeah, mm hm. Yeah. And I believe I was very, very lucky in my husband who is just\nsuch an incredibly good man. I mean I don\u2019t know many people who \u2014 Larry, Gator said I\nshould ask you because I'd like to bring this kid home to live with us. What do you think? He\nsaid oh if you think it\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok. So we had Gamley who 1s living with us.",
        "A: Here. I was an assistant principal at Blair and this was a kid, one of them was a kid I kicked\nout and then I kicked him out, I suspended him for fighting and he came right back and fought\nthe same kid again. So I had him up for possible expulsion. And he had lots of problems.",
        "A: Mm hm.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 9, 2012",
        "A: It\u2019s not what happens to you. It\u2019s how you react to what happens to you that matters. And that\nI know that they are all bright capable, and strong young men and I know that they will be great\nand how proud and pleased I am to have them.",
