        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Until how old?",
        "A: Un \u2014 about \u2014 yeah, at \u2014 10 years old. Then we moved. For awhile we moved to a\nvery small town, Skodvilla(ph), not far from Taurag\u00e9 because my father was\nappointed a judge there. So, we went there, but we lived very short time, because I\nhad to go to the high school, and that was in Taurag\u00e9. There was no \u2014 none high\nschool in Skodvilla(ph), so I went back to Taurag\u00e9 and lived with some other\npeople, and my parents thought that \u2014",
        "Q: Would this \u2014 excuse me, this would have been middle school? At age 10 would\nyou have been joining high school, or would have been later \u2014",
        "A: Well, in the Lithuanian system, what they called a \u2014 was a grammar school for\nfour years, and then a \u2014 there was what they call high school, which was called\ngymnasium for eight years.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "A: And that was th \u2014 th-the \u2014 the education, and so I \u2014 I went with that so-called\ngymnasium to the first class in Taurag\u00e9, but my parents thought that th-that\narrangement was very unsatisfactory. He requested that he would be transferred to a\n\u2014 the larger city where I could live with my family. And so he took again, he took,\ninstead of being a judge he took again th-the previous position of prosecutor \u2014\nassistant prosecutor I would call, in Panev\u00e9zys, which was a larger city, not much\nmore sophisticated than Taurag\u00e9. Taurag\u00e9 was sophisticated town. I di \u2014",
        "Q: What made it sophisticated?",
        "A: It was very near to the German city, Tilz\u00e9, and there was a lot of traffic between\nTaurag\u00e9 and Tilz\u00e9, and the so-called Lithuania Minor, or Klaip\u00e9dos kraStas was\nalso very near Taurag\u00e9, just a few kilometers away, and the relationship with that\nGerman influence, German cultural influenced area, you know, had an effect on\nTaurag\u00e9 also.",

        "A: We had an influence but I am not aware of any increased friction. There was\ninfluence. The Jewish people were very much concerned, and the Lithuanian people,\nbecause the Germans became quite aggressive in \u2014 in Klaip\u00e9da area, which was \u2014",

        "A: A port city of Lithuania and the third in the size on \u2014 in the country. The capital\ncity Vilnius is first, Kaunas second, and Klaip\u00e9da is the third. And at that time in\nKlaip\u00e9da was, I think the majority of the population in Klaip\u00e9da city, a majority\nmay be German about that time. In the countryside not so. In the countryside\nLithuanians pre-predominated, but they were also very much influenced by the\nGerman culture through it \u2014 through centuries, really, they were under the German\nrule there. And the \u2014 during the \u2014 when the Nazis came to power, they became very\nageressive in that area. They wanted to \u2014 it was part of the Germany before the first\nWorld War, and the Germany wanted to recover that territory, and they very \u2014 b-\nbecame very aggressive against the Lithuanian.

        "Q: Were they close to each other, Taurag\u00e9 and Klaip\u00e9da? As \u2014 as \u2014",
        "A: Klaip\u00e9da not so c-close, but the Klaip\u00e9da area, Klaip\u00e9da territory was quite\nnear. I don\u2019t know how many kilometers, maybe seven, eight kilometers from the\nKlaip\u00e9da area, which was au-autonomous area which had, you know, their own\nlaws, German laws, and their th \u2014 bo-both languages were official, Lithuanian and\nGerman. And so we became that Lithuania is now Lithuanian \u2014 Lithuanian\ncharacter and Lithuanian rule and Lithuania is under attack, under \u2014 under pressure\nwhen the \u2014 when \u2014 when Hitler took over in Germany, right there, because before\nthat there was no such hostility.

But it\nwas discussed, 1t wasn\u2019t discussed in which way, you know, what \u2014 what proves that,\nwhy we \u2014 do we believe it li-like this or something.

My \u2014 my cousin told once,\nyou know, or even several times that, you know, that there are some elements in\nCatholic liturgy which was saved from the old-time Jewish customs and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nwhich the Jews, the rabbinical Jews have lost. So even that the Catholics have\nsomething from the older Jewish religions, 1t was not ant \u2014 anti Jewish at all like its \u2014\nitself, 1t was a discussion of the relationship of the Jewish religion and the Catholic\nreligion \u2014 well, Christian religion, which really split off from \u2014 from the Judaism,\nand why did they split off, and \u2014 well, of course they then \u2014 the \u2014 the person of Jesus\nof Nazareth comes into that. That\u2019s why you know, and what he \u2014 what was his\nmessage basically, and why did they had to split from the Jewish what \u2014 what the\nOctober 14, 2010\nJews had rejected and the Catholics accepted \u2014 I mean Christians accepted.\nSomething like that.",
        "Q: Well, you know, there have been religious discussions about Jewish influence on\nChristian religions that \u2014 that were very broadly accepted in \u2014 in many populations,\nCatholic populations of the \u2014",

        "Q: \u2014 was that something that was part of such discussions and an interpretation in\nsuch way, it was, you know, a sense of did \u2014 not necessarily within your own family,\nbut in the larger community, when Jews were discussed, was that something that\nwould come up?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know in the larger community because tha-that type of discussions were\nkind of inside of the family. Rarely, you know, sometimes we talk with other priests.\nIt was not subject which people would just meet and start discussing like this.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 yes, of course.",
        "A: And \u2014 but in my family in particular when \u2014 when my \u2014 my cousin became a\npriest, you know, those things came up regularly. And there was, yes \u2014 well, there is\nsomething in \u2014 in \u2014 in the gospels which calls about the je \u2014 y-you know, the Jewish\nOctober 14, 2010\npeople demanding that Jesus from Nazareth would be executed. You know, and\nthere was something of that. But it \u2014 my cousin, my \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin also, he was a\nCatholic priest, had no hostility against the Jews as such.

        "Q: And why not? Why do think that was the case?",
        "A: Because of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of this whole relationship which re-resulted in the Polish\narmy seizing the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And my father was at that time in the Lithuanian army, and my mother was in\nVilnius in \u2014 in the foreign industry of Lithuania, had to flee from the advancing\nPolish army, and you know, th-the \u2014 th-they took it personally, really.\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What kind of a place was Panev\u00e9Zys? If we talk about \u2014 you know, I asked about\nTaurag\u00e9, what was its make-up, how would you describe Panev\u00e9zys? How\ndifferent, or similar? Wh-What \u2014 what was this place?",
        "A: For \u2014 for me it was \u2014 it was different. And I came from Taurag\u00e9 and I felt\nsuperior, because it seemed to me like it\u2019s much less sophisticated city, much less\nsophitis \u2014 sophisticated school, and much less sophisticated friends I had in my scho\n\u2014 in my school, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: So I felt, you know \u2014 you know, a loss of Taurag\u00e9, you know\u201d? The interesting\nsophisticated city. Now, there were \u2014 there were some Germans in \u2014 1n pen \u2014 in\nPanev\u00e9zys, but really few of them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There were some Poles, there some Russians, which didn \u2014 we didn\u2019t have in\nTaurag\u00e9. So ethnic \u2014 ethnic \u2014 you know, was completely different. There were a lot\nof Jews in \u2014 in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys, and there was a very small community, but\ninfluential, and a community of Karayims.",
        "Q: Tell us what are Karayims. Who are they?",
        "A: Karayims are \u2014 it seems like they are of Turkish descent. Their language 1s\nsimilar to Turkish language. Racially they look like, you know, like Turks or Tartars,\nbut religiously they are Jews. They are Jews, but they do not accept the talmu \u2014\nTalmudic Judaism. They just accept Torah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And refuse to co \u2014 you know, to accept any other authorities outside of Torah,\nany you know, rabbi\u2019s interpretations, Talmudian [indecipherable], they just reject\nthat.",
        "Q: Okay.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: And the Jews consider them co \u2014 you know, ra \u2014 I think that Jews didn\u2019t consider\nthem really Jews at all. They dom \u2014 do not consider themselves rabbinical Jews. Th-\nThere is a hoso \u2014 there was some hostility between Jews and Karayims.",
        "Q: And yet they were in Lithuania. They somehow or other had \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 arrived there, come there.",
        "A: Well, they were brought here, ye \u2014 to Lithuania, all this \u2014 going through old \u2014\nold history, but Lithuania\u2019s ruler, Vytautas the Great \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 on his \u2014 when he was ruling Lithuania, Lithuania was really an empire\nbecause took a lot of territory up to the Black Sea, and he went to the Crimea, and\nin Crimea there was that Karayim community. And he brought several families, I\nthink 40 or more families to Lithuania with the purpose that they would be his\npersonal guard.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: You see, they\u2019re outside. They\u2019re complete outsiders. They just rely on the grand\ndukes of Lithuania and he 1-is guarding them. He couldn\u2019t trust Lithuanians because\nthere were, you know, well, there were some of his friends, but there was friends of\nhis cousin, who was his rival, and all that kind of thing. The cris \u2014 Lithuania was\nbecoming Christian, there were still old pagans, who didn\u2019t like the ca \u2014 so he \u2014 he\nOctober 14, 2010\nthought that he\u2019d better rely on the people who nobody could even communicate\nwith at the beginning. Well later they learned, of course, Lithuanian language, but \u2014\nbut still, they were \u2014 and they worship his memory even now.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because they \u2014",
        "Q: 500 \u2014 600 years later.",
        "A: Yes. And they were living in Trakai where Vytautas was mostly residing and\nthey had, you know, the duty to \u2014 to protect the castle, go to the guard duty in castle.",
        "Q: So there was thi \u2014 such a small but influential community in Panev\u00e9zZys as well?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: How they came to Panev\u00e9zys, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because they were di \u2014",
        "Q: Describe just a little bit about your high school years. What kind of a high school\nwas it, and \u2014",
        "A: Really, really, my first impression was wrong, the high school was very good,\nyou know, and compared with other Lithuanian high schools was wa \u2014 ca \u2014 was not\nthe first, maybe \u2014 well, of course it wasn\u2019t the first, the first was [indecipherable]\nthe most ad-advanced. But \u2014 but 1t was a very good school, and had very good\nOctober 14, 2010\nteachers, and \u2014 in most of the subjects. And the people were friendly, and so I\nenjoyed that \u2014 that, very much, you know. I was a poor student, because my father\nsend me to grammar school one year earlier. Usually 1-it started at seven, he sent me\nat six. And I was not a good student, neither in Taurag\u00e9, nor in Panev\u00e9zys, until the\nfi \u2014 my fifth class, fifth year class where I w-was left for a year, you know, to repeat\nthe course in \u2014 in that school, because my mathematics we-were not good. Of course\nI was also sick, I missed classes, and so I was le \u2014 let to repeat the course 1n the \u2014 in\nthe first ye \u2014 fifth year. And that helped me a lot. After that I became a good su \u2014\nstudent. So my father overestimated me. I was just an average, exactly as \u2014 as\u2014 I am\n\u2014 lam not\u2014",
        "Q: As you were supposed to be.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. And do you remember what kind of atmosphere there was in these \u2014 30\u2019s, in\nthis town, Panev\u00e9zys, about how many people did it have at that time? Was it \u2014 yes,\nit was a city I believe you told me.",
        "A: Yeah, about to \u2014 I would say, 30,000 maybe.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Maybe more, yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: Or it will be more, would be more, m-maybe 40,000, close to 50.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Something like that.",
        "Q: So in \u2014 1n those terms for such a small country it\u2019s not inconsequential.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What \u2014 what do you remember from those high school years, both\npersonally, and what was going on in the wider society? What kind of discussions,\nwhat kind of events?",
        "A: Well, it was rather quiet years until \u2014 until the situation in Lithuania became\ndangerous, and the first ulttmatum, the Polish ultimatum came through, you know,\nand then the people are aware that the country 1s in danger. And then, of course, was\na lot of discussion and concern, and taking positions and such like \u2014 like that. But\ngeneral \u2014 the relationship between nationalities \u2014 well, I said taura \u2014 Taurag\u00e9 there\nwere no \u2014 no \u2014 no hostility. While in Panev\u00e9zys definitely there was, because there\nwas a Polish gymnasium also.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And there were Poles in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys, and that was already the host \u2014\nho-hostile element, because they were considered disloyal to Lithuanian state.\nMaybe they were not, but the Lithuanians looked at them thi \u2014 with \u2014 with suspicion\nthat they might be disloyal.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Were there any \u2014 were there incidents that would have fed into this, or was this\njust the general accepted point of view?",
        "A: No, there were no particular incidents, but there were na \u2014 th \u2014 our \u2014 the young\npeople, the teenagers, Lithuanian, Polish, we didn\u2019t fight or anything like that, but\nwe ignored each other, mostly.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Sometimes I had some discussion with them, but discussions \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know anybody personally who were \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I met one of them, but no, no, no, I didn\u2019t have any friends in there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. The \u2014 and in \u2014 can you repeat just a little bit, if 1t would be \u2014 or \u2014 or\nexplain just a little bit, what\u2019s the essence, it was a \u2014 was it th-the takeover of\nVilnius that was the reason why there was this friction, or was there something more\nto it, was it a broader, deeper, longer lasting \u2014",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we had the suspicion that the Poles generally were against the\nLithuanian state. That we \u2014 they wanted to recreate the Polish Lithuanian\ncommonwealth. But in the modern times we were susp \u2014 sus \u2014 suspecting that they\njust wanted a \u2014 to annex Lithuania and \u2014 and that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And we felt that they denied, you know, the Lithuanians, in their mind that they\nwere denying our right as \u2014 as a nation to keep our own state with our own capital,\nOctober 14, 2010\nhistorical capital. And that \u2014 that was the hostility. Now, it was quite clear I never,\nyou know, th \u2014 even thought about that, that between Lithuanians and Poles \u2014 b-\nbetween the young people, the teenagers who went to different gymnasium, that\nbetween those gymnasiums there were no \u2014 no relationship really. But I don\u2019t know\nwhy there was no relationship with the Jewish j \u2014 schools which were in \u2014 in\nPanev\u00e9zys.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There were no relations. We had some Jews who went to Lithuanian school, and\nwa \u2014 by class, you know, classmates. But \u2014 and we were fine, we were friends, we\nwere 0-okay. But the relationship between the Jewish gy-gymnasium and Poland \u2014\nand Lithuanian gymnasium was just nonexistent. And I don\u2019t know at \u2014 even now I\ncouldn\u2019t explain why it was so, because there was no such hostility at all, and\nLithuanians considered Jews, you know, the Jews also supported Lithuanian claim to\nVilnius usually, the great majority, I wouldn\u2019t know about all but ye \u2014 th-the great\nmajority was supporting that. And they [indecipherable] Lithuania recovered\nVilnius, the Jewish community was \u2014 was quite friendly, and wh-while the Polish, of\ncourse, people were very hostile.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s take \u2014 let\u2019s start with the years that \u2014 le-let\u2019s go up to these years where\nthings start to get tense. And you\u2019re saying the first one was when \u2014 had to do with\nthe Polish Lithuanian relationship?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Right, 19 eight \u2014",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: \u2014 1938, the \u2014 Poland demanded that Lithuania take up the diplomatic and \u2014 and\neconomic rel-relations with Poland, which would \u2014",
        "Q: Which it hadn\u2019t had until \u2014",
        "A: Which Lithuania didn\u2019t have after \u2014 after Vilnius, you know, was like a\ncompletely \u2014 there were complete \u2014 complete | \u2014 | \u2014 no communication between\nLithuania and Poland.",
        "Q: And Vilnius had been occupied or taken over at what \u2014 what year? It was \u2014",
        "A: 1920.",
        "Q: Nineteen \u2014 so for 18 years there had been no diplomatic relations?",
        "A: Right, right, and the Poles demanded and demanded, you know, with ultimatum.\nThat means, if not, there would be war.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And Lithuania accepted that. The Poles didn\u2019t require that Lithuania renounce\nVilnius as a\u2014 or \u2014 or renounce, you know, Lithuanian claim to Vilnius. It didn\u2019t\nmention Vilnius at all.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It mentioned the relationship. But still Lithuanians felt that 1t was demeaning, that\nit was \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Why do you think that they even \u2014 1938 would have been motivated by it?",
        "A: Well, we suspected that they always want to take over Lithuania eventually.\nThat\u2019s one thing. But at that time, Poland considers itself a great power in Europe\nand Germany just took over Austria and Poland wanted compensation as a great\npower, you know, so at least, you know, they \u2014 they took this step against Lithuania\nto showing that they are also \u2014 can act, you know.",
        "Q: So this was the \u2014 this was how it was perceived basically, in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys, in\nLithuania?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes. And \u2014 and it is right. Now we know, you know, the backgrounds and so, and\nbasically that was \u2014 what was [indecipherable] at that time.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mr. Algimantas Gureckas on October 14\", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, I\nwanted to continue our \u2014 our discussion about \u2014 about the rising tensions in \u2014 in your\nworld, in Panev\u00e9zys, in Lithuania. And we were talking about the Polish\nLithuanian relationship. As you\u2019re speaking, I\u2019m thinking, how much of this did a 15\nyear old boy know, because that\u2019s how old you were in 1938; how much of this was\ndiscussed at home? How much do you \u2014 can you remember that you knew of it at the\ntime?",
        "A: Well, a lot, a lot. It affected everybody, affected my family, you know, and so\nalso affected me. I also felt, you know, that Poles were \u2014 were trying, you know,\nsomehow, you know, to show our superior \u2014 their \u2014 their superior powers, or their\nsuperior might against a smaller country, and didn\u2019t like it. Didn\u2019t like it at all.\nAlthough I was skeptical at that time about Vilnius, you know. I thought well, you\nknow, we are no-not going to recover Vilnius ever. I didn\u2019t tell anybody not \u2014 not\nthat my father, nor \u2014 nor my mother, nor \u2014 nor my friends. But I thought wow, that\u2019s\n\u2014 that\u2019s an unrealistic, we might as well forget about it. But \u2014 but this was then a\nPolish ultimatum, the Polish demand, you know. It still hurt. Still hurt very much,\nyou know.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: I want to also kind of make a remark is, as I\u2019m listening to you, you\u2019re saying that\nthese events, which are political \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 in nature, which are intra-governmental, nevertheless affected your family a\ngreat deal, and I take it to mean affected in a sense of not in a personal way that their\nlives changed from one day to the next.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But their feelings, their \u2014 their s \u2014 their senses and so on were affect \u2014 and that\nspeaks to me of \u2014 of people who were engaged in a civic process.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Because there could have been people who live in a country, as there are today in\nthe United States, and as there are all over the world \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 who \u2014 whose world consists of, I go to work in the morning, I do my job, I\ncome home, I have no interest in \u2014 in politics, or in what goes around me. I can\u2019t\naffect it anyway, and what happens in Washington, what happens in Moscow, is\nnone of my affair, okay? And clearly that was not the dynamic going on in the cir \u2014\nin the \u2014 in the circle of people that you grew up with. Is that so?",
        "A: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true, I\u2014 I\u2014Is\u2014I-\u2014JIam sure that there were such people,\nsuch people are disinterested in \u2014 in \u2014 in politics, interethnic relationships, and so I\nOctober 14, 2010\nam sure there were so, but that was not 1n our \u2014 1n \u2014 in our circle, in our family, in\nthe friends m-my family had.",
        "Q: And why would you \u2014 how would you explain their engagement then? How\nwould you explain their engagement to events that really are outside and beyond\ntheir personal lives? By that \u2014 still at that point, I mean at some point history doesn\u2019t\nim-impact, but how would you explain this interest?",
        "A: In\u20141n such a \u2014 well, as I mentioned before, you know, the \u2014 the family history,\nthe people \u2014 the \u2014 my father\u2019s experience 1-in \u2014 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in the War of Independence,\nand before that he was in Poland during the World War I, you know, an-and the\nrelationship even during that tsarist times, even in their gymnasium, there was\nalready hostility between the Lithuanians and Poles in their classes, he told me. So\nthat \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m asking not so much about that particular relationship, but in \u2014 in a\u2014 I guess\nmore direct way would say, why should your parents care what goes on between\nKaunas and Warsaw, or Kaunas and Moscow, or Kaunas and Berlin? It\u2019s ha \u2014\nyou know, what made your family engaged in caring about these political events, in\ngeneral. Why would you \u2014 how would you explain it?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. But I know that even my grandfather from my\nmother\u2019s side, even he was very committed to the Lithuanian national \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 and ethnic ideal, right. He was working he \u2014 with them, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was\nhelping during the 1905, 1905 there was a revolution in Russia, and in Lithuania it\ntook a national character; Lithuanians against the Russian suppression. So, why \u2014 my\nfather hid, you know, the \u2014 the revolutionaries \u2014 my grandfather.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My mother found out, I mean, that he hid the revolutionaries who were trying to\nget \u2014 when \u2014 when the revolution was suppressed, trying to get into Germany and\nlater maybe to United States to escape from that pole \u2014 tsarist oppression. So, you\nknow, it\u2019s tradition going way back. And I don\u2019t know how to explain. It was a small\ncountry, and the fe \u2014 people felt that, you know, these things really affect them. The\ncountry\u2019s independence was precarious during that time, and of course, I mean, my\nfather was working for the government, so 1-if \u2014 if \u20141f the country is occupied, I\nmean, he has no job. I think maybe that also had something to do. I \u2014 really, we\ndidn\u2019t pose those questions that way, so I am not sure.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s what it seems to me, but \u2014",
        "Q: The other question that comes to mind, and again this 1s in \u2014 in my mind an trony\nbecause I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not as familiar with the history at the time, 1s why would\nPoland be someone you\u2019d be \u2014 there would be more of such negative feelings about\nthan the Soviet Union, which is right next door? What \u2014 well, so is Poland, but \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010\nbut what kind of discussions were going on, what kind of sensibility was there about\nthe Soviet Union? What role did that play in Panev\u00e9zys, you know, and what was\ngoing on? What did you know of what was going on in Soviet Russia, and the union\nitself?",
        "A: We knew some, we knew the \u2014 you know, my ma \u2014 my f-\u2014 my father see the\nbeginnings of the Russian revolution in Russia. I would say so. Again, the Polish\nthing. Soviet Union was supporting Lithuania in this Polish Lithuanian conflict. Or\nsupporting Lithuania\u2019s claim to Vilnius.",
        "Q: All along?",
        "A: All along. The only one of the great powers. The Germans also didn\u2019t recognize\nthe Polish annextion of Vilnius, but the Germans were not willing to, you know, to\ntake stand, or support Lithuania or something like that. So they kept more or less\noutside of that \u2014 of that issue. The Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan supported\nPoland. So the only great power supporting \u2014 United States were behind the area,\nyou know, they didn\u2019t \u2014 it was time of isolation, they didn\u2019t \u2014 tried not to take any\nstance in European affairs at all. So the only real power supporting Lithuania was\nSoviet Union. Now, my parents, being good Catholics and Lithuanians, they\ndisapproved of the communist system as such. But there was little discussion of that,\nyou know, all of the memories of revolution as my father said, I mean he thought\nthat revolution was, of course, a cruel period of time. A lot of things happened, but\nOctober 14, 2010\nhe thought that, you know, after all this time, there was some \u2014 some normality in\nthe country. Even he didn't wanted to believe that there was a constant terror or\nsomething like that. Although, you know, w-we read about the terror in \u2014 against so-\ncalled, you know, the \u2014 the short trials of the c \u2014 other communists against Stalin,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: You read that in the Lithuanian media?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that was \u2014 so di \u2014 that was looked \u2014 people didn\u2019t believe really that all\nthose people, you know, were traitors or something like that, and there was going a\nstruggle for power. But as far as Lithuania is concerned, that was outside of our real\nconcerns.",
        "Q: And did news of the famine in the Ukraine, was there anything like that that \u2014\nthat touched your \u2014",
        "A: N-Not \u2014 we didn\u2019t know a thing about it, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Nothing at all.",
        "Q: In the 30s, as this was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So \u2014 so in other words, from what I get \u2014 a sense I get from you 1s\nthe Soviet Russia, or Soviet Union was rather benign in it \u2014 in a\u2014ina-\u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: That \u2014 that was our \u2014 our impression, mo-most of pre \u2014 impression of my parents,\nof the people they \u2014 they befriended, they discussed those things, yes, that was \u2014 that\ndid p \u2014 it was, you know, a\u2014 was supporting us.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: For our right cause, we imagined that the Lithuanian cause was \u2014",
        "Q: The right one.",
        "A: \u2014 aright cause, so \u2014",
        "Q: So, what happens after 1938? We\u2019re finished with Poland. Poland requires this\nultimatums \u2014 says this ultimatum, requires diplomatic relations. Everybody\u2019s upset,\nbut they acquiesce.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What happens then?",
        "A: Well, the next year the Germans demanded the Klaip\u00e9da area.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And?",
        "A: Well, that was another shock. You know, the Lithuanian \u2014 c-clearly you couldn\u2019t\nfight against Germany with any \u2014 with any s \u2014 you know, possibility of keeping glu\n\u2014 Klaip\u00e9da, so they took over Klaip\u00e9da, and that was the first occupation of\nLithuanian territory, and that was first \u2014 the refugees we met. The Jewish people,\nand the Lithuanian people who were committed to Lithuanian cause became\nrefugees. They didn\u2019t want \u2014 and Panev\u00e9zys, they came even to Panev\u00e9zys, the\nOctober 14, 2010\npeople. And there were appeals, you know, that \u2014 you know, for living space, for\nother things, for jobs for those refugees. So my parents decided, you know, that we\nhad a nice house, it was our own house. We have too much space, we can \u2014 we could\nrent, you know, the upstairs, you know, to somebody. And we rent it to a girl who\ncame from Klaip\u00e9da as a refugee, and well, simply, we \u2014 he \u2014 she worked in \u2014 in \u2014\nin Misetas(ph) co-company, you know.",
        "Q: Misetas(ph) company.",
        "A: As a clerk, you know, as a clerk, you know, so th-that was a refugee, we came to\nour \u2014 to our house. And there were more those refugees, one of my father\u2019s \u2014 th-the\nlegal students who were taking practice with my father was also from Lithuania\nMinor, and he came, you know, to work there, so we met him directly, and of course\nthe Jewish people took care of the Jewish refugees \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, who came from Klaip\u00e9da.",
        "Q: Okay, so wa \u2014 so it was still sort of separate communities, it was not an integrated\nsense of these are all Lithuanian citizens, but it was more, each takes care of its own.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: It just happens naturally like that.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And who was this girl who came from Klaip\u00e9da? Did you talk to her?",
        "A: Yeah, shu \u2014",
        "Q: Did she tell you about what had been going on there, and what she saw, and\nthings like that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, she did.",
        "Q: What did she say?",
        "A: She \u2014 she was not from the \u2014 that area. She was from | \u2014 from Lithuania, she was\nCatholic, you know, Lithuanian \u2014 Lithuanians from Lithuania Minor are usually\nLutherans. She ca \u2014 when a young girl she came to Klaip\u00e9da to work there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And now she became a refugee, because she \u2014 she lived for years there, you\nknow, and \u2014 and came back. So she told, you know, about the \u2014 the Nazis, how they\nacted there, you know, how they at-attacked Lithuanians and Lithuanian institutions.\nThey became more and more, you know, aggressive as the time went on, until it was,\nyou know, really a problem for the Lithuanian even to exist there. The Nazis were\ntrying to, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to dominate that area at all, and of course, you\nknow, they demanded Klaip\u00e9da for Germany, and Lithuania couldn\u2019t resist, and\nyou know, they \u2014 they just had to flee that \u2014 that country. Hitler himself came to\nOctober 14, 2010\nKlaip\u00e9da, you know, and well, was a very sad moment for Lithuania, but we felt\nthat\u2019s \u2014 it was a superior \u2014 superior power, couldn\u2019t do much about it.",
        "Q: Were there any people that you knew of in Lithuania who were Lithuanians who\nsupported Hitler? Who thought that the 1 \u2014 that the ideology of the Nazi party was\none that had some positive attributes?",
        "A: Ye-es, yes, but not in our circle, in our family circle. The closest I know was our\nCatholic priest, a teacher of religion in our school. He was impressed by the order\nand discipline of the Nazi movement, and during the lessons, you know, sometimes\nhe made Germany \u2014 the Nazi Germany as an example of, you know, of a\ndisciplined, purposeful society. But that was really ther \u2014 we heard about other\npeople, you know, who \u2014 who were f-friendly to Germans, but there were very, very\nfew of them, because Lithuania was under direct attack at that time, with Klaip\u00e9da.\nEverybody was very sad that Klaip\u00e9da was lost.",
        "Q: Okay. What \u2014 and you were, by that point, 16 years old?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And how \u2014 is your life changing at all? I mean, your personal life, do things keep\non going the way they should be, even in spite of these \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes. It didn\u2019t \u2014 my personal life didn\u2019t in \u2014 didn\u2019t change m \u2014 at all.",
        "Q: What happened next, that you remember?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Well, the next thing was that summer, 1939, from ow \u2014 ou-our school, there was\nan excursion to Vilnius, because the diplomatic relations were established, the\ncommunications were already established, you know, we could \u2014 we could go to\nVilnius, you know, to visit the city. So my \u2014 my school decided to have an\nexcursion. So, I to \u2014 my parents, you know, agreed that they had to pay some money,\nI don\u2019t know, for that, but they agreed that I go on that excursion, and I went with a\ngroup of my classmates to \u2014 to Vilnius. And it made a great impression on me, the\ncity. The great impression of the old Lithuanian history connected to the city, where\nthere were signs all around. The Lithuanian coat of arms, you know, was on the city\ngate. Ancient.",
        "Q: There was a \u2014 there was a \u2014 still a city gate in 1939?",
        "A: One. One. Yeah, one was \u2014 because AuSros Vartai, it wou \u2014 had \u2014 it had the\nchapel, had some religious meaning, so it \u2014 the gate was not demolished, all other\ngates were.",
        "Q: AuSros Vartai means in English, Gates of Dawn, yes?",
        "A: Gates of Dawn \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but I think it was Lithuanian mistranslation auSros, it should be aus-\naustrayo(ph), I think where \u2014 meant \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 well, it\u2019s \u2014 now it AuSros Vartai, so whatever.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, but \u2014 but an-anywhere else, at the churches, at the bridges, we could see our \u2014\nthe coat of arms of our country. The old ones. Of course, the new offices had Polish\nsigns, but nothing has \u2014 did \u2014 as far as history \u2014 well, there was some in\ncombination, when the co-countries \u2014 was a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth while\nthe countries were united in one commonwealth, there was a \u2014 also a no \u2014 Polish\neagle, Lithuanian knight, and so on, you know, bi \u2014 from those times. But always,\nalways the Lithuanian knight. And [indecipherable] thing, and so Lithuanian\nstudents met our excursion, and he was a leader of our excursion, so the city told\nabout how Lithuanians lived under the Poles, you know, and we went to Lithuanian\ns-s \u2014 girls\u2019 school, the girls \u2014 the \u2014 it was summer, so the girls went home, so the\nschool was empty, so \u2014 but they accommodated us. So we were \u2014 we still in Vilnius\nwere in midst of the Lithuanian community there, which was very small, and really\noppressed, but they were proud because they felt that they were oppressed, and they\nwere right that there was something wrong, you know, with the Polish government,\nthat they \u2014 they were oppressing the Lithuanians anyways.",
        "Q: Did they have their own schools, though, Lithuanian language schools in Poland,\nor \u2014 or you don\u2019t know about that?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 they had some, but there were \u2014 one of the \u2014 the other were, they\nclosing those schools, and they had the one high school in Vilnius itself.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Just the only one. There were bef \u2014 many more before, but they were closed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But in Vilnius there was one.",
        "Q: So in some ways this 1939 summer excursion is both an \u2014 something new,\nbecause you get to see the city for the first time in your life.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a summer vacation, and it\u2019s positive.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something that you see of \u2014 that you can relate to and identify with.\nAnd at the same time it\u2019s the summer of 1939.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Which is not exactly a summer without tension.",
        "A: Oh yeah, in Vilnius was \u2014 in Lithuania that was not that obvious, but in Vilnius,\nyes.",
        "Q: How did you feel it in Vilnius?",
        "A: Well, there were \u2014 there were all po \u2014 oh, there\u2019s su-such like \u2014 first of all, there\nwere military demonstrations of the Poles. There were parades. We were, you know,\nOctober 14, 2010\nlooking at one of the parades 1-in Vilnius, of artillery regiment there, and we were\ncomparing that because there was artillery regiment in Panev\u00e9zys also. So we were\ncomparing how it is and we looked, you know, boy, our soldiers look much more,\nyou know, much better, better clothes, better \u2014 and didn\u2019t impress us as \u2014 at all. But\nthere were also the signs all over the Vilnius that \u2014 in Polish \u2014 that we are not going\nto retreat from our seashore. And they were \u2014 they were ready to fight. They we \u2014\nknew the war is coming, or at least suspected the war is coming, and they \u2014 they are\nnot going like the Czechs or Lithuanians who gave up Klaip\u00e9da, or the Czechs who\ngave up the Sudetenland, they are going to fight. They are not going to give in to\nthe Nazis \u2014 to the \u2014 Nazis they didn\u2019t mention that, just to the Germans.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 so it was obvious, the war is coming.",
        "Q: To you?",
        "A: Which was not obvious in Panev\u00e9zys \u2014",
        "Q: And Panev\u00e9zys is two hours away.",
        "A: Yes, but this was quite, you know, quite my place. And here, you know \u2014 and we\nmet one Polish girl, who was just graduated from \u2014 from the high school and was\nvisiting her relatives in Vilnius, and we talked with her, you know, and beca \u2014 she\nwas very friendly, we talked in German with her.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: And she knew German, and she knew, you know, that the war is coming, but he \u2014\nshe didn\u2019t think, you know, about all those horrible things. So \u2014 so what, you know?\nWhat \u2014 what are the Germans going to do to me, you know? Well, nothing, you\nknow. It doesn\u2019t matter, you know, so \u2014",
        "Q: Well, this is somewhat of what I was getting at earlier, is that, you know, some\npeople say wa \u2014 some people will say, there\u2019s all this high politics going on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How does it touch me, a simple person?",
        "A: Well, for that girl, didn\u2019t touch it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Sh \u2014 she didn\u2019t care. I am sure, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 it touched her terribly, eventually.",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: And pretty soon. Just a few months.",
        "Q: Yeah. So this is where you started to feel that there\u2019s something going on, in \u2014\nwhen you went on this summer excursion to Vilnius?",
        "A: Yes, it changed my opinion. As I said, I was skeptical about Lithuanian claim to\nVilnius because it\u2019s \u2014 it might be right, but it seemed too unrealistic to me. But after\nthis excursion I changed my opinion completely.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: In what way? That this 1 \u2014 that\u2019s what the Lithuanian capital is. I mean, the Poles\ntook it over, but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what it \u2014 the capital is. That\u2019s what the Lithuanian\nlaw says, that\u2019s what\u2019s Lithuanian constitution said. The capital city of Vilnius is\nLithuania\u2019s capital. So \u2014 and I thought that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what it is. Maybe \u2014\nmaybe we d-don\u2019t recover the Vilnius, I don\u2019t know, you know, but \u2014",
        "Q: Also, before then \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but then, doesn\u2019t change.",
        "Q: \u2014 you had e \u2014 you had \u2014 before then, you hadn\u2019t necessarily been convinced of\nthis argument.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: But at that point, once you went there and you saw these signs, that these were \u2014\nthat there was so much that was of Lithuanian \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 history there, and Lithuanian presence there, that yes, it is \u2014 it is the rightful\ncapital.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay. You go back to Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: What happens after that? You know, there\u2019s the summer, and then September\nfirst comes. September first is not that long after your summer \u2014",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: \u2014 excursion. So, how did events play out? What happened back in Panev\u00e9zys,\nonce you returned from the trip?",
        "A: Yeah, first of all, as far as I am concerned, a lot of people, starting with my\nfamily, with my father and more my m-mother, were very much interested in my\nexperience, in my \u2014",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: \u2014 and even the people who \u2014 who were friendly with our family, the other\nfamilies also were very much interested in that experience. Nobody saw Vilnius for\n19 years, and now suddenly, you know, I saw that \u2014 that city, and everybody wanted\n\u2014 and even Lithuanian officers were interested, in my opinion how did the Polish\narmy look to me? You know, and all that kind of thing, you know. I was \u2014",
        "Q: You were pretty much the hero.",
        "A: \u2014a center of attention.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Th \u2014 that \u2014 I\u2014 I was just \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s not bad.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, no, well, I\u2014 I was just so \u2014 so proud, you know. Not so proud, but I tried to\nbe, you know, controlled about it, but I felt very well about that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, that I had that experience. And then suddenly in [indecipherable] th-\nthe \u2014 the vacation was ending, but the school didn\u2019t start yet. School starts on\nSeptember the first. But the week before I went to the gymnasium, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, I met some of my friends and there, you know, I found out before \u2014 before the\nnewspapers came out, or something like that, I found out about Ribbentrop-\nMolotov agreement.",
        "Q: And what was the militor \u2014 Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement?",
        "A: Well, it was that they committed themselves, both countries \u2014",
        "Q: Who were these countries?",
        "A: Germany and Soviet Union committed themselves not to fight against each\nother, even in a c \u2014 1n a cong \u2014 if the conflict with a third countries comes, that they\nwouldn\u2019t be involved, they would keep neutrality in that conf-conflict. So, since we\nknew that there were discussions between British and French and the Soviets, ho-\nhow to stand up against German ag-agegression, suddenly this disappeared, you\nknow, suddenly Soviets Union said no, we are not going to make a stand. And the\nBritish and French, you know, just \u2014 just went home. That was the whole power\nsituation. And the people thought that if there would be agreement between Great\nOctober 14, 2010\nBritain, France and the Soviet Union, that there would be no war, because the\nsuperiority of this combination should have been clear even to Hitler. So they\nthought, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So are these discussions, you know, I \u2014 it still is hard for me to imagine that a 16\n\u2014 by now 16 year old boy \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 1s thinking like this at that time. What I can imagine 1s that a 16 year old boy is\nlistening to grown-ups talk like this at that time.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, but af-after \u2014 after visit to Vilnius I became political.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Before that, I \u2014 yeah, I heard th \u2014 I was interested in those things, but you know,\nnot \u2014 not that much.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But ah \u2014 ah \u2014 at that point, you know, I became \u2014 I be \u2014 really interested in what\nwas going on.",
        "Q: So when you her \u2014 hear, a week from school \u2014 before school starts, that there is\nthis Molotov-Ribbentrop pact \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you \u2014 you go to, where was it, your school area, even though it hadn\u2019t\nbegun, 1s this where you learned of it?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: From my friends.",
        "Q: From your friends.",
        "A: From my friends, yeah.",
        "Q: Your friends. And your friends are your same a \u2014 they \u2014 about the same age?",
        "A: Yeah, the same age. Well, they heard on the radio or something, but they, also\ntheir parents.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Their parents. I \u2014 we \u2014 we started discussing, I said no, so what, I mean, so what?\nThere is no wars on, does it matter much? And my friend said, you know, well, my\nfather said that, you know, this means war. Because, you know, the Germans were\nma \u2014 will be not d-deterred by the superior power of three great countries, Great\nBritain, France and Soviet Union. So that means the war is coming. That was his\nfather\u2019s opinion [inaudible]",
        "Q: And you\u2019re sharing it with your si\u2014 we \u2014 amongst yourselves \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 at that time.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s all \u2014 so we \u2014 we didn\u2019t deduct ourselves really \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 but it came from our parent in the generation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: From our parents.",
        "Q: All right, so this is a \u2014",
        "A: In this case my friend\u2019s parent, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So here we are.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a week before September first.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then what happens?",
        "A: And then the school started September first, and the war started, of course, and\nthat was news, and everybody was listening to the radio, and everybody was\nfollowing what\u2019s going on, and quite soon it was clear, you know, o-of the German\nsuperiority, which we thought even before. I didn\u2019t see it, but other people saw the\nGerman army in Klaip\u00e9da. We saw Polish army in \u2014 in Vilnius, and it was obvious,\nyou know, that the Germans were much better prepared, and much stronger army\nthan the Poles, and even before the war started, we thought that the Poles are going\nto lose the war. And of course, we \u2014 we kids, you know, were, because of that\nhostility with the Poles, we thought that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a nice time for Lithuania to\nrecover Vilnius. The Germans are attacking Poland and pole \u2014 Polish army\nOctober 14, 2010\ndefinitely is losing, like in the first days it was quite obvious a German attack was,\nyou know, the Blitzkrieg. They \u2014 they went very, very strongly wi-with air \u2014 air\nattacks, armored formations. So we thought well, you know, why Lithuanian army\ndoesn\u2019t go there and recover Vilnius, because Poles will be not able to resist any\nmore.",
        "Q: Was there any sentiment of changing, I mean any voices amongst Lithuanians\nthat said well, maybe we didn\u2019t like the Poles very much for what they did, but my\nGod, what\u2019s happening in Poland, and it\u2019s terrible? Was that \u2014 was there any\nsympathy being expressed in the so \u2014 in those circles that you were in, of Poland\u2019s\ngetting it now, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not easy?",
        "A: Not in the those circles I was in.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not in my co \u2014 friends, classmates, no. Not in my family. But, our director of-of\nour school told us Germans are not going to win this war. It is world war, and the\nGermans are going to lose, and we shouldn\u2019t interfere in the war now. He didn\u2019t say\nthat, you know, he \u2014 he simp \u2014 in sympathy with Poles or something. Maybe he was,\nI don\u2019t know. But he was convinced that the Nazis are going to lose. And it seems\nlike not some kind of a military or \u2014 or \u2014 or economical analysis, but because the\nNazi ideology, that generation knew Germans from the first occupation during the\nfirst World War. And they were convinced that the Germans were always overdoing.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Overreaching themselves?",
        "A: Overreaching. In the first World War, and from the Nazi ideology they deducted\nthat the Nazis are ric \u2014 ready to do the same thing, to overreach more, even more\nthan the \u2014 during the first World War. So they were \u2014 and our president, Antanas\nSmetona also was of that opinion. Some of the officers of Lithuanian army, some o-\nof the diplomats said, I mean, it\u2019s a chance to recover Vilnius, let\u2019s go, and Germans\nwere encouraging Lithuanians, encouraging, you know, that wil \u2014 Lithuania wil \u2014\nwould go and recover Vilnius. And the British said, in that case, Great Britain will\ndeclare war against Lithuania. But well, now this is the question, who will de \u2014 will\nwin the war, and Smetona was convinced that Germans are going to lose, and he\ndidn't \u2014 we didn\u2019t know about that time, but we knew, you know, later, that Smetona\nwas against that, and that\u2019s why Lithuania didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t attack Poland at that\ntime, because of Smetona and of thinking, which our director told to us\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Would you say, you know, would you say your family belonged to a particular\nkind of political wing in Lithuania, or was it fairly typical of, let\u2019s say the mood in\nsociety? From what I understand there was a Christian democrat, and a more\nnationalist, or national political forces.",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Which one would your family would have \u2014 thought they would have identified\nwith more?",
        "A: My father was close to Christian democrats.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But he didn\u2019t belong to the party. And later he drifted closer to this national\nmovement of Smetona, of the president, but he was also critical of Smetona quite a\nb \u2014 a bit, but \u2014 but he was like in between those two. Now, from my mother\u2019s side,\neverybody was Smetona\u2019s.",
        "Q: So they were much more of a \u2014 of \u2014 from the national \u2014",
        "A: Yes, from \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 starting from my grandfather, through all those brothers, you know, everybody,\nincluding my mother was from the national group of [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Would you have called them nationalists?",
        "A: Translating would be, yes, but they were not any kind of Nazis, they were anti \u2014\nanti Nazi, anti-German. And there were, you know, some \u2014 s-some who \u2014 wh-who\nwere pro-German, and pro-Nazi, like Waldemartas(ph) and so, but 1-it \u2014 it \u2014\nSmetona was hostile to that \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 that type of thinking, and \u2014 and those who followed Smetona was hostile\nagainst the Nazi thinking, not only as \u2014 as German, but generally against Nazi and\nfascist things. Fascism of Italian type had more sympathies. There were not too\nmany, but Italians type was closer. There was no racism in \u2014 in Italy, in \u2014 at least at\nthe beginning, na \u2014 and \u2014 so, but in \u2014 in \u2014 in our circles, no, you know, there was no\n\u2014no sympathy for the Nazis.",
        "Q: And yet \u2014 and yet, there was temptation \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 that \u2014 that this \u2014 this, let\u2019s say encouragement, on behalf of the Nazis to then\ntake Vilnius \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 was tempting. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t something that was dismissed as we just\ndon\u2019t do that, unless fa \u2014 is \u2014 until Smetona said so.",
        "A: Right. Smetona, well, is not \u2014 he 1s not the only one. Also, as I said, our \u2014\ndirector of our school also was of that opinion, and \u2014 and there was other people,\nolder people who said, you know, don\u2019t do that. Now, even if Lithuania would have\nattacked Vilnius, that doesn\u2019t mean that it would be pro-Nazi because he is all \u2014 th-\nthe Soviet Union supported Lithuania in the Polish-Lithuanian \u2014",
        "Q: Conflict.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 conflict, and here also, you know, Lithuanian \u2014 Germany would have became\n\u2014 become allies for that moment, but lith \u2014 from Lithuanian viewpoint it would be\njust like alliance between Finns and Germans, you know. Not \u2014 they \u2014 Finns didn\u2019t\nbecame Nazis at all, they were allies during the second World War with the\nGermans, but they still were a democratic country, and had nothing to do with the\nNazi ideology at all. So that was the idea. Of course, it was unrealistic. If \u2014 1f would\nhave happened, of course, Nazis would have taken everything that \u2014 but the hope\nwas that, you know, well, so we are allies, just like we were allies with the Soviets,\nnow we\u2019re allies with the Germans. But S-Smetona was against that, Smetona was\na very strong leader, maybe a d \u2014 we could call it dictator, and without him, you\nknow, nothing \u2014 nothing happens.",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014 so the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is \u2014 is \u2014what you hear of is between\nnon-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what becomes [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s what we knew, and there was [indecipherable] so nobody kne-knew\nabout them.",
        "Q: Okay. So what happens later, 1n the early fall, as things progress, and \u2014 wha \u2014\nhow does life in Panev\u00e9Zys change? Or does it?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, of it \u2014 it does. First of all, the war, you know, the \u2014 some of the things, the\ncommerce became affected. There were some Lithuanian ships which were ru-run on\nthe mines, and we \u2014 one of the sailors, a brother of our classmate came back, I mean\nhis ship was sunk in the Baltic Sea because ran on the mine. It\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: It hit a mine. It hit a mine.",
        "A: Well, hit a mine, well, there were non-contact mines also, you know at that time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But that\u2019s a technical thing, so anyway, I mean th-the ship was blown out of the \u2014",
        "Q: Of the water.",
        "A: \u2014 of the water, right. So, you know. And then of course \u2014 and of course the ca \u2014\nthe concern whether Lithuania could become \u2014 still be ne \u2014 neutral when such a gr-\ngreat war is starting around. And when the Soviets attacked Poland also, from the\neast, then everybody became concerned what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s now. Because the Soviets\nare taking over all the eastern portion of Poland \u2014 well, really the Ukrainians,\nByelorussians and Lithuanians living there, but doesn\u2019t matter, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 was\nstill Poland. They took Vilnius, the Soviets, and now, you know, everybody became\n\u2014now we are involved. Soviets recognize Vilnius as Lithuania\u2019s capital, now they\n\u2014 are they going to turn it over to us, or will they find, you know, some kind of thing\nto \u2014 to get out of it, of the \u2014 the commitment. And there was mobilization. There was\ndeclared, you know, the Lithuanian army was mobilized to protect its neutrality, not\nOctober 14, 2010\nfor war. But the Polish army, you know, went over the boundary to Lithuania and\nwas disarmed, so they had \u2014 Lithuania army had to be there to disarm the Polish\narmy coming over, and to intern them as the neutral country\u2019s supposed to do in such\ncase. And a lot of Polish military came over, and refugees \u2014 generally refugees, not\nmilitary refugees from Poland came to Lithuania, and they found quite \u2014 quite a bit\nof understanding and sympathy then, you know. Poland was defeated and broken\nand then, you know, it seemed like, you know \u2014 not \u2014 not an enemy any more you\nhad to fight, you know. So the \u2014 there was sympathy for them and \u2014 and \u2014 and all the\nroutine mobilization, we thought wi \u2014 the Lithuanian army being mobilized that they\nwill go to Vilnius. And we \u2014 we were all, in our class I think everybody was, you\nknow, why our army 1s not going there? But as I said, the director explained to us,\nwe didn't believe him, but that\u2019s what it was, the older generation decided it would\nbe foolish to get into that war. And \u2014 but then we were very much tol \u2014 concerned,\nwhat will be next, you know, everybody was concerned. There was organization, so-\ncalled Sauliai(ph).",
        "Q: What is it? How would you translate it?",
        "A: It is close to national guard, p-partly like a reserves, part like national guard.\nThere was a military people a-after they served in the army, they were released into\nreserves, and they voluntarily joined that organization, which was a military\norganization, but not quite. It differs, for instance, from the national guard in that\nOctober 14, 2010\nwas \u2014 that he \u2014 they had also cultural thing. They had dances, they had lectures also,\nyou know.",
        "Q: So it was somewhat civic?",
        "A: Somewhat civic, yeah. But it was very popular, a lot of people in the \u2014 men, and\nalso women belonged to that organization. And it\u2019s also part \u2014 was part of the \u2014 of\nthe country\u2019s military capa \u2014 ca \u2014 capacity, and so \u2014 and we were a-also our \u2014 the\nstudents of \u2014 in the high school, in the higher classes, now also belonged to that\norganization. I belonged too, voluntarily, whoever wanted, there was no pressure at\nall to join, but I joined it. And we were also called to duty then.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then the mobilization came and we were sent to \u2014 on the guard duty in \u2014 in the\ncity as a\u2014 I\u2019m writing in my memoirs, there will be no \u2014 our students were not quite\nmilitary minded at all, you know, they might have m-made \u2014 made a \u2014 a \u2014 a play out\nof it, and it was a serious thing, so we \u2014 we were removed from the guard duty and\nsent to a place where there were no people.",
        "Q: Well, what do you mean by made a play out of it, they \u2014 they \u2014",
        "A: Well, they were starting, the girls were going to \u2014 to the school o-on \u2014 through\nthe bridge \u2014 the bridge, they were supposed to guard the bridge. They started on, you\nknow, ch-checking their bags and all that kind of thing, and it was a flirt really. And\nit was \u2014 and when \u2014 when the leaders found out, they were terrified. They said, I\nOctober 14, 2010\nmean, the p \u2014 the parents will complain, so we will go before court martial for this\nthing, you know. So they took off of \u2014 of duty us completely and sent to guard\ngasoline tanks and \u2014 and outside place. They want \u2014",
        "Q: Where there were no girls whose bags you could check.",
        "A: No girls, no. And no people at all, just a gr-great, friendly dog who came to visit\nus, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Okay. So that is how, in the early fall, things seemed to be developing.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What happens next?",
        "A: Well, mobilization was called off, we came back to our classes. Our cl \u2014 school\nwas taking over for \u2014 for military ca \u2014 no, the girls\u2019 school was taking over for the \u2014\nthe military. The girls went to our school in the daytime, we went during the\nnighttime to our school, because it was different schools, girl and \u2014 and boys\u2019\nschool. And \u2014 but it was a short period of time, and of course there was news that,\nyou know, Lithuania is recovering Vilnius, Soviets are letting have Vilnius for\nLithuania. Not all the territory which Lithuania claimed and the Soviets recognized\nbefore, you know, they \u2014 they just returned a quarter of the territory, but with the\ncapital city. And also was news that, you know, the military bases, Soviet military\nbases will be introduced in Lithuania. The Soviets will have military bases in\nLithuania. So, everybody was really happy that Vilnius is returning to Lithuania,\nOctober 14, 2010\nand everybody was concerned that the Soviet army is being introduced in Lithuania\nand having bases here. It was not a big surprise really, because before that Estonia\nand Latvia already were forced. They didn\u2019t get anything, but they had to take in\nSoviet bases, Soviet guard [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you know that in Panev\u00e9zys at the time?",
        "A: Yes, yes, that was in the news, in the newspapers, everybody. So, Estonia first,\nLatvia second, Lithuania after that.",
        "Q: Id like to interrupt here and say, you know, when Germany at \u2014\n[background conversation, tape break]",
        "Q: Okay, this is a continuation of our interview with Algimantas Gureckas on\nOctober 14\", 2010. So, Mr. Gureckas, you were at the point where you were\nexplaining the introduction of Soviet military bases in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia\nhad them. I wanted to go back for a minute to the first declaration of war, when\nPoland was attacked by Nazi Germany and then 1s also attacked by the Soviet\nUnion.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you know \u2014 was there a sense, did you \u2014 was there any discussion or did you\nhave a feeling about \u2014 I\u2019m doing all of this as a preface, what the Jewish community\nwas thinking, how people in the Jewish community were reacting to these events, the\nlocal Jewish community in Panev\u00e9zys. Was there any \u2014 any knowledge \u2014 I mean, I\nOctober 14, 2010\ndon\u2019t have a sense that you know, was much contact, but did you \u2014 do you remember\nanything about that?",
        "A: Well, personally I didn't have, at that time, connections. We had Jewish friends in\nour \u2014 in our class, but \u2014 and one was fairly close to me, but we somehow didn\u2019t\ndiscuss much about this situation. But it was from my parents\u2019 contacts, we knew\nthat, of course the Jews were concerned about the German attack, and the German\nstrength, which they showed, you know, and the power. And of course everybody\nknew how hostile the Nazis are against \u2014 against the Jews. So, the concern was quite\nstunder \u2014 understandable. But that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s about \u2014 about it. I mean, there were\nconcern, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t know. Of course they \u2014 they were not in favor that Lithuania would\nattack Poland, you know, but [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So-\u2014 so it seemed \u2014 so I\u2014 I don\u2019t know. I could transfer my [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I had no \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. So, when we\u2019re talking about those military bases, you \u2014 you get the news\nin school. Do you remember how you got the news that Vilnius is going to come\nback into Lithuanian control, do you remember where you were?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh, everybody was at \u2014 at the radios at that time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We [indecipherable] the Lithuanian delegation, government delegation was in\nMoscow.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So we knew that it will be decided one way or the other, and so everybody was\njust glued to the radio and listening when the end \u2014 when it was announced, you\nknow, the news, and eventually it was, you know, that this \u2014 the treaty between\nLithuania and Soviet Union is signed and Vilnius is really \u2014 really turned to\nLithuania, and the military garrisons will be introduced in Lithuania, Soviet\nmilitary.",
        "Q: What date was this, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: It was, yeah, it was 1939, October 10\" was they signed the treaty and we knew\nabout that October 11\", in the morning, from the radio.",
        "Q: From the radio.",
        "A: Yeah, and then, of course, newspapers. And the newspapers were a great\ndisappointment because they showed new boundary between Lithuania and the\nSoviet Union, and as I said, I mean, just a quarter of the territory was being returned\nto Lithuania, three-quarters was just kept, Stalin for themself. And the problem is\nthat the Lithuanian areas were the farmers, and generally the population was\nOctober 14, 2010\nLithuanian in that area. They fell to the \u2014 to th \u2014 to the Soviet side, you know.\nLithuania didn\u2019t receive even those territories which were ethnically Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Are these \u2014 was this part of Belarus, where these \u2014",
        "A: It became part of Belarus then.",
        "Q: \u2014 [indecipherable] Belarus, mm-hm.",
        "A: Par \u2014 became part of Belarus. Later the boundary was adjusted when Lithuania\nwas occupied, but the areas like Druskininkai, like Sven\u00e9ionys, they were part of\nBelarus \u2014 Belarus at that time.",
        "Q: So you got bad \u2014 good news, bad news basically \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 October 11\".",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. So the \u2014 the enthusiasm was \u2014 was k-kind of muted at\nthat point, and there was a meeting, you know, and 1-it was muted, until really the\nSoviets \u2014 Soviets kept Vilnius for a couple of weeks yet, and they were r-really\nplundering the ke \u2014 the city during that time, and eventually the Lithuanian army\ntook over Vilnius. And s-somehow you know, at that point, when Lithuanian army\nmarched into Vilnius, the country became split personality, the people said now we\nare going to celebrate, we are going to worry tomorrow. Everybody knew that there\nis a lot of to \u2014 something to worry, but today we are celebrating, tomorrow we are \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010\nare g \u2014 are going to worry. And that\u2019s what we did, we celebrated and then we\nstarted to \u2014 to worry right away after that, after the celebration.",
        "Q: And \u2014 okay, so now Lithuania\u2019s in Vilnius.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 when was the first time you saw a Soviet soldier?",
        "A: Oh, that was an accident, the \u2014 well, again, after Lithuania \u2014 the Soviets had\ncalled the government delegation from Finland in \u2014 into Moscow and started\ndiscussions with the Finns, and they had also, you know, demands, which the Finns\nre \u2014 refused. So, in \u2014 in a month\u2019s time the Soviets attacked Finland and became\nFinnish Winter War. And now everybody was for Finns in Lithuania. Soviet Union\nwas supposed to be our ally, and well, ally, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we still were for the Finns,\nthey were so \u2014 so heroically defending their country, you just couldn\u2019t help it. Now,\none of the Soviet planes was bombing Helsinki, ar \u2014 or some other Finnish cities,\nanyway, was one bomb \u2014 on the bombing raid. The Finns were shooting back, and\nthe p \u2014 the pa \u2014 the plane was damaged, couldn\u2019t navigate very well, but turned\nsouth, went over Estonia, Latvia, came to Lithuania and near Panev\u00e9zys, crashed.\nWell, really, crash landed, I would say.",
        "Q: Crash landed, okay.",
        "A: Crash landed. The pilots came out and said, I mean, how far is Riga? Well, they\nflew over Riga already, but they couldn\u2019t tell any more. So, the Soviets from their\nOctober 14, 2010\nbarra \u2014 from their military bases in Lithuania came, the Soviet soldiers to that place,\ndismantled the plane and brought it to the railroad station and took it. And we saw\nthen that plane, it went through our gymnasium, through the street in front of us.\nEverybody was at the \u2014 at the window, and we saw the plane, all warped by bullets,\nwhich wa \u2014 wa \u2014 that \u2014 and we saw Soviet soldiers taking that plane away. So that\nwas the first time we saw the Soviet soldiers, taking away that damaged plane.",
        "Q: So y \u2014 so you \u2014 the \u2014 so, in other words, the garrison had already been\nestablished, but you just hadn\u2019t seen them yet.",
        "A: No \u2014 yeah, th-they were \u2014 they were close, they were \u2014",
        "Q: They were close.",
        "A: \u2014 they were \u2014 they were not \u2014 not \u2014 not going to be \u2014 to the streets or anything\nlike that. There were \u2014 there were garrisons who were there, but they were closed.",
        "Q: Closed.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t let their soldiers room around \u2014 roam around at all.",
        "Q: Okay. And that plane is what you see, and it\u2019s in \u2014 and it\u2019s in bits and pieces, and\nit goes by your school window, and it\u2019s of great curiosity to everybody.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. Also a bittersweet thing, because you know, w-we like to see the \u2014 the\nplane warped by the Finnish bullets, but then the so \u2014 Soviet soldiers in Lithuania\nwas, you know, a bitter part of it.",
        "Q: Yeah. How many \u2014 how many more minutes do we have?\nQ2: Well, we\u2019ve only got two.",
        "Q: Then let\u2019s finish right here.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s finish right here and we\u2019ll continue more after lunch.\nQ2: As we were talking about the Finnish.",
        "Q: As we were talking about the Finnish yes. All right.\nEnd of Tape Two\nOctober 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14\", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, where\nwe left off, you were describing to us how you saw the downed Soviet plane which\nhad fought \u2014 which was flying against \u2014 in the Finnish \u2014 the Winter War against\nFinland, how it landed near Panev\u00e9zys, and you saw the dismantled parts of it being\ntaken by Soviet soldiers, and it aroused a great deal of curiosity amongst the \u2014 the\nkids in school, and you all went to the windows to take a look. I wanted to ask a\nquestion about, let\u2019s say, how kids felt then when these events were happening. And\nbring it back to the very beginning of tensions. Did you, as \u2014 as young students have\nan urge to do something, whether it was against the Germans, or against the Poles, or\nagainst the Soviets, to defend your country? Were there any such student types of\ndiscussions or ideas going on, or even actions that were taken?",
        "A: Well, I could tell about one really ridiculous thing, because we were 15 years old\nwhen the \u2014 there was a tension about Klaip\u00e9da, a problem, the Germans were\npressing Lithuania at that time, and it was clear that they will, sooner or later will\ndemand that Lithuania return Klaip\u00e9da, together with the Klaip\u00e9da territory to\nGermany. So my classmate, and my close friend, he told me that he heard a rumor\nthat there is no organization, but secretly Lithuanian army is mobilizing, taking the\nvolunteers, registering the volunteers, and he \u2014 he kind of suggested that we might\nOctober 14, 2010\nbe interested in that. So I\u2014I said yes. My father was fighting for Lithuania, now it\u2019s\nmy turn, y-you know. And we went together with him to \u2014",
        "Q: Did you tell your father?",
        "A: No, of course not. That would be the end of the story. No, we went together with\nhim to the military office in Panev\u00e9zys, and just asks whether, you know, they \u2014\nthey need any voluntaries to fight for Lithuania. Well, the sergeant there was kind\nof a \u2014 excited. I mean, he was \u2014 he was dumbfounded really, you know. And we\ncouldn\u2019t understand why \u2014 why he was you know, so kind of confused. We just\nwanted to fight for Lithuania, that\u2019s all, that seems so \u2014 and he, an elderly sergeant,\nyou know, was a pr \u2014 now I can see, you know, why \u2014 why he was \u2014 the children\nwant fight for Lithuania, well \u2014 but that was the end of the story. They said no,\nthank you, you know. If we need we will call on you, and we\u2019ll call nev \u2014\neverybody. But now \u2014 now, we don\u2019t need your service. But good \u2014 good boys, you\nknow, grow up. You will be good soldiers someday. Okay, so we went back to class,\nand somehow, apparently my friend told ma \u2014 our \u2014 our friend Rubinsteinas(ph), a\nJewish friend. He was one of our gang, Shalamas(ph) Rubinsteinas(ph), and he \u2014\napparently my friend told him about that story, and he was all upset that we didn\u2019t\ntake him with th \u2014 with \u2014 with us. He also wanted to fight Germans.",
        "Q: Wanted to fight.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, so that was the oh \u2014 the only really disagreement we had with him i-1n our\n\u20141n our friendship. So \u2014 so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the story. After that, of course, we were 1-\nin that organ \u2014 organization, Sauliai, I would call like national guard. And we took\nseriously our duties, you know, whenever we were called upon.",
        "Q: To check the girls\u2019 bags.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, well that\u2019s \u2014 I didn\u2019t do that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was supposed to be responsible for that guard, and I didn\u2019t check on \u2014 on it. But\nyeah, yeah, so on.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s like that.",
        "Q: But there was \u2014 was there any such talk \u2014 did it ever \u2014 first of all, did this story \u2014\nthis event ever reach your parents\u2019 ears?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t tell that.",
        "Q: Okay. And number two, did \u2014 did anything similar happen with \u2014 with Poles or\nwith lith \u2014 with the Soviets, or anything else that was developing at the time? Was\nthere any other talk amongst the kids in school of any sort of resistance or activity,\nor anything like that about things \u2014 these histor \u2014 these [indecipherable]\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, n-nothing against the Poles. I mean, the thing went too f\u2014 too fast. We didn\u2019t\n\u2014 we didn\u2019t even realize what the ultimatum was ac-accepted, you know. And I was\nsick at that time at home, you know, so I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how my friends reacted, and\n\u2014at school. But no, this thing became only when the Soviets occupied Lithuania,\nthen \u2014 then we found tha-that we have to resist that somehow. And that\u2019s another\npart of my story, you know, when a \u2014 when the Soviets annex Lithuania, occupied\nand annexed Lithuania. Yeah, I was looking for a place, you know, I could join\nsome resistance group. And the only group I knew was the Catholic organization,\nadate \u2014",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: Adaytis(ph)",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Adaytis(ph), and this organization was illegal under the independent Lithuania,\nSmetona\u2019s regime, because they \u2014 it was legal in the universities, but not 1n the \u2014 in\nthe high schools, because Smetona\u2019s regime thought that it\u2019s too early to get into\npolitical things.

        "Q: Excuse us, please, can we stop the tape, please? [tape break] I want to come to\nthat \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 but we\u2019re getting a little ahead of ourselves chronologically.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back to October, when the bases appear, yo-you hear the news, the\nMolotov-Ribbentrop pact, the bases appear, the plane is down, you see the \u2014 the\nparts going on. How did life change after that? How di \u2014 did it \u2014 did you feel it\nimpact you in any way when those bases first arrived?",
        "A: No, the things quieted down. While the Soviets were fighting against the Finns,\nthey didn\u2019t put any pressure on Lithuania. The bases were there, you know, but\nthere were no conflicts as far as we were conc \u2014 you know, aware. And it seemed\nlike, you know, we were a gr \u2014 very upset and apprehensive 1-1n the fall, about\nOctober, November. But in the springtime of 1940, it looked like the things quieted\ndown.",
        "Q: Life hadn\u2019t changed much.",
        "A: The life, they didn\u2019t change much. Of course, war was going on, as I said, you\nknow, and there were \u2014 there were less selection in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the m \u2014\non the market because of the blockades, you know. But life was going pretty normal\nby that time.",
        "Q: So th \u2014 the government \u2014 what had happened to Mr. Smetona, President\nSmetona? Did he stay around? Was he still president?",
        "A: Yes, he was still president. Government was fank \u2014 functioning as it always did.\nIt seemed like the things quieted down. Of course, we were following war. The\nOctober 14, 2010\nGermans were landing in Scandinavia, in Denmark, and Norway, and then, you\nknow, they attacked in the west, a-and \u2014 through Netherlands, Belgium and\nFrance, and the big battles of 1940 was going in the west. So everybody was\nfollowing what\u2019s going on, because it was \u2014",
        "Q: Was this through Lithuanian radio, or \u2014 or newspapers, or was this also\ninternation \u2014 did you get any kind of international broadcasts?",
        "A: At that time Lithuanian b \u2014 was sufficient. We got from Lithuanian newspapers,\nLithuanian radio the information. Of course, other s \u2014 radio stations, German,\nRussian and others were available, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel like we have to use\nthat at that time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Okay. And what would be the next \u2014 you were then what year of high\nschool? In June \u2014 in April of \u201940?",
        "A: It was a six \u2014 sixth year, I-I was yeah, finishing the sixth class, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. And what would be the next major event that you recall from that spring,\nor, you know, as the months went on?",
        "A: Well, the occupation. Because \u2014",
        "Q: What does the occupation mean in this ken \u2014 in this sense? You have bases, but\nhow does that change to occupation?",
        "A: Oh yeah, the bases were limited 1n certain places, and they were closed, they\ndidn\u2019t let their soldiers roam around, you know, they were all in \u2014 in the bases. And\nOctober 14, 2010\nsuddenly, you know, the Soviet army \u2014 well, as a \u2014 as I told, I mean, I \u2014 my father\ncame \u2014 we knew that our government delegation is in Moscow, there are some kind\nof problems there, but nobody thought it\u2019s a great deal. And then suddenly my father\ncame from somewhere, called me, and said, you know that the Soviets are occupying\nthe country, taking over the country. And that\u2019s what happened, and that \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember that conversation?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Where were you at the time?",
        "A: At home. At home.",
        "Q: And how did he look when he told you this?",
        "A: It was already vacation started, you know, and then it was June, and vacation\nstarted, classes were over. And my father were all upset, and excited, and I had my\nfriend with me. And he said, let \u2014 let the friend go. So I said, oh, my \u2014 my father has\nsomething to \u2014",
        "Q: Who was this friend?",
        "A: \u2014 for me to do. Well, it was a younger boy from the high school, and \u2014 but two\nclasses lower, because he was younger. He was just \u2014 just as a \u2014 his relationship was\nstrange. He was related to the Polish Marshall Pilsudski, who was \u2014 died \u2014 who died\nby \u2014 by that time he was dead. But he was related through his \u2014 his mother side, you\nknow. And I don\u2019t know whether he considered himself Pole or Lithuanian, but he\nOctober 14, 2010\nwas also very much interested in politics, in wa \u2014 in th-the war going on here. We\ncame, we discussed those things. I was kind of try to be diplomatic, you know, I\ndidn\u2019t show my an \u2014 our hostility \u2014",
        "Q: Anti [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 to the Polish, you know, and I tried to be diplomatic, and then my father came\nand said let \u2014 let him go, and then I said, my father has something to do, has a task.\nAnd then my father said, you know, the Soviets are occupying Lithuania. And that\nwas in the afternoon. Night, we slept during the night. During the night the Soviet\ntroops came from Vilnius, it took Vilnius first and went to Panev\u00e9zys, and started \u2014\nwell, then the tanks, th-the \u2014 the motorized troops, you know, were going \u2014 it \u2014 it\nwas not a \u2014 a garrison, it was not a base. It wa \u2014 they were all over the place. And a \u2014\ntaking over, you know, and taking over the military establishments in Lithuania,\ntaking hi \u2014 the barracks, the \u2014",
        "Q: How did it look in Panev\u00e9zys? What were the \u2014 what did you see from that time,\nthe next morning?",
        "A: Well, the next morning we came up, they were already went through Panev\u00e9zys,\nthey were in the ba \u2014 in the military barracks somewhere, and they went farther from\nPanev\u00e9zys over Ciulai. We still saw some tanks, some military cars going, you\nknow, on the road, but not ma \u2014 the mass, which was before, you know, during the\nnight.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see that \u2014 that massive movement, it was during the night, and somehow I\ndidn\u2019t hear it, and \u2014 although there should have been some \u2014 some noi \u2014 a lot of\nnoise, but somehow I slept well. And that\u2019s it. And wi \u2014",
        "Q: Was your house in the middle of town, was it on the outskirts?",
        "A: A-All \u2014 all over, in the outskirts, because \u2014",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking your place, where you lived, where you \u2014",
        "A: Oh, in the \u2014 in the middle of the town, really.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We had our house quite near the center, right near my high school. And \u2014 well,\nit\u2019s difficult to say, but you know, there were also reports in the radio, in the press\nthat the president has left Lithuania, he fled Lithuania, so he was condemned that\nhe didn\u2019t stay with his country during the critical time, and all that kind of thing, and\nthis \u2014",
        "Q: Was this \u2014 was this still the Lithuanian press, or was this already \u2014",
        "A: Still the Lithuanian press, 1t seemed like Lithuanian press, but apparently the\ncontrol was already in \u2014 1n the Soviet hands, or at least in the communist \u2014\nLithuanian communist party\u2019s hands.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 and \u2014 and then, you know, that same day, it was Sunday. Saturday\nthere was the ultimatum and they marched into Lithuania and in Panev\u00e9zys Sunday\nafternoon, I saw the first communist demonstration in Panev\u00e9zys in the main square.\nThe people didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t walk the streets. It was Sunday and the city was kind of\nempty. I went to s \u2014 into this \u2014 the city to take a look at what\u2019s going on. Nothing.\nWere \u2014 were very few people going dur \u2014 during the streets, in the streets. Not like a\nregular Sunday. And then I went to the main square and there was a demonstration,\nnot a big one, maybe 50 - 60 people there.",
        "Q: Young, old?",
        "A: Mostly young, I would say, mostly young people. And they were \u2014 had the red\nflag there, and they were speaking in Lithuanian, you know, against the sovi \u2014\nSmetona government, against the \u2014 the whole system, against the fascist\ngovernment, as they called here \u2014 Smetona\u2019s government. And the others were\nlistening to that, and j-just seemed like all of them \u2014 of the people were Jewish.",
        "Q: How did \u2014 how did you know? I mean, how did it seem \u2014 why would \u2014 why\nwould you make that assumption? How did you \u2014 yeah, how could you tell?",
        "A: Well, typically from \u2014 from the racial features, and from the accent the speakers\nused. The listeners, of course, I don\u2019t know. Well, I didn't check all, I was kind of\naside, you know, I wasn\u2019t in the demonstration itself. So it\u2019s difficult to say, you\nknow, the composition, but it \u2014 the impression was like most of them or even all of\nOctober 14, 2010\nthem were Jewish. Now, my fa \u2014 the Jew \u2014 the communist party was illegal in\nLithuania before that. Even when the \u2014 when the bases came in, it still was illegal.\nMy father was working in the court system, and some of the \u2014 of the clients, as he\ncalled, he had some communists also, who were accused just of the communist\nactivities. And so he was concerned that now, you know, that things changed, and\nthose communists will became very influential. And \u2014",
        "Q: What did he say \u2014 what did he tend to say about those communists that were his\nclients, earlier? Did he have opinions about them?",
        "A: Yeah, he had a negative opinion, because one of the \u2014 of the important\ncommunists which he was exim \u2014 examining his activities, was from a very rich\nJewish family in Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember their name?",
        "A: From very rich \u2014 pardon?",
        "Q: Do you remember their name?",
        "A: No, I wouldn't, but I\u2014 I could find, because he was important later on, so maybe I\ncould find out later, but I don\u2019t remember exact now. And so 1-1\u2014 even that, you\nknow, for him looked kind of ridiculous or \u2014 or \u2014 or unacceptable that from such a\nrich family, you know, he becomes communist, and is working against the\nLithuanian government, really. And I must say, later he was concerned that he will\nOctober 14, 2010\nbecome imp \u2014 1m \u2014 important person, which was right, he became very important\nperson. But became not in Panev\u00e9zys, but in Vilnius.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I ent \u2014 the \u2014 the story is interesting. He was afraid that there will be some\nrevenge. There was nothing from that. He didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Who was \u2014 who was afraid there would be revenge?",
        "A: My father.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: My father was afraid that they \u2014 he will re \u2014 take revenge against him because he\nwas conducting that investigation. But there was none.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was \u2014 he was in Vilnius, he was doing his \u2014 communists were there, you\nknow, and whatever, and there was none. But there were some other people, you\nknow, who take revenge, mostly criminals.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Who also thought, I mean, they might be \u2014 so, th-they had the problem there, but\nthis communist wasn\u2019t \u2014 he just ignored.",
        "Q: So when you s \u2014 okay, when you saw this demonstration, what \u2014 do you\nremember what your feelings were at the time?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: I was afraid. I was afraid that the revolution is going on, from what I heard what\nhappened in Russia, you know, with all the cruelties of the revolution might happen\nright \u2014 right here, right now, you know, in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys. They decided \u2014 they\ndecided that they sh \u2014 you know, they should go and disperse the police, this \u2014 the\nfash \u2014 fascist police, as they said. And they \u2014 they march with their red flag, they\nmarch toward police, I didn\u2019t follow them, and I f\u2014 later find out that the Lithuanian\nmilitary officer in Panev\u00e9zys telephoned the Soviet forces, whichever the\ncommander was in Panev\u00e9zys, and asks whether, you know, that\u2019s supposed what\u2019s\n\u2014 what should happen, because they were trying to \u2014 to disperse the police, you\nknow, and take the police headquarters in Panev\u00e9zys. And the Soviet commander\nsaid no, no demonstrations, nothing is allowed, and if you don\u2019t \u2014 if you don\u2019t\nprotect the quiet in \u2014 in the city, we will have to take care of it and provide this \u2014 this\n\u2014 so th-there would be no d \u2014 no demonstrations, nothing. So then, you know, h-he\nco \u2014 the c \u2014 the commandant, the Lithuanian officer called Sauliai, and we were also\ncalled, I \u2014 oh, we went to the Sauliai headquarters, we have given rifles, and we\nwere supposed \u2014 there was \u2014 commandant\u2019s hour, was supposed to enforce that, to\npatrol the streets, and see that nobody walks during the nighttime, which we \u2014",
        "Q: And you did that?",
        "A: Which we did, yeah. I did, and my friends did. That was quite \u2014 nobody was\ndemonstrating nothing, nobody was walking around.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Did you, first of all, did you recognize anybody? Within that demonstration was\nthere anybody you personally knew or recognized?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "Q: And did you know of Lithuanian communists? Not Jewish communists, but\nLithuanian communists, who either would be there, or who had been in somehow or\nother known, or active?",
        "A: No, not \u2014 not real communists. There were people, very leftists, you know,\nopinions, one \u2014 one \u2014 one \u2014 one doctor, he was a friend of the family. He was \u2014 he\nwas very leftist, but he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he was very favorable about the Soviet Union. He \u2014\nhe had very favorable opinion, but he wasn\u2019t communist, he wasn\u2019t working for the\nparty or anything like that, so.",
        "Q: Did anything \u2014 do you know what happened to him when this \u2014 there was the fo \u2014\nthe Soviet occupation? Did his [indecipherable] change?",
        "A: He became director of the \u2014 of the hospital.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then I think he expanded that hospital very well. He \u2014 he would \u2014 as \u2014 as a\ndoctor he was really, you know, valued under the system. But I \u2014 I su \u2014 suspect mo-\nmore than a doctor than \u2014 than a co \u2014 I don\u2019t think he was really a communist, even\nOctober 14, 2010\nafter \u2014 in particular after he saw, you know, the communism in \u2014 you know, in \u2014 in\nreal life.",
        "Q: I want to go back again to that demonstration. You said you were scared. Did you\nhave any view of \u2014 did you have any \u2014 any thoughts about the demonstrators? You\nknow, why they were demonstrating? Were you surprised to see it? Were you \u2014",
        "A: I was surprised, but I understood that there \u2014 there are communists, so we \u2014 we\nknew my father said that there [indecipherable] are the young, some young Jewish\npeople, the communists wi \u2014 1s popular between some young Jewish peop \u2014 men and\n\u2014 and la \u2014 and girls. So it wasn\u2019t really much of surprise. Still, 1t was a very small, I\nmean, there were thousands of Jews in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zZys. This \u2014 this group was small\ngroup, and apparently that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the limit at that time.",
        "Q: Okay, so you dispersed, and it went away, and it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something that\nstayed.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know exactly, I didn\u2019t follow them, and I went home, and then I got\nthe call, that Sauliai are called for duty. But what happened in between, except that\nthing the \u2014 our military, Lithuanian military officer telephoning the Soviets, that \u2014 I\nwas told about that, but I don\u2019t know exactly how it went, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, so now it\u2019s occupied, there is no more Lithuanian government, the\npresident has left. What else happened, what else changed?",
        "A: Well, demonstrations.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: More of them?",
        "A: Oh yeah, well \u2014 but those were officials, you know. The people had to go into\ndemonstrations. From their working places they were told that they better go, you\nknow, and there was a threat, unconcealed threat that si \u2014 they will take care of all\nthose who are against the people\u2019s government, as they say. And \u2014",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 I mean, from your story I get a sense that there was this \u2014 that\nthere was a benign feeling for most of the independence years about the Soviet\nUnion.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That when there was the Finno-Russian war, then you were on the side of the\nFinns because you know, they were the weaker, or the \u2014 1t was their territory that\nwas being attacked, and so it was more that you were on their side than the Soviet\nside. But when did it stop being a benign feeling? When did it start being a\nthreatening feeling? One where you\u2019re \u2014 where you\u2019re saying, these are our\nenemies? When did that \u2014 when did that change [indecipherable]",
        "A: Beginning was the first \u2014 the intr \u2014 1-introduction of the military bases, that \u2014 that\nwas the first, and then the thing, you get \u2014 you get deeper. But that \u2014 that was the\nfirst.",
        "Q: Okay, so that\u2019s October, 1939.",
        "A: Yeah.\n100October 14, 2010",
        "Q: And then in June 1940 there\u2019s a full occupation.",
        "A: Right. But even then, before that, go \u2014 with the World War going on, in particular\nw-with France collapsing, many people were thinking that Lithuania might not be\nable to survive as independent country. And there was a discussion going on, which\nis better, that the Germans would take over or the \u2014 or the Russians? Because Po-\nPoland wa-was gone, you know, was conquered by the \u2014 by both of them and\npartitioned. And I would say \u2014 I was inclined that it ba \u2014 may be better under the\nGermans, my opinion. Not very strong, but I was leaning that way. But th \u2014 I would\nsay the majority of Lithuanians we knew in \u2014 in the circle, were of the opinion that\nmaybe the Russians occupation would be more benign, because the Russians are not\nthat efficient, not that organized in our opinion.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And \u2014 and Lithuanian nation would have a better chance to survive longer \u2014 long\ntime than under harsh and efficient German occupation. So even at that point, people\nwere leaning more toward the Russians than the Germans, more toward the Soviets.\nWell, the Russians they were call \u2014 calling at that time, until the occupation itself.",
        "Q: And why were you, you know, slightly more inclined toward \u2014 if \u2014 of \u2014 of the\ntwo evils, the German one would be the lesser?",
        "A: That\u2019s difficult to say f-for me, I don\u2019t know. Maybe from the times of Taurag\u00e9,\ntheir culture were more familiar to me. And you know, we had very good German\nOctober 14, 2010\nteacher, even a g \u2014 a German, Lithuanian German in Panev\u00e9zys, and German\nculture, maybe made impression on me. I \u2014 I \u2014 I like \u2014 I read \u2014 I\u2014 I knew German\nlanguage fairly well. I started reading German books. Th \u2014 just that. It wasn\u2019t\nsomething very \u2014 very firm, you know, but I would say I was leaning that way.",
        "Q: Okay. So it \u2014",
        "A: And the communist system somehow looked inefficient, distasteful. Thi \u2014 thi \u2014 I\n\u2014I didn\u2019t realize the amount of \u2014 of violence in the nationa \u2014 national soc \u2014\nsocialistic German [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t re-realize that much, than what I f\u2014\nlater found out. And the Soviets were pretty obvious. Once they came in, they were\nobvious. They wer \u2014 they we \u2014 they were threatening. They were not \u2014 not \u2014\npropaganda was before they came in.",
        "Q: The pro \u2014 there was, or there was not propaganda?",
        "A: There was a lot of propaganda but they didn\u2019t care whether we believed or not \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 because the main thing was the threat behind it.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So when they actually occupied \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 then that changed? Then they cared that you believed it?",
        "A: Oh, they cared all the time, but I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you know, e-even being friendly\nto them didn\u2019t mean much, you know? Some ca \u2014 somehow \u2014\n102October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Show me \u2014 explain to me how this threat made itself felt. Even \u2014 you know, you\nhave a\u2014 up to th \u2014I have a picture of Soviets in the streets, Russian soldiers in the\nstreets, this demonstration, an ideology that\u2019s against the \u2014 the former independent\ngovernment and so on. But what makes this scary? What makes this aggressive?",
        "A: Well, they started arresting people pretty soon, you know, I don\u2019t know, ma \u2014\nmaybe not the first week, but the second or third week, some of Lithuania\u2019s\nministers from the previous government were arrested and brou \u2014 and not arrested in\nLithuania, but arrested and brought to the Soviet Union. And then, just in about a\nmonth time, you know, the \u2014 a lot of people get arrested, including my director of\nour high school.",
        "Q: The one who said that Germany would lose the war?",
        "A: Right. Yeah, he was arrested, I \u2014- a\u2014 a\u2014a good man, you know, we knew, and a\nlot of other people who were considered, you know, like leading in this society,\nhaving influence in the society. There were thousands arrested. And the thing, you\nknow, the \u2014 there was a prison in Panev\u00e9zys in the center of the city, built by the\ntsars, not far from the \u2014 our house. Our house was in the neighborhood of \u2014 of that\nprison. And right there, you know, the prison was \u2014 had bars in \u2014 in the windows.\nNow the bars stayed, but once the Russians came in, you know, they put like some\nboxes over the windows, so th-they couldn\u2019t see. Maybe they could see from the \u2014\none \u2014 from the top, the \u2014 the sun, some \u2014 some light, but they couldn\u2019t see anything\n103October 14, 2010\noutside. You know, even tho-those small things, you know, this \u2014 that \u2014 the prison\nnot good enough, they \u2014 they had to make it much \u2014 much worse, you know, to\nisolate people they couldn\u2019t see outside. Yeah, and pretty soon even the \u2014 from our \u2014\nfrom our gymnasium, from our \u2014 not from our class, but you know, they were\narrested, even \u2014 even the students.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yeah, one of them was active in that Daiteninkai(ph), that Christian Catholic\norganization, before \u2014 apparently therefore, he was arrested. Well, the resistance\nmovement started already, so that might be the things they \u2014 and they were not very\npar-particular to get exactly their man, you know. And 1f-if they wanted to get their\nman, you know, and they didn\u2019t know who it is, so they took 10 of them, thinking\n104October 14, 2010\nthat most likely one of them will be the \u2014 they are looking for. And that\u2019s it, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat was \u2014 pretty soon we found that that mattered, you know. The terror started\npretty soon. Not the first days, but pretty soon. And of course, everything changed.\nMy father lost his job. A lot of people were changed in \u2014 1n governing positions, 1n \u2014\neven in technical positions. So \u2014 but no-not only that, but a lot of people were losing\ntheir jobs and \u2014 in the government, and in administration. And everything that, you\nknow, made very oppressive [inaudible]",
        "Q: Did you hear of any \u2014 any murders? Did you hear of any \u2014",
        "A: At that time not yet.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. Did anybody come home from those prisons, and so \u2014",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So no \u2014 people were arrested, but they didn\u2019t come back from being arrested?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay. And that happens all in June, July, 1940?",
        "A: July.",
        "Q: July.",
        "A: July. June was just a half a month ba \u2014 two weeks left. June 15\" they took a \u2014\nmarched into Lithuania, 16\", so July. But fr \u2014 right from very beginning of July.",
        "Q: So, what was the summer of 1940 like for you?\n105October 14, 2010",
        "A: Summer was easy because we went to the \u2014 on the vacation. Well, I \u2014 first of all,\nafter this incident in \u2014 in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9Zzys, when we had to enforce the commandant\u2019s\nhour, it was vacation time, as far as the school is concerned. So I went to my\nmother\u2019s farm, which was where she was come from, and her sister was there, you\nknow, running the farm with her husband. And so I went there, and I went there\nbecause I thought \u2014 I mean, this \u2014 this territory might be taken over by the Germans.\nThere were rumors you know, that \u2014",
        "Q: And you preferred to still, you know \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, since I preferred to stay wi-with the Germans, you know, I-I thought\nmaybe \u2014 now I found out th-that not \u2014 there was a division. The Germans were\ntaking \u2014 supposed to take over part of Lithuania there. But nobody knew exactly,\nyou know, where the \u2014 the dividing line would be. But eventually they didn\u2019t. The\nRussians took over the \u2014 the entire country. So, then they went back home and we\nwent on our regular vacation with our \u2014 my uncle in the \u2014 in the eastern Lithuania\nin that \u2014",
        "Q: The one with the nice farm with the lakes and things like that?",
        "A: With the lakes, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\n106October 14, 2010",
        "A: And wi-wi \u2014 and with \u2014 with the boat in the lake and all that. And it was a really\nquiet place. There was not much going. We heard on the radio, we read 1n the\nnewspapers all the changes going on in the country.",
        "Q: And this is by the \u2014 by this point Soviet press, Soviet Lithuanian press?",
        "A: Y-Yes, it all \u2014 officially some of them that still had old names, but obviously they\nwere run already by different people appointed by the new government. So it was a\nquite \u2014 we were \u2014 you know, we were disturbed what \u2014 about what it was happening,\nbut at that particular place, nothing much was happening. And people were all\nconcerned, everybody was tense. There was supposed to be elections to the people\u2019s\nparliament, where you know, there were exactly that many candidates as had to be\nelected deputies. People boy \u2014 boycotted th-that, or even if they voted, they drew,\nyou know, the cartoon characters instead of the bulletins inside. But that was about\nit, there \u2014 there was not much, and the meantime they annexed Lithuania. This \u2014\nthis parliament was called into the session and accepted the request\n[indecipherable] Lithuania would be included in the Soviet Union. And we were\nworking with my father in the forest, and came out of the forest into the small town,\nand we saw that there were some red flags out, and we asked \u2014 I mean, what\u2019s \u2014\nwhat\u2019s now? I mean, what\u2019s new? And there was a \u2014 a smith working at the edge of\nthe town, and we ask him, what \u2014 what\u2019s now, I mean, why \u2014 why the red flags here?\nSaid, well, they annexed \u2014 they annexed Moscow to Lithuania. So that was that,\n107October 14, 2010\nbecause they annexed \u2014 announced the annexation. So that was very upsetting, but in\nthat village not much was happening, until, you know, my vacation was over, I came\nback to Panev\u00e9zys, and Panev\u00e9zys there were changes, there were cha \u2014",
        "Q: What kind of changes did you see?",
        "A: Well, even the Soviet placards ne \u2014 red, you know, flags everywhere, you know,\n[indecipherable]. Pretty soon my father was fired from his job, had to look for \u2014 for\ns \u2014 for some other job, finally found in a bank, as a clerk in a bank. Those \u2014 those\nthings, let\u2019s see, when \u2014 when did military took over? Part of our \u2014 yeah, I think at\nthat time, yeah, they \u2014 they were [indecipherable]. We were supposed to have that\nmuch living space, we had much more in our own house, so they took the rest of it,\nand put the s \u2014 the Soviet officers into our house.",
        "Q: So the German \u2014 the \u2014 the refugee from Klaip\u00e9da no longer was there in the\n[indecipherable]",

        "A: \u2014 she moved out somewhere, yeah. And so they put \u2014 they put the Soviet officers\nthere, and they \u2014 they changed. For awhile one family was there, then another, and\nfinally there was a Soviet Air Force officer, and his wife was a Soviet army medicine\ndoctor.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\n108October 14, 2010",
        "A: So th \u2014 and they had the small, small girl, and they stayed for quite awhile in our\n\u2014 in our house. And then another part of the house was taken over and one of the\ncommunist leaders, Lithuanian communist leaders were put in that part of the \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know who this person was before he took over that part of the house?",
        "A: We knew about him, but we didn\u2019t know him personally.",
        "Q: Okay. And how did that Soviet officer and his wife, or any of them behave? Did\nyou \u2014 did \u2014 were they \u2014",
        "A: O-Oh th \u2014 oh, the officer himself, you know, th-the air force officer was a\nUkrainian. Very reserved, very reserved, very quiet. His wife was completely\ndifferent, very talkative, very expressive, liked to discuss things with \u2014 with \u2014 here in\nwith me with my poor Russian, which she corrected all the time. And, was very\nfriendly lady, very friendly lady yeah. And th-the \u2014 and the girl, you know, the small\ngirl, they \u2014 they \u2014 1t was difficult. He was in \u2014 in the d\u2014 on the duty, she was on the\nduty sometimes. So they brought a g \u2014 a girl from Ukraine, a young girl maybe 15 -\n16 \u2014 16 - 17 years old maybe, Ukrainian girl, to take care of their small do \u2014 small \u2014\nsmall daughter. And that was strange for us, because that said, you know, y \u2014 y-you\ncannot live like this \u2014 this \u2014 I mean, you can\u2019t live like this, you have \u2014 you will go\nto Siberia, you have to prepare for that.",
        "Q: They said this? Who said this?\n109\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: This girl, Ukrainian girl. N-Not the officer\u2019s wife, no, that \u2014 this girl which was\nbrought to take care of their ch \u2014 their child, said, well \u2014 why \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 we\ndid \u2014 we didn\u2019t intend to go to Siberia or anywhere else, you know, why \u2014 why\nshould we?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it was like [indecipherable]. Then she started talking about Ukrainian f-\nfamine. Now, my father said, well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 nobo \u2014 nobody heard about that,\nyou know, and sh-sh-she might be a little bit, you know, she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s \u2014 you know,\nliving in fantasies, you know, so we \u2014 we just \u2014 we just discounted that, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You ignored what she was saying.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 1t was obvious nonsense, you know, so who c \u2014 who \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. And that happened in the fall of 1940? Sometime in the \u2014",
        "A: Yes, 1940, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. How did the very \u2014 did you know anything of what was going on in the\nJewish community in Panev\u00e9zys, and what kind of discussions, how they were\naffected by the Soviet occupation, by this incorporation, what the sentiments there\nwere? Did you have any contact with your friend who had wanted to go help fight\nthe Germans with you? Did you \u2014 di \u2014 yeah, can you tell a little bit about what you\ndid or did not know?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Not much. First of all, was completely obvious and natural that the Jewish\ncommunity was glad that Lith-Lithuania was not occupied by the Germans, and if it\nhad to go down, you know, it\u2019s better that the Russians took over. With that, many\nLithuanians would have agreed. But now, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we noticed\npretty soon the hostility against independent Lithuania, against the previous, not\nonly government, but the country itself. Now, it\u2019s very difficult to say how prev \u2014\nprev \u2014 prevalent this \u2014 this attitude was. There was definitely some, in particular in\nthe younger generation there. For us Lithuanians, was a gr-great surprise. We never\nthought that our relations are bad, we never thought that the Jewish people are\nsomehow disadvantaged in Lithuania or \u2014 or discriminated against. Yet, the\ncommunity was kind of separate, jewi \u2014 but we were \u2014 we were thinking and wer-\nwere convinced that that was the choice of the Jewish community. They wanted to\nhave their own schools, they wanted to have, of course, their religions and\nsynagogues and all that kind of thing, and their organizations. And we didn't mind,\nbut a lot of their life was separate from Lithuanian. There were some Jews which\nwere integrated into Lithuanian society, but there were very few of them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There were some \u2014 some doctors, s \u2014 in particular in \u2014 in professions. And now,\nyou see, I \u2014 since the Soviet terror became obvious quite soon, it 1s very difficult to\nsay. Those who were for the Soviet system became very loud. And they wanted to\nOctober 14, 2010\nmake, you know, career, to make a do \u2014 to \u2014 to advance in this new s \u2014 new society.\nSo they were a \u2014 loud, they were active, they were running around. They were\ntearing off the Lithuanian symbols, you know, from \u2014 from the houses or wherever\nthey were \u2014 they were. Those who were against them whether Lithuanian or Jewish\nor whatever, were kind of subdued. Because the terror was there, there was no sense\nstarting, you know, frankly, resisting that, or \u2014",
        "Q: Openly resisting it.",
        "A: Openly, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So those who were against that were quiet and tried to be, you know, not \u2014 not\nobvious, you know, with \u2014 with \u2014",
        "Q: Not noticeably \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 their opinions there, so you know. So it\u2019s this \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to\nsay how much of Jewish communi \u2014 community were collaborating with the Sov \u2014\nSoviet occupation. But it \u2014 it was obvious that they were, because knew \u2014 officers\nknew \u2014 knew people with responsibility there, a lot of them were Jewish. Not all of\nthem, some of them were Lithuanian communists, but there were not that many\nLithuanian communists. All Lithuanian communists got good and significant\npositions at that time, tasks to do, but there weren't that many of them. And once\nthey ran out of them, also the Jewish people came in and there were \u2014 there were\nOctober 14, 2010\nmore of them, I-lot \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t know percentage-wise \u2014 in numbers wouldn\u2019t be\nmore, but percentage-wise definitely there were more Jewish collaborators than\nLithuanian collaborators with the Soviet government. There were also Russians. The\nRussians also was a split community because part of them were glad that, you know,\nthe Russians were taking over the country. Even the tsarist refugees from the tsarist\ngov \u2014 from the Soviet government, who fled to Lithuania said well, it\u2019s \u2014 th-they\nmight destroy us, you know, the Russians, who were against this \u2014 the Soviets, but\nit\u2019s still nice that the Russia is expanding again.",
        "Q: Did you have someone say that to you, or did you \u2014",
        "A: Not a ma \u2014 to \u2014 1-1-1s \u2014 as somebody told to my father that, exactly.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A\u2014a Russian he knew, you know, friendly. So \u2014 and so some of them\ncollaborated, but some of them, of course, also tried to just disappear from the view,\nso not to attract any attention, so that they wouldn\u2019t be, you know, repressed like\n[indecipherable] or the \u2014 of the government.",
        "Q: So in this \u2014 in this situation, it sounds like there\u2019s growing fear, growing terror.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And also a sense of being betrayed.",
        "A: Right, right.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: But by whom? And \u2014 and it \u2014 as far as you could tell at the time, ou \u2014 that feeling\nof betrayal, where was it deepest? Where did it sen \u2014 seem to be deepest?",
        "A: Against the Jewish community.",
        "Q: Against the Jewish community.",
        "A: Against the Jewish community.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: Although we were aware \u2014 we were aware that some of them really are against\nthe s \u2014",
        "Q: The Soviet system.",
        "A: \u2014 Soviet system. But how many \u2014 how influential were \u2014 it was difficult for us to\nsay. Now, my classmate, Rubeinsteinas(ph) \u2014 our high school or gymnasium was\nsplit in two. And \u2014",
        "Q: By this time you\u2019re 17 years old.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he \u2014 he went to another gy-gymnasium, so my contact didn\u2019t disappear, but\nwa-wasn\u2019t that every day contact that we had when we had the same \u2014 were in the\nsame class. A-And instead we came wa-wa-wa \u2014 came the girls from the girls\u2019\nschool, we were mixed up now, before they were separate. And yeah, we got f\u2014 aj \u2014\na Jewish girl come in, there were many more \u2014 n-not many, but more, but I think \u2014\n114October 14, 2010\nbut I remember one of them, and the \u2014 it was obvious that this \u2014 this girl had nothing\nto do with the communist system or whatever, like that. She was very quiet, very\nnice girl, very good student. I really admired it \u2014 re \u2014 her. I \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: U-Uditta(ph) Gormanita(ph).",
        "Q: Uditta(ph) Gormanita(ph).",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And her \u2014 her father was a \u2014 a rich merchant in smaller city, not in Panev\u00e9Zys,\nbut not far from Panev\u00e9zys, Ramigala, and her uncle was in London, also a rich\nman \u2014 arich merchant there. And I don\u2019t know, well luckily \u2014 so we \u2014 Uditta(ph)\nwas a wonderful girl, was a wonderful girl, we were dancing with her. I don\u2019t know,\nI didn\u2019t fell in love with her, but I admired her, definitely.",
        "Q: You liked her?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you know what happened to her? What her fate was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I s \u2014 I suppose just like other Jews were all \u2014 were rounded up\nand killed. I \u2014 although even my friends even now, when I talk with my c-class\nOctober 14, 2010\nfriends, cannot accept that fact, somehow say, well, maybe she s-somehow survived,\nbut there is no chance. There was no chance. He was terrif \u2014 she was terrified when\nthe war started, when the Germans attacked, and the Soviets. She was \u2014 we \u2014 I \u2014\nthat\u2019s the last time I met her, and a group of us met her, you know, she was terrified,\nshe \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me about that. Do you reme \u2014 if you remember it, tell me about that last time\nyou met her and what \u2014 what was the circumstance at that point?",
        "A: Well, we were g \u2014 two or three of us, three of us, I think were \u2014 were running\nthrough Panev\u00e9zys, war already started, the Germans were bombing.",
        "Q: You mean the war in Lithuania started \u2014",
        "A: Y-Yes.",
        "Q: Y-Y-Yes.",
        "A: [indecipherable] war in Lithuania, yeah, the ger \u2014 the Germans attacked\nSoviets, and we were looking for weapons, we wanted to fight Soviets.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We \u2014 we wanted to \u2014 since Lithuania didn\u2019t resist when it was occupied, we felt\nthat we just have a \u2014 Lithuania has a duty to, you know, to fight, to show that it\ndidn\u2019t accept that occupation, that we really want to be free, and really w \u2014 we were\nlooking for weapons, and didn\u2019t know where \u2014 where to find them. Previous\narrangements were broken down, you know, and so we were going there, and the j \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010\nwe just saw Uditta(ph) standing at the corner there, the ge \u2014 a German plane was\nturning circles around \u2014 around Panev\u00e9zys. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And she was at the corner of the center of the town?",
        "A: Right, right. Pretty high up, you know, the plane was there, the Russian officers\nwere shooting from their pistols, and that \u2014 1t was much too high to reach in the\nplane. And Uditta(ph) was also looking at that plane with terrified eyes. And we\nsaid, Uditta(ph), why are you afraid, I mean, you \u2014 you \u2014 you did nothing, you \u2014 you\nwere definitely \u2014 we didn\u2019t even conceive that the Germans would \u2014 what they did.\nWe couldn\u2019t conceive, we thought, I mean, it\u2019s a \u2014 it was a civilized nation, you\nknow, a nation of the western civilization. We \u2014 we didn\u2019t conceive that they \u2014\nsomething like that, that they would do, start killing the people all, you know,\nwithout any discrimination, nothing. We thought, I mean \u2014 well, those who worked\nfor the communists, those, you know, Jewish or not Jewish or Lithuanian or\nwhatever, they are in trouble definitely, but Jew \u2014 Uditta(ph), you know, that wa \u2014\nwho \u2014 who could choose her, you know?",
        "Q: Did she say anything when you said that?",
        "A: Nothing. We \u2014 we tried to tell her, you know, that there is no reason to be afraid,\nbut sh-she just listened and we saw that she \u2014 she just doesn\u2019t believe us, and she\nwas right. She was right. Yeah, I \u2014 I remember her, you know, I-I \u2014 I put \u2014 when \u2014\n117\nOctober 14, 2010\nwhen they were building this Holocaust Museum, you know, I \u2014 I asked, you know,\nthat her name would be inscribed in here.",
        "Q: Yeah. She made that kind of an impact on you.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. I go back and I keep wanting \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, I have the same question that I keep asking, which is, and what\nhappened then, and what happened then? So, if we can go back a little bit to when it\n\u2014 you know, before you talk about this incident with Uditta(ph), your \u2014 the betrayal\nthat I mentioned, that I brought up as a possibility before, as to who was betrayed a\nfeeling of betrayal, did you ever feel that that last independent Lithuanian\ngovernment also betrayed you by not resisting, by not fighting?",
        "A: Yes, in a sense yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Ina sense, yes, yeah. Although that was just symbolic, of course, Lithuania\ncouldn\u2019t de-defend itself, it was just too \u2014 too weak. The bases were inside already.\nBut still, I think they should have fought. They should have fought.",
        "Q: Were those kinds of discussions also going on, and did that feeling of betrayal\ncome once the terror started, or did it come once the bases started? If you can make\nsome \u2014 that kind of a distinction, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, 1-1- not the \u2014 not the bases. The bases somehow was accepted as in-in-\ninevitable. Estonia had that, Latvia had that, war was going on, you know, the\nsituation was unclear, how the war will develop was not clear. Somehow it looked\ntoo early to start and fight, you know, at that time. It \u2014 it looked like it\u2019s a right thing\nto play for time. And that was playing for time, but maybe we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re wrong. I\nmean, it would be much more effective fighting right \u2014 right there in 1939, but we\nwere not Finns, we were not that organized like Finns, so Lithuania couldn\u2019t bring\ndefend also, but would be more \u2014 would be more known, you know, would have\nattracted more attention in \u2014 in the world.",
        "Q: It s \u2014 it sounds like what was going on in Moscow, and what people knew in \u2014\nlike your family in Panev\u00e9zys, as plugged in as you were \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 to sources of information and contacts, that what really was developing was not\nknown, that \u2014 that people were not informed. That\u2019s the impression I get from your\ntelling.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Of \u2014 of these negotiations, quasi-negotiations \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that were going on.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Of course not, yeah, we didn\u2019t know at that time all the details. Now we \u2014 we find\nyou know, the documents, that memoirs, you know, we \u2014 we know \u2014 know much\nmore. So it \u2014 when I telling now the story, I have to watch myself to put myself in\nthat time, not what I know now about those \u2014 the things \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s exactly \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because I have read a lot of materials about those times, about negotiations,\nabout decisions being taken at that time. But at that time it looked like in 1939, was\ndistasteful and \u2014 and dangerous, but correct decision to accept the bases, playing for\ntime. But not resisting in 1940, it seemed like the really was \u2014 was, as I say, betrayal.\nIt was \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t a decision which could be justified, really. So when we were trying\nto fight the Soviets when the Germans attacked, it was desp \u2014 because Lithuania\ndidn\u2019t resist then, now we have to fight.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Now we have to fight to show, you know, that we \u2014 we \u2014 we want to be free, we\ndon\u2019t want to be occupied by anybody.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t want to be part of the Soviet Union.",
        "A: No, we don\u2019t want to \u2014 to be part of the Soviet Union, or of \u2014 of anything. No-\nNot of Poland, not for Germany. We want to be independent country. Our parents\nfo \u2014 our father fought for that, you know, and we want to have an independent\ncountry. That\u2019s \u2014 that was \u2014 that was the attitude.\n120October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back again to the fall of 1940, and then through the winter and the\nspring, people are arrested, the prison has 1t wo \u2014 its windows in the wa \u2014 in\nPanev\u00e9zys blocked off. The former government flees \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 disappears, is arrested. There are \u2014 there 1s a sense that the Jewish community,\nthe noisier part of it is pro-Soviet.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: No sense of \u2014 of how much anti-Soviet sense there is \u2014 sentiment there is. And\nwhat happens then, after that? I\u2019d like to \u2014 the next half year, let\u2019s say from January\n18, 1941 until when the Nazis invade the Soviet Union, and what \u2014 Lithuania is\nnow a part of it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What happens in that half year? [technical direction] How many minutes?\nQ2: About three.",
        "Q: Okay, fine, so we\u2019ll \u2014\nEnd of Tape Three\nOctober 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14\", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, I just\nasked you about what was the year \u2014 what was the next half year between January\nand June 1940, what events took place, what things developed, but I thought of\nanother question I wanted to ask, preceding that. And that 1s, of all these betrayals\nthat we\u2019re talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government, what\nwas left of it, betrayal by the, you know, small group of let\u2019s say refugees from\ntsarist Russia, who liked the idea of Russian domination, even if it was with their\ninternal enemies before, betrayal by the Jewish community, or betrayal by\nLithuanian \u2014 Gentile Lithuanians, ethnic Lithuanians, who were communists\nthemselves. Which betrayal do you think you felt in your heart most keenly? Or\nmaybe another betrayal?",
        "A: No, no. I think the Jewish, because several things. Russian community was so\nsmall that it was really insignificant. Our government, pretty \u2014 find out that there\nwas a split of opinion about that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military\ncommand. So \u2014 also, you know, difficult. Now, Jewish, proble \u2014 problem is that \u2014\nbecause maybe we were \u2014 or were \u2014 were mistaken, but we had the impression that\nthe Lithuanian Jewish relations are very good. That there is no ispy \u2014 th-there was\nsome Jewish communists, okay, you know \u2014 well, more than Lithuanian maybe,\n122October 14, 2010\npercentage-wise, but that was not really significant. The Jewish community\nsupported Lithuanians in the Vilnius question. They supported Lithuania\u2019s\nindependence, they \u2014 Smetona had very good relations with the Jewish community\u2019s\nleaders, you know? So we didn\u2019t see the reason why \u2014 we, as I said, maybe they felt\nbeing discriminated, because it was difficult for them, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 you know,\nto become officers in the army, in the police, and something like that. There was\nsome ethnic discrimination in Lithuania. But those who really wanted could, you\nknow, like Gensis(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian army, and very valued. So there",
        "Q: You\u2019re referring to Jakub Gens who ended \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 ended up being the \u2014",
        "A: Commandant \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 chief of police of Vilnius ghetto.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. He was a Lithuanian officer from the time of the Wars\nof Independence. He became officer in the Lithuanian military school, and had a\nvery distinguished career in Lithuanian army, in the war with Poland. So, just one\nexample, there were other officers, Jewish officers in Lithuanian army. But benda \u2014\ngenerally, Lithuania being a small country, just established, and in big tr \u2014 big\nconflict with Poland, and with Germany because of Klaip\u00e9da, were looking \u2014 they\n123October 14, 2010\nwere discriminating not according to religion or race or anything like that, but about\nthe perceived loyalty to the state. The most discriminated people, of course, were\nPolish. They just didn\u2019t trust any Pole that he wouldn\u2019t be just a spy, you know,\nsomewhere. So, for pr \u2014 a Pole got a government sensitive position was practically\nimpossible. Then, of course, Jews, because of some communists in there, you know,\nin the younger, and because of some cus \u2014 cosmopolo \u2014 cosmopolitic approach. A\nsophisticated approach which Lithuania looked at them kind of s-such small,\nridiculous state, you know. They were yus \u2014 universal people, they \u2014 they were not \u2014\nnot that much ag-gainst Lithuania, but ri \u2014 but discounting Lithuania. And that also\nfor having some \u2014 somebody like that in military or police would seem I-like risky,\nyou know, h-h-he doesn\u2019t care about this country. So then, Germans. Lithuanian\nGermans ou-outside Klaip\u00e9da were mostly loyal, very loyal, just like I told about\nthat, you know, which I re-reme \u2014 remember in Taurag\u00e9, Greigoris(ph), who \u2014 who\nrefused even to \u2014 to go to Germany. And the same thing in Panev\u00e9zys, most of the\nGermans are loyal, but Germans still, you know, some. And then later, you know,\nthere were Tartars and Karayims, there were no discrimination whatsoever. Their \u2014\ntheir religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, Karayims had their own religion,\nJewish based, you know. The race, you can s-see Karayim, you know, you could\nsee from \u2014 from the face, from the features. Nim \u2014 Kara \u2014 Tartars not so much, was\nKarayims. But that didn't matter at all. Their people even in \u2014 in the army made the\n124October 14, 2010\ncareer, good career, you know. There were generals, Tartars, there were colonels,\nKarayims, you know. They were as good or better than Lithuanians, no \u2014 no\nproblem. So, the base of discrimination was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority.",
        "Q: Well that \u2014 that sort of famous \u2014 I\u2019m so sorry I interrupted \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 the [indecipherable] you \u2014 a sort of well known sentiment, legitimate or not, in\nmost of the cases not legitimate, of a fifth column.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And is \u2014 being, you know, aware that we are \u2014 the country\nwas, you know, a small country, weak country in \u2014 in between dangerous other\ncountries. So that was one of the considerations, whether it \u2014 it was well taken or\nnot, you know, that\u2019s a different thing, but that was the basic feeling. And now,\nbasically, as I said, was the feeling that the Jewish community was a friendly\ncommunity and there were not really big conflict. There were some conflict in \u2014\ncommercial areas between Lithuania, but the government wasn\u2019t involved 1n that at\nall. Smetona\u2019s government was against any anti-Semitism at all. And \u2014 and the\npeople also, so \u2014",
        "Q: And yet there was acceptable, as far as what I\u2019ve read \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\n125October 14, 2010",
        "Q: \u2014 there, at least from some other historical sources that there \u2014 the rise of anti-\nSemitism throughout Europe in 1930s \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 did not \u2014 did not bypass Lithuania, that as the decade wore on, within the\nsociety itself \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 there were such sentiments. That\u2019s what many historians \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 have claimed. Do you think that there \u2014 those are \u2014 outside of any, you know,\nany events that we\u2019re talking about now, would you say that that has validity to it?",
        "A: Most likely so. It\u2019s difficult for me to say th \u2014 because we\u2019re talking about the\ncircle, my circle, my \u2014 my parents \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 my dear friends, my friends, classmates, I didn\u2019t feel that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: A-A-And all that circle, I din \u2014 didn\u2019t feel that. Yes, I knew there were some\nincidents, some 1-in between Lithuanian farmers and \u2014 and \u2014 and Jewish merchants,\nbut it \u2014 yeah, there were so, there was tension between Lithuanians coming into the\ncommercial area, trying to establish their businesses. There is a competition,\nsometimes this competition went out of bounds, you know, from both sides. The\n126October 14, 2010\nJews tried, you know, to establish some kind of mo-monopoly, and push out \u2014 that\nLithuanian out. Li-Lithuanian also, you know, appealing to some anti-se \u2014 anti-\nSemitic, you know, feelings. So, apparently there was, but I couldn\u2019t tell ma \u2014 much\nbecause it was way beyond my circle. In my circle that \u2014 this \u2014 this wasn\u2019t felt at all.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, there were some \u2014 for instance, there were some \u2014 some Jewish families\nchanged their house language, their family language from Yiddish to Russian, and\nLithuanians resented that, you know, he \u2014 he \u2014 they give up Yiddish, why then don\u2019t\n\u2014 they don\u2019t pick up Lithuanian? And Y1-Yiddish didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t bother anybody,\nHebrew didn\u2019t bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know? But \u2014 but \u2014\nbut I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in Lithuanian. So there\nwere those who did that, you know, and w-went to Lithuanian language. Even in this\nmuseum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto her d \u2014 her diary in Lithuanian because\nshe \u2014 she ju-just didn\u2019t know ji \u2014 Yiddish that well. So, there were \u2014 it was \u2014 1t was a\nbig community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no \u2014 or not, but in the\npeople there was a sense of betrayal because they thought that the relations were\ngood, and they didn\u2019t see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way,\nor much of the community, in particular the younger generation. The older\ngeneration, of course, didn\u2019t partici \u2014 participate in \u2014 in that, but as I said, they just \u2014\nthey just were in \u2014 behind the picture, you know. Nobody cared much about the \u2014 the\n127October 14, 2010\nrabbis or something like that, how \u2014 how they look at the things. Now, I also write in\nmy memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our \u2014 our family\u2019s friend was Dr.\nBridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his\nspecialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also\ndoctors. And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of \u2014 the first Soviet\noccupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish\ncommunity leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this\nreaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active \u2014 well, pro \u2014\npro-communist, younger, active people and talked with them, and asked them not \u2014\nnot to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds\nof times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people\nthey are living between. Tried to be neutral, you know, and th-th-they e \u2014 taking\nsides, they couldn\u2019t have survived, because they would also, you know, provoke a\nlot of hostility. And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone\ndown. And they said the younger \u2014 the young people just lef \u2014 la \u2014 just laughed at\nthem. The old people they don\u2019t understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob-\nobsolete and \u2014 and didn't want even to listen to them. So apparently even in the\nJewish community, there was some perception that somebody is o-overdoing the\nthings. Now, was \u2014 as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you\nknow, they we \u2014 they were \u2014 they were 1-in \u2014 invisible, they tried to be-become\n128October 14, 2010\ninvisible. Now you asking about the period from \u2014 in early 1940s. Really the\nbreakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 1940, August, I think the third or fifth,\nabout that time. Right after the annexation, the thing changed. Now the terror\nintensified consid \u2014 considerably, and the resistance started getting organized. So\nnow, la \u2014 a lot of people, even in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and\nAr-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance. But even the [indecipherable]\nresistance, the people who were prominent in the \u2014 in the society generally, most of\nthem were arrested, th-thousands now. Now it became a mass thing. Now there was\nnationa \u2014 nationalization; the business establishments, commercial establishments,\nindustrial things were nationalized. I was my-myself, we \u2014 we s-students had to go\nthere, write, you know, in the \u2014 whatever belongs to that merchant establishment,\nand to be nationalized with the owners. Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian\nowner who owns some business or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or business establishment, they \u2014 they\nwere just thrown out. Now the Jewish, usually you know, still remain there as a\nspecialist. Just because usually there were some in the family, or in \u2014 1n their circle\nwho had influence with the new government. So apparently they tried, you know, to\nhelp each other. And pretty ba \u2014 became pretty obvious, you know, the things are\nnationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before. Of\ncourse now, in government\u2019s name, for \u2014 in government\u2019s account, Lithuanians are\njust without a job, you know, just \u2014 just waiting around. What\u2019s the matter, you\n129October 14, 2010\nknow, it\u2019s always the \u2014 these \u2014 these things started accumulating. The resentment\nagainst the Jewish reaction increased strongly. As the terror increased, increased the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the reaction. Also, because some of them, you know, even communist\nJews went into the security e-e-establishment.",
        "Q: Were these people known by name, or was this just what was dis \u2014 this was\nunderstood, or discussed, I mean, what was the basis of this point of view, this \u2014 this\n\u2014 this belief that there were Jews in the security establishment?",
        "A: Well, they were visible.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They went, they arrested people, they interrogated people, they \u2014 yeah, th-th-they\n\u2014 after annexation, everything became visible. Th-They \u2014 they didn't \u2014 the terror \u2014\nconcealed terror is not a terror. I mean, they \u2014 and then the terror really started after\nthe annexation. It really \u2014 what we suspected, what we were afraid, now, you know,\ncame to fruition. Now you didn\u2019t have to be afraid, you knew. You knew. That\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how it is. That\u2019s how it is, that\u2019s how it will be. And it \u2014 it \u2014 it gets stronger\nand stronger, more and more people arrested, until the big deportations.",
        "Q: Well, tell us about the big deportations. What happened then? When did it\nhappen, and what happened?",
        "A: Well, it was in \u2014 1n \u2014 in naja \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly the date, but that\u2019s 1941,\nJune 14 maybe? About that, 14 - 13. Yeah, one night, you know, coming \u2014 well, in\n130October 14, 2010\nmy 0-op-opinion. We were walking with my father through Panev\u00e9zys. There was \u2014\nno, that was different, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s start of the war. Suddenly, you know,\nof \u2014 we \u2014 we got up one morning and saw that, you know, our friends are being \u2014\nbeing taking, arrested and being taking to the railroad station. I was working in the\nmiddle of the city, and I saw, you know, a \u2014 a\u2014 a truck going there, you know, an\nopen truck, and I saw, you know, the family we knew, who was my father\u2019s, really,\nsuperior for a time. We saw that family, the old \u2014 the old lady there, and their girl\nand him, you know, in that truck, and soldiers with the s-set bayonets around them,\nbeing taking to the railroad station. And \u2014 and a lot of people. Our teachers\ndisappeared, you know. Our teacher o-of the Russian language was a Lithuanian\ndiplomat, he was arrested, there was no Russian class there. He died from s-\nstarvation in Siberia. And so, you know, anybody could, there was no reason, there\n\u2014 pretty soon there was no reason \u2014 we couldn\u2019t detect the reason who is safe. Yeah,\nwell, the members of the communist party, and the \u2014 of the communist activists,\nthose who really contributed, who we-were working on the deportation, maybe they\nwere Safe, but nobody else. There was no, you know, anybody could be arrested,\nanybody could be deported.",
        "Q: Did you know at that point, when you saw the truck, the open truck, that this \u2014\nthis was a \u2014 a deportation that was a mass deportation, or did you see many trucks go\nOctober 14, 2010\nto the train station? Wa \u2014 can you kind of draw us a picture? What was it that you\nsaw, and what you understood.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I didn\u2019t see too many because most of them went during the\nnighttime, and I don\u2019t know why this family was picked up \u2014 we-well, there were\nmore people, not only this family in the truck.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But th-that was like after action actions, you know, something \u2014 people they\nmight \u2014 might missed or something.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But pretty soon we knew, I mean th-the railroad station was full of people, you\nknow, the trains were full, and they were pushing those people, w-we \u2014 we knew,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Did you go to the train station?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I didn't. I-I didn\u2019t want to risk be \u2014 because I \u2014 we didn\u2019t know, w-\nwe didn\u2019t know \u2014 now we know, you know, aba \u2014 apparently how that was done, but\nat that time there was no \u2014 no understanding what was going on and woo \u2014 who is 1n\ndanger, who is not. My mother opened \u2014 and tr-tried to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to think what \u2014\nwhat we should take to go into Siberia, you know, now. And \u2014 and that was open\nbox, and she didn\u2019t put anything 1n th \u2014 she just \u2014 just was paralyzed, you know, and\nthat\u2019s it, you know, we don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know it \u2014 we were sho \u2014\n132October 14, 2010\nwe were shocked. We were shocked, we didn\u2019t expect anything like that. They were\nsaying, oh, your prostitutes are taking to \u2014 to Siberia, they will learn how to work.\nProstitutes, the \u2014 the kids, the families, you know.",
        "Q: Does that Ukrainian au pair still living in the house?",
        "A: Yeah, but \u2014 but they were very rarely at home. Th-The ka \u2014 this \u2014 the red army\nwas on some kind of alert already, so they were mostly at their bases, wherever that\nwas.",
        "Q: And at that point, did you connect the dots and see what she was saying, or even\nthen there was such confusion, that you had no idea that this could be Siberia, the\nSiberia she was telling you to prepare for.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we connected that. We connected. And we \u2014 particular the Russian\nliterature, the Soviet literature we had \u2014 we had to read, you know, some of the\nSholokhov\u2019s novels, and there is about de-deportations. And couldn\u2019t understand, I\nmean, so-some \u2014 some silly thing, some unrealistic thing. I mean, they come, they\narrest the farmers there, you know, they bring them to Siberia, but what for, I mean,\nwhat did they do, and the whole family? Why \u2014 why the whole family? If the farmer\ndid something wrong, you know, hm. We di-didn\u2019t understand. It \u2014 it looks kind of\nsilly to me, I \u2014 but then I remembered, then I remembered that \u2014 that \u2014 that day.",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014 and then what happened?\n133October 14, 2010",
        "A: Ye \u2014 oh \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on to \u2014 to the extent that oh, some of the\npeople we know, you know, when the \u2014 they came for them to be deported, the \u2014 the\nfather of the family, the man, ran away. He saw, you know, somebody coming, he\nthought they\u2019re coming to arrest him, because there were so many arrests, you\nknow? But n-not the families, there were people arrested, whoever was, you know,\nthey wanted to arrest. So they ran away and ha \u2014 hid, and their family was taken and\ndep \u2014 brought to the railroad station. Now, the man realizing that, came out, went to\nthe railroad station, and whatever happens, he wanted to be with his family. He\ndidn\u2019t realize that families were broken up, that the men were sent to concentration\ncamps, and the families were sent to the \u2014 to the Siberian farms and something like\nthat. So you see, even at the moment, people were so \u2014 that confused, didn\u2019t know,\nyou know, the method what was going on. So there was no sense for him because he\nwas \u2014 he wasn\u2019t let to go with his family.",
        "Q: But he was taken?",
        "A: He was ta \u2014 oh, of course, yeah, he was taken, yeah. And very few survived there,\ni-in there, in particular the first deportation. But, as I say, we realized that the Jews\nare also being deported, yes, and quite \u2014 quite many of them.",
        "Q: How did you realize this?",
        "A: Well, we saw, I mean, people just disappearing all \u2014 all around you. Ma \u2014 my\nfriend Rubinsteinas(ph), his family. Our \u2014 our classmate Borokas(ph), his family,\n134October 14, 2010\nthey are deported. They were lucky. They were lucky, they didn\u2019t know. At that time\nwe were \u2014 thought it means how \u2014 how bad, how cruel, but they had 50 - 50 chance\nof survival in Siberia. My friend Rubinstein(ph) survived, and Borokas(ph)\nsurvived. They \u2014 they would \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether Borokas(ph) was visiting\nLithuania, you know, now, and Rubinstein(ph) I don\u2019t \u2014 he married local girl,\nstayed there in Russia. Whether he visited Lithuania, I don\u2019t know. And\n[indecipherable] but at that time it looked \u2014 the horror, the same horror as for the\nothers. But many Jewish activists were acting in that deportation. So, again, you\nknow, it should have been more. The \u2014 the people still didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t quite, you\nknow \u2014 just because Jews are being deported, didn\u2019t quite, you know, justify the\nwhole Jewish community because of that, because the activists still were there, you\nknow. Not the only ones, but there were quite a few of them, quite many. Clear\nmajority of the civilians taking care of that, except the Russian soldiers, of course.\nSo \u2014",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying a clear majority of those who participated in deportations\nhappened to be Jewish?",
        "A: I would say so, I would say so. From what I hear, you know, they say the Jews,\nthe Jews, the Jews deported, you know, I don\u2019t know. I didn't take any samples or\nanything like that, but from what I heard, yeah, 1t seemed so. Well, majority was\nRussian soldiers.\n135October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: They were in each \u2014 in each group was one or two. Well, two, at least two,\nsometimes more.",
        "Q: What happened then, after this, after these deportations?",
        "A: Well, they stopped for a \u2014 just few days.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We- we have the feeling that it will resume, that \u2014 and \u2014 and that was right.\nLater we find out th-that the \u2014 they just \u2014 they just \u2014 system, you know, the railroads,\neverything, they had to make a break, and then they would have resume. So we had\nthe feeling that they \u2014 it will resume, but was just a days, and the Germans attacked.",
        "Q: So the war started for Lithuania then?",
        "A: The war started for Lithuania June a \u2014 a\u2014 deportations started in June 14\", I\nwould say, so continued about three days more, maybe \u2014 no, it\u2019s three \u2014 well, 14, 15,\n16, maybe 17, I don\u2019t know. And 19, 20, oh yeah, and 22, June 22, the Germans\nattacked.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when you last saw go \u2014 Uditta(ph) Gormanas(ph)?",
        "A: Yeah, few \u2014 few \u2014 a\u2014a day after that, a day after that \u2014",
        "Q: A day.",
        "A: \u2014I saw Uditta(ph).\n136October 14, 2010",
        "Q: So where were you when you heard news of the German attack? Do you\nremember?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I remember. I was sleeping. I was sleeping. We \u2014 we graduated from\nour high school. There was supposed to be \u2014 no matter deportations, there was\nsupposed to be a picnic in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 1n Berchunai(ph), which 1s a resort near\nPanev\u00e9zys. We had to go that \u2014 that day, that Sunday. And suddenly there was a\nthunder, a very strong thunder, and I thought, my goodness, th-there goes the picnic,\nyou know, that is a thunderstorm. And then there was an explosion. I mean, I\nthought it\u2019s thunder, but somehow the sound came through the \u2014 through the ground,\nnot through the air. Such a strong that our small house, you know, just \u2014 just \u2014",
        "Q: Shook?",
        "A: \u2014 swayed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Ish \u2014no \u2014 stood up shock a-and went out outside to see what\u2019s going on. There\nwas no storm, there were no clouds. The sky was clear, and pani \u2014 Pajuoste were \u2014\nwas the military base behind Panev\u00e9zys, there was a huge cloud going up of the\nexplosion, apparently, huge cloud. And there were a lot of planes ou \u2014 in the sky, but\nthey were high up. Now, what\u2019s going on here, you know, something exploded in \u2014\nin \u2014 in \u2014 1n\u20141n Pajuoste, definitely. So \u2014 and then I saw, you know, it suddenly, I\nthink five planes came through, pretty low. Yellow s \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 yellow\n137October 14, 2010\nsigns and the black crosses, black \u2014 oh \u2014 oh, I knew the German military sign \u2014 1-\ninsignia. Black crosses, that was German military \u2014 military planes, black planes, so\nthat was clear. Five, in formation going there, you know, on \u2014 over Panev\u00e9zys. So\nthat \u2014 that was war.",
        "Q: And [indecipherable]",
        "A: Then my mother came out, you know, and we started dancing, they are not going\nto defe \u2014 deport us to Siberia, see? War was salvation.",
        "Q: For you.",
        "A: For us, yeah, right. Yeah.",
        "Q: When did you first see a German soldier?",
        "A: There were a few days ca \u2014 went by, I came back from home, and we were \u2014 we\nwere \u2014 also dur \u2014 during the nighttime we went outside, there was a \u2014 a small\nbuilding, really without windows, so we thought rather a safe place, so we decided to\no-over \u2014 stay overnight there. And we heard, you know, we heard cars going on,\nmotorcycles, commands, but very difficult to say, commands in any language sounds\nsimilar. And suddenly a motorcycle went through our street very quickly. Most\nlikely it was already the German, but we stayed inside until morning, and in the\nmorning somebody come running and said, Germans are in the town.",
        "Q: Was this the day after you \u2014 the day after the war started, or a few days \u2014\n138October 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, Panev\u00e9zys were not that fast, yeah. Vilnius, Kaunas\n[indecipherable], it\u2019s surprising Vilnius was taken first, when \u2014 before Kaunas, and\nLithuanians rewa \u2014 you know, took over Vilnius even before Germans attacked.\nThen Kaunas the same thing. But Panev\u00e9zys was between the German armored\nattacks. It was not that important military center, so it came \u2014 I think it was 26\".\nWarsaw the 22, the re \u2014 Lithuanian insurrection started 23, and Panev\u00e9zys was\ntaken, I think, 26.",

        "A: Nothing much, the \u2014 because nobody had weapons, organization was broken\ndown by deportations. They was supposed to get weapons su \u2014 from somewhere, but\nthe people who were supposed to get those weapons, some of them were deported,\nthe other went into hiding. One went to Kaunas, participated the \u2014 in the revolt\nthere. And \u2014",

        "A: But that \u2014 that was factual information, as we found out. It wasn\u2019t a \u2014 a rumor.\nYeah, so \u2014",
        "Q: Did you stay at home during these days that \u2014",
        "A: No, no, w-we decided t \u2014 we didn't find any we-weapons, we didn\u2019t do anything\nuseful, so my friend and myself decided to go to a neighboring vil-village behind the\nOctober 14, 2010\ncity, and \u2014 to see may the \u2014 maybe there the Sauliai have hidden some weapons,\nmaybe so. So we went there, didn\u2019t find anything. Yeah, ba \u2014 the Soviet m-mili \u2014\nSoviet mi-military came upon, you know, and were ch \u2014 starting shooting at us, so\nwe ran away and hid. And we sit \u2014 sit there for two or three days, and then I decided\nto come back to Panev\u00e9zys, and I came back and the city was kind of dead. In \u2014 in\nthe early afternoon there were nobody watching the streets except the military patrol\n\u2014 patrols.",
        "Q: And this was Soviet still military?",
        "A: Soviet, Soviet, yeah, so \u2014 so when I \u2014 when I saw them or heard them, I just made\na \u2014 a turnaround through other streets, you know, and came home, finally without \u2014\nwithout meeting any of them directly, face to face. Meanwhile, the prison was\nevacuated and many of the people were being killed at the sugar factory. But if \u2014",
        "Q: Why were they being killed at the sugar \u2014 sugar factory 1s just a place where \u2014\nwhere candy was manufactured, or sugar was \u2014",
        "A: No, sugar, sugar, sugar.",
        "Q: \u2014 sugar was manufactured?",
        "A: Well, it was just apparently convenient place, I don\u2019t know, they just dig the \u2014 the\nditches and kill the people. They were mostly from \u2014 from other towns brought to\nPanev\u00e9zys.\n142October 14, 2010",
        "Q: So it was used as a quasi prison or a holding place and \u2014 and a \u2014 and then became\nan execution site?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I would say so, yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But th-then the prison became empty and some of the prisoner \u2014 pr \u2014 people who\nworked in the prison [indecipherable] my mother. My father was digging di \u2014\ndigging anti \u2014 anti-aircraft, you know, well ditches, how do you call, you know?",
        "Q: Trenches?",
        "A: Trenches, yes. So he was not home, I was not home, my mother was home. So he\n\u2014 she \u2014 she thought that I might be arrested there, and they arrested. The NKVD\narrested a lot of young people in the streets, including my friends.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So my fr \u2014 wh-wh-when my mother knew that, you know, the \u2014 was told that the\nNKVD, the Soviet secret police left the prison, she told other people in the\nneighborhood that, let\u2019s go there and \u2014 and let people out, you know, from the\nprison. So one of the neighbors brought a ladder, came over, you know, opened the \u2014\nthe gate, and went to the prison. Some of the prisoners were already breaking out\nfrom their cells, but it was very slow thing, so he showed where the keys are, and\nopened all the keys, and suddenly prison was empty. All this young people came out\ninto the neighboring houses, and meanwhile NK VD came back. They \u2014 they had\n143October 14, 2010\nsomebody guarding, and gave a signal that they are coming back, so everybody\ndisappeared and they came back to the empty \u2014 empty prison. Well, was too late to\ndo anything, it was hours before the Germans appeared. But still, you know, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 they \u2014 they knocked out a German \u2014 a \u2014 a Soviet tank somewhere you know, I\ndon\u2019t know, he was late, some [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how \u2014 how it\nwas.",
        "Q: Now, in many places, pogroms started even before the Germans came.",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "Q: Did that happen in Panev\u00e9zys as far as you know\u201d?",
        "A: No, no.",

        "A: No, I \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 my \u2014 what I know, what I have seen, 1s limited.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I realize that, you know, [indecipherable] from what I read, was completely\ndifferent in Kaunas. The Germans came in right there and started anti-Jewish\nactions right there involving Lithuanians. In Vilnius also pretty soon like that. But\nPanev\u00e9zys the Germans didn\u2019t care about anything except their military tasks,\nwhatever they had. And nobody attacked Jews until \u2014 until the funeral of the doctors\nand the other people who were killed by the Soviets.\n144October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Tell us about how they were killed, the doctors, and then what was this funeral,\nwhen was it, and why was this a catalyst?",
        "A: Why the doctors were killed is \u2014 1s \u2014 I\u2014 ou \u2014 nobody really understands.",
        "Q: What were the circumstances of \u2014",
        "A: The doctors were operating on Soviet soldiers which were injured by the German\nbombing of Pajuoste. They were brought to the hospital and the doctors, the\nsurgeons were working on them, operating, and the nurse also, she \u2014 she works wi-\nwith the doctors. Now, somebody said that somebody broken into the hospital\nlooking for weapons, because the soldiers brought to the hospital, they thought\nmaybe they could get weapons there. Which is nonsense, nobody brought them with\nthe be \u2014 weapons. I mean, they were injured \u2014 injured soldiers, so they were brought\nto the hospital, the weapons stayed wherever they were serving. But I don\u2019t know\nhow much is rumor, how much is right, but in any case, there were some communist\nyouth guards in the hospital and they telephoned the security that somebody is trying\nto break into the hospital.",
        "Q: That is the secret police, the Soviet \u2014",
        "A: Secret police, yeah. And then the secret police came, took the doctors, took the\nnurse and just \u2014 just killed them \u2014 not \u2014 not just shot, but really, you know, murder \u2014\nmurdered them to \u2014 to death, you know, by \u2014 by \u2014 by horrible, horrible torture.\nHow? It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s nonsense, I mean, the doctors, I d\u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\n145October 14, 2010",
        "Q: And you found out about thi \u2014",
        "A: I-It would \u2014 you see, the people \u2014 the people are most dangerous, and most cruel\nwhen they are very afraid. Russians were, at that time, they were afraid. They were\nsu-suddenly confronted with the German action, which was very powerful, and they\nwere afraid, they \u2014 they \u2014 they realized that all the surroundings are hostile to them,\nthe Lithuanian surroundings, so they were terrified. And terrified people are\ndangerous people, because they are irrational then, and they just \u2014 so-so that \u2014 that\u2019s\n\u2014 that\u2019s my observation from that. So I \u2014 that\u2019s how I can explain that, because there\nis \u2014 does \u2014 doesn\u2019t make any sense, there were n-no weapons in the \u2014 in the hospital\nand no possibility of the weapons [indecipherable] real, you know. So so-somebo \u2014\nsomebody got scared, confused, you know.",
        "Q: And so \u2014 and they did away with them.",
        "A: Oh, of course, yeah, then the funeral, bu-but not only the doctors, but also the\npeople, about I don\u2019t know, 20 - 30 people at the \u2014 at this sugar factory, various\npeople who were arrested by securities earlier. There, you know, in command, was\nthat Lithuanian communist who was living 1n our house. He was in command of that\nexecution.",
        "Q: Abh. Ah.",
        "A: And th-there \u2014 there was different, there they \u2014 they were executing because they\nthought, I mean, this 1s anti-Soviet people. Ma \u2014 so then th \u2014 not \u2014 not in such a fear\n146October 14, 2010\nand as \u2014 as in the case of the doctors. Now, nobody until now, I never heard that\nanybody would men \u2014 mention that any Jew was involved in that. We don\u2019t know\nRussian security personnel, maybe there were, maybe there were not, but nobody\nestablished that any Jew ba \u2014 that Lithuanian was 1s \u2014 in command, you know, at the\nsugar factory that wo \u2014",
        "Q: So, another betrayal of a \u2014 of the worst kind, 1s a \u2014 it is a Lithuanian who is a\ncommunist \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 who 1s killing his own people?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Yeah, so \u2014 so there was no \u2014 no reason for any anti-Jewish action,\nbut there was. After the funeral, I went [indecipherable] they said they are beating\nJews. Well, I went to see wha \u2014 where, you know, and really we saw it, you know,\nthe people were just standing and watching. And three, maybe four, most likely three\nburly men were hitting, you know, at the small houses there \u2014 there were Jewish s-\nstores, you know, several Jewish stores at that place. They were just breaking the\nwindows, the doors, you know, beating it up. And the people were just standing and\nwatching what\u2019s going on. Nobody said, you know, anything to them, to those three\npeop-people there. Obviously they were a \u2014 a \u2014 there were Jews there, you know,\n147October 14, 2010\nliving in there. And suddenly a man came out with a bl-bloody face, apparently a\nJew. And when the people saw the blood, you know, all this group of people who\nwere standing yo \u2014 just stepped back, you know, maybe three steps back and dis-\ndispersed right there. They were calling, you know, to join the people, but nobody\njoined them.",
        "Q: The three burly men were calling to \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 have people join them.",
        "A: Yeah, but we \u2014 nobody joined, but no-nobody even objected to anything.",
        "Q: Okay, so nobody condemned, either.",
        "A: No. Well, I think it was implied, condemnation. It was implied. People \u2014 people,\nbut \u2014",
        "Q: But they didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t say \u2014 they say \u2014 didn\u2019t say anything, yeah. And they just dispersed,\nand \u2014 obviously they were sent from somewhere, you know. Obviously some \u2014 some\n[indecipherable] tha-that was not s \u2014 anything spontaneous. But \u2014",
        "Q: Is that the first vi \u2014 anti-Jewish violence that you saw \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys?",
        "A: Yes.\n148October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And do you think there was a connection between the funeral of these \u2014 you\nknow, these people who were victims of the NK VD and that Lithuanian communist\nand whatever you know, units or rule that he had? Do y \u2014 do you think it was just\ncoincidence that it happened this way?",
        "A: No, not a coincidence, but a \u2014 somebody wanted to establish a relationship, which\nwasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Since nobody appro \u2014 nobody co \u2014 even \u2014 even from the [indecipherable]\nnobody accused that Jews were involved. In other places there were such a \u2014 such\naccusations, I read, but not in Panev\u00e9zys. Until now, nobody mentions that any Jew\nwas involved in those actions, doctors or sugar fac \u2014 factory, no. So apparently\nsomebody want to make a connection, sent those three men there, you know, maybe\npaid them, and tried to \u2014",
        "Q: And do you think a connection was made?",
        "A: \u2014 in-insight them. I don\u2019t know. Not as \u2014 as far as me is concerned, but I don\u2019t\nknow about the other people. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think that even after that,\nnobody \u2014 nobody talked ab-about the Jews in connection with that \u2014 with those br \u2014",
        "Q: Incidents.\n149October 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 those incidents, yeah. So \u2014",
        "Q: What happened \u2014 okay, so there\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s this period of four days between the\nSoviet retreat, come back, retreat, come back, and the German final establishment in\nthe town.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And you \u2014 you \u2014 you first saw the planes and so on. When it finally was\nestablished, that is, there was no return of any Soviet forces, is that when the funeral\ntook place? Was it at that point \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, several days after that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Several days after that, I don\u2019t know how many \u2014 you know, two or \u2014 two \u2014 at\nleast two, maybe three days after that, because the Germans had time to bring\nforeign journalists from Berlin by plane, they brought to Panev\u00e9zys to show the\njournalists what the Russians have done.",
        "Q: Ah, a propaganda move.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, a-and the journalists, even American journalists were there because America\nwas not in war at that time yet with Germany. American and Swiss, Swedish. And I\nknow about that story because there was one Lithuanian from Klaip\u00e9dos, Klaip\u00e9da\n150October 14, 2010\narea. He was very much anti-German, his whole life anti-German, but he knew\nlanguages, and he \u2014 he was a refugee when the Germans took over Klaip\u00e9da, he\nlived in Panev\u00e9zys. But he was kind of drafted, or asked as a translator for the\njournalists. Journalists knew German, but not the real Lithuanian kn-knew German\ngood enough.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And he knew. So, the Germans brought them to those doctors and others and\nshowed the places, and then later there was kind of like, I don\u2019t know, like place for\n\u2014 for them to wait until the plane was ready to take them back. And this Lithuanian\ntranslator whom I \u2014 who \u2014 was also our family friend, so he was telling us that one\nof the American journalists took him away and said, look, you know, this, all those\nkilled people, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what the Germans did, didn\u2019t they? He said no, no, no,\nthat \u2014 that was Soviets. Oh, he says, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s clear, that\u2019s clear, thank you. And\nthen he wanted to \u2014 to \u2014 to talk with him and the American wouldn\u2019t talk with him at\nall. So the German propaganda didn\u2019t take, I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 that \u2014 at least this\njournalist was convinced that was a German \u2014",
        "Q: Action.",
        "A: \u2014 action. And this, from \u2014 from Klaip\u00e9da, who all his life was fighting against\nthe Germans, and e-even until \u2014 he always was, even after that inc \u2014 incident, but \u2014\nbut he was upset about the \u2014 th-the western prejudices.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: And he \u2014 th \u2014 it sounds like the western journalist, the American journalist, was\nlooking upon him, the translator as being in the service of the Germans, because it\nserved the German propaganda privasses.",
        "A: Right, right. Well, apparently he was convinced that the Russians don\u2019t do such\nthings, nome \u2014 and the Germans do. Which is true as \u2014 as far as the Germans are\nconcerned, just the first \u2014 just the first part not \u2014 not true.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So let\u2019s go forward.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And the funeral happens, you see the \u2014 this beating up of \u2014 of Jews and their\nhouses by these three men. And then what happens within Panev\u00e9zys? How do\nthings develop further?",
        "A: Well, horribly, because there were a lot of killing. Revenge killing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: People, you know, ju-just under suspicion that somebody was in the communist\nyouth organization or something, were taken out and shot, without any 1-inquiry,\nwithout any court, without any pro-procedure, just like that, you know, and a lot of\ninnocent people were just killed, like this \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys and in surrounding\nvillages, like that. It was terrible. Some of them were Jewish, I don\u2019t know how\nmany of those, but definitely just some \u2014 some Jews were killed. Some Lithuanians,\nsome Russians, whatever.\n152October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Do y \u2014 was this done \u2014 was this done without German involvement? Was this sort\nof like a [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Without.",
        "A: Ja\u2014 that was just Lithuanian project.",

        "A: Not \u2014 not a project, there was a staff, you know, just when the Germans marched\n\u2014 marched in, I saw the Germans right there, you know, at my gymnasium, and the\ngirls were, you know, greeting them with flowers and \u2014 and milk and water and\n[indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] and one of our classmates who ran\naway to Germany was \u2014 I didn\u2019t see him, but he went by, you know, he was drafted\nby Germans as translator, going through Lithuania. So we \u2014 Lithuanian flags\neverywhere. The only German flag under their military establishment, and even that\nflag was a war flag, not the regular German flag.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, according to that, that\u2019s kind of correct, I mean, that\u2019s the army. They don\u2019t\nclaim that \u2014 that city or that part. So \u2014 and there was a staff, Lithuanian staff is \u2014\nthey said, I went there, you know, and so \u2014 volunteered for 1n \u2014 ins \u2014 in service there.\nThey gave me a \u2014 arifle, the automatic Russian \u2014 automatic rifle, ammunition, and a\n\u2014a-\u2014how do you call it, armband.\n153October 14, 2010",

        "A: It was red.",

In Panev\u00e9zys it was red, but it was \u2014 it\nhad insignias, it \u2014 different insignia. And that\u2019s it, we went into th \u2014 into the service\nthere.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Apparently some from our service were killing people, apparently. I don\u2019t know,\nafter that, whe-when they were killing, apparently they felt like big heroes, you\nknow. Like \u2014",
        "Q: Killing anti-com \u2014 killing communists, killing Jews?",
        "A: Yeah, killing communists.",

They suspected they\nare communists, that\u2019s \u2014 something like that. Anyway, not the families \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: And were these people who \u2014 who were, you know, when you volunteered, and\nothers, were they all about your age, about 18 - 19 at the time, or \u2014",
        "A: They were sa \u2014 yes, well, the lower, ba \u2014 ba \u2014 could be \u2014 could be higher than\nthat, too. In their 20s something, up to 26 - 27 maybe. Something like that. So, pretty\nsoon, you know, the people in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys were very concerned about that, that\ninnocent people are being killed, so they had contacted the leadership of that staff,\nand you know, said \u2014 and then, you know, the \u2014 the staff \u2014 staff was responsible,\nthey get weapons. Th-Th-They have those armbands. So after that they stopped this\nthing.",
        "Q: What did they a \u2014 what had been your duties? You weren\u2019t involved in that, but\nwhat had they asked you to do?",
        "A: Well, my first duty, or first thing, we \u2014 they \u2014 they send me to Pajuoste together\nwith others in \u2014 in \u2014 1n a truck, to pick up the ammunition.

        "Q: And 1s that when you had last seen Uditta(ph) Gormanas(ph), at that point, or at",
        "A: No, no, that before, that\u2019s \u2014",

So we went back to staff, said to them, and Germans didn\u2019t let us pick up\nany more. Okay. So then tol \u2014 they told me to take a group of my friends and go and\nsee the \u2014 there 1s a report that some communists, or maybe even Russian soldiers,\nstraggling soldiers are in a big building, Meistas(ph) factory, or a\u2014 a b \u2014 a building,\nthat they might be hiding there.",

        "A: Task.",
        "Q: \u2014 task. And you returned to your headquarters?",
        "A: My headquarters, gave the pistol, the am-ammunition, gave the money, gave the\nnote and the translation, and that was a day\u2019s work done. So went back home with\nmy friends, and my father met us with the \u2014 a toast for a free and independent\nLithuania, which we thought it\u2019s being established now, because all the city was\nOctober 14, 2010\njust in Lithuanian national colors, and the flags, except for one building where the\nGerman commandant was \u2014 took over the place. So \u2014 so tha \u2014 at that pla \u2014 what we\nthought is going \u2014 going to happen, there will be, well maybe not quite independent,\nbut something like Hungary, or \u2014 or Slovakia, something like that, you know, that\nwe will \u2014 will be independent country together with \u2014 with Germany, you know,\nallied willingly or not. And then the other day, I went to the police, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, do-don\u2019t remember exactly, went to the police, and \u2014 but I remember the view,\nwhich was very shocking to me. There was an old man, apparently a Jew, an old\nman, you know, and he was standing like in the corner, and on his forehead was\nwritten in, I would say maybe it looked like wet ashes, you know, make something\nlike that and then smear on that, and it was called Zydas.",
        "Q: In Lithuanian.",
        "A: In Lithuanian.",
        "Q: So that means Jew.",
        "A: Jew.",
        "Q: And he was inside the police station?",
        "A: And he was inside the police station, was standing in the corner, the people were\ngoing around their business there, you know, nobody was paying any attention to\nhim as far as I could see. I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I just left that police and j-just stays in my\n162October 14, 2010\nmemory, you know, bec-because it was such a shocking, shocking view for me, for\nme.",
        "Q: Was he \u2014 do \u2014 was he \u2014 you say he was an old man, do you remember what he\nlooked like? Was he small, was he large?",
        "A: No, he was small, he was bald, yeah. That \u2014 that \u2014 that was very shocking to me,\nthat\u2019s why I remember it. Well, I went back home, then didn\u2019t have any di \u2014 nothing\nwhen I went to staff, they had nothing for me for awhile. We met some Germans, we\ndrank with them. My school German became conversational, but my \u2014 when we are\n\u2014 get drunk, you don\u2019t have inhibitions, so it\u2019s mech \u2014 much earlier \u2014 easier to learn.\nThe Germans were very friendly, the soldiers. They were \u2014 they were soldiers, that\u2019s\nall they c-cared, you know, they wer \u2014 they were fighting their \u2014 the war, and no\npolitics, nothing her-here. They were friendly people. Now, another day I went, and\nthey had another task to me. And the Russians \u2014 the railroad was a regular western\nEuropean railroad in Lithuania, the width. The Russian railroads had different\nwidth. So when the Russians took over, they made a more wide, you know, on the \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, a wider [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 the Russian \u2014 a Russian standard. Now, the Germans wanted us to bring it back\nto the west European, German, or previous Lithuanian standard. So I had to \u2014 to \u2014 to\ngo to the prison. There was prisoners of war, Russians, Soviets, you know,\nUkrainians, whatever. I had to take 120 - 150 of them and bring to the railroad, and\n163October 14, 2010\nlet them work on the railroad bringing the \u2014 the \u2014 the rail width to the regular side.\nAnd, to watch what \u2014 with my friends also, to watch them, you know, working there.\nSo that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: So you guarded them, in other words.",
        "A: We guarded them, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 they were working there. It was easy \u2014 well, of course, not very\neasy, easy because th-there were, you know, before, that width, so it was just re-\nreturn to the old place. And it was narrower, so it\u2019s no problem, n-no \u2014 no \u2014 no need\nto extend anything or something. But, you know, the rails are heavy, you have to \u2014 to\nlift them and bring it, and so \u2014 so it was w-work, you know [indecipherable] many\nof them. Now, I was the control. The Ukrainians were very happy people there. They\nwere, you know, full of fun, you know, they \u2014 they had all kinds of funny stories,\nand I s-started, you know, to talk with them.",
        "Q: In Russian?",
        "A: In Russian, yeah. They said, you know, all \u2014 they were all happy. They knew the\nwar was over, will be over in months, they go back to free Ukraine, everything will\nbe just fine. And I saw that I lost, I mean, you know, a war discipline, they \u2014 they are\nnot working, they are just entertaining me. So, I had problem, you know, until I\n[indecipherable] on them to work. The Russians were very up \u2014 not very, but they\n164October 14, 2010\nare upset, sad, you know. They were working, but obviously they \u2014 they \u2014 they were\nnot happy, not like Ukrainians, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a very big difference between. There were\nother nationalities. There was one of them, they knew no Russian.",
        "Q: But it was a Soviet soldier?",
        "A: It was a Soviet soldier, he was from Kaukas(ph) or somewhere, th-the Russians\ntold me, he is from Kaukas(ph), so he doesn\u2019t know any Russian. Yeah, so I don\u2019t\nknow who he was, but di \u2014 you showed to him, he-he did, you know, whatever. They\nnever \u2014 I wa \u2014 I never asked them, but they never complained, th-they \u2014 I never\nasked how they are fed or something like that, but apparently there were no problem,\nbecause nobody complained to me that they didn't have hot food or anything.",
        "Q: How did they look?",
        "A: They look alright to me. There 1s just a few days \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 they became p-prisoners of war. They were under Lithuanians, not under the\nGerman rule. The Germans some \u2014 somehow, you know, they are supposed to be\nunder the Germans, you know, but they were under the Lithuanians. So they working\nseveral days, we were working at that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s rail \u2014 rail somehow is re-established\nthe \u2014 the discipline with \u2014 with a difficulty with my Ukrainian friends. And finally, it\nwas going fr \u2014 really fast, you know, the \u2014 the work was done, some distance from\nPanev\u00e9zys, and that was done, you know, my task was finished, I \u2014 back to the staff,\n165\nOctober 14, 2010\ngave back the rifle, the ammunition, the armband, was done. Went home. My\nparticipation in the second World War was complete, without the \u2014",
        "Q: At that point.",
        "A: Yeah, without point. Let me tell you, at that point \u2014 without \u2014 without \u2014 without\nany shot being fired from my gun, I \u2014 I didn't \u2014 didn\u2019t have any \u2014 no need, no\nopportunity. I wasn\u2019t in any fi-fighting in the action, nothing. So I came back home\nand just was waiting until the Lithuanian army will be reestablished, we will be\nmobilized and we\u2019 ll be sent to fight the \u2014 the Soviets together with the Germans, just\nlike Finns, like Hungarians, Italians, Bulgarians are doing. So that was the big\nillusion, you know, and no \u2014 no Germans didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t want any \u2014 any of our\nservices, and \u2014 of Lithuania\u2019s service. Now, as far as the Jews are concerned, until\nthat, you know, nothing happened except for those p-previ \u2014 early executions. The\nearly executions, of some of the com \u2014 my communist friends, you know, that \u2014 who\nwere in the communist youth organization, fled together with the Soviet army when\nthe Germans approached Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "Q: So you had communi \u2014 you had friends who had been part of the\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, they were from my class, well, what can you do? So, yeah, th-the two of\nthem were killed, you know, there in action, you know, against the German. They\ntried to attack a German tank, and they were killed. But the others retreated together\n166October 14, 2010\nwith the \u2014 some communists with the si \u2014 this communist who lived 1n our house and\nwho was participating 1n executions at the \u2014",
        "Q: Sugar shack.",
        "A: \u2014 sugar factory. And th-those come \u2014 those communist youth people, they \u2014 they\ngot rifles, they were \u2014 had weapons, and they were f-fleeing together with the red\narmy, retreating. The Germans, well, you need map really. The Germans went one\nway from K-Kaunas to Dofilis(ph) in Latvia, Pskov in Russia, directly towards\nSaint Peterburg; Leningrad, at that time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, exactly.",
        "A: But one f\u2014 another was big \u2014 big move from Pilzzeit(ph) to Taurag\u00e9, Siauliai,\n[indecipherable] Riga, and farther away into Estonia. And Panev\u00e9zys is in\nbetween. So they were fleeing toward north, not toward the east. Of course, toward\nthe east the Germans were already advancing there. They fled to \u2014 reached Latvia,\nJ\u00e9kabpils, which is on the Daugava river. And so that on the other side of Daugava\nare \u2014 the German tanks are going. Apparently \u2014 the communists apparently, for\ninstance, this communist who lived in our house, de \u2014 he survived. He \u2014 he e \u2014 he\nescaped.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He escaped, because he later was parachuted into Lithuania, caught by the\nGermans and \u2014 and hanged by the Germans. And so he \u2014 he escaped, but then of\n167October 14, 2010\ncourse was thrown back as a paratrooper. But my f \u2014 but the young friends from the\ncommunist youth thought it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s hopeless. They said that they threw their rifles\ninto the Daugava river, and walked back to Panev\u00e9zys. Well, it took couple of\nweeks, I guess, until they arrived back. Nobody was interested, nobody bothered\nthem, nobody enquired about them, nothing. If they wouldn\u2019t have fled, they would\nhave shot. They would have killed.",
        "Q: They would have been killed.",
        "A: The first \u2014 first day, yeah. Such people like them, they were killed first day, no\nquestions asked. What a difference two weeks made. Nobody was interested, nobody\neven asked them where they were.",
        "Q: Or who they were.",
        "A: Or who they were, yeah. They lived just normal life. One of them\u2019s living in\nKlaip\u00e9da now, raising his family, that\u2019s \u2014 he was Russian, yeah, ethnic Russian.\nYeah, so.",
        "Q: So, you \u2014 you fired not a single shot from your rifle?",
        "A: Not a single shot.",
        "Q: But you said that some who did join this national guard, the Sauliai, you had\nheard that they had been implicated in murders \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and in massacres.\n168October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What is it that you heard, and did you know of these people personally?",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s the problem. I think when they were killing the people, they thought\nthey doing some kind of a heraic \u2014 heroic work. But they very quickly found out\nthat everybody looks very, you know, agains \u2014 ev-everybody\u2019s we \u2014 very much\nagainst that, and they condemned such a t \u2014 such a action. So they didn\u2019t brag about\nthat any more, and so I just heard the rumors, yeah, from my class, about one, yes,\nbut it\u2019s a rumor, he never talked about anything like that, so I\u2014 I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t\naccuse him, because this 1s terrible accusation, and well, he is killed. H-He 1s killed\nby the \u2014 by the s \u2014 by the Soviets, but \u2014 on second occupation, he \u2014 they found his\nremains in ter \u2014 what does \u2014 near Vilnius there, the burial place. But \u2014 but I don\u2019t\nknow. Just a rumor about him.",
        "Q: But when we\u2019re talking about massacres, are we talking about massacres of Jews,\nor are we talking about revenge shooting of communists, some of whom might be\nJewish, some of whom would not be?",
        "A: I imagine that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s killing of the communists.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah. Jews and not Jews. Definitely not Jews, because we know, I mean, who are\nkilled. As far as Jews are concerned, we didn\u2019t have that many people so we identify,\nyou know, how many and where. I sa \u2014 would suspect that the Jews had the worst\n169October 14, 2010\nchance to survive in the \u2014 than the Lithuanian communists. Well, Lithua \u2014 be \u2014 if\nthey decided to kill, I mean, there was no chance any more. You know, they decide,\nthis is a communist, let\u2019s shoot him. And they shot \u2014 shot him. But I think they had\nstupid errors, you know, of killing people who were not communists, could happen\nfor the Jews much easier, because \u2014",
        "Q: Of the suspicion?",
        "A: Sus-Suspicion and not knowing the community that well. In Lithuanian case\npretty much well \u2014 was known who was, you know, wa \u2014 involved that much. So I\nsuspect that maybe more Jews. But anyway, they were not killed, there were not\nmass executions like later. There were not executions of children, women. Well,\nwomen, unless they themselves were implicated, but \u2014 but not like, you know, the\nwhole families or something like that. Just \u2014 just thought he\u2019s a communist, a Jew a\ncommunist, we\u2019ll kill him, kill him. That\u2019s my impression. I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t close to those\nthings, I saw \u2014 well, it\u2019s difficult to say, but it was definitely not \u2014 not a mass ex \u2014\nextermination of the Jews \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 at that point, yet.",
        "Q: At what point did that start? Let\u2019s go \u2014 let\u2019s go to this point [indecipherable]\n170October 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, that\u2019s another story. Since \u2014 you know, it became a pr \u2014 as far as I\nwas concerned, became a quiet time, you know, no \u2014 no \u2014 no service in the \u2014 in the\nmi \u2014 of military or police or anything like that, I through with that.",
        "Q: You\u2019re finished with high school.",
        "A: You're finished with high school. So my friend from my \u2014 from my s \u2014 class,\nasked me to come to the village to be a guest in his sister\u2019s \u2014 sister\u2019s ba \u2014 wedding.\nAnd so we went, I went with \u2014 to my \u2014 near \u2014 near Birzai, his \u2014 his village, and\nthere was a very si\u2014 big wedding, you know, a lot of Birzai beer, which is very\ngood, very, you know, homemade. Fine, so we celebrated there. Now, after that, he\ndecided to show me the Birzai and the \u2014 and the area around, area where he was\nborn and grown and he wanted to show me. Well we went to Birzai, went, met the\ngirls there, was nice. And the last day before I-I came home, we were walking\nthrough his village. There were no buildings around, there were fields and roads, and\nthere came a man on a bicycle. And this man came to a \u2014 both of us and said, do you\nknow? Birzai Jews are \u2014 have been killed. We were shocked, I mean, wha-what \u2014\nwhat do you mean? He didn\u2019t say hello or anything like that, that was the first words\nhe said, do you know?",
        "Q: A total stranger, yes.",
        "A: Total stranger. Do you know the Birzai Jews were killed? No. We were \u2014 we\nwere shocked. And he started telling, he \u2014 he just had to tell that the German\n171October 14, 2010\ncommandant, the German military said \u2014 the Jews were in the ghetto already. He\nsaid that they found, the Germans found that the Jews had hidden weapons, and\nbecause of that, you know, he t \u2014 took all the Jews, and brought to someplace, you\nknow, outside the city, and they just killed all the Jews. All, he said. Children,\nbabies. The German officer was walking around and shooting babies in the mothers\u2019\nhands. Whether he participated or not, I don\u2019t know, but he was shocked. At least he\nwas apparently guarding, or so. He was \u2014 he \u2014 eyewitness. No question about that.",
        "Q: What would have made you think that he might have participated 1n it, or in \u2014\nbeen involved in some way?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I \u2014",
        "Q: But he was an eyewitness, at any rate.",
        "A: He \u2014 well, yeah, he was telling with details everything what was going on. He\nwas telling about the doctor who was not brought to the \u2014 he was so m \u2014 valued that\nthey didn\u2019t bring him to the \u2014 the ghetto, he still stayed at his home and his office.\nAnd the Germans came to pick him up and bring with the other Jews, and he said no,\nhe is not going anywhere. And the \u2014 well, the German officer pulled out the pistol\nand just shot him right there in his office. And thi-this is \u2014 they said, I mean, they\njust put him in \u2014 1n the truck and brought to the execution place and threw in with\nOctober 14, 2010\nthe others. And he \u2014 he described the execution in great detail. He said, the ra \u2014 re \u2014\nGermans were killing, Lithuanians were killing also there, the \u2014 those Jews, you\nknow, and he \u2014 he told him particularly he \u2014 the ch \u2014 the killing of the babies for him\nyou \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 was the thing, I mean, he just couldn\u2019t \u2014 he said, after that, I\nmean, he \u2014 he just resigned from \u2014 from the service, and he doesn\u2019t want even to see.",
        "Q: Was he a policeman?",
        "A: Well, like auxiliary policeman at that time, not a regular in uniform or anything\nlike that, no. Tho-Those are \u2014 were not involved in \u2014 in \u2014 1n usually in \u2014 in Jews\u2019\nexecution. But that was \u2014 we were shocked also, hearing that. And we thought that\u2019s\n\u2014 it\u2019s a unique thing, as I read in Napoleon\u2019s biography right before going there, you\nknow. Th \u2014 having time I just picked up a book and read Napoleon\u2019s biography.\nAnd there is an incident where Napoleon killed the prisoners of war in \u2014 in\nAkah(ph), in \u2014 in \u2014 today Israel, at that time Turkish Palestine. And even, I\nthought, I mean, even \u2014 even Napoleon, whe \u2014 really a reasonable military leader, he\ndid things, and I thought well, BirZai will be also in history like Jaffa, you know,\nsome cruelty which happens during the war, you know, without any reason,\nsomething \u2014 well, what do you mean, I mean Jews were hiding weapons. Maybe\nthey were hiding weapons, but somebody prepared even the ditches for the \u2014 for the\n\u2014 for th \u2014 for them to be killed, you know, before that. So s \u2014 must be just \u2014 just a\npretense. So, we \u2014 we thought that something what\u2019s ha \u2014 what\u2019s happened in\n173October 14, 2010\nBirzai, the \u2014 we \u2014 I went back to Panev\u00e9zys, you know, and then I found out no, this\nthing is going all around. And then we found out not only in Lithuania but in\nLatvia also. Hm. Now \u2014 then we [indecipherable] we saw, in our gymnasium, in\nou-our high school came a German detachment, not the regular military, I don\u2019t\nknow, the uniforms were somewhat different, they have digging equipment a lot, and\nthere was \u2014 they will kill Panev\u00e9zys Jews also, the rumor was there. And of course\nwe believed because we knew what happened in BirZai. It was terrible. By the way,\nI bir \u2014 didn\u2019t mention how the ge \u2014 ghetto was established, fairly early, but not the\nfirst day, not e \u2014 not even the first week. The Germans had all kinds of\nannouncements, and telling what to do, return the weapons, this, that, you know, all\nkinds of things, and u-underneath it was \u2014 my friends said, you know, if \u2014 if it\u2019s not\nwritten [indecipherable], we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll executed \u2014 them \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019ll be shot.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, we\u2019ll shot. Not \u2014 not worth even reading, but if it says we\u2019ll shot, at least\nI read it. But there was another announcement with \u2014 not in German format,\nestablishing a ghetto in Panev\u00e9zys, and requiring to wear this yellow star. Not to\nwalk on the sidewalks, all this thing. I cannot remember, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t remember\nwho signed that, whether it was a Lithuanian mayor, or was a German officer, I\ncannot remember who \u2014 who is \u2014 un-under whose authority was written \u2014 although I\n174October 14, 2010\nknow that in some cases Germans printed, a mayor who didn\u2019t sign.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: But doesn\u2019t matter, but I don\u2019t know in Panev\u00e9zys, under whose authority it was\nannounced. And the ghetto was established. At the beginning, the idea of ghetto\ndidn\u2019t seem such terrible, because we thought about medieval ghettos. Jews living\nseparately, but well, we imagined, you know, we knew that there were ghettos in\nPoland already. We \u2014 we imagined that there \u2014 I mean, the Jews are \u2014 had in there,\ntheir establishments, professionals, you can go there, buy things with th \u2014 from the\nJews. You can go to the doctor, Jewish doctor, you can go to the lawyer. And then\n[indecipherable] they live just separately. So, not that bad. But when the ghetto was\nestablished, it wasn\u2019t the medieval ghetto, it was \u2014 everybody was crowded in, in the\nsmall place, tak \u2014 they didn\u2019t work in their professions, they had to work outside,\nyou know, s-simple some \u2014 digging or something.",
        "Q: Did you see people being moved into the ghetto?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see that. I saw people that were working on \u2014 on the street with the\nyellow \u2014",
        "Q: Star.",
        "A: \u2014 with the yellow star. And that also was \u2014 made a negative impression on the co\n\u2014 the Lithuanian people in Panev\u00e9zys. Tha-That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s too cruel, that\u2019s too cruel.\n175October 14, 2010\nMaybe the Jews did wrong things, maybe they deserved some kind of punishment,\nbut this \u2014 this was too much. And there was a organization, I know, because my\nmother knows her \u2014 he \u2014 she wasn\u2019t pa-part of the organization, but her good friend,\nthis doctor I talked, Dr. Bridges, who talked with the Jewish doctors about, you\nknow, the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation, his wife, and other,\nmostly from Catholic organizations, made a \u2014 a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.\nFirst of all, there was not enough food for them. There was some food, but not\nenough. So thif \u2014 that\u2019s first thing what they get for, you know, to \u2014 to bring food to\nthe ghetto. Ghetto was guarded by Li-Lithuanian au-auxiliaries.",
        "Q: So the same sort of auxiliaries as this man who was on a bicycle from Birzai?",
        "A: Exactly. Exactly the same. But th-they \u2014 they didn\u2019t care. They \u2014 th-they \u2014 they\ncou \u2014 you could bring bread and soda, th-they didn\u2019t want, you know, to \u2014 to bri \u2014\nthey were supposed not to let to [indecipherable] they just didn\u2019t care. And they\nsaid, well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we buy them, you know, some vodka, you know for this\nservice, but \u2014 they didn\u2019t ask for that, but 1t\u2019s \u2014 so \u2014 but th-there were quite many\nJews, and I don\u2019t know, I\u2014 I\u2014TI just doubt very much that everybody got enough\nfood f\u2014 by this smuggling, but \u2014 but some, you know, apparently held, because it\nwas a rather \u2014 a rather ma \u2014 many la \u2014 women were involved in that, so I suppose\nthere was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was senseless. I mean, wa \u2014 it was something which was a-ab\n\u2014 effective to some \u2014 some degree. And then, you know, came that \u2014 that day of\n176October 14, 2010\nexecution. And the rumor went around that tomorrow the Jews will be killed. First of\nall, I heard about that from thos \u2014 these auxiliaries. Some of th-those auxiliaries\ncame to my friends and said, we are not going to kill anybody. We are not killers, we\nare not going to kill anybody. If they force me for such \u2014 into some executions, we\nare going to \u2014 to flee from the service. And they asked my friends, you know,\nwhether we could arrange for them to hide until they could go out of the city toward\ntheir villages, and hide there, but right now where \u2014 when they ha \u2014 when they\nescape from this. So apparently \u2014 by the way, h-here the Bishop of Panev\u00e9zys comes\nin. He also heard those rumors and in one Sunday \u2014 I wasn\u2019t 1n \u2014 in the ch \u2014 in the\nchurch, it\u2019s \u2014 I regret at the time, not a direct witness, but the whole city was talking\nabout that, that the bishop s \u2014 talked about thou sho \u2014 shall not kill, and he really\ncondemned those who\u2019d kill innocent people, and excommunicated them in advance.\nThose who kill innocent people, or you have killed innocent people he\nexcommunicated and \u2014 and condemned them, not by name, because some of them\nthat just didn\u2019t do that yet. But, as a \u2014 as a category of people, of \u2014 of killers. And \u2014",
        "Q: And he was talking about the massacre of the Jews, the ongoing massacre of the\nJews?",
        "A: Yes, and other innocent people, but \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\n177October 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 but he was talking about the Jews. No \u2014 nobody had any doubt, including the\nGermans, because the Germans reacted. They arrested the bishop, put in \u2014 in \u2014 in the\nhouse arrest, and said that he is removed from his \u2014 from his duties, and he has to\nleave Panev\u00e9zys altogether. Okay, so he left Panev\u00e9zys altogether. He had the villa\nin Berciunai, a few kilometers from Panev\u00e9zys, and \u2014 a small resort, and he went to\nhis vil \u2014 to this villa. But he didn't resign from a bishop\u2019s duties, he \u2014 from the villa\nhe just did his old work as a bishop. And Lithuanian administration covered it up,\nyou know. So he \u2014 he was there, you know, and I know \u2014",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Casimiras Paltarokas.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Casimiras Paltarokas. And so \u2014",
        "Q: So did these \u2014 did these auxiliaries who came and asked to be hidden until they\ncould return to their villages, did that succeed? Were they able to run away?",
        "A: No. [asked after this \u2014 this thing, you know, my friends wer \u2014 did they? No, they\nsaid, they didn\u2019t need to. There was no \u2014 no need. There were enough, those who\nwent willingly, and those who refused were left alone, but all of them resigned from\nthe service then, because we have \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to be associated even with this\n\u2014 the killers, the people. So th \u2014 at least in Panev\u00e9zys there was no \u2014 no \u2014 well,\n178October 14, 2010\npressure maybe, but not \u2014 not really something, you know, forcing to participate in \u2014\nin \u2014 in executions.",
        "Q: So, in other words, those Lithuanians who did participate \u2014",
        "A: Did willingly.",
        "Q: \u2014 did it willingly.",
        "A: Apparently yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the conclusion.",
        "Q: And when di \u2014 do you remember what month the executions started, when the\nPanev\u00e9zys Jews were liquidated?",
        "A: I di\u2014I don\u2019t remember now. I have on my \u2014 on my memoirs \u2014",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 or was it in the summer, was it in the early fall?",
        "A: Oh summer, summer. Late summer, I would say. Maybe late August.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So two or three \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, late August, I would say.",
        "Q: So we\u2019re saying June, two or \u2014",
        "A: No, maybe September already. Well, but not \u2014 not \u2014 not later than that. Late \u2014",
        "Q: So two or three months after the Germans have invaded?",
        "A: Less, because half a month June, and July \u2014 yeah, two, two months.",
        "Q: Two months?\n179October 14, 2010",
        "A: About two months, yes. Apparently ki \u2014 1-in other places of Lithuania what I\nread, you know, there were executions of various kinds much earlier. But Panev\u00e9zys\nwas a quiet place, and \u2014 until the Germans took over, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you see \u2014 after those rumors, wasn\u2019t it true that actually the next day that\nhappened, or the few days afterwards it happened \u2014 I mean, in other words, were the\nrumors fulfilled?",
        "A: Which way?",
        "Q: I mean, there \u2014 sometimes one can hear that there are rumors and it doesn\u2019t\nhappen that week, it happens the week after.",
        "A: No, no, it happened that, because it \u2014 there were \u2014 they brought \u2014 they were\ntelling a story, they brought Russian prisoners of war to dig the ditches for that. And\nwhen they gave the dimensions of the ditches, the Russians threw \u2014 threw off their \u2014\ntheir shovels and they refused. Because they were Soviet, people they knew, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s for their \u2014 for execution. And they assumed for them.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And the Germans finally tell them that that\u2019s for Jews, not for you. They didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. They didn\u2019t believe it. They had to take their equipment, whatever, dig the\nditches themselves, or hired sa \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but the Russians wouldn\u2019t do that.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: They were Soviet people, they know what it means to dig a ditch.\n180October 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yeah, you know \u2014",
        "A: They \u2014 yeah, well it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s na \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s terrible, 1t\u2019s terrible. The day\nwhen the executions started was somehow very strange, you know. Nobody was\ntalking, people just didn\u2019t talk. People \u2014 people stopped talking, you know, it was\nkind of \u2014 myself, I went, you know, to s \u2014 visit my friend, who lived near the \u2014 the\nstreet where the road was leading toward Pajuoste where the executions were taking\nplace. And the trucks full of \u2014 of Jews, I suppose, full of people were just going that\ndirection.",
        "Q: Did you see this?",
        "A: Yes. And to his \u2014 with my class friend, we just looked, and didn\u2019t say anything.\nDidn\u2019t say anything because what \u2014 what can you say? What can you say?",
        "Q: So it\u2019s like the whole city knows.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The whole city knows.",
        "A: Oh yeah, the whole city knew, definitely. And the reaction was horrified,\nhorrified. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 whether all of them, of course, maybe o-ob \u2014\nobviously, there should have been people who approved. Af-After all, there were\npeople who participated. But generally, you know, when you go to the city and see\nthe people, you \u2014 you can see that everybody\u2019s kind of like paralyzed from horror,\nwhat\u2019s going on. You ga \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 any revenge, anything about the Jews was\nOctober 14, 2010\nforgotten by that time, long ago. When the Jews were brought into the ghetto, you\nknow, the Lithuanians, th-that \u2014 that was the end. The Lithuanians didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\napprove of that; a ghetto as it was established there, didn\u2019t approve of that, and so \u2014\nbut yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that is a terrible, a terrible thing. Yeah, we \u2014 we went then, after\nthe execution, oh several, several weeks after the execution, and we went to a farm\nwhere one of our friends had the girlfriend 1-in that farm. The farm was nearest farm\nto the execution place. And we wanted to find out. We \u2014 we knew, I mean, it \u2014 it was\na horrible thing happened of a gur \u2014 tremendous significance. Wanted to find out\nwa-wa \u2014 wh-what \u2014 what it was. And they said well, the girl couldn\u2019t tell us anything\nbecause when the executioner cames, the fa \u2014 th-the \u2014 the parents, they say, hid her.\nTold her to go upstairs, you know, and the \u2014 and to hide, and because those \u2014 the\nkillers were going around the co \u2014 the house drinking water, vodka, everything. But\nwe didn\u2019t really, in such a detail as this from BirZai told, there was nothing \u2014\nnothing \u2014 nothing. The same thing, the same Germans and Lithuanians. German\nofficer also killing, you know, babies. Apparently still there\u2019s some resistance of the\nexecutioners to kill babies, so the officer had to take them up on himself. I\u2019m just \u2014 I\nsuppose, that \u2014 that\u2019s my deduction. The story was told that, you know, one\nLithuanian officer was married to a j \u2014 Jewish girl, and when the Jews were brought\nto the ghetto, he went together with her. Lived together with her, and when they\n182October 14, 2010\nbrought to the execution, he went together with her. And he was told, you know, to\ngo out \u2014 go away, you know. He refused, he went with his wife and was killed there.",
        "Q: So you got as close as to the farm next to the execution site?",
        "A: Right, yeah, wa \u2014 the group of us.",
        "Q: The group of us. But you didn\u2019t go to the execution site?",
        "A: Nah, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. Then they said, you know, at the end of the ex-execution it looked like they\nbecame insane. They were drinking vodka, complaining that th-they \u2014 they cannot\nget drunk, you know, no matter how much vodka they drink. And at the end, you\nknow, it was starting g-getting at dusk, you know. And some of them started going \u2014\nthe \u2014 the Jews had to disrobe, they will start going through their \u2014 within they had\nhidden some \u2014 some valuables there, some gold or whatever, some started going\nthrough those \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014 their clothes. And one of them, of the executioners,\none of them said that you\u2019re not supposed to that, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s supposed\nto leave, you know, for the \u2014 for the \u2014 for the \u2014 the Germans, you know, to take care\nof it. So what they did, they just shot him and threw him together with the Jews in\nthe \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in th \u2014 1n the ditch. Now, this is true \u2014 true story, because about\nyear, or \u2014 or couple of years ago, my friend came to me and said, you know \u2014\nwanted to check with me his translation of a request of a mother of those \u2014 that who\n183October 14, 2010\nwas killed there. He was asked \u2014 she was \u2014 wanted to translate into German, was\nasking the German authority to let dig up the grave, find the remains of her son and\nremove it and bring it to \u2014 to its \u2014 a regular cemetery. So, I saw that \u2014 that letter,\nwhich my friend has translated, we looked at the translation. So I \u2014 I doubt very\nmuch a German would have approved that, I don\u2019t know what happened with that\nstory, but apparently that story is right.",
        "Q: So that means the one who was there, who was saying you can\u2019t go through the\nclothes \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 this was his mother.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: How many Jews were there in Panev\u00e9Zys\u2019? Do you know, approximately? Are we\ntalking 10,000, are we talking \u2014",
        "A: No, about s-s 7,000 - 8,000, something less than 10,000 I would say.",
        "Q: And in BirZai, did you have an idea?",
        "A: Less. Considerably less, but I know, because the city is much smaller.",
        "Q: Smaller.",
        "A: But I\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: After this, did you hear of other such massacres throughout the countryside?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah? What did you hear after the Panev\u00e9Zys massacre? How did \u2014 how did the\nnext several days play out? When did people start talking again?",
        "A: Pretty soon, I suppose, but they were still ob-obsessed by that, and were \u2014 really\ncame back to that theme. I was working at that time. I took a wa\u2014a-\u2014ajo-\u2014ajobin\nthe municipality of Panev\u00e9zys. We see Germans introduce the food \u2014 food cards.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We were supposed to get that much food, you know, for \u2014 and the \u2014 this \u2014\neverybody had to get those cards. Now, it\u2019s tremendous operation, you know, every\npeople have to get those cards in Panev\u00e9Zys. Tremendous lines and \u2014 and lots of\ntime. So they hired people, I was one of them, and many of my friends, to bring\nthose to the people. We got those food cards, we had lists of people who live and\nhow many, and we were bringing those cards to the people themselves, so they\nwouldn\u2019t waste time getting those cards. So it was very interesting because I knew\npa \u2014 pa \u2014 got to know Panev\u00e9zys as never before. You know, all kinds of people\nfrom all professions, all \u2014 all social levels, you know, all nationalities, except the\nJews. Except the Jews. Yeah. And so I brought those cards. Most of the people, you\nknow, just signed for it, a-and I go to the next house and so on. But some of the\npeople were talkative. And \u2014 and some \u2014 and all \u2014 not always, but many of the\n185October 14, 2010\npeople were bringing up this \u2014 the execution of the Jews, and all negative. I suppose\nthat those who were for it, wouldn\u2019t start the discussion at all. I just met one who \u2014\nwho was that, you know.",
        "Q: In the bringing of these cards around you mean, or in general you just met one\nperson?",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 let me see, did I bring a\u2014 a cards? Exactly thinking, I think I\nwas bringing the cards, but he was outside, or he was visiting that fa-family, and I\ndidn\u2019t give him the cards, just the regular \u2014 the residents. And I don\u2019t know, he was\nofficer in Lithuanian army or \u2014 or what, I don\u2019t remember his \u2014 his profession, but\nhe said that his \u2014 he was one of those, when the deportations started who \u2014 who ran\naway to hide because he thought th-they are coming for him. And his family was\ndeported. He \u2014 hi-his wife and two daughters. And he was convinced that the Jews\nwere in that group, and he said he is going to \u2014 to participate in killing of the Jews.\nBut I doubt very much, because he was telling when the Jews in Panev\u00e9zys were\nalready killed, so he had to go to Vilnius or Kaunas, you know, where the\nexecutioners were still working. I doubt very much whether he did that, but I don\u2019t\nknow, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But his sentiment was there. In other words, he had that \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 he had that sentiment.\n186October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right. But that was the only one, and I sup-suppose there were more than that,\nbut I \u2014 but I\u2014 I\u2014I would imagine that they wouldn\u2019t start that type of conversation.",
        "Q: And yet, with the people that \u2014 who you did have start such conversations, they\nwere still in some shock?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And th-that\u2019s why they brought up the subject, they just \u2014 just\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t hold, they just wanted to \u2014 to \u2014 to speak about it.",
        "Q: So all this happened in the first several months after the German invasion?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And after the German occupation, and we have another three years, or another\ntwo and a half years of \u2014 of German occupation, Nazi occupation of Lithuania.\nAnything in those next couple of years occur that was also related to the Holocaust,\nto the Jewish community, that you came across in your life at that time, or was it\npretty much over by the fall of 1941?",
        "A: In Panev\u00e9zys was over, because no Jews were left, unless somebody hid some of\nthe Jews, which happened, as we found out later. At that time nobody w-was\nbragging about it. So \u2014 but I went to Vilnius, to study in Vilnius and there were\nghetto.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, there was a ghetto there.",
        "A: Ghetto there, really two of them at the beginning. And yeah, but it was so\nisolated, and was at \u2014 the wall, they were really under the wall there, s-so they were\n187October 14, 2010\nso isolated that we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in there. We knew that it \u2014 we saw\nsome of the Jews being driven to some kind of work. We knew they were, some of\nthem, working in the factories, one factory came up in flames because it seems\n[indecipherable] there sabotage, because they were working for the German army,\nfor the \u2014 getting the cur \u2014 th-the furs, you know, for the winter.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, so Kailis factory. So, but we d \u2014 we knew that executions were going on in\nPaneriai. From time to time they were taking out there and \u2014 and being killed. We\nknew that some of the Jews escaped. Escaped \u2014 not only those which were hidden,\nbut escaped into the forests in vil \u2014 in Vilnius area and in Kaunas area, I don\u2019t know\nin other ci-cities. And there joined the Soviet guerillas, Soviet partisans, which the\nmovement, at that time, you know, th-the \u2014 the Soviet planes were parachuting some\nof leaders and weapons. And th-there was that movement of the Soviet partisans, es-\nescaped prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war escaped. Some of the Lithuanian\ncommunists wer \u2014 survived, and the Jews who escaped from the ghettos. Now, at\nthat time there was Lithuanian resistance movement against the Germans, there was\nunderground press going out, letters, and even at that time I noticed one thing. That\nour press, underground press was reporting what the ger \u2014 Germans were doing with\nthe Jews. If they killed, you know, thousand or s \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or so Jews in\nKaunas, there was a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014a notice, a report. There were reports about Jewish\n188October 14, 2010\nguerillas, the Soviet guerillas, but there was no judgment. And even speaking with\nthe people, they didn\u2019t, most of the pe \u2014 they didn\u2019t speak about those things, but if\nthere was \u2014 they spoke about the Jewish guerillas, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t meet anybody who\nwould condemn them. At that time it was clear that they were fighting, that was the\nonly chance to fight for their life. So, ba \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 nobody see how \u2014 how you\ncan condemn them. They were on the other side, they were enemies. Our Lithuanian\ns-security forces, auxiliaries were fighting against go \u2014 Soviet guerillas, also against\nthe Jewish Soviet guerillas, but not because they\u2019re Jew, because they were fighting\nagainst the Soviets. Well, that was, the war was going on, Lithuanians were fighting\nPolish guerillas also. But there were no \u2014 there was not \u2014 not that, as a div \u2014 during\nthe first occupation, where there was that resentment. There was no resentment.\nThey were on the other side, they were like \u2014 like enemy, which you do not\ncondemn, you know, he \u2014 I fight for one cause, he is fighting for another.",
        "Q: What were you studying in Vilnius?",
        "A: Law.",
        "Q: Law.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And did the name Jakub Gens mean anything to you then, did you know of him?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.\n189October 14, 2010",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Did you know of the Lithuanian security chiefs at the time in Vilnius, Lileikis,\nGimzauskas, did those names mean anything to you then?",
        "A: No, but my \u2014 one of my friends, who studied together with us in my class, he was\nworking in Lithuanian security under the Germans, and \u2014 and a-as an officer. He was\nstudying and working in the city already. But his job was in particular, against the\nPolish underground. He was well \u2014 and he was killed by the Polish underground\nwhen he was trying to arrest somebody or something like that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I knew him very well.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And did he have anything to say about the workings there, or was he\npretty quiet about it?",
        "A: He was kind of quiet, yeah, generally he was a quiet man. But no-nothing \u2014 but as\nfar as I know he had nothing to do with the Jews, but I can\u2019t be sure. I can\u2019t be sure,\nbut really against the Poles, and still continued that hostility. Doesn\u2019t matter, you\nknow, because the German occupation, but Lithuanians were still fighting the Jew \u2014\nthe Jew \u2014 the Polish, and the Polish Lithuanian, fighting Lithuanians.",
        "Q: Yeah, the \u2014",
        "A: E-E-Even at that time.\n190October 14, 2010",
        "Q: If there \u2014 1s there anything else that you would like to add to events that touched \u2014\nthat again, you heard of, or were inv \u2014 or were involved in, in a sense of \u2014 of being\nin a certain place when something happens, about the Jews during the German\noccupation?",
        "A: About the Jews during the German occupation?",
        "Q: Yeah. Since you were in Panev\u00e9zys and you were in Vilnius \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u20141s there any other memory, any other event or instance in those two and a half,\nthree years?",
        "A: No, not really, except that, you know, in Vilnius I-I was a student, and between\nthe students and \u2014 and some wa \u2014 in the higher class, were definitely condemn \u2014\nwith old \u2014 the opinion was condemning those who had participated in executions,\nand even at that time were participating, because more or less, killing of the Jews in\nPaneriai \u2014 Austai(ph) Paneriai took place all the time, sometimes less, sometimes\nmore and the killers were working all the time. Of course, killers were killing not\nonly the Jews, they were killing also the Poles, and well, Lithuanians, Germans\nkilled themselves. But th-they killed them also.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, the Lahavichos(ph) \u2014 it was territorial defense organization, which\nGeneral Lahavichos(ph) organized with the agreement with Germans, but later, you\nOctober 14, 2010\nknow, fell out. Germans arrested him and disarmed that defense force and killed, you\nknow, hundreds of \u2014 of his soldiers. And then the, you know, Lithuanians from the\neast Prussia, not from Klaip\u00e9dos, but even farther, Tilz\u00e9 and all that, they f \u2014 they\nwere, you know, fled from Nazis to Lithuania in Vilnius, they arrested and\nexecuted them in Austai(ph) Paneriai also.",
        "Q: And the reason was because of activities, or because of \u2014",
        "A: Oh, activities, they were pu-publishing in Lithuanian newspaper, Lithuanian\nbooks. Well, of course, that was all over, because they had to flee from the Nazis and\nthey came to Lithuania. And \u2014 but the tils \u2014 Tilz\u00e9s \u2014 Tilz\u00e9s \u2014 Tilszin(ph) Gestapo\nstill had, you know, get in \u2014 in th \u2014 1n their \u2014 in \u2014 in their plans, and as far \u2014 as soon\nas Germans occupied Lithuania into Vilnius and they came from Tilz\u00e9, they just\ntook them out and executed the whole two families there. So \u2014",
        "Q: How \u2014Is\u2014I have a sense that we\u2019re gon \u2014 coming close to the end of our story.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How did things end with you in Lithuania? What happened with your family?\nWhat happened in 1944 as the war was turning? Bring us up to date as how you\ncame to live in the United States.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I should go through \u2014 through small detail, but\nafter university was closed \u2014 the Germans closed the university. Well, first of all, the\nGermans, after Stalingrad, which was in \u2014\n192October 14, 2010",
        "Q: 1943.",
        "A: \u2014 1943, which was another turning point, I was very much aware, and most of the\npeople were aware that this a turning point. After Stalingrad we thought maybe, you\nknow, there might be somebody if \u2014 if the Germans throw the Hitler away, or\nsomething may \u2014 some \u2014 but most likely Germans have lost the war. So, Germans\nalso realized that they are in bad shape now. So they decided oh, Lithuanians wanted\nto fight against the Soviets, okay, so let\u2019s call Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians,\nthey established Waffen SS legions for those countries and drafted the young men\ninto those Waffen SS legion. Estonian [indecipherable] legion, and Latvian, two\ndivisions. Estonian, one division, Latvian, two divisions. And Lithuanian,\nLithuanians just boycotted. Nobody really, excepts few invalids reported to the\ninduction center. Well, they became so angry, they closed the universities, because\nthey realized that the students were behind it, and they arrested the \u2014 you know, s \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, about 50, maybe less people very known in Lithuania. P-Priests,\nprofessors, even their administrators who worked on that dam, high administrators\nand brought them to the concentration camp in Stutthof, near Danzig. And all the\nother oppressions, you know, your \u2014 even \u2014 even \u2014 even farmers and so al-al-also.\nSo, once that started \u2014 well, I d\u2014I don\u2019t want to go into lo \u2014 long details, but I \u2014 I\nwa \u2014 I became sick with a pneumonia and was in the hospital and I was discharged\nfor pneumonia. And the Germans took a list of discharged people and drafted us.\n193October 14, 2010\nAnd I saw that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really a sad situation. So I thought that the only thing I have,\nif I don\u2019t want, you know, that my family will suffer [indecipherable] for that, I \u2014 I\nwould rather collec \u2014 select, you know, where do I am going under the Germans.\nAnd I selected so-called Reichsarbeitsdienst. A Reichs labor service, which all the\nGermans had to \u2014 to go through before going into the military service, but also the\ngirls had to go through that. So I w \u2014I volunteered for that, not wanting to go\nanywhere else. My resistance leader approved of that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He himself was part German, and apparently thought that that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s\nadvantageous to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to be on that side [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you were an anti-German resistance \u2014",
        "A: I was.",
        "Q: \u2014 as an anti-Nazi resistance [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, right, yes. So my leader acce \u2014 a-approved of that, and I went into the\narbeitsdienst. I served for, not the full term. I don\u2019t know why, they let us go\nearlier. And we came to Lithuania. We knew that, you know, the German \u2014",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. You weren\u2019t in Lithuania at that\npoint?",
        "A: No, we went to Germany.",
        "Q: I see.\n194October 14, 2010",
        "A: We \u2014 we work in Peenemiinde, we were in several places, but I\n[indecipherable] in Peenemiinde where the German rockets were being built, you\nknow [indecipherable] and \u2014 and the other. And Mr. Brown was there, you know, I\n\u2014 we saw him.",
        "Q: You did? You saw him?",
        "A: Y-Yeah, well, just fleeing, you know, he was walking through there. So, was \u2014\nwas \u2014 German were very correct about that. Apparently they wanted to create some\nfriendly people for them, you know. Was \u2014 was no-not bad at all. And the Germans\nwo \u2014 took \u2014 but we were working together with the Germans, mixed together with\nthe Germans, and they were young boys, but friendly. So, was not a bad experience.\nWa-\u2014 one \u2014 bu-but then we were released from that service earlier, before our term\nwas over, because there was supposed to be Lithuanian army, you know, armed\nforces be \u2014 being established, and the general said that he needs some experienced\nsoldiers who could be un \u2014 you know, non-commissioned off \u2014 officers, something\nlike that.",
        "Q: Which general, what was his name?",
        "A: Lahavichos(ph).",
        "Q: Lahavichos(ph) okay, him, okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, and \u2014 an-and so I \u2014 I went back, you know, was discharged and s \u2014 joined\nLahavichos(ph) army. But that was a short thing, you know, couple months until\n195October 14, 2010\nGermans, you know, came in conflict with Lahavichos(ph) for many aspects. They\ndi \u2014 didn\u2019t hold with their agreements. Lahavichos(ph) was a very strong, a very s-\nstubborn and proud man. We loved him, all the soldiers loved him, he was a real\nleader. So the Germans arrested him, his staff, as I said, and disbanded this \u2014 this\nunit and executed some of them. We were let go earlier, so I lived in my aunt\u2019s\nhouse in \u2014 in the village. And then the Russians approached Lithuania, pretty soon\nthey took Vilnius, was a-approaching Kaunas and I decided, you know, that I\u2014 I\u2019m\nnot going to wait for them. Some who mo \u2014 my friends ask me to, you know, join\nthem as guerrilla fighters against the Soviets. I didn\u2019t believe in that, I thought\nmaybe two, three months, not more, you know. I didn\u2019t believe that the west will\nfight for Lithuania. I decided I go west, and try, you know, to \u2014 to meet it, the\nwestern English, or Americans in Germany, because this was obvious Germany\nlost the war, that was clear.",
        "Q: Did your parents go with you?",
        "A: No. My mother wanted to go with me, well there was confusion, a lot of\nconfusion. And my pa \u2014 father wanted, you know, he was too late. Panev\u00e9zys was\ntaking without any \u2014 any ba-battle. Germans just demolished electrical plant and\nretreated without any ac \u2014 without any resistance. So my father stayed in Lithuania.\nMy mother eventually went to Germany also, but separately form \u2014 from myself. I\n196October 14, 2010\nwent to Germany, also, we met at the end of war. I met my mother in Munich, and\nwell, I must tell y \u2014 if I tell the full story, so I went to the east Prussia.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: We were sent to work together with the farmers, to \u2014 to help the farmers.\nApparently, also, before the evacuation, 1t was clear that the Russians will go in \u2014\ninside. So we were working at the farm, and then suddenly was told everybody has\nto go to dig ditches against the tanks, to make obstacles to the Soviet tanks coming\nin. And a lot of Lithuanians, Poles, everything, you know, were brought together,\nand who were just digging those anti-tank ditches. Which didn\u2019t help any,\napparently, later. We were in \u2014 in the \u2014 in the rather famous \u2014 we later fa \u2014 became\nfamous in the \u2014 or infamous really. A village nomar -- Nemmersdorf \u2014",
        "Q: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well, yeah, what \u2014 Soviets e-e-executed a lot of Germans. All of them, really,\nwho were left there, so \u2014 who were digging those \u2014 those anti-tank ditches. Now, one\nafternoon, you know, after \u2014 after lunch, we were \u2014 a break, you know, were eating\nour lunch and suddenly we noticed that SS troopers have surrounded us all around.\nAnd they took out their automatic weapons and one of them came forward. And in\nvery good Lithuanian language, very good, with no accent, nothing, said that we\nLithuanians are all communists, we should be shot right away. We didn\u2019t fight to\ndefend our own country, and we deserve to die row \u2014 right here and now. But, the\n197October 14, 2010\nfuehrer is so great in \u2014 in his \u2014 you know, that he decided to let us \u2014 to \u2014 I mean, to\nw-wer \u2014 to fight f \u2014 for the Germany in this way, you know, of our \u2014 our shame,\nthat we didn\u2019t defend our country, that we are basically communists at heart, who let\nus, you know, wer \u2014 you know \u2014 well, anyway, to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to parole us\nfrom this.",
        "Q: Expiate \u2014 expiate your sin \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 1n other words.",
        "A: Expiate my sin. So, and this \u2014 so. we will be drafted now in the German army as\nauxiliaries in the Luftwaffe. And wh-who doesn\u2019t, you know, doesn\u2019t appreciate\nfuehrer\u2019s great move, you know, well, we will know about that, how to handle it.\nOkay, so \u2014 so we became German soldiers. Soldiers, no, auxiliaries. No rank,\nnothing like that. They [indecipherable] gave us uniforms, but without any rank\nindications, any insignia, and we were aus \u2014 auxiliaries. We were supposed to do\nwork, we were digging trenches against the sw \u2014 Swedes in Stralsund in Germany.\nStralsund because the Germans at that time thought that Sweden\u2019s will \u2014 going to\njoin the allies and attack them in the north. So we were digging those trenches after\nthat, you know, the Swedes didn\u2019t attack, so they brought us as other tasks. But they\nwere manual tasks, and electrical work, you know, something like that. I don\u2019t know\nwhether to tell the story, I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 because \u2014 are we running out of time?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "Q: Yeah, we\u2019ve only got about a minute left on this tape, actually. Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, well \u2014 well, anyways, well after the war, I met my \u2014 my mother. I didn\u2019t go\ninto the prisoner of war, I just deserted from the Germans. I didn\u2019t feel that I owe\nthem anything. And we lived in Germany, | studied in the University of Tubingen,\nstudied law again. And then, you know, my uncle, my mother\u2019s brother brought us to\nthe United States, so \u2014",
        "Q: And your profession after the war, can you tell us?",
        "A: After the war, I had various jobs, the bo \u2014 the first \u2014 the first job I had was a\nmanual job, polishing \u2014 buffing the metal.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Brushing \u2014 buffing the lipstick casings. So th-that was work. It was di-dirty work.\nThen I worked in textile, and after I st-studied here and completed my studies in\nUniversity of Connecticut, I \u2014 and then in New York University Business School,\nthen I worked for the government. I worked in the postal service as an economist,\nmaking analyses of new equipment, of new buildings, economic analyses in that\nfield, and worked until I retired. And after that, a short time, I worked in Lithuanian\nmission at the United Nations, when Lithuania became independent. They didn\u2019t\nhave any diplomats, and Mr. Simutas(ph), who was appointed ambassador at the\nUnited Nations, asked me to join his staff.\n199\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "Q: Did you feel that \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. Excuse me that I interrupted. Did you feel that kind of international\nhorizon as you were growing up in your family, that your father had such a\u2014 such a\nworld view? Or would you say there wouldn\u2019t really be such a connection from\nwhen you \u2014 because this is all before you were born.",
        "Q: So, he spoke all those languages?",
        "Q: And you?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. So we \u2014 you could say he spoke four languages; Lithuanian, Russian,\nPolish and German.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Tell \u2014",
        "Q: She spoke Lithuanian only?",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did this make a difference in your family as you were growing up, that your\nmother had not had the same opportunities, and so the same ability to \u2014 to grow\nintellectually as your father had had? Did they have \u2014 yeah, did that make a\ndifference between them in how they understood things?",
        "Q: In what way \u2014 how were they advanced? What would you mean \u2014 mean by that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The lawyer\u2019s name was?",

        "Q: I see, and fri \u2014 did your father have siblings?",
        "Q: They were both farmers?",
        "Q: And what was your father\u2019s profession in Taurag\u00e9 where you were born? What\nwas he doing there when you were born?",

        "Q: \u2014 in \u2014 afterwards, it\u2019s an interesting thing that as a new country, did Lithuania\nadopt the old Russian Imperial legal system, and that\u2019s why it would have been\nuseful?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, what are your earliest memories?",
        "Q: Okay, what do you remember? Do you \u2014 what do you remember? In your mind\u2019s\neye, when you go back to being a child, what are \u2014 what are the images that you see?",

        "Q: Until how old?",
        "Q: Would this \u2014 excuse me, this would have been middle school? At age 10 would\nyou have been joining high school, or would have been later \u2014",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "Q: What made it sophisticated?",
        "Q: Did it \u2014 this re \u2014 leads me to a question I was also thinking about. As you were\ngrowing up, your very earliest years, did you sense that there were others in\nTaurag\u00e9 who were not Lithuanian? Did you \u2014 you know, did you know of other\nnationalities, other groups of people, and \u2014 who made up the population of\nTaurage?",
        "Q: Were there Germans?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Were there Poles in Taurag\u00e9?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: So the population would have been made up of these \u2014 were there any Russians in\nTaurage?",
        "Q: So you would hav \u2014 1-1f I were to describe Taurag\u00e9 at the time when you were\nborn and the first 10 years of your life, was a city that was made up of Lithuanians of\nboth Catholic and Lutheran religion \u2014 religious affiliations \u2014",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You said that Taurag\u00e9 was sophisticated in \u2014 a great deal because there was a\nGerman influence \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 very close by. It would have been probably what was Prussia, no \u2014 you know\nthat \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 for more than most part of \u2014",
        "Q: And that there were friendly relations. But if I \u2014 if I try to kind of follow the\ndates, you say you were born in 1923.",
        "Q: You lived there until you were 10 years old, so that would have been \u2014",

        "Q: 1933 is when the Nazis come to power in Berlin.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and you were 10 years old, so maybe it\u2019s unfair to ask, but I will ask\nanyway, did you \u2014 do you think something changed after the Nazis came to power in\n\u00b033, with German relations in the town, in Taurag\u00e9 and in the region in general, was\nthere any friction that developed, was there any \u2014 anything that changed in that? Did\nit \u2014 you think it had an influence at all?",

        "Q: How much of this would have been in the atmosphere, how much would it have\nbeen talked about?",
        "Q: A lot?",
        "Q: Do you remember such discussions taking place?",
        "Q: And what year was this? Just to establish what we\u2019re talking about.",

        "Q: It can be both subtle, and it can be very simple.",
        "Q: And wa \u2014 were there \u2014 how would you characterize these discussions? Were they\nof real interpretation of what the Bible was and what the Torah was, or were they\nmore sort of the kind of, you know, a more simple interpretations?",

        "Q: Uh-huh. The \u2014 and in \u2014 can you repeat just a little bit, if 1t would be \u2014 or \u2014 or\nexplain just a little bit, what\u2019s the essence, it was a \u2014 was it th-the takeover of\nVilnius that was the reason why there was this friction, or was there something more\nto it, was it a broader, deeper, longer lasting \u2014",

        "Q: What happened?",
        "Q: Which it hadn\u2019t had until \u2014",

        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Why do you think that they even \u2014 1938 would have been motivated by it?",
        "Q: So this was the \u2014 this was how it was perceived basically, in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys, in\nLithuania?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I just drew a blank. I think maybe we should change tape here. Okay.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mr. Algimantas Gureckas on October 14\", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, I\nwanted to continue our \u2014 our discussion about \u2014 about the rising tensions in \u2014 in your\nworld, in Panev\u00e9zys, in Lithuania. And we were talking about the Polish\nLithuanian relationship. As you\u2019re speaking, I\u2019m thinking, how much of this did a 15\nyear old boy know, because that\u2019s how old you were in 1938; how much of this was\ndiscussed at home? How much do you \u2014 can you remember that you knew of it at the\ntime?",
        "Q: I want to also kind of make a remark is, as I\u2019m listening to you, you\u2019re saying that\nthese events, which are political \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 in nature, which are intra-governmental, nevertheless affected your family a\ngreat deal, and I take it to mean affected in a sense of not in a personal way that their\nlives changed from one day to the next.",
        "Q: But their feelings, their \u2014 their s \u2014 their senses and so on were affect \u2014 and that\nspeaks to me of \u2014 of people who were engaged in a civic process.",
        "Q: Because there could have been people who live in a country, as there are today in\nthe United States, and as there are all over the world \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 who \u2014 whose world consists of, I go to work in the morning, I do my job, I\ncome home, I have no interest in \u2014 in politics, or in what goes around me. I can\u2019t\naffect it anyway, and what happens in Washington, what happens in Moscow, is\nnone of my affair, okay? And clearly that was not the dynamic going on in the cir \u2014\nin the \u2014 in the circle of people that you grew up with. Is that so?",
        "Q: And why would you \u2014 how would you explain their engagement then? How\nwould you explain their engagement to events that really are outside and beyond\ntheir personal lives? By that \u2014 still at that point, I mean at some point history doesn\u2019t\nim-impact, but how would you explain this interest?",
        "Q: I\u2019m asking not so much about that particular relationship, but in \u2014 in a\u2014 I guess\nmore direct way would say, why should your parents care what goes on between\nKaunas and Warsaw, or Kaunas and Moscow, or Kaunas and Berlin? It\u2019s ha \u2014\nyou know, what made your family engaged in caring about these political events, in\ngeneral. Why would you \u2014 how would you explain it?",
        "Q: Idea.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: The other question that comes to mind, and again this 1s in \u2014 in my mind an trony\nbecause I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not as familiar with the history at the time, 1s why would\nPoland be someone you\u2019d be \u2014 there would be more of such negative feelings about\nthan the Soviet Union, which is right next door? What \u2014 well, so is Poland, but \u2014",
        "Q: All along?",
        "Q: You read that in the Lithuanian media?",
        "Q: And did news of the famine in the Ukraine, was there anything like that that \u2014\nthat touched your \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: In the 30s, as this was \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So \u2014 so in other words, from what I get \u2014 a sense I get from you 1s\nthe Soviet Russia, or Soviet Union was rather benign in it \u2014 in a\u2014ina-\u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: The right one.",
        "Q: So, what happens after 1938? We\u2019re finished with Poland. Poland requires this\nultimatums \u2014 says this ultimatum, requires diplomatic relations. Everybody\u2019s upset,\nbut they acquiesce.",
        "Q: What happens then?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And?",
        "Q: Misetas(ph) company.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, so wa \u2014 so it was still sort of separate communities, it was not an integrated\nsense of these are all Lithuanian citizens, but it was more, each takes care of its own.",
        "Q: It just happens naturally like that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And who was this girl who came from Klaip\u00e9da? Did you talk to her?",
        "Q: Did she tell you about what had been going on there, and what she saw, and\nthings like that?",
        "Q: What did she say?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were there any people that you knew of in Lithuania who were Lithuanians who\nsupported Hitler? Who thought that the 1 \u2014 that the ideology of the Nazi party was\none that had some positive attributes?",
        "Q: Okay. What \u2014 and you were, by that point, 16 years old?",
        "Q: And how \u2014 is your life changing at all? I mean, your personal life, do things keep\non going the way they should be, even in spite of these \u2014",
        "Q: What happened next, that you remember?",
        "Q: There was a \u2014 there was a \u2014 still a city gate in 1939?",
        "Q: AuSros Vartai means in English, Gates of Dawn, yes?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Did they have their own schools, though, Lithuanian language schools in Poland,\nor \u2014 or you don\u2019t know about that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So in some ways this 1939 summer excursion is both an \u2014 something new,\nbecause you get to see the city for the first time in your life.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a summer vacation, and it\u2019s positive.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something that you see of \u2014 that you can relate to and identify with.\nAnd at the same time it\u2019s the summer of 1939.",
        "Q: Which is not exactly a summer without tension.",
        "Q: How did you feel it in Vilnius?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: To you?",
        "Q: And Panev\u00e9zys is two hours away.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Well, this is somewhat of what I was getting at earlier, is that, you know, some\npeople say wa \u2014 some people will say, there\u2019s all this high politics going on.",
        "Q: How does it touch me, a simple person?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. So this is where you started to feel that there\u2019s something going on, in \u2014\nwhen you went on this summer excursion to Vilnius?",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "Q: Also, before then \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you had e \u2014 you had \u2014 before then, you hadn\u2019t necessarily been convinced of\nthis argument.",
        "Q: But at that point, once you went there and you saw these signs, that these were \u2014\nthat there was so much that was of Lithuanian \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 history there, and Lithuanian presence there, that yes, it is \u2014 it is the rightful\ncapital.",
        "Q: Okay. You go back to Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "Q: What happens after that? You know, there\u2019s the summer, and then September\nfirst comes. September first is not that long after your summer \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 excursion. So, how did events play out? What happened back in Panev\u00e9zys,\nonce you returned from the trip?",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "Q: You were pretty much the hero.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s not bad.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what was the militor \u2014 Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement?",
        "Q: Who were these countries?",
        "Q: So are these discussions, you know, I \u2014 it still is hard for me to imagine that a 16\n\u2014 by now 16 year old boy \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 1s thinking like this at that time. What I can imagine 1s that a 16 year old boy is\nlistening to grown-ups talk like this at that time.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So when you her \u2014 hear, a week from school \u2014 before school starts, that there is\nthis Molotov-Ribbentrop pact \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and you \u2014 you go to, where was it, your school area, even though it hadn\u2019t\nbegun, 1s this where you learned of it?",
        "Q: From your friends.",
        "Q: Your friends. And your friends are your same a \u2014 they \u2014 about the same age?",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: It\u2019s a week before September first.",
        "Q: And then what happens?",
        "Q: Was there any sentiment of changing, I mean any voices amongst Lithuanians\nthat said well, maybe we didn\u2019t like the Poles very much for what they did, but my\nGod, what\u2019s happening in Poland, and it\u2019s terrible? Was that \u2014 was there any\nsympathy being expressed in the so \u2014 in those circles that you were in, of Poland\u2019s\ngetting it now, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not easy?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Overreaching themselves?",
        "Q: Would you say, you know, would you say your family belonged to a particular\nkind of political wing in Lithuania, or was it fairly typical of, let\u2019s say the mood in\nsociety? From what I understand there was a Christian democrat, and a more\nnationalist, or national political forces.",
        "Q: Which one would your family would have \u2014 thought they would have identified\nwith more?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So they were much more of a \u2014 of \u2014 from the national \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Would you have called them nationalists?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: And yet \u2014 and yet, there was temptation \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 that \u2014 that this \u2014 this, let\u2019s say encouragement, on behalf of the Nazis to then\ntake Vilnius \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 was tempting. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t something that was dismissed as we just\ndon\u2019t do that, unless fa \u2014 is \u2014 until Smetona said so.",
        "Q: Conflict.",
        "Q: Okay. So \u2014 so the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is \u2014 is \u2014what you hear of is between\nnon-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what becomes [indecipherable]",

Mr. Gureckas, where\nwe left off, you were describing to us how you saw the downed Soviet plane which\nhad fought \u2014 which was flying against \u2014 in the Finnish \u2014 the Winter War against\nFinland, how it landed near Panev\u00e9zys, and you saw the dismantled parts of it being\ntaken by Soviet soldiers, and it aroused a great deal of curiosity amongst the \u2014 the\nkids in school, and you all went to the windows to take a look. I wanted to ask a\nquestion about, let\u2019s say, how kids felt then when these events were happening. And\nbring it back to the very beginning of tensions. Did you, as \u2014 as young students have\nan urge to do something, whether it was against the Germans, or against the Poles, or\nagainst the Soviets, to defend your country? Were there any such student types of\ndiscussions or ideas going on, or even actions that were taken?",
        "Q: Did you tell your father?",
        "Q: Wanted to fight.",
        "Q: To check the girls\u2019 bags.",

        "Q: \u2014 but we\u2019re getting a little ahead of ourselves chronologically.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back to October, when the bases appear, yo-you hear the news, the\nMolotov-Ribbentrop pact, the bases appear, the plane is down, you see the \u2014 the\nparts going on. How did life change after that? How di \u2014 did it \u2014 did you feel it\nimpact you in any way when those bases first arrived?",
        "Q: Life hadn\u2019t changed much.",

        "Q: What does the occupation mean in this ken \u2014 in this sense? You have bases, but\nhow does that change to occupation?",
        "Q: Do you remember that conversation?",
        "Q: Where were you at the time?",

        "Q: Do you remember their name?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So when you s \u2014 okay, when you saw this demonstration, what \u2014 do you\nremember what your feelings were at the time?",
        "Q: I was afraid. I was afraid that the revolution is going on, from what I heard what\nhappened in Russia, you know, with all the cruelties of the revolution might happen\nright \u2014 right here, right now, you know, in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys. They decided \u2014 they\ndecided that they sh \u2014 you know, they should go and disperse the police, this \u2014 the\nfash \u2014 fascist police, as they said. And they \u2014 they march with their red flag, they\nmarch toward police, I didn\u2019t follow them, and I f\u2014 later find out that the Lithuanian\nmilitary officer in Panev\u00e9zys telephoned the Soviet forces, whichever the\ncommander was in Panev\u00e9zys, and asks whether, you know, that\u2019s supposed what\u2019s\n\u2014 what should happen, because they were trying to \u2014 to disperse the police, you\nknow, and take the police headquarters in Panev\u00e9zys. And the Soviet commander\nsaid no, no demonstrations, nothing is allowed, and if you don\u2019t \u2014 if you don\u2019t\nprotect the quiet in \u2014 in the city, we will have to take care of it and provide this \u2014 this\n\u2014 so th-there would be no d \u2014 no demonstrations, nothing. So then, you know, h-he\nco \u2014 the c \u2014 the commandant, the Lithuanian officer called Sauliai, and we were also\ncalled, I \u2014 oh, we went to the Sauliai headquarters, we have given rifles, and we\nwere supposed \u2014 there was \u2014 commandant\u2019s hour, was supposed to enforce that, to\npatrol the streets, and see that nobody walks during the nighttime, which we \u2014",
        "Q: And you did that?",
        "Q: Did you, first of all, did you recognize anybody? Within that demonstration was\nthere anybody you personally knew or recognized?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: And did you know of Lithuanian communists? Not Jewish communists, but\nLithuanian communists, who either would be there, or who had been in somehow or\nother known, or active?",
        "Q: Did anything \u2014 do you know what happened to him when this \u2014 there was the fo \u2014\nthe Soviet occupation? Did his [indecipherable] change?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: I want to go back again to that demonstration. You said you were scared. Did you\nhave any view of \u2014 did you have any \u2014 any thoughts about the demonstrators? You\nknow, why they were demonstrating? Were you surprised to see it? Were you \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, so you dispersed, and it went away, and it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something that\nstayed.",
        "Q: Okay, so now it\u2019s occupied, there is no more Lithuanian government, the\npresident has left. What else happened, what else changed?",
        "Q: More of them?",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 I mean, from your story I get a sense that there was this \u2014 that\nthere was a benign feeling for most of the independence years about the Soviet\nUnion.",
        "Q: That when there was the Finno-Russian war, then you were on the side of the\nFinns because you know, they were the weaker, or the \u2014 1t was their territory that\nwas being attacked, and so it was more that you were on their side than the Soviet\nside. But when did it stop being a benign feeling? When did it start being a\nthreatening feeling? One where you\u2019re \u2014 where you\u2019re saying, these are our\nenemies? When did that \u2014 when did that change [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, so that\u2019s October, 1939.",
        "Q: And then in June 1940 there\u2019s a full occupation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And why were you, you know, slightly more inclined toward \u2014 if \u2014 of \u2014 of the\ntwo evils, the German one would be the lesser?",
        "Q: Okay. So it \u2014",
        "Q: The pro \u2014 there was, or there was not propaganda?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So when they actually occupied \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 then that changed? Then they cared that you believed it?",
        "Q: Show me \u2014 explain to me how this threat made itself felt. Even \u2014 you know, you\nhave a\u2014 up to th \u2014I have a picture of Soviets in the streets, Russian soldiers in the\nstreets, this demonstration, an ideology that\u2019s against the \u2014 the former independent\ngovernment and so on. But what makes this scary? What makes this aggressive?",
        "Q: The one who said that Germany would lose the war?",
        "Q: Really?",

        "Q: Upperclassmen.",

Mr. Gureckas, I just\nasked you about what was the year \u2014 what was the next half year between January\nand June 1940, what events took place, what things developed, but I thought of\nanother question I wanted to ask, preceding that. And that 1s, of all these betrayals\nthat we\u2019re talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government, what\nwas left of it, betrayal by the, you know, small group of let\u2019s say refugees from\ntsarist Russia, who liked the idea of Russian domination, even if it was with their\ninternal enemies before, betrayal by the Jewish community, or betrayal by\nLithuanian \u2014 Gentile Lithuanians, ethnic Lithuanians, who were communists\nthemselves. Which betrayal do you think you felt in your heart most keenly? Or\nmaybe another betrayal?",

And at that time in\nKlaip\u00e9da was, I think the majority of the population in Klaip\u00e9da city, a majority\nmay be German about that time. In the countryside not so. In the countryside\nLithuanians pre-predominated, but they were also very much influenced by the\nGerman culture through it \u2014 through centuries, really, they were under the German\nrule there. And the \u2014 during the \u2014 when the Nazis came to power, they became very\nageressive in that area. They wanted to \u2014 it was part of the Germany before the first\nWorld War, and the Germany wanted to recover that territory, and they very \u2014 b-\nbecame very aggressive against the Lithuanian. So we were aware of that, that there\nwas a hostile force right next to us.",
        "A: Klaip\u00e9da not so c-close, but the Klaip\u00e9da area, Klaip\u00e9da territory was quite\nnear. I don\u2019t know how many kilometers, maybe seven, eight kilometers from the\nKlaip\u00e9da area, which was au-autonomous area which had, you know, their own\nlaws, German laws, and their th \u2014 bo-both languages were official, Lithuanian and\nGerman. And so we became that Lithuania is now Lithuanian \u2014 Lithuanian\ncharacter and Lithuanian rule and Lithuania is under attack, under \u2014 under pressure\nwhen the \u2014 when \u2014 when Hitler took over in Germany, right there, because before\nthat there was no such hostility. But in Taurag\u00e9 the German population, as far as I\nOctober 14, 2010\nknow were quite loyal to the Lithuania and there were no fric \u2014 friction I am aware\nbetween Germans and Lithuanians in Taurag\u00e9 itself.",

And I was surprised that he didn\u2019t go to Germany when the\nGermans had the chance to go to Germany ah \u2014 when the Soviets took over the li \u2014\nLithuania.",
        "A: No, before this \u2014",

And I was surprised to know that he, that German, didn\u2019t\ngo to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to Germany, because he was so hostile against Hitler, and the\nNazis knew that, that for him to go to the \u2014 to Germany would be to go to \u2014 directly\nto a concentration camp. So he just stayed there with his family, and of course was\nOctober 14, 2010\ndeported to Siberia.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Both, but infrequently. Since my father was working in his capacity as an\nassistant prosecutor, I would say the young students, after they graduated from the\nlaw school in Lithuania had to, if they wanted to work in the court system \u2014 but\nalso, if they would like to become lawyers, they had to go through a \u2014 some practice\nin various capacities. So my father always had some young, just graduated young\nman or \u2014 or ladies, one of \u2014 of them was \u2014 was a lady, who just went through the\npractice several months \u2014 well, not a year maybe, maybe a year, I don\u2019t know\nexactly what the term was. So some of them were Jewish, and I remember ra \u2014 you\nknow, Mr. toris -- Terispolstis(ph), wh-who was practicing with my father, and also\nOctober 14, 2010\nhad, you know, just a relation.

I don\u2019t remember it very well, but they tell me that I\nfound my father\u2019s pistol, and I took that \u2014 that pistol and I went through wh-where\nmy father\u2019s office was, and where Mr. Terispolstis(ph) was working. My father was\nnot in the office, he was on some \u2014 I don\u2019t know, some errand. And so I went to Mr.\nTerispolstis(ph) and said, look what I found, you know, and showed the pistol. And\nhe said, oh, that\u2019s nice. Just s-show it to me. And he just jumped, you know, on me,\nbecause he was afraid that the, you know, stupid kid \u2014",

        "A: Yes, we discuss things of \u2014 various things, whatever. And he sometimes took\nsome educational things, you know, told me about finance, about his work, about the\nproblems they have, or \u2014 well, they had s \u2014 he had some arithmetical exercises, some\narithmetical puzzles which he \u2014 that was educational, so \u2014 so he spent time with me,\nand we \u2014 we were very, very, very close.",

        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Mostly it was in connection with the religious differences, and with the\ndiscussion about the \u2014 a Holy Bible, the Jewish Torah and the Catholic\ninterpretations of that. You know, something like that. You see, I had a c \u2014 a cousin\nfrom my father\u2019s s-side, my father\u2019s oldest brother had a ch \u2014a son, older than\nmyself, who became a Catholic priest. So \u2014 and he visited our family quite often for\nawhile, he lived with us, but not for su \u2014 but \u2014 he was no \u2014 th-that time 1-1n \u2014 1n th \u2014\nhigh school, but later he became a c \u2014 a Catholic priest.

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, I would s \u2014 I\u2014I would sel \u2014 I would say b-both. It was \u2014 but when \u2014 when\n\u2014 when my cousin became a priest and I was a teenager, I think \u2014 a-and \u2014 and my\nfather also joined those discussions, I think they were \u2014 they were quite, quite\nadvanced in \u2014 and \u2014 and in \u2014 it was not a primitive thing at all.",
        "A: Well, first recall s \u2014 discussion about \u2014 about God itself, whether \u2014 whether you\nknow, believing or not believing, and then, you know, going \u2014 going f \u2014 well, tha-\nthat was not \u2014 it had nothing with the Jewish, it was generally.",
        "A: Whether there is a supreme being, you know, and cause of everything, of\nexistence of the world. And as far as the Holy Bible is concerned, of course, the\nquestion about the Christ, about his importance and what \u2014 what \u2014 who was he real \u2014\nreally, Jesus from Nazareth. So those \u2014 those things were, you know \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Well, of course, in a Catholic way, you know, that he was a per-person \u2014 a divine\nperson.",
        "A: Part of the divinity, something like \u2014 yeah, something in th \u2014 1n that way. But it\nwas discussed, 1t wasn\u2019t discussed in which way, you know, what \u2014 what proves that,\nwhy we \u2014 do we believe it li-like this or something. It was not something given, you\nknow, so \u2014",
        "A: Well, they are part of the Catholic \u2014 Catholic religion. My \u2014 my cousin told once,\nyou know, or even several times that, you know, that there are some elements in\nCatholic liturgy which was saved from the old-time Jewish customs and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nwhich the Jews, the rabbinical Jews have lost. So even that the Catholics have\nsomething from the older Jewish religions, 1t was not ant \u2014 anti Jewish at all like its \u2014\nitself, 1t was a discussion of the relationship of the Jewish religion and the Catholic\nreligion \u2014 well, Christian religion, which really split off from \u2014 from the Judaism,\nand why did they split off, and \u2014 well, of course they then \u2014 the \u2014 the person of Jesus\nof Nazareth comes into that. That\u2019s why you know, and what he \u2014 what was his\nmessage basically, and why did they had to split from the Jewish what \u2014 what the\nOctober 14, 2010\nJews had rejected and the Catholics accepted \u2014 I mean Christians accepted.\nSomething like that.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, I see.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know in the larger community because tha-that type of discussions were\nkind of inside of the family. Rarely, you know, sometimes we talk with other priests.\nIt was not subject which people would just meet and start discussing like this.",
        "A: And \u2014 but in my family in particular when \u2014 when my \u2014 my cousin became a\npriest, you know, those things came up regularly. And there was, yes \u2014 well, there is\nsomething in \u2014 in \u2014 in the gospels which calls about the je \u2014 y-you know, the Jewish\nOctober 14, 2010\npeople demanding that Jesus from Nazareth would be executed. You know, and\nthere was something of that. But it \u2014 my cousin, my \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin also, he was a\nCatholic priest, had no hostility against the Jews as such. He was also interested and\nfascinating 1-in relationship and in \u2014 in the common heritage with the Jews. So, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: In my family, I \u2014 I would say there was not much religious or ethnical prejudice\nagainst neither the Jews, nor Germans, except the Poles.",
        "A: Somehow in my family, the Poles, th-they just \u2014 they just couldn\u2019t stand them.",
        "A: Because of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of this whole relationship which re-resulted in the Polish\narmy seizing the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius.",
        "A: And my father was at that time in the Lithuanian army, and my mother was in\nVilnius in \u2014 in the foreign industry of Lithuania, had to flee from the advancing\nPolish army, and you know, th-the \u2014 th-they took it personally, really.\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "A: But with the Poles, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In Taurage.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: About 11.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh, until I went to the university in Vilnius, so it\u2019s \u2014 it was in 1941. Eight years, I\nwould say.",
        "A: Eight years.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: For \u2014 for me it was \u2014 it was different. And I came from Taurag\u00e9 and I felt\nsuperior, because it seemed to me like it\u2019s much less sophisticated city, much less\nsophitis \u2014 sophisticated school, and much less sophisticated friends I had in my scho\n\u2014 in my school, you know?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: So I felt, you know \u2014 you know, a loss of Taurag\u00e9, you know\u201d? The interesting\nsophisticated city. Now, there were \u2014 there were some Germans in \u2014 1n pen \u2014 in\nPanev\u00e9zys, but really few of them.",
        "A: There were some Poles, there some Russians, which didn \u2014 we didn\u2019t have in\nTaurag\u00e9. So ethnic \u2014 ethnic \u2014 you know, was completely different. There were a lot\nof Jews in \u2014 in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys, and there was a very small community, but\ninfluential, and a community of Karayims.",
        "A: Karayims are \u2014 it seems like they are of Turkish descent. Their language 1s\nsimilar to Turkish language. Racially they look like, you know, like Turks or Tartars,\nbut religiously they are Jews. They are Jews, but they do not accept the talmu \u2014\nTalmudic Judaism. They just accept Torah.",
        "A: And refuse to co \u2014 you know, to accept any other authorities outside of Torah,\nany you know, rabbi\u2019s interpretations, Talmudian [indecipherable], they just reject\nthat.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: And the Jews consider them co \u2014 you know, ra \u2014 I think that Jews didn\u2019t consider\nthem really Jews at all. They dom \u2014 do not consider themselves rabbinical Jews. Th-\nThere is a hoso \u2014 there was some hostility between Jews and Karayims.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, they were brought here, ye \u2014 to Lithuania, all this \u2014 going through old \u2014\nold history, but Lithuania\u2019s ruler, Vytautas the Great \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on his \u2014 when he was ruling Lithuania, Lithuania was really an empire\nbecause took a lot of territory up to the Black Sea, and he went to the Crimea, and\nin Crimea there was that Karayim community. And he brought several families, I\nthink 40 or more families to Lithuania with the purpose that they would be his\npersonal guard.",
        "A: You see, they\u2019re outside. They\u2019re complete outsiders. They just rely on the grand\ndukes of Lithuania and he 1-is guarding them. He couldn\u2019t trust Lithuanians because\nthere were, you know, well, there were some of his friends, but there was friends of\nhis cousin, who was his rival, and all that kind of thing. The cris \u2014 Lithuania was\nbecoming Christian, there were still old pagans, who didn\u2019t like the ca \u2014 so he \u2014 he\nOctober 14, 2010\nthought that he\u2019d better rely on the people who nobody could even communicate\nwith at the beginning. Well later they learned, of course, Lithuanian language, but \u2014\nbut still, they were \u2014 and they worship his memory even now.",
        "A: Because they \u2014",
        "A: Yes. And they were living in Trakai where Vytautas was mostly residing and\nthey had, you know, the duty to \u2014 to protect the castle, go to the guard duty in castle.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: How they came to Panev\u00e9zys, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Because they were di \u2014",
        "A: Really, really, my first impression was wrong, the high school was very good,\nyou know, and compared with other Lithuanian high schools was wa \u2014 ca \u2014 was not\nthe first, maybe \u2014 well, of course it wasn\u2019t the first, the first was [indecipherable]\nthe most ad-advanced. But \u2014 but 1t was a very good school, and had very good\nOctober 14, 2010\nteachers, and \u2014 in most of the subjects. And the people were friendly, and so I\nenjoyed that \u2014 that, very much, you know. I was a poor student, because my father\nsend me to grammar school one year earlier. Usually 1-it started at seven, he sent me\nat six. And I was not a good student, neither in Taurag\u00e9, nor in Panev\u00e9zys, until the\nfi \u2014 my fifth class, fifth year class where I w-was left for a year, you know, to repeat\nthe course in \u2014 in that school, because my mathematics we-were not good. Of course\nI was also sick, I missed classes, and so I was le \u2014 let to repeat the course 1n the \u2014 in\nthe first ye \u2014 fifth year. And that helped me a lot. After that I became a good su \u2014\nstudent. So my father overestimated me. I was just an average, exactly as \u2014 as\u2014 I am\n\u2014 lam not\u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, about to \u2014 I would say, 30,000 maybe.",
        "A: Maybe more, yeah.",
        "A: Or it will be more, would be more, m-maybe 40,000, close to 50.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Something like that.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, it was rather quiet years until \u2014 until the situation in Lithuania became\ndangerous, and the first ulttmatum, the Polish ultimatum came through, you know,\nand then the people are aware that the country 1s in danger. And then, of course, was\na lot of discussion and concern, and taking positions and such like \u2014 like that. But\ngeneral \u2014 the relationship between nationalities \u2014 well, I said taura \u2014 Taurag\u00e9 there\nwere no \u2014 no \u2014 no hostility. While in Panev\u00e9zys definitely there was, because there\nwas a Polish gymnasium also.",
        "A: And there were Poles in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys, and that was already the host \u2014\nho-hostile element, because they were considered disloyal to Lithuanian state.\nMaybe they were not, but the Lithuanians looked at them thi \u2014 with \u2014 with suspicion\nthat they might be disloyal.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, there were no particular incidents, but there were na \u2014 th \u2014 our \u2014 the young\npeople, the teenagers, Lithuanian, Polish, we didn\u2019t fight or anything like that, but\nwe ignored each other, mostly.",
        "A: Sometimes I had some discussion with them, but discussions \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I met one of them, but no, no, no, I didn\u2019t have any friends in there.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we had the suspicion that the Poles generally were against the\nLithuanian state. That we \u2014 they wanted to recreate the Polish Lithuanian\ncommonwealth. But in the modern times we were susp \u2014 sus \u2014 suspecting that they\njust wanted a \u2014 to annex Lithuania and \u2014 and that\u2019s all.",
        "A: And we felt that they denied, you know, the Lithuanians, in their mind that they\nwere denying our right as \u2014 as a nation to keep our own state with our own capital,\nOctober 14, 2010\nhistorical capital. And that \u2014 that was the hostility. Now, it was quite clear I never,\nyou know, th \u2014 even thought about that, that between Lithuanians and Poles \u2014 b-\nbetween the young people, the teenagers who went to different gymnasium, that\nbetween those gymnasiums there were no \u2014 no relationship really. But I don\u2019t know\nwhy there was no relationship with the Jewish j \u2014 schools which were in \u2014 in\nPanev\u00e9zys.",
        "A: There were no relations. We had some Jews who went to Lithuanian school, and\nwa \u2014 by class, you know, classmates. But \u2014 and we were fine, we were friends, we\nwere 0-okay. But the relationship between the Jewish gy-gymnasium and Poland \u2014\nand Lithuanian gymnasium was just nonexistent. And I don\u2019t know at \u2014 even now I\ncouldn\u2019t explain why it was so, because there was no such hostility at all, and\nLithuanians considered Jews, you know, the Jews also supported Lithuanian claim to\nVilnius usually, the great majority, I wouldn\u2019t know about all but ye \u2014 th-the great\nmajority was supporting that. And they [indecipherable] Lithuania recovered\nVilnius, the Jewish community was \u2014 was quite friendly, and wh-while the Polish, of\ncourse, people were very hostile.\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "A: Right, right, and the Poles demanded and demanded, you know, with ultimatum.\nThat means, if not, there would be war.",
        "A: And Lithuania accepted that. The Poles didn\u2019t require that Lithuania renounce\nVilnius as a\u2014 or \u2014 or renounce, you know, Lithuanian claim to Vilnius. It didn\u2019t\nmention Vilnius at all.",

        "A: Well, we suspected that they always want to take over Lithuania eventually.\nThat\u2019s one thing. But at that time, Poland considers itself a great power in Europe\nand Germany just took over Austria and Poland wanted compensation as a great\npower, you know, so at least, you know, they \u2014 they took this step against Lithuania\nto showing that they are also \u2014 can act, you know.",

Didn\u2019t like it at all.\nAlthough I was skeptical at that time about Vilnius, you know. I thought well, you\nknow, we are no-not going to recover Vilnius ever.

But I thought wow, that\u2019s\n\u2014 that\u2019s an unrealistic, we might as well forget about it. But \u2014 but this was then a\nPolish ultimatum, the Polish demand, you know. It still hurt.

He was working he \u2014 with them, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was\nhelping during the 1905, 1905 there was a revolution in Russia, and in Lithuania it\ntook a national character; Lithuanians against the Russian suppression.

So, you\nknow, it\u2019s tradition going way back. And I don\u2019t know how to explain. It was a small\ncountry, and the fe \u2014 people felt that, you know, these things really affect them. The\ncountry\u2019s independence was precarious during that time, and of course, I mean, my\nfather was working for the government, so 1-if \u2014 if \u20141f the country is occupied, I\nmean, he has no job. I think maybe that also had something to do. I \u2014 really, we\ndidn\u2019t pose those questions that way, so I am not sure.",
        "A: That\u2019s what it seems to me, but \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010\nbut what kind of discussions were going on, what kind of sensibility was there about\nthe Soviet Union? What role did that play in Panev\u00e9zys, you know, and what was\ngoing on? What did you know of what was going on in Soviet Russia, and the union\nitself?",
        "A: We knew some, we knew the \u2014 you know, my ma \u2014 my f-\u2014 my father see the\nbeginnings of the Russian revolution in Russia. I would say so. Again, the Polish\nthing. Soviet Union was supporting Lithuania in this Polish Lithuanian conflict. Or\nsupporting Lithuania\u2019s claim to Vilnius.",
        "A: All along. The only one of the great powers. The Germans also didn\u2019t recognize\nthe Polish annextion of Vilnius, but the Germans were not willing to, you know, to\ntake stand, or support Lithuania or something like that. So they kept more or less\noutside of that \u2014 of that issue. The Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan supported\nPoland. So the only great power supporting \u2014 United States were behind the area,\nyou know, they didn\u2019t \u2014 it was time of isolation, they didn\u2019t \u2014 tried not to take any\nstance in European affairs at all. So the only real power supporting Lithuania was\nSoviet Union. Now, my parents, being good Catholics and Lithuanians, they\ndisapproved of the communist system as such. But there was little discussion of that,\nyou know, all of the memories of revolution as my father said, I mean he thought\nthat revolution was, of course, a cruel period of time. A lot of things happened, but\nOctober 14, 2010\nhe thought that, you know, after all this time, there was some \u2014 some normality in\nthe country. Even he didn't wanted to believe that there was a constant terror or\nsomething like that.

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, the next year the Germans demanded the Klaip\u00e9da area.",

The Jewish people,\nand the Lithuanian people who were committed to Lithuanian cause became\nrefugees. They didn\u2019t want \u2014 and Panev\u00e9zys, they came even to Panev\u00e9zys, the\nOctober 14, 2010\npeople. And there were appeals, you know, that \u2014 you know, for living space, for\nother things, for jobs for those refugees. So my parents decided, you know, that we\nhad a nice house, it was our own house. We have too much space, we can \u2014 we could\nrent, you know, the upstairs, you know, to somebody. And we rent it to a girl who\ncame from Klaip\u00e9da as a refugee, and well, simply, we \u2014 he \u2014 she worked in \u2014 in \u2014\nin Misetas(ph) co-company, you know.",
        "A: As a clerk, you know, as a clerk, you know, so th-that was a refugee, we came to\nour \u2014 to our house. And there were more those refugees, one of my father\u2019s \u2014 th-the\nlegal students who were taking practice with my father was also from Lithuania\nMinor, and he came, you know, to work there, so we met him directly, and of course\nthe Jewish people took care of the Jewish refugees \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, yeah, she did.",
        "A: She \u2014 she was not from the \u2014 that area. She was from | \u2014 from Lithuania, she was\nCatholic, you know, Lithuanian \u2014 Lithuanians from Lithuania Minor are usually\nLutherans. She ca \u2014 when a young girl she came to Klaip\u00e9da to work there.",
        "A: And now she became a refugee, because she \u2014 she lived for years there, you\nknow, and \u2014 and came back. So she told, you know, about the \u2014 the Nazis, how they\nacted there, you know, how they at-attacked Lithuanians and Lithuanian institutions.\nThey became more and more, you know, aggressive as the time went on, until it was,\nyou know, really a problem for the Lithuanian even to exist there. The Nazis were\ntrying to, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to dominate that area at all, and of course, you\nknow, they demanded Klaip\u00e9da for Germany, and Lithuania couldn\u2019t resist, and\nyou know, they \u2014 they just had to flee that \u2014 that country. Hitler himself came to\nOctober 14, 2010\nKlaip\u00e9da, you know, and well, was a very sad moment for Lithuania, but we felt\nthat\u2019s \u2014 it was a superior \u2014 superior power, couldn\u2019t do much about it.",
        "A: Ye-es, yes, but not in our circle, in our family circle. The closest I know was our\nCatholic priest, a teacher of religion in our school. He was impressed by the order\nand discipline of the Nazi movement, and during the lessons, you know, sometimes\nhe made Germany \u2014 the Nazi Germany as an example of, you know, of a\ndisciplined, purposeful society. But that was really ther \u2014 we heard about other\npeople, you know, who \u2014 who were f-friendly to Germans, but there were very, very\nfew of them, because Lithuania was under direct attack at that time, with Klaip\u00e9da.\nEverybody was very sad that Klaip\u00e9da was lost.",

        "A: Well, the next thing was that summer, 1939, from ow \u2014 ou-our school, there was\nan excursion to Vilnius, because the diplomatic relations were established, the\ncommunications were already established, you know, we could \u2014 we could go to\nVilnius, you know, to visit the city. So my \u2014 my school decided to have an\nexcursion. So, I to \u2014 my parents, you know, agreed that they had to pay some money,\nI don\u2019t know, for that, but they agreed that I go on that excursion, and I went with a\ngroup of my classmates to \u2014 to Vilnius. And it made a great impression on me, the\ncity. The great impression of the old Lithuanian history connected to the city, where\nthere were signs all around. The Lithuanian coat of arms, you know, was on the city\ngate. Ancient.",
        "A: One. One. Yeah, one was \u2014 because AuSros Vartai, it wou \u2014 had \u2014 it had the\nchapel, had some religious meaning, so it \u2014 the gate was not demolished, all other\ngates were.",

        "A: So, but \u2014 but an-anywhere else, at the churches, at the bridges, we could see our \u2014\nthe coat of arms of our country. The old ones. Of course, the new offices had Polish\nsigns, but nothing has \u2014 did \u2014 as far as history \u2014 well, there was some in\ncombination, when the co-countries \u2014 was a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth while\nthe countries were united in one commonwealth, there was a \u2014 also a no \u2014 Polish\neagle, Lithuanian knight, and so on, you know, bi \u2014 from those times. But always,\nalways the Lithuanian knight. And [indecipherable] thing, and so Lithuanian\nstudents met our excursion, and he was a leader of our excursion, so the city told\nabout how Lithuanians lived under the Poles, you know, and we went to Lithuanian\ns-s \u2014 girls\u2019 school, the girls \u2014 the \u2014 it was summer, so the girls went home, so the\nschool was empty, so \u2014 but they accommodated us. So we were \u2014 we still in Vilnius\nwere in midst of the Lithuanian community there, which was very small, and really\noppressed, but they were proud because they felt that they were oppressed, and they\nwere right that there was something wrong, you know, with the Polish government,\nthat they \u2014 they were oppressing the Lithuanians anyways.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 they had some, but there were \u2014 one of the \u2014 the other were, they\nclosing those schools, and they had the one high school in Vilnius itself.",
        "A: Just the only one. There were bef \u2014 many more before, but they were closed.",
        "A: But in Vilnius there was one.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, in Vilnius was \u2014 in Lithuania that was not that obvious, but in Vilnius,\nyes.",
        "A: Well, there were \u2014 there were all po \u2014 oh, there\u2019s su-such like \u2014 first of all, there\nwere military demonstrations of the Poles. There were parades. We were, you know,\nOctober 14, 2010\nlooking at one of the parades 1-in Vilnius, of artillery regiment there, and we were\ncomparing that because there was artillery regiment in Panev\u00e9zys also. So we were\ncomparing how it is and we looked, you know, boy, our soldiers look much more,\nyou know, much better, better clothes, better \u2014 and didn\u2019t impress us as \u2014 at all. But\nthere were also the signs all over the Vilnius that \u2014 in Polish \u2014 that we are not going\nto retreat from our seashore. And they were \u2014 they were ready to fight. They we \u2014\nknew the war is coming, or at least suspected the war is coming, and they \u2014 they are\nnot going like the Czechs or Lithuanians who gave up Klaip\u00e9da, or the Czechs who\ngave up the Sudetenland, they are going to fight. They are not going to give in to\nthe Nazis \u2014 to the \u2014 Nazis they didn\u2019t mention that, just to the Germans.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 so it was obvious, the war is coming.",
        "A: Which was not obvious in Panev\u00e9zys \u2014",
        "A: Yes, but this was quite, you know, quite my place. And here, you know \u2014 and we\nmet one Polish girl, who was just graduated from \u2014 from the high school and was\nvisiting her relatives in Vilnius, and we talked with her, you know, and beca \u2014 she\nwas very friendly, we talked in German with her.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: And she knew German, and she knew, you know, that the war is coming, but he \u2014\nshe didn\u2019t think, you know, about all those horrible things. So \u2014 so what, you know?\nWhat \u2014 what are the Germans going to do to me, you know? Well, nothing, you\nknow. It doesn\u2019t matter, you know, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, for that girl, didn\u2019t touch it.",
        "A: Sh \u2014 she didn\u2019t care. I am sure, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it touched her terribly, eventually.",
        "A: And pretty soon. Just a few months.",
        "A: Yes, it changed my opinion. As I said, I was skeptical about Lithuanian claim to\nVilnius because it\u2019s \u2014 it might be right, but it seemed too unrealistic to me. But after\nthis excursion I changed my opinion completely.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: In what way? That this 1 \u2014 that\u2019s what the Lithuanian capital is. I mean, the Poles\ntook it over, but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what it \u2014 the capital is. That\u2019s what the Lithuanian\nlaw says, that\u2019s what\u2019s Lithuanian constitution said. The capital city of Vilnius is\nLithuania\u2019s capital. So \u2014 and I thought that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what it is. Maybe \u2014\nmaybe we d-don\u2019t recover the Vilnius, I don\u2019t know, you know, but \u2014",

        "A: Right, right.",

        "A: \u2014 and even the people who \u2014 who were friendly with our family, the other\nfamilies also were very much interested in that experience. Nobody saw Vilnius for\n19 years, and now suddenly, you know, I saw that \u2014 that city, and everybody wanted\n\u2014 and even Lithuanian officers were interested, in my opinion how did the Polish\narmy look to me? You know, and all that kind of thing, you know. I was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014a center of attention.",
        "A: Th \u2014 that \u2014 I\u2014 I was just \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, no, well, I\u2014 I was just so \u2014 so proud, you know. Not so proud, but I tried to\nbe, you know, controlled about it, but I felt very well about that.",
        "A: You know, that I had that experience. And then suddenly in [indecipherable] th-\nthe \u2014 the vacation was ending, but the school didn\u2019t start yet. School starts on\nSeptember the first. But the week before I went to the gymnasium, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, I met some of my friends and there, you know, I found out before \u2014 before the\nnewspapers came out, or something like that, I found out about Ribbentrop-\nMolotov agreement.",
        "A: Well, it was that they committed themselves, both countries \u2014",
        "A: Germany and Soviet Union committed themselves not to fight against each\nother, even in a c \u2014 1n a cong \u2014 if the conflict with a third countries comes, that they\nwouldn\u2019t be involved, they would keep neutrality in that conf-conflict. So, since we\nknew that there were discussions between British and French and the Soviets, ho-\nhow to stand up against German ag-agegression, suddenly this disappeared, you\nknow, suddenly Soviets Union said no, we are not going to make a stand. And the\nBritish and French, you know, just \u2014 just went home. That was the whole power\nsituation. And the people thought that if there would be agreement between Great\nOctober 14, 2010\nBritain, France and the Soviet Union, that there would be no war, because the\nsuperiority of this combination should have been clear even to Hitler. So they\nthought, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, but af-after \u2014 after visit to Vilnius I became political.",

        "A: Their parents. I \u2014 we \u2014 we started discussing, I said no, so what, I mean, so what?\nThere is no wars on, does it matter much? And my friend said, you know, well, my\nfather said that, you know, this means war. Because, you know, the Germans were\nma \u2014 will be not d-deterred by the superior power of three great countries, Great\nBritain, France and Soviet Union. So that means the war is coming.

        "A: All right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And then the school started September first, and the war started, of course, and\nthat was news, and everybody was listening to the radio, and everybody was\nfollowing what\u2019s going on, and quite soon it was clear, you know, o-of the German\nsuperiority, which we thought even before. I didn\u2019t see it, but other people saw the\nGerman army in Klaip\u00e9da. We saw Polish army in \u2014 in Vilnius, and it was obvious,\nyou know, that the Germans were much better prepared, and much stronger army\nthan the Poles, and even before the war started, we thought that the Poles are going\nto lose the war. And of course, we \u2014 we kids, you know, were, because of that\nhostility with the Poles, we thought that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a nice time for Lithuania to\nrecover Vilnius. The Germans are attacking Poland and pole \u2014 Polish army\nOctober 14, 2010\ndefinitely is losing, like in the first days it was quite obvious a German attack was,\nyou know, the Blitzkrieg. They \u2014 they went very, very strongly wi-with air \u2014 air\nattacks, armored formations. So we thought well, you know, why Lithuanian army\ndoesn\u2019t go there and recover Vilnius, because Poles will be not able to resist any\nmore.",
        "A: Not in the those circles I was in.",
        "A: Not in my co \u2014 friends, classmates, no. Not in my family. But, our director of-of\nour school told us Germans are not going to win this war. It is world war, and the\nGermans are going to lose, and we shouldn\u2019t interfere in the war now. He didn\u2019t say\nthat, you know, he \u2014 he simp \u2014 in sympathy with Poles or something. Maybe he was,\nI don\u2019t know. But he was convinced that the Nazis are going to lose. And it seems\nlike not some kind of a military or \u2014 or \u2014 or economical analysis, but because the\nNazi ideology, that generation knew Germans from the first occupation during the\nfirst World War. And they were convinced that the Germans were always overdoing.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Overreaching. In the first World War, and from the Nazi ideology they deducted\nthat the Nazis are ric \u2014 ready to do the same thing, to overreach more, even more\nthan the \u2014 during the first World War. So they were \u2014 and our president, Antanas\nSmetona also was of that opinion. Some of the officers of Lithuanian army, some o-\nof the diplomats said, I mean, it\u2019s a chance to recover Vilnius, let\u2019s go, and Germans\nwere encouraging Lithuanians, encouraging, you know, that wil \u2014 Lithuania wil \u2014\nwould go and recover Vilnius. And the British said, in that case, Great Britain will\ndeclare war against Lithuania. But well, now this is the question, who will de \u2014 will\nwin the war, and Smetona was convinced that Germans are going to lose, and he\ndidn't \u2014 we didn\u2019t know about that time, but we knew, you know, later, that Smetona\nwas against that, and that\u2019s why Lithuania didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t attack Poland at that\ntime, because of Smetona and of thinking, which our director told to us\n[indecipherable]",

Fascism of Italian type had more sympathies. There were not too\nmany, but Italians type was closer. There was no racism in \u2014 in Italy, in \u2014 at least at\nthe beginning, na \u2014 and \u2014 so, but in \u2014 in \u2014 in our circles, no, you know, there was no\n\u2014no sympathy for the Nazis.",

Also, as I said, our \u2014\ndirector of our school also was of that opinion, and \u2014 and there was other people,\nolder people who said, you know, don\u2019t do that. Now, even if Lithuania would have\nattacked Vilnius, that doesn\u2019t mean that it would be pro-Nazi because he is all \u2014 th-\nthe Soviet Union supported Lithuania in the Polish-Lithuanian \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",

Not \u2014 they \u2014 Finns didn\u2019t\nbecame Nazis at all, they were allies during the second World War with the\nGermans, but they still were a democratic country, and had nothing to do with the\nNazi ideology at all. So that was the idea. Of course, it was unrealistic. If \u2014 1f would\nhave happened, of course, Nazis would have taken everything that \u2014 but the hope\nwas that, you know, well, so we are allies, just like we were allies with the Soviets,\nnow we\u2019re allies with the Germans. But S-Smetona was against that, Smetona was\na very strong leader, maybe a d \u2014 we could call it dictator, and without him, you\nknow, nothing \u2014 nothing happens.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Yes, of it \u2014 it does. First of all, the war, you know, the \u2014 some of the things, the\ncommerce became affected. There were some Lithuanian ships which were ru-run on\nthe mines, and we \u2014 one of the sailors, a brother of our classmate came back, I mean\nhis ship was sunk in the Baltic Sea because ran on the mine. It\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Well, hit a mine, well, there were non-contact mines also, you know at that time.",

        "A: \u2014 of the water, right. So, you know. And then of course \u2014 and of course the ca \u2014\nthe concern whether Lithuania could become \u2014 still be ne \u2014 neutral when such a gr-\ngreat war is starting around. And when the Soviets attacked Poland also, from the\neast, then everybody became concerned what\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s now. Because the Soviets\nare taking over all the eastern portion of Poland \u2014 well, really the Ukrainians,\nByelorussians and Lithuanians living there, but doesn\u2019t matter, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 was\nstill Poland. They took Vilnius, the Soviets, and now, you know, everybody became\n\u2014now we are involved. Soviets recognize Vilnius as Lithuania\u2019s capital, now they\n\u2014 are they going to turn it over to us, or will they find, you know, some kind of thing\nto \u2014 to get out of it, of the \u2014 the commitment. And there was mobilization. There was\ndeclared, you know, the Lithuanian army was mobilized to protect its neutrality, not\nOctober 14, 2010\nfor war. But the Polish army, you know, went over the boundary to Lithuania and\nwas disarmed, so they had \u2014 Lithuania army had to be there to disarm the Polish\narmy coming over, and to intern them as the neutral country\u2019s supposed to do in such\ncase. And a lot of Polish military came over, and refugees \u2014 generally refugees, not\nmilitary refugees from Poland came to Lithuania, and they found quite \u2014 quite a bit\nof understanding and sympathy then, you know. Poland was defeated and broken\nand then, you know, it seemed like, you know \u2014 not \u2014 not an enemy any more you\nhad to fight, you know. So the \u2014 there was sympathy for them and \u2014 and \u2014 and all the\nroutine mobilization, we thought wi \u2014 the Lithuanian army being mobilized that they\nwill go to Vilnius. And we \u2014 we were all, in our class I think everybody was, you\nknow, why our army 1s not going there? But as I said, the director explained to us,\nwe didn't believe him, but that\u2019s what it was, the older generation decided it would\nbe foolish to get into that war. And \u2014 but then we were very much tol \u2014 concerned,\nwhat will be next, you know, everybody was concerned. There was organization, so-\ncalled Sauliai(ph).",
        "A: It is close to national guard, p-partly like a reserves, part like national guard.\nThere was a military people a-after they served in the army, they were released into\nreserves, and they voluntarily joined that organization, which was a military\norganization, but not quite. It differs, for instance, from the national guard in that\nOctober 14, 2010\nwas \u2014 that he \u2014 they had also cultural thing. They had dances, they had lectures also,\nyou know.",
        "A: Somewhat civic, yeah. But it was very popular, a lot of people in the \u2014 men, and\nalso women belonged to that organization.

I belonged too, voluntarily, whoever wanted, there was no pressure at\nall to join, but I joined it. And we were also called to duty then.",
        "A: Then the mobilization came and we were sent to \u2014 on the guard duty in \u2014 in the\ncity as a\u2014 I\u2019m writing in my memoirs, there will be no \u2014 our students were not quite\nmilitary minded at all, you know, they might have m-made \u2014 made a \u2014 a \u2014 a play out\nof it, and it was a serious thing, so we \u2014 we were removed from the guard duty and\nsent to a place where there were no people.",

They started on, you\nknow, ch-checking their bags and all that kind of thing, and it was a flirt really. And\nit was \u2014 and when \u2014 when the leaders found out, they were terrified. They said, I\nOctober 14, 2010\nmean, the p \u2014 the parents will complain, so we will go before court martial for this\nthing, you know. So they took off of \u2014 of duty us completely and sent to guard\ngasoline tanks and \u2014 and outside place. They want \u2014",

Our cl \u2014 school\nwas taking over for \u2014 for military ca \u2014 no, the girls\u2019 school was taking over for the \u2014\nthe military. The girls went to our school in the daytime, we went during the\nnighttime to our school, because it was different schools, girl and \u2014 and boys\u2019\nschool. And \u2014 but it was a short period of time, and of course there was news that,\nyou know, Lithuania is recovering Vilnius, Soviets are letting have Vilnius for\nLithuania. Not all the territory which Lithuania claimed and the Soviets recognized\nbefore, you know, they \u2014 they just returned a quarter of the territory, but with the\ncapital city. And also was news that, you know, the military bases, Soviet military\nbases will be introduced in Lithuania. The Soviets will have military bases in\nLithuania. So, everybody was really happy that Vilnius is returning to Lithuania,\nOctober 14, 2010\nand everybody was concerned that the Soviet army is being introduced in Lithuania\nand having bases here. It was not a big surprise really, because before that Estonia\nand Latvia already were forced. They didn\u2019t get anything, but they had to take in\nSoviet bases, Soviet guard [indecipherable]",

        "A: Well, personally I didn't have, at that time, connections. We had Jewish friends in\nour \u2014 in our class, but \u2014 and one was fairly close to me, but we somehow didn\u2019t\ndiscuss much about this situation. But it was from my parents\u2019 contacts, we knew\nthat, of course the Jews were concerned about the German attack, and the German\nstrength, which they showed, you know, and the power. And of course everybody\nknew how hostile the Nazis are against \u2014 against the Jews. So, the concern was quite\nstunder \u2014 understandable. But that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s about \u2014 about it. I mean, there were\nconcern, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t know. Of course they \u2014 they were not in favor that Lithuania would\nattack Poland, you know, but [indecipherable] they didn\u2019t.",

        "A: We [indecipherable] the Lithuanian delegation, government delegation was in\nMoscow.",
        "A: So we knew that it will be decided one way or the other, and so everybody was\njust glued to the radio and listening when the end \u2014 when it was announced, you\nknow, the news, and eventually it was, you know, that this \u2014 the treaty between\nLithuania and Soviet Union is signed and Vilnius is really \u2014 really turned to\nLithuania, and the military garrisons will be introduced in Lithuania, Soviet\nmilitary.",
        "A: It was, yeah, it was 1939, October 10\" was they signed the treaty and we knew\nabout that October 11\", in the morning, from the radio.",
        "A: Yeah, and then, of course, newspapers. And the newspapers were a great\ndisappointment because they showed new boundary between Lithuania and the\nSoviet Union, and as I said, I mean, just a quarter of the territory was being returned\nto Lithuania, three-quarters was just kept, Stalin for themself. And the problem is\nthat the Lithuanian areas were the farmers, and generally the population was\nOctober 14, 2010\nLithuanian in that area. They fell to the \u2014 to th \u2014 to the Soviet side, you know.\nLithuania didn\u2019t receive even those territories which were ethnically Lithuanian.",
        "A: It became part of Belarus then.",
        "A: Par \u2014 became part of Belarus. Later the boundary was adjusted when Lithuania\nwas occupied, but the areas like Druskininkai, like Sven\u00e9ionys, they were part of\nBelarus \u2014 Belarus at that time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. So the \u2014 the enthusiasm was \u2014 was k-kind of muted at\nthat point, and there was a meeting, you know, and 1-it was muted, until really the\nSoviets \u2014 Soviets kept Vilnius for a couple of weeks yet, and they were r-really\nplundering the ke \u2014 the city during that time, and eventually the Lithuanian army\ntook over Vilnius. And s-somehow you know, at that point, when Lithuanian army\nmarched into Vilnius, the country became split personality, the people said now we\nare going to celebrate, we are going to worry tomorrow. Everybody knew that there\nis a lot of to \u2014 something to worry, but today we are celebrating, tomorrow we are \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010\nare g \u2014 are going to worry.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, that was an accident, the \u2014 well, again, after Lithuania \u2014 the Soviets had\ncalled the government delegation from Finland in \u2014 into Moscow and started\ndiscussions with the Finns, and they had also, you know, demands, which the Finns\nre \u2014 refused. So, in \u2014 in a month\u2019s time the Soviets attacked Finland and became\nFinnish Winter War. And now everybody was for Finns in Lithuania. Soviet Union\nwas supposed to be our ally, and well, ally, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we still were for the Finns,\nthey were so \u2014 so heroically defending their country, you just couldn\u2019t help it. Now,\none of the Soviet planes was bombing Helsinki, ar \u2014 or some other Finnish cities,\nanyway, was one bomb \u2014 on the bombing raid. The Finns were shooting back, and\nthe p \u2014 the pa \u2014 the plane was damaged, couldn\u2019t navigate very well, but turned\nsouth, went over Estonia, Latvia, came to Lithuania and near Panev\u00e9zys, crashed.\nWell, really, crash landed, I would say.",
        "A: Crash landed. The pilots came out and said, I mean, how far is Riga? Well, they\nflew over Riga already, but they couldn\u2019t tell any more. So, the Soviets from their\nOctober 14, 2010\nbarra \u2014 from their military bases in Lithuania came, the Soviet soldiers to that place,\ndismantled the plane and brought it to the railroad station and took it. And we saw\nthen that plane, it went through our gymnasium, through the street in front of us.\nEverybody was at the \u2014 at the window, and we saw the plane, all warped by bullets,\nwhich wa \u2014 wa \u2014 that \u2014 and we saw Soviet soldiers taking that plane away. So that\nwas the first time we saw the Soviet soldiers, taking away that damaged plane.",

        "A: Yes, yeah.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah. Also a bittersweet thing, because you know, w-we like to see the \u2014 the\nplane warped by the Finnish bullets, but then the so \u2014 Soviet soldiers in Lithuania\nwas, you know, a bitter part of it.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two\nOctober 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Well, I could tell about one really ridiculous thing, because we were 15 years old\nwhen the \u2014 there was a tension about Klaip\u00e9da, a problem, the Germans were\npressing Lithuania at that time, and it was clear that they will, sooner or later will\ndemand that Lithuania return Klaip\u00e9da, together with the Klaip\u00e9da territory to\nGermany. So my classmate, and my close friend, he told me that he heard a rumor\nthat there is no organization, but secretly Lithuanian army is mobilizing, taking the\nvolunteers, registering the volunteers, and he \u2014 he kind of suggested that we might\nOctober 14, 2010\nbe interested in that. So I\u2014I said yes. My father was fighting for Lithuania, now it\u2019s\nmy turn, y-you know. And we went together with him to \u2014",
        "A: No, of course not. That would be the end of the story. No, we went together with\nhim to the military office in Panev\u00e9zys, and just asks whether, you know, they \u2014\nthey need any voluntaries to fight for Lithuania. Well, the sergeant there was kind\nof a \u2014 excited. I mean, he was \u2014 he was dumbfounded really, you know. And we\ncouldn\u2019t understand why \u2014 why he was you know, so kind of confused. We just\nwanted to fight for Lithuania, that\u2019s all, that seems so \u2014 and he, an elderly sergeant,\nyou know, was a pr \u2014 now I can see, you know, why \u2014 why he was \u2014 the children\nwant fight for Lithuania, well \u2014 but that was the end of the story. They said no,\nthank you, you know. If we need we will call on you, and we\u2019ll call nev \u2014\neverybody. But now \u2014 now, we don\u2019t need your service. But good \u2014 good boys, you\nknow, grow up. You will be good soldiers someday. Okay, so we went back to class,\nand somehow, apparently my friend told ma \u2014 our \u2014 our friend Rubinsteinas(ph), a\nJewish friend. He was one of our gang, Shalamas(ph) Rubinsteinas(ph), and he \u2014\napparently my friend told him about that story, and he was all upset that we didn\u2019t\ntake him with th \u2014 with \u2014 with us. He also wanted to fight Germans.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, so that was the oh \u2014 the only really disagreement we had with him i-1n our\n\u20141n our friendship. So \u2014 so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the story. After that, of course, we were 1-\nin that organ \u2014 organization, Sauliai, I would call like national guard. And we took\nseriously our duties, you know, whenever we were called upon.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, well that\u2019s \u2014 I didn\u2019t do that.",

And I was\nsick at that time at home, you know, so I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how my friends reacted, and\n\u2014at school. But no, this thing became only when the Soviets occupied Lithuania,\nthen \u2014 then we found tha-that we have to resist that somehow. And that\u2019s another\npart of my story, you know, when a \u2014 when the Soviets annex Lithuania, occupied\nand annexed Lithuania.

And it seemed\nlike, you know, we were a gr \u2014 very upset and apprehensive 1-1n the fall, about\nOctober, November. But in the springtime of 1940, it looked like the things quieted\ndown.",

Of course, other s \u2014 radio stations, German,\nRussian and others were available, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel like we have to use\nthat at that time.",
        "A: It was a six \u2014 sixth year, I-I was yeah, finishing the sixth class, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, the occupation. Because \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, the bases were limited 1n certain places, and they were closed, they\ndidn\u2019t let their soldiers roam around, you know, they were all in \u2014 in the bases. And\nOctober 14, 2010\nsuddenly, you know, the Soviet army \u2014 well, as a \u2014 as I told, I mean, I \u2014 my father\ncame \u2014 we knew that our government delegation is in Moscow, there are some kind\nof problems there, but nobody thought it\u2019s a great deal. And then suddenly my father\ncame from somewhere, called me, and said, you know that the Soviets are occupying\nthe country, taking over the country. And that\u2019s what happened, and that \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: At home. At home.",
        "A: It was already vacation started, you know, and then it was June, and vacation\nstarted, classes were over. And my father were all upset, and excited, and I had my\nfriend with me. And he said, let \u2014 let the friend go. So I said, oh, my \u2014 my father has\nsomething to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for me to do. Well, it was a younger boy from the high school, and \u2014 but two\nclasses lower, because he was younger. He was just \u2014 just as a \u2014 his relationship was\nstrange. He was related to the Polish Marshall Pilsudski, who was \u2014 died \u2014 who died\nby \u2014 by that time he was dead. But he was related through his \u2014 his mother side, you\nknow. And I don\u2019t know whether he considered himself Pole or Lithuanian, but he\nOctober 14, 2010\nwas also very much interested in politics, in wa \u2014 in th-the war going on here. We\ncame, we discussed those things. I was kind of try to be diplomatic, you know, I\ndidn\u2019t show my an \u2014 our hostility \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to the Polish, you know, and I tried to be diplomatic, and then my father came\nand said let \u2014 let him go, and then I said, my father has something to do, has a task.\nAnd then my father said, you know, the Soviets are occupying Lithuania. And that\nwas in the afternoon. Night, we slept during the night. During the night the Soviet\ntroops came from Vilnius, it took Vilnius first and went to Panev\u00e9zys, and started \u2014\nwell, then the tanks, th-the \u2014 the motorized troops, you know, were going \u2014 it \u2014 it\nwas not a \u2014 a garrison, it was not a base. It wa \u2014 they were all over the place. And a \u2014\ntaking over, you know, and taking over the military establishments in Lithuania,\ntaking hi \u2014 the barracks, the \u2014",
        "A: Well, the next morning we came up, they were already went through Panev\u00e9zys,\nthey were in the ba \u2014 in the military barracks somewhere, and they went farther from\nPanev\u00e9zys over Ciulai. We still saw some tanks, some military cars going, you\nknow, on the road, but not ma \u2014 the mass, which was before, you know, during the\nnight.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see that \u2014 that massive movement, it was during the night, and somehow I\ndidn\u2019t hear it, and \u2014 although there should have been some \u2014 some noi \u2014 a lot of\nnoise, but somehow I slept well. And that\u2019s it. And wi \u2014",
        "A: A-All \u2014 all over, in the outskirts, because \u2014",
        "A: Oh, in the \u2014 in the middle of the town, really.",
        "A: We had our house quite near the center, right near my high school. And \u2014 well,\nit\u2019s difficult to say, but you know, there were also reports in the radio, in the press\nthat the president has left Lithuania, he fled Lithuania, so he was condemned that\nhe didn\u2019t stay with his country during the critical time, and all that kind of thing, and\nthis \u2014",
        "A: Still the Lithuanian press, 1t seemed like Lithuanian press, but apparently the\ncontrol was already in \u2014 1n the Soviet hands, or at least in the communist \u2014\nLithuanian communist party\u2019s hands.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 and \u2014 and then, you know, that same day, it was Sunday. Saturday\nthere was the ultimatum and they marched into Lithuania and in Panev\u00e9zys Sunday\nafternoon, I saw the first communist demonstration in Panev\u00e9zys in the main square.\nThe people didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t walk the streets. It was Sunday and the city was kind of\nempty. I went to s \u2014 into this \u2014 the city to take a look at what\u2019s going on. Nothing.\nWere \u2014 were very few people going dur \u2014 during the streets, in the streets. Not like a\nregular Sunday. And then I went to the main square and there was a demonstration,\nnot a big one, maybe 50 - 60 people there.",
        "A: Mostly young, I would say, mostly young people. And they were \u2014 had the red\nflag there, and they were speaking in Lithuanian, you know, against the sovi \u2014\nSmetona government, against the \u2014 the whole system, against the fascist\ngovernment, as they called here \u2014 Smetona\u2019s government. And the others were\nlistening to that, and j-just seemed like all of them \u2014 of the people were Jewish.",
        "A: Well, typically from \u2014 from the racial features, and from the accent the speakers\nused. The listeners, of course, I don\u2019t know. Well, I didn't check all, I was kind of\naside, you know, I wasn\u2019t in the demonstration itself. So it\u2019s difficult to say, you\nknow, the composition, but it \u2014 the impression was like most of them or even all of\nOctober 14, 2010\nthem were Jewish. Now, my fa \u2014 the Jew \u2014 the communist party was illegal in\nLithuania before that. Even when the \u2014 when the bases came in, it still was illegal.\nMy father was working in the court system, and some of the \u2014 of the clients, as he\ncalled, he had some communists also, who were accused just of the communist\nactivities. And so he was concerned that now, you know, that things changed, and\nthose communists will became very influential. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, he had a negative opinion, because one of the \u2014 of the important\ncommunists which he was exim \u2014 examining his activities, was from a very rich\nJewish family in Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "A: From very rich \u2014 pardon?",
        "A: No, I wouldn't, but I\u2014 I could find, because he was important later on, so maybe I\ncould find out later, but I don\u2019t remember exact now. And so 1-1\u2014 even that, you\nknow, for him looked kind of ridiculous or \u2014 or \u2014 or unacceptable that from such a\nrich family, you know, he becomes communist, and is working against the\nLithuanian government, really. And I must say, later he was concerned that he will\nOctober 14, 2010\nbecome imp \u2014 1m \u2014 important person, which was right, he became very important\nperson. But became not in Panev\u00e9zys, but in Vilnius.",
        "A: I ent \u2014 the \u2014 the story is interesting. He was afraid that there will be some\nrevenge. There was nothing from that. He didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: My father.",
        "A: My father was afraid that they \u2014 he will re \u2014 take revenge against him because he\nwas conducting that investigation. But there was none.",
        "A: He was \u2014 he was in Vilnius, he was doing his \u2014 communists were there, you\nknow, and whatever, and there was none. But there were some other people, you\nknow, who take revenge, mostly criminals.",
        "A: Who also thought, I mean, they might be \u2014 so, th-they had the problem there, but\nthis communist wasn\u2019t \u2014 he just ignored.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Which we did, yeah. I did, and my friends did. That was quite \u2014 nobody was\ndemonstrating nothing, nobody was walking around.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "A: No, not \u2014 not real communists. There were people, very leftists, you know,\nopinions, one \u2014 one \u2014 one \u2014 one doctor, he was a friend of the family. He was \u2014 he\nwas very leftist, but he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he was very favorable about the Soviet Union. He \u2014\nhe had very favorable opinion, but he wasn\u2019t communist, he wasn\u2019t working for the\nparty or anything like that, so.",
        "A: He became director of the \u2014 of the hospital.",
        "A: And then I think he expanded that hospital very well. He \u2014 he would \u2014 as \u2014 as a\ndoctor he was really, you know, valued under the system. But I \u2014 I su \u2014 suspect mo-\nmore than a doctor than \u2014 than a co \u2014 I don\u2019t think he was really a communist, even\nOctober 14, 2010\nafter \u2014 in particular after he saw, you know, the communism in \u2014 you know, in \u2014 in\nreal life.",
        "A: I was surprised, but I understood that there \u2014 there are communists, so we \u2014 we\nknew my father said that there [indecipherable] are the young, some young Jewish\npeople, the communists wi \u2014 1s popular between some young Jewish peop \u2014 men and\n\u2014 and la \u2014 and girls. So it wasn\u2019t really much of surprise. Still, 1t was a very small, I\nmean, there were thousands of Jews in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zZys. This \u2014 this group was small\ngroup, and apparently that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the limit at that time.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know exactly, I didn\u2019t follow them, and I went home, and then I got\nthe call, that Sauliai are called for duty. But what happened in between, except that\nthing the \u2014 our military, Lithuanian military officer telephoning the Soviets, that \u2014 I\nwas told about that, but I don\u2019t know exactly how it went, yeah.",
        "A: Well, demonstrations.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah, well \u2014 but those were officials, you know. The people had to go into\ndemonstrations. From their working places they were told that they better go, you\nknow, and there was a threat, unconcealed threat that si \u2014 they will take care of all\nthose who are against the people\u2019s government, as they say. And \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Beginning was the first \u2014 the intr \u2014 1-introduction of the military bases, that \u2014 that\nwas the first, and then the thing, you get \u2014 you get deeper. But that \u2014 that was the\nfirst.",
        "A: Yeah.\n100October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right. But even then, before that, go \u2014 with the World War going on, in particular\nw-with France collapsing, many people were thinking that Lithuania might not be\nable to survive as independent country. And there was a discussion going on, which\nis better, that the Germans would take over or the \u2014 or the Russians? Because Po-\nPoland wa-was gone, you know, was conquered by the \u2014 by both of them and\npartitioned. And I would say \u2014 I was inclined that it ba \u2014 may be better under the\nGermans, my opinion. Not very strong, but I was leaning that way. But th \u2014 I would\nsay the majority of Lithuanians we knew in \u2014 in the circle, were of the opinion that\nmaybe the Russians occupation would be more benign, because the Russians are not\nthat efficient, not that organized in our opinion.",
        "A: And \u2014 and Lithuanian nation would have a better chance to survive longer \u2014 long\ntime than under harsh and efficient German occupation. So even at that point, people\nwere leaning more toward the Russians than the Germans, more toward the Soviets.\nWell, the Russians they were call \u2014 calling at that time, until the occupation itself.",
        "A: That\u2019s difficult to say f-for me, I don\u2019t know. Maybe from the times of Taurag\u00e9,\ntheir culture were more familiar to me. And you know, we had very good German\nOctober 14, 2010\nteacher, even a g \u2014 a German, Lithuanian German in Panev\u00e9zys, and German\nculture, maybe made impression on me. I \u2014 I \u2014 I like \u2014 I read \u2014 I\u2014 I knew German\nlanguage fairly well. I started reading German books. Th \u2014 just that. It wasn\u2019t\nsomething very \u2014 very firm, you know, but I would say I was leaning that way.",
        "A: And the communist system somehow looked inefficient, distasteful. Thi \u2014 thi \u2014 I\n\u2014I didn\u2019t realize the amount of \u2014 of violence in the nationa \u2014 national soc \u2014\nsocialistic German [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t re-realize that much, than what I f\u2014\nlater found out. And the Soviets were pretty obvious. Once they came in, they were\nobvious. They wer \u2014 they we \u2014 they were threatening. They were not \u2014 not \u2014\npropaganda was before they came in.",
        "A: There was a lot of propaganda but they didn\u2019t care whether we believed or not \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because the main thing was the threat behind it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, they cared all the time, but I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you know, e-even being friendly\nto them didn\u2019t mean much, you know? Some ca \u2014 somehow \u2014\n102October 14, 2010",
        "A: Well, they started arresting people pretty soon, you know, I don\u2019t know, ma \u2014\nmaybe not the first week, but the second or third week, some of Lithuania\u2019s\nministers from the previous government were arrested and brou \u2014 and not arrested in\nLithuania, but arrested and brought to the Soviet Union. And then, just in about a\nmonth time, you know, the \u2014 a lot of people get arrested, including my director of\nour high school.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, he was arrested, I \u2014- a\u2014 a\u2014a good man, you know, we knew, and a\nlot of other people who were considered, you know, like leading in this society,\nhaving influence in the society. There were thousands arrested. And the thing, you\nknow, the \u2014 there was a prison in Panev\u00e9zys in the center of the city, built by the\ntsars, not far from the \u2014 our house. Our house was in the neighborhood of \u2014 of that\nprison. And right there, you know, the prison was \u2014 had bars in \u2014 in the windows.\nNow the bars stayed, but once the Russians came in, you know, they put like some\nboxes over the windows, so th-they couldn\u2019t see. Maybe they could see from the \u2014\none \u2014 from the top, the \u2014 the sun, some \u2014 some light, but they couldn\u2019t see anything\n103October 14, 2010\noutside. You know, even tho-those small things, you know, this \u2014 that \u2014 the prison\nnot good enough, they \u2014 they had to make it much \u2014 much worse, you know, to\nisolate people they couldn\u2019t see outside. Yeah, and pretty soon even the \u2014 from our \u2014\nfrom our gymnasium, from our \u2014 not from our class, but you know, they were\narrested, even \u2014 even the students.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Upperclassmen, yeah.",
        "A: Upperclassmen.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, one of them was active in that Daiteninkai(ph), that Christian Catholic\norganization, before \u2014 apparently therefore, he was arrested. Well, the resistance\nmovement started already, so that might be the things they \u2014 and they were not very\npar-particular to get exactly their man, you know. And 1f-if they wanted to get their\nman, you know, and they didn\u2019t know who it is, so they took 10 of them, thinking\n104October 14, 2010\nthat most likely one of them will be the \u2014 they are looking for. And that\u2019s it, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat was \u2014 pretty soon we found that that mattered, you know. The terror started\npretty soon. Not the first days, but pretty soon. And of course, everything changed.\nMy father lost his job. A lot of people were changed in \u2014 1n governing positions, 1n \u2014\neven in technical positions. So \u2014 but no-not only that, but a lot of people were losing\ntheir jobs and \u2014 in the government, and in administration. And everything that, you\nknow, made very oppressive [inaudible]",

        "A: July.",
        "A: July. June was just a half a month ba \u2014 two weeks left. June 15\" they took a \u2014\nmarched into Lithuania, 16\", so July. But fr \u2014 right from very beginning of July.\n105October 14, 2010",
        "A: Summer was easy because we went to the \u2014 on the vacation. Well, I \u2014 first of all,\nafter this incident in \u2014 in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9Zzys, when we had to enforce the commandant\u2019s\nhour, it was vacation time, as far as the school is concerned. So I went to my\nmother\u2019s farm, which was where she was come from, and her sister was there, you\nknow, running the farm with her husband. And so I went there, and I went there\nbecause I thought \u2014 I mean, this \u2014 this territory might be taken over by the Germans.\nThere were rumors you know, that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, since I preferred to stay wi-with the Germans, you know, I-I thought\nmaybe \u2014 now I found out th-that not \u2014 there was a division. The Germans were\ntaking \u2014 supposed to take over part of Lithuania there. But nobody knew exactly,\nyou know, where the \u2014 the dividing line would be. But eventually they didn\u2019t. The\nRussians took over the \u2014 the entire country. So, then they went back home and we\nwent on our regular vacation with our \u2014 my uncle in the \u2014 in the eastern Lithuania\nin that \u2014",
        "A: With the lakes, yeah.\n106October 14, 2010",
        "A: And wi-wi \u2014 and with \u2014 with the boat in the lake and all that. And it was a really\nquiet place. There was not much going. We heard on the radio, we read 1n the\nnewspapers all the changes going on in the country.",
        "A: Y-Yes, it all \u2014 officially some of them that still had old names, but obviously they\nwere run already by different people appointed by the new government. So it was a\nquite \u2014 we were \u2014 you know, we were disturbed what \u2014 about what it was happening,\nbut at that particular place, nothing much was happening. And people were all\nconcerned, everybody was tense. There was supposed to be elections to the people\u2019s\nparliament, where you know, there were exactly that many candidates as had to be\nelected deputies. People boy \u2014 boycotted th-that, or even if they voted, they drew,\nyou know, the cartoon characters instead of the bulletins inside. But that was about\nit, there \u2014 there was not much, and the meantime they annexed Lithuania. This \u2014\nthis parliament was called into the session and accepted the request\n[indecipherable] Lithuania would be included in the Soviet Union. And we were\nworking with my father in the forest, and came out of the forest into the small town,\nand we saw that there were some red flags out, and we asked \u2014 I mean, what\u2019s \u2014\nwhat\u2019s now? I mean, what\u2019s new? And there was a \u2014 a smith working at the edge of\nthe town, and we ask him, what \u2014 what\u2019s now, I mean, why \u2014 why the red flags here?\nSaid, well, they annexed \u2014 they annexed Moscow to Lithuania. So that was that,\n107October 14, 2010\nbecause they annexed \u2014 announced the annexation. So that was very upsetting, but in\nthat village not much was happening, until, you know, my vacation was over, I came\nback to Panev\u00e9zys, and Panev\u00e9zys there were changes, there were cha \u2014",
        "A: Well, even the Soviet placards ne \u2014 red, you know, flags everywhere, you know,\n[indecipherable]. Pretty soon my father was fired from his job, had to look for \u2014 for\ns \u2014 for some other job, finally found in a bank, as a clerk in a bank. Those \u2014 those\nthings, let\u2019s see, when \u2014 when did military took over? Part of our \u2014 yeah, I think at\nthat time, yeah, they \u2014 they were [indecipherable]. We were supposed to have that\nmuch living space, we had much more in our own house, so they took the rest of it,\nand put the s \u2014 the Soviet officers into our house.",

        "A: So th \u2014 and they had the small, small girl, and they stayed for quite awhile in our\n\u2014 in our house. And then another part of the house was taken over and one of the\ncommunist leaders, Lithuanian communist leaders were put in that part of the \u2014",
        "A: We knew about him, but we didn\u2019t know him personally.",
        "A: O-Oh th \u2014 oh, the officer himself, you know, th-the air force officer was a\nUkrainian. Very reserved, very reserved, very quiet. His wife was completely\ndifferent, very talkative, very expressive, liked to discuss things with \u2014 with \u2014 here in\nwith me with my poor Russian, which she corrected all the time. And, was very\nfriendly lady, very friendly lady yeah. And th-the \u2014 and the girl, you know, the small\ngirl, they \u2014 they \u2014 1t was difficult. He was in \u2014 in the d\u2014 on the duty, she was on the\nduty sometimes.

And that was strange for us, because that said, you know, y \u2014 y-you\ncannot live like this \u2014 this \u2014 I mean, you can\u2019t live like this, you have \u2014 you will go\nto Siberia, you have to prepare for that.\n109\nOctober 14, 2010",

        "A: Yeah, it was like [indecipherable]. Then she started talking about Ukrainian f-\nfamine. Now, my father said, well, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 nobo \u2014 nobody heard about that,\nyou know, and sh-sh-she might be a little bit, you know, she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s \u2014 you know,\nliving in fantasies, you know, so we \u2014 we just \u2014 we just discounted that, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 1t was obvious nonsense, you know, so who c \u2014 who \u2014",
        "A: Yes, 1940, yeah, yeah.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Not much. First of all, was completely obvious and natural that the Jewish\ncommunity was glad that Lith-Lithuania was not occupied by the Germans, and if it\nhad to go down, you know, it\u2019s better that the Russians took over. With that, many\nLithuanians would have agreed. But now, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we noticed\npretty soon the hostility against independent Lithuania, against the previous, not\nonly government, but the country itself. Now, it\u2019s very difficult to say how prev \u2014\nprev \u2014 prevalent this \u2014 this attitude was. There was definitely some, in particular in\nthe younger generation there. For us Lithuanians, was a gr-great surprise. We never\nthought that our relations are bad, we never thought that the Jewish people are\nsomehow disadvantaged in Lithuania or \u2014 or discriminated against. Yet, the\ncommunity was kind of separate, jewi \u2014 but we were \u2014 we were thinking and wer-\nwere convinced that that was the choice of the Jewish community. They wanted to\nhave their own schools, they wanted to have, of course, their religions and\nsynagogues and all that kind of thing, and their organizations. And we didn't mind,\nbut a lot of their life was separate from Lithuanian. There were some Jews which\nwere integrated into Lithuanian society, but there were very few of them.",
        "A: There were some \u2014 some doctors, s \u2014 in particular in \u2014 in professions. And now,\nyou see, I \u2014 since the Soviet terror became obvious quite soon, it 1s very difficult to\nsay. Those who were for the Soviet system became very loud. And they wanted to\nOctober 14, 2010\nmake, you know, career, to make a do \u2014 to \u2014 to advance in this new s \u2014 new society.\nSo they were a \u2014 loud, they were active, they were running around. They were\ntearing off the Lithuanian symbols, you know, from \u2014 from the houses or wherever\nthey were \u2014 they were. Those who were against them whether Lithuanian or Jewish\nor whatever, were kind of subdued. Because the terror was there, there was no sense\nstarting, you know, frankly, resisting that, or \u2014",
        "A: Openly, yeah.",
        "A: So those who were against that were quiet and tried to be, you know, not \u2014 not\nobvious, you know, with \u2014 with \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 their opinions there, so you know. So it\u2019s this \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to\nsay how much of Jewish communi \u2014 community were collaborating with the Sov \u2014\nSoviet occupation. But it \u2014 it was obvious that they were, because knew \u2014 officers\nknew \u2014 knew people with responsibility there, a lot of them were Jewish. Not all of\nthem, some of them were Lithuanian communists, but there were not that many\nLithuanian communists. All Lithuanian communists got good and significant\npositions at that time, tasks to do, but there weren't that many of them. And once\nthey ran out of them, also the Jewish people came in and there were \u2014 there were\nOctober 14, 2010\nmore of them, I-lot \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t know percentage-wise \u2014 in numbers wouldn\u2019t be\nmore, but percentage-wise definitely there were more Jewish collaborators than\nLithuanian collaborators with the Soviet government. There were also Russians. The\nRussians also was a split community because part of them were glad that, you know,\nthe Russians were taking over the country. Even the tsarist refugees from the tsarist\ngov \u2014 from the Soviet government, who fled to Lithuania said well, it\u2019s \u2014 th-they\nmight destroy us, you know, the Russians, who were against this \u2014 the Soviets, but\nit\u2019s still nice that the Russia is expanding again.",
        "A: Not a ma \u2014 to \u2014 1-1-1s \u2014 as somebody told to my father that, exactly.",
        "A: A\u2014a Russian he knew, you know, friendly. So \u2014 and so some of them\ncollaborated, but some of them, of course, also tried to just disappear from the view,\nso not to attract any attention, so that they wouldn\u2019t be, you know, repressed like\n[indecipherable] or the \u2014 of the government.",
        "A: Right.",

And I don\u2019t know, well luckily \u2014 so we \u2014 Uditta(ph)\nwas a wonderful girl, was a wonderful girl, we were dancing with her. I don\u2019t know,\nI didn\u2019t fell in love with her, but I admired her, definitely.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I s \u2014 I suppose just like other Jews were all \u2014 were rounded up\nand killed. I \u2014 although even my friends even now, when I talk with my c-class\nOctober 14, 2010\nfriends, cannot accept that fact, somehow say, well, maybe she s-somehow survived,\nbut there is no chance. There was no chance. He was terrif \u2014 she was terrified when\nthe war started, when the Germans attacked, and the Soviets. She was \u2014 we \u2014 I \u2014\nthat\u2019s the last time I met her, and a group of us met her, you know, she was terrified,\nshe \u2014",
        "A: Well, we were g \u2014 two or three of us, three of us, I think were \u2014 were running\nthrough Panev\u00e9zys, war already started, the Germans were bombing.",
        "A: Y-Yes.",
        "A: [indecipherable] war in Lithuania, yeah, the ger \u2014 the Germans attacked\nSoviets, and we were looking for weapons, we wanted to fight Soviets.",
        "A: We \u2014 we wanted to \u2014 since Lithuania didn\u2019t resist when it was occupied, we felt\nthat we just have a \u2014 Lithuania has a duty to, you know, to fight, to show that it\ndidn\u2019t accept that occupation, that we really want to be free, and really w \u2014 we were\nlooking for weapons, and didn\u2019t know where \u2014 where to find them. Previous\narrangements were broken down, you know, and so we were going there, and the j \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010\nwe just saw Uditta(ph) standing at the corner there, the ge \u2014 a German plane was\nturning circles around \u2014 around Panev\u00e9zys. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, right. Pretty high up, you know, the plane was there, the Russian officers\nwere shooting from their pistols, and that \u2014 1t was much too high to reach in the\nplane. And Uditta(ph) was also looking at that plane with terrified eyes. And we\nsaid, Uditta(ph), why are you afraid, I mean, you \u2014 you \u2014 you did nothing, you \u2014 you\nwere definitely \u2014 we didn\u2019t even conceive that the Germans would \u2014 what they did.\nWe couldn\u2019t conceive, we thought, I mean, it\u2019s a \u2014 it was a civilized nation, you\nknow, a nation of the western civilization. We \u2014 we didn\u2019t conceive that they \u2014\nsomething like that, that they would do, start killing the people all, you know,\nwithout any discrimination, nothing. We thought, I mean \u2014 well, those who worked\nfor the communists, those, you know, Jewish or not Jewish or Lithuanian or\nwhatever, they are in trouble definitely, but Jew \u2014 Uditta(ph), you know, that wa \u2014\nwho \u2014 who could choose her, you know?",
        "A: Nothing. We \u2014 we tried to tell her, you know, that there is no reason to be afraid,\nbut sh-she just listened and we saw that she \u2014 she just doesn\u2019t believe us, and she\nwas right. She was right. Yeah, I \u2014 I remember her, you know, I-I \u2014 I put \u2014 when \u2014\n117\nOctober 14, 2010\nwhen they were building this Holocaust Museum, you know, I \u2014 I asked, you know,\nthat her name would be inscribed in here.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, in a sense yes, yeah.",
        "A: Ina sense, yes, yeah. Although that was just symbolic, of course, Lithuania\ncouldn\u2019t de-defend itself, it was just too \u2014 too weak. The bases were inside already.\nBut still, I think they should have fought. They should have fought.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: No, 1-1- not the \u2014 not the bases. The bases somehow was accepted as in-in-\ninevitable. Estonia had that, Latvia had that, war was going on, you know, the\nsituation was unclear, how the war will develop was not clear. Somehow it looked\ntoo early to start and fight, you know, at that time. It \u2014 it looked like it\u2019s a right thing\nto play for time. And that was playing for time, but maybe we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re wrong. I\nmean, it would be much more effective fighting right \u2014 right there in 1939, but we\nwere not Finns, we were not that organized like Finns, so Lithuania couldn\u2019t bring\ndefend also, but would be more \u2014 would be more known, you know, would have\nattracted more attention in \u2014 in the world.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. Yeah, right.",
        "A: Yes.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Of course not, yeah, we didn\u2019t know at that time all the details. Now we \u2014 we find\nyou know, the documents, that memoirs, you know, we \u2014 we know \u2014 know much\nmore. So it \u2014 when I telling now the story, I have to watch myself to put myself in\nthat time, not what I know now about those \u2014 the things \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because I have read a lot of materials about those times, about negotiations,\nabout decisions being taken at that time. But at that time it looked like in 1939, was\ndistasteful and \u2014 and dangerous, but correct decision to accept the bases, playing for\ntime. But not resisting in 1940, it seemed like the really was \u2014 was, as I say, betrayal.\nIt was \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t a decision which could be justified, really. So when we were trying\nto fight the Soviets when the Germans attacked, it was desp \u2014 because Lithuania\ndidn\u2019t resist then, now we have to fight.",
        "A: Now we have to fight to show, you know, that we \u2014 we \u2014 we want to be free, we\ndon\u2019t want to be occupied by anybody.",
        "A: No, we don\u2019t want to \u2014 to be part of the Soviet Union, or of \u2014 of anything. No-\nNot of Poland, not for Germany. We want to be independent country. Our parents\nfo \u2014 our father fought for that, you know, and we want to have an independent\ncountry. That\u2019s \u2014 that was \u2014 that was the attitude.\n120October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 14, 2010\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: No, no. I think the Jewish, because several things. Russian community was so\nsmall that it was really insignificant. Our government, pretty \u2014 find out that there\nwas a split of opinion about that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military\ncommand. So \u2014 also, you know, difficult. Now, Jewish, proble \u2014 problem is that \u2014\nbecause maybe we were \u2014 or were \u2014 were mistaken, but we had the impression that\nthe Lithuanian Jewish relations are very good. That there is no ispy \u2014 th-there was\nsome Jewish communists, okay, you know \u2014 well, more than Lithuanian maybe,\n122October 14, 2010\npercentage-wise, but that was not really significant. The Jewish community\nsupported Lithuanians in the Vilnius question. They supported Lithuania\u2019s\nindependence, they \u2014 Smetona had very good relations with the Jewish community\u2019s\nleaders, you know? So we didn\u2019t see the reason why \u2014 we, as I said, maybe they felt\nbeing discriminated, because it was difficult for them, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 you know,\nto become officers in the army, in the police, and something like that. There was\nsome ethnic discrimination in Lithuania. But those who really wanted could, you\nknow, like Gensis(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian army, and very valued. So there",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Commandant \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. He was a Lithuanian officer from the time of the Wars\nof Independence. He became officer in the Lithuanian military school, and had a\nvery distinguished career in Lithuanian army, in the war with Poland. So, just one\nexample, there were other officers, Jewish officers in Lithuanian army. But benda \u2014\ngenerally, Lithuania being a small country, just established, and in big tr \u2014 big\nconflict with Poland, and with Germany because of Klaip\u00e9da, were looking \u2014 they\n123October 14, 2010\nwere discriminating not according to religion or race or anything like that, but about\nthe perceived loyalty to the state. The most discriminated people, of course, were\nPolish. They just didn\u2019t trust any Pole that he wouldn\u2019t be just a spy, you know,\nsomewhere. So, for pr \u2014 a Pole got a government sensitive position was practically\nimpossible. Then, of course, Jews, because of some communists in there, you know,\nin the younger, and because of some cus \u2014 cosmopolo \u2014 cosmopolitic approach. A\nsophisticated approach which Lithuania looked at them kind of s-such small,\nridiculous state, you know. They were yus \u2014 universal people, they \u2014 they were not \u2014\nnot that much ag-gainst Lithuania, but ri \u2014 but discounting Lithuania. And that also\nfor having some \u2014 somebody like that in military or police would seem I-like risky,\nyou know, h-h-he doesn\u2019t care about this country. So then, Germans. Lithuanian\nGermans ou-outside Klaip\u00e9da were mostly loyal, very loyal, just like I told about\nthat, you know, which I re-reme \u2014 remember in Taurag\u00e9, Greigoris(ph), who \u2014 who\nrefused even to \u2014 to go to Germany. And the same thing in Panev\u00e9zys, most of the\nGermans are loyal, but Germans still, you know, some. And then later, you know,\nthere were Tartars and Karayims, there were no discrimination whatsoever. Their \u2014\ntheir religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, Karayims had their own religion,\nJewish based, you know. The race, you can s-see Karayim, you know, you could\nsee from \u2014 from the face, from the features. Nim \u2014 Kara \u2014 Tartars not so much, was\nKarayims. But that didn't matter at all. Their people even in \u2014 in the army made the\n124October 14, 2010\ncareer, good career, you know. There were generals, Tartars, there were colonels,\nKarayims, you know. They were as good or better than Lithuanians, no \u2014 no\nproblem. So, the base of discrimination was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And is \u2014 being, you know, aware that we are \u2014 the country\nwas, you know, a small country, weak country in \u2014 in between dangerous other\ncountries. So that was one of the considerations, whether it \u2014 it was well taken or\nnot, you know, that\u2019s a different thing, but that was the basic feeling. And now,\nbasically, as I said, was the feeling that the Jewish community was a friendly\ncommunity and there were not really big conflict. There were some conflict in \u2014\ncommercial areas between Lithuania, but the government wasn\u2019t involved 1n that at\nall. Smetona\u2019s government was against any anti-Semitism at all. And \u2014 and the\npeople also, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\n125October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Most likely so. It\u2019s difficult for me to say th \u2014 because we\u2019re talking about the\ncircle, my circle, my \u2014 my parents \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 my dear friends, my friends, classmates, I didn\u2019t feel that.",
        "A: A-A-And all that circle, I din \u2014 didn\u2019t feel that. Yes, I knew there were some\nincidents, some 1-in between Lithuanian farmers and \u2014 and \u2014 and Jewish merchants,\nbut it \u2014 yeah, there were so, there was tension between Lithuanians coming into the\ncommercial area, trying to establish their businesses. There is a competition,\nsometimes this competition went out of bounds, you know, from both sides. The\n126October 14, 2010\nJews tried, you know, to establish some kind of mo-monopoly, and push out \u2014 that\nLithuanian out. Li-Lithuanian also, you know, appealing to some anti-se \u2014 anti-\nSemitic, you know, feelings. So, apparently there was, but I couldn\u2019t tell ma \u2014 much\nbecause it was way beyond my circle. In my circle that \u2014 this \u2014 this wasn\u2019t felt at all.",
        "A: Yeah, there were some \u2014 for instance, there were some \u2014 some Jewish families\nchanged their house language, their family language from Yiddish to Russian, and\nLithuanians resented that, you know, he \u2014 he \u2014 they give up Yiddish, why then don\u2019t\n\u2014 they don\u2019t pick up Lithuanian? And Y1-Yiddish didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t bother anybody,\nHebrew didn\u2019t bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know? But \u2014 but \u2014\nbut I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in Lithuanian. So there\nwere those who did that, you know, and w-went to Lithuanian language. Even in this\nmuseum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto her d \u2014 her diary in Lithuanian because\nshe \u2014 she ju-just didn\u2019t know ji \u2014 Yiddish that well. So, there were \u2014 it was \u2014 1t was a\nbig community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no \u2014 or not, but in the\npeople there was a sense of betrayal because they thought that the relations were\ngood, and they didn\u2019t see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way,\nor much of the community, in particular the younger generation. The older\ngeneration, of course, didn\u2019t partici \u2014 participate in \u2014 in that, but as I said, they just \u2014\nthey just were in \u2014 behind the picture, you know. Nobody cared much about the \u2014 the\n127October 14, 2010\nrabbis or something like that, how \u2014 how they look at the things. Now, I also write in\nmy memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our \u2014 our family\u2019s friend was Dr.\nBridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his\nspecialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also\ndoctors. And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of \u2014 the first Soviet\noccupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish\ncommunity leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this\nreaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active \u2014 well, pro \u2014\npro-communist, younger, active people and talked with them, and asked them not \u2014\nnot to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds\nof times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people\nthey are living between. Tried to be neutral, you know, and th-th-they e \u2014 taking\nsides, they couldn\u2019t have survived, because they would also, you know, provoke a\nlot of hostility. And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone\ndown. And they said the younger \u2014 the young people just lef \u2014 la \u2014 just laughed at\nthem. The old people they don\u2019t understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob-\nobsolete and \u2014 and didn't want even to listen to them. So apparently even in the\nJewish community, there was some perception that somebody is o-overdoing the\nthings. Now, was \u2014 as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you\nknow, they we \u2014 they were \u2014 they were 1-in \u2014 invisible, they tried to be-become\n128October 14, 2010\ninvisible. Now you asking about the period from \u2014 in early 1940s. Really the\nbreakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 1940, August, I think the third or fifth,\nabout that time. Right after the annexation, the thing changed. Now the terror\nintensified consid \u2014 considerably, and the resistance started getting organized. So\nnow, la \u2014 a lot of people, even in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and\nAr-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance. But even the [indecipherable]\nresistance, the people who were prominent in the \u2014 in the society generally, most of\nthem were arrested, th-thousands now. Now it became a mass thing. Now there was\nnationa \u2014 nationalization; the business establishments, commercial establishments,\nindustrial things were nationalized. I was my-myself, we \u2014 we s-students had to go\nthere, write, you know, in the \u2014 whatever belongs to that merchant establishment,\nand to be nationalized with the owners. Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian\nowner who owns some business or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or business establishment, they \u2014 they\nwere just thrown out. Now the Jewish, usually you know, still remain there as a\nspecialist. Just because usually there were some in the family, or in \u2014 1n their circle\nwho had influence with the new government. So apparently they tried, you know, to\nhelp each other. And pretty ba \u2014 became pretty obvious, you know, the things are\nnationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before. Of\ncourse now, in government\u2019s name, for \u2014 in government\u2019s account, Lithuanians are\njust without a job, you know, just \u2014 just waiting around. What\u2019s the matter, you\n129October 14, 2010\nknow, it\u2019s always the \u2014 these \u2014 these things started accumulating. The resentment\nagainst the Jewish reaction increased strongly. As the terror increased, increased the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the reaction. Also, because some of them, you know, even communist\nJews went into the security e-e-establishment.",
        "A: Well, they were visible.",
        "A: They went, they arrested people, they interrogated people, they \u2014 yeah, th-th-they\n\u2014 after annexation, everything became visible. Th-They \u2014 they didn't \u2014 the terror \u2014\nconcealed terror is not a terror. I mean, they \u2014 and then the terror really started after\nthe annexation. It really \u2014 what we suspected, what we were afraid, now, you know,\ncame to fruition. Now you didn\u2019t have to be afraid, you knew. You knew. That\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how it is. That\u2019s how it is, that\u2019s how it will be. And it \u2014 it \u2014 it gets stronger\nand stronger, more and more people arrested, until the big deportations.",
        "A: Well, it was in \u2014 1n \u2014 in naja \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly the date, but that\u2019s 1941,\nJune 14 maybe? About that, 14 - 13. Yeah, one night, you know, coming \u2014 well, in\n130October 14, 2010\nmy 0-op-opinion. We were walking with my father through Panev\u00e9zys. There was \u2014\nno, that was different, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s start of the war. Suddenly, you know,\nof \u2014 we \u2014 we got up one morning and saw that, you know, our friends are being \u2014\nbeing taking, arrested and being taking to the railroad station. I was working in the\nmiddle of the city, and I saw, you know, a \u2014 a\u2014 a truck going there, you know, an\nopen truck, and I saw, you know, the family we knew, who was my father\u2019s, really,\nsuperior for a time. We saw that family, the old \u2014 the old lady there, and their girl\nand him, you know, in that truck, and soldiers with the s-set bayonets around them,\nbeing taking to the railroad station. And \u2014 and a lot of people. Our teachers\ndisappeared, you know. Our teacher o-of the Russian language was a Lithuanian\ndiplomat, he was arrested, there was no Russian class there. He died from s-\nstarvation in Siberia. And so, you know, anybody could, there was no reason, there\n\u2014 pretty soon there was no reason \u2014 we couldn\u2019t detect the reason who is safe. Yeah,\nwell, the members of the communist party, and the \u2014 of the communist activists,\nthose who really contributed, who we-were working on the deportation, maybe they\nwere Safe, but nobody else. There was no, you know, anybody could be arrested,\nanybody could be deported.\nOctober 14, 2010\nto the train station? Wa \u2014 can you kind of draw us a picture? What was it that you\nsaw, and what you understood.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I didn\u2019t see too many because most of them went during the\nnighttime, and I don\u2019t know why this family was picked up \u2014 we-well, there were\nmore people, not only this family in the truck.",
        "A: But th-that was like after action actions, you know, something \u2014 people they\nmight \u2014 might missed or something.",
        "A: But pretty soon we knew, I mean th-the railroad station was full of people, you\nknow, the trains were full, and they were pushing those people, w-we \u2014 we knew,\nyou know.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I didn't. I-I didn\u2019t want to risk be \u2014 because I \u2014 we didn\u2019t know, w-\nwe didn\u2019t know \u2014 now we know, you know, aba \u2014 apparently how that was done, but\nat that time there was no \u2014 no understanding what was going on and woo \u2014 who is 1n\ndanger, who is not. My mother opened \u2014 and tr-tried to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to think what \u2014\nwhat we should take to go into Siberia, you know, now. And \u2014 and that was open\nbox, and she didn\u2019t put anything 1n th \u2014 she just \u2014 just was paralyzed, you know, and\nthat\u2019s it, you know, we don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know it \u2014 we were sho \u2014\n132October 14, 2010\nwe were shocked. We were shocked, we didn\u2019t expect anything like that. They were\nsaying, oh, your prostitutes are taking to \u2014 to Siberia, they will learn how to work.\nProstitutes, the \u2014 the kids, the families, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, but \u2014 but they were very rarely at home. Th-The ka \u2014 this \u2014 the red army\nwas on some kind of alert already, so they were mostly at their bases, wherever that\nwas.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we connected that. We connected. And we \u2014 particular the Russian\nliterature, the Soviet literature we had \u2014 we had to read, you know, some of the\nSholokhov\u2019s novels, and there is about de-deportations. And couldn\u2019t understand, I\nmean, so-some \u2014 some silly thing, some unrealistic thing. I mean, they come, they\narrest the farmers there, you know, they bring them to Siberia, but what for, I mean,\nwhat did they do, and the whole family? Why \u2014 why the whole family? If the farmer\ndid something wrong, you know, hm. We di-didn\u2019t understand. It \u2014 it looks kind of\nsilly to me, I \u2014 but then I remembered, then I remembered that \u2014 that \u2014 that day.\n133October 14, 2010",
        "A: Ye \u2014 oh \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on to \u2014 to the extent that oh, some of the\npeople we know, you know, when the \u2014 they came for them to be deported, the \u2014 the\nfather of the family, the man, ran away. He saw, you know, somebody coming, he\nthought they\u2019re coming to arrest him, because there were so many arrests, you\nknow? But n-not the families, there were people arrested, whoever was, you know,\nthey wanted to arrest. So they ran away and ha \u2014 hid, and their family was taken and\ndep \u2014 brought to the railroad station. Now, the man realizing that, came out, went to\nthe railroad station, and whatever happens, he wanted to be with his family. He\ndidn\u2019t realize that families were broken up, that the men were sent to concentration\ncamps, and the families were sent to the \u2014 to the Siberian farms and something like\nthat. So you see, even at the moment, people were so \u2014 that confused, didn\u2019t know,\nyou know, the method what was going on. So there was no sense for him because he\nwas \u2014 he wasn\u2019t let to go with his family.",
        "A: He was ta \u2014 oh, of course, yeah, he was taken, yeah. And very few survived there,\ni-in there, in particular the first deportation. But, as I say, we realized that the Jews\nare also being deported, yes, and quite \u2014 quite many of them.",
        "A: Well, we saw, I mean, people just disappearing all \u2014 all around you. Ma \u2014 my\nfriend Rubinsteinas(ph), his family. Our \u2014 our classmate Borokas(ph), his family,\n134October 14, 2010\nthey are deported. They were lucky. They were lucky, they didn\u2019t know. At that time\nwe were \u2014 thought it means how \u2014 how bad, how cruel, but they had 50 - 50 chance\nof survival in Siberia. My friend Rubinstein(ph) survived, and Borokas(ph)\nsurvived. They \u2014 they would \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether Borokas(ph) was visiting\nLithuania, you know, now, and Rubinstein(ph) I don\u2019t \u2014 he married local girl,\nstayed there in Russia. Whether he visited Lithuania, I don\u2019t know. And\n[indecipherable] but at that time it looked \u2014 the horror, the same horror as for the\nothers. But many Jewish activists were acting in that deportation. So, again, you\nknow, it should have been more. The \u2014 the people still didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t quite, you\nknow \u2014 just because Jews are being deported, didn\u2019t quite, you know, justify the\nwhole Jewish community because of that, because the activists still were there, you\nknow. Not the only ones, but there were quite a few of them, quite many. Clear\nmajority of the civilians taking care of that, except the Russian soldiers, of course.\nSo \u2014",
        "A: I would say so, I would say so. From what I hear, you know, they say the Jews,\nthe Jews, the Jews deported, you know, I don\u2019t know. I didn't take any samples or\nanything like that, but from what I heard, yeah, 1t seemed so. Well, majority was\nRussian soldiers.\n135October 14, 2010",
        "A: They were in each \u2014 in each group was one or two. Well, two, at least two,\nsometimes more.",
        "A: Well, they stopped for a \u2014 just few days.",
        "A: We- we have the feeling that it will resume, that \u2014 and \u2014 and that was right.\nLater we find out th-that the \u2014 they just \u2014 they just \u2014 system, you know, the railroads,\neverything, they had to make a break, and then they would have resume. So we had\nthe feeling that they \u2014 it will resume, but was just a days, and the Germans attacked.",
        "A: The war started for Lithuania June a \u2014 a\u2014 deportations started in June 14\", I\nwould say, so continued about three days more, maybe \u2014 no, it\u2019s three \u2014 well, 14, 15,\n16, maybe 17, I don\u2019t know. And 19, 20, oh yeah, and 22, June 22, the Germans\nattacked.",
        "A: Yeah, few \u2014 few \u2014 a\u2014a day after that, a day after that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I saw Uditta(ph).\n136October 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I remember. I was sleeping. I was sleeping. We \u2014 we graduated from\nour high school. There was supposed to be \u2014 no matter deportations, there was\nsupposed to be a picnic in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 1n Berchunai(ph), which 1s a resort near\nPanev\u00e9zys. We had to go that \u2014 that day, that Sunday. And suddenly there was a\nthunder, a very strong thunder, and I thought, my goodness, th-there goes the picnic,\nyou know, that is a thunderstorm. And then there was an explosion. I mean, I\nthought it\u2019s thunder, but somehow the sound came through the \u2014 through the ground,\nnot through the air. Such a strong that our small house, you know, just \u2014 just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 swayed.",
        "A: Ish \u2014no \u2014 stood up shock a-and went out outside to see what\u2019s going on. There\nwas no storm, there were no clouds. The sky was clear, and pani \u2014 Pajuoste were \u2014\nwas the military base behind Panev\u00e9zys, there was a huge cloud going up of the\nexplosion, apparently, huge cloud. And there were a lot of planes ou \u2014 in the sky, but\nthey were high up. Now, what\u2019s going on here, you know, something exploded in \u2014\nin \u2014 in \u2014 1n\u20141n Pajuoste, definitely. So \u2014 and then I saw, you know, it suddenly, I\nthink five planes came through, pretty low. Yellow s \u2014 this \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 yellow\n137October 14, 2010\nsigns and the black crosses, black \u2014 oh \u2014 oh, I knew the German military sign \u2014 1-\ninsignia. Black crosses, that was German military \u2014 military planes, black planes, so\nthat was clear. Five, in formation going there, you know, on \u2014 over Panev\u00e9zys. So\nthat \u2014 that was war.",
        "A: Then my mother came out, you know, and we started dancing, they are not going\nto defe \u2014 deport us to Siberia, see? War was salvation.",
        "A: For us, yeah, right. Yeah.",
        "A: There were a few days ca \u2014 went by, I came back from home, and we were \u2014 we\nwere \u2014 also dur \u2014 during the nighttime we went outside, there was a \u2014 a small\nbuilding, really without windows, so we thought rather a safe place, so we decided to\no-over \u2014 stay overnight there. And we heard, you know, we heard cars going on,\nmotorcycles, commands, but very difficult to say, commands in any language sounds\nsimilar. And suddenly a motorcycle went through our street very quickly. Most\nlikely it was already the German, but we stayed inside until morning, and in the\nmorning somebody come running and said, Germans are in the town.\n138October 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, Panev\u00e9zys were not that fast, yeah. Vilnius, Kaunas\n[indecipherable], it\u2019s surprising Vilnius was taken first, when \u2014 before Kaunas, and\nLithuanians rewa \u2014 you know, took over Vilnius even before Germans attacked.\nThen Kaunas the same thing. But Panev\u00e9zys was between the German armored\nattacks. It was not that important military center, so it came \u2014 I think it was 26\".\nWarsaw the 22, the re \u2014 Lithuanian insurrection started 23, and Panev\u00e9zys was\ntaken, I think, 26.",
        "A: Nothing much, the \u2014 because nobody had weapons, organization was broken\ndown by deportations.

One went to Kaunas, participated the \u2014 in the revolt\nthere. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, but \u2014 but nothing happened. We just didn\u2019t have anything, no \u2014 no weapons,\nno \u2014 well, organization was \u2014 we reestablished organization, but so what?\n139October 14, 2010",
        "A: So we \u2014 we just \u2014",
        "A: No, Soviets were there, so \u2014",
        "A: Until the 26\", yeah.",
        "A: Well, it is strange. There were moments when there were none.",
        "A: The Russians were \u2014 retreated, you know, somewhere, you know, and there was\nnone. And then the Russians again, came again.",

        "A: Th-They took off and \u2014 and the rest of the Russians took off, and there was the\ncity without an-any government. And then they realized that it\u2019s not true, so they\ncame back.",
        "A: There was terror, you know, they were \u2014 they were murdering \u2014 murdering\npeople at the factory, sugar factory, tens \u2014 tens of people, and there were those\ndoctors, surgeons, three surgeons and the nurse which were very cruelly murdered.\nWell, the terror was \u2014 in \u2014 in\u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",

        "A: No, no, w-we decided t \u2014 we didn't find any we-weapons, we didn\u2019t do anything\nuseful, so my friend and myself decided to go to a neighboring vil-village behind the\nOctober 14, 2010\ncity, and \u2014 to see may the \u2014 maybe there the Sauliai have hidden some weapons,\nmaybe so. So we went there, didn\u2019t find anything. Yeah, ba \u2014 the Soviet m-mili \u2014\nSoviet mi-military came upon, you know, and were ch \u2014 starting shooting at us, so\nwe ran away and hid. And we sit \u2014 sit there for two or three days, and then I decided\nto come back to Panev\u00e9zys, and I came back and the city was kind of dead. In \u2014 in\nthe early afternoon there were nobody watching the streets except the military patrol\n\u2014 patrols.",
        "A: Soviet, Soviet, yeah, so \u2014 so when I \u2014 when I saw them or heard them, I just made\na \u2014 a turnaround through other streets, you know, and came home, finally without \u2014\nwithout meeting any of them directly, face to face. Meanwhile, the prison was\nevacuated and many of the people were being killed at the sugar factory. But if \u2014",
        "A: No, sugar, sugar, sugar.",
        "A: Well, it was just apparently convenient place, I don\u2019t know, they just dig the \u2014 the\nditches and kill the people. They were mostly from \u2014 from other towns brought to\nPanev\u00e9zys.\n142October 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I would say so, yes.",

        "A: Trenches, yes. So he was not home, I was not home, my mother was home. So he\n\u2014 she \u2014 she thought that I might be arrested there, and they arrested. The NKVD\narrested a lot of young people in the streets, including my friends.",

So one of the neighbors brought a ladder, came over, you know, opened the \u2014\nthe gate, and went to the prison. Some of the prisoners were already breaking out\nfrom their cells, but it was very slow thing, so he showed where the keys are, and\nopened all the keys, and suddenly prison was empty. All this young people came out\ninto the neighboring houses, and meanwhile NK VD came back. They \u2014 they had\n143October 14, 2010\nsomebody guarding, and gave a signal that they are coming back, so everybody\ndisappeared and they came back to the empty \u2014 empty prison.

        "A: I realize that, you know, [indecipherable] from what I read, was completely\ndifferent in Kaunas. The Germans came in right there and started anti-Jewish\nactions right there involving Lithuanians. In Vilnius also pretty soon like that. But\nPanev\u00e9zys the Germans didn\u2019t care about anything except their military tasks,\nwhatever they had. And nobody attacked Jews until \u2014 until the funeral of the doctors\nand the other people who were killed by the Soviets.\n144October 14, 2010",
        "A: Why the doctors were killed is \u2014 1s \u2014 I\u2014 ou \u2014 nobody really understands.",
        "A: The doctors were operating on Soviet soldiers which were injured by the German\nbombing of Pajuoste. They were brought to the hospital and the doctors, the\nsurgeons were working on them, operating, and the nurse also, she \u2014 she works wi-\nwith the doctors. Now, somebody said that somebody broken into the hospital\nlooking for weapons, because the soldiers brought to the hospital, they thought\nmaybe they could get weapons there. Which is nonsense, nobody brought them with\nthe be \u2014 weapons. I mean, they were injured \u2014 injured soldiers, so they were brought\nto the hospital, the weapons stayed wherever they were serving. But I don\u2019t know\nhow much is rumor, how much is right, but in any case, there were some communist\nyouth guards in the hospital and they telephoned the security that somebody is trying\nto break into the hospital.",
        "A: Secret police, yeah. And then the secret police came, took the doctors, took the\nnurse and just \u2014 just killed them \u2014 not \u2014 not just shot, but really, you know, murder \u2014\nmurdered them to \u2014 to death, you know, by \u2014 by \u2014 by horrible, horrible torture.\nHow? It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s nonsense, I mean, the doctors, I d\u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\n145October 14, 2010",
        "A: I-It would \u2014 you see, the people \u2014 the people are most dangerous, and most cruel\nwhen they are very afraid. Russians were, at that time, they were afraid. They were\nsu-suddenly confronted with the German action, which was very powerful, and they\nwere afraid, they \u2014 they \u2014 they realized that all the surroundings are hostile to them,\nthe Lithuanian surroundings, so they were terrified. And terrified people are\ndangerous people, because they are irrational then, and they just \u2014 so-so that \u2014 that\u2019s\n\u2014 that\u2019s my observation from that. So I \u2014 that\u2019s how I can explain that, because there\nis \u2014 does \u2014 doesn\u2019t make any sense, there were n-no weapons in the \u2014 in the hospital\nand no possibility of the weapons [indecipherable] real, you know.

        "A: Oh, of course, yeah, then the funeral, bu-but not only the doctors, but also the\npeople, about I don\u2019t know, 20 - 30 people at the \u2014 at this sugar factory, various\npeople who were arrested by securities earlier. There, you know, in command, was\nthat Lithuanian communist who was living 1n our house. He was in command of that\nexecution.",
        "A: And th-there \u2014 there was different, there they \u2014 they were executing because they\nthought, I mean, this 1s anti-Soviet people.

Now, nobody until now, I never heard that\nanybody would men \u2014 mention that any Jew was involved in that.

After the funeral, I went [indecipherable] they said they are beating\nJews. Well, I went to see wha \u2014 where, you know, and really we saw it, you know,\nthe people were just standing and watching. And three, maybe four, most likely three\nburly men were hitting, you know, at the small houses there \u2014 there were Jewish s-\nstores, you know, several Jewish stores at that place. They were just breaking the\nwindows, the doors, you know, beating it up. And the people were just standing and\nwatching what\u2019s going on. Nobody said, you know, anything to them, to those three\npeop-people there. Obviously they were a \u2014 a \u2014 there were Jews there, you know,\n147October 14, 2010\nliving in there. And suddenly a man came out with a bl-bloody face, apparently a\nJew. And when the people saw the blood, you know, all this group of people who\nwere standing yo \u2014 just stepped back, you know, maybe three steps back and dis-\ndispersed right there. They were calling, you know, to join the people, but nobody\njoined them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but we \u2014 nobody joined, but no-nobody even objected to anything.",
        "A: No. Well, I think it was implied, condemnation. It was implied. People \u2014 people,\nbut \u2014",
        "A: They didn\u2019t say \u2014 they say \u2014 didn\u2019t say anything, yeah. And they just dispersed,\nand \u2014 obviously they were sent from somewhere, you know. Obviously some \u2014 some\n[indecipherable] tha-that was not s \u2014 anything spontaneous. But \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.\n148October 14, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, not a coincidence, but a \u2014 somebody wanted to establish a relationship, which\nwasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: Since nobody appro \u2014 nobody co \u2014 even \u2014 even from the [indecipherable]\nnobody accused that Jews were involved. In other places there were such a \u2014 such\naccusations, I read, but not in Panev\u00e9zys. Until now, nobody mentions that any Jew\nwas involved in those actions, doctors or sugar fac \u2014 factory, no. So apparently\nsomebody want to make a connection, sent those three men there, you know, maybe\npaid them, and tried to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in-insight them. I don\u2019t know. Not as \u2014 as far as me is concerned, but I don\u2019t\nknow about the other people. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think that even after that,\nnobody \u2014 nobody talked ab-about the Jews in connection with that \u2014 with those br \u2014\n149October 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 those incidents, yeah. So \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Oh no, several days after that.",
        "A: Several days after that, I don\u2019t know how many \u2014 you know, two or \u2014 two \u2014 at\nleast two, maybe three days after that, because the Germans had time to bring\nforeign journalists from Berlin by plane, they brought to Panev\u00e9zys to show the\njournalists what the Russians have done.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So, a-and the journalists, even American journalists were there because America\nwas not in war at that time yet with Germany. American and Swiss, Swedish. And I\nknow about that story because there was one Lithuanian from Klaip\u00e9dos, Klaip\u00e9da\n150October 14, 2010\narea. He was very much anti-German, his whole life anti-German, but he knew\nlanguages, and he \u2014 he was a refugee when the Germans took over Klaip\u00e9da, he\nlived in Panev\u00e9zys. But he was kind of drafted, or asked as a translator for the\njournalists. Journalists knew German, but not the real Lithuanian kn-knew German\ngood enough.",
        "A: And he knew. So, the Germans brought them to those doctors and others and\nshowed the places, and then later there was kind of like, I don\u2019t know, like place for\n\u2014 for them to wait until the plane was ready to take them back. And this Lithuanian\ntranslator whom I \u2014 who \u2014 was also our family friend, so he was telling us that one\nof the American journalists took him away and said, look, you know, this, all those\nkilled people, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what the Germans did, didn\u2019t they? He said no, no, no,\nthat \u2014 that was Soviets. Oh, he says, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s clear, that\u2019s clear, thank you. And\nthen he wanted to \u2014 to \u2014 to talk with him and the American wouldn\u2019t talk with him at\nall. So the German propaganda didn\u2019t take, I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 that \u2014 at least this\njournalist was convinced that was a German \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 action. And this, from \u2014 from Klaip\u00e9da, who all his life was fighting against\nthe Germans, and e-even until \u2014 he always was, even after that inc \u2014 incident, but \u2014\nbut he was upset about the \u2014 th-the western prejudices.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Right, right. Well, apparently he was convinced that the Russians don\u2019t do such\nthings, nome \u2014 and the Germans do. Which is true as \u2014 as far as the Germans are\nconcerned, just the first \u2014 just the first part not \u2014 not true.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, horribly, because there were a lot of killing. Revenge killing.",
        "A: People, you know, ju-just under suspicion that somebody was in the communist\nyouth organization or something, were taken out and shot, without any 1-inquiry,\nwithout any court, without any pro-procedure, just like that, you know, and a lot of\ninnocent people were just killed, like this \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys and in surrounding\nvillages, like that. It was terrible. Some of them were Jewish, I don\u2019t know how\nmany of those, but definitely just some \u2014 some Jews were killed. Some Lithuanians,\nsome Russians, whatever.\n152October 14, 2010",
        "A: I would say without.",
        "A: Ja\u2014 that was just Lithuanian project.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not a project, there was a staff, you know, just when the Germans marched\n\u2014 marched in, I saw the Germans right there, you know, at my gymnasium, and the\ngirls were, you know, greeting them with flowers and \u2014 and milk and water and\n[indecipherable] you know [indecipherable] and one of our classmates who ran\naway to Germany was \u2014 I didn\u2019t see him, but he went by, you know, he was drafted\nby Germans as translator, going through Lithuania. So we \u2014 Lithuanian flags\neverywhere. The only German flag under their military establishment, and even that\nflag was a war flag, not the regular German flag.",
        "A: So, according to that, that\u2019s kind of correct, I mean, that\u2019s the army. They don\u2019t\nclaim that \u2014 that city or that part. So \u2014 and there was a staff, Lithuanian staff is \u2014\nthey said, I went there, you know, and so \u2014 volunteered for 1n \u2014 ins \u2014 in service there.\nThey gave me a \u2014 arifle, the automatic Russian \u2014 automatic rifle, ammunition, and a\n\u2014a-\u2014how do you call it, armband.\n153October 14, 2010",
        "A: It \u20141it identify \u2014 pardon me?",
        "A: It was red.",
        "A: What was surprising, but there were signs, you know, ah-ah-ah-ah \u2014 was ga \u2014 was\na red \u2014 up in the red material or something. In Panev\u00e9zys it was red, but it was \u2014 it\nhad insignias, it \u2014 different insignia. And that\u2019s it, we went into th \u2014 into the service\nthere.",
        "A: Apparently some from our service were killing people, apparently. I don\u2019t know,\nafter that, whe-when they were killing, apparently they felt like big heroes, you\nknow. Like \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, killing communists.",
        "A: Communists. J-Jews weren\u2019t \u2014 at that point wer \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 I am not sure,\nbut I don\u2019t think they were killed just because they were Jews. They suspected they\nare communists, that\u2019s \u2014 something like that. Anyway, not the families \u2014\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: They were sa \u2014 yes, well, the lower, ba \u2014 ba \u2014 could be \u2014 could be higher than\nthat, too. In their 20s something, up to 26 - 27 maybe. Something like that. So, pretty\nsoon, you know, the people in \u2014 in Panev\u00e9zys were very concerned about that, that\ninnocent people are being killed, so they had contacted the leadership of that staff,\nand you know, said \u2014 and then, you know, the \u2014 the staff \u2014 staff was responsible,\nthey get weapons. Th-Th-They have those armbands. So after that they stopped this\nthing.",
        "A: Well, my first duty, or first thing, we \u2014 they \u2014 they send me to Pajuoste together\nwith others in \u2014 in \u2014 1n a truck, to pick up the ammunition. There was a lot of\nammunition, loose ammunition in Pajuoste. So, we went there and took the \u2014 those\nheavy boxes of ammunition in the truck, and brought to the staff.",
        "A: No, no, that before, that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Th-That was before.\n155October 14, 2010",
        "A: And \u2014 okay, then \u2014 then we se \u2014 wait, we went back, second time. Second time\nwhen we back, Germans \u2014 German soldiers were there, they just looked. Wh-What\nare you doing, you know, here? We s \u2014 we said we have, you know, the instructions\nfrom our staff to take ammunition. Out. Out of here, no ammunition, nothing. Well,\nout, okay. So we went back to staff, said to them, and Germans didn\u2019t let us pick up\nany more. Okay. So then tol \u2014 they told me to take a group of my friends and go and\nsee the \u2014 there 1s a report that some communists, or maybe even Russian soldiers,\nstraggling soldiers are in a big building, Meistas(ph) factory, or a\u2014 a b \u2014 a building,\nthat they might be hiding there.",
        "A: Check that. Okay, I go with my f\u2014 my \u2014 my men in there, you know, to check\nthat, and well, the building is high, hm. There are very few windows, only very high\nup. Well, we started approaching the building, everybody just coming together, I\nsaid no, I mean, if they was going to shoot, you know, they got us all, so just spread,\njust spread. And we approaching the building and then the German comes in, the\nGerman sergeant and asks, who is in charge of this thing? They \u2014 so \u2014 so me, you\nknow? He co \u2014 approached me and said, hey, what\u2019s going on, what \u2014 what war are\nyou fighting here? Well, what war? Well, I patiently explained to him that I have\ninstructions, something [indecipherable] report there about something like that. Out.\n156October 14, 2010\nI \u2014 I am taking over this duty, I will take care of that. So, we wanted to stay and take\na look, you know, how \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 how he takes care of it. No, he didn\u2019t let us, you know. He just chased us away.\nWell, going to staff, reporting another, you know, no \u2014 no success there. Okay, so\nanother reports. Some communists may be in some other building. Okay, we go to\nanother building. Well, it\u2019s a small, small house, small wooden \u2014 not a shack really,\na house, but it\u2019s a small one \u2014 one \u2014 one store building. Well, the report is that the\ncommunists are th \u2014 a-are there, you know, or \u2014 or the activists there. Looking, no\nnothing \u2014 nothing happening in there. So he said well, somebody, a volunteer is\ngoing inside to see what\u2019s going on. No volunteers. No volunteers, well, what do we\ndo? You \u2014 you can\u2019t wait until the night, so I\u2019m suppose \u2014 then I\u2019m going there.\nOkay, go inside, kick in the door, you know, the door not locked, opens. I thought\nmaybe somebody will throw grenade or \u2014 or \u2014 or shoot, but there was nobody inside,\nempty. But there was something, the [indecipherable] was not quite, some \u2014\nsomebody \u2014 there was food, there were things, somebody left it in very big haste.",
        "A: Yeah, definitely there was something, but at that time there were nothing, empty.\nOkay, I'll come back, report that, nothing there. So they send me, alone now, report\nthat a \u2014 a Jewish communist killed himself, shot himself. Go there and see what\u2019s \u2014\n157October 14, 2010\nwhat \u2014 about that report. Okay, I go there, in the center of the city, and go, a famil \u2014\nan old people, fam \u2014 family living there, a very nice, old man and old woman living\nin a small apartment, very nice, very tidy. Very scared people. I asked about that,\nyes, there is somebody died, you know, in \u2014 1n \u2014 in the \u2014 1n a shed outside. Outs \u2014 so\nI went into the shed, yes, there is a man, you know, who apparently killed himself,\nbecause his pistol was right there, you know, and a lot of money, Russian, Soviet\nmoney. And a s \u2014a small piece of paper, you know, with scribbled writing, but not\nLithuanian, apparently Yiddish. So I looked at, he \u2014 he was dead, definitely.

        "A: In the head. Yeah, he shot himself in the head.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 the only corpses I have seen before, and a f \u2014 few of them were during the\nfunerals, during the wake. But also very few of them. But \u2014",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. But at that time, you know, there was so many dangers we went through,\nthat it didn\u2019t affect me very much. I took it as a fact, was just the man killed himself.\nI \u2014 I have a task here now, to \u2014",
        "A: Y-Young man, not gray, dark hair. I would say in \u2014 1n his 30s, maybe. Okay, so I\ntake his weapon, his \u2014 his pistol, his \u2014 his \u2014 my \u2014 the money, and the \u2014 the s \u2014 the\nnote and went back to the old Jewish couple, and asked them to translate for me this\n\u2014 this note. They did, I scribbled out the translation, and he said that, you know, I am\n\u2014 he 1s \u2014 he always was a communist, believed in communism and now he\u2019s dying\nfor the communist [indecipherable] and something like long live Stalin, or\nsomething like that.

But \u2014 nothing, you know, don\u2019t \u2014\ndon\u2019t worry, you know. Oh \u2014 and the Germans are marching, you know, through the\n159\nOctober 14, 2010\nwindows you can see artillery going, you know, all \u2014 all the German \u2014 German\nthing. Well, what the \u2014 I \u2014 I really believed \u2014 I really believed that they are in no\ndanger whatsoever, just like Uditta(ph).

        "A: Right.",
        "A: I think so. I think h-he might have been th-their son, or \u2014 or a close relative, but I\n\u2014I[ didn\u2019t enquire that, and I thought, you know \u2014",

        "A: Task.",
        "A: My headquarters, gave the pistol, the am-ammunition, gave the money, gave the\nnote and the translation, and that was a day\u2019s work done. So went back home with\nmy friends, and my father met us with the \u2014 a toast for a free and independent\nLithuania, which we thought it\u2019s being established now, because all the city was\nOctober 14, 2010\njust in Lithuanian national colors, and the flags, except for one building where the\nGerman commandant was \u2014 took over the place. So \u2014 so tha \u2014 at that pla \u2014 what we\nthought is going \u2014 going to happen, there will be, well maybe not quite independent,\nbut something like Hungary, or \u2014 or Slovakia, something like that, you know, that\nwe will \u2014 will be independent country together with \u2014 with Germany, you know,\nallied willingly or not. And then the other day, I went to the police, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, do-don\u2019t remember exactly, went to the police, and \u2014 but I remember the view,\nwhich was very shocking to me. There was an old man, apparently a Jew, an old\nman, you know, and he was standing like in the corner, and on his forehead was\nwritten in, I would say maybe it looked like wet ashes, you know, make something\nlike that and then smear on that, and it was called Zydas.",
        "A: In Lithuanian.",
        "A: Jew.",
        "A: And he was inside the police station, was standing in the corner, the people were\ngoing around their business there, you know, nobody was paying any attention to\nhim as far as I could see. I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I just left that police and j-just stays in my\n162October 14, 2010\nmemory, you know, bec-because it was such a shocking, shocking view for me, for\nme.",
        "A: No, he was small, he was bald, yeah. That \u2014 that \u2014 that was very shocking to me,\nthat\u2019s why I remember it. Well, I went back home, then didn\u2019t have any di \u2014 nothing\nwhen I went to staff, they had nothing for me for awhile. We met some Germans, we\ndrank with them. My school German became conversational, but my \u2014 when we are\n\u2014 get drunk, you don\u2019t have inhibitions, so it\u2019s mech \u2014 much earlier \u2014 easier to learn.\nThe Germans were very friendly, the soldiers. They were \u2014 they were soldiers, that\u2019s\nall they c-cared, you know, they wer \u2014 they were fighting their \u2014 the war, and no\npolitics, nothing her-here. They were friendly people. Now, another day I went, and\nthey had another task to me. And the Russians \u2014 the railroad was a regular western\nEuropean railroad in Lithuania, the width. The Russian railroads had different\nwidth. So when the Russians took over, they made a more wide, you know, on the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the Russian \u2014 a Russian standard. Now, the Germans wanted us to bring it back\nto the west European, German, or previous Lithuanian standard. So I had to \u2014 to \u2014 to\ngo to the prison. There was prisoners of war, Russians, Soviets, you know,\nUkrainians, whatever. I had to take 120 - 150 of them and bring to the railroad, and\n163October 14, 2010\nlet them work on the railroad bringing the \u2014 the \u2014 the rail width to the regular side.\nAnd, to watch what \u2014 with my friends also, to watch them, you know, working there.\nSo that\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: We guarded them, yeah.",
        "A: And they were \u2014 they were working there. It was easy \u2014 well, of course, not very\neasy, easy because th-there were, you know, before, that width, so it was just re-\nreturn to the old place. And it was narrower, so it\u2019s no problem, n-no \u2014 no \u2014 no need\nto extend anything or something. But, you know, the rails are heavy, you have to \u2014 to\nlift them and bring it, and so \u2014 so it was w-work, you know [indecipherable] many\nof them. Now, I was the control. The Ukrainians were very happy people there. They\nwere, you know, full of fun, you know, they \u2014 they had all kinds of funny stories,\nand I s-started, you know, to talk with them.",
        "A: In Russian, yeah. They said, you know, all \u2014 they were all happy. They knew the\nwar was over, will be over in months, they go back to free Ukraine, everything will\nbe just fine. And I saw that I lost, I mean, you know, a war discipline, they \u2014 they are\nnot working, they are just entertaining me. So, I had problem, you know, until I\n[indecipherable] on them to work. The Russians were very up \u2014 not very, but they\n164October 14, 2010\nare upset, sad, you know. They were working, but obviously they \u2014 they \u2014 they were\nnot happy, not like Ukrainians, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a very big difference between. There were\nother nationalities. There was one of them, they knew no Russian.",
        "A: It was a Soviet soldier, he was from Kaukas(ph) or somewhere, th-the Russians\ntold me, he is from Kaukas(ph), so he doesn\u2019t know any Russian. Yeah, so I don\u2019t\nknow who he was, but di \u2014 you showed to him, he-he did, you know, whatever. They\nnever \u2014 I wa \u2014 I never asked them, but they never complained, th-they \u2014 I never\nasked how they are fed or something like that, but apparently there were no problem,\nbecause nobody complained to me that they didn't have hot food or anything.",
        "A: They look alright to me. There 1s just a few days \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they became p-prisoners of war. They were under Lithuanians, not under the\nGerman rule. The Germans some \u2014 somehow, you know, they are supposed to be\nunder the Germans, you know, but they were under the Lithuanians. So they working\nseveral days, we were working at that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s rail \u2014 rail somehow is re-established\nthe \u2014 the discipline with \u2014 with a difficulty with my Ukrainian friends. And finally, it\nwas going fr \u2014 really fast, you know, the \u2014 the work was done, some distance from\nPanev\u00e9zys, and that was done, you know, my task was finished, I \u2014 back to the staff,\n165\nOctober 14, 2010\ngave back the rifle, the ammunition, the armband, was done. Went home. My\nparticipation in the second World War was complete, without the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, without point. Let me tell you, at that point \u2014 without \u2014 without \u2014 without\nany shot being fired from my gun, I \u2014 I didn't \u2014 didn\u2019t have any \u2014 no need, no\nopportunity. I wasn\u2019t in any fi-fighting in the action, nothing. So I came back home\nand just was waiting until the Lithuanian army will be reestablished, we will be\nmobilized and we\u2019 ll be sent to fight the \u2014 the Soviets together with the Germans, just\nlike Finns, like Hungarians, Italians, Bulgarians are doing. So that was the big\nillusion, you know, and no \u2014 no Germans didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t want any \u2014 any of our\nservices, and \u2014 of Lithuania\u2019s service. Now, as far as the Jews are concerned, until\nthat, you know, nothing happened except for those p-previ \u2014 early executions. The\nearly executions, of some of the com \u2014 my communist friends, you know, that \u2014 who\nwere in the communist youth organization, fled together with the Soviet army when\nthe Germans approached Panev\u00e9zys.",
        "A: Yeah, they were from my class, well, what can you do? So, yeah, th-the two of\nthem were killed, you know, there in action, you know, against the German. They\ntried to attack a German tank, and they were killed. But the others retreated together\n166October 14, 2010\nwith the \u2014 some communists with the si \u2014 this communist who lived 1n our house and\nwho was participating 1n executions at the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 sugar factory. And th-those come \u2014 those communist youth people, they \u2014 they\ngot rifles, they were \u2014 had weapons, and they were f-fleeing together with the red\narmy, retreating. The Germans, well, you need map really. The Germans went one\nway from K-Kaunas to Dofilis(ph) in Latvia, Pskov in Russia, directly towards\nSaint Peterburg; Leningrad, at that time.",
        "A: But one f\u2014 another was big \u2014 big move from Pilzzeit(ph) to Taurag\u00e9, Siauliai,\n[indecipherable] Riga, and farther away into Estonia. And Panev\u00e9zys is in\nbetween. So they were fleeing toward north, not toward the east. Of course, toward\nthe east the Germans were already advancing there. They fled to \u2014 reached Latvia,\nJ\u00e9kabpils, which is on the Daugava river. And so that on the other side of Daugava\nare \u2014 the German tanks are going. Apparently \u2014 the communists apparently, for\ninstance, this communist who lived in our house, de \u2014 he survived. He \u2014 he e \u2014 he\nescaped.",
        "A: He escaped, because he later was parachuted into Lithuania, caught by the\nGermans and \u2014 and hanged by the Germans. And so he \u2014 he escaped, but then of\n167October 14, 2010\ncourse was thrown back as a paratrooper. But my f \u2014 but the young friends from the\ncommunist youth thought it\u2019s \u2014 1t\u2019s hopeless. They said that they threw their rifles\ninto the Daugava river, and walked back to Panev\u00e9zys. Well, it took couple of\nweeks, I guess, until they arrived back. Nobody was interested, nobody bothered\nthem, nobody enquired about them, nothing. If they wouldn\u2019t have fled, they would\nhave shot. They would have killed.",
        "A: The first \u2014 first day, yeah. Such people like them, they were killed first day, no\nquestions asked. What a difference two weeks made. Nobody was interested, nobody\neven asked them where they were.",
        "A: Or who they were, yeah. They lived just normal life. One of them\u2019s living in\nKlaip\u00e9da now, raising his family, that\u2019s \u2014 he was Russian, yeah, ethnic Russian.\nYeah, so.",
        "A: Not a single shot.",
        "A: Right.\n168October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s the problem. I think when they were killing the people, they thought\nthey doing some kind of a heraic \u2014 heroic work. But they very quickly found out\nthat everybody looks very, you know, agains \u2014 ev-everybody\u2019s we \u2014 very much\nagainst that, and they condemned such a t \u2014 such a action. So they didn\u2019t brag about\nthat any more, and so I just heard the rumors, yeah, from my class, about one, yes,\nbut it\u2019s a rumor, he never talked about anything like that, so I\u2014 I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t\naccuse him, because this 1s terrible accusation, and well, he is killed. H-He 1s killed\nby the \u2014 by the s \u2014 by the Soviets, but \u2014 on second occupation, he \u2014 they found his\nremains in ter \u2014 what does \u2014 near Vilnius there, the burial place. But \u2014 but I don\u2019t\nknow. Just a rumor about him.",
        "A: I imagine that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s killing of the communists.",
        "A: Yeah. Jews and not Jews. Definitely not Jews, because we know, I mean, who are\nkilled. As far as Jews are concerned, we didn\u2019t have that many people so we identify,\nyou know, how many and where. I sa \u2014 would suspect that the Jews had the worst\n169October 14, 2010\nchance to survive in the \u2014 than the Lithuanian communists. Well, Lithua \u2014 be \u2014 if\nthey decided to kill, I mean, there was no chance any more. You know, they decide,\nthis is a communist, let\u2019s shoot him. And they shot \u2014 shot him. But I think they had\nstupid errors, you know, of killing people who were not communists, could happen\nfor the Jews much easier, because \u2014",
        "A: Sus-Suspicion and not knowing the community that well. In Lithuanian case\npretty much well \u2014 was known who was, you know, wa \u2014 involved that much. So I\nsuspect that maybe more Jews. But anyway, they were not killed, there were not\nmass executions like later. There were not executions of children, women. Well,\nwomen, unless they themselves were implicated, but \u2014 but not like, you know, the\nwhole families or something like that. Just \u2014 just thought he\u2019s a communist, a Jew a\ncommunist, we\u2019ll kill him, kill him. That\u2019s my impression. I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t close to those\nthings, I saw \u2014 well, it\u2019s difficult to say, but it was definitely not \u2014 not a mass ex \u2014\nextermination of the Jews \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at that point, yet.\n170October 14, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, that\u2019s another story. Since \u2014 you know, it became a pr \u2014 as far as I\nwas concerned, became a quiet time, you know, no \u2014 no \u2014 no service in the \u2014 in the\nmi \u2014 of military or police or anything like that, I through with that.",
        "A: You're finished with high school. So my friend from my \u2014 from my s \u2014 class,\nasked me to come to the village to be a guest in his sister\u2019s \u2014 sister\u2019s ba \u2014 wedding.\nAnd so we went, I went with \u2014 to my \u2014 near \u2014 near Birzai, his \u2014 his village, and\nthere was a very si\u2014 big wedding, you know, a lot of Birzai beer, which is very\ngood, very, you know, homemade. Fine, so we celebrated there. Now, after that, he\ndecided to show me the Birzai and the \u2014 and the area around, area where he was\nborn and grown and he wanted to show me. Well we went to Birzai, went, met the\ngirls there, was nice. And the last day before I-I came home, we were walking\nthrough his village. There were no buildings around, there were fields and roads, and\nthere came a man on a bicycle. And this man came to a \u2014 both of us and said, do you\nknow? Birzai Jews are \u2014 have been killed. We were shocked, I mean, wha-what \u2014\nwhat do you mean? He didn\u2019t say hello or anything like that, that was the first words\nhe said, do you know?",
        "A: Total stranger. Do you know the Birzai Jews were killed? No. We were \u2014 we\nwere shocked. And he started telling, he \u2014 he just had to tell that the German\n171October 14, 2010\ncommandant, the German military said \u2014 the Jews were in the ghetto already. He\nsaid that they found, the Germans found that the Jews had hidden weapons, and\nbecause of that, you know, he t \u2014 took all the Jews, and brought to someplace, you\nknow, outside the city, and they just killed all the Jews. All, he said. Children,\nbabies. The German officer was walking around and shooting babies in the mothers\u2019\nhands. Whether he participated or not, I don\u2019t know, but he was shocked. At least he\nwas apparently guarding, or so. He was \u2014 he \u2014 eyewitness. No question about that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I \u2014",
        "A: He \u2014 well, yeah, he was telling with details everything what was going on. He\nwas telling about the doctor who was not brought to the \u2014 he was so m \u2014 valued that\nthey didn\u2019t bring him to the \u2014 the ghetto, he still stayed at his home and his office.\nAnd the Germans came to pick him up and bring with the other Jews, and he said no,\nhe is not going anywhere. And the \u2014 well, the German officer pulled out the pistol\nand just shot him right there in his office. And thi-this is \u2014 they said, I mean, they\njust put him in \u2014 1n the truck and brought to the execution place and threw in with\nOctober 14, 2010\nthe others. And he \u2014 he described the execution in great detail. He said, the ra \u2014 re \u2014\nGermans were killing, Lithuanians were killing also there, the \u2014 those Jews, you\nknow, and he \u2014 he told him particularly he \u2014 the ch \u2014 the killing of the babies for him\nyou \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 was the thing, I mean, he just couldn\u2019t \u2014 he said, after that, I\nmean, he \u2014 he just resigned from \u2014 from the service, and he doesn\u2019t want even to see.",
        "A: Well, like auxiliary policeman at that time, not a regular in uniform or anything\nlike that, no. Tho-Those are \u2014 were not involved in \u2014 in \u2014 1n usually in \u2014 in Jews\u2019\nexecution. But that was \u2014 we were shocked also, hearing that. And we thought that\u2019s\n\u2014 it\u2019s a unique thing, as I read in Napoleon\u2019s biography right before going there, you\nknow. Th \u2014 having time I just picked up a book and read Napoleon\u2019s biography.\nAnd there is an incident where Napoleon killed the prisoners of war in \u2014 in\nAkah(ph), in \u2014 in \u2014 today Israel, at that time Turkish Palestine. And even, I\nthought, I mean, even \u2014 even Napoleon, whe \u2014 really a reasonable military leader, he\ndid things, and I thought well, BirZai will be also in history like Jaffa, you know,\nsome cruelty which happens during the war, you know, without any reason,\nsomething \u2014 well, what do you mean, I mean Jews were hiding weapons. Maybe\nthey were hiding weapons, but somebody prepared even the ditches for the \u2014 for the\n\u2014 for th \u2014 for them to be killed, you know, before that. So s \u2014 must be just \u2014 just a\npretense. So, we \u2014 we thought that something what\u2019s ha \u2014 what\u2019s happened in\n173October 14, 2010\nBirzai, the \u2014 we \u2014 I went back to Panev\u00e9zys, you know, and then I found out no, this\nthing is going all around. And then we found out not only in Lithuania but in\nLatvia also. Hm. Now \u2014 then we [indecipherable] we saw, in our gymnasium, in\nou-our high school came a German detachment, not the regular military, I don\u2019t\nknow, the uniforms were somewhat different, they have digging equipment a lot, and\nthere was \u2014 they will kill Panev\u00e9zys Jews also, the rumor was there. And of course\nwe believed because we knew what happened in BirZai. It was terrible. By the way,\nI bir \u2014 didn\u2019t mention how the ge \u2014 ghetto was established, fairly early, but not the\nfirst day, not e \u2014 not even the first week. The Germans had all kinds of\nannouncements, and telling what to do, return the weapons, this, that, you know, all\nkinds of things, and u-underneath it was \u2014 my friends said, you know, if \u2014 if it\u2019s not\nwritten [indecipherable], we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll executed \u2014 them \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, we\u2019ll shot. Not \u2014 not worth even reading, but if it says we\u2019ll shot, at least\nI read it. But there was another announcement with \u2014 not in German format,\nestablishing a ghetto in Panev\u00e9zys, and requiring to wear this yellow star. Not to\nwalk on the sidewalks, all this thing. I cannot remember, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t remember\nwho signed that, whether it was a Lithuanian mayor, or was a German officer, I\ncannot remember who \u2014 who is \u2014 un-under whose authority was written \u2014 although I\n174October 14, 2010\nknow that in some cases Germans printed, a mayor who didn\u2019t sign.\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: But doesn\u2019t matter, but I don\u2019t know in Panev\u00e9zys, under whose authority it was\nannounced. And the ghetto was established. At the beginning, the idea of ghetto\ndidn\u2019t seem such terrible, because we thought about medieval ghettos. Jews living\nseparately, but well, we imagined, you know, we knew that there were ghettos in\nPoland already. We \u2014 we imagined that there \u2014 I mean, the Jews are \u2014 had in there,\ntheir establishments, professionals, you can go there, buy things with th \u2014 from the\nJews. You can go to the doctor, Jewish doctor, you can go to the lawyer. And then\n[indecipherable] they live just separately. So, not that bad. But when the ghetto was\nestablished, it wasn\u2019t the medieval ghetto, it was \u2014 everybody was crowded in, in the\nsmall place, tak \u2014 they didn\u2019t work in their professions, they had to work outside,\nyou know, s-simple some \u2014 digging or something.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see that. I saw people that were working on \u2014 on the street with the\nyellow \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with the yellow star. And that also was \u2014 made a negative impression on the co\n\u2014 the Lithuanian people in Panev\u00e9zys. Tha-That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s too cruel, that\u2019s too cruel.\n175October 14, 2010\nMaybe the Jews did wrong things, maybe they deserved some kind of punishment,\nbut this \u2014 this was too much. And there was a organization, I know, because my\nmother knows her \u2014 he \u2014 she wasn\u2019t pa-part of the organization, but her good friend,\nthis doctor I talked, Dr. Bridges, who talked with the Jewish doctors about, you\nknow, the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation, his wife, and other,\nmostly from Catholic organizations, made a \u2014 a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.\nFirst of all, there was not enough food for them. There was some food, but not\nenough. So thif \u2014 that\u2019s first thing what they get for, you know, to \u2014 to bring food to\nthe ghetto. Ghetto was guarded by Li-Lithuanian au-auxiliaries.",
        "A: Exactly. Exactly the same. But th-they \u2014 they didn\u2019t care. They \u2014 th-they \u2014 they\ncou \u2014 you could bring bread and soda, th-they didn\u2019t want, you know, to \u2014 to bri \u2014\nthey were supposed not to let to [indecipherable] they just didn\u2019t care. And they\nsaid, well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we buy them, you know, some vodka, you know for this\nservice, but \u2014 they didn\u2019t ask for that, but 1t\u2019s \u2014 so \u2014 but th-there were quite many\nJews, and I don\u2019t know, I\u2014 I\u2014TI just doubt very much that everybody got enough\nfood f\u2014 by this smuggling, but \u2014 but some, you know, apparently held, because it\nwas a rather \u2014 a rather ma \u2014 many la \u2014 women were involved in that, so I suppose\nthere was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was senseless. I mean, wa \u2014 it was something which was a-ab\n\u2014 effective to some \u2014 some degree. And then, you know, came that \u2014 that day of\n176October 14, 2010\nexecution. And the rumor went around that tomorrow the Jews will be killed. First of\nall, I heard about that from thos \u2014 these auxiliaries. Some of th-those auxiliaries\ncame to my friends and said, we are not going to kill anybody. We are not killers, we\nare not going to kill anybody. If they force me for such \u2014 into some executions, we\nare going to \u2014 to flee from the service. And they asked my friends, you know,\nwhether we could arrange for them to hide until they could go out of the city toward\ntheir villages, and hide there, but right now where \u2014 when they ha \u2014 when they\nescape from this. So apparently \u2014 by the way, h-here the Bishop of Panev\u00e9zys comes\nin. He also heard those rumors and in one Sunday \u2014 I wasn\u2019t 1n \u2014 in the ch \u2014 in the\nchurch, it\u2019s \u2014 I regret at the time, not a direct witness, but the whole city was talking\nabout that, that the bishop s \u2014 talked about thou sho \u2014 shall not kill, and he really\ncondemned those who\u2019d kill innocent people, and excommunicated them in advance.\nThose who kill innocent people, or you have killed innocent people he\nexcommunicated and \u2014 and condemned them, not by name, because some of them\nthat just didn\u2019t do that yet. But, as a \u2014 as a category of people, of \u2014 of killers. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, and other innocent people, but \u2014\n177October 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 but he was talking about the Jews. No \u2014 nobody had any doubt, including the\nGermans, because the Germans reacted. They arrested the bishop, put in \u2014 in \u2014 in the\nhouse arrest, and said that he is removed from his \u2014 from his duties, and he has to\nleave Panev\u00e9zys altogether. Okay, so he left Panev\u00e9zys altogether. He had the villa\nin Berciunai, a few kilometers from Panev\u00e9zys, and \u2014 a small resort, and he went to\nhis vil \u2014 to this villa. But he didn't resign from a bishop\u2019s duties, he \u2014 from the villa\nhe just did his old work as a bishop. And Lithuanian administration covered it up,\nyou know. So he \u2014 he was there, you know, and I know \u2014",
        "A: Casimiras Paltarokas.",
        "A: Casimiras Paltarokas. And so \u2014",
        "A: No. [asked after this \u2014 this thing, you know, my friends wer \u2014 did they? No, they\nsaid, they didn\u2019t need to. There was no \u2014 no need. There were enough, those who\nwent willingly, and those who refused were left alone, but all of them resigned from\nthe service then, because we have \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to be associated even with this\n\u2014 the killers, the people. So th \u2014 at least in Panev\u00e9zys there was no \u2014 no \u2014 well,\n178October 14, 2010\npressure maybe, but not \u2014 not really something, you know, forcing to participate in \u2014\nin \u2014 in executions.",

        "A: About two months, yes. Apparently ki \u2014 1-in other places of Lithuania what I\nread, you know, there were executions of various kinds much earlier. But Panev\u00e9zys\nwas a quiet place, and \u2014 until the Germans took over, and \u2014",
        "A: Which way?",
        "A: No, no, it happened that, because it \u2014 there were \u2014 they brought \u2014 they were\ntelling a story, they brought Russian prisoners of war to dig the ditches for that. And\nwhen they gave the dimensions of the ditches, the Russians threw \u2014 threw off their \u2014\ntheir shovels and they refused. Because they were Soviet, people they knew, that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s for their \u2014 for execution. And they assumed for them.",
        "A: And the Germans finally tell them that that\u2019s for Jews, not for you. They didn\u2019t\nbelieve it. They didn\u2019t believe it. They had to take their equipment, whatever, dig the\nditches themselves, or hired sa \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but the Russians wouldn\u2019t do that.",

The day\nwhen the executions started was somehow very strange, you know. Nobody was\ntalking, people just didn\u2019t talk. People \u2014 people stopped talking, you know, it was\nkind of \u2014 myself, I went, you know, to s \u2014 visit my friend, who lived near the \u2014 the\nstreet where the road was leading toward Pajuoste where the executions were taking\nplace. And the trucks full of \u2014 of Jews, I suppose, full of people were just going that\ndirection.",
        "A: Yes. And to his \u2014 with my class friend, we just looked, and didn\u2019t say anything.\nDidn\u2019t say anything because what \u2014 what can you say? What can you say?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah, the whole city knew, definitely. And the reaction was horrified,\nhorrified. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 whether all of them, of course, maybe o-ob \u2014\nobviously, there should have been people who approved. Af-After all, there were\npeople who participated. But generally, you know, when you go to the city and see\nthe people, you \u2014 you can see that everybody\u2019s kind of like paralyzed from horror,\nwhat\u2019s going on. You ga \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 any revenge, anything about the Jews was\nOctober 14, 2010\nforgotten by that time, long ago. When the Jews were brought into the ghetto, you\nknow, the Lithuanians, th-that \u2014 that was the end. The Lithuanians didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t\napprove of that; a ghetto as it was established there, didn\u2019t approve of that, and so \u2014\nbut yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that is a terrible, a terrible thing. Yeah, we \u2014 we went then, after\nthe execution, oh several, several weeks after the execution, and we went to a farm\nwhere one of our friends had the girlfriend 1-in that farm. The farm was nearest farm\nto the execution place. And we wanted to find out. We \u2014 we knew, I mean, it \u2014 it was\na horrible thing happened of a gur \u2014 tremendous significance. Wanted to find out\nwa-wa \u2014 wh-what \u2014 what it was. And they said well, the girl couldn\u2019t tell us anything\nbecause when the executioner cames, the fa \u2014 th-the \u2014 the parents, they say, hid her.\nTold her to go upstairs, you know, and the \u2014 and to hide, and because those \u2014 the\nkillers were going around the co \u2014 the house drinking water, vodka, everything. But\nwe didn\u2019t really, in such a detail as this from BirZai told, there was nothing \u2014\nnothing \u2014 nothing. The same thing, the same Germans and Lithuanians. German\nofficer also killing, you know, babies. Apparently still there\u2019s some resistance of the\nexecutioners to kill babies, so the officer had to take them up on himself. I\u2019m just \u2014 I\nsuppose, that \u2014 that\u2019s my deduction. The story was told that, you know, one\nLithuanian officer was married to a j \u2014 Jewish girl, and when the Jews were brought\nto the ghetto, he went together with her. Lived together with her, and when they\n182October 14, 2010\nbrought to the execution, he went together with her. And he was told, you know, to\ngo out \u2014 go away, you know. He refused, he went with his wife and was killed there.",
        "A: Right, yeah, wa \u2014 the group of us.",
        "A: Nah, no.",
        "A: No. Then they said, you know, at the end of the ex-execution it looked like they\nbecame insane. They were drinking vodka, complaining that th-they \u2014 they cannot\nget drunk, you know, no matter how much vodka they drink. And at the end, you\nknow, it was starting g-getting at dusk, you know. And some of them started going \u2014\nthe \u2014 the Jews had to disrobe, they will start going through their \u2014 within they had\nhidden some \u2014 some valuables there, some gold or whatever, some started going\nthrough those \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014 their clothes. And one of them, of the executioners,\none of them said that you\u2019re not supposed to that, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s supposed\nto leave, you know, for the \u2014 for the \u2014 for the \u2014 the Germans, you know, to take care\nof it. So what they did, they just shot him and threw him together with the Jews in\nthe \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in th \u2014 1n the ditch. Now, this is true \u2014 true story, because about\nyear, or \u2014 or couple of years ago, my friend came to me and said, you know \u2014\nwanted to check with me his translation of a request of a mother of those \u2014 that who\n183October 14, 2010\nwas killed there. He was asked \u2014 she was \u2014 wanted to translate into German, was\nasking the German authority to let dig up the grave, find the remains of her son and\nremove it and bring it to \u2014 to its \u2014 a regular cemetery. So, I saw that \u2014 that letter,\nwhich my friend has translated, we looked at the translation. So I \u2014 I doubt very\nmuch a German would have approved that, I don\u2019t know what happened with that\nstory, but apparently that story is right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: No, about s-s 7,000 - 8,000, something less than 10,000 I would say.",
        "A: Less. Considerably less, but I know, because the city is much smaller.",
        "A: But I\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Pretty soon, I suppose, but they were still ob-obsessed by that, and were \u2014 really\ncame back to that theme. I was working at that time. I took a wa\u2014a-\u2014ajo-\u2014ajobin\nthe municipality of Panev\u00e9zys. We see Germans introduce the food \u2014 food cards.",
        "A: We were supposed to get that much food, you know, for \u2014 and the \u2014 this \u2014\neverybody had to get those cards. Now, it\u2019s tremendous operation, you know, every\npeople have to get those cards in Panev\u00e9Zys. Tremendous lines and \u2014 and lots of\ntime. So they hired people, I was one of them, and many of my friends, to bring\nthose to the people. We got those food cards, we had lists of people who live and\nhow many, and we were bringing those cards to the people themselves, so they\nwouldn\u2019t waste time getting those cards. So it was very interesting because I knew\npa \u2014 pa \u2014 got to know Panev\u00e9zys as never before. You know, all kinds of people\nfrom all professions, all \u2014 all social levels, you know, all nationalities, except the\nJews. Except the Jews. Yeah. And so I brought those cards. Most of the people, you\nknow, just signed for it, a-and I go to the next house and so on. But some of the\npeople were talkative. And \u2014 and some \u2014 and all \u2014 not always, but many of the\n185October 14, 2010\npeople were bringing up this \u2014 the execution of the Jews, and all negative. I suppose\nthat those who were for it, wouldn\u2019t start the discussion at all. I just met one who \u2014\nwho was that, you know.",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 let me see, did I bring a\u2014 a cards? Exactly thinking, I think I\nwas bringing the cards, but he was outside, or he was visiting that fa-family, and I\ndidn\u2019t give him the cards, just the regular \u2014 the residents. And I don\u2019t know, he was\nofficer in Lithuanian army or \u2014 or what, I don\u2019t remember his \u2014 his profession, but\nhe said that his \u2014 he was one of those, when the deportations started who \u2014 who ran\naway to hide because he thought th-they are coming for him. And his family was\ndeported. He \u2014 hi-his wife and two daughters. And he was convinced that the Jews\nwere in that group, and he said he is going to \u2014 to participate in killing of the Jews.\nBut I doubt very much, because he was telling when the Jews in Panev\u00e9zys were\nalready killed, so he had to go to Vilnius or Kaunas, you know, where the\nexecutioners were still working. I doubt very much whether he did that, but I don\u2019t\nknow, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right.\n186October 14, 2010",
        "A: Right. But that was the only one, and I sup-suppose there were more than that,\nbut I \u2014 but I\u2014 I\u2014I would imagine that they wouldn\u2019t start that type of conversation.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And th-that\u2019s why they brought up the subject, they just \u2014 just\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t hold, they just wanted to \u2014 to \u2014 to speak about it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: In Panev\u00e9zys was over, because no Jews were left, unless somebody hid some of\nthe Jews, which happened, as we found out later. At that time nobody w-was\nbragging about it. So \u2014 but I went to Vilnius, to study in Vilnius and there were\nghetto.",
        "A: Ghetto there, really two of them at the beginning. And yeah, but it was so\nisolated, and was at \u2014 the wall, they were really under the wall there, s-so they were\n187October 14, 2010\nso isolated that we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in there. We knew that it \u2014 we saw\nsome of the Jews being driven to some kind of work. We knew they were, some of\nthem, working in the factories, one factory came up in flames because it seems\n[indecipherable] there sabotage, because they were working for the German army,\nfor the \u2014 getting the cur \u2014 th-the furs, you know, for the winter.",
        "A: Yeah, so Kailis factory. So, but we d \u2014 we knew that executions were going on in\nPaneriai. From time to time they were taking out there and \u2014 and being killed. We\nknew that some of the Jews escaped. Escaped \u2014 not only those which were hidden,\nbut escaped into the forests in vil \u2014 in Vilnius area and in Kaunas area, I don\u2019t know\nin other ci-cities. And there joined the Soviet guerillas, Soviet partisans, which the\nmovement, at that time, you know, th-the \u2014 the Soviet planes were parachuting some\nof leaders and weapons. And th-there was that movement of the Soviet partisans, es-\nescaped prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war escaped. Some of the Lithuanian\ncommunists wer \u2014 survived, and the Jews who escaped from the ghettos. Now, at\nthat time there was Lithuanian resistance movement against the Germans, there was\nunderground press going out, letters, and even at that time I noticed one thing. That\nour press, underground press was reporting what the ger \u2014 Germans were doing with\nthe Jews. If they killed, you know, thousand or s \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or so Jews in\nKaunas, there was a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014a notice, a report. There were reports about Jewish\n188October 14, 2010\nguerillas, the Soviet guerillas, but there was no judgment. And even speaking with\nthe people, they didn\u2019t, most of the pe \u2014 they didn\u2019t speak about those things, but if\nthere was \u2014 they spoke about the Jewish guerillas, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t meet anybody who\nwould condemn them. At that time it was clear that they were fighting, that was the\nonly chance to fight for their life. So, ba \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 nobody see how \u2014 how you\ncan condemn them. They were on the other side, they were enemies. Our Lithuanian\ns-security forces, auxiliaries were fighting against go \u2014 Soviet guerillas, also against\nthe Jewish Soviet guerillas, but not because they\u2019re Jew, because they were fighting\nagainst the Soviets. Well, that was, the war was going on, Lithuanians were fighting\nPolish guerillas also. But there were no \u2014 there was not \u2014 not that, as a div \u2014 during\nthe first occupation, where there was that resentment. There was no resentment.\nThey were on the other side, they were like \u2014 like enemy, which you do not\ncondemn, you know, he \u2014 I fight for one cause, he is fighting for another.",
        "A: Law.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.\n189October 14, 2010",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, but my \u2014 one of my friends, who studied together with us in my class, he was\nworking in Lithuanian security under the Germans, and \u2014 and a-as an officer. He was\nstudying and working in the city already. But his job was in particular, against the\nPolish underground. He was well \u2014 and he was killed by the Polish underground\nwhen he was trying to arrest somebody or something like that.",
        "A: So I knew him very well.",
        "A: He was kind of quiet, yeah, generally he was a quiet man. But no-nothing \u2014 but as\nfar as I know he had nothing to do with the Jews, but I can\u2019t be sure. I can\u2019t be sure,\nbut really against the Poles, and still continued that hostility. Doesn\u2019t matter, you\nknow, because the German occupation, but Lithuanians were still fighting the Jew \u2014\nthe Jew \u2014 the Polish, and the Polish Lithuanian, fighting Lithuanians.",
        "A: E-E-Even at that time.\n190October 14, 2010",
        "A: About the Jews during the German occupation?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, not really, except that, you know, in Vilnius I-I was a student, and between\nthe students and \u2014 and some wa \u2014 in the higher class, were definitely condemn \u2014\nwith old \u2014 the opinion was condemning those who had participated in executions,\nand even at that time were participating, because more or less, killing of the Jews in\nPaneriai \u2014 Austai(ph) Paneriai took place all the time, sometimes less, sometimes\nmore and the killers were working all the time. Of course, killers were killing not\nonly the Jews, they were killing also the Poles, and well, Lithuanians, Germans\nkilled themselves. But th-they killed them also.",
        "A: Yeah, the Lahavichos(ph) \u2014 it was territorial defense organization, which\nGeneral Lahavichos(ph) organized with the agreement with Germans, but later, you\nOctober 14, 2010\nknow, fell out. Germans arrested him and disarmed that defense force and killed, you\nknow, hundreds of \u2014 of his soldiers. And then the, you know, Lithuanians from the\neast Prussia, not from Klaip\u00e9dos, but even farther, Tilz\u00e9 and all that, they f \u2014 they\nwere, you know, fled from Nazis to Lithuania in Vilnius, they arrested and\nexecuted them in Austai(ph) Paneriai also.",
        "A: Oh, activities, they were pu-publishing in Lithuanian newspaper, Lithuanian\nbooks. Well, of course, that was all over, because they had to flee from the Nazis and\nthey came to Lithuania. And \u2014 but the tils \u2014 Tilz\u00e9s \u2014 Tilz\u00e9s \u2014 Tilszin(ph) Gestapo\nstill had, you know, get in \u2014 in th \u2014 1n their \u2014 in \u2014 in their plans, and as far \u2014 as soon\nas Germans occupied Lithuania into Vilnius and they came from Tilz\u00e9, they just\ntook them out and executed the whole two families there. So \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I should go through \u2014 through small detail, but\nafter university was closed \u2014 the Germans closed the university. Well, first of all, the\nGermans, after Stalingrad, which was in \u2014\n192October 14, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 1943, which was another turning point, I was very much aware, and most of the\npeople were aware that this a turning point. After Stalingrad we thought maybe, you\nknow, there might be somebody if \u2014 if the Germans throw the Hitler away, or\nsomething may \u2014 some \u2014 but most likely Germans have lost the war. So, Germans\nalso realized that they are in bad shape now. So they decided oh, Lithuanians wanted\nto fight against the Soviets, okay, so let\u2019s call Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians,\nthey established Waffen SS legions for those countries and drafted the young men\ninto those Waffen SS legion. Estonian [indecipherable] legion, and Latvian, two\ndivisions. Estonian, one division, Latvian, two divisions. And Lithuanian,\nLithuanians just boycotted. Nobody really, excepts few invalids reported to the\ninduction center. Well, they became so angry, they closed the universities, because\nthey realized that the students were behind it, and they arrested the \u2014 you know, s \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, about 50, maybe less people very known in Lithuania. P-Priests,\nprofessors, even their administrators who worked on that dam, high administrators\nand brought them to the concentration camp in Stutthof, near Danzig. And all the\nother oppressions, you know, your \u2014 even \u2014 even \u2014 even farmers and so al-al-also.\nSo, once that started \u2014 well, I d\u2014I don\u2019t want to go into lo \u2014 long details, but I \u2014 I\nwa \u2014 I became sick with a pneumonia and was in the hospital and I was discharged\nfor pneumonia. And the Germans took a list of discharged people and drafted us.\n193October 14, 2010\nAnd I saw that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really a sad situation. So I thought that the only thing I have,\nif I don\u2019t want, you know, that my family will suffer [indecipherable] for that, I \u2014 I\nwould rather collec \u2014 select, you know, where do I am going under the Germans.\nAnd I selected so-called Reichsarbeitsdienst. A Reichs labor service, which all the\nGermans had to \u2014 to go through before going into the military service, but also the\ngirls had to go through that. So I w \u2014I volunteered for that, not wanting to go\nanywhere else. My resistance leader approved of that.",
        "A: He himself was part German, and apparently thought that that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s\nadvantageous to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to be on that side [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was.",
        "A: Right, right, yes. So my leader acce \u2014 a-approved of that, and I went into the\narbeitsdienst. I served for, not the full term. I don\u2019t know why, they let us go\nearlier. And we came to Lithuania. We knew that, you know, the German \u2014",
        "A: No, we went to Germany.\n194October 14, 2010",
        "A: We \u2014 we work in Peenemiinde, we were in several places, but I\n[indecipherable] in Peenemiinde where the German rockets were being built, you\nknow [indecipherable] and \u2014 and the other. And Mr. Brown was there, you know, I\n\u2014 we saw him.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, well, just fleeing, you know, he was walking through there. So, was \u2014\nwas \u2014 German were very correct about that. Apparently they wanted to create some\nfriendly people for them, you know. Was \u2014 was no-not bad at all. And the Germans\nwo \u2014 took \u2014 but we were working together with the Germans, mixed together with\nthe Germans, and they were young boys, but friendly. So, was not a bad experience.\nWa-\u2014 one \u2014 bu-but then we were released from that service earlier, before our term\nwas over, because there was supposed to be Lithuanian army, you know, armed\nforces be \u2014 being established, and the general said that he needs some experienced\nsoldiers who could be un \u2014 you know, non-commissioned off \u2014 officers, something\nlike that.",
        "A: Lahavichos(ph).",
        "A: Yeah, and \u2014 an-and so I \u2014 I went back, you know, was discharged and s \u2014 joined\nLahavichos(ph) army. But that was a short thing, you know, couple months until\n195October 14, 2010\nGermans, you know, came in conflict with Lahavichos(ph) for many aspects. They\ndi \u2014 didn\u2019t hold with their agreements. Lahavichos(ph) was a very strong, a very s-\nstubborn and proud man. We loved him, all the soldiers loved him, he was a real\nleader. So the Germans arrested him, his staff, as I said, and disbanded this \u2014 this\nunit and executed some of them. We were let go earlier, so I lived in my aunt\u2019s\nhouse in \u2014 in the village. And then the Russians approached Lithuania, pretty soon\nthey took Vilnius, was a-approaching Kaunas and I decided, you know, that I\u2014 I\u2019m\nnot going to wait for them. Some who mo \u2014 my friends ask me to, you know, join\nthem as guerrilla fighters against the Soviets. I didn\u2019t believe in that, I thought\nmaybe two, three months, not more, you know. I didn\u2019t believe that the west will\nfight for Lithuania. I decided I go west, and try, you know, to \u2014 to meet it, the\nwestern English, or Americans in Germany, because this was obvious Germany\nlost the war, that was clear.",
        "A: No. My mother wanted to go with me, well there was confusion, a lot of\nconfusion. And my pa \u2014 father wanted, you know, he was too late. Panev\u00e9zys was\ntaking without any \u2014 any ba-battle. Germans just demolished electrical plant and\nretreated without any ac \u2014 without any resistance. So my father stayed in Lithuania.\nMy mother eventually went to Germany also, but separately form \u2014 from myself. I\n196October 14, 2010\nwent to Germany, also, we met at the end of war. I met my mother in Munich, and\nwell, I must tell y \u2014 if I tell the full story, so I went to the east Prussia.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, yeah, what \u2014 Soviets e-e-executed a lot of Germans. All of them, really,\nwho were left there, so \u2014 who were digging those \u2014 those anti-tank ditches. Now, one\nafternoon, you know, after \u2014 after lunch, we were \u2014 a break, you know, were eating\nour lunch and suddenly we noticed that SS troopers have surrounded us all around.\nAnd they took out their automatic weapons and one of them came forward. And in\nvery good Lithuanian language, very good, with no accent, nothing, said that we\nLithuanians are all communists, we should be shot right away. We didn\u2019t fight to\ndefend our own country, and we deserve to die row \u2014 right here and now. But, the\n197October 14, 2010\nfuehrer is so great in \u2014 in his \u2014 you know, that he decided to let us \u2014 to \u2014 I mean, to\nw-wer \u2014 to fight f \u2014 for the Germany in this way, you know, of our \u2014 our shame,\nthat we didn\u2019t defend our country, that we are basically communists at heart, who let\nus, you know, wer \u2014 you know \u2014 well, anyway, to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to parole us\nfrom this.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Expiate my sin. So, and this \u2014 so. we will be drafted now in the German army as\nauxiliaries in the Luftwaffe. And wh-who doesn\u2019t, you know, doesn\u2019t appreciate\nfuehrer\u2019s great move, you know, well, we will know about that, how to handle it.\nOkay, so \u2014 so we became German soldiers. Soldiers, no, auxiliaries. No rank,\nnothing like that. They [indecipherable] gave us uniforms, but without any rank\nindications, any insignia, and we were aus \u2014 auxiliaries. We were supposed to do\nwork, we were digging trenches against the sw \u2014 Swedes in Stralsund in Germany.\nStralsund because the Germans at that time thought that Sweden\u2019s will \u2014 going to\njoin the allies and attack them in the north. So we were digging those trenches after\nthat, you know, the Swedes didn\u2019t attack, so they brought us as other tasks. But they\nwere manual tasks, and electrical work, you know, something like that. I don\u2019t know\nwhether to tell the story, I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 because \u2014 are we running out of time?\nOctober 14, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, well \u2014 well, anyways, well after the war, I met my \u2014 my mother. I didn\u2019t go\ninto the prisoner of war, I just deserted from the Germans. I didn\u2019t feel that I owe\nthem anything. And we lived in Germany, | studied in the University of Tubingen,\nstudied law again. And then, you know, my uncle, my mother\u2019s brother brought us to\nthe United States, so \u2014",
        "A: After the war, I had various jobs, the bo \u2014 the first \u2014 the first job I had was a\nmanual job, polishing \u2014 buffing the metal.",
        "A: Brushing \u2014 buffing the lipstick casings. So th-that was work. It was di-dirty work.\nThen I worked in textile, and after I st-studied here and completed my studies in\nUniversity of Connecticut, I \u2014 and then in New York University Business School,\nthen I worked for the government. I worked in the postal service as an economist,\nmaking analyses of new equipment, of new buildings, economic analyses in that\nfield, and worked until I retired. And after that, a short time, I worked in Lithuanian\nmission at the United Nations, when Lithuania became independent. They didn\u2019t\nhave any diplomats, and Mr. Simutas(ph), who was appointed ambassador at the\nUnited Nations, asked me to join his staff.\n199\nOctober 14, 2010",
