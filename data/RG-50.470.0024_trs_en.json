NICK WHITE Page\n1\nNick White Interview 2/10/95\nSWB: Tell me what happened when you came into Dachau.\nNICK WHITE: I recall it was on April the 29th, 1945. When\nunits of the sixth corps, the third, the 45th, and the 36th\ndivision, part of the seventh army, c- c- captured, or over-\nover- overrun the Dachau camp where they had taken so many\nof the Jewish people. But anyway the first thing as we come\ninto the camp, uh, aman by the name of Engelhart from\nDetroit, Michigan was, was the with me, and uh the reason\nthat we were able to get some pictures because he was a\nprofessional photographer and so anytime he could catch, he\nwas able to find German film or German cameras, that was an\nexcellent opportunity to get pictures. But anyway we went\ninto this camp, I said, as I said before, shortly after,\nafter daylight. And the first thing that we encountered\nwas, there was a, there was a moat that was surrounding part\nof the camp anyway, and we were surprised at the number of\ndead SS soldiers that were uh, we were seeing aS we come\ninto the camp, and the reason why there were so many of\nthem, some of them were floating in the moat and some of\nthem were laying alongside in the streets and the reason why\nthere were so many of them was because these were not the\nordinary German soldiers. These men were trained SS\ntroopers who had been indoctrinated down through the years",
        "that the Jewish race was an offense to them and for they had\none thought in mind, that was the el-, annihilation of the\nJewish race. So as I said, these were liber- um group of\nmen so, in other words, an ordinary German soldier, when\nthey would be surrounded, would immediately surrender. But\nthese men fought hard because they didn't want these, this\nterrible uh truth to get, be revealed of what had taken or\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. NICK WHITE Page\n2\nwas taking place at this concentration camp. So the net\nresult, there was no prisoners taken and so they were strewn\npretty much all over the camp. But I, one thing I do\nremember, uh, al- one of the streets, just adjacent to this\nmoat, there was a um, the body of a German soldier, and\nstanding beside him was a police dog. And that dog didn't\npay any attention whatever to us. He just stared straight\nahead, he act like he didn't even see us, and yet here again\nwas, this dog had been trained to look upon those people as\na threat to him, and so, whenever his master was, his life\nwas taken, he come up with no reason for being there. And\nso he just set like a statue, and I thought, what a_e shame\nthat this dog had given up his whatever he had, his",

But from there we\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. NICK WHITE Page\n3",
        "go into the barracks. They were long, um, almost like a\npoultry building that we might see down in Missouri, uh,\nperhaps a hundred feet long and maybe twenty-five feet wide.\nBut as we went into this first barracks, we were overrun\nalmost by about 25 or 30 of these inmates, who came _ and\nhugged us and tried to show us the gratitude they had for us\nbeing there liberating them. Actually we did not reli-\nliberate them, it was the infantry units themselves\u2019) that\nliberated these people but anyway, they were so overwhelmed\nwith emotion that they tried every way they could to show us\nappreciation but I remember this young man, his name was, we\ncalled him Bud, he and I both had some caramels and I had\nsome K ration biscuits, and we started to distribute them\namong these soldiers. Or rather, these camp inmates. And\num, the net result was all, we almost started a riot,\nbecause they fought like animals, trying to re- to ris- to\nget anything that looked like food. And I, this man and I\nhave discussed that since then and we have never encountered\nsuch a atmosphere of complete um desolation of the, of\nmankind. And then I recall that in these, in this um\nbuilding itself, it was made like shelves that went clear to\nthe ceiling and they would be just maybe two feet wide and\ntwo feet square, and these went the full length of the\nbuilding, and these people would climb up and slide into\nthese slots, I guess, I guess you could call them, and not a\nblanket, not any kind of bed clothes at all. Nothing but\npure wood. And there they slept at night, and no, no\nventilation, and no sanitary, um, equipment that they would",
        "need. But that, uh, what bothered me the most, was out of\nthese 25 or 30, there was 6 or 8 that just stared at the\nwalls. I mean, there was not one bit of a feeling of or any\nkind of a expression of um who they were or what they were\ndoing there. They just stared at the walls and I've often\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. NICK WHITE Page\n4\nwondered, I wonder how many of these ever will be able to\nrecover from that traumatic experience that they had been\nthrough. And so, that left me sad to say the least. I hope\nmany of them recovered from that, but I have talked to\ndoctors, they said, with the amount of trauma then been\nexperienced, they may have never recovered. But we spoke to\none of them who could speak English, and we asked him where\nare you going, and he said I'm going home. And so. from\nthere we went into the gas chamber and as we looked around\nthe corridor of it, there was a, uh, nozzles of gas and the\nthing that, that um, I-I wanted to share with you that these\npeople that were in the barracks were required to work as\nlong as they could possibly work. When they were no longer\nable to work, they went out into the mines, into the fields,\nand harvest the grain and repaired railroads and repaired",
        "highways, whatever damage the American bombers were causing\nfrom day to day. That's where these people were out\nworking. Yet they were so thin, I don't see how they could\npossibly work, but they were. When they could no longer\nwork, then they were taken into the gas chamber, and they\nwere told, remove their clothing, that they were going to\nget a shower. And instead of a shower, they were gassed by\nthe hundreds. From the gas chamber, which was adjacent to\nthe uh, mor- uh, crema- crematorium itself, was, we opened\ninto a large corridor, a room, and there was...\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#2 ]\nSWB: Okay, let's just back up to where you went in and saw\nthe crematoria and the gas chambers, and just walk your way\nin and tell me what you saw.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. NICK WHITE Page\n5\nNICK WHITE: As we looked into the gas chamber, we had been",
        "told that there weren't any [clears throat] there weren't\nsuch as thing as nozzles, and yet it was not a water or a\nspray nozzle, but it was a nozzle made especially for gas to\nput these, to exterminate these people in a, quickly as\npossible. And so the net result was that they were um\naS-as-as soon as they were gassed then they were taken into\nthis large room where they were piled high, and uh, it\nlooked like they had just been taken and just grabbed by the\nlegs and throw up ina, a large pile, and I- and I-I would\nestimate there were probably several thousand bodies in this\narea. And there was eight furnaces that were going full\nblast and these, for instance, were tended by um, several of\nthe inmates who were garbed in the prison clothing, so we\nknew they also were inmates, and um I often wondered what a\ntraumatic experience for these people to burn some of their\nown people, day by day, and is it any wonder that some of\nthem had lost their whole sense of being, their personality\nseemed to have disappeared from them.\nSWB: What else did you see in that room with the bodies,\ndescribe the pile of bodies to me again.\nNICK WHITE: The pile of bodies, you have to, you'd had to\nbeen there or seen a picture to ex- appreciate how much\nthese poor people had suffered before they were gassed even.\nIt- it's just, it's untold the suffering that they must have\nhad to endure even before that, uh, it's- it's just beyond\nany imagination what they had suffered, and so, I, aS we\nwent into this large area where this, these bodies were",
        "piled high, there was a sense of complete, uh, death, it\nseemed like its very atmosphere was death, and um, I've\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. NICK WHITE Page\n6\nnever forgotten that and the odor was unbelievable, it was\nalmost more than you could endure to be there, and yet\nthese, these men that were tending these furnaces had to be\nthere day and night. And uh, when we come into the camp,\nthey were dyings, 500 a day, in the barrackses, in the\nbarracks, themselves. And there were 33,000 people here.\nBut as we [clears throat] when we left the crematorium then,\nand went outside, not very far away from this building, was\na large, or a high fence, enclosed wire, with had been uh\ncharged with electricity, but the, the gate had been opened,\nSo, aS we went out, we opened up this gate again, and there\nwe found 39 open box cars, and so we climbed up to see what\nwas there, and there we beheld, dozens, I mean dozens of\ndozens of people who had been brought in from who\u2019 knows\nwhere, all over Europe maybe, and there they were allowed to\nbe on that uh siding for perhaps several days. Some of them\nhad froze to death, some of them had died from ex- um ,\nstarvation, and some had been uh gunned down by the, by the",
        "German guards when the Americans were approaching. And this\nis something I will never forget as long as I live, to see\nthis, the very um, the very purpose of this whole, uh, camp\nwas the destruction of the Israel people.\nSWB: Can you tell me about any interaction with individual\nprisoners that you might have had, did they smile?\nNICK WHITE: There was absolutely a smile on no one. It was\nnothing but death, even in those who were, who were uh able\nto speak with us. Their, their eyes were, had sunk clear\nback into their heads, and you, as-as-as I said, you had to\nbe there to really understand how much these people had\nsuffered. And I recall aS we were there by that row of\nrailroad cars, several of these had, that had been released,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int. NICK WHITE Page\n7\nthere was a garbage dump there, and I saw them pick up that\ngarbage by the handfuls and eat it. I mean that was, they\nwere starved to that point, where they would eat anything.\nSWB: Tell me about the pile of bodies and the one that was",
        "out of place.\nNICK WHITE: The, the picture that I have shows this, on one\nof the piles, probably maybe a thousand bodies in this\nparticular pile, but the thing that was the most uh hard to\nunderstand, these people were able to get hold, ahold of the\ncamp commander, and beat him to death, and then they tossed\nhim up on the top of these poor people who had been gassed\nthere shortly before that.\nSWB: Tell me what you knew when you arrived there. Had you\nbeen, did you know what to expect, tell me about your very\nfirst sensation.\nNICK WHITE: We had never been given any idea what it might\nbe like. But only that the name Dachau, smelt, s-s- told us\nthat it was something out of the ordinary, and that's the\nreason why we took advantage to go and visit that so early,\nso soon after it had been taken by the units of the seventh\narmy.\nSWB: So now describe to me again walking in and try to take\nyourself back to exactly how you felt. Did you _ hesitate,\ndid you stop, were you...\nNICK WHITE: It is so long ago, that I'm telling you this,\nI- I have, no longer have the trauma that I had at that\ntime, but I will say this, it is beyond my comprehension how",

Things that we don't\neven see in the world of nature.\nSWB: Tell me again the story of giving caramels.\nNICK WHITE: When we, uh, after these men had given us such\na tremendous uh welcome, into their midst we decided that\nperhaps we had these caramels and these um _  K-ration\nbiscuits, maybe we could share some of them with them. And\nuh as we tried to uh pass them out to each one individual,\nall of a sudden we just, we could see we were causing nearly\na riot, which we might uh, put ourself in jeopardy to be a\npart of. And so we um hastened to um to remove ourself from\nthe area.\nSWB: Did the inmates make any sounds? Did they call out to\nyou, do you remember?\nNICK WHITE: No, I don't recall, only this one man, we asked\nhim, cause we were, we were concerned about, what are these\npeople going to do. They're starving now, and um what\u2019 are",
        "they going to, and no doubt many of them were hundreds of\nmiles from their homeland, and yet this man said, I'm going\nhome when we asked him where are you going, he said I'm\ngoing home, and yet, and, and then, as we went out of the\ncamp, the roads were just packed with people, um, trying to\nget away from the camp as fast as they possibly could, to go\nanywhere but to be out of Dachau.\nSWB: Okay, thank you.\n[CUT ]\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

        "going. Some of them were out on the highways, some of them\nwere just standing out on the highways, some of them were\nmovng south towards Munich. But most of them were aimlessly\nwalking around the camp, uh, most of them, uh, had no where,\nno way to get to where they would like to go without\nwalking, and most of them were unable to walk, because of\ntheir physical condition. Even those that we saw in _ the\nbarracks, they were so thin, you could reach around their\nwaist with two hands, I mean that's how thin they were and\nit was amazing to me that they could still walk. That was\nthe amazing thing, that these had, those people had _ the\nability to get up and walk, after suffering so much.\nSWB: This picture, describe to me this picture, can you see\nit from there. Describe it as if I can't see this picture.\nNICK WHITE: As we come into the um crematorium uh itself,\nuh when we saw that, this tremendous body of people who had\nbeen, had endured so much and we could even see like they\nwere still suffering on their faces, it seemed to carry on\nafter they died, the horror that they had, uh, experienced.\nIt was still on their faces, just as I talked about that\npolice dog, all of a sudden he had no reason to be there.\nSWB: Tell me about how the inmates were still burning the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",

I\ndon't think they even thought about it anymore, it just\nbecome mechanical to them, well they couldn't have kept\ndoing it. Uh, that's the way it looked to me. Uh, them, I\ndon't know why, what would motivate them, no one was\nstanding over them with a gun anymore, but they were still\npu- they would ta- they had ropes and they would drag them\nover to the furnaces. And it appeared there was a grate\nunderneath where the ashes fell through and then they would\npull this grate this back out and then pile the two more\nbodies on them. In one of the camps uh adjacent to this,\nwhich is in Poland, they were burning 4000 bodies ae day.\nWell I have no idea how many they were burning here but\u2019 we\nknow there was at least 500 dying a day plus what they were\ndestroying in the gas chamber.\nSWB: Tell me again about the pile of bodies and tell me\nthat the, tell me the difference between the bodies and the",

And uh the men, and TI might\nadd, there were no women in, and no children in this, in\nDachau, they were all men, and most of them middle = aged,\neven to maybe in the twenties, but none that were very old,\nbut I would believe they were in no more than 40 at the",

You'd had _ to\nseen it to understand what they had endured.\nSWB: In your military career had you seen death before.\nNICK WHITE: Yes, but it seemed like before this there had\nbeen some, maybe a purpose to be gained by giving a life, we\nas Americans felt we were fulfilling a tremendous\nresponsibility, and the American soldier laid his life on\nthe line. But when you go into a camp, there's\u2019 absolutely\nno purpose for that, that is of any value to mankind. But\nfor the destruction of a race.\nSWB: Okay let's cut.\n[CUT]\nNICK WHITE: Um yes I recall that very well, because the\nfirst uh, when we first come in there and they just engulfed\nus just about, and there was just the two of us, and there\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
