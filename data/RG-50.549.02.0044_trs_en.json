        "Question: -- Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This is an\ninterview with Fela Warschau, conducted by Gary Covino, on June 10\", 1999, in\nSheboygan, Wisconsin. This is a follow up interview to a United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum videotaped interview conducted with Fela Warschau on February\nninth, 1995. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges\nJeff and Toby Herr, for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.\nWell thanks for doing this interview today.",
        "Answer: Oh, you\u2019re welcome.",
        "Q: We\u2019re sitting in your house in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. It\u2019s a little bit warm, so we\nhave the windows open, in case you hear a little bit of traffic outside, or kids playing, or\nwhatever. A lot of kids playing on the streets around here.",
        "A: Sorry, couldn\u2019t predict the weather.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay, no problem. Let me just have you say your name, and where we are\ntoday.",
        "A: My name is Fela Warschau. I live in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, on 2407 North 12\"\nStreet, and the day is June 11\", 1999.",
        "Q: A very sunny Friday. You\u2019ve already done two very comprehensive, very eloquent,\nactually, interviews for the Holocaust Museum --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- on -- on video.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: So, in our interview today, we\u2019re not going to go over as much of your wartime\nexperiences, as you have in those videos, those are --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- pretty complete. So -- But what we want to do today is talk about what\u2019s been\nhappening to you since the war. And I\u2019m just trying to think of a good place to pick up.\nYou\u2019ve told the story of the day of liberation --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and you were in Bergen-Belsen --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- concentration camp. And, you know, one question I had, which you didn\u2019t talk\nabout specifically in these interviews, 1s the final days of the war, the conditions in the\ncamp were just deplorable. And you and your sister --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and two friends --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- were keeping yourselves alive with one potato.",
        "A: Yes, but we also came -- we came to Bergen-Belsen, having a li -- a portion of bread\nfrom Hamburg, from a -- from a so-called labor camp. But this labor camp was a sub-\ncamp of Neuengamme. And it -- Neuengamme was an extermination camp, everybody\nknows that, but somehow we got transported to Bergen-Belsen, with this piece of bread\nyet. So we ate first this bread, and then this potato, but it was just impossible to -- you\nknow, we were losing our strength, and could barely walk. So, it is true that we stayed\nalive with one potato, I don\u2019t know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to\nthe end, we couldn\u2019t walk any more. Went in in the barrack to lay down, and to die. This\nis when liberation came. I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the\nwalking around typhoid fever. I wasn\u2019t that severe, my sister was. She had to be taken\naway to a hospital, and she was very, very ill. When -- When she got well, I could hardly\nrecognize her. She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp. But\nsomehow, you see, we survived, and we didn\u2019t find anyone of our family. It was very\nheartbreaking, and at this point it seems pointless to live. There was nothing to go on for.",
        "Q: On the -- On the -- the actual day of liberation, as you talked about in your video\ninterviews, you had actually, I guess, gone into the barracks, and y-you --",
        "A: Gave up.",
        "Q: You were going to die?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, we did. And one of my friends, she -- she wanted to -- to just walk out, and\nsort of a last farewell look at the camp, and came back and told us that was funny things\ngoing on out there. I just said, \u201cForget it. You hallucinating,\u201d you know. \u201cLet me die in\npeace.\u201d She kept on nudging, and my sister went out. I don\u2019t know where my sister got\nthe strength to come back and grab me by my arm, and tell me, \u201cGet up, you have to see\nwhat -- what is out there.\u201d It was unbelievable. I just didn\u2019t think I was alive. No, it was\nimpossible. I thought I died.",
        "Q: Did you think it was some sort of dream?",
        "A: Yes, sort of like I was watching, you know, this isn\u2019t really happening to me. I don\u2019t\nknow. But it was real enough, and we were liberated by the English army. It was\nheartbreaking though, that so many people, those living pe -- skeletons that couldn\u2019t walk\nany more, you know, getting bread, and couldn\u2019t make use of it any more, because that\ntoo late for them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know?",
        "Q: The -- The question I had about all this, because you have talked about this in -- at\nsome length in your other interviews, is if the British hadn\u2019t come right then, if an allied -",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- military force had not arrived somewhere in that period --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- to liberate the camp, do you have any notion how much longer you might have\nlived?",
        "A: Maybe a day or two. Because maybe I wouldn\u2019t be starved to that point of dying, but I\ncompletely gave up, because I thought there was no other way. There\u2019s nothing left.\nSooner or later, we all will be dead. This is the end of it. So, just giving up on everything.\nNo food, no water, nothing. Nowhere to turn. There -- There -- Outside the barbed wire,\nthere was kohlrabi -- I probably mentioned that too, the piles kohlrabi that were\ndecomposed, that people there still risking their lives to get one of those squash things, a\nsmelly things to eat.",
        "Q: What are those? Kohlrabi, what -- what is it?",
        "A: It\u2019s like -- What can I say? It\u2019s a thing that you used to feed animals. And I know it\nwas -- in Europe it\u2019s called kohlrabi, I don\u2019t know how to translate this into English, up\nto this day, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s supposed to have been the people\u2019s food. It was\nwarm in April, you know. The sun was beating down on that. The kohlrabi was\ndecomposed. People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were\nshot. They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so\ndesperate to get this. But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. I was a\nvery timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. If it\nwouldn\u2019t be for her, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be alive, because she worked in a different place,\nwhere she had more access to food. And she always used to smuggle into the camp, some\nof it for me, which was a great help.",
        "Q: After all that you had been through for all those years --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and all that happened to you, why is it at this particular time -- you say you had\ngiven up?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why do you think it was at this particular time that -- that you started to feel that way?",
        "A: You mean, after I was liberated?",
        "Q: No, just before. You said you had, you know --",
        "A: Because I could see that there was no hel -- no help coming from nowhere. Nothing.\nWhere do we go? Surrounded by barbed wire and dead corpses. And you walked around,\nand -- and people were just dying right in front of you. What was waiting for us? The\nsame thing, you know? So it\u2019s just -- you might as well, sooner or later, because there\u2019s\nno other way.",
        "Q: But you had -- didn\u2019t you have indications that the Germans were losing the war at\nthat point?",
        "A: Oh yes, we know that. We know they were losing the war, especially when I was in\nHamburg, then we were still working there on the streets, you know? Th-The fliers, the\nAllied fliers, they were coming three, four, five times a day, and we worked there. Like it\nsays in my interview, next to a radar station, we could hear that radar turning and\nbeeping, and the sirens going on. They were here. We could -- We could hear the bombs\nflying, and everything. And the city of Hamburg was one rubble on top of the other.\nThat\u2019s the way it looked. So we knew no -- no country in condition -- in condition like\nthat could win a war. It was impossible for them. But the question was, are we -- are we -\n- will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this? That was the question.",
        "Q: Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was\ngoing, and -- and how long you thought it would be before it ended, before it was over?",
        "A: We really did not. It -- We were so absorbed in trying, first to survive from day to day.\nWe did not see a tomorrow. That\u2019s what it was, just trying to survive every day as it\ncame.",
        "Q: So things like what was happening in Hamburg with the bombings, and the --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- other things you saw, they were sort of -- you would see them, but it was almost like\nthat was kind of the -- the background --",
        "A: Yes, it --",
        "Q: -- to just staying alive.",
        "A: -- it wasn\u2019t touching us, just this is it, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. This may sound like a silly question, but how long can four people make one\npotato last? You --",
        "A: Would you --",
        "Q: You talk about this one potato.",
        "A: Would you believe that? We made it last almost three or four days, just eating -- you\ncould look through that slice when we were eating. I don\u2019t know w-what kept us going. I\nhonestly don\u2019t know. People say, oh, you were destined. God was watching over you,\nthat you should survive and be able to tell that story. I really don\u2019t know what forces kept\nus alive. It\u2019s just impossible to tell.",
        "Q: Before you started eating it, how big was the potato? Do you remember?",
        "A: Well, I would say it was quite a nice size, you know?",
        "Q: You\u2019re showing about four or five inches there.",
        "A: I would say --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- something like that.",
        "Q: Oh, okay, so, you know --",
        "A: How she found it, I don\u2019t know. I say it was a miracle.",
        "Q: Right. It must have taken a lot of willpower not to eat more of it, at once.",
        "A: Yes, it did, but it seems like we were always the ones that had this willpower. When\nwe went to work, we got our portion of bread in the morning, some people ate it right\naway, they were so hungry. We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my\nfriends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have\nthe reassurance that I have something to eat for later. We knew nothing else was coming.\nSt -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one\ntime -- you worked for a couple weeks in a village across the Elba. The village was called\nKronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat. But that was also -- you had to be lucky to\nbe picked for this. You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the\nvillage, because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so 1t was\na great big fight in the morning to get first in line, to be picked for this place. We were\nalways divided in different working groups. Most of the time, a majority of the time, I\nwas in Hamburg, cleaning the streets.",
        "Q: Before liberation, at the end, you -- you talked about, in your video interview, how the\n-- there were, you know, still, of course, you know, German guards there, but they were\nwearing surrender armbands, and --",
        "A: Tho-Those were not German guards any more.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Those were -- They\u2019re volunteer militias from the Ukraine, Lithuane, and Hungary,\nand they -- they had white armbands, we could see that. And those people were still\nshooting at us, when the people tried to get those kohlrabi, you know? I can\u2019t understand\ntheir logic, and their way of thinking.",
        "Q: In those final days, were there still any sort of selections going on?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: That had stopped?",
        "A: Chaos. It was nothing. Not where we were. You see, Bergen-Belsen, were like several\ncamps together, divided. That much I know, because if -- we were with others, but not --\nI didn\u2019t even know that children survived there, in certain places. We di -- We didn\u2019t\nknow that, because we were not together with these people.",
        "Q: So in the end it really wasn\u2019t -- the killing that was going on in the camp was not the --\nthe organized systematic killing, but it --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- but things were still happening.",
        "A: I-It -- Things were happening, and they didn\u2019t have to do anything. People were just\ndying, because they didn\u2019t feed -- s -- the people that were there previously, they\nprobably weren\u2019t fed for the longest time already. So, that was just like -- they were self-\ndestructing, they didn\u2019t have to do anything.",
        "Q: When the British came into the camp, and one of your friends came in and told you to\ntake a look, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you started to see these scenes, and you weren\u2019t sure if you were dreaming, or if it\nwas real, again you\u2019ve talked about all that in your video interview. Do you remember\nyour first contact with any of the -- the British soldiers?",
        "A: Not -- Well, we -- they ge -- they handed out food. This is all I ru -- I remember, being\nclose in contact. I also watched them later, right away film that liberation. They were\nputting it on film. And I know there is a video of it, 1t\u2019s called liberation of Bergen-\nBelsen. This is exactly what they did, right away. And next thing I know, when we were\nsort of already settled, and they came in -- I don\u2019t know, they must have been Scotchmen,\nor whatever, they came in with their bagpipes and skirts, you know. And I was sitting on\n-- on the curb, and I looked up, and that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a man dressed like that,\nin a skirt, and I just laughed so hard, I could hardly catch my breath, cause I didn -- never\nsaw anything like it.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you and your sister said to each other in the first moments,\nwhen you realized what was going on?",
        "A: We were just overwhelmed, and then my sister started feeling very sick, and we tried\nto get her in the hospital, but there was no hospitals there, there were just makeshift\nbuildings, mattresses on the floors, and the people were laying just covered up with\nsheets. Not enough doctors, and do you know, the German population from around, they\nwere forced to come into the camp and see all this. And the English needed help with the\nsick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn't even want to come in, they had to be\nbrought in at gunpoint. They didn\u2019t want to come and help the sick people. It took me a\nlong time to find my sister in those buildings. I didn\u2019t know where they took her. Finally\nI found her, and there she was on the floor laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water\nto her head, and she said, last night the doctor said to her -- he looked at her, and he said,\n\u201cThis woman has the crisis tonight. If she\u2019s al -- If she survives, she\u2019Il be alive tomorrow\nmorning.\u201d She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep a whole night, I wanted to die with my eyes open.\u201d\nHere I come in the morning, and thank God she was alive. Then they first started giving\nher medication. Medication was so scarce that they only gave it to people they thought\nwould survive. That was the case of it.",
        "Q: What was your sister\u2019s name?",
        "A: Helen.",
        "Q: And is she still alive?",
        "A: Yeah, she lives in Milwaukee. Yeah, but she does not care to talk a lot about it.\nThere\u2019s certain people that don\u2019t, my husband especially.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Before we move on, maybe you could give us the names of your various\nfamily members --",
        "A: My -- My --",
        "Q: -- and a little --",
        "A: -- immediate?",
        "Q: Yeah, and you know, a little description of them, and just what -- what you know of\nwhat happened to them.",
        "A: You mean my 1 -- my -- like my mother and father? Well, my mother\u2019s name in\nYiddish was Matel. I don\u2019t know how to translate it any other way, that\u2019s what it was. My\nfather\u2019s name was Israel. I had two more brothers. One of them was called in Yiddish,\nSmaul Hirsch, and the other one, Yankel David. And we all came from the Lodz ghetto\ninto Auschwitz, and this is what happened to them, they never got out of there.",
        "Q: Out of the ghetto itself?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t get out of the ghetto?",
        "A: No, we -- we all went with the transport from the ghetto, together we went to\nAuschwitz, but they never got out of there. They were -- My mother was with us when\nthey were selecting the people, they just took her right to the left side. And my two\nbrothers and my father, we didn\u2019t know for sure, but then we met a gentleman that was in\nthe ghetto, a neighbor, and he was behind them in line, and he told us that they went the\nwrong way, so there was no way we could find anybody any more.",
        "Q: How about other relatives, members of your family? Their names, and what you\nknow?",
        "A: You mean uncles and aunts?",
        "Q: Sure, [indecipherable]",
        "A: My father had one, two -- he had two brothers and two sisters. I don\u2019t know exactly\nwhat happened to them, because they didn\u2019t live in the same city, they lived in -- away\nfrom Lodz, in a small place called Alexandroff, in Pola -- in -- in Polish, and my mother\nhad one brother, but my mother\u2019s brother had about six or seven children, and from all of\nthose children, two of them survived, a brother and a sister. But the brother died several\nyears ago in New Jersey, he had cancer, and he died. His sister, I think, is still alive in\nJerusalem. I haven\u2019t heard from her for a long time. And from my father\u2019s side --",
        "Q: What -- What were their names? Before we go on, what -- their names were?",
        "A: My cousin\u2019s name? My cousin\u2019s name was Hill, and my cous -- her -- the lady\u2019s name\nwas Cela -- Celine. Those two survived, but there were more that did not survive. And\nfrom my father\u2019s side, none of them survived, there was no sign of them. My\ngrandparents -- My grandma -- My grandma was taken away, my mother\u2019s mother, huh.\nShe was really an old lady. It-It\u2019s hard to talk about it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You said your sister doesn\u2019t like to speak of these things?",
        "A: Not much, no. Mm-mm. She was asked several times by the generation after in -- in\nMilwaukee that organizes the survivors to speak in schools. She went a couple times, but\nshe doesn\u2019t care to do that, no. My husband wouldn\u2019t do that, either.",
        "Q: What about just privately, like when you and your sister talk, or when you see each\nother --",
        "A: Well, yes --",
        "Q: -- if you talk on the phone, does it come up?",
        "A: -- we reminiscent -- reminiscent. I have one of my friends that we were together. She\nlives in New Jersey. The other one died, also several years of cancer. Otherwise, when I\nwent -- you see, my two daughters, I have two daughters, they live in New York City,\nand when we used to go and visit in New York City, I used to get together with them,\nbecause it\u2019s like family, you know, we were always together. One of them had died\nseveral years ago, she was sick. But this one is alive, and we are always in touch. As a\nmatter of fact, we just talked on the phone about a week ago, and we always reminiscent\nabout the old times, where we were. They were also in the Lodz ghetto. From different\nplaces, you know, he took people from all over Poland, dragging them into the -- certain\nghettos from here and there, confusing us completely. And she was from a little town\nsomewhere, but she spent time in the ghetto, and from there, also came to Auschwitz, so\nwe have been in the same camp, afterwards. And liberated together, so we are always in\ntouch.",
        "Q: When you talk to your sister, what type of things come up? What -- What type of\nthings do you talk about or remember?",
        "A: Home. How it was before the war. About my father, my -- my brothers, what we all\ndid. My mother, my grandmother. My grandmother had a little grocery store. In Europe\nit\u2019s entirely different. It\u2019s not like here, you know. I -- I don\u2019t know how to describe, but\neverything was in canvas sacks, you know. You had a scale, and bags, and people came,\nand said, \u201cGive me a half a pound.\u201d So you took -- took a bag out, and took it out of the\nsack, and weigh it, and just give it to the people. But they got to get on in age, and th -- it\nwas hard for them. You d -- had no people working for you, if you wanted to make a\nliving, you had to do everything yourself. So they sold that little grocery store, and both\ncame to live with us, grandpa and grandma. Grandpa died right before the war, about two\nor three years before the war, and grandma un -- when they came to live with us, she sort\nof took over the kitchen. She was used to always being busy, and my mom was very\ndistressed about it, because my father\u2019s workshop was sort of divided between the\nkitchen and his workshop. So she used to say, \u201cMom, what are you doing? People come\nup and they think I made a maid out of you.\u201d And she used to say, \u201cWhat am I supposed\nto do, sit down and die? Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d So my mom used to say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you\nlet at least the girls help you with the dishes?\u201d She said, \u201cOch, let them go and play.\nWhen they get married, they\u2019Il do plenty dishes.\u201d So that was, you know? And then in\nwintry nights, we used to sit around in the evening, my grandpa used to tell stories about\nsages, and learned man, all these cert -- also certain fables, or we used to play -- of all the\nthings we used to play in winter, Bingo, or cards we used to play, with the children, it\nwas like a game. The s -- And neighbors used to come up, and have like a neighborhood\nklatch, you know? It was always -- our house was always full of company. People used to\ncome, and even during the war, when they occupied, and we were still in our own\napartment, my father was forced to -- to work for the Germans because he was about the\nonly craftsman in our little place, and you had to do what they told you, you know,\notherwise they shoot -- they come -- they come, my father had to repair their watches.\nThey -- They brought gold pieces that they robbed all these big farm -- rich farms. My\nfather had to melt them down and make bracelets, and rings, and whatnot, all that they\nsend into Germany. And so we had -- we had to work for them. A lot of them were real\nbad, but there were -- there was a single one among them that would bring some bread, or\nwhatever, which was very helpful in those times. But still, the neighbors -- and there was\na lot of people that had no food any more, and whatever we had, people used to come up,\nand we had a big bench, and a table on the side, whatever we cooked, we always used to\nshare with everybody. I-It\u2019s not something that I\u2019m trying to tell you because I won\u2019t get\na medal for it, but that\u2019s the way it was in our house, we used to share everything we had.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So it sounds like when you talk to your sister about the past, mostly what\nyou talk about is your family life before the war.",
        "A: Yes, yes, a lot of times. Well, talking about the war brings a lot of bad memories, and\na lot of heartache. Most of the time we try to avoid it, unless there\u2019s something specific\nthat comes up.",
        "Q: What might that be? What -- What -- A certain anniversary, or something in the news?",
        "A: Oh, probably. Anniversary of liberation, or when we go to, in spring, you know, when\nthey -- Yom HaShoah day comes, or whatever. So it\u2019s just -- certain things come back,\nand reminisce -- then we reminisce in the -- those times. Remember when this happened,\nand we almost dead. Like I got blood poisoning working on -- on a -- they call it\nbowshtella, we had to dig ditches for foundations for the peop -- for homes for the people\nthat were bombed out in Hamburg, when I was working on that place -- assigned to that\njob, and I hit a rusty nail, and I got blood poisoning in my hand, in my whole hand here.\nWe had an infirmary, I went to this, there was a Czech woman, also prisoner. She just\ndigged around and digged around and -- with nothing, and couldn\u2019t find anything. At that\ntime we had an Obersharfuthrer who was crazy about us being healthy. He didn\u2019t care\nabout food or anything, just healthy. So at that time, three of us were sick, so he took the\nthree of us, with a German SS woman, and there was one of -- always picked the altesta\nfrom our own people, and they took us into the city. Well, that camp was in Zazell, and\nthey took us into the city of Hamburg. I -- The only thing I know, that we went into a\nprisoner of war camp. I don\u2019t know to this day if it was French or Czech, or -- or Italian,\nor Czech, or whatever it was, I have no idea, because I couldn\u2019t recognize the language.\nAnd this doctor, when my -- they had a doctor there, also prisoner. When my turn came,\nhe looked at my finger, and he pointed, and then he pointed at the plain wooden table,\npointed that I should lay down. Stretched out myself, and he poured from a bottle ether\non my face -- just plain ether. I was choking, bells were ringing in my ears, and I thought\nI was dead. This is it, I\u2019m dying, I gave up. But when I woke up, I was sitting already,\nand my finger was bandaged. And afterwards, they changed my bandages in camp, then I\ncould see what it looked like, my finger was like separated in half. My whole nail was\ngone, and there was a piece, they cut off there a piece. But I healed ver -- very, very\nslowly. I had to go to work with all that. So, we had ups and downs in the camp, you\nknow? There were some that cared, again, for food, but didn\u2019t care for our welfare. These\n-- They called them the Obersharfihrer, that the camp, tha -- from the SS that\nadministered the camp, and we had a few that were real vicious, too. We had SS women\nalso, and they were even worse than the men.",
        "Q: What -- If we could talk about what happened after liberation. You didn\u2019t leave, as I\nunderstand it, you didn\u2019t leave Bergen-Belsen immediately --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- there was a period in which people stayed in the camp.",
        "A: Well, you had to re-gain your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her\nbrothers, they came to take her back to the American zone, they did talk us into going\nwith them, thinking, oh maybe you still will find someone, you know? We did go. Of\ncourse, we had no money, no we traveled how we traveled.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFela Warschau. This is tape number one, side B. -- Bergen-Belsen immediately --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- there was a period in which people stayed in the camp.",
        "A: Well, you had to re-gain your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her\nbrothers, they came to take her back to the American zone, they did talk us into going\nwith them, thinking, oh maybe you still will find someone, you know? We did go. Of\ncourse, we had no money, no, we traveled how we traveled.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you, you -- you know, in the camp it was you and your sister, and --\nand you mentioned these two friends.",
        "A: Two friends.",
        "Q: Do you remember their names, and could you tell us a little bit more about --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- them, and where they came from, and --",
        "A: Sure. The one that died is -- her name was Doba Finkelstein. The other one was --\nname was Genia Stolsoft, and Genia came from a small place called Kovol, but Doba was\na girl from Lodz, that much I know. She\u2019s the one that died. And it was funny with her,\nbecause she was looking for a brother, or her cousin, and she found a man with the same\nlast name as hers, thinking it\u2019s a -- a relative, and to the end she married him, he wasn\u2019t a\nrelative. She didn\u2019t even have to change her last name.",
        "Q: Hm. And how did you all team up, how did you and your sister sort of team up with\nthem, and become friends?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: How did you and your sister meet them, and how did you all become friends?",
        "A: We -- We met them while we were in Auschwitz standing 1n line, we were supposed\nto be forming lines of five, and we were sort of paired off with them, and from then on\nwe kept on being together, until -- until we were going to the same camp, and by accident\nbeing put in the same barrack. Then we went to Zazell for work. So just all this -- did\neverything together, just supporting, looking out for one another.",
        "Q: So then, one of them convinces you to go off with them. Where did you go, what\nhappened next?",
        "A: You mean, after I went to ber -- to Feldifing?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, we did travel with them. I don\u2019t know if it says there, on coal wagons, on freight\ntrains we traveled, because we didn\u2019t have any money, who get -- who gets money? Just\nthey gave us some clothing, and food, of course, the English. We did arrive in Feldifing,\nit was -- the condition -- the conditions were much better there. I can\u2019t say anything\nagainst the English except that the warmth wasn\u2019t forthcoming. They -- A little\ncompassion was less available for us. In the beginning they were shocked, you know, and\nvery much overcome. But later on it seems like, you know -- but on the American zone,\nthere was more the warmth of it. It was like -- you felt more that somebody cares.",
        "Q: How did that -- How could you tell that difference? What -- What sort of incidents\nwould happen, or things did you see that showed the difference between the two?",
        "A: They were more generous if you asked for something, or -- you could see the way they\nwere interested, that there was more compassion forthcoming from them, where over\nthere, it was like, very impersonal. That\u2019s what it was. Th-They used -- the Americans\nMP\u2019s used to come in into this place -- camp, because Feldifing had formed -- they told\nthem to form their own police force, and administration, [indecipherable] infirmary, and\nall. A -- There was a vocational school there. So the MP\u2019s used to come in with certain\ninformation, and they were very friendly towards everybody. It was -- It was really nice.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: In Feldifing? We came here in 1951. Actually, we started out in 1949, and never got --\nfirst we ended up in Bremerhaven, at that time -- and by that time, I had a little baby.",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s -- let\u2019s sort of take this in order.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Cause again, this is stuff you haven\u2019t --",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re asking me -- yeah --",
        "Q: I will. This is material that you haven\u2019t talked about in your video interview. Let\u2019s sort\nof just take it kind of chronologically.",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: If you could tell us approximate, sort of were you moved, and -- and how many\nmonths you were in each place, and --",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t move, we -- we lived til 1949, in Feldifing. The reason we stayed there\nthat long was because we didn\u2019t want to go to Poland, and we didn\u2019t want to stay in\nGermany, and we had no relatives any place, so we couldn\u2019t go until organization started\nto sponsor survivors. Then we registered, okay? My sister came right away, and when I\nregistered, and was ready to go, okay, we all ended up in Bremerhaven, but when it was\ntime to go on the boat, my baby got sick. So they don\u2019t let you on the boat with sick\nchildren, and because so many people were -- there was a camp in Bremerhaven -- now I\nforgot already where this place was called, but we stayed there. I\u2019Il have to remember.\nThinking. So, anyway, so many people together, and a lot of them had babies already,\nand a lot of children were sick with all these diseases that children get. And my child\nhappened to get every disease that were possible to be there. I never could go on a boat.\nEvery time I had to go on a boat, she was sick, you know? By the time I was able to, and\nthen my visa run out, my luck was, that up to this point, the visas were renewed\nautomatically. When my turn came, they said they don\u2019t do that any more, you have to go\nback to the point where we came from, and this is why we ended up again being in\nFeldifing, going back to the whole rigamarong again, all over. So --",
        "Q: Before you did come over here, where did you meet your husband?",
        "A: In Feldifing. Because we were also just walking around, looking for a relative, or a\nfriend, and we didn\u2019t find anyone. We didn\u2019t find anyone, and he was also -- he was from\na family of six children, he was the only one. So everyone looked for -- not finding a\nrelative, everybody looked for companionship, for someone to lean on. It wasn\u2019t a\nstorybook romances, it was people needing one another, that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: What was his name, and where was he from?",
        "A: My husband\u2019s name is Antrul, and he comes from Lodz, he is originally from Lodz,\nyes.",
        "Q: Do you remember in the camp, where you first encountered him, your first\nconversation, or -- how did you get to know each other?",
        "A: Well, just meeting, just saying hi, where are you from? You know? And we lived in\nFeldifing, in a little room, it was down -- actually, it was called the basement. There were\nbunkbeds, and the four of us lived there. We were still together. So, my friend that was\nlooking for Finkelstein, he used to come down there, and he used to bring some friends\nalong, and this is where we met, there were also, like places -- you know, the Americans\norganized dance halls, they wanted people to have some fun. They also brought movies\ninto the camp, and we had traveling survivor\u2019s orchestras giving concerts. So there was\nlike getting -- public getting together, and where are you from, asking where are you\nfrom, who are you, and this is the way people met.",
        "Q: And how long was it before you and your eventual husband decided to get married?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t very long. Maybe several months. There were no long courtships at that\ntime.",
        "Q: And you got married in the camp?",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "Q: What kind of ceremony did you have?",
        "A: Well, first we registered with the shtandersump in Germany, in -- in th-this little place\ncalled Shtarenberg, and then we just had a religious ceren -- ceremony in a Hasidic\nrabbi\u2019s study. We couldn\u2019t afford anything, we had no money. We had witnesses, I have\na ketuba, a religious one. I went according to -- I would be accepted in Israel now,\nbecause I went to all these ceremonies that were asked of me.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then, did you and your husband then get your own room in the camp, or\nhow did that work?",
        "A: Well, that didn\u2019t work that way, because there wasn\u2019t enough room in the camps. It\nwas like one big room, and somehow, they gave us some boards, and divide it into a wall,\nand on the other side another couple lived, and on this side, we lived. And this is the way\nit worked. You could hear every sneeze, and ya -- every word that was going on, but\nthere was no other way, until we could figure out where we wanted to go.",
        "Q: Not much of a honeymoon, I guess, huh?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What -- So once you were mar -- what year did you get married in?",
        "A: 46.",
        "Q: What month, do you remember?",
        "A: May.",
        "Q: So May of \u201946, so about a year after the war ended.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And then once you were married, how long did it take you to figure out what to do\nnext? What -- What discussions did you have about where you might go, and where you\nmight pick up your life?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t, because we didn\u2019t, but my husband went and enlisted with this police force\nthere, the displaced camp police force. And I went and registered into the vocational\nschool, and I took a course in sewing. So, for the time being, me and my other friend, the\none that died, we both took the course in sewing, and we both took on, later on,\nalterations for other people, for which we got -- used to get fruit, or money, or whatever,\nyou know, to have something. And my husband, after awhile they used to get some\nGerman marks from the German government, like from the state where we were,\nBavarian state, they used to get some German marks, because they sort of were on a\npilung of a police department, or whatever they called it, after awhile. And in the\nbeginning, there was no -- no talk of anything, because we still tried to figure out where\nare we, what do we supposed to be doing? Then later on, of course no one wanted to stay.\nPeople had relatives overseas, they sent papers for them, and this is what made us think\nwhat are -- what is going to be our future? What are we going to do? We did -- We didn\u2019t\nsee any way out. Finally, this came. It was just like a -- winning a lottery when we were\ntold we could register to the united -- to go to the United States, or Canada, or Australia. I\nreally thought that wasn\u2019t true. I di -- I didn\u2019t -- I always was the pessimist.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t seem pessimistic.",
        "A: Ah, well. But I really was, in the beginning. My sister, she was always the first one.\nThat\u2019s why, she registered first, and she -- she just came first, right away. Even if I would\nhave left in 1949, she left before me, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you and your husband ever talk about possibly going to Israel?",
        "A: We did in the beginning, but I don\u2019t think I would have been very good material,\nbecause I wasn\u2019t a strong person. I wanted to have a child, because everybody got killed,\nokay? So, after my daughter was born, I was three and a half months in the hospital. I\nwas the one that they thought would never survive. I was deadly sick after she was born.\nAnd so, when I finally recovered, the doctor said to me, \u201cNo more children, cause you\ndidn\u2019t recover like other people.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I could s -- take the illegal journey, first it\nwas Palestine, that I could take that. And now, finally that I got my life together, I wanted\nto live for something. And then I thought, let\u2019s go first to the United States, where I can\ntake a deep breath, relax, and maybe recover my strength. I can always go to Israel. But\nyou know, once you are settled somewhere, and your children are here, it\u2019s very hard to\npick up and go again.",
        "Q: What year was your first child born?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What year was she born, your child?",
        "A: My older daughter was born in 1949, my younger daughter in 1955.",
        "Q: And their names are?",
        "A: My older daughter\u2019s name is Marta, and my younger daughter\u2019s name 1s Sally.",
        "Q: And you said you wanted to have children because so many people had died?",
        "A: Well, I still would want children, regardless. I would have had more, not only two, but\nI -- I even th -- with the second one, it was very hard here in the United States, and I just -\n- I didn\u2019t think I would be able to do that. So, had to settle for that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But you did say earlier you wanted children --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- because so many people had --",
        "A: That\u2019s true, too. That 1s true, too. But under normal circumstances, I would have want\nchildren anyway.",
        "Q: Right. I understand that, I\u2019m just curious what those thoughts were. What was your\nthinking abo -- on that subject?",
        "A: Well, Jewish thinking 1s always, you have to have a namesake, you have to have\nsomeone to remember. And children are always named after departed ones. So that\u2019s --\nMy oldest daughter\u2019s name, Marta\u2019s actually Matel, it\u2019s after my mother. And my Sally is\nafter my grandmother.",
        "Q: You said that when you had your children, especially your first one, 1t was very\ndifficult --",
        "A: Very.",
        "Q: -- you were very sick. I\u2019m wondering what -- I mean, it\u2019s always an incredibly\nemotional time when, you know, someone has a child.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering if there were a whole extra set of emotions because this was right after\nthe Holocaust.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So many Jews were dead.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And if there were a lot of extra emotions, is -- can you describe what those were?",
        "A: They ver -- very sort of anxious emotions, because she was also sickly child, because I\nwas not in perfect health, and I always watched her and carried her to the doctor, and I\nput her -- I didn\u2019t have a bed, she slept in her buggy, or whatever. And I sat -- half the\nnights, I used to sit by that buggy and watch her, and when she moved her fingers, or\nmoved her head, I considered, oh what a miracle, this is mine, you know, my own, no one\ncan ever take this away from me. And it was -- most of the time when I looked at her, I\ncried. It was a miracle to me.",
        "Q: Did you see having children somehow, as you know, being a small part in, sort of, so\nmany Jews had been taken from the earth, and sort of helping to bring them back?",
        "A: Maybe, in a way, I would say that the Jewish people do not disappear completely, and\nwell, just for myself, I wanted, as a parent, to have a child. And it was, for me, to love\nand to have, and we always had good -- a good relationship with our children, and still\ndo.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s go back to you were -- you were talking about the process of coming to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: Yes. So, we registered, and like I said, we were in Bremerhaven, and we had to go\nback. We had to go ba -- go -- go to the same commission. We had to go and have chest\nx-rays, and all that stuff done again, and we had to travel from Feldifing into Munich, and\na place called the Funkazerner. Now, Funkazer-kazerner means soldier\u2019s place, you\nknow, where soldiers must have been housed at one time or another. This 1s where they\nhad their -- all the in -- and we had to go -- would you believe, we all had to go through a\nvery true screening. They had to make sure that we were who we were, and we were in\nthe concentration camps. Somehow they couldn\u2019t find my husband\u2019s background, so he\nhad to travel in Germany, to this place called Arelson, and bring the papers from there, ca\n-- so they ma -- make sure that he is who he 1s. It was so ironical, now that I think of it,\nhow many Nazis went through, that had no problems at all, and us, the survivors, they\nmade so many problems, trying to -- and one time, the second time when we went for a\nhearing before the INS, they were called, he asked me where I worked, you know? I said,\nin ha -- all the questions where I di -- wa -- the most work. I said, \u201cIn Hamburg.\u201d\n\u2018\u201cWhereabouts in Hamburg?\u201d See? And when I told him, he says, \u201cOh, yeah, I know the\nplace, I was there.\u201d He tried to catch me, if I\u2019m saying something wrong. That really hurt.",
        "Q: These were American officials?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And my husband was held back quite a few times, because he was a\npoliceman in the displaced camp, and at that time, the sentiment against the Communists\nwere very strong, and there was organiz -- Jewish organization called the Bundt, which\nwas more left, you know. And they had -- in May they had a May day parade, and\nbecause he has a -- was a policeman, they assumed he knows who these people were, and\nhe should give them names of those Bundists. My husband said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody.\u201d\nHe came home and told me that, after he was through. I said, \u201cEven if you knew, you\nshouldn\u2019t give them any names, because who wants to have a person that squeals, one on\nanother. He didn\u2019t know. You know, they had 24 hour duty. After he came home from\nduty, he slept most of the time, because he was tired. He was not in any social integration\nthere, no one was. We always tried to see where we -- what we wanted to do. So, he had\nno political interest, neither did I at that time. Of course, our sympathies were -- were\nwith Israel, at that time Palestine, but none of us were inclined to be Communist, or left,\nor whatever it was. So it took several times he called them back, making him tell him\nwho they were.",
        "Q: What was it like when you would -- you mentioned your husband had to go to another\nGerman town to get papers, and -- what was it like when you would be sort of circulating\nnow in Germany? What was the -- What was that like? What feelings did you have about\nthat?",
        "A: You mean when I go back to Germany\u2019?",
        "Q: No, I -- I mean at the time, back then, when you would --",
        "A: You mean --",
        "Q: -- go into German cities, or have contact with Germans?",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have much contact with them, and the ones that tried to be in touch\nwith us, of course, didn\u2019t know anything about it, what -- what was happening, none of\nthem ever did. They were already --",
        "Q: Yo-You\u2019re smiling as you say this.",
        "A: -- very innocent, they were very innocent, none of them knew anything, so -- but they\ncame in to the displaced camp, the women, and they tried to do our laundry, because\nthere were no facilities, just for something to eat, because we used to get all these CARE\npackages. The Americans were very good to us, they gave us many CARE packages, but\nthen every CARE package, there was so much of the same thing, that they couldn\u2019t\npossibly consume this. So we always exchanged it for something else that we needed.\nAnd this is what happens. So you had no oth -- other choice but to deal with the local\npopulation on that level.",
        "Q: And it sounds like it might have been kind of strained.",
        "A: It -- It -- It was, it was, yes.",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s -- let\u2019s pick up this story again, where you\u2019re -- you\u2019re trying to get to\nUnited States, so you go through the application process --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and eventually you do get to come.",
        "A: Eventually, because when we came again to be interviewed, there was this lady, the\nsecretary, and she was marry -- married to a Polish guy, to areal Polish guy, and I got to\ntalk to her, and then I said to her, what was happening. And she got really upset. She\nwent into this interviewer, and said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s strange that these poor people are being\nheld back, and you know they have nothing, they\u2019re poor, and they\u2019re survivors .All they\nwant to do is get out of here, and you holding them back, and you let go any Tom, Dick\nand Harry which is not Jewish, you letting them go.\u201d He sat there and thought about it,\nand then my husband came in, he did apologize to him, my husband told me. He said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cause you all this heartache. On the next transport you bil -- you\u2019ll be the\nfirst one on the list,\u201d and sure enough, you were, and this is where we went, to\nBremerhaven. And you know what happened? The day we were going to go -- before the\n-- the date that we were going on the boat, they checked the children, agenamy -- again,\nand my daughter had a temperature. Could you believe that? I sat up all night and cried,\nand gave her aspirins, and in the morning they checked her again. Well, the temperature\nhad gone, so they let me go on t-the boat. And let me tell you, all 10 days we traveled, on\nstormy seas, I thought I\u2019d never survive that. I\u2019m never going on another boat again. And\nthen the -- finally pulled in, and New York harbor, it quiet down, you know? And then\nmy husband -- of course we were not together, we traveled on a military boat, so the men\nwere separate, and the women were separate, and because I had a small baby, I was\nprivileged to have a cabin with another woman, separate, private. So, he came into the\ncabin, and if it wouldn\u2019t be for him, I think my child would die of s-starvation, cause I\ncouldn\u2019t lift my head from that bunk. So he came in, and he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so quiet now.\u201d\nWe have to come out on deck and see what was going on. If you -- I went out, and it was\nthe most gorgeous sight I\u2019ve seen. It was at dawn, you know, it\u2019s still dark outside. I\ncould see the lit up harbor, and the first thing, bright, and white lit up, was the Statue of\nLiberty. That was so gorgeous, I\u2019ll never forget that.",
        "Q: What month and year was this?",
        "A: We came at the end of April, 1951.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you came into the harbor, and --",
        "A: Of New York. And then we were met by representative, either they were UNRRA, or\nJoint, I don\u2019t know. This is what they call themself for short, I can\u2019t really tell you\nexactly how to say the whole name of them. And they took us to a hotel, we stayed in the\nhotel for several days to rest up. Actually, they wanted to send us to Trenton, New Jersey,\nbut my sister\u2019s destination was in Sheboygan. So she wanted very much for us to be\ntogether, and asked the local people here to intervene, so they would send us here. So we\ncame here. So they -- in New York they gave us tickets and put us on a train, and they put\nus On a passenger -- on a coach passenger train, you know, with a little baby, traveling all\novernight, sitting on a bench. She -- I didn\u2019t know where to lay her down, she cried all\nnight. And people were sitting, and -- and I didn\u2019t know a word of English, or -- or\nwhatever, and I was still very much a timid person out of a camp, looking around, being\nafraid these people are going to scream at me because my child is crying. You know, I\nwas very much afraid.",
        "Q: As someone who originally comes from New Jersey, I\u2019d have to say I think you\u2019re\nbetter off that you went to Wisconsin, but -- nobody from New Jersey wants to --",
        "A: [have a friend, my friend that was in camp with me, she lives in Englewood.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they tell you why they wanted you to go to Trenton?",
        "A: No. There were certain cities that took so many people in, and I guess they decided I\nshould go to Trenton, that was it. I don\u2019t know, but maybe I would have had better\nopportunities. We didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunities here. They have a small committee\nhere, they welc-welcomed us, and because my sister was here, they didn\u2019t even find us an\napartment right away, we had to stay with my sister. They gave my husband a job, and as\nfar as looking for a place, we had to do that ourselves. My husband job didn\u2019t earn\nnothing, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: Just a factory job. Well, we had no education. There was no one here that said, \u201cWell,\nwe'll -- we\u2019ll see that you get an education and meanwhile see that you have something\nto live on.\u201d Nobody did this here. So we had to right away go to work, and because his\nearnings weren\u2019t enough, I had to go sometimes and help out. What could I do? There\nwas nothing part time I could do in the evening, just babysit or clean somebody\u2019s house,\nthat was it. But then my children got bigger, and I went to work too, full-time, because\nthey were both in school. So I went full-time to work.",
        "Q: What were your -- What was it like being over here, you know, in a different country,\ndifferent culture?",
        "A: It was very hard, because let me tell you, in those days, people did not provide you\nwith social workers to get you adjusted, in a new country. We did all the adjusting all by\nourselves. Soon as we got a job, nobody bothered with us. That was it, you got a job,\nyou\u2019re making money, you got to do it on your own. We had people that were very\nhelpful in the places where we worked. They really -- People were kind, telling us how to\ndo -- especially, I met very nice people that said to me, imi -- wa -- I couldn\u2019t speak the\nEnglish, and this a big German town, let me tell you. It helped though, in the beginning,\nthat you could speak the language, you know, and communicate. But then we\ncommunicated and they said, \u201cIf you understand something in English, then say it. We\u2019ll\nhelp you.\u201d You know? We went for awhile to vocational school. It wasn\u2019t a great big\nhelp, it wasn\u2019t, because when you don\u2019t know the language, and people start the\ngrammar, and you don\u2019t even know what is a vowel, or a noun, or whatever it 1s, what\ngood is it to you? I had learned a lot from watching my neighbor\u2019s TV, seeing the\nmotions, and the repeat -- repeated words, and I also liked to read a lot. I started reading,\nI actually didn\u2019t know what I was reading, because the pronunciations here are so\ndifferent. But slowly I got it, and on my own, more on our own, we did it. That\u2019s true.\nBut we needed a vocational school because we could not apply for citizenship if we\ndidn\u2019t go to vocational school, and learn about the government, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you and your husband feel like, okay, now we\u2019re here, and we\u2019re\nAmericans, we want to be Americans?",
        "A: Yes, we did. We applied right away. Soon as we got our first papers, we did register\nright away. We came in \u201951, in 1957 we were citizens already. This 1s -- We wanted to\nbelong, we loved the country, it\u2019s wonderful. With all it\u2019s faults, it\u2019s the best place to be.\nAll the freedoms a person has, no place to be found.",
        "Q: Do you feel like you have a sort of special perspective on what it\u2019s like in this country,\ngiven where you came from, and what you lived through?",
        "A: You mean, what\u2019s going on now, or --",
        "Q: Or just in general.",
        "A: Well, I would say I love the freedoms, but sometimes the people abuse the freedoms\ntoo much already. They use any excuse to say that you infringe on their freedom. And I\nthink sometimes that people go too far in that respect. And another thing that nobody\nstops these people, because they say they\u2019re entitled to these --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: -- ocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fela Warschau. This is tape number two,\nside A.",
        "A: You mean, what\u2019s going on now, or --",
        "Q: Or just in general.",
        "A: Well, I would say I love the freedoms, but sometimes the people abuse the freedoms\ntoo much already. They use any excuse to say that you infringe on their freedom. And I\nthink sometimes that people go too far in that respect. And another thing that nobody\nstops these people, because they say they\u2019re entitled to these freedoms. It\u2019s like being\nhelpless, you know? With all the freedoms, you\u2019re still helpless to stop something evil\nthat\u2019s going on.",
        "Q: Are you thinking of specific things?",
        "A: All these hate groups. All these things that are -- insults being, or -- or going on public\ntelevision, or on -- on the internet, online, and broadcasting their hate messages, and\nnothing can be done about it, you know\u201d? Poisoning young people\u2019s -- children\u2019s minds\nwith such garbage\u2019? And children are vulnerable. They just don\u2019t go and research, and try\nto find out what is the truth, they -- they really get taken with something like that.",
        "Q: Does that type of thing remind you of things that happened in Europe before the war?\nWere you very conscious then of what was developing in Europe?",
        "A: Well, in Europe, most of the time the Jews had no rights. I would say we were called\ncitizens, but we had no right, we were always second class citizens, as far as I remember.\nWhen I was a child, you could hear em -- being said, Jew, Jew, all the time, you know?\nAnd even my school, I was always good in languages, you know, always got the best\ngrade in Polish language, so our teacher, an educated woman would say to the class,\n\u2018\u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed that this Jew has the best mark in Polish language?\u201d So we were\nalways aware -- always made aware of it, that we were Jews. Ya -- In court, you were not\nbelievable, because you were a Jew. If anyone had something against you, you were lost,\nunless you could bribe the judge, or whatever.",
        "Q: So you were -- It\u2019s now, I guess, the 50\u2019s, you and your husband are both working,\nwhat kind of job did you get?",
        "A: Factory jobs.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s all we could do. That\u2019s all we were able to do. I could not go work in a office, I\ndidn\u2019t have enough understanding of the office work, you see? And you needed the\ntyping, which I didn\u2019t have. So, wherever the money was coming from, this 1s where we\nwent. I ended up working in a place that manufactured plastic things, and we were\ninspecting all the ready products, making them ready for shipment. So that\u2019s what I did\nfor 29 years.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: Same job?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What about your husband, did he stay in the same factory, or did he move around\nsome?",
        "A: No, he -- he changed, because thank God, that first factory we b-barely -- we chased\nthe rainbow all the time, very poor hours, very poor pay, but then, thank the lord, they\nwent on strike. That was the turning point. Nobody knew when this was going to end, so I\nurged him to go and look for a different job, and then he found another job, which was\nmuch better. If he had that job in the beginning, I could have gone to school and learned\nsomething, but then, by that time, we had children going to school. So we wanted them to\ngo, we did, the both of them went to universities, we saw to that.",
        "Q: What was the second job that your husband had?",
        "A: It was on a -- It\u2019s f -- for them -- for a manufacturing machines to package things. You\nknow, like packaging toilet paper, or packaging foodstuff, and all that. They were\nmanufacturing those machines, that\u2019s what they were doing.",
        "Q: When -- Once you were here, and had sort of established your life, what sort of social\ncontacts did you have? Did you get to know many Jewish families, how did that work?",
        "A: No, no. Most of the time we were just -- there were a couple of other survivors, we\nsort of circulated among ourselves, that was it. I was -- I would say I wasn\u2019t even invited\nany place with the local people. I -- I don\u2019t know about the others, I just know we\nweren\u2019t. And most of the friends that we made, we were invited, were not even Jewish.\nWe had a lot of Gentile friends right away in the beginning, helping us a lot. And like\nwhen we bought this house here, actually we hardly had any payment, and people helped\nus paint it, and remodel, and do everything, without anything, and those were not Jewish\npeople that helped us.",
        "Q: Why do you think that happened, was it just sort of accidental?",
        "A: I have no idea. I think the people here, themself, weren\u2019t that well off before the war.\nThe war gave them opportunities to better themself, and maybe they were busy themself,\ntrying to get somewhere. They were just so absorbed in their trying to make it, that they\nhad no time for anybody else. That\u2019s the only way I can figure.",
        "Q: Hm. I have a note here, this is from the museum that I -- I guess maybe you mentioned\nthis in wa -- one of your other interviews that you had, most of your friends here were not\nJewish, and it says that you said you think that\u2019s the way it should be, and they want to\nknow what do you mean by that?",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "Q: Do you remember that? Saying that?",
        "A: That\u2019s the way it should be?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I said that. Well, because I think we need to communicate with people other than\nJewish people. I had a great need to understand about other religions, and about other\nplaces, because in Europe we were completely isolated from that. And I learned a great\ndeal from my friends, they learned a great deal from me. And we you learn to respect one\nanother, because of that, and it doesn\u2019t matter what religion they are really, we are always\ngood friends. We do --",
        "Q: With your friends, your non-Jewish friends --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- during this period, did they ask you much about what happened to you during the\nwar, did you talk about it much?",
        "A: Some of them did. And some of them said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it now, it hurts too much.\nMaybe later on.\u201d And finally, I don\u2019t know how -- it started with me talking. Do you\nwant me to talk about that? I don\u2019t know, do you?",
        "Q: Sure. Sure, go ahead.",
        "A: Well, there was a time when they were speculating about Dr. Mengele, because he\nwas the one in Auschwitz, doing all the experiments, if he was still alive, and that was in\n1985, where that was a big uproar all over the world, trying to figure out where he 1s, or\nwhat\u2019s going on. And the local paper here, wanted to write a story tying in some one of\nthe survivors with Mengele. The only one that was in Auschwitz here, was I. So someone\ndirected a newspaper lady to me. She came and interviewed me, and we talked. I did tell\nher that Mengele met every transport, or, at that time, I wouldn\u2019t know who he was. But\nI\u2019m sure he was there. So she took my life story, she wrote a big article, and she said,\n\u201cTt\u2019ll be in the paper.\u201d Made headlines, you know, it made -- the next day it made\nheadlines, and I started getting phone calls from schools. The first school was in\nHoward\u2019s Grove here, that asked me to come and speak. The teacher -- And I said to her,\n\u201cT don\u2019t feel like coming. I have never spoken in public, and I really -- are you sure you\nwant me to come?\u201d So she said, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201d You know, my first presentation was maybe\n10 or 15 minutes. I was shaking in my boots. But from then on, apparently I did\nsomething right, because she keeps on asking me to come back every year. From then on\nI keep on going. And from then on, from word of mouth, other schools, and it gets to be\nmore and more every year. So, that\u2019s the way it happens with me going out and speaking.",
        "Q: How often do you do it now?",
        "A: Soon as school starts, I get phone calls, and I would say in an average, about five\ntimes a month, for sure. But sometimes it\u2019s even more.",
        "Q: These are grammar schools, high schools?",
        "A: Universities, high schools, grammar schools, junior highs, everything. Also church\ngroups, organizations, and civic clubs, all of them. I found many of those.",
        "Q: Are there certain things that -- how do you do it? Do you go in and talk of -- make\nsure to talk about certain things, do you introduce yourself and take questions, how does -\n- how do you do it?",
        "A: I -- I -- I -- Ido my presentation, mainly the story of my life. I start out just with a\nlittle introduction, and then I talk about myself, and through the liberation. And if it\u2019s a\nschool, then I talk to them about life here, and what they have here, how they should --\ncomparing my life, and how I view the United States when I came here, what we have\nhere, and how appreciative they should be, and really appreciate the life and the schools,\nand everything they have. And point out all these hate groups to them, try to make them\nunderstand that before they commit themself to something like that, they should study,\nand check out the archives and documents, to make sure what is the truth. I always\nemphasize all these things to them. So, and then there\u2019s always a period of questions, of\nlook it up, this picture there, where all these children are? You see that? That was on a\nschool where about 50 of them crowded around, wanted my autograph.",
        "Q: You say make a p -- a presentation, what kinds of things do you tell them about? Do\nyou tell them about being in the camps, and what you saw, and --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- I\u2019m also curious how they react. Have -- Have they heard much of this before, or --\nor are they sort of in the dark about this to start with?",
        "A: Well, some of them get -- take a unit in it beforehand, before I come, so they will be --\nthey have some background on it. Most of them do. And they prepare questions ahead of\ntime, which I -- after I\u2019m through, I do answer questions for those children, and they are -\n- I get tons of letters from them, and when I read those, I can see that they paid attention,\nbecause they quote me sometimes, and telling me how appreciative they are that now that\nthey listened to my story, and that they will never say they\u2019re hungry again, or they will\nnever say that they\u2019re underprivileged because they don\u2019t have certain things, and how\nlucky they are to live in freedom. Thanking me for coming and telling my story and\ncalling me a hero for surviving, and maybe that was my goal, that I would be able to\ncome and tell people about this, so people finally realize that we -- we should not hate\none another. This is the most important thing I tell them, that hate is a terrible thing.",
        "Q: When you talk to them about what happened, do they seem very shocked? Do -- Do\nthey ever have trouble believing that this type of thing actually happens, or --",
        "A: Some of them say, \u201cUntil you came, it was hard for me to believe, but you\u2019re a living\nwitness to it, so it must be true.\u201d Because what reason, or what would I get out of it,\ncoming here and telling a story like that? So they say, \u201cWe are very much convinced\nnow.\u201d Doubters, you know? And I think what makes me feel good is those responses, and\nwhat makes me more feel good 1s that after walking somewhere in the street, or walking\ninto a store, when a person comes over and says, I heard you speak five years ago in this\nschool, and she still can recognize my face, and remembers what I said, that\u2019s the biggest\nreward a person can get.",
        "Q: So do some of the students actually say to you, I did have doubts that the Holocaust\nhappened, or --",
        "A: Not very many. Very seldom someone will say that, yes.",
        "Q: How does it come up? Do they say that they looked into it and wondered if it\nhappened, or -- I\u2019m just curious where this sort of line of thought comes from.",
        "A: Some of them say, \u201cI have a friend that says that\u2019s not true, it never happened. But\nyou\u2019re here, you told me that. I can see it\u2019s true.\u201d So.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s go back to sort of your -- your family history again.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You\u2019re here, your husband is working, you\u2019re working. Your kids are going to school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Eventually they went to college, where did they go?",
        "A: My older daughter went to the University of Madison, and my younger daughter went\nto Milwaukee.",
        "Q: And where are they today\u201d?",
        "A: Both are in New York City.",
        "Q: What do they do?",
        "A: Well, I tell you, my older daughter graduated in social work. She did that for a couple\nof years and decided it was too heartbreaking, and too hard. She did not want that. So she\nwent back, took some classes, and went into insurance and investment, and she\u2019s doing\nvery good. My younger daughter works in a law firm.",
        "Q: What -- What was it like when they were growing up, regarding the fact that you and\nyour husband were Holocaust survivors? How much did you talk about 1t with your\nchildren, and how did you handle that whole situation?",
        "A: Well, I did not tell them a lot when they were much younger. The only thing that I\nalways instilled in them, that we are all people, and it doesn\u2019t matter who we are,\neverybody is a friend, if they\u2019re nice people. And they were like that, they made easy\nfriends with non-Gentiles, and gen -- and -- and Jewish people. My kids had tons of\nfriends coming to this place. They had a bedroom, very little room, because this is what\nwe could afford, and the room was small, it -- as a matter of fact, it had bunk beds,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t fit in two beds. But they always had friends, and some of e-even slept\nover, in their place -- in that jammed place, because they liked to be with them. So it was\nalways happy, and full of kids around here, when they were growing up. I wa -- I was\nhappy, too, believe me. Once they left, it was very traumatic to get adjusted.",
        "Q: What -- When did you start talking to them about what happened? How did you and\nyour husband talk about it, about what happened to you during the war?",
        "A: Well, we just tried to tell them that -- we had to tell them, you know, because they\nused to ask about grandparents, other relatives. So this is what came out. That\u2019s what we\nhad to tell them.",
        "Q: They would ask where their relatives were, or why they didn\u2019t have them?",
        "A: Of course. Why do -- Why don\u2019t they have a grandma? Why don\u2019t they have a-aunt --\nmore aunts, just one aunt, and one uncle, where other children they associate with have\nbig families, and cousins a lot, and so you have to tell them. Not when they were real\nlittle, they wouldn\u2019t understand that.",
        "Q: Around what age did you start talking about?",
        "A: I would say by the time they were 10, or something like that. Still not everything. 10\nyear old child still isn\u2019t able to comprehend everything.",
        "Q: As the years went on, and they got older, did they continue to be curious about it, did\nthey ask you to tell them?",
        "A: They did, but when I sometimes expressed fear, they always said, \u201cOh Mom, you\u2019re\nliving in the United States, don\u2019t worry about anything here.\u201d They felt very secure here.\nFirst of all, my older daughter, she was a little baby when we came, and my other\ndaughter was born here, so she never knew about, you know, being -- bu -- she -- the\nother one didn\u2019t know either. She only said in the beginning, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m a German\ncitizen, how terrible.\u2019 Because she was born there.",
        "Q: What about you yourself, when it would come up? Did -- Would you prefer not to\nthink about it, or not to be reminded of it?",
        "A: Well, in the beginning, none of us really wanted to talk a lot about it, because it\nbrought a lot of heartache. It still does. It -- That will never go away, as long as we will\nlive, never. Beca -- It\u2019s hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts, and you\u2019re a 13 year\nold girl, and the war ends, and you\u2019re an adult on your own, and there\u2019s no one to turn to\nfor advice, what to do, how -- what to do with your life, or how to -- to associate with\npeople, or whatever. So it\u2019s very hard. My young years are gone, from childhood into\nadulthood. It\u2019s -- It -- It is -- A lot of the people can\u2019t understand that, what we missed\nout on.",
        "Q: Do you ever have dreams about the war?",
        "A: Oh, yes, lot of them. Lot of dreams.",
        "Q: Do you remember certain ones, or --",
        "A: Sometimes I dream I\u2019m there. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in a camp, but I\u2019m trying to hide.\nThey\u2019re coming, I\u2019m trying to hide, and every time I\u2019m hiding, I know they coming near\nto find me, and I\u2019m running, trying to find a different hiding place. And I\u2019m running that\nfar, one time I was running so fast I woke up, my heart was beating so fast, I could hardly\ncatch my breath. This is what woke me up. There\u2019s many other dreams, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you still have dreams today, about --",
        "A: Once in awhile, yes. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you think that -- obviously, you know, in many ways it\u2019s a good experience, do\nyou think that it\u2019s been a good thing that you\u2019ve become a bit of a public speaker about\nthe Holocaust? Has that helped you in any way, sort of sort things out, or deal with it?",
        "A: Well, La -- I\u2019m very gratified that I do something good, I think I\u2019m doing something --\nbringing a little understanding to children, and some adults. And believe me, some 0 --\nsome of the adults, which I\u2019m very shocked, until I come, say they never heard of it.\nWould you believe that? I had one college girl come over and say she never heard of the\nHolocaust until I came and spoke there. This is gratifying, very much so, and another\nthing, I think is -- when you speak about it, it\u2019s just like therapy, talking it out. At -- It\nfeels like I\u2019m talking my heartache out, and after that 1t makes me feel I\u2019m a little more\ncalm, because of that. It gives me a better feeling, trying to make people understand what\nwas it like.",
        "Q: Do you read much about the Holocaust, and what about films, and documentaries, and\nthat sort of thing?",
        "A: I have tons of books on that subject, and documentaries, I have several. Also, I went to\nsee \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d of course, and there\u2019s a lando -- on PBS, there\u2019s a lot of\ndocumentaries. I try to watch, but sometimes I don\u2019t any more, because I get very bad\ndreams, and sometimes I can\u2019t fall asleep any more. You know, the older you get, and\nbecause we are retired, our minds are more activated towards these happenings. And\nespecially something like that, it triggers so much, that you can\u2019t sleep, or when you fall\nasleep, there are many nightmares.",
        "Q: Do you -- Do you feel that what you lived through, and what you saw, had any great\naffect on how -- you know, it\u2019s a big question, I guess, maybe it\u2019s too big, but how you\nsee the world, or -- or how you see other human beings, or just humanity in general. Do\nyou think that you saw things one way before the war, and it was drastically different\nafterward, or what -- what\u2019s that been like for you?",
        "A: Well, as a Jewish person, before the war, I knew -- like I said, I knew I wasn\u2019t equal to\nthe others, because I wasn\u2019t treated that way, but I always felt I was, in myself. It wa -- It\nwas instilled into me by my parents, that we are good people, and we did not do anything\nwrong, it\u2019s just too bad that other people can\u2019t recognize that. But when I came here, I\nrejoiced in all this freedom, I also look very cautiously on everything, because of the\nthings that I went through. I\u2019m always a little skeptical, and afraid. I\u2019m still afraid,\nbecause of what\u2019s happening with -- with this mushrooming groups of hate, what is going\nto happen? And if they wouldn\u2019t someday prevail. This is what bothers me a lot.",
        "Q: I imagine you\u2019ve returned to Europe.",
        "A: I was, mm-hm.",
        "Q: How often have you gone? Have you gone to Germany\u201d",
        "A: I -- We went -- The first time I went back to Poland in 1978, and my hometown, there\nwas one Jew there, of all the people. And there was no cemetery any more, just all the\nstones, just -- they were made on a sidewalk, you know? And after awhile, they were\ntaken out. This Jew asked the Polish government after the war, so he went, and they just\nlaid there, pilots of rubble, you don\u2019t know where they belong. I wanted to go there\nbecause my grandpa was the only one that died natural death, and I wanted to see his\ngrave, but I couldn\u2019t see anything. And I did travel to Poland, I -- I went back to\nAuschwitz, I went back there.",
        "Q: This was in 1978?",
        "A: Eight. It was -- It was very hard to do that, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s from -- where I lef -- lost\nmy whole family. I wanted to go and say a prayer for them, I wanted to do that. Yes,\nthat\u2019s what I did.",
        "Q: What must have -- What was it like to walk into that camp again?",
        "A: Very bad, thinking that I\u2019m back in it, you know? The first thought was, is it really --\nam I really walking here as a free person? It was a eerie feeling, yes.",
        "Q: Was your husband with you?",
        "A: No, not the first time, he didn\u2019t want to go, mm-mm.",
        "Q: When you went to your hometown in Poland, did you see any of the houses, or\nbuildings you remember, places where your family --",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: -- used to live, that were still there?",
        "A: Oh, sure. The marketplace there, the house where -- the place where we lived is there.\nI couldn\u2019t get in, because the people that lived there were working, it was locked, you\nknow. And later on, or even if they were, they were afraid to open the doors. They\nthought maybe I came for something. But it\u2019s there, the building is there, I saw it. I\nwalked around the streets, I walked around where my school was, in the neighborhood,\nall -- all of it, everything\u2019s there, just like I left it. I always say, the little town of Ozercuv\nwithout the Jews, is just like a piece in the Twilight zone, for -- 1t\u2019s teeming with life, you\nwalk out a minute on the street, and come back, a-and it\u2019s dead, nobody is there. And this\nis the way it\u2019s -- did strike me, at that time.",
        "Q: So it actually had not changed much --",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: Since the war, or it has?",
        "A: I would say they improved a little bit, the -- the roads, the s -- the buildings, they\nrenovated some of that. But otherwise, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- That\u2019s fine. The cat is investigating. But you\u2019re saying otherwise it\u2019s what?",
        "A: Otherwise it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s exactly the same. Life goes on without the Jews, you\nknow? It was teeming with Jewish people before the war. There was a lot of industry.\nThe biggest factory of textiles was owned by a Jewish man, and several -- quite a few\nhundred people, Gentiles, all of them were working there and making a living of that.\nNow the factory belongs to the government. It\u2019s still there, so --",
        "Q: How do you feel about Poland and Germany, and Poles and Jews in general?",
        "A: Well, I feel like that they say they suffered, it\u2019s true. Polish people were also\nexterminated, but they were not exterminated, some of them, for the same reason, not\nbecause they wanted to exterminate a race. They did it because they were afraid of\nuprisings. Th-They did it to political people, and whatever they -- like I always hear\nhomosexuals, or whoever went, they\u2019re going against them. That\u2019s why they did it to the\nPolish people, the intelligentsia, that they shouldn\u2019t be sort of wising up the loc -- the\npopulation to revolts. Those they exterminated. But especially for the reason, just to wipe\nout a race, they didn\u2019t do this to the Polish people like they did to the Jewish people. So,\nwhat I would have to say, that -- in the respect, they didn\u2019t lose what we lost. They still\nhave a country, where we got to be people without homes, no place to go.",
        "Q: What about Germany? Other people I\u2019ve interviewed, who went through the\nHolocaust, either avoid it all together, or if they are there, they -- they get out as quickly\nas they can. They don\u2019t -- you know --",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t in Germany last time when I was there. I felt that I didn\u2019t want to go and see\nthe country, because I always felt bitter about this big martial plan, where I said, we sat in\nthe displaced camps, with nowhere to go, and here all these millions are being poured\nback in the perpetrator of all these atrocities, making them prosperous, where they sat\nhome, in their own homes. They lost people in the war, they lost homes, of course.\nPeople got killed in the bombings, but they did it to themself, they have no one else to\nblame for it. Still they had a country, they had homes, they had mothers, they had fathers.\nAnd here we were helping them back, to get back to wealth, and here, we that lost\neverything. And they shed our blood. We are sitting in Germany, in displaced camps,\nwith nowhere to go. I felt very, very bitter about that.",
        "Q: When -- You mentioned that your husband did go with you to Europe later on?",
        "A: He -- Yes, he did, later on, he -- we went three years ago, we went. And then that time\nI did go into Germany, because I wanted to see the displaced camp where we lived for so\nmany years, after the war. That\u2019s the only reason I went in there. Otherwise, I had no -- I\nhave no business in Germany.",
        "Q: So you and your husband went to the camp together -- went back?",
        "A: We went back to the camp together, yes, mm-hm. And we traveled. We did go back to\nPoland again. He wanted to go back to Lodz, where he lived. There was a little street, a\nlittle side street, in that big city, the whole street was demolished, there was nothing there\nbut the empty lot. He was just so traumatized when he saw that.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFela Warschau. This is tape number two, side B. -- later on?",
        "A: Yes, he did, later on, we -- we went three years ago, we went. And then, that time, I\ndid go into Germany, because I wanted to see the displaced camp where we lived for so\nmany years, after the war. That\u2019s the only reason I went in there. Otherwise, I had no -- I\nhave no business in Germany.",

There was a little street, a\nlittle side street, in that big city, the whole street was demolished, there was nothing there\nbut the empty lot. He was just so traumatized when he saw that. And of course, we\ntraveled -- since we were there, we went to law -- to Warsaw, we looked at the Warsaw\nghetto buildings, and all the historical places.",
        "Q: Sounds like it was a very emotional trip for both of you.",
        "A: It was. I don\u2019t intend to go back there again. I don\u2019t think I could take that.",
        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019m curious what your reaction is. You know, we\u2019re doing this interview, right\nnow there is a supposed peace plan in Kosovo, but for the last, you know, few months\nespecially --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The Albanians were driven out of Kosovo --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and there have been a lot of references back to what happened in World War Two,\nby commentators, and politicians, or whatever. And when things like this happen in the\nworld, or especially a story like that, in -- in -- in Europe, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019ve been\nfeeling while this has been in the news, and what your reaction has been.",
        "A: Come on, anyone that compares this to a Holocaust doesn\u2019t think straight, because\nKosovo, those two factions, are people that have their land, and each one is fighting for\npossession and power. They fighting each other, right, and it\u2019s -- they\u2019re shedding blood,\nwhich is unnecessary. Things could have been resolved peacefully, but people are too\nhateful, okay. I am very upset about children and people being killed, but don\u2019t ever\ncompare this to the Holocaust. The Jews had no country, we did not start a war with --\nstart a war with Hitler. We were citizens of each country that we lived in, and this is -- we\ntried to live peacefully, we had nothing against anyone. We were simply killed, and tried\nto be exterminated, because we were Jews, simply. The goal -- Hitler\u2019s goal was to\nexterminate the Jewish race. We were not fighting for property, or for a country. We did\nnot have a country. Kosovo, and the Serbs, they have countries, right? They lived side by\nside each other, and each one wanted to dominate, and this is what started it. They fought\none another, okay\u2019? And they -- Whatever happened there, it\u2019s their own fault. They\nbrought it upon themself, I feel sorry for all the people, for the -- like I said, for the little\nchildren -- innocent children -- innocent people being killed. When I see that, I get very\nupset, because it does remind me of World War Two, and of the killings, but you can\nnever compare it to the Holocaust, never.",
        "Q: What about the argument that some people have made that of course this isn\u2019t like the\nHolocaust, but if countries had acted when whole populations were being persecuted in\nthe past, then a lot could have be-been avoided. And this whole notion that now, you\nknow, something should be done, and it shouldn\u2019t be permitted, do you -- what about that\nargument?",
        "A: I think that -- I-I\u2019m all for helping, I\u2019m all for helping, because I remember how\nhelpless we were. We looked towards England, and towards the United States, thinking\nany minute that they will come in, and it will be done swiftly, and that we would not have\nto suffer all this. But you see, the problem was that Hitler was bluffing, and the world\nwas afraid, and they let them get away with everything. And he got so big and strong\nbecause -- and it was all the other countries\u2019 fault that they let them get that far.\nEverybody stood by and let them just do it. Nobody interfered. This is what I\u2019m trying to\nsay. If they would interfere right away, so much bloodshed would not have happened.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying -- we have to see, we have to interfere. Of course, I don\u2019t go much\nfor Americans being killed over there. It\u2019s a big tragedy. But I think we have created the\nUnited Nations, all the countries together, should see to it that there should not be any\nwars, and any bloodshed. They should interfere.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Does -- Were you very -- Before the war, were you and your family very\nreligious?",
        "A: Yes, we were. Very Orthodox.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And, are you still, or --",
        "A: I\u2019m not, I\u2019m more Conservative now, because there is no other way, especially here.\nWell, I mean, I keep kosher in the house. When we go out, there is no kosher restaurants\nhere. So we just try to eat whatever possible we can. But as far as that, I try to observe the\nSabbath. We go to Temple, we belong to the Temple. I also have been a member of the\nSisterhood of the Hadassah. I have been -- I have been the past five years the president of\nthe Hadassah, also. And I have been involved in my children\u2019s -- I used to be a 4H leader\nonce, for my younger daughter. In -- And all the other things. The Girl Scouts, and\neverything, whatever possibly I could.",
        "Q: One thing I wonder about it, you know, given what you went through during the war,\nwhat you saw happen, what you experienced first-hand, did that -- how did that affect, or\ndid it affect your notion of God?",
        "A: Well, after I was liberated, didn\u2019t affect me anything. I just didn\u2019t believe in anything.\nI couldn\u2019t figure out a merciful God looking down could let all of this happens. And if He\nhas a hand in all this, He\u2019s the ruler, and make things happen, why did He let all this\nhappen? I couldn\u2019t cons -- justify that, and I couldn\u2019t understand. And I -- My doubts\nwere, 1s there a God? If He was there, why did He let that happen? Very much, I was very\nangry at God, let me tell you.",
        "Q: And then, what\u2019s happened since then? Do you still feel the same way\u201d?",
        "A: You sort of -- You have to have something to believe in, otherwise there\u2019s -- there\u2019s\nnothing to live for. I -- I think you have to. And it\u2019s not that I justify what happened, but\nthen you start thinking, and you think there have to be some powers above, that are still\nruling this world, and why this happened, I will never know. So there -- there\u2019s so much\nmystery in this world, and a person has to believe in something.",
        "Q: So, do you feel like you stopped being angry at God?",
        "A: Slowly.",
        "Q: But there\u2019s no great answer. I mean, I guess what I\u2019m wondering, do you think, in\nwhat happened, was there some meaning 1n this, or it was just this incredible outburst of\nevil, and it doesn\u2019t mean anything, or --",
        "A: I -- I still can\u2019t figure out why it happened. The rabbi\u2019s explanation is that God created\nus with two wills, one good, and one bad, and it\u2019s up to you which way we go, okay? So,\nbut why did the bad got the upper hand, I can\u2019t figure that out.",
        "Q: Just to go back during, you know, all the years you -- you lived here, and you\u2019re\nraising a family, --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and you know, solid citizen of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and all that, any other -- any\nstories that you want to tell, or any incidents, or things you remember, or -- or stuff you\nfelt at the time that somehow hasn\u2019t come up in our conversation, that you think is worth\nmentioning?",
        "A: Incidents about what?",
        "Q: Anything.",
        "A: I -- I think most of the time, I encountered good people, and through my traveling, I\nmet a lot of people that stick to me, and are friends. We\u2019re in touch, they come and visit\nme, they invite me to their homes. And I\u2019m very happy about that, most of them are\nschoolteachers, and all these other people that -- and when I say -- sometimes make\ncomment that I\u2019m amazed, you know, educated people like that, they really want to be\nmy friends, and they answer me, in a ways, you are more educated than we are. So, I feel\nvery humble, you know, that -- when they tell me that. And I -- The only regret may be\nliving in a small town. Right now, I don\u2019t, because we retired, but when I was younger, I\nfigured, if we would have been in a larger city, maybe we would have had a better\nopportunity to better ourselves financially, because in bigger cities, there were larger\ncommittees, and there were other ways the newcomers were treated. So, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe we would have been better off. But then, you don\u2019t know the language, and you\ndon\u2019t -- you don\u2019t have money to move around, you just stay where you are. And once\nyou're settled, it\u2019s hard to move.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I think in one of your video interviews, you mentioned that before you came\nhere -- they have a little quote here, that you said that you had heard wonderful things\nabout the United States.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: And we\u2019d like to know, what had you heard?",
        "A: My mother used to tell about inventions, people discovered this, or that, or made some\ngadgets, you know how they work. And my father was always busy working, because in\nPoland we had to work many hours to make a living, you know? So he had no time to\nread the paper, and my mom used to sit next to him while he was working, and read the\npaper to him loud. And then when she read about something like that, she should -- used\nto shake her head, and said, \u201cOnly in the United States, things like that could happen.\nThis must be some wonderful place.\u201d You know? And lada -- some of the people that\nimmigrated before the war had relatives sending back letters, and telling him all about the\nbuildings here, and all the things, what was happening. So she always thought it was a\nwonderful place to be, and I was very much impressed by it, and that was always in my\nmind, what she said. When we had a choice of going places, I always wanted to come\nhere.",
        "Q: So, partly because of what she had --",
        "A: What my mother used to read, and there were all these positive things about what she\nhad said.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then, when -- in the first few years you were here, do you think that the\nUnited States lived up to the advance billing, or not?",
        "A: Oh, I would say very much so, because you know, we lived on a little place, where\neverything was primitive. There wasn\u2019t running water, there were no flush toilets, there\nwas nothing. And I came here, and saw all that you could have, you know, refrigerators,\nyou know, and gas stoves. There was never anything like that when I was a little girl.\nRunning water in the house, a -- a -- a bathroom, and bathtub in the house, where we had\na big tub, you know, all the time. So, I thought it was wonderful, oh. And even now,\nwhen I sit in my dreams, such foolish things, I try to imagine I\u2019m talking to my mother,\nthat she\u2019s sitting next to me, and I\u2019m saying to her, \u201cLook Mom, how wonderful. All you\nhave to do is press a button, and your clothes gets washed. Can you see all these\nwonderful things that are here?\u201d It\u2019s just my mind always thinks back, and I\u2019m trying to\ncarry on a conversation with her, in my mind.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the cat\u2019s name?",
        "A: Sasha.",
        "Q: She had something -- She -- She -- She wants to add something to the conversation, I\nthink.",
        "A: No, he -- he wants to go in there, I think my husband\u2019s in there.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. Well, I think we\u2019ll be done in a -- in a minute or two.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: I think we\u2019ll be done in a minute or two.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine, no problem. He\u2019s very nosy, he likes to investigate things. See?",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, he\u2019s checking out my tape recorder. So, you say you have dreams where\nyou\u2019re actually -- you\u2019re showing things to your mother?",
        "A: I'm carrying on a conversation with my mother, or even with my father, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, when you came here, you loved it, there were all these amazing sort of\nmaterial things.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But was there -- was there anything you missed, is there stuff that -- or some aspect of\nlife that -- that you had in Europe, that you feel is -- doesn\u2019t exist so much here, or\nanything like that?",
        "A: Well, I would say, in the beginning maybe not, because the closeness with the families\nwas always there, even in -- and the other people\u2019s lives here. People were much closer in\nfamilies than they are now. Children and parents were together, things were done\ntogether, and I was always invited to people\u2019s homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that.\nEverybody sat down at the table, the children were there, our children were there. And s -\n- \u00a7 -- conversing afterwards. So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn\u2019t have,\nit was compensating very much. The only hard time was when it came to our holidays.\nSo, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the table, and you thought of the\nwonderful times you had at home, surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition. And\nall of a sudden, all of this is gone, and that\u2019s what it is, hard facts of life.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Is there anything else that we haven\u2019t talked about, that you\u2019d like to talk\nabout?",
        "A: You know, off-hand, I can\u2019t think of it, but probably by the time you\u2019re gone, I would\nsay I should have said this, or I should have said that, and that\u2019s what probably will\nhappen. I just -- I don\u2019t know. I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who\nthink time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that 1t should be\nleft behind. You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don\u2019t have any\ngrandchildren, it\u2019s hard to take this. They just elected to be career women. Yeah, I would\nlike to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I\ncompensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know\nabout it anyway. So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me. And\nmany schools also tape me, and they have that on their files. And I go, for the fourth time,\nI went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University. And they always tape it, they considered\nthis a lecture. And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they\nfile in their files there, so that -- that\u2019s something that I think is very good.",
        "Q: You know, it -- it has been so many years, and the people who did the live through it,\nwho are still alive, obviously are not going to be around forever.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier when we were talking, that you\u2019ve always still -- and your\nchildren used to try to reassure you about it, been a little apprehensive about what could\nhappen, what --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you know, somehow something similar happening -- happening in the future. I\u2019m\nwondering if -- what your feelings are also about once all the people who actually lived\nthrough this --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- are gone, and whether the memory will persist, or will it be forgotten?",
        "A: I think maybe for awhile it will persist, but I\u2019m afraid with time, it might just be\nsomething in the archives that now and then, someone will look it up for some reference.\nThis is the way it probably will be, sadly. I say that very sadly. In the beginning, maybe,\nthe first several years after we are gone, it will be still carried on, but later on, I don\u2019t\nknow. That\u2019s what I think will happen.",
        "Q: Is that something you worry about, or --",
        "A: Yes, I think it\u2019s very important it should be remembered, and I do worry about that,\nbut I -- 1t\u2019s beyond me, you know? Once we gone, we gone, there\u2019s nothing we can do\nabout it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, it see -- Just seems that in my own lifetime, that -- you know, I\nwas born in the early 50\u2019s.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And it seems to me that it\u2019s really been in the last, say 20 years or so, there has been\nmuch more talk, much more sort of public stuff, more movies.",
        "A: That\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Things like the Holocaust Museum being established, and all that it --",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: -- that actually -- you know, as a kid, I learned about it in history class.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And actually, you know, I was raised Catholic, but we discussed it in religion class.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But other than that, you know, just in the general culture --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I would say until ab -- you know, roughly about 20 years ago, there wasn\u2019t a\ntremendous amount about it, and then --",
        "A: That\u2019s true. That it very true. I-I tell you why, because the initiative has no -- had not\nbeen taken by Jewish leaders here. We, the survivors alone tried to organize these things.\nYou see, the survivors themself, organize the Yom HaShoah day. It wasn\u2019t national like it\nwas now, but I remember from early days on, we used to go to Milwaukee, and all -- all\nof us survivors get together somewhere, and observe Yom HaShoah day, but later on,\nwhen it got to be more popular, then local officials joined, and it got to be on -- ona\nwider scale, and this is the way it happened. But we, the survivors, started that ourselves.\nOf course, we didn\u2019t have all this power to get it on such a large scale. The Holocaust\nMuseum did a lot to -- too, you know, to make this happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So really, it was the survivors here that --",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm. Locally here, we hardly did anything, if we the few survivors didn\u2019t\ntake the initiative to do something, but now, for two years, they are having like ca --\nsending out letters to the schools here, and they should write a theme on why the\nHolocaust should be remembered, and they reward them with prizes, and a get together,\nand a little ceremony. But this is only the second year that they\u2019ve been doing it here\nlocally. Otherwise it never had been done.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My husband and I always used to go to Milwaukee.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s about it for my questions. Again, before --",
        "A: That\u2019s fine.",
        "Q: -- we go, anything else you want to bring up or mention?",
        "A: I -- \u2019ma blank right now.",
        "Q: Well, I -- I will just say again for the record, that you did two long interviews, video\ninterviews --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- with the museum, those are in the record there --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- about -- you know, in -- in -- in great detail --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- your -- your experiences actually during the war. We\u2019ve talked about mostly\ndifferent things here today.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But anyone who\u2019s curious about any of that, the tapes are on file, and they can go back\nand listen, it\u2019s --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- some amazing, fascinating things on it.",

        "Q: Oh sure, of course.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, let me just -- let me just end our tape. So anyway, if --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- if there\u2019s nothing more to add, then I\u2019ll just thank you for taking the time to talk to\nUS.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s very nice of you to come and take your time, and I\u2019m glad\nyou came, and we had this nice talk.",
        "Q: Well, I always knew there would be some reason I would go to Sheboygan,\nWisconsin. You turned out to be it, so --",
        "A: Oh, thank you.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll turn off the machinery, we\u2019ll let you actually open up your door,\nand put on the air conditioner, and do all that stuff that makes noise, and --",
        "A: That\u2019s fine, no problem.",

        "Q: -- pretty complete. So -- But what we want to do today is talk about what\u2019s been\nhappening to you since the war. And I\u2019m just trying to think of a good place to pick up.\nYou\u2019ve told the story of the day of liberation --",
        "Q: -- and you were in Bergen-Belsen --",
        "Q: -- concentration camp. And, you know, one question I had, which you didn\u2019t talk\nabout specifically in these interviews, 1s the final days of the war, the conditions in the\ncamp were just deplorable. And you and your sister --",
        "Q: -- and two friends --",
        "Q: -- were keeping yourselves alive with one potato.",
        "Q: On the -- On the -- the actual day of liberation, as you talked about in your video\ninterviews, you had actually, I guess, gone into the barracks, and y-you --",

        "Q: Did you think it was some sort of dream?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The -- The question I had about all this, because you have talked about this in -- at\nsome length in your other interviews, is if the British hadn\u2019t come right then, if an allied -",
        "Q: -- military force had not arrived somewhere in that period --",
        "Q: -- to liberate the camp, do you have any notion how much longer you might have\nlived?",

        "Q: Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was\ngoing, and -- and how long you thought it would be before it ended, before it was over?",
        "Q: So things like what was happening in Hamburg with the bombings, and the --",

        "Q: -- to just staying alive.",

        "Q: What -- If we could talk about what happened after liberation. You didn\u2019t leave, as I\nunderstand it, you didn\u2019t leave Bergen-Belsen immediately --",

        "Q: What -- So once you were mar -- what year did you get married in?",
        "Q: What month, do you remember?",
        "Q: So May of \u201946, so about a year after the war ended.",
        "Q: And then once you were married, how long did it take you to figure out what to do\nnext? What -- What discussions did you have about where you might go, and where you\nmight pick up your life?",

        "Q: -- because so many people had --",
        "Q: Right. I understand that, I\u2019m just curious what those thoughts were. What was your\nthinking abo -- on that subject?",
        "Q: You said that when you had your children, especially your first one, 1t was very\ndifficult --",
        "Q: -- you were very sick. I\u2019m wondering what -- I mean, it\u2019s always an incredibly\nemotional time when, you know, someone has a child.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering if there were a whole extra set of emotions because this was right after\nthe Holocaust.",
        "Q: So many Jews were dead.",
        "Q: And if there were a lot of extra emotions, is -- can you describe what those were?",
        "Q: Did you see having children somehow, as you know, being a small part in, sort of, so\nmany Jews had been taken from the earth, and sort of helping to bring them back?",

        "Q: And it sounds like it might have been kind of strained.",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s -- let\u2019s pick up this story again, where you\u2019re -- you\u2019re trying to get to\nUnited States, so you go through the application process --",

        "Q: What month and year was this?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you came into the harbor, and --",
        "Q: As someone who originally comes from New Jersey, I\u2019d have to say I think you\u2019re\nbetter off that you went to Wisconsin, but -- nobody from New Jersey wants to --",

        "Q: Why do you think that happened, was it just sort of accidental?",
        "Q: Hm. I have a note here, this is from the museum that I -- I guess maybe you mentioned\nthis in wa -- one of your other interviews that you had, most of your friends here were not\nJewish, and it says that you said you think that\u2019s the way it should be, and they want to\nknow what do you mean by that?",
        "Q: Do you remember that? Saying that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: With your friends, your non-Jewish friends --",
        "Q: -- during this period, did they ask you much about what happened to you during the\nwar, did you talk about it much?",

        "Q: -- I\u2019m also curious how they react. Have -- Have they heard much of this before, or --\nor are they sort of in the dark about this to start with?",
        "Q: When you talk to them about what happened, do they seem very shocked? Do -- Do\nthey ever have trouble believing that this type of thing actually happens, or --",
        "Q: So do some of the students actually say to you, I did have doubts that the Holocaust\nhappened, or --",
        "Q: How does it come up? Do they say that they looked into it and wondered if it\nhappened, or -- I\u2019m just curious where this sort of line of thought comes from.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s go back to sort of your -- your family history again.",

        "Q: Around what age did you start talking about?",
        "Q: As the years went on, and they got older, did they continue to be curious about it, did\nthey ask you to tell them?",

        "Q: Do you still have dreams today, about --",
        "Q: Do you think that -- obviously, you know, in many ways it\u2019s a good experience, do\nyou think that it\u2019s been a good thing that you\u2019ve become a bit of a public speaker about\nthe Holocaust? Has that helped you in any way, sort of sort things out, or deal with it?",
        "Q: Do you read much about the Holocaust, and what about films, and documentaries, and\nthat sort of thing?",
        "Q: Do you -- Do you feel that what you lived through, and what you saw, had any great\naffect on how -- you know, it\u2019s a big question, I guess, maybe it\u2019s too big, but how you\nsee the world, or -- or how you see other human beings, or just humanity in general. Do\nyou think that you saw things one way before the war, and it was drastically different\nafterward, or what -- what\u2019s that been like for you?",

        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019m curious what your reaction is. You know, we\u2019re doing this interview, right\nnow there is a supposed peace plan in Kosovo, but for the last, you know, few months\nespecially --",
        "Q: The Albanians were driven out of Kosovo --",
        "Q: -- and there have been a lot of references back to what happened in World War Two,\nby commentators, and politicians, or whatever. And when things like this happen in the\nworld, or especially a story like that, in -- in -- in Europe, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019ve been\nfeeling while this has been in the news, and what your reaction has been.",
        "Q: What about the argument that some people have made that of course this isn\u2019t like the\nHolocaust, but if countries had acted when whole populations were being persecuted in\nthe past, then a lot could have be-been avoided. And this whole notion that now, you\nknow, something should be done, and it shouldn\u2019t be permitted, do you -- what about that\nargument?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Does -- Were you very -- Before the war, were you and your family very\nreligious?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And, are you still, or --",
        "Q: One thing I wonder about it, you know, given what you went through during the war,\nwhat you saw happen, what you experienced first-hand, did that -- how did that affect, or\ndid it affect your notion of God?",
        "Q: And then, what\u2019s happened since then? Do you still feel the same way\u201d?",
        "Q: So, do you feel like you stopped being angry at God?",
        "Q: But there\u2019s no great answer. I mean, I guess what I\u2019m wondering, do you think, in\nwhat happened, was there some meaning 1n this, or it was just this incredible outburst of\nevil, and it doesn\u2019t mean anything, or --",
        "Q: Just to go back during, you know, all the years you -- you lived here, and you\u2019re\nraising a family, --",
        "Q: -- and you know, solid citizen of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and all that, any other -- any\nstories that you want to tell, or any incidents, or things you remember, or -- or stuff you\nfelt at the time that somehow hasn\u2019t come up in our conversation, that you think is worth\nmentioning?",
        "Q: Anything.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I think in one of your video interviews, you mentioned that before you came\nhere -- they have a little quote here, that you said that you had heard wonderful things\nabout the United States.",
        "Q: And we\u2019d like to know, what had you heard?",
        "Q: So, partly because of what she had --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then, when -- in the first few years you were here, do you think that the\nUnited States lived up to the advance billing, or not?",
        "Q: What\u2019s the cat\u2019s name?",
        "Q: She had something -- She -- She -- She wants to add something to the conversation, I\nthink.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. Well, I think we\u2019ll be done in a -- in a minute or two.",
        "Q: I think we\u2019ll be done in a minute or two.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, he\u2019s checking out my tape recorder. So, you say you have dreams where\nyou\u2019re actually -- you\u2019re showing things to your mother?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, when you came here, you loved it, there were all these amazing sort of\nmaterial things.",
        "Q: But was there -- was there anything you missed, is there stuff that -- or some aspect of\nlife that -- that you had in Europe, that you feel is -- doesn\u2019t exist so much here, or\nanything like that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Is there anything else that we haven\u2019t talked about, that you\u2019d like to talk\nabout?",
        "Q: You know, it -- it has been so many years, and the people who did the live through it,\nwho are still alive, obviously are not going to be around forever.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier when we were talking, that you\u2019ve always still -- and your\nchildren used to try to reassure you about it, been a little apprehensive about what could\nhappen, what --",
        "Q: -- you know, somehow something similar happening -- happening in the future. I\u2019m\nwondering if -- what your feelings are also about once all the people who actually lived\nthrough this --",
        "Q: -- are gone, and whether the memory will persist, or will it be forgotten?",
        "Q: Is that something you worry about, or --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, it see -- Just seems that in my own lifetime, that -- you know, I\nwas born in the early 50\u2019s.",
        "Q: And it seems to me that it\u2019s really been in the last, say 20 years or so, there has been\nmuch more talk, much more sort of public stuff, more movies.",
        "Q: Things like the Holocaust Museum being established, and all that it --",
        "Q: -- that actually -- you know, as a kid, I learned about it in history class.",
        "Q: And actually, you know, I was raised Catholic, but we discussed it in religion class.",
        "Q: But other than that, you know, just in the general culture --",
        "Q: I would say until ab -- you know, roughly about 20 years ago, there wasn\u2019t a\ntremendous amount about it, and then --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So really, it was the survivors here that --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s about it for my questions. Again, before --",
        "Q: -- we go, anything else you want to bring up or mention?",
        "Q: Well, I -- I will just say again for the record, that you did two long interviews, video\ninterviews --",
        "Q: -- with the museum, those are in the record there --",
        "Q: -- about -- you know, in -- in -- in great detail --",
        "Q: -- your -- your experiences actually during the war. We\u2019ve talked about mostly\ndifferent things here today.",
        "Q: But anyone who\u2019s curious about any of that, the tapes are on file, and they can go back\nand listen, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- some amazing, fascinating things on it.",
        "Q: Oh sure, of course.",
        "Q: Well, let me just -- let me just end our tape. So anyway, if --",
        "Q: -- if there\u2019s nothing more to add, then I\u2019ll just thank you for taking the time to talk to\nUS.",
        "Q: Well, I always knew there would be some reason I would go to Sheboygan,\nWisconsin. You turned out to be it, so --",
        "Q: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll turn off the machinery, we\u2019ll let you actually open up your door,\nand put on the air conditioner, and do all that stuff that makes noise, and --",

        "A: Yes, but we also came -- we came to Bergen-Belsen, having a li -- a portion of bread\nfrom Hamburg, from a -- from a so-called labor camp. But this labor camp was a sub-\ncamp of Neuengamme. And it -- Neuengamme was an extermination camp, everybody\nknows that, but somehow we got transported to Bergen-Belsen, with this piece of bread\nyet. So we ate first this bread, and then this potato, but it was just impossible to -- you\nknow, we were losing our strength, and could barely walk. So, it is true that we stayed\nalive with one potato, I don\u2019t know by what miracle we did stay alive, but like I said, to\nthe end, we couldn\u2019t walk any more. Went in in the barrack to lay down, and to die. This\nis when liberation came. I was really also sick with typhoid fever, but I had sort of the\nwalking around typhoid fever. I wasn\u2019t that severe, my sister was. She had to be taken\naway to a hospital, and she was very, very ill. When -- When she got well, I could hardly\nrecognize her. She looked worse than the people that were dead in the camp. But\nsomehow, you see, we survived, and we didn\u2019t find anyone of our family. It was very\nheartbreaking, and at this point it seems pointless to live. There was nothing to go on for.",
        "A: Gave up.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, we did. And one of my friends, she -- she wanted to -- to just walk out, and\nsort of a last farewell look at the camp, and came back and told us that was funny things\ngoing on out there. I just said, \u201cForget it. You hallucinating,\u201d you know. \u201cLet me die in\npeace.\u201d She kept on nudging, and my sister went out. I don\u2019t know where my sister got\nthe strength to come back and grab me by my arm, and tell me, \u201cGet up, you have to see\nwhat -- what is out there.\u201d It was unbelievable. I just didn\u2019t think I was alive. No, it was\nimpossible. I thought I died.",
        "A: Yes, sort of like I was watching, you know, this isn\u2019t really happening to me. I don\u2019t\nknow. But it was real enough, and we were liberated by the English army. It was\nheartbreaking though, that so many people, those living pe -- skeletons that couldn\u2019t walk\nany more, you know, getting bread, and couldn\u2019t make use of it any more, because that\ntoo late for them.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Maybe a day or two. Because maybe I wouldn\u2019t be starved to that point of dying, but I\ncompletely gave up, because I thought there was no other way. There\u2019s nothing left.\nSooner or later, we all will be dead. This is the end of it. So, just giving up on everything.\nNo food, no water, nothing. Nowhere to turn. There -- There -- Outside the barbed wire,\nthere was kohlrabi -- I probably mentioned that too, the piles kohlrabi that were\ndecomposed, that people there still risking their lives to get one of those squash things, a\nsmelly things to eat.",
        "A: It\u2019s like -- What can I say? It\u2019s a thing that you used to feed animals. And I know it\nwas -- in Europe it\u2019s called kohlrabi, I don\u2019t know how to translate this into English, up\nto this day, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s supposed to have been the people\u2019s food. It was\nwarm in April, you know. The sun was beating down on that. The kohlrabi was\ndecomposed. People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were\nshot. They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so\ndesperate to get this. But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. I was a\nvery timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. If it\nwouldn\u2019t be for her, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be alive, because she worked in a different place,\nwhere she had more access to food. And she always used to smuggle into the camp, some\nof it for me, which was a great help.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Because I could see that there was no hel -- no help coming from nowhere. Nothing.\nWhere do we go? Surrounded by barbed wire and dead corpses. And you walked around,\nand -- and people were just dying right in front of you. What was waiting for us? The\nsame thing, you know? So it\u2019s just -- you might as well, sooner or later, because there\u2019s\nno other way.",
        "A: Oh yes, we know that. We know they were losing the war, especially when I was in\nHamburg, then we were still working there on the streets, you know? Th-The fliers, the\nAllied fliers, they were coming three, four, five times a day, and we worked there. Like it\nsays in my interview, next to a radar station, we could hear that radar turning and\nbeeping, and the sirens going on. They were here. We could -- We could hear the bombs\nflying, and everything. And the city of Hamburg was one rubble on top of the other.\nThat\u2019s the way it looked. So we knew no -- no country in condition -- in condition like\nthat could win a war. It was impossible for them. But the question was, are we -- are we -\n- will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this? That was the question.",
        "A: We really did not. It -- We were so absorbed in trying, first to survive from day to day.\nWe did not see a tomorrow. That\u2019s what it was, just trying to survive every day as it\ncame.",

I\nhonestly don\u2019t know. People say, oh, you were destined. God was watching over you,\nthat you should survive and be able to tell that story. I really don\u2019t know what forces kept\nus alive. It\u2019s just impossible to tell.",

        "A: How she found it, I don\u2019t know. I say it was a miracle.",
        "A: Yes, it did, but it seems like we were always the ones that had this willpower. When\nwe went to work, we got our portion of bread in the morning, some people ate it right\naway, they were so hungry. We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my\nfriends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have\nthe reassurance that I have something to eat for later. We knew nothing else was coming.\nSt -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one\ntime -- you worked for a couple weeks in a village across the Elba. The village was called\nKronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat. But that was also -- you had to be lucky to\nbe picked for this. You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the\nvillage, because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so 1t was\na great big fight in the morning to get first in line, to be picked for this place. We were\nalways divided in different working groups. Most of the time, a majority of the time, I\nwas in Hamburg, cleaning the streets.",
        "A: Tho-Those were not German guards any more.",
        "A: Those were -- They\u2019re volunteer militias from the Ukraine, Lithuane, and Hungary,\nand they -- they had white armbands, we could see that. And those people were still\nshooting at us, when the people tried to get those kohlrabi, you know? I can\u2019t understand\ntheir logic, and their way of thinking.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Chaos. It was nothing. Not where we were. You see, Bergen-Belsen, were like several\ncamps together, divided. That much I know, because if -- we were with others, but not --\nI didn\u2019t even know that children survived there, in certain places. We di -- We didn\u2019t\nknow that, because we were not together with these people.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I-It -- Things were happening, and they didn\u2019t have to do anything. People were just\ndying, because they didn\u2019t feed -- s -- the people that were there previously, they\nprobably weren\u2019t fed for the longest time already. So, that was just like -- they were self-\ndestructing, they didn\u2019t have to do anything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not -- Well, we -- they ge -- they handed out food. This is all I ru -- I remember, being\nclose in contact. I also watched them later, right away film that liberation. They were\nputting it on film. And I know there is a video of it, 1t\u2019s called liberation of Bergen-\nBelsen. This is exactly what they did, right away. And next thing I know, when we were\nsort of already settled, and they came in -- I don\u2019t know, they must have been Scotchmen,\nor whatever, they came in with their bagpipes and skirts, you know. And I was sitting on\n-- on the curb, and I looked up, and that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a man dressed like that,\nin a skirt, and I just laughed so hard, I could hardly catch my breath, cause I didn -- never\nsaw anything like it.",
        "A: We were just overwhelmed, and then my sister started feeling very sick, and we tried\nto get her in the hospital, but there was no hospitals there, there were just makeshift\nbuildings, mattresses on the floors, and the people were laying just covered up with\nsheets. Not enough doctors, and do you know, the German population from around, they\nwere forced to come into the camp and see all this. And the English needed help with the\nsick people, those nurses, the local nurses didn't even want to come in, they had to be\nbrought in at gunpoint. They didn\u2019t want to come and help the sick people. It took me a\nlong time to find my sister in those buildings. I didn\u2019t know where they took her. Finally\nI found her, and there she was on the floor laying and holding a -- a rag with cold water\nto her head, and she said, last night the doctor said to her -- he looked at her, and he said,\n\u201cThis woman has the crisis tonight. If she\u2019s al -- If she survives, she\u2019Il be alive tomorrow\nmorning.\u201d She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep a whole night, I wanted to die with my eyes open.\u201d\nHere I come in the morning, and thank God she was alive. Then they first started giving\nher medication. Medication was so scarce that they only gave it to people they thought\nwould survive. That was the case of it.",

My\nfather\u2019s name was Israel. I had two more brothers. One of them was called in Yiddish,\nSmaul Hirsch, and the other one, Yankel David. And we all came from the Lodz ghetto\ninto Auschwitz, and this is what happened to them, they never got out of there.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: No, we -- we all went with the transport from the ghetto, together we went to\nAuschwitz, but they never got out of there. They were -- My mother was with us when\nthey were selecting the people, they just took her right to the left side. And my two\nbrothers and my father, we didn\u2019t know for sure, but then we met a gentleman that was in\nthe ghetto, a neighbor, and he was behind them in line, and he told us that they went the\nwrong way, so there was no way we could find anybody any more.",

But the brother died several\nyears ago in New Jersey, he had cancer, and he died. His sister, I think, is still alive in\nJerusalem. I haven\u2019t heard from her for a long time.

And\nfrom my father\u2019s side, none of them survived, there was no sign of them. My\ngrandparents -- My grandma -- My grandma was taken away, my mother\u2019s mother, huh.\nShe was really an old lady. It-It\u2019s hard to talk about it.",
        "A: Not much, no. Mm-mm. She was asked several times by the generation after in -- in\nMilwaukee that organizes the survivors to speak in schools. She went a couple times, but\nshe doesn\u2019t care to do that, no. My husband wouldn\u2019t do that, either.",
        "A: Well, yes --",
        "A: -- we reminiscent -- reminiscent. I have one of my friends that we were together. She\nlives in New Jersey. The other one died, also several years of cancer. Otherwise, when I\nwent -- you see, my two daughters, I have two daughters, they live in New York City,\nand when we used to go and visit in New York City, I used to get together with them,\nbecause it\u2019s like family, you know, we were always together. One of them had died\nseveral years ago, she was sick. But this one is alive, and we are always in touch. As a\nmatter of fact, we just talked on the phone about a week ago, and we always reminiscent\nabout the old times, where we were. They were also in the Lodz ghetto. From different\nplaces, you know, he took people from all over Poland, dragging them into the -- certain\nghettos from here and there, confusing us completely. And she was from a little town\nsomewhere, but she spent time in the ghetto, and from there, also came to Auschwitz, so\nwe have been in the same camp, afterwards. And liberated together, so we are always in\ntouch.",
        "A: Home. How it was before the war. About my father, my -- my brothers, what we all\ndid. My mother, my grandmother. My grandmother had a little grocery store. In Europe\nit\u2019s entirely different. It\u2019s not like here, you know. I -- I don\u2019t know how to describe, but\neverything was in canvas sacks, you know. You had a scale, and bags, and people came,\nand said, \u201cGive me a half a pound.\u201d So you took -- took a bag out, and took it out of the\nsack, and weigh it, and just give it to the people. But they got to get on in age, and th -- it\nwas hard for them. You d -- had no people working for you, if you wanted to make a\nliving, you had to do everything yourself. So they sold that little grocery store, and both\ncame to live with us, grandpa and grandma. Grandpa died right before the war, about two\nor three years before the war, and grandma un -- when they came to live with us, she sort\nof took over the kitchen. She was used to always being busy, and my mom was very\ndistressed about it, because my father\u2019s workshop was sort of divided between the\nkitchen and his workshop. So she used to say, \u201cMom, what are you doing? People come\nup and they think I made a maid out of you.\u201d And she used to say, \u201cWhat am I supposed\nto do, sit down and die? Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d So my mom used to say, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you\nlet at least the girls help you with the dishes?\u201d She said, \u201cOch, let them go and play.\nWhen they get married, they\u2019Il do plenty dishes.\u201d So that was, you know? And then in\nwintry nights, we used to sit around in the evening, my grandpa used to tell stories about\nsages, and learned man, all these cert -- also certain fables, or we used to play -- of all the\nthings we used to play in winter, Bingo, or cards we used to play, with the children, it\nwas like a game. The s -- And neighbors used to come up, and have like a neighborhood\nklatch, you know? It was always -- our house was always full of company. People used to\ncome, and even during the war, when they occupied, and we were still in our own\napartment, my father was forced to -- to work for the Germans because he was about the\nonly craftsman in our little place, and you had to do what they told you, you know,\notherwise they shoot -- they come -- they come, my father had to repair their watches.\nThey -- They brought gold pieces that they robbed all these big farm -- rich farms. My\nfather had to melt them down and make bracelets, and rings, and whatnot, all that they\nsend into Germany. And so we had -- we had to work for them. A lot of them were real\nbad, but there were -- there was a single one among them that would bring some bread, or\nwhatever, which was very helpful in those times. But still, the neighbors -- and there was\na lot of people that had no food any more, and whatever we had, people used to come up,\nand we had a big bench, and a table on the side, whatever we cooked, we always used to\nshare with everybody. I-It\u2019s not something that I\u2019m trying to tell you because I won\u2019t get\na medal for it, but that\u2019s the way it was in our house, we used to share everything we had.",
        "A: Yes, yes, a lot of times. Well, talking about the war brings a lot of bad memories, and\na lot of heartache. Most of the time we try to avoid it, unless there\u2019s something specific\nthat comes up.",
        "A: Oh, probably. Anniversary of liberation, or when we go to, in spring, you know, when\nthey -- Yom HaShoah day comes, or whatever. So it\u2019s just -- certain things come back,\nand reminisce -- then we reminisce in the -- those times. Remember when this happened,\nand we almost dead. Like I got blood poisoning working on -- on a -- they call it\nbowshtella, we had to dig ditches for foundations for the peop -- for homes for the people\nthat were bombed out in Hamburg, when I was working on that place -- assigned to that\njob, and I hit a rusty nail, and I got blood poisoning in my hand, in my whole hand here.\nWe had an infirmary, I went to this, there was a Czech woman, also prisoner. She just\ndigged around and digged around and -- with nothing, and couldn\u2019t find anything. At that\ntime we had an Obersharfuthrer who was crazy about us being healthy. He didn\u2019t care\nabout food or anything, just healthy. So at that time, three of us were sick, so he took the\nthree of us, with a German SS woman, and there was one of -- always picked the altesta\nfrom our own people, and they took us into the city. Well, that camp was in Zazell, and\nthey took us into the city of Hamburg. I -- The only thing I know, that we went into a\nprisoner of war camp. I don\u2019t know to this day if it was French or Czech, or -- or Italian,\nor Czech, or whatever it was, I have no idea, because I couldn\u2019t recognize the language.\nAnd this doctor, when my -- they had a doctor there, also prisoner. When my turn came,\nhe looked at my finger, and he pointed, and then he pointed at the plain wooden table,\npointed that I should lay down. Stretched out myself, and he poured from a bottle ether\non my face -- just plain ether. I was choking, bells were ringing in my ears, and I thought\nI was dead. This is it, I\u2019m dying, I gave up. But when I woke up, I was sitting already,\nand my finger was bandaged. And afterwards, they changed my bandages in camp, then I\ncould see what it looked like, my finger was like separated in half. My whole nail was\ngone, and there was a piece, they cut off there a piece. But I healed ver -- very, very\nslowly. I had to go to work with all that. So, we had ups and downs in the camp, you\nknow? There were some that cared, again, for food, but didn\u2019t care for our welfare. These\n-- They called them the Obersharfihrer, that the camp, tha -- from the SS that\nadministered the camp, and we had a few that were real vicious, too. We had SS women\nalso, and they were even worse than the men.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, you had to re-gain your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her\nbrothers, they came to take her back to the American zone, they did talk us into going\nwith them, thinking, oh maybe you still will find someone, you know? We did go. Of\ncourse, we had no money, no we traveled how we traveled.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, you had to re-gain your strength a little bit, and because my friend found her\nbrothers, they came to take her back to the American zone, they did talk us into going\nwith them, thinking, oh maybe you still will find someone, you know? We did go. Of\ncourse, we had no money, no, we traveled how we traveled.",
        "A: Two friends.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Sure. The one that died is -- her name was Doba Finkelstein. The other one was --\nname was Genia Stolsoft, and Genia came from a small place called Kovol, but Doba was\na girl from Lodz, that much I know. She\u2019s the one that died. And it was funny with her,\nbecause she was looking for a brother, or her cousin, and she found a man with the same\nlast name as hers, thinking it\u2019s a -- a relative, and to the end she married him, he wasn\u2019t a\nrelative. She didn\u2019t even have to change her last name.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: We -- We met them while we were in Auschwitz standing 1n line, we were supposed\nto be forming lines of five, and we were sort of paired off with them, and from then on\nwe kept on being together, until -- until we were going to the same camp, and by accident\nbeing put in the same barrack. Then we went to Zazell for work. So just all this -- did\neverything together, just supporting, looking out for one another.",
        "A: You mean, after I went to ber -- to Feldifing?",
        "A: Yes, we did travel with them. I don\u2019t know if it says there, on coal wagons, on freight\ntrains we traveled, because we didn\u2019t have any money, who get -- who gets money? Just\nthey gave us some clothing, and food, of course, the English. We did arrive in Feldifing,\nit was -- the condition -- the conditions were much better there. I can\u2019t say anything\nagainst the English except that the warmth wasn\u2019t forthcoming. They -- A little\ncompassion was less available for us. In the beginning they were shocked, you know, and\nvery much overcome. But later on it seems like, you know -- but on the American zone,\nthere was more the warmth of it. It was like -- you felt more that somebody cares.",
        "A: They were more generous if you asked for something, or -- you could see the way they\nwere interested, that there was more compassion forthcoming from them, where over\nthere, it was like, very impersonal. That\u2019s what it was. Th-They used -- the Americans\nMP\u2019s used to come in into this place -- camp, because Feldifing had formed -- they told\nthem to form their own police force, and administration, [indecipherable] infirmary, and\nall. A -- There was a vocational school there. So the MP\u2019s used to come in with certain\ninformation, and they were very friendly towards everybody. It was -- It was really nice.",
        "A: In Feldifing? We came here in 1951. Actually, we started out in 1949, and never got --\nfirst we ended up in Bremerhaven, at that time -- and by that time, I had a little baby.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re asking me -- yeah --",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t move, we -- we lived til 1949, in Feldifing. The reason we stayed there\nthat long was because we didn\u2019t want to go to Poland, and we didn\u2019t want to stay in\nGermany, and we had no relatives any place, so we couldn\u2019t go until organization started\nto sponsor survivors. Then we registered, okay? My sister came right away, and when I\nregistered, and was ready to go, okay, we all ended up in Bremerhaven, but when it was\ntime to go on the boat, my baby got sick. So they don\u2019t let you on the boat with sick\nchildren, and because so many people were -- there was a camp in Bremerhaven -- now I\nforgot already where this place was called, but we stayed there. I\u2019Il have to remember.\nThinking. So, anyway, so many people together, and a lot of them had babies already,\nand a lot of children were sick with all these diseases that children get. And my child\nhappened to get every disease that were possible to be there. I never could go on a boat.\nEvery time I had to go on a boat, she was sick, you know? By the time I was able to, and\nthen my visa run out, my luck was, that up to this point, the visas were renewed\nautomatically. When my turn came, they said they don\u2019t do that any more, you have to go\nback to the point where we came from, and this is why we ended up again being in\nFeldifing, going back to the whole rigamarong again, all over. So --",
        "A: In Feldifing. Because we were also just walking around, looking for a relative, or a\nfriend, and we didn\u2019t find anyone. We didn\u2019t find anyone, and he was also -- he was from\na family of six children, he was the only one. So everyone looked for -- not finding a\nrelative, everybody looked for companionship, for someone to lean on. It wasn\u2019t a\nstorybook romances, it was people needing one another, that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: My husband\u2019s name is Antrul, and he comes from Lodz, he is originally from Lodz,\nyes.",
        "A: Well, just meeting, just saying hi, where are you from? You know? And we lived in\nFeldifing, in a little room, it was down -- actually, it was called the basement. There were\nbunkbeds, and the four of us lived there. We were still together. So, my friend that was\nlooking for Finkelstein, he used to come down there, and he used to bring some friends\nalong, and this is where we met, there were also, like places -- you know, the Americans\norganized dance halls, they wanted people to have some fun. They also brought movies\ninto the camp, and we had traveling survivor\u2019s orchestras giving concerts. So there was\nlike getting -- public getting together, and where are you from, asking where are you\nfrom, who are you, and this is the way people met.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t very long. Maybe several months. There were no long courtships at that\ntime.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, first we registered with the shtandersump in Germany, in -- in th-this little place\ncalled Shtarenberg, and then we just had a religious ceren -- ceremony in a Hasidic\nrabbi\u2019s study. We couldn\u2019t afford anything, we had no money. We had witnesses, I have\na ketuba, a religious one. I went according to -- I would be accepted in Israel now,\nbecause I went to all these ceremonies that were asked of me.",
        "A: Well, that didn\u2019t work that way, because there wasn\u2019t enough room in the camps. It\nwas like one big room, and somehow, they gave us some boards, and divide it into a wall,\nand on the other side another couple lived, and on this side, we lived. And this is the way\nit worked. You could hear every sneeze, and ya -- every word that was going on, but\nthere was no other way, until we could figure out where we wanted to go.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: 46.",
        "A: May.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t, because we didn\u2019t, but my husband went and enlisted with this police force\nthere, the displaced camp police force. And I went and registered into the vocational\nschool, and I took a course in sewing. So, for the time being, me and my other friend, the\none that died, we both took the course in sewing, and we both took on, later on,\nalterations for other people, for which we got -- used to get fruit, or money, or whatever,\nyou know, to have something. And my husband, after awhile they used to get some\nGerman marks from the German government, like from the state where we were,\nBavarian state, they used to get some German marks, because they sort of were on a\npilung of a police department, or whatever they called it, after awhile. And in the\nbeginning, there was no -- no talk of anything, because we still tried to figure out where\nare we, what do we supposed to be doing? Then later on, of course no one wanted to stay.\nPeople had relatives overseas, they sent papers for them, and this is what made us think\nwhat are -- what is going to be our future? What are we going to do? We did -- We didn\u2019t\nsee any way out. Finally, this came. It was just like a -- winning a lottery when we were\ntold we could register to the united -- to go to the United States, or Canada, or Australia. I\nreally thought that wasn\u2019t true. I di -- I didn\u2019t -- I always was the pessimist.",
        "A: Ah, well. But I really was, in the beginning. My sister, she was always the first one.\nThat\u2019s why, she registered first, and she -- she just came first, right away. Even if I would\nhave left in 1949, she left before me, yeah.",
        "A: We did in the beginning, but I don\u2019t think I would have been very good material,\nbecause I wasn\u2019t a strong person. I wanted to have a child, because everybody got killed,\nokay? So, after my daughter was born, I was three and a half months in the hospital. I\nwas the one that they thought would never survive. I was deadly sick after she was born.\nAnd so, when I finally recovered, the doctor said to me, \u201cNo more children, cause you\ndidn\u2019t recover like other people.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I could s -- take the illegal journey, first it\nwas Palestine, that I could take that. And now, finally that I got my life together, I wanted\nto live for something. And then I thought, let\u2019s go first to the United States, where I can\ntake a deep breath, relax, and maybe recover my strength. I can always go to Israel. But\nyou know, once you are settled somewhere, and your children are here, it\u2019s very hard to\npick up and go again.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: My older daughter was born in 1949, my younger daughter in 1955.",
        "A: My older daughter\u2019s name is Marta, and my younger daughter\u2019s name 1s Sally.",
        "A: Well, I still would want children, regardless. I would have had more, not only two, but\nI -- I even th -- with the second one, it was very hard here in the United States, and I just -\n- I didn\u2019t think I would be able to do that. So, had to settle for that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s true, too. That 1s true, too. But under normal circumstances, I would have want\nchildren anyway.",
        "A: Well, Jewish thinking 1s always, you have to have a namesake, you have to have\nsomeone to remember. And children are always named after departed ones. So that\u2019s --\nMy oldest daughter\u2019s name, Marta\u2019s actually Matel, it\u2019s after my mother. And my Sally is\nafter my grandmother.",
        "A: Very.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They ver -- very sort of anxious emotions, because she was also sickly child, because I\nwas not in perfect health, and I always watched her and carried her to the doctor, and I\nput her -- I didn\u2019t have a bed, she slept in her buggy, or whatever. And I sat -- half the\nnights, I used to sit by that buggy and watch her, and when she moved her fingers, or\nmoved her head, I considered, oh what a miracle, this is mine, you know, my own, no one\ncan ever take this away from me. And it was -- most of the time when I looked at her, I\ncried. It was a miracle to me.",
        "A: Maybe, in a way, I would say that the Jewish people do not disappear completely, and\nwell, just for myself, I wanted, as a parent, to have a child. And it was, for me, to love\nand to have, and we always had good -- a good relationship with our children, and still\ndo.",
        "A: Yes. So, we registered, and like I said, we were in Bremerhaven, and we had to go\nback. We had to go ba -- go -- go to the same commission. We had to go and have chest\nx-rays, and all that stuff done again, and we had to travel from Feldifing into Munich, and\na place called the Funkazerner. Now, Funkazer-kazerner means soldier\u2019s place, you\nknow, where soldiers must have been housed at one time or another. This 1s where they\nhad their -- all the in -- and we had to go -- would you believe, we all had to go through a\nvery true screening. They had to make sure that we were who we were, and we were in\nthe concentration camps. Somehow they couldn\u2019t find my husband\u2019s background, so he\nhad to travel in Germany, to this place called Arelson, and bring the papers from there, ca\n-- so they ma -- make sure that he is who he 1s. It was so ironical, now that I think of it,\nhow many Nazis went through, that had no problems at all, and us, the survivors, they\nmade so many problems, trying to -- and one time, the second time when we went for a\nhearing before the INS, they were called, he asked me where I worked, you know? I said,\nin ha -- all the questions where I di -- wa -- the most work. I said, \u201cIn Hamburg.\u201d\n\u2018\u201cWhereabouts in Hamburg?\u201d See? And when I told him, he says, \u201cOh, yeah, I know the\nplace, I was there.\u201d He tried to catch me, if I\u2019m saying something wrong. That really hurt.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And my husband was held back quite a few times, because he was a\npoliceman in the displaced camp, and at that time, the sentiment against the Communists\nwere very strong, and there was organiz -- Jewish organization called the Bundt, which\nwas more left, you know. And they had -- in May they had a May day parade, and\nbecause he has a -- was a policeman, they assumed he knows who these people were, and\nhe should give them names of those Bundists. My husband said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody.\u201d\nHe came home and told me that, after he was through. I said, \u201cEven if you knew, you\nshouldn\u2019t give them any names, because who wants to have a person that squeals, one on\nanother. He didn\u2019t know. You know, they had 24 hour duty. After he came home from\nduty, he slept most of the time, because he was tired. He was not in any social integration\nthere, no one was. We always tried to see where we -- what we wanted to do. So, he had\nno political interest, neither did I at that time. Of course, our sympathies were -- were\nwith Israel, at that time Palestine, but none of us were inclined to be Communist, or left,\nor whatever it was. So it took several times he called them back, making him tell him\nwho they were.",
        "A: You mean when I go back to Germany\u2019?",
        "A: You mean --",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have much contact with them, and the ones that tried to be in touch\nwith us, of course, didn\u2019t know anything about it, what -- what was happening, none of\nthem ever did. They were already --",
        "A: -- very innocent, they were very innocent, none of them knew anything, so -- but they\ncame in to the displaced camp, the women, and they tried to do our laundry, because\nthere were no facilities, just for something to eat, because we used to get all these CARE\npackages. The Americans were very good to us, they gave us many CARE packages, but\nthen every CARE package, there was so much of the same thing, that they couldn\u2019t\npossibly consume this. So we always exchanged it for something else that we needed.\nAnd this is what happens. So you had no oth -- other choice but to deal with the local\npopulation on that level.",
        "A: It -- It -- It was, it was, yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Eventually, because when we came again to be interviewed, there was this lady, the\nsecretary, and she was marry -- married to a Polish guy, to areal Polish guy, and I got to\ntalk to her, and then I said to her, what was happening. And she got really upset. She\nwent into this interviewer, and said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s strange that these poor people are being\nheld back, and you know they have nothing, they\u2019re poor, and they\u2019re survivors .All they\nwant to do is get out of here, and you holding them back, and you let go any Tom, Dick\nand Harry which is not Jewish, you letting them go.\u201d He sat there and thought about it,\nand then my husband came in, he did apologize to him, my husband told me. He said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cause you all this heartache. On the next transport you bil -- you\u2019ll be the\nfirst one on the list,\u201d and sure enough, you were, and this is where we went, to\nBremerhaven. And you know what happened? The day we were going to go -- before the\n-- the date that we were going on the boat, they checked the children, agenamy -- again,\nand my daughter had a temperature. Could you believe that? I sat up all night and cried,\nand gave her aspirins, and in the morning they checked her again. Well, the temperature\nhad gone, so they let me go on t-the boat. And let me tell you, all 10 days we traveled, on\nstormy seas, I thought I\u2019d never survive that. I\u2019m never going on another boat again. And\nthen the -- finally pulled in, and New York harbor, it quiet down, you know? And then\nmy husband -- of course we were not together, we traveled on a military boat, so the men\nwere separate, and the women were separate, and because I had a small baby, I was\nprivileged to have a cabin with another woman, separate, private. So, he came into the\ncabin, and if it wouldn\u2019t be for him, I think my child would die of s-starvation, cause I\ncouldn\u2019t lift my head from that bunk. So he came in, and he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so quiet now.\u201d\nWe have to come out on deck and see what was going on. If you -- I went out, and it was\nthe most gorgeous sight I\u2019ve seen. It was at dawn, you know, it\u2019s still dark outside. I\ncould see the lit up harbor, and the first thing, bright, and white lit up, was the Statue of\nLiberty. That was so gorgeous, I\u2019ll never forget that.",
        "A: We came at the end of April, 1951.",
        "A: Of New York. And then we were met by representative, either they were UNRRA, or\nJoint, I don\u2019t know. This is what they call themself for short, I can\u2019t really tell you\nexactly how to say the whole name of them. And they took us to a hotel, we stayed in the\nhotel for several days to rest up. Actually, they wanted to send us to Trenton, New Jersey,\nbut my sister\u2019s destination was in Sheboygan. So she wanted very much for us to be\ntogether, and asked the local people here to intervene, so they would send us here. So we\ncame here. So they -- in New York they gave us tickets and put us on a train, and they put\nus On a passenger -- on a coach passenger train, you know, with a little baby, traveling all\novernight, sitting on a bench. She -- I didn\u2019t know where to lay her down, she cried all\nnight. And people were sitting, and -- and I didn\u2019t know a word of English, or -- or\nwhatever, and I was still very much a timid person out of a camp, looking around, being\nafraid these people are going to scream at me because my child is crying. You know, I\nwas very much afraid.",
        "A: [have a friend, my friend that was in camp with me, she lives in Englewood.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. There were certain cities that took so many people in, and I guess they decided I\nshould go to Trenton, that was it. I don\u2019t know, but maybe I would have had better\nopportunities. We didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunities here. They have a small committee\nhere, they welc-welcomed us, and because my sister was here, they didn\u2019t even find us an\napartment right away, we had to stay with my sister. They gave my husband a job, and as\nfar as looking for a place, we had to do that ourselves. My husband job didn\u2019t earn\nnothing, you know\u201d?",
        "A: Just a factory job. Well, we had no education. There was no one here that said, \u201cWell,\nwe'll -- we\u2019ll see that you get an education and meanwhile see that you have something\nto live on.\u201d Nobody did this here. So we had to right away go to work, and because his\nearnings weren\u2019t enough, I had to go sometimes and help out. What could I do? There\nwas nothing part time I could do in the evening, just babysit or clean somebody\u2019s house,\nthat was it. But then my children got bigger, and I went to work too, full-time, because\nthey were both in school. So I went full-time to work.",
        "A: It was very hard, because let me tell you, in those days, people did not provide you\nwith social workers to get you adjusted, in a new country. We did all the adjusting all by\nourselves. Soon as we got a job, nobody bothered with us. That was it, you got a job,\nyou\u2019re making money, you got to do it on your own. We had people that were very\nhelpful in the places where we worked. They really -- People were kind, telling us how to\ndo -- especially, I met very nice people that said to me, imi -- wa -- I couldn\u2019t speak the\nEnglish, and this a big German town, let me tell you. It helped though, in the beginning,\nthat you could speak the language, you know, and communicate. But then we\ncommunicated and they said, \u201cIf you understand something in English, then say it. We\u2019ll\nhelp you.\u201d You know? We went for awhile to vocational school. It wasn\u2019t a great big\nhelp, it wasn\u2019t, because when you don\u2019t know the language, and people start the\ngrammar, and you don\u2019t even know what is a vowel, or a noun, or whatever it 1s, what\ngood is it to you? I had learned a lot from watching my neighbor\u2019s TV, seeing the\nmotions, and the repeat -- repeated words, and I also liked to read a lot. I started reading,\nI actually didn\u2019t know what I was reading, because the pronunciations here are so\ndifferent. But slowly I got it, and on my own, more on our own, we did it. That\u2019s true.\nBut we needed a vocational school because we could not apply for citizenship if we\ndidn\u2019t go to vocational school, and learn about the government, you know?",
        "A: Yes, we did. We applied right away. Soon as we got our first papers, we did register\nright away. We came in \u201951, in 1957 we were citizens already. This 1s -- We wanted to\nbelong, we loved the country, it\u2019s wonderful. With all it\u2019s faults, it\u2019s the best place to be.\nAll the freedoms a person has, no place to be found.",

And I\nthink sometimes that people go too far in that respect. And another thing that nobody\nstops these people, because they say they\u2019re entitled to these freedoms. It\u2019s like being\nhelpless, you know? With all the freedoms, you\u2019re still helpless to stop something evil\nthat\u2019s going on.",
        "A: All these hate groups. All these things that are -- insults being, or -- or going on public\ntelevision, or on -- on the internet, online, and broadcasting their hate messages, and\nnothing can be done about it, you know\u201d? Poisoning young people\u2019s -- children\u2019s minds\nwith such garbage\u2019? And children are vulnerable. They just don\u2019t go and research, and try\nto find out what is the truth, they -- they really get taken with something like that.",
        "A: Well, in Europe, most of the time the Jews had no rights. I would say we were called\ncitizens, but we had no right, we were always second class citizens, as far as I remember.\nWhen I was a child, you could hear em -- being said, Jew, Jew, all the time, you know?\nAnd even my school, I was always good in languages, you know, always got the best\ngrade in Polish language, so our teacher, an educated woman would say to the class,\n\u2018\u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed that this Jew has the best mark in Polish language?\u201d So we were\nalways aware -- always made aware of it, that we were Jews. Ya -- In court, you were not\nbelievable, because you were a Jew. If anyone had something against you, you were lost,\nunless you could bribe the judge, or whatever.",
        "A: Factory jobs.",
        "A: That\u2019s all we could do. That\u2019s all we were able to do. I could not go work in a office, I\ndidn\u2019t have enough understanding of the office work, you see? And you needed the\ntyping, which I didn\u2019t have. So, wherever the money was coming from, this 1s where we\nwent. I ended up working in a place that manufactured plastic things, and we were\ninspecting all the ready products, making them ready for shipment. So that\u2019s what I did\nfor 29 years.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, he -- he changed, because thank God, that first factory we b-barely -- we chased\nthe rainbow all the time, very poor hours, very poor pay, but then, thank the lord, they\nwent on strike. That was the turning point. Nobody knew when this was going to end, so I\nurged him to go and look for a different job, and then he found another job, which was\nmuch better. If he had that job in the beginning, I could have gone to school and learned\nsomething, but then, by that time, we had children going to school. So we wanted them to\ngo, we did, the both of them went to universities, we saw to that.",
        "A: It was on a -- It\u2019s f -- for them -- for a manufacturing machines to package things. You\nknow, like packaging toilet paper, or packaging foodstuff, and all that. They were\nmanufacturing those machines, that\u2019s what they were doing.",
        "A: No, no. Most of the time we were just -- there were a couple of other survivors, we\nsort of circulated among ourselves, that was it. I was -- I would say I wasn\u2019t even invited\nany place with the local people. I -- I don\u2019t know about the others, I just know we\nweren\u2019t. And most of the friends that we made, we were invited, were not even Jewish.\nWe had a lot of Gentile friends right away in the beginning, helping us a lot. And like\nwhen we bought this house here, actually we hardly had any payment, and people helped\nus paint it, and remodel, and do everything, without anything, and those were not Jewish\npeople that helped us.",
        "A: I have no idea. I think the people here, themself, weren\u2019t that well off before the war.\nThe war gave them opportunities to better themself, and maybe they were busy themself,\ntrying to get somewhere. They were just so absorbed in their trying to make it, that they\nhad no time for anybody else. That\u2019s the only way I can figure.",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "A: That\u2019s the way it should be?",
        "A: I said that. Well, because I think we need to communicate with people other than\nJewish people. I had a great need to understand about other religions, and about other\nplaces, because in Europe we were completely isolated from that. And I learned a great\ndeal from my friends, they learned a great deal from me. And we you learn to respect one\nanother, because of that, and it doesn\u2019t matter what religion they are really, we are always\ngood friends. We do --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Some of them did. And some of them said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it now, it hurts too much.\nMaybe later on.\u201d And finally, I don\u2019t know how -- it started with me talking. Do you\nwant me to talk about that? I don\u2019t know, do you?",
        "A: Well, there was a time when they were speculating about Dr. Mengele, because he\nwas the one in Auschwitz, doing all the experiments, if he was still alive, and that was in\n1985, where that was a big uproar all over the world, trying to figure out where he 1s, or\nwhat\u2019s going on. And the local paper here, wanted to write a story tying in some one of\nthe survivors with Mengele. The only one that was in Auschwitz here, was I. So someone\ndirected a newspaper lady to me. She came and interviewed me, and we talked. I did tell\nher that Mengele met every transport, or, at that time, I wouldn\u2019t know who he was. But\nI\u2019m sure he was there. So she took my life story, she wrote a big article, and she said,\n\u201cTt\u2019ll be in the paper.\u201d Made headlines, you know, it made -- the next day it made\nheadlines, and I started getting phone calls from schools. The first school was in\nHoward\u2019s Grove here, that asked me to come and speak. The teacher -- And I said to her,\n\u201cT don\u2019t feel like coming. I have never spoken in public, and I really -- are you sure you\nwant me to come?\u201d So she said, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201d You know, my first presentation was maybe\n10 or 15 minutes. I was shaking in my boots. But from then on, apparently I did\nsomething right, because she keeps on asking me to come back every year. From then on\nI keep on going. And from then on, from word of mouth, other schools, and it gets to be\nmore and more every year. So, that\u2019s the way it happens with me going out and speaking.",
        "A: Soon as school starts, I get phone calls, and I would say in an average, about five\ntimes a month, for sure. But sometimes it\u2019s even more.",
        "A: Universities, high schools, grammar schools, junior highs, everything. Also church\ngroups, organizations, and civic clubs, all of them. I found many of those.",
        "A: I -- I -- I -- Ido my presentation, mainly the story of my life. I start out just with a\nlittle introduction, and then I talk about myself, and through the liberation. And if it\u2019s a\nschool, then I talk to them about life here, and what they have here, how they should --\ncomparing my life, and how I view the United States when I came here, what we have\nhere, and how appreciative they should be, and really appreciate the life and the schools,\nand everything they have. And point out all these hate groups to them, try to make them\nunderstand that before they commit themself to something like that, they should study,\nand check out the archives and documents, to make sure what is the truth. I always\nemphasize all these things to them. So, and then there\u2019s always a period of questions, of\nlook it up, this picture there, where all these children are? You see that? That was on a\nschool where about 50 of them crowded around, wanted my autograph.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, some of them get -- take a unit in it beforehand, before I come, so they will be --\nthey have some background on it. Most of them do. And they prepare questions ahead of\ntime, which I -- after I\u2019m through, I do answer questions for those children, and they are -\n- I get tons of letters from them, and when I read those, I can see that they paid attention,\nbecause they quote me sometimes, and telling me how appreciative they are that now that\nthey listened to my story, and that they will never say they\u2019re hungry again, or they will\nnever say that they\u2019re underprivileged because they don\u2019t have certain things, and how\nlucky they are to live in freedom. Thanking me for coming and telling my story and\ncalling me a hero for surviving, and maybe that was my goal, that I would be able to\ncome and tell people about this, so people finally realize that we -- we should not hate\none another. This is the most important thing I tell them, that hate is a terrible thing.",
        "A: Some of them say, \u201cUntil you came, it was hard for me to believe, but you\u2019re a living\nwitness to it, so it must be true.\u201d Because what reason, or what would I get out of it,\ncoming here and telling a story like that? So they say, \u201cWe are very much convinced\nnow.\u201d Doubters, you know? And I think what makes me feel good is those responses, and\nwhat makes me more feel good 1s that after walking somewhere in the street, or walking\ninto a store, when a person comes over and says, I heard you speak five years ago in this\nschool, and she still can recognize my face, and remembers what I said, that\u2019s the biggest\nreward a person can get.",
        "A: Not very many. Very seldom someone will say that, yes.",
        "A: Some of them say, \u201cI have a friend that says that\u2019s not true, it never happened. But\nyou\u2019re here, you told me that. I can see it\u2019s true.\u201d So.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My older daughter went to the University of Madison, and my younger daughter went\nto Milwaukee.",
        "A: Both are in New York City.",
        "A: Well, I tell you, my older daughter graduated in social work. She did that for a couple\nof years and decided it was too heartbreaking, and too hard. She did not want that. So she\nwent back, took some classes, and went into insurance and investment, and she\u2019s doing\nvery good. My younger daughter works in a law firm.",
        "A: Well, I did not tell them a lot when they were much younger. The only thing that I\nalways instilled in them, that we are all people, and it doesn\u2019t matter who we are,\neverybody is a friend, if they\u2019re nice people. And they were like that, they made easy\nfriends with non-Gentiles, and gen -- and -- and Jewish people. My kids had tons of\nfriends coming to this place. They had a bedroom, very little room, because this is what\nwe could afford, and the room was small, it -- as a matter of fact, it had bunk beds,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t fit in two beds. But they always had friends, and some of e-even slept\nover, in their place -- in that jammed place, because they liked to be with them. So it was\nalways happy, and full of kids around here, when they were growing up. I wa -- I was\nhappy, too, believe me. Once they left, it was very traumatic to get adjusted.",
        "A: Well, we just tried to tell them that -- we had to tell them, you know, because they\nused to ask about grandparents, other relatives. So this is what came out. That\u2019s what we\nhad to tell them.",
        "A: Of course. Why do -- Why don\u2019t they have a grandma? Why don\u2019t they have a-aunt --\nmore aunts, just one aunt, and one uncle, where other children they associate with have\nbig families, and cousins a lot, and so you have to tell them. Not when they were real\nlittle, they wouldn\u2019t understand that.",
        "A: I would say by the time they were 10, or something like that. Still not everything. 10\nyear old child still isn\u2019t able to comprehend everything.",
        "A: They did, but when I sometimes expressed fear, they always said, \u201cOh Mom, you\u2019re\nliving in the United States, don\u2019t worry about anything here.\u201d They felt very secure here.\nFirst of all, my older daughter, she was a little baby when we came, and my other\ndaughter was born here, so she never knew about, you know, being -- bu -- she -- the\nother one didn\u2019t know either. She only said in the beginning, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m a German\ncitizen, how terrible.\u2019 Because she was born there.",
        "A: Well, in the beginning, none of us really wanted to talk a lot about it, because it\nbrought a lot of heartache. It still does. It -- That will never go away, as long as we will\nlive, never. Beca -- It\u2019s hard to reconcile yourself that the war starts, and you\u2019re a 13 year\nold girl, and the war ends, and you\u2019re an adult on your own, and there\u2019s no one to turn to\nfor advice, what to do, how -- what to do with your life, or how to -- to associate with\npeople, or whatever. So it\u2019s very hard. My young years are gone, from childhood into\nadulthood. It\u2019s -- It -- It is -- A lot of the people can\u2019t understand that, what we missed\nout on.",
        "A: Oh, yes, lot of them. Lot of dreams.",
        "A: Sometimes I dream I\u2019m there. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in a camp, but I\u2019m trying to hide.\nThey\u2019re coming, I\u2019m trying to hide, and every time I\u2019m hiding, I know they coming near\nto find me, and I\u2019m running, trying to find a different hiding place. And I\u2019m running that\nfar, one time I was running so fast I woke up, my heart was beating so fast, I could hardly\ncatch my breath. This is what woke me up. There\u2019s many other dreams, yeah.",
        "A: Once in awhile, yes. Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, La -- I\u2019m very gratified that I do something good, I think I\u2019m doing something --\nbringing a little understanding to children, and some adults. And believe me, some 0 --\nsome of the adults, which I\u2019m very shocked, until I come, say they never heard of it.\nWould you believe that? I had one college girl come over and say she never heard of the\nHolocaust until I came and spoke there. This is gratifying, very much so, and another\nthing, I think is -- when you speak about it, it\u2019s just like therapy, talking it out. At -- It\nfeels like I\u2019m talking my heartache out, and after that 1t makes me feel I\u2019m a little more\ncalm, because of that. It gives me a better feeling, trying to make people understand what\nwas it like.",
        "A: I have tons of books on that subject, and documentaries, I have several. Also, I went to\nsee \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d of course, and there\u2019s a lando -- on PBS, there\u2019s a lot of\ndocumentaries. I try to watch, but sometimes I don\u2019t any more, because I get very bad\ndreams, and sometimes I can\u2019t fall asleep any more. You know, the older you get, and\nbecause we are retired, our minds are more activated towards these happenings. And\nespecially something like that, it triggers so much, that you can\u2019t sleep, or when you fall\nasleep, there are many nightmares.",
        "A: Well, as a Jewish person, before the war, I knew -- like I said, I knew I wasn\u2019t equal to\nthe others, because I wasn\u2019t treated that way, but I always felt I was, in myself. It wa -- It\nwas instilled into me by my parents, that we are good people, and we did not do anything\nwrong, it\u2019s just too bad that other people can\u2019t recognize that. But when I came here, I\nrejoiced in all this freedom, I also look very cautiously on everything, because of the\nthings that I went through. I\u2019m always a little skeptical, and afraid. I\u2019m still afraid,\nbecause of what\u2019s happening with -- with this mushrooming groups of hate, what is going\nto happen? And if they wouldn\u2019t someday prevail. This is what bothers me a lot.",
        "A: I was, mm-hm.",
        "A: I -- We went -- The first time I went back to Poland in 1978, and my hometown, there\nwas one Jew there, of all the people. And there was no cemetery any more, just all the\nstones, just -- they were made on a sidewalk, you know? And after awhile, they were\ntaken out. This Jew asked the Polish government after the war, so he went, and they just\nlaid there, pilots of rubble, you don\u2019t know where they belong. I wanted to go there\nbecause my grandpa was the only one that died natural death, and I wanted to see his\ngrave, but I couldn\u2019t see anything. And I did travel to Poland, I -- I went back to\nAuschwitz, I went back there.",
        "A: Eight. It was -- It was very hard to do that, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s from -- where I lef -- lost\nmy whole family. I wanted to go and say a prayer for them, I wanted to do that. Yes,\nthat\u2019s what I did.",
        "A: Very bad, thinking that I\u2019m back in it, you know? The first thought was, is it really --\nam I really walking here as a free person? It was a eerie feeling, yes.",
        "A: No, not the first time, he didn\u2019t want to go, mm-mm.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: Oh, sure. The marketplace there, the house where -- the place where we lived is there.\nI couldn\u2019t get in, because the people that lived there were working, it was locked, you\nknow. And later on, or even if they were, they were afraid to open the doors. They\nthought maybe I came for something. But it\u2019s there, the building is there, I saw it. I\nwalked around the streets, I walked around where my school was, in the neighborhood,\nall -- all of it, everything\u2019s there, just like I left it. I always say, the little town of Ozercuv\nwithout the Jews, is just like a piece in the Twilight zone, for -- 1t\u2019s teeming with life, you\nwalk out a minute on the street, and come back, a-and it\u2019s dead, nobody is there. And this\nis the way it\u2019s -- did strike me, at that time.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: I would say they improved a little bit, the -- the roads, the s -- the buildings, they\nrenovated some of that. But otherwise, it\u2019s --",
        "A: Otherwise it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s exactly the same. Life goes on without the Jews, you\nknow? It was teeming with Jewish people before the war. There was a lot of industry.\nThe biggest factory of textiles was owned by a Jewish man, and several -- quite a few\nhundred people, Gentiles, all of them were working there and making a living of that.\nNow the factory belongs to the government. It\u2019s still there, so --",
        "A: Well, I feel like that they say they suffered, it\u2019s true. Polish people were also\nexterminated, but they were not exterminated, some of them, for the same reason, not\nbecause they wanted to exterminate a race. They did it because they were afraid of\nuprisings. Th-They did it to political people, and whatever they -- like I always hear\nhomosexuals, or whoever went, they\u2019re going against them. That\u2019s why they did it to the\nPolish people, the intelligentsia, that they shouldn\u2019t be sort of wising up the loc -- the\npopulation to revolts. Those they exterminated. But especially for the reason, just to wipe\nout a race, they didn\u2019t do this to the Polish people like they did to the Jewish people. So,\nwhat I would have to say, that -- in the respect, they didn\u2019t lose what we lost. They still\nhave a country, where we got to be people without homes, no place to go.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t in Germany last time when I was there. I felt that I didn\u2019t want to go and see\nthe country, because I always felt bitter about this big martial plan, where I said, we sat in\nthe displaced camps, with nowhere to go, and here all these millions are being poured\nback in the perpetrator of all these atrocities, making them prosperous, where they sat\nhome, in their own homes. They lost people in the war, they lost homes, of course.\nPeople got killed in the bombings, but they did it to themself, they have no one else to\nblame for it. Still they had a country, they had homes, they had mothers, they had fathers.\nAnd here we were helping them back, to get back to wealth, and here, we that lost\neverything. And they shed our blood. We are sitting in Germany, in displaced camps,\nwith nowhere to go. I felt very, very bitter about that.",
        "A: He -- Yes, he did, later on, he -- we went three years ago, we went. And then that time\nI did go into Germany, because I wanted to see the displaced camp where we lived for so\nmany years, after the war. That\u2019s the only reason I went in there. Otherwise, I had no -- I\nhave no business in Germany.",
        "A: We went back to the camp together, yes, mm-hm. And we traveled. We did go back to\nPoland again. He wanted to go back to Lodz, where he lived. There was a little street, a\nlittle side street, in that big city, the whole street was demolished, there was nothing there\nbut the empty lot.

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Come on, anyone that compares this to a Holocaust doesn\u2019t think straight, because\nKosovo, those two factions, are people that have their land, and each one is fighting for\npossession and power. They fighting each other, right, and it\u2019s -- they\u2019re shedding blood,\nwhich is unnecessary. Things could have been resolved peacefully, but people are too\nhateful, okay. I am very upset about children and people being killed, but don\u2019t ever\ncompare this to the Holocaust. The Jews had no country, we did not start a war with --\nstart a war with Hitler. We were citizens of each country that we lived in, and this is -- we\ntried to live peacefully, we had nothing against anyone. We were simply killed, and tried\nto be exterminated, because we were Jews, simply. The goal -- Hitler\u2019s goal was to\nexterminate the Jewish race. We were not fighting for property, or for a country. We did\nnot have a country. Kosovo, and the Serbs, they have countries, right? They lived side by\nside each other, and each one wanted to dominate, and this is what started it. They fought\none another, okay\u2019? And they -- Whatever happened there, it\u2019s their own fault. They\nbrought it upon themself, I feel sorry for all the people, for the -- like I said, for the little\nchildren -- innocent children -- innocent people being killed. When I see that, I get very\nupset, because it does remind me of World War Two, and of the killings, but you can\nnever compare it to the Holocaust, never.",
        "A: I think that -- I-I\u2019m all for helping, I\u2019m all for helping, because I remember how\nhelpless we were. We looked towards England, and towards the United States, thinking\nany minute that they will come in, and it will be done swiftly, and that we would not have\nto suffer all this. But you see, the problem was that Hitler was bluffing, and the world\nwas afraid, and they let them get away with everything. And he got so big and strong\nbecause -- and it was all the other countries\u2019 fault that they let them get that far.\nEverybody stood by and let them just do it. Nobody interfered. This is what I\u2019m trying to\nsay. If they would interfere right away, so much bloodshed would not have happened.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying -- we have to see, we have to interfere. Of course, I don\u2019t go much\nfor Americans being killed over there. It\u2019s a big tragedy. But I think we have created the\nUnited Nations, all the countries together, should see to it that there should not be any\nwars, and any bloodshed. They should interfere.",

When we go out, there is no kosher restaurants\nhere. So we just try to eat whatever possible we can. But as far as that, I try to observe the\nSabbath. We go to Temple, we belong to the Temple.

And I -- My doubts\nwere, 1s there a God? If He was there, why did He let that happen? Very much, I was very\nangry at God, let me tell you.",
        "A: You sort of -- You have to have something to believe in, otherwise there\u2019s -- there\u2019s\nnothing to live for. I -- I think you have to. And it\u2019s not that I justify what happened, but\nthen you start thinking, and you think there have to be some powers above, that are still\nruling this world, and why this happened, I will never know. So there -- there\u2019s so much\nmystery in this world, and a person has to believe in something.",
        "A: Slowly.",
        "A: I -- I still can\u2019t figure out why it happened. The rabbi\u2019s explanation is that God created\nus with two wills, one good, and one bad, and it\u2019s up to you which way we go, okay? So,\nbut why did the bad got the upper hand, I can\u2019t figure that out.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Incidents about what?",
        "A: I -- I think most of the time, I encountered good people, and through my traveling, I\nmet a lot of people that stick to me, and are friends. We\u2019re in touch, they come and visit\nme, they invite me to their homes. And I\u2019m very happy about that, most of them are\nschoolteachers, and all these other people that -- and when I say -- sometimes make\ncomment that I\u2019m amazed, you know, educated people like that, they really want to be\nmy friends, and they answer me, in a ways, you are more educated than we are. So, I feel\nvery humble, you know, that -- when they tell me that. And I -- The only regret may be\nliving in a small town. Right now, I don\u2019t, because we retired, but when I was younger, I\nfigured, if we would have been in a larger city, maybe we would have had a better\nopportunity to better ourselves financially, because in bigger cities, there were larger\ncommittees, and there were other ways the newcomers were treated. So, I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe we would have been better off. But then, you don\u2019t know the language, and you\ndon\u2019t -- you don\u2019t have money to move around, you just stay where you are. And once\nyou're settled, it\u2019s hard to move.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: My mother used to tell about inventions, people discovered this, or that, or made some\ngadgets, you know how they work. And my father was always busy working, because in\nPoland we had to work many hours to make a living, you know? So he had no time to\nread the paper, and my mom used to sit next to him while he was working, and read the\npaper to him loud. And then when she read about something like that, she should -- used\nto shake her head, and said, \u201cOnly in the United States, things like that could happen.\nThis must be some wonderful place.\u201d You know? And lada -- some of the people that\nimmigrated before the war had relatives sending back letters, and telling him all about the\nbuildings here, and all the things, what was happening. So she always thought it was a\nwonderful place to be, and I was very much impressed by it, and that was always in my\nmind, what she said. When we had a choice of going places, I always wanted to come\nhere.",
        "A: What my mother used to read, and there were all these positive things about what she\nhad said.",
        "A: Oh, I would say very much so, because you know, we lived on a little place, where\neverything was primitive. There wasn\u2019t running water, there were no flush toilets, there\nwas nothing. And I came here, and saw all that you could have, you know, refrigerators,\nyou know, and gas stoves. There was never anything like that when I was a little girl.\nRunning water in the house, a -- a -- a bathroom, and bathtub in the house, where we had\na big tub, you know, all the time. So, I thought it was wonderful, oh. And even now,\nwhen I sit in my dreams, such foolish things, I try to imagine I\u2019m talking to my mother,\nthat she\u2019s sitting next to me, and I\u2019m saying to her, \u201cLook Mom, how wonderful. All you\nhave to do is press a button, and your clothes gets washed. Can you see all these\nwonderful things that are here?\u201d It\u2019s just my mind always thinks back, and I\u2019m trying to\ncarry on a conversation with her, in my mind.",
        "A: Sasha.",
        "A: No, he -- he wants to go in there, I think my husband\u2019s in there.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: That\u2019s fine, no problem. He\u2019s very nosy, he likes to investigate things. See?",
        "A: I'm carrying on a conversation with my mother, or even with my father, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, I would say, in the beginning maybe not, because the closeness with the families\nwas always there, even in -- and the other people\u2019s lives here. People were much closer in\nfamilies than they are now. Children and parents were together, things were done\ntogether, and I was always invited to people\u2019s homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that.\nEverybody sat down at the table, the children were there, our children were there. And s -\n- \u00a7 -- conversing afterwards. So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn\u2019t have,\nit was compensating very much. The only hard time was when it came to our holidays.\nSo, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the table, and you thought of the\nwonderful times you had at home, surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition. And\nall of a sudden, all of this is gone, and that\u2019s what it is, hard facts of life.",
        "A: You know, off-hand, I can\u2019t think of it, but probably by the time you\u2019re gone, I would\nsay I should have said this, or I should have said that, and that\u2019s what probably will\nhappen. I just -- I don\u2019t know. I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who\nthink time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that 1t should be\nleft behind. You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don\u2019t have any\ngrandchildren, it\u2019s hard to take this. They just elected to be career women. Yeah, I would\nlike to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I\ncompensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know\nabout it anyway. So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me. And\nmany schools also tape me, and they have that on their files. And I go, for the fourth time,\nI went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University. And they always tape it, they considered\nthis a lecture. And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they\nfile in their files there, so that -- that\u2019s something that I think is very good.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think maybe for awhile it will persist, but I\u2019m afraid with time, it might just be\nsomething in the archives that now and then, someone will look it up for some reference.\nThis is the way it probably will be, sadly. I say that very sadly. In the beginning, maybe,\nthe first several years after we are gone, it will be still carried on, but later on, I don\u2019t\nknow. That\u2019s what I think will happen.",
        "A: Yes, I think it\u2019s very important it should be remembered, and I do worry about that,\nbut I -- 1t\u2019s beyond me, you know? Once we gone, we gone, there\u2019s nothing we can do\nabout it.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s true.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s true. That it very true. I-I tell you why, because the initiative has no -- had not\nbeen taken by Jewish leaders here. We, the survivors alone tried to organize these things.\nYou see, the survivors themself, organize the Yom HaShoah day. It wasn\u2019t national like it\nwas now, but I remember from early days on, we used to go to Milwaukee, and all -- all\nof us survivors get together somewhere, and observe Yom HaShoah day, but later on,\nwhen it got to be more popular, then local officials joined, and it got to be on -- ona\nwider scale, and this is the way it happened. But we, the survivors, started that ourselves.\nOf course, we didn\u2019t have all this power to get it on such a large scale. The Holocaust\nMuseum did a lot to -- too, you know, to make this happened.",
        "A: Yes, mm-hm. Locally here, we hardly did anything, if we the few survivors didn\u2019t\ntake the initiative to do something, but now, for two years, they are having like ca --\nsending out letters to the schools here, and they should write a theme on why the\nHolocaust should be remembered, and they reward them with prizes, and a get together,\nand a little ceremony. But this is only the second year that they\u2019ve been doing it here\nlocally. Otherwise it never had been done.",
        "A: My husband and I always used to go to Milwaukee.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine.",
        "A: I -- \u2019ma blank right now.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Were you -- Are you satisfied with what I have to say?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, you\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s very nice of you to come and take your time, and I\u2019m glad\nyou came, and we had this nice talk.",
