        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Her maiden name was Krasova.",
        "Q: So is there a relation?",

        "Q: Right. So your name now Is --",
        "A: I shortened it to Krasa, soon as we emigrated from Czechoslovakia, I dropped the o-v-a.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "A: I was born in Prague. I was born in downtown Prague, at home.",
        "Q: At home?",
        "A: At home. And it\u2019s a -- the house is there standing because it used to be an old palace.\nAfter World War I, there was a shortage of apartments, they converted some of the\npalaces into apartments, and in one of the part -- palaces, we had an apartment. So it was\nvery interesting and it\u2019s still standing there, it\u2019s one of the old houses.",
        "Q: Now, I know you don\u2019t like to give your birthdate, but I\u2019m going to ask you if you\u2019ll give\nyour birthdate, please?",
        "A: Ill give it to you, because this is for posterity, and I\u2019m not going to play around. I was\nborn September 24, 1923.",
        "Q: Right. Now, I'd like to get an idea about your family, and how you were living, so tell me\nsomething about your father, and then your mother. What was your father like, and what\ndid he do for a living?",
        "A: My father was a disciplinarian. We were very -- he was very strict with us. And he was a\nself man made. He came from a poor family. I don\u2019t know exactly what my grandfather\ndid. I knew his parents, because both were living at that time when I was up to about s --\nwhen I was about six, my grandfather died. My grandma died in Terezin. So I knew her\nvery well. And he grew up in a little town called Votice, in at -- 12 years, he went to\nPrague to go to a high school, to a -- that time it was called [indecipherable], which is for\na s-scientist, like MIT or something like that. And from the age of 12, he was supporting\nhimself, he paid for his studies, all his schools were private, and he supported his parents.\nAnd when he that to us, we had never really a knowledge what it meant until we were\nmuch older, and understood what he must have been, to come from a little village to a big\ntown, and no money, and take care of himself. Because he said always, \u201cYou have it\neasy, I pay your school, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d Which was true. My mother on\nthe o -- other hand, came from a very well-to-do family, and the interesting thing 1s that I\ndon\u2019t have a wedding picture of my parents. They got married in Prague, in a civil\nwedding, not a Jewish wedding. So I think she just went and married him, and maybe my\ngrandfather was -- grandparents didn\u2019t even know about it when they did it, because she\ncame from a well-to-do family, my g -- father was from a poor family. I don\u2019t know, they\nnever spoke about it.",
        "Q: So do you think that her family didn\u2019t approve?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t have a mother, it was only her father at that time.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But my aunt had a chur -- a synagogue wedding -- synagogue wedding in Votice, so --\nand had a party there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t know, my mother was a little rebel --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- and very independent, and very ahead of her times in everything.",
        "Q: Wer -- was your mother and father similar age, was there an --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There was?",
        "A: Yes, three years difference, so that was a normal age difference. My father was three\nyears younger -- ay -- older. My mother was three years younger.",
        "Q: So how would you describe their relationship and their personality? They sound like very\ndifferent people.",
        "A: I think with our education in growing up, we were mostly guided by mother. Mother was\nthe person who decided what we do, what we learn. For example, Mother was very --\ndecided from the first that I have to go to gimnasium, I have to study, because sh -- not\nevery girl marries, and you have to be able to stand on your own feet. That was hers -- so\nthat was very far ahead of those days.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: And my father was concentrated on the prince, on the heir, my brother, who was older\nthan I was. He was studying with him, he was checking what he learned -- math was very\nimportant, my father was an engineer.",
        "Q: So he was focused on your brother?",
        "A: More focused on my brother.",
        "Q: And your brother\u2019s name?",
        "Q: My brother\u2019s name in Czech is Yearje, which was pretty popular for that generation. In --\nin English it\u2019s George, translated. And as I say, they were very -- he was always very\npushing -- very much pushing my brother, how he studies. He wasn\u2019t checking on me,\nbut mother took care of that. And so my brother really jumped a grade. He went from\nfourth grade already to gimnasium.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Where normally it was fifth grade, and that was good because in the end he still could\nmatriculate with the last class, they matriculated before they closed schools in \u201939. He\nmatriculated in June, \u201939.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He wouldn\u2019t have if -- if he didn\u2019t jump the grade.",
        "Q: So he was born in 1920?",
        "A: 21.",
        "Q: In \u201921, I thought three years.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, I see.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Were you jealous of the fact that your father focused on him?",
        "A: No, not really. Not really, because on the other hand, if we fought, or if we did\nsomething, he always got it, and not me. He was the strong -- he was -- he was chubby,\nand I was skinny, and so I was the little girl, the princess who nothing should be done to,\nand he -- he got it. If we did break something, he got it, not me. So --",
        "Q: Were you --",
        "A: -- w-we were not jealous of each other, we had a very close relationship.",
        "Q: So you were close?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you play a lot together?",
        "A: Yes. My -- my -- my brother was the older one, so he was schlepping me along\nsometimes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I loved that, and -- and when we were older the girls liked me, because he was very\ngood looking, and they tried to get near him. So I had good advantages of having an older\nbrother --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- like my brother.",
        "Q: And what was the apartment like, since it was a -- 1-inside of it --",
        "A: It was very huge because the rooms were very big, but they didn\u2019t have the amenities that\na modern apartment had, and we did move 1-in fifth grade, when I went to fifth grade, we\nmoved to a more modern apartment, in different part of Prague. This was near the old\nsquare, these were the old houses, and they did have running water but they didn\u2019t have\ncenter heating or anything like that. You have the big stoves with tiles around them, and -\n- but this was very comfortable, it was big, and it -- 1t wasn\u2019t bad. You had to walk up,\nand there were no elevators, you know, it was a old, old house. People still live in these\nhouses in Prague today.",
        "Q: Really? Would you have been considered upper middle class, middle class, or up --",
        "A: Upper middle class, I think, yeah.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re very comfortable?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that anything was ever not given to us because there wouldn\u2019t be\nenough or -- all it a -- had to be, wh-whether my father will allow it or not. And --",
        "Q: Not whether --",
        "A: -- we went on vacation, we traveled to Yugoslavia. I mean, there was never question. But\nmy mother was still frugal, she did not like to throw around money, but I don\u2019t think\nthere was any problem with money all our lives.",
        "Q: And y -- you traveled on vacation oh -- oh --",
        "A: Every vacations.",
        "Q: Did you --",
        "A: The next day after school we were for two months out of Prague, and my father would\ncome on weekends, or spend the week with us, but we were with my mother, out the\nwhole two months.",
        "Q: Really? The two months? And what -- where would you be, like would -- she would rent\na house, or an apartment?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Th-Those were villas where people rented part of it, or something. That was\ndone not just us, all our friends were living the same way, the company we had were\nliving the same way. The girls -- not all the girls in school, because there were poor girls\nin school too, the -- were mixed. But the friends we had, the Jewish friends all lived the\nsame way.",
        "Q: So did you often travel to the same place for those two months [indecipherable]",
        "A: For a few years we always did. I remember we -- there -- there were several places where\nwe went in Czechoslovakia, then we were going to Austria for a couple years, or maybe\nthree years. Then we went to Yugoslavia, and then Hitler stop it. And it started with the\nSudeten, and then they didn\u2019t go after.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: \u00b037 we were the last time on a vacation in Yugoslavia, and \u201937 in -- in -- over Christmas\nwe were in Vienna, and then it stopped.",
        "Q: So, in the --",
        "A: We were every year in Vienna because my aunt lived in Vienna.",
        "Q: I see. And wh -- is there sort of a tradition for the more wealthy to leave Prague?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Two months seems like an awfully long time.",
        "A: Well, that was the school vacation.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. It was hot, and dusty, and it was the town so you were outside, and that\u2019s where we\ncould play tennis and do things.",
        "Q: And what did your father do?",
        "A: My wa -- father was -- they called him director, it\u2019s th-the ravuss, the executive office, or\nwhatever you call. There was a big factory called Odkolek. He didn\u2019t stop there, he\nworked first with the [indecipherable] but I was too young at that time. That had about 80\nstores in Prague, that -- had a lot of employees, big factory and -- outside of Prague. They\nhad bread, they had chocolate, they had cakes, they had all the -- it was something like\nGeneral Mills, or something, you know, but they didn\u2019t produce for others, only for their\nown shop.",
        "Q: For their own stores?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So he was a big shot at that time in our eyes, maybe there were some bigger ones. We did\nnot own it, because the rich Jews owned the factories. This was owned by a board of\ndirectors. I mean it was -- what do you call? They had the shares of that, and they were\nmo -- a-all Jews. And the day Hitler came, my father lost his job and -- and they ran\naway, most of them [sneezes |",
        "Q: Bless you.",
        "A: Most of them emigrated to Canada, the di -- the board of directors.",
        "Q: But your father stayed?",
        "A: Unfortunately.",
        "Q: Now, when you were growing up, what kind of a kid were you? Do you remember\nyourself as a kid?",
        "A: Well, I remember myself as spoiled brat, I --",
        "Q: What do you mean when you say that?",
        "A: I could get out of my father anything I wanted.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: My m -- in my case my mother was the strict one. For example, we got our pocket\nmoney, and we had to manage our pock -- pocket money, but I wasn\u2019t a good manager.\nI'd spend it in the beginning, and I didn\u2019t have for the end of the week, and my brother\nwouldn\u2019t lend me, because he said you should have managed better. And I would go to\nmy father, and hug him and kiss him, and get some money, so that my mother doesn\u2019t\nknow. And I knew how to handle him, even though he was very strict.",
        "Q: So even though he wasn\u2019t focused on you because you weren\u2019t the male heir --",
        "A: He was there focus, but --",
        "Q: He really was very focused on you.",
        "A: -- he was focused, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We wouldn\u2019t dare to bring a bad mark from school, because that was punishable, we\nwouldn\u2019t get money, or something. We were always trying to get -- because we had -- we\nfelt we had to, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I -- [remember one thing, I came home -- we were two -- this is more in the gimnasium,\nafter the fir -- five grades. I came -- there was one more girl -- Jewish girl in the class,\nsome were maybe mixed, but they didn\u2019t declare themselves, we were two Jewish, full\nJewish girls in the class, and she\u2019s still living, she survived the camp. We\u2019re still friends,\nshe lives in New Jersey. And we knew -- we -- the two of us knew German, because my\nmother wanted us to learn languages, and I had to learn French and German. And I\nwasn\u2019t allowed to learn English. And we knew perfect -- we spoke -- for us it was a\nspoken language, you still had to learn the grammar, it\u2019s the -- like in any language, but\nwe could communicate and we could talk. And the teacher was very nasty to the two of\nus, SO of course we said she\u2019s an anti-Semite. So I came home and I told my mother, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do anything with this teacher. She\u2019s not going to give me the right mark because\nshe doesn\u2019t like me and Erika, we are -- because we are Jewish.\u201d And my mother just put\nme around, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t care why she doesn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re going to find that\nmany people don\u2019t like you in life. You have to be so good that even if she doesn\u2019t like\nyou, she has to give you the good mark.\u201d And that was it, I could never tell her that\nteacher is against me, or anything because it wouldn\u2019t help. [indecipherable] perfect.",
        "Q: And what happened with that teacher, did you end --",
        "A: We had to study, we went together and didn\u2019t -- we did try to be better than the others.",
        "Q: And were you?",
        "A: Well, I got my good mark.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t -- when we -- we lost her, you know, in -- every year they change.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And that -- that\u2019s -- my mother had no pity over me.",
        "Q: But she taught you a good lesson.",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in [indecipherable] when we went into a store and we had to behave better,\nbecause people shouldn\u2019t say the Jews are loud, or something, you know? We grew up\nwith that, that we are different, and we have to behave differently, too.",
        "Q: Well tell me about that. Yo-You -- were you living in a -- in a -- were -- going to school\nwith Jews and with Christians?",
        "A: Yes. And -- and --",
        "Q: You were? And it was okay?",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism openly, never. But our parents made us aware that\nthere are people li -- that won\u2019t like us, and that we have to behave not to stand out. The\nJews were always afraid not to stand out and that was the difference from the Israelis,\nwho don\u2019t care what the other people think about you. The Jews were very caring what\nsomebody else will say about you.",
        "Q: So -- so there was a kind of fear --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that even if you didn\u2019t see something overt, it could happen if you weren\u2019t careful.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Were -- were you raised as a religious person, or not?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. We celebrated Jewish holidays, celebrated Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and\nPassover. Hanukah we got gifts, but there was a little tree, because we had servants, we\nhad maids, so for the maid had to be tree. And if a maid got a present, we got one too.\nBut we celebrated Hanukah. When we didn\u2019t have maids any more, we never had a tree.\nAnd otherwise we celebrated the Jewish holidays, but not the little ones, we never knew\nPurim we never knew, Shavuot, or Sukkot, or anything like that. We knew only the big\nones.",
        "Q: And what were considered the big ones?",
        "A: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Passover, Seder, one day.",
        "Q: But no -- and --",
        "A: Not the whole 10 days, we did o-only two days we didn\u2019t eat bread.",
        "Q: And Hanukah, you celebrated, but not as a big holiday?",
        "A: Hanukah we did, and not as a big holiday, we -- we lit the candles, and we got gifts, and\nthat was it. Only one night we lit the candles, we didn\u2019t do it every night.",
        "Q: I -- I want to go back to your being given pocket money. So you\u2019re given pocket money\nevery week, and what are you supposed to do -- what were you supposed to be doing with\nthis money, what was it for?",
        "A: For our own pleasure, for if we want -- if we want to buy ourself something 1n school\ninstead of the lunch Mother gave us. And if we wanted more than Mother thought it\u2019s\nnecessary for me to have. I would have gifts. We saved for gifts for Mother and Father.\nAnd we wouldn\u2019t get special money for that, and it was expected that we give something.\nSo we got pocket money.",
        "Q: So if you were s --",
        "A: If you bought yourself some ice cream --",
        "Q: Or if you would go to --",
        "A: My mother wanted us to be able to handle money, and since I remember -- I don\u2019t know\nwhen it started -- I think, in my opinion, started in sixth grade, because we didn\u2019t have --\nwe didn\u2019t have possibility buying lunches in fifth grade, in grad -- in grade schools. We\nwent home for lunches. So I think it started in sixth grade, and we could have lunch from\nhome, but I liked the lunches what the other [indecipherable] were buying. So that went\nfor my money. By the time sixth grade, we went to concerts, we went to the theater, we\nwent to movies by ourselves. We had to pay for it from our pocket money, which I spent\n[indecipherable] Sunday, sometimes all.",
        "Q: And you would not have anything -- when would you get the money, by the way?",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "Q: Every Saturday.",
        "A: Every Saturday, and I only got it if my closet and my room was clean.",
        "Q: Ah. So you worked hard to keep your closet --",
        "A: No, only five minutes before, I [indecipherable] it up. Which my mother always said,\nthat\u2019s not [indecipherable], you\u2019re to keep it all week, but [indecipherable], but she\ncouldn\u2019t change me.",
        "Q: But you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting that you call yourself a spoiled brat. It seems as if\nyou\u2019re spoiled in relationship to your father --",
        "A: But --",
        "Q: -- not in relationship to --",
        "A: -- my mother too. She made sure we played tennis, we -- we really had everything, you\nknow? Not -- I didn\u2019t grow up like a girl that had to work, you know?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t grow up without things. We had toys. My father made me a whole furniture --\ndoll -- for dolls, which he hand carved from -- you know, he was very handy with his\nhands, he was a -- he was also very nice, and draw beautifully, so we ne -- never got\nbooks to color, but he would make pictures for me to color, pictures of flowers, and I\nwould color them.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: We really had a easy life.",
        "Q: Do you think that you were selfish?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, we were -- we were taught to share, and we shared with my brother, and\nI did my sharing with my friends. I don\u2019t think I was ever selfish. Nobody was that I\nknew. Our house was very open, a lot of people came, mostly Mother\u2019s family, my father\ndidn\u2019t have family. She was very close with her sister, that\u2019s why we went -- she spent\nvacation with on -- us, she\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- my aunt was like a second mother to me. And I spend vacation with her in Austria, she\n-- when I was rough -- five years old. And well, my parents were very giving, so I don\u2019t\nthink we were selfish, [indecipherable] my brother.",
        "Q: Because of your characterization of you -- when someone calls themselves a spoiled brat,\nthey\u2019re often an extremely difficult person to be around. But your parents were teaching\nyou discipline, and teaching you a certain kind of responsibility, and respect.",
        "A: Discipline definitely, discipline definite.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You had to greet every time you came, just stand there till you can greet them. We had to\nhad to sit at the table and not talk, because that\u2019s impolite. If you made a spot on the\nwhite tablecloth, that was an affair, you know? We were raised strictly in how we behave.",
        "Q: So in -- at dinner, there was no s -- talking.",
        "A: No, after dinner.",
        "Q: After dinner? At the table, or you were [indecipherable] the table?",
        "A: At the table. What happened is my mother wanted my father and my brother to get close\ntogether. She found some old letters, and old stamps, so she brought them, and my father\ngot interested in stamps. Old Austrian stamps since 1850, since stamps started to be --\nand my brother, they -- and they were sitting every night working on the stamps, and you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, and you couldn\u2019t move the table, and I hated it. And Mother knew we\nwould do our knitting, our -- she taught me crochet, she taught me to embroider. We\nwould do our things like good Jews. We were always [indecipherable] together, we were\nnot, as kids, allowed to go out at night. And it was a rule, seven o\u2019clock was dinner, so\nafter dinner we had to do something. We\u2019d listen to the radio. We didn\u2019t have anything. I\nremember working on those stamps, and that was their hobby. The stamps, a lot of them\ngot saved, and my nephew has them.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: My brother\u2019s -- my brother inherited them, because I never wanted to have anything to do\nwith them, even after the war. And then my nephew inherited them from my brother. So\nthey still exist, and it\u2019s a old, Austrian collection that supposedly is valued, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I have no idea about stamps.",
        "Q: Were your parents affectionate?",
        "A: Yes, and we were a kissing family, and very much so. That\u2019s why we had to kiss every\ntime you leave, every time you came back. But we were a very affectionate family.",
        "Q: Right. What did you like in school, was -- were there particular subjects that you were\nattracted to?",
        "A: Yes, history and geography, that is mine. Hated math.",
        "Q: Hated math. No wonder you were uncomfortable with the money.",
        "A: And no wonder my father didn\u2019t bother with me, and ma -- my brother was a math\ngenius.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: My brother was very bright. He spoke five languages, and he was really very bright. On\nhim it was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And was there something particular about history that you liked, since history is -- was it\nhistory of Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: Yeah, the old Greek and Roman history interested me, loved that. All the stories about\nthe gods, and things like that.",
        "Q: Did you want to study Greek?",
        "A: No, because I went into rryad gimnasium where you don\u2019t have Greek. You see the\nschools, are -- I didn\u2019t tell you the [indecipherable] gimnasium where there was Greek\nand Latin. The arr gimnasium where they kept only Latin. [indecipherable] in riyad,\nwhere they had the math and the sciences only, no Latin and no Greek. So from the riyad\ngimnasium where I went, you could go to both colleges, to the sciences, and to the\nuniversity. But the others weren\u2019t geared directly. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same today, I have\nno idea how it is -- things are there today. But you had to made a test, right, where you\ncan go. And the pressure was tremendous, and my brother made the test from the fourth\ngrade, and he was young -- a year older, I went in fifth grade for that test, and I thought I\nwill die if I don\u2019t get in, because my mother wanted me so strongly to study. But I did\npass, and God, I cried when they read the names in class, and I came out with tears, and I\nknew my mother thought I failed.",
        "Q: But you --",
        "A: Because I was so nervous and so tense that I let go of [indecipherable]. And as a reward\nwe went for ice cream.",
        "Q: And how old were you then?",
        "A: I was -- and in fifth grade.",
        "Q: So you were --",
        "A: 10 and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: 10-11, 10-11 years old.",
        "A: That was end of [indecipherable], so I was 10.",
        "Q: Right. So you really liked school, when you liked the subjects?",
        "A: I loved school --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: When it came that I had to leave, I was devastated that I couldn\u2019t study any more, that --\nthat was, for me end of the world I wanted -- but then burns, my father said, \u201cThis will --\nwar will be over soon [indecipherable].\u201d You know, all this --",
        "Q: Right, that\u2019s what everybody thought",
        "A: -- six months and you\u2019ll be home.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were saying even two months, some people, not six months.",
        "Q: We have to stop the tape --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- and change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Hana, do you have any way of explaining why your mother was so ahead of her time?\nFor a woman of her time to say you may not get married, so you have to be able to be\nindependent, you have to be educated. It\u2019s very unusual. Where -- where do you think\nthat came from?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think my mother, as I said, was a little rebel of -- in her young days,\nbecause she told me little stories, when she got punished. Her mother looked so strict and\nsevere. And she loved her parents, and I went to the cemetery every time with her to visit,\nand she always cried, so I knew she loved them, and she -- I thought, how could\nsomebody love grandma, who looked so strict and -- and she lost her mother when she\nwas 2() years old, and had to take care of the whole -- my grandfather had a far -- big\nfarm, with employees, and things like that, not a small where he was the farmer himself.\nAnd she had to handle all the men, there had to be cooked for all the employees. And she\nhas to take care -- I mean, she was 20. She also went to school -- not to a gimnasium,\nbecause they didn\u2019t exist in villages, but to a school for girls, to -- they call it pensionnat,\nand they learn behavior, serving, cooking, and you know, some subjects, too. Which was\nunusual, so maybe that\u2019s where she got her independence. And I don\u2019t think my father\nliked all that inva -- dependence sometimes because when she wanted for us to do it, and\n-- and do other things, my father didn\u2019t want always to do it, they might have a little fight\nabout it, but there were no serious fights, there were -- there were regular squabbles\nbecause we -- she wanted us to play tennis, and all -- swim and do things. My father\ndidn\u2019t think it\u2019s important or should be, or the girls should do it, too, you know? We did\nall the sports from very early age. Mother felt very important. You had to learn tennis, we\nloved it. We had to learn skiing. She tried to ski with us, but she couldn\u2019t keep up with\nus, and gave it up because she always had to be with us, my father wouldn\u2019t let us go --",
        "Q: Without her.",
        "A: -- without her. And we -- the swimming I started at a very early age, and I did dancing, I\ndid gymnastics, I played piano. We had all -- everything was because my mother wanted;\nto travel too. My mother wanted us to see foreign countries, and -- the only thing that I\nremember when I started to be little older, and I loved the American movies, or s --\nEnglish movies, I wanted to learn English, and I was not allowed. English is for\nbusinessmen, not for young girls.",
        "Q: And this your mother said?",
        "A: Yes, I had to learn French. French is for girls. So when I came back in \u201945, I immediately\nstarted to learn English, cause I always wanted that.",
        "Q: And did you want it because you -- you thought you wanted to come to the United States,\nor just wanted --",
        "A: No, I wanted it because I wanted to understand those movies --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- | -- | ]-liked the sound of the language, I didn\u2019t like French. Especially after \u201938, I was\nhating the French, what they did to us. The British did it too, I didn\u2019t know that. Silly.\nAnd I wanted to learn English, and I started in \u201945, and by \u201947 when I went to England, I\nspoke English. I was so di -- when I am determined, I do it.",
        "Q: That sounds like it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you loved the American movies more than the movies of other countries?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wh-Why do you think?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I admired them. \u201cGone With The Wind,\u201d came only after the war, and I\nmaybe saw it 10 times.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I loved that movie. When I had to leave school, there was \u201cSnow White and the Seven\nDwarfs,\u201d on, and my father, as a -- to lessen the pain that I have -- they knew I -- I -- I\nwas unhappy about leaving school, but there was nothing they could do, and so he took\nme to the movies for that, you know? And that was the last time I was in the movies,\nbecause right afterwards it was forbidden to go to the movies.",
        "Q: To go to the movies.",
        "A: So I loved anything, we -- you know, it\u2019s interesting, when we were little, when you went\nto a movie, there were -- we saw Charlie Chaplin movies, there was always the Fox news\nbefore, and then a cartoon. And all this was in English, and I couldn\u2019t understand, I had\nto read. The reading wasn\u2019t so easy when I was little, so I wanted to understand. I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe that was the reason.",
        "Q: And did you have favorites when -- how young were you when you went to the movies,\nfive or six years old?",
        "A: Yeah, tha -- for the cartoons.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We got them later than you do.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, they came to Europe later, \u201cPopeye\u201d and all that. So we loved cartoons like\nthe kids love today. Not the crazy ones, but we liked the regular cartoons.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they had special performances for children, but once we went to school and had\nfriends, we could go on our own to movies, and that\u2019s when we had to pay for it. As long\nas we went with my father sun -- Sunday morning, we didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: He would pay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But if you went on your own --",
        "A: But on -- later on my parents did not go with us, we -- we went to the national -- there\nwas part of the school, it was -- they made student programs, and the student programs\nmeant that you got cheap tickets from -- from -- as -- as long as you were a student. And I\nwas only 10 years old, we went on our own to concerts, on our own to the opera. And that\nwas sun -- Saturday afternoon, and that was our program, Saturday after -- sun --\nSaturday morning we wents there to school, Saturday afternoon we went to the theater, or\nto the concert. Sunday we went to the movies.",
        "Q: And that young you were going to opera and concerts?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because it was part of our schooling.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: As a matter of fact we had to sometimes write a report about it, that was expected of us to\ngo and hear it.",
        "Q: And did you study opera in school?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Nnn.",
        "Q: It simply -- this was just normal? This was --",
        "A: This was normal. One subject was music. So sometimes you had singing, sometimes you\nhad history of music. Sometimes you learned about the composers, mostly Czech --\nmostly Czech music, and Mozart because Mozart was favorite of the Czechs because he\nwrote in -- in park, he wrote -- got not -- you know, mostly the Czech composer.",
        "Q: So then how --",
        "A: Rorchak, and Smetana, and Such, and the --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Right. And d-you -- d -- whose operas did you see, mainly?",
        "A: Mostly it was Rorchaks, and Smetana, because those were the popular operas. But we\nsaw Tosca, we saw Carmen. I mean, we went whatever the program was.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: Much ma -- my parents never went to a concert with us, we went with my brother, and\nmy friends.",
        "Q: Interesting. And did you sit in the back?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: Because it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- we tried to save money, we -- we didn\u2019t buy the expensive tickets, no.",
        "Q: Right. And when you went to --",
        "A: There was a special student prices, too.",
        "Q: I was going to ask whether there was special prices.",
        "A: Yeah, and they\u2019re right in the back, we didn\u2019t sit in the orchestra.",
        "Q: Right. And were there s -- concerts that you preferred? Did you prefer orchestra, did you\nprefer piano, violin --",
        "A: Piano.",
        "Q: Piano.",
        "A: And then in Terezin too, I used to go to Sommer-Herz, to listen to her all the time.",
        "Q: But you were playing piano all along, is that right?",
        "A: Yes, but I -- I -- neither my brother nor my -- nor me were very musical, I don\u2019t think so.\nMy father was -- had a tremendous ear for music. But it was part of the education, you\nhad to go through with it. And only when it was forbidden did I miss it, because I had to\npractice every day when I was little, half an hour, then later an hour. And the watch was\non the piano so that I don\u2019t practice a minute longer. So it wasn\u2019t in me, the music. It was\nonly because I had to do it.",
        "Q: You had to do it.",
        "A: But again, when you lose it, then -- my brother to give up his violin, I -- they -- we had to\ntake out the piano and give it up, it wasn\u2019t allowed, Jews to have. I wanted to play then,\nand then it was not possible.",
        "Q: Then you couldn\u2019t, I see.",
        "A: But just to tell you how part -- and we were in Israel and we had very little, but when\nDanny, our oldest son was five years old, he had to learn piano. I thought that\u2019s an omen,\nthat has to be. We didn\u2019t have a piano, we didn\u2019t have a refrigerator, the first thing I\nbought was a piano for him.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No refrigerator, icebox. No stove, just the kerosene, but the piano was in the house. And\nwhen we came to Boston, I bought a piano for 25 dollars, that the kids can play piano. So\nth-that was what I was used to.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you start trying to play again?",
        "A: Here and there, but I\u2019m not good at.",
        "Q: You\u2019re not good.",
        "A: I can still read notes, but I\u2019m not good. I have never been really good. You had\nperformances for the parents, you know, that had recitals that had to be so that the teacher\nshows what she did. But I was never good at that.",
        "Q: Did you like to perform?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t like to be in public?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. About anything?",
        "A: Ah, in dance I didn\u2019t mind it.",
        "Q: In dance?",
        "A: In dance I didn\u2019t mind it. In the gym -- gymnastics I didn\u2019t mind, cause I felt secure that I\nwas good at sports, but music, no, I wasn\u2019t so good.",
        "Q: And were you doing modern dance, or you\u2019re doing ballet?",
        "A: First I was doing gymnastics.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And that was with a German deutsche toonfuray. And then my mother didn\u2019t want that I\nget muscles, because --",
        "Q: What is a deutsche toonfuray?",
        "A: That was real German, German speaking gymnastics, and later on it was very\n[indecipherable] oriented, but I was there very early. And so she took me out, and I did\ndo dancing. Not ballet, but dancing, so there was more like -- not modern dances, it was\nlike dancing, you know.",
        "Q: Was it at -- ballroom dancing?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, it wasn\u2019t that either.",
        "A: No, it was like a ballet except dancing, you didn\u2019t stand on your toes.",
        "Q: Toes.",
        "A: You were doing waltz or in group dancing the girls, and that\u2019s what we had the\nperformances.",
        "Q: Right. And y -- did you have a -- one live-in maid, or you had --",
        "A: We had, when we were little, there were a lot of people around, I don\u2019t know. But we had\na nanny that stayed faithful to us, and we loved her very dearly. After that she got\nmarried, she would still come and help Mother, but al -- we had later on only one lived-in\n-- live-in maid.",
        "Q: But when you were younger, there were a lot of people around doing things.",
        "A: There were -- there were lot of people around that cook -- I don\u2019t know where they lived\nall, I don\u2019t know. We -- I remember only one live-in maid, but they were coming in and\nout, and the nanny was there. We loved her, so she took care of us. And she was from the\nsame village where mother was. She brought her in -- into Prague. And she died shortly\nafter the war. And she was the only one, where my parents le -- ta -- some money, and\nshe immediately said, \u201cI give you the money back.\u201d So we said, \u201cNo, we divide it into\nthree,\u201d my brother, me and her, because she didn\u2019t have an easy life. The other people\nsaid, \u201cYour parents gave it to us, when they come back we give it to them.\u201d They never\ngave it to us. Even though we told them my parents are not coming back.",
        "Q: Right. I --",
        "A: But she did. That was our nanny. But she died in 40 s -- \u201946, beginning.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: She was very sick when we came back.",
        "Q: Things start changing in \u201938 and \u201939, don\u2019t they?",
        "A: It started really for us in \u00b038, when Hitler occupied Austria, anschluss. Because mother\u2019s\nsister lived with her husband in Austria, and in June they moved to Prague. They were the\nones who told us the horror stories about Jews washing -- I mean, being beaten in the\nstreets, having to wash the pavement. But they were not taken because they were still\nCzech citizens. So they didn\u2019t touch them. And they got an apartment near us, and that\nwas the year [indecipherable] was very high. Czech screaming we will never give up, we\nwill fight, before Munich. And that summer, there was a -- the Czech organization called\nSokol was very patriotic, was all -- like a Olympiad. And all the schools took part in it,\nand then we marched through pr -- Prague. And I marched with my school, I took part in\nit with my school, my brother took part in it with his school. And we were all very\nchauvinistics, the Czechs were never -- we will fight, and -- the Germans, and we will\nnever give up. And my uncle who came from Vienna, was always like pouring cold water\nover us, and telling us today they scream we will never give up, tomorrow they will\nscream heil Hitler. And he was right. And then came \u00b038, September, and we did give up.\nAnd from that time on -- my father did look into immigration. Our life didn\u2019t change until\n15\" of March, because my father still worked. I don\u2019t know how he felt, whether he felt\nany anti-Semitism, but we have seen changes in school. We still went to school, nothing\nchanged, and -- but some people weren\u2019t so friendly any more, and some people stayed\nfriendly. But it was a very uneasy -- the slogans were volt -- which rhymes in Czech, Volt\nnumber eight had again conquered noses, which meant the Jewish noses. The typical Jew\nhad a crooked nose, and so that\u2019s -- was always said, that\u2019s Jewish. And the situation\nchanged, you didn\u2019t feel so safe any more. And -- but in 15\" of March, the day I will\nnever forget, it was snowing, it was very raw. Where we lived -- we moved from that\n[indecipherable] other d -- apartment. Jews did not -- there were no condominiums, you\neither owned a house, or an apartment. Houses to own, rent -- to own big apartment\nhouses, you really had to be very rich, because you did not -- mortgages were not like\nyou buy a house today here in the United States. So we had a large apartment again, in --\non Benohuradi, which was a modern, and much nicer part of Prague, more green there.\nAnd I went to school there in my fifth grade, and then I had to walk downtown to school.\nWe didn\u2019t use public transportation, we walked to school and home. And it started -- I --\nacross from our house was a German school. And the German school was immediately\noccupied, 15\" of March by German soldiers. They came -- they -- at four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, the telephone rang in our house, and my father picked up the telephone, it was\nsomebody from the factory, I don\u2019t know who called, telling my father Hitler crossed the\nborder, Sudeten -- from Sudeten into Bohemia. Don\u2019t come to work any more. And that\nwas the end of his work, 15\u2018 of March. And when we woke up, the school was occupied\nacross the street, and I saw the Hackenkreuz fa -- flags hung, and the German soldiers\nstanding guard from my windows. And it was snowing, it was very cold and raw, and we\ndidn\u2019t go to school that day.",
        "Q: What kind of flags did you see?",
        "A: The German flags --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- with the --",
        "Q: The swastika.",
        "A: The swastika. And we stayed at the house all day. Also my parents decided to let the\nmaid go from now on, because my father was without a job. So that was the whole\nchange of our life.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something? Your father 1s working in a Jewish business --",
        "A: Not a Jewish business, this was a regular business, J-just a board of directors were Jewish.",
        "Q: Were Jewish.",
        "A: But they were gone from that day on, too.",
        "Q: I see. So it was so fast nothing -- they just --",
        "A: Maybe some of them are already left, I couldn\u2019t tell you --",
        "Q: Yes -- yes.",
        "A: -- before, you know, and some other people bought the sto -- stocks or things. I don\u2019t\nknow the financial --",
        "Q: But they clearly knew what they were going to do, as soon as Hitler came in.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because they wanted to please the Germans right away, there\u2019s no Jew working here.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was immediate.",
        "Q: So this is --",
        "A: And a non-Jew stepped into my father\u2019s position immediately.",
        "Q: Really? So this is extremely shocking, this is not a development --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether my father expected it or not. We didn\u2019t, we kids didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t\nknow what was happening from \u00b038 in the job with my father. But I know that we were --\nmy father tried to get out in a way. I don\u2019t know what all this happened. Cause we found\na letter that a friend of his from Palestine had a job for him. And I know that my brother\ntook some Hebrew lessons, which, I didn\u2019t know why. You know, we kids were not told\nanything. We were not told when somebody was sick. As a matter of fact I could never\nforget that my parents never told me when my beloved grandpa died. I just found out\nwhen I came to visit grandma and grandpa was gone. We were never told anything. They\ndidn\u2019t tell us what the financial situation is, what --cause we lived -- we -- we didn\u2019t f -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel we don\u2019t money or something, you know, afterwards. We lived in the same\napartment. We didn\u2019t have to move. We had to give up -- later on we had to give up a\nroom that was among the Jews and Jewish community to -- people lost apartments,\nbecause if they lived in a certain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to\nhave it clean of Jews, and they moved out. Somebody else had to take them in. We took\nin two women that were refugees from Austria, two old women, they were only in their\n60\u2019s. To me they seemed ancient. And then we had a -- when they were deported away,\nwhich was interesting, Mother told me later, they had poison [indecipherable] and they\nsaid Hitler will not get them. But they said they -- they were going to Lodz -- they went\nin the first five transports -- they said we will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we\nwon\u2019t do it, because you have kids. So when you asked about the suicides, the German\nJews had -- some had poison [indecipherable] and the Austrian. We did not, the Czechs,\ndidn\u2019t think about that ever. And then we had another Austrian family, a man and a wife,\nbecause when they left, we had to take somebody else. That was not the German decision\nthat the apartment was too big for a family. And a friend of mine lived with us, too. It\nwas the decision of the Jewish community, agreement. You know, they -- they had to\ntake care of them -- their own people, nobody else would. And I think everyone complied\ngladly, we didn\u2019t need that much room.",
        "Q: So these two women who told your mother they had poison --",

        "A: They left us a legacy, they used to own in -- in Vienna, a like bread and breakfast, or\nsomething, a pensionnat they call it, pensionne. And they had a cookbook from 1906, I\nstill have that coo -- cookbook.",
        "Q: Really?",

        "A: You don\u2019t know, because the day Hitler came, you did go out that day, my mother went\nto the bank, wanted to take out her safe. And they wouldn\u2019t let her, the Czechs said no.\nThe safe was gone. All what she had in the safe was gone. I don\u2019t know what my parents\nhad in the safe. When, after the war I went there, because I knew -- I used to go with my\nmother, I knew the number, and I knew the safe. I went there, and the Czechs said the\nGermans took it all. And when we applied for, in Germany for German [indecipherable]\nwrote about it, they said, \u201cGive us a proof that the Germans took it out of Czech Republic\n-- of Czechoslovakia.\u201d So, that was gone. And the money was put immediately under --\nconfiscated. Your savings, and your money. But every month you were allowed to take\nout certain amount, so that I think that\u2019s how we lived afterwards. And then I worked -- I\nhad to do something, so my -- I couldn\u2019t go to school.

And I had to do\nsomething, so I was working as a apprentice for s -- I hated every minute of it. I hated\nsewing, but as a reward, my father bought me a new sewing machine, so that -- maybe\nthat will interest me in it. That\u2019s the same, except it started much later with me, where\nthey felt a girl has to have a -- something, if she needs to earn money, and -- because they\ndid think we will get out. Mother had some relative in Chile, and we were supposed to\ngo, but we kids were deadly against it, we didn\u2019t want. The same way I was in the\nkindertransport, because I wasn\u2019t 16 yet at that time. My brother was 16, he couldn\u2019t go,\nand I threw such a tantrum that I won\u2019t go alone.

        "A: I was spoiled in food. I didn\u2019t eat anything. I was always very skinny, and my parent\nthought I was sick because I couldn\u2019t gain weight.

My mother tried, and tr -- I wouldn\u2019t. But when I went to camp by myself, I\npromised her I will eat everything. And that stayed with me, and I\u2019Il tell you a funny\nstory about it when we get to that. I was very choosy. So m -- I would get paid extra\nmoney if I put whipped cream on my dessert, or if I will eat another piece of cake, or --\nso I earned money extra.",
        "Q: But what ha -- what happens after the occupation, and your father loses his job, but\nyou\u2019re not quite sure what\u2019s happening --",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have such special foods, we had mostly -- first of all, after all the\nrestrictions, my mother had access removed from -- because there was a -- one store very\nnear us of [indecipherable] where my father -- and my father was loved by a lot of the\nemployees. He was very good with them. There was a young woman there who loved\nhim too, and her boss, you know? So she would give Mother out more -- more of\nnoodles, and more of flour, or things like that, without tickets. Because Jews had different\ntickets, and my mo -- rations, and my mother could go shopping only between three and\nfive. And I don\u2019t remember if it was every day or three times a week, Monday,\nWednesday, Friday. I don\u2019t know how, because I never went shopping, because Mother\nwou -- did all the shopping. So we didn\u2019t -- we had some friends would bring an onion,\nJews were not allowed to have vegetables, onions. There was a funny story. Fish we were\nnot allowed to have, and my mother got from somebody a carp, and if you know about\nHeidricks [indecipherable] of hi -- the assassination of Heidrick? That day, somebody\ngave Mother a carp, and she put it in the bathtub to have it for weekend. Tha -- this is\n[indecipherable] she was on [indecipherable]. And that night Germans came to the house\nto search, to our house. And when they banged down on the door, we woke up, and my\nfather right away knew it\u2019s German, my mother threw dirty wash into the bathtub, so they\ndidn\u2019t see the carp. But of course the carp died. So we had to have it the next day -- the\nnext -- the same day. They were looking if we don\u2019t hide the assassins. I mean -- you\nknow, they just wanted to make the Jews afraid, which they succeeded.",
        "Q: Right. Well, so -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk a little bit more specifically. There\u2019s a -- there\u2019s a\nseries of restrictions that --",

        "A: I tried to remember all of them, because I think I was in -- at that time ba -- home. Of\ncourse, the first was to wear the Jewish star, and -- because I considered myself looking\nJewish, I would be afraid not to. You had to have it on your coat, and underneath. You\ngot -- at the Jewish community you got a sheet of stars, you cut them out, and you had to\nhave it sewn on, not with pins, so that you can\u2019t take it easily on and off. And that\u2019s the\none I have sewn by my mother, still on her dress. And --",
        "Q: Does that mean if you took off your coat --",
        "A: It had to be underneath.",
        "Q: It had to be -- yes, I see. So it always had to be visible, and it was on the left side?",
        "A: Always it did, on the left side. Then came when schools were forbidden, any schooling\nfor the children. And in the beginning I still got some schooling, a teacher -- a Jewish\nteacher after work, we could go and read something, books or -- she had some books\nfrom history, so I would go in, she talked about history. It really wasn\u2019t schooling, we\nwere just -- they thought to work the brain little bit. And I don\u2019t know whether my\nparents paid for it, what it was, but I went with my friend to this s -- but second thing was\nthat Jews have a -- eight o\u2019clock you have to be home. Jews were not allowed to be on\nthe streets from eight to five unless they had a special permit. Jews had -- there was from\nthe beginning, eight o\u2019clock was Sperre, we called. And my father, being very concerned,\nwe kids had to be home 7:30. And I always said, \u201cYou are worse -- Hitler gives us eight,\nyou give us 7:30.\u201d We were rebelling against that, but there was no way, so our friends to\n-- we went ho -- they walked us home and then they went home, because they could be\neight o\u2019clock, we were the only ones -- my brother and me, we had to be home 7:30. You\nhave to understand, by this time we are teenagers, so we want to be out little later. We\ncouldn\u2019t. That was the next thing. Then came that we were not allowed to go through\npark. So when I went downtown, or walking, we had to go around the parks. Nothing\nwhere green grew, you could go around. Then we were not allowed to go to the main\nsquares. To the [indecipherable] like [indecipherable] squares, the old squares, you had to\ngo around, on the out squares. Then came you couldn\u2019t go in the street car, only the last\ntrain, the last platform. And if it was full, 1t was your bad luck, you couldn\u2019t get on,\ncouldn\u2019t get on, wait for the next one. We couldn\u2019t go to any coffeehouses, because the\nCzechs were -- even the young one used to be -- would go for a coffee or dessert in the\nafternoon, walking, and then sit down for a coffee. That was fibil, no coffeehouses at all,\nno movies, no theater, no concerts, nothing. So what we did, like young people, we met\nin -- every Saturday and Sunday with a group, in somebody else\u2019s house. And what was\nhappening, these groups became very close. You couldn\u2019t bring a friend unless everyone\nagreed. It was like a social club, you know, because you couldn\u2019t have it grow big,\nbecause only few people could come to the house, cause if it was too many it was seen by\nothers and it could be considered that we are planning something against the Germans, or\n-- so the groups had to be very small. I was in a very nice group and I have pictures when\nwe put up plays and we put up plays with -- with our friend Rhode, and then we showed\nit to the parents, so we had something to do in the afternoon. At 7:30 I had to be home. It\nwas only for the afternoon.",
        "Q: So it was set -- 1t was eight o\u2019clock, but for you 7:30, seven nights a week.",
        "A: 7:30, seven nights a week, 7:30 I had to be home. When we were young it was seven, and\nthen it ca -- became 7:30.",
        "Q: 7:30, so it was a little better.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s the --",
        "A: And that was dinner, and we had to be together. Meals were always together.",
        "Q: Always together.",
        "A: And there was no excuse from meals. We had to be together, and if something was\nconflicting with it, we had to give it up, because my father wanted to see us.",
        "Q: So you couldn\u2019t be invited to dinner to someone else\u2019s house?",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you ever invite people for dinner at your house?",
        "A: My parents did, but not my friends.",
        "Q: But not your friends.",
        "A: N-No. My parents had their friends. And when we were little we couldn\u2019t have dinner\nwith them, when we were bigger, we could sit with them.",
        "Q: But be quiet.",
        "A: Be quiet.",
        "Q: What sort of plays?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even remember --",
        "Q: Did -- do you remember",
        "A: -- [have some pictures from it, and I don\u2019t even remember what they were.",
        "Q: Were you acting?",
        "A: But -- we were acting. Our friend who died in Terezin afterwards, very early, was the\nfirst one we lost, which was such a shock to us, he was 21, in 1943. And he was very\nintelligent, and very bright, an intellectual, and he wrote them, and he was so the -- the\ndirector, and he choosed who was doing what. And that was fun to do because we had\nnothing to do the afternoon. We would play, like we had a -- a record player, we would\nplay music, we would do little dancing, but you had to be careful not to make noise so the\nneighbors don\u2019t hear. You know, we had nothing to do much in the afternoons, except be\nin the apartment. Next week we went in somebody else. So we tried -- so he tried to do,\nand then we had rehearsals for months, and months, and months. And then one\nproduction the parents would come and watch us do it, which was so childish I think\ntoday, but we didn\u2019t think so at that time.",
        "Q: Why were you meeting each other on Saturday and Sundays? Since you had no -- cause\nyou were working during the day?",
        "A: Because during the week we were working --",
        "Q: You were working.",
        "A: -- that was our free afternoon.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And what would we do, you can\u2019t go anywhere. You couldn\u2019t even sit in a park. You\ncouldn\u2019t walk the streets, you couldn\u2019t go shopping, you couldn\u2019t do anything. I\nremember when we knew this will be forbidden, and we have to wear the star, with a\nfriend I went to see this -- the castle, and go through the church there, which was such a\nfamous part of Czech history, because we knew we won\u2019t be able to do it any more. We\ncouldn\u2019t go to a museum, we couldn\u2019t go to a church, to -- you know, one thing what we\ndid too, which was interesting when you talk about concerts, we went to church to s --\nhear the mass, Bach, and all that as kids. In the church were the concerts Sunday\nmorning, we went to the church and listened. Music was very big part of our life, and I\ndidn\u2019t give it to my kids here as much. [indecipherable] kids, you don\u2019t take them to\nconcerts.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",

        "A: I don\u2019t know how our parents made us interested, what -- I don\u2019t remember when they\nstarted us. So that I forgot, that we went to churches, all that was forbidden.\n[indecipherable] were closed. You know, nothing was working, so we met in the houses,\nthat was the only --",
        "Q: What was your mood? This is a very depressing, oppr -- oppressive situation. Everything\nIS --",
        "A: We were very optimistic, even my fa --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- my father had a short wave radio. And Father listened to BBC, and to Voice of\nAmerica, and to -- mostly the British one they had.",
        "Q: BBC?",
        "A: Yeah. And he would watch what the war is doing, and he was very optimistic. Then we\nhad to give up the radio. Bicycles had to be given -- my brother owned a bicycle, I never\ndid because my mother wouldn\u2019t let me ride a bike, I would have muscles on my legs,\nlegs should be nice and smooth. So my brother, to give up his bicycle, what he did 1s he\nlet out the air from the -- from the bike, and walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and\neverything because he says he\u2019s not going to give it in a good condition to the Germans.\nAnd the radio we didn\u2019t give up either. From this non-Jewish friend, the father came and\nswitched the radio, he had a very ordinary radio, where he could catch only one station.\nAnd my father gave him the short wave radio, and then he would come and tell my father\nwhat\u2019s happening at night, slip in under darkness. So the ordinary radio, the Germans did\nget. So you didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- were not allowed to have a telephone. All my life I -- we\nhad a telephone, my father had, and we were not allowed to have it afterward. So they\u2019d\nstripped us of everything, and every time we thought it\u2019s the last thing. And another thing\nwhat the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some laws came up against\nthe Jews. So when Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were\nthinking, what will come this time? What will they take away this time? The jewelry?\nThis is my mother\u2019s ring. She always wore it so I never got another one from Edgar. So\nthat\u2019s her -- I don\u2019t know whether it was her mother\u2019s or whether my father gave it to her.\nBut when I had it checked, they said it\u2019s 1900 cut. That she hid for me. But you know, it\ncame slow. All these people say why didn\u2019t you ever -- weapons -- first thing was\nweapons. My father had his sword, cause he was in the Austrian army, and had a revolver\n-- had a -- a handgun at home. So he had to give that up, that was the very first thing. So\nthey stripped you slowly of all your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave,\nyou had no rights at all. And you -- if you didn\u2019t step -- when the SS man walked on the\npavement, when -- we had to step down into the gutter, whatever. We were not allowed\nto be in the pavement when the SS walked by.",
        "Q: And how did the Gentile Czechs treat you?",
        "A: Once Hitler came, except for one friend, all dropped me like dead wood. One stayed\nfaithful, I\u2019m still with -- friends with her. She\u2019s the one gave me everything, she\u2019s the one\nwith the radio, and the first thing she said to me, \u201cI have your father\u2019s radio.\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want it, he gave it to your father, and you were so good to me, keep it.\u201d She still has\nit. But the others dropped us, wouldn\u2019t talk to us, would turn away.",
        "Q: So they never said anything, they simply stared?",
        "A: No, they just dropped us. They were afraid to be seen with us. I [indecipherable] and they\n[indecipherable]. But this friend still came to visit.",
        "Q: Did that anger you or hurt you, or did you understand that they were afraid, and --",

We got in touch and the four of us that\nwere very close in the gimnasium, met. This was soon after the war, very early the\nsummer of \u201945. And I was devastated, I lost my parents. I had -- didn\u2019t know what I will\nlive off, I didn\u2019t have a profession. I wasn\u2019t that young that, you know, today you think\nthey are grown-up at that age, I was really immature for that. And I didn\u2019t know where I\nwill be tomorrow, and I had no roof over my head. And we met, and we went into\ncoffeehouse for coffee. And they talked about boys and dances, and dresses, and I don\u2019t\nknow what. And they were not interested in me at all, and I had nothing to contribute to\nthe conversation. We said good-byes, and I never saw them again [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So they never asked you what happened. They didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No. When you wanted to say something you were told, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, that\u2019s gone,\nwe survived, it\u2019s finished. Don\u2019t think about it at all.\u201d So that was the end. I don\u2019t know\nwhere they are, or whether they live, or nothing, e-except that one friend that I kept.",
        "Q: So you -- you\u2019re saying that you remained optimistic, in spite of all of this --",
        "A: Always optimistic in spite -- my father was so optimistic. I don\u2019t know whether he did it\nfor us, or whether he was -- first of all, he thought Hitler won\u2019t do to the Czech Jews\nwhat he did to the German Jews. And we always felt we are different. We are -- we are\nnot like the Polish Jews that wore -- you know, the Hassidic. We were dressed normally.\nThey always considered themselves different. And then we thought, he can\u2019t do, we are a\nprotectorate, we are not Germany, he won\u2019t do the same thing. And once -- special in\n1941, when America went into war after Pearl Harbor, we celebrated, this is the end of\nthe war. People said the next day will be end of the war, the America will just bomb\nGermany, and that will be the end. The Germans won\u2019t get up any more. It didn\u2019t work\nthat way.",

And then in \u201941 in November, when -- they\nopened Terezin, a lot of friends went. And my boyfriend went, and that\u2019s a funny story\nabout too, cause that\u2019s wa -- how I got to Terezin by myself. And that started, and my\nfather had me to be always ready on time. Start -- my mother started to preparing for\ndeportation. We had our 50 [indecipherable] everyone had what -- what we didn\u2019t wear,\nwhat do you take with us. My mother wanted everything to be like so, in condition like\nnew, so we wore the other things. My mother would e-eggs were a very hard com -- well,\nyou know, commodity. Jews were not allowed to -- we didn\u2019t have it in rations, but my\nmother got some on black market from that lady that was her savior, and she would dry\negg whites, use only the yolks, here and there, and if you mix the dried egg whites with\nwater, you had eggs, you know, egg white. So sh -- and that didn\u2019t weigh much, so we\ngot all a bag prepared of egg whites to take with us, and she would bake gim --",
        "Q: How do you da -- how do you dry eggs?",
        "A: On a plate, and -- and she let it dry until it got hard like crystal.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And she would bake special gingerbread that was very hard, but could all -- never got\nmoldy. She made for us what we called a studenmix, almonds, nuts, raisins that she still\nhad, and if she had a -- something to put in [indecipherable] and that -- that\n[indecipherable] and that she made a bi -- see, this is all the food that [indecipherable]\ntook with us, or we wouldn\u2019t touch it any more since *41, that was prepared for\ndeportation.",
        "Q: So you were always ready to go?",
        "A: My father -- I don\u2019t think other people did it, but my father had to be ready. And my\nfather made another thing, he handy with wood, he made mirrors for each of us, and put\nmoney in it. And these mirrors we took with us.",
        "Q: So that there was a wooden backing --",
        "A: Wooden back and a -- and a mirror, and in between was a hollow, and there he put the\nmoney. They took it each to th -- Auschwitz, and I had mine to the end, and my brother\ntook it to Auschwitz, and I had mine till the end, but when I took it out, marks were\nnothing, just a piece of paper, because they were German marks, and --",
        "Q: And it was worthless. When -- when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, did that make\nyou nervous, or you still thought someone\u2019s gonna come in and --",
        "A: We -- we still thought that the British --",
        "Q: I mean Poland, not the Soviet Union",
        "A: -- then German, that was the beginning of the war.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: We knew one thing, that Hitler will not give up Czechoslovakia unless there is a war, we\nwanted that war.",
        "Q: Yeah, I see. So you needed something, because it was the only way to get a --",
        "A: And the same thing happened to me when -- the Communists, who I never believed that\nCommunists will fall without a war. I said, there has to be a third World War to get the\nRussian Soviets down. Because that\u2019s what we believed, the Germans will not give up on\ntheir own. They will never move back. But of course, we saw Britain will coming, and\nwe -- the biggest depression I think what happened was when France fell. Poland, let\nthem take care -- Russia will take care of it. But when France fell, that was very\ndepressing, cause we thought they will move forward. And then they did the same thing\nin World War I, and the Czechs were saying French are good lovers, but lousy soldiers.\nThey give up, you know? But then the Czechs gave up too, finally. And the biggest\nexcitement was when there was invasion, when we thought that\u2019s the end of the war right\nthen and there, that the Americans --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- will -- will walk through Germany. Didn\u2019t think Germans are that strong, still --",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: -- to put up the fight me -- but I think we just closed our eyes.",
        "Q: Right. So you really didn\u2019t have a sense of what the conditions of all these countries\nwere. What the economic --",
        "A: Not the condition, not the condition. We thought they are strong --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and they will take care of Germany. And we thought Germany -- Germans are weak.\nWe thought they don\u2019t have reserves. They had -- didn\u2019t have oil, they didn\u2019t have rubber\nfor the wheels. I didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t have anything, but they made what they had.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They could recycle, which, you know, kept them -- and the worst thing was that from the\nJewish money, and gold, and art, they supported the war. The -- the -- the Jews paid for\nthe war.",
        "Q: From what they confiscated.",
        "A: What they took from the Jews, they paid for the war.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They had the money, the Jews in Switzerland, they supported them. But you didn\u2019t know\nthat time, but the Jews supported the war. And we thought they were run out of material,\nthey wouldn\u2019t have enough to fight with.",
        "Q: So when they --",
        "A: My father had some connections in -- in -- in Terezin that he got news. What the\nmovement of the front is, he knew. But by that time he wasn\u2019t that optimistic, because the\ninterest -- the Altestenrat, I think he knew also what\u2019s happening, because he -- the things\nhe told me when we left, and I couldn\u2019t go with -- they did not want me to -- to volunteer,\nand I did, and it didn\u2019t help. But what he said is, \u201cWe had our life behind, we are old.\nYou have to survive. You have to do everything to survive. Don\u2019t worry about us.\u201d He\n[indecipherable] so he went to Russia. He didn\u2019t go to Russia, which I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Right. So he knew something.",
        "A: He knew.",
        "Q: He knew something. So between \u201939, when -- Germany attacks Poland. And then there\u2019s\na pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. And then they violate the pact, and they\nattack the Soviet Union.",
        "A: That was no surprise to us, because we didn\u2019t trust the Russians anyhow. They -- you\nknow, we ju -- when they made the pact with the Nazi -- the right and the left, they were\nmake a pact, that\u2019s just [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t think anybody believed that Stalin tells\nthe truth.",
        "Q: And were you hearing things about what was going on in Poland, before the beginning of\nTerezin?",
        "A: Yeah, we were, but you know, people always think things are exaggerated. And it\nhappened there, it is not happening here. Do you know how today people think, happens\nto the others, it won\u2019t happen to me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s what we thought. I think that was what we were hiding behind.",
        "Q: Now, did you know a lot of people who tried to leave, or actually left?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we knew people who tried to leave, we knew people who left. My aunt was\nsupposed to go. They had a f -- fo America, and they were supposed to go to Cuba\nbecause they had to wait, and she just wouldn\u2019t leave. They already had their tickets, and\neverything, and she wouldn\u2019t leave withou -- without us, you know, and my mother, and\nthey stayed, and it was -- well, they died. And we were supposed to leave for Chile, and\nthen I don\u2019t know why my parents decided not to. And my father didn\u2019t want to go to\nPalestine, that was open to us. I don\u2019t know what was happening around then, because\nnot much was shared. We -- more was shared with my brother, my brother knew more\nthan I did, because he was little older.",
        "Q: I was going to say, was it because he was a boy --",
        "A: And he was also longer with my parents, he went to Terezin with my friends, I went by\nmyself.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah. We have to take a break.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Hana, I want to go back a little before Terezin, just to get a couple of pieces of\ninformation. Did you have pets growing up?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you have?",
        "A: We used to have dogs, never cats. Birds, parakeets, turtles, y-you name it, we brought\nanimals in. Both my parents were big animal lovers. When we moved from the original\napartment where I was born, I don\u2019t think there were allowed dogs there, because we had\nto give up our dog. Was a big German Shepherd, and he went to a farm in Votice, to\nfriends. So we didn\u2019t have a dog, but we always had canaries. We had different birds. My\nfather loved birds, and they loved him, because he always brought them goodies, and\nthey would sing for him and not for us.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And w-we tried to get babies by pairing them, and had eggs, but that never happened.\nAnd we had to give it up when Jews were not allowed to have pets. But by that time you\ndidn\u2019t have -- thank God we didn\u2019t have a dog we had to give up.",
        "Q: So you gave up the bir -- and you gave -- did you give them away to people who took\ncare of them?",
        "A: Yes, my parents found somebody who -- because canaries were pretty expensive those\ndays for you know, not -- your dogs you got, any dog you could get free, but -- so I think\npeople gladly accepted it. People had pets like that, 1t was a pet that they didn\u2019t have to\nwalk or do.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t unusual for people to have birds?",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact my aunt, who came from Vienna came out from the train, I\nstill see her, with two cages in each a parakeet, these little green and blue, you know,\nyellow and blue parakeets. She had them until she had to give them up, too.",
        "Q: And do you think many of these animals ended up being killed, that they couldn\u2019t find\nanyone?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I think the Jews tried to find somebody who would take care, who would\nlove animals. I think you could find somebody. I don\u2019t know how they did it with cats\nand dogs, because we didn\u2019t have it, but I don\u2019t think we had any problem of giving it --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But it made you lose a friend, it\u2019s there, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Everything was a loss, whether it was the piano that I didn\u2019t care so much before, or\nwhether it was your jewelry that you got as a kid, and you know, the birthday present\nfrom your father. You didn\u2019t like to part with your things, so you didn\u2019t like to part with\nthe animals either.",
        "Q: Right. And tell me, your -- you talked about going out with friends, and --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But -- but did you have a social life, were you dating?",
        "A: Yes, we did. Within the parties usually you found a partner, and then you switched. I\nmean that going together wasn\u2019t very serious. It could become serious. And then in 1939\n-- \u00b040 -- I think in the winter of \u201940, I don\u2019t know, I met a boy. That time we were still\ngoing to Hagiboar, which was like a playground where you could run around, and do a\nlittle sports. That was Jewish, so that was allowed to go to. And I met him there through\nanother friend of my friend. Since 1939, a girl lived with us. My very clo -- became a\nclose friend of mine. Her parents lived outside, and they wanted her to learn the\nprofession, so she was learning to sew in some other place than I did. And she lived with\nus and we shared a room, and ti -- tha -- used to go weekends to her parents\n[indecipherable] just fun. But then even that was forbidden because Jews couldn\u2019t travel\nby train at all. So then she couldn\u2019t visit her parents and met them only again in\nTheresienstadt, which they came from the village, she came from Prague. And her\nbrother also stayed in Prague, and lived with my aunt, who was around the corner, wasn\u2019t\nvery far. So within, you know the group you were, and you had one or two groups,\nbecause you met Saturday and Sunday with others. You paired up with a boyfriend. We\nwere -- when Hitler came I was 14, so by that time we started to be interested in boys,\nand we did, and I had a boy that we got engaged when we were 16 and a half, 17.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: My parents and his parents didn\u2019t say anything, and that was -- he put me later on on his\nlist as a family member, and that\u2019s how I ended up in Terezin.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s why I asked you.",
        "A: I had to go before my parents, and even though my father was devastated, so was my\nmother, and I was. I wasn\u2019t ready. You know, I wasn\u2019t -- today 18 year old girls go to\nschool, and they are ready to be on their own. We were not growing up that way. We\nwere never alone or going out at night because we never had those opportunities. And so\nwe were, I don\u2019t think, not that grown up yet. So for me going for the first time out of my\nhouse, not knowing -- I remember the last night, thinking will I ever sleep in my bed\nagain. And my friend was staying with my parents, 1t was me who had to go. And that\nwas really for everybody devastating. And my father tried to arrange and go and tell them\nthat they want to -- they did not want to volunteer because of my brother. They felt if\nthey -- as long as they can stay out, maybe the war will end, and we will f -- continue to\nlive our normal life. So they didn\u2019t volunteer, and I didn\u2019t want them to. So they tried if I\ncould wait for them, and they wouldn\u2019t do it, so I had to go.",
        "Q: So who -- whats -- was this boy\u2019s name?",
        "A: In Czech it\u2019s Honza, it\u2019s John, and his last name was Kosepak.",
        "Q: So you have this funny engagement, and --",
        "A: Not funny, we really thought --",
        "Q: -- you were Serious [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- we were li -- we were serious, we -- we thought --",
        "Q: -- but the parents obviously --",
        "A: -- the parents I don\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t -- were not against it, we knew -- both families\nknew each other, and f -- was nice Jewish boy. They were not against it, and they knew\nthe war is here, and people get engaged earlier, or even marry. We didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t\nintend to get married or anything. And so we just got engaged.",
        "Q: Did he give you a ring?",
        "A: He did, and I still have the rest of it. It was only silver with a blue aquamarine stone. The\nstone is lost, the ring is broken, but I keep the rest of it as a remembrance because that\none I smuggled, that one I gi -- didn\u2019t give up.",
        "Q: So that was when you were 16 and a half, now you\u2019re --",
        "A: 17 something.",
        "Q: -- 17. Now you\u2019re 19, so you -- were you actually going together for a couple of years?",
        "A: Yes, we were --",
        "Q: So you were --",
        "A: -- not 19, I w -- he went with the second transport, he was just in --",
        "Q: In \u00b040 -- in 1940? Or 41?",
        "A: 1941, with the second men transport, Edgar went with the first one --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- he was with the Akar, too, which was November \u00b041. He just became 18, and I was 18\nSeptember.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we met again when IJ arrived in July 42.",
        "Q: Now you just mentioned something that I think is important. Akar one and Akar two.",
        "A: Aufbaukommando.",
        "Q: And can you explain what that means?",
        "A: The first ones, because they were supposed to build Terezin, were called\nAufbaukommando one. That was the 340 something that Edgar went with.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: After that went another thousand men, only men, and it was called Akar two,\nAufbaukommando number two.",
        "Q: And do these become privileged --",
        "A: They were -- were privileged one degree below the Akar one.",
        "Q: I see. And then everyone who comes after, it\u2019s not Akar --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s already, it --",
        "Q: It -- it\u2019s gone, y --",
        "A: -- first started with, I think Edgar\u2019s transport -- parents were M. I was already in triple\ndigit transport, AAR647 was my number.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My parents were already in CC alphabet. The whole AAA, and the BBBB alphabet.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they came at CC [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But it\u2019s only the Akar one and Akar two that become [indecipherable]",
        "A: Two that they\u2019re aristocrastic. We call them aristocrastic.",
        "Q: Aris -- aristocrastic. Now when y -- when John -- John?",
        "A: Well, Honza we called him",
        "Q: Honza --",
        "A: Hanush in Czech.",
        "Q: -- went, was that shocking to you?",
        "A: To both of us. We didn\u2019t -- we had fun together, we enjoyed each other company --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t want to separate. But he said to separate from his parents, too, his parents\ndidn\u2019t go.",
        "Q: So he didn\u2019t volunteer for that transport?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Did he tell you he was going to try and get you to -- to come --",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- trying to get you on the list?",
        "A: -- but I think they enticed them, they said if you put them -- these two transports were\nsupposed to be kept in Terezin, they were like privileged, they didn\u2019t think -- and, you\nknow, like Edgar they send him with the last transports, it wasn\u2019t in any other. And they\nsaid if you put your family members on your list, they will be also privileged. So I think\nthat\u2019s why he did that. He didn\u2019t mean to get me into -- but that\u2019s how Edgar\u2019s parents\ntoo, because they were on his list as parents, came in early.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: So what happens, you get a notice through the mail, or it\u2019s delivered to you? What -- how\n-- do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how that was delivered, but I got a notice on that and that day, to be at the\npalace with 50 kilos, which is 110 pounds, what is allowed to take, and that\u2019s it, you go.\nMy brother went in the streetcar with me, you had to carry the 50 pounds yours -- kilo --\nyourself, up to where you had to register. What you had was a backpack, a roll where you\nhad your pillow, your linen, and you put in some food or anything. We call it bedrollup --\nbedroll, and the trunk. So somehow I got from my boyfriend -- fianc\u00e9, whatever you want\nto call it, a notice through his parents that I should make a white rectangle around my\nname because he will save my luggage, because the luggage was confiscated usually, and\nyou ended up only with the backpack and the roll. Not the first transport, only when -- in\n\"42, so Edgar doesn\u2019t even know about it. So, you know, we had to put Sarah in our\nname, every woman was Sarah, and every man was Israel, to degrade us more. We didn\u2019t\n-- we used to say we are privileged, because Churchill\u2019s daughter is named s -- Sarah. So\nwe very proudly carried that. I was Hana Sarah Fuchsova. So -- or German Fuchs. So we\ndid it, and he did save my luggage, and he saved the same way my parent\u2019s luggage. He\nworked at that time at the transports, and he kept his job to help people.",
        "Q: So a -- in this early stages, they -- you were able to get some messages from Terezin once",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he did do that.",
        "Q: He did it.",
        "A: Well, you know, there were nine boys hanged for letter writing in Terezin in January \u201942.",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s very well known.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- because they wrote letters and they were -- and they were caught, so they were\nexecuted. Edgar can tell you about it, he was there when that happened, we --",
        "Q: This is before --",
        "A: And we knew about it in Prague because that was made sure every Jew knows it. The\nGermans made sure, so that they don\u2019t write letters. But through some of the gendarmes\nevidently, he succeeded, give them something, and he smuggled a letter to his parents,\nand his parents told us.",
        "Q: When you\u2019re going to be dropped off by your brother --",
        "A: My brother wouldn\u2019t go out of that streetcar, he promised my father he wouldn\u2019t because\nhe was afraid they can pick him off the street, and bri -- if there 1s a [indecipherable]\ncompany. So he was in the streetcar with me at the back, cause we had -- as we were\npassing, I saw my father standing on the corner, he wanted a last glimpse of me. Crying.\nAnd then he just had to go another station, my brother, and then he returned home. And I\nhad to walk up the street to the entrance by myself.",
        "Q: And your mother stayed inside, by herself.",
        "A: My mother stayed home.",
        "Q: Were you crying on the train, do you remember?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well we were, I think three days or four days it took, till they processed the thousand\npeople. Register. And I don\u2019t think they even weigh our luggage, you could have had\nmore, but nobody dared.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: | --",
        "Q: Were you in a cattle car?",
        "A: No. Until we went -- this is with a streetcar.",
        "Q: The streetcar, right, is the normal streetcar?",
        "A: Yeah. I-In T-Terezin we were in a cattle car.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But that didn\u2019t take three days, that was in one day, although it took very long, for it\u2019s\nonly 60 miles. We arrived somewhere afternoon, three o\u2019clock in Terezin from they\nstarted to load at five in the morning, so --",
        "Q: So you were waiting in Prague to leave for three days?",
        "A: In Prague for processing took at least three days.",
        "Q: Three days.",
        "A: Because I arrived on the 16\" of July in -- in Terezin.",

        "A: -- | think it was.",
        "Q: When you\u2019re waiting in Prague, and you\u2019re going with your brother on it -- on the street,\nwhat\u2019s your biggest fear? Do y -- do you know, or is it very confused?",
        "A: I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m afraid to do this alone.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was scared, I had never been alone.",
        "Q: Alone.",
        "A: Either with my brother, or with my parents, and I have never been alone like that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To have to take care of myself, and that\u2019s when I promised my mother I will --",
        "Q: You'll eat.",
        "A: Eat everything, and they gave us this big portion of the watery -- brown water, which was\nsupposed to be coffee. So I promised Mother I\u2019Il finish everything I'll get. So I finished\nand drank it. My friend thought I like it, she gave me again. And I hated it, but I said I\nwill drink it because I promised my mother to eat everything.",
        "Q: Now, w-when you\u2019re waiting these there days, and there are a thousand people, are there\npeople that you know?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anybody, but you start talking to your neighbor -- and I had the same name\nbecause you are alphabetically put on the mattresses. And you try -- you walk around\ntrying to find somebody whether you know, and it\u2019s a long day. You wait, you get to --\nyou have to go to the table, you have to register. You have to give up your trunk. The\nbedroll and the rucksack you carry yourself. This is in July. I had a winter coat on, I had a\nsuit underneath. I had double -- double underwear. I had heavy shoes because you\nwouldn\u2019t take sandals. And I had to lug the luggage, and we walked from Bohusovice to\nTerezin, and some people fainted, and some people couldn\u2019t make it, it was very hot. I\ndid. And when we came into the -- they brought us to Hanover barracks. That was the\nSchleusse they called it, the accepting barracks. Didn\u2019t take long and my boyfriend was\nthere, telling me, I have your trunk. And I told him right away to tell my friend that I am\nhere, which he did. And he brought her over, he smuggled her in, because nobody was\nallowed to come near us. And they had to process us again. And her mother arranged that\nthey move me to Hamburger where they were staying. She took over like my mother, her\nmother, and she later on saved my life again. So when we came to register, I already had\na address where to go, I went straight to Hamburg, and then my friend said she\u2019s working\nat the mica production, where we peeled the mica. So she went immediately and signed\nme up for that. So the next day I went to work with her. So I had somebody there. And\nthen you start -- and then I tried to locate my grandma, who was there. My grandmother,\nsi -- about three weeks before me -- 15 -- or four weeks, 15\" of June she left Prague, my\ngrandmother. So then my boyfriend located her, and that\u2019s when I say Edgar is wrong, it\nwasn\u2019t yet opened the ghetto, he had to get me a false document, of another girl to -- so I\ncan go to visit her into that house. And I did, and I saw my grandma.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t allowed, you couldn\u2019t just walk around.",
        "A: Not yet, it was op -- and she died on 22\u2122 of August of that same year, and by that time it\nwas opened. But when I arrived --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- | couldn\u2019t move freely, any -- and the first thing she told me, she was so happy -- she\nwas blind, but she knew who I am, she was so happy to see -- see me. According to our --\nwhat we counted, she was 86. According to what they have in the files, she was born \u201954,\nnot 56 as we thought. So she might have been 88. As I say, she lasted about six weeks\nthere. Got sick, she died of dysentery. And the first thing she said, \u201cTell your father not to\ncome.\u201d She thought my father was a powerful man, can do anything, and he can say I am\nnot going, and he will not go. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible place here. Why did you come? He should\nhave taken care of you, you should not come here.\u201d I don\u2019t think she understood, you\nknow, the situation.",
        "Q: But she understood something.",
        "A: Oh, she understood that it\u2019s a bad place --",
        "Q: Bad place.",
        "A: -- but she didn\u2019t know --",
        "Q: What.",
        "A: -- that you have no choice.",
        "Q: Yeah. How did this w-w-woman, the -- the mother of your friend, and what -- what was\nher name, and -- and the -- the name of your friend, and the mother\u2019s name.",
        "A: Okay, my friend was named Eva, their name was Dittel.",
        "Q: Dittel?",
        "A: And I called her Mama Dittel afterwards. And she died in Munich at age 101 and a half.\nSo I saw her last time when we went there to celebrate her hundredth birthday.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And what she did for me, in September of \u201942, I was put in for deportation to Poland -- to\neast, nobody knew where. And she decided that\u2019s ridiculous, her parents are still in\nPrague. She went to [indecipherable] and put down the -- my application. She was OD,\nOrdnungsdienst, so she could do it. And said, \u201cThis girl is not 21 yet, her parents are in\nPrague, how can you send her alone?\u201d And put stamp, do not send. So I got out of the\ntransport, and I didn\u2019t realize somebody else must have gotten in because of me. That\ntime we didn\u2019t think that way.",
        "Q: Yeah, right, right. Now it\u2019s --",
        "A: That came only when the people started to ask are you guilty of -- yes, somebody else\nmust have gone, because thousand people had to go --",
        "Q: So they had to --",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s one transport where they have destination unknown. Nobody knows what\nhappened to the thousand people.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: That\u2019s the September transport to the east.",
        "Q: So the -- uh-huh. And --",
        "A: I found it only, you know, after we got the -- the memorial book from Prague, from the\nTerezin inshairtif. They collected a book of all the names and birthdays and where they\nwent and where people died. And all the transport that went ever to -- to Lodz, or to\nTerezin, and where they went further, and their -- this -- under that transport, destination\nunknown.",
        "Q: Hm. And they have the names of all the people who are on them? Oh, excuse me.",
        "A: Well, that is hard to find who -- they have the name of the transport, you would have to\ngo through all the people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, to find it.",
        "A: To find that there -- when you have your name there, it says where you were liberated,\nand where you died if they know it. If they don\u2019t know it, it\u2019s the transport where that\nwent where you died. Because many people went straight to Treblinka, so they don\u2019t\nhave the date or anything.",
        "Q: Right. And what was Mama Dittel\u2019s ti -- she was -- let\u2019s explain what that is, that --",
        "A: She was a real, very aggressive, in that case woman, she got the job, and she would -- OD\nmeans Ordnungsdienst, which meant she was responsible anywhere there was a line, to\nkeep order, and so if she kept order on -- in the line for people to go into the offices or\nsomething when they requested -- everywhere you waited in line. Whatever you wanted.\nIn -- you wanted a job or something, there was 50 people lined up for that, too. So they\nneeded these people who kept people not fighting, and to keep them in line.",
        "Q: Right. So she had --",
        "A: So she had such a kind of job, she was standing near the kettle so people don\u2019t fight for\nthe food when they were giving out food that was her job. And Eva and I worked\ntogether. We are s -- friends, we were friends from Prague already, she was one of the\ngroup. So we used to go to her house, to our house, you know, and to others, she was a\nmember of one of the groups that I was in.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she was there since January \u201942, they went early. And her father was there too at that\nti -- and I knew the whole family, my mother knew the whole family.",
        "Q: So the mother had a certain -- certain kind of position, which was why she could get you",
        "A: No, she was on the -- yeah, but she was also very aggressive, she could get it, you know,\nsomebody else wouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Somebody else wouldn\u2019t march into the office of the [indecipherable], she did.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she was accepted, people accepted her. She had a way with people.",
        "Q: And in -- in the same way she got you into the other barrack. Instead of being in\nHamburger you were in Hanover --",
        "A: Probably, I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- no, a -- the reverse, the reverse.",
        "A: No, that -- that was ten -- temporary anyhow. They would assign you where to go, they\nwould make a list wherever they had place, but if you had somebody, and wanted to be\ntogether with the family, and there was room, they would do it. I got my mother then, to\nbe with me in the room, too. We just put it on her list, you know, as a request. That -- the\n-- where to put people wasn\u2019t difficult to get --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- because they didn\u2019t care. If there wasn\u2019t room, I had to sleep on the floor between the -\n- on the corridor until there was room. There was constant movement. People moved\naround, they found a friend, they wanted to be put together, that was not so hard to do.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And transports went, so there were empty spaces --",
        "Q: Spaces.",
        "A: -- you when -- that was like a seniority. You started on the floor, and ended up where you\nwanted after awhile, when it got -- became available.",
        "Q: Soy --",
        "A: So in the end, Eva and I had a bunk together.",
        "Q: Together. And you were in Hanover?",
        "A: Hamburger.",
        "Q: Hamburger.",
        "A: Hamburger. Hanover where -- where we arrived.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And then -- then Hamburger became what they called Schleusse, for incoming and\noutgoing transport, but at mi -- sometimes it was a different barrack, whichever they\nemptied for it. When I came in \u201942, it was Hamburger, when my parents came, there were\nin a different -- Hanover -- when my parents came it was in a different [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Different place. And Schleusse means what?",
        "A: Schleusse is where the water goes through. People coming and going, and that\u2019s probably\nhow the -- they took it and was a expression I learned only in Terezin. In Czech it\u2019s\nSchoishka, so they took over the word, gave only a Czech ending. I-It means passing\nthrough, probably.",
        "Q: But this was also where they would confiscate the luggage, am I right? They would take\nit --",
        "A: The luggage never arrived there. The luggage was put on some carts that the people that\nworked in the transports schlepped, like my boyfriend, and they schlepped it directly to\nthe magazines or to the storage where they store them. This clothing original was only for\nGermans, that the Jews didn\u2019t get it, only until they opened the stores, did they share the\nclothing for those -- from those storerooms with the Jews. Because th-the Germans were\nbombed out, they lost everything. They needed clothing, so they took it from the Jews.",
        "Q: Right. And was your boyfriend -- was Honza taking a chance bringing you your luggage?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: He was, wasn\u2019t he?",
        "A: Yes, but he did it for his parents, and for my parents too.",
        "Q: So did you then take the luggage a -- I mean, put the clothes --",
        "A: He brought it after wa -- he kept it until I had a permanent place in the Hamburger.",
        "Q: I see. And where did you keep the luggage? Under the bed, or what did you do?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have a space under the bed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I lived on the upper --",
        "Q: Oh, you were on the upper? So then what did you do?",
        "A: -- upper bunk. There was a shelf and I put the trunk that was all where you had your\nclothes, you couldn\u2019t hang it, you couldn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So you kept it in the trunk, and the bedding you spread on your bed.",
        "Q: And where -- where would be this shelf? Near the -- near the --",
        "A: O-Our bunk was -- we had the top, the two of us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the shelf was going towards -- there was a window, and the shelf was going to the\nwindow. So on that shelf I had the trunk.",
        "Q: So someone had to lift up this fif --",
        "A: Yeah. The middle one had also a shelf, the bottom one had it underneath. But the trunks\nbecame my bed later on. The tr --",
        "Q: And I -- the trunk became your bed?",
        "A: Yeah. Three trunks made a bed on the -- on a trip with [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you -- excuse me, did you have a lock on this trunk? Were you concerned about\npeople stealing? No.",
        "A: No. I doubt it.",
        "Q: Okay. I think we should stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Hana, I want to ask you some details about the --",
        "A: Arrangement?",
        "Q: Arrangements, yes. So you\u2019re on the top bunk, although it takes you a little while to get\nto the top bunk. Is that when -- when you\u2019re in the top bunk, is that when Eva 1s up there\nas well?",
        "A: She was there already, and her partner, whatever -- whoever lived there, then moved out\nof -- I don\u2019t know where, was pretty fast, there was always a mor, or found a better, or\nfound somewhere else to live. When it emptied, and I was on the floor, a -- but nobody\nelse wanted it, I could get it. It went according to seniority. Each room we were about 40\nwomen in the room, and there was one woman who was called Zimmeralteste, which\nmeans the oldest of the room. And she was the one who made the decisions. So -- but she\nwas pretty good, she -- you know, honored some request, it didn\u2019t change anything for\nher. So it didn\u2019t matter if I was in the corridor, meanwhile, when my mother came she\nwas in the corridor. She couldn\u2019t climb up because she suffered from sciatica nerve,\notherwise I would have switched with her, but 1t couldn\u2019t. And then she got right away a\nbed because of that, so you know, she made those decisions, she also made sure\neverything is clean, that the room looks clean, because there were checks sometimes. And\n-- and I don\u2019t know by whom, but we were always expecting some inspections. And then\nshe also was the one that distributed the rations. You got a ration of bread. Sometimes\nyou got little bit of milk, which was like bluish water. And sometimes you got little bit of\nsugar, and margarine, those were the rations. So she got the whole thing, and she had to\ndivide it into 40, so there was enough, you got a big s -- soupspoon of sugar, if was more,\nyou got two. Bread was always the same, you got a piece of bread, that was for three\ndays. Being me, the first time I got the bread I ate it. In two days I didn\u2019t, so I learned\nvery fast that I marked how much bread I can eat every day. And that was only once that\nit happened that I ate it all. And I took little bit supply from what I had from mar. So, she\nwas the responsible person. She also decided if we had little bit of wood, when to heat up\nthe room or not, because there was only little stove, in that -- in -- for winter. So it was\npretty cold, but you had the blankets. You did have blankets. So we slept with Eva\nhuddled together under two blankets, we didn\u2019t need each a blanket. In summer it was\nmuch worse. The bedbugs were terrible, and we would take our mattresses and put it on\nthe corridor outside, in front of the room, along the -- you know how these windows are\nin Hamburger --",
        "Q: These round [indecipherable] windows, yes.",
        "A: -- barrack? Under the windows, and we slept outside, because it was too buggy, and too\nmuggy inside.",
        "Q: So it was buggier inside than outside?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what sort of a mattress was this, was this straw? Or was this a real --",
        "A: Yes, straw.",
        "Q: It was straw.",
        "A: Straw. I think that\u2019s what all the Czechs used. I think that\u2019s what was mostly they used,\nhorsehair mattresses in good times, but I think for us they -- it didn\u2019t matter, we slept. We\nwere So tired, we slept. The first -- I wasn\u2019t so tired from the mica peeling, or something,\nthat was sitting down. We had fun because we were -- that\u2019s where we made most of the\nfriendships, we were eight girls together. Course the young clung together and we were\nalso a very noisy table, because we were telling our th-things, and we were laughing and\nthings, and the old people didn\u2019t li -- the old people, they were in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s,\ndidn\u2019t like it, so they were always hushing us that nobody can hear when we are there.\nAnd all of us knew that this is a terrible job, dusty, sitting and peeling them, and we had\nto make a -- sort them, and make a certain amount a day. It wasn\u2019t just playing, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Wh-Wh -- what -- what --",
        "A: It\u2019s a-- it\u2019s a--",
        "Q: What is it?",
        "A: -- the mica you have to peel thin, they said it\u2019s for the airplane, and there was bigger\npieces, smaller pieces, and you had to sort them according to sizes.",
        "Q: And then you peel the --",
        "A: Peel it into thin, like if you would peel --",
        "Q: An onion?",
        "A: -- anything in layers.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So it -- there would be a number of layers on the mica --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and you would peel it off.",
        "A: You would peel it to the thinnest one and then the supervisor checked that there is not\nsomething wrong, no -- the sizes are all right, and -- because he was responsible to the\nGerman. So we all tried to get into a better job, and one of my friends with whom I\u2019m\nfriend to -- today, she lives in Los Vegas, she decided -- she had a boyfriend too, that\ntime. And who told her to get into agriculture. So she was the first one to leave the table,\nthe -- you know, the eight of us. Then two others went to agriculture, so I decided I\u2019m\ngoing too. And I went and apply for the job and they -- I said I come from a farm, my\ngrandpa was a farmer.",
        "Q: He was?",
        "A: So they asked me how potatoes grow, I had no idea, because I have never seen potatoes\ngrow. So I don\u2019t know where I got it, I said, \u201cLike onions, with the -- with the roots in the\nground.\u201d And they said, she knows, and I was in my -- in agriculture.",
        "Q: Now where would you -- fir-first of all let me ask you, why was it -- I-I -- one would\nthink that working inside would be better than working outside, but that was not the case\nthere?",
        "A: What did I have, I had nothing from working inside. I peeled mi -- for mica that I\ncouldn\u2019t do anything with. I breathe in the particles, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: There\u2019s a lot of --",
        "A: I wanted to get out.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: They told you get out into the fields, and you can eat the vegetable, so I got out.",
        "Q: So then where -- where do you go to apply for a job in this --",
        "A: There was a place where you -- the groups always gather, that was called Drusstvo, it was\nlike a collection place where they had offices. These were lot of people, and lot of fields\nthat had to be. They had cows -- they had horses, not cows, and they had pigs, and there\nhad to be organization, and there was a head of that, and then over him was the German\nhead, who was in the party but was not -- who was not a SS, was a civilian. He must have\nbeen member of the Nazi party, was a civilian. So there was a organization, so they had\nto meet in the offices and the -- the storerooms where we stored some of it, because we\ngrew all kinds of vegetable. So my friend started it, she knew where to go, she taught me,\nI went there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I got in. Which was in winter, which wasn\u2019t the best thing because we were in the\nfreezing cold all day. But you were outside, and you got out of the ghetto. My father, my\nmother never set foot out that since the day they came.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- behind the wall. I was out every day.",
        "Q: So did you --",
        "A: [indecipherable] group.",
        "Q: -- so you -- did you have a different sense of yourself, and was it --",
        "A: A different sense of jealousy. I saw people, I said people still live normally, how is that\npossible? They walk on the road, they went with the horses, we had to go to the side\nbecause we were marching in columns, with the gendarmes, two gendarmes with their\nrifles, so we don\u2019t run away, or don\u2019t pick up a fallen apple, drop the apple from the trees.\nAnd people were -- passed the SS -- we went along the river, and we passed the SS -- like\nfor swimming place, and they were there sitting and enjoying themselves with children.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t have a normal life. It was very -- we were\njealous, why do we have to be like this? Why couldn\u2019t we be like them?",
        "Q: So it was a conflicting -- a situation of conflict.",
        "A: Yeah, we -- we -- we talked about it, what we will do when we get free. You know, we --\nI remember saying I wish I was -- I cou -- I don\u2019t care how old I will be at the -- as soon\nas I can say it\u2019s 10 years after the war. It\u2019s -- you know, we wished for the impossible\nthat time.",
        "Q: Were you very hungry all the time?",
        "A: Not when I started to work in the agriculture, no I had the [indecipherable], I brought in\nthe vegetables, I smuggled them in my bra.",
        "Q: But this was very danger -- w-was someone -- a group called Berusky, s-something --",
        "A: Berusky yes, but I was the only person that never was examined by them or touched.\nWhen I went to work, they were there only at the j -- gate when I working on another\nplace. I was the good luck charm for my group. I had never been searched by them.",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: Never. And I went every day to work.",
        "Q: Now explain who Beruskys wa -- what the name --",
        "A: Those were women, SS German, that waited at the gate, that were allowed to frisk us.\nAnd of course, if they found something was the same like SS. So we were afraid of them.\nSometimes you had a good gendarme who would warn you, and some people were\ncaught.",
        "Q: Why do you think you were -- it\u2019s an --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I never lived it. I lived through one search. There was a big -- this was in\nsummer, June \u00b044. We called it afterwards, fashion show. What happened, they caught --\nthere were people who were transporting ashes out of the town from the kitchens, and\nfrom where they were heating in big -- I don\u2019t know, they were ashes. And un -- they --\nthey were stopped by some SS, and they found some lettuce. These people were\nimprisoned, and everybody who was on the field were -- had to stop working, and they\nhoarded us into one of the barracks, into one of those -- there were -- in the -- in the\nbastion or whatever that is, there were rooms, and there we had to -- they took four and\nfour wim -- girls in, and they had to strip totally, and the SS -- and we were stage --\nstanding naked in front of the SS, and th -- he checked whether you don\u2019t have anything.\nAnd then you dressed, and we didn\u2019t know what they will do with us, but they did let us\ngo. This took a whole day till everybody was frisked, till three or four, and we went\nhome. But while we there -- we were there, we didn\u2019t. But that was the only time I was\nfrisked like that. And because the gendarmes were there, and of course they knew us,\nthey were watching with us, we had to strip to be naked, we called it fashion show. And\nwe always said, \u201cOh, that one was in the -- at the fashion show.\u201d Because he was with us,\nso -- that was one time, but we still -- I don\u2019t think we were afraid that something will\nhappen to us, because we didn\u2019t have anything, whatever we had, we ate. A girl had a --\nsomething like a lettuce, so we ate it all. It -- it was just swallow a little wad of paper. My\nsister-in-law said they had to swallow something else, like piece of -- they had a crown,\nor the money on them, which was supposedly harder. She just told me now, I didn\u2019t know\nit. She was in -- my sister-in-law was with another group, she was there, too. So I wasn\u2019t\nsure which one, she says it was June \u00b044. Was hard to remember dates, you didn\u2019t have\ncalendars, so you didn\u2019t know exactly, but you knew when it\u2019s Sunday, and you knew\ndates, but to remember the dates, you don\u2019t. The one date I remember is -- did you ever\nhear about the census taking in Terezin?",
        "Q: From? Oh yes.",
        "A: November 11\", 1943?",
        "Q: Yes, tell us about it.",
        "A: Oh, we were the first barracks, because Hamburger is right on the edge of Terezin. So we\ngot the notice that everyone has to be counted, we didn\u2019t know how extensive it 1s, and\nwhat it means, but we had to line up in the courtyard at five in the morning. Because it\nwas November, some people took a blanket with them, which was very good, because it\nwas fr-freezing cold to stand there all day. We didn\u2019t know what they\u2019II do. And they\nmarched us into this place, which was not like a valley, but it was surrounded by little\nhigher, you know, not wall, the earth was like a division between fields, but it was higher,\nmuch higher, so -- there\u2019s a Czech word for it, like a small valley or something. And they\nmarched you by hundreds, always. And we came there, and we were one of the first ones,\nSo we were right on the edge. And they put the SS with machine guns on top of these\nthings, so we got little frightened what will be on -- they going to shoot us here? They\nsaid to count, somebody supposedly ran away, and there the count was off. And I never\nheard counting one by one. So I think it took nearly all morning till everybody got\nassembled there, or till 10 - 11, I have no idea. And then people started to walk around.\nMy brother lived me and my parents, but I was the only one -- by that time my father got\nthe room in one of the houses, and Mother and Father lived together, because he was also\nprivileged. And I still stayed in Hamburger, and my brother found with a friend in the\ncellar a room, and they made themselves in the cellar a -- a room for them. So he lived\nnear my parents, so they were together in the column, but I was again separated. So then\nmy f -- brother found me, and I went over to say hi to my parents, that I\u2019m okay, and\neverybody\u2019s there. But then you were afraid, because the Germans were walking by, and\nyou were not allowed to move. And when you have to go to the bathroom, luckily you\nhad the blanket, somebody put it around you. And they were counted, one by one every\ncolumn was counted. And it was getting dark, in -- in -- in November, it\u2019s not so long\ndaylight. And we decided to talk how nice it will be, I will kiss my bunk if I get home.\nWe didn\u2019t know whether we will be there all night. It was pretty upsetting. So by 11 at\nnight we got home. We were again the last ones, because we were the first ones coming\nin, some got earlier. The next day my father said that\u2019s it, the family has to be together,\nyou have to move in. So I moved in with my parents, I was very willing. I didn\u2019t like to\nbe separated. My brother was again with them, and I was in. My brother lived in the\nhouse next to them, so the whole block of houses went together, he was not separated. So\nthere was not room for another bed, so on the floor we put the trunks, and then we\nseparated them -- the door was blocked. And -- and when -- during the day we put them\nup like a seat. So that was the room I had there with my parents, in November \u00b043.",
        "Q: So -- well -- now let\u2019s go back. So you left the mica working, you\u2019re working the\nagriculture, you work six days a week or seven?",
        "A: Six days a week.",
        "Q: Six days a week.",
        "A: Not seven, no. There were days when we had to work on Sundays when there was\nharvest, and maybe it would rain and they wanted to get the hay in, or the -- the harvest\nwasn\u2019t, for the Germans, going fast enough. Those days we would, from early morning\ntill light was out, 10 o\u2019clock or so -- there were days. But regularly six days a week.",
        "Q: And what are you do -- doing? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well I have -- every group was different, and everybo-body -- I got into the group with\nmy friends because I wanted to be with them, with this girlfriend that I had. And I got in\nwhat they call the field group. And we were designated to take care of the tomato fields,\nwhich was near a village called Travcice, so that those fields were called that. And there\nwe went every day. We had to plant them, we had to tie them. Everything was done by\nhand. We had to clean all the weeds every time. We had to harvest them, we had to\nprepare the fields for next season. In between they had some kohlrabi or other vegetable,\nwe had to harvest that. And then if something was necessary, we had to plant other --\nother vegetable, there were fields. Spinach fields, there were beet -- beets. You know,\nanything that you are doing agriculture, there is always work to -- they would put the\nfield, and there was a Staabsgarten, which was -- they were the -- this was for the German\npopulation soldiers, or population. But there was a garden where they had vegetables\nonly for the SS, for the SS kitchen where they cooked for them, and for the whole SS\nsoldiers [indecipherable]. So my friend, the one that we went to school together, worked\nthere. And she went every day there to work. You know, everybody had different places.\nMy other two friends were -- their mother joined too in agriculture, and they worked on\nthe place where they -- so when I went to help out there, I had onions, I could bring home\nonions. You know, it\u2019s -- we stole anything we could, and we ate anything we could.",
        "Q: And did you usually eat it there?",
        "A: What we ate, I wouldn\u2019t touch a tomato at home, I ate tomatoes all day. That was all I ate\nall day, I mean, no bread, I wouldn\u2019t use the bread when I had tomatoes. [indecipherable]\nmy stomach was full of vegetable, and we -- when we were harvesting kohlrabi we would\n-- but we had to cover up the peels or anything, because we were not allowed to eat. And\nwe had a lookout, because Heindel, who was supervising us, SS, had the motorcycle, we\ncould hear him. The lookout will hear him, so we wouldn\u2019t eat, and we would work very\nhard when he came. And if hear -- saw somebody standing up, he gave us two hour more\nwork, the whole group. So we had a lookout. And the lookouts were on all fields, and we\nwhistled. We had a sign to whistle, then he forbid to whistle, so we were barking like a\ndog. I mean, we found always a way to -- to -- I -- I have to put my hand up.",
        "Q: To -- to s -- to signal people.",
        "A: Signal. And we had a lookout for that.",
        "Q: Were you getting f -- whatever normal food would be getting -- 1 -- people getting in the\nghetto during the day that you\u2019re working?",
        "A: Yes, we went home for lunch.",
        "Q: Oh, you went back to --",
        "A: We had to go home for lunch and come out again.",
        "Q: I see. So you would have whatever breakfast, if they had anything, in Terezin.",
        "A: We had -- breakfast was black coffee.",
        "Q: Black coffee.",
        "A: And we had a bread. We had a piece of bread.",
        "Q: So you would get bread for three days that you had to eat.",
        "A: Yeah, a certain, it was this -- about this big.",
        "Q: And where would you --",
        "A: Like a big loaf, and a fourth was the -- but then my brother worked in the bakery, so we\nhad more.",
        "Q: Where would you keep the bread?",
        "A: Except my mother wasn\u2019t a good -- we kept it outside, on a paper. My mother wasn\u2019t a --\nno [indecipherable] or anything, my mother was a giver. There lived a lot of old people in\nthe housing, she would share with them what I brought, [indecipherable] the bread, too.\nMy father wasn\u2019t allowed to know about it.",
        "Q: Now, wait a minute, but -- there\u2019s a period of time when you\u2019re working in the fields, and\nyour parents are not there. Am I correct? That you --",
        "A: No, my parents were there. By the winter of \u201943, my parents were there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So by the time you have the job --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in the agriculture --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- they\u2019re there. But you don\u2019t move in with them --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- fora --",
        "A: No, I stayed in the Hamburger. Mother was with the Hamburger. My father and my\nbrother were in Sudeten barrack.",
        "Q: Barracks.",
        "A: And after my father got established, and found his way around, and became member of\nthe imagdabolt, and after the housing was totally empty then, I mean available or\nwhatever, I don\u2019t know whether it was empty already.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He got the room for Mother and him. So that was little later, that was also around winter\nof 43. First they were in barracks two --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay, right. Now, when I -- when I asked you about where would you keep the\nbread, when you were living in the barrack, you weren\u2019t --",
        "A: You kept it up on top on your shelf.",
        "Q: On top?",
        "A: Nobody would steal it.",
        "Q: And what about the bugs? Did they eat it?",
        "A: The bugs don\u2019t eat bread, no, they eat your blood.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They suck your blood.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Bed -- bedbugs suck your blood [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Were there lice? Were there lice?",
        "A: Yes, there were lice, but luckily we didn\u2019t have it, that was our biggest concern if\nsomebody got lice, they shaved his head. Her head.",
        "Q: Or her. And nobody got lice in your group?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And how come?",
        "A: We were very careful. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where the lice were more prevalent, but nobody had in our room, in the\nbarracks. You tried to keep -- you washed your hair, tried to keep clean.",
        "Q: And you washed your hair with what?",
        "A: Cold water and soap.",
        "Q: You had some soap?",
        "A: I think we must have gotten - couldn\u2019t be there for three years that I was there, I brought\nenough soap with me.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yes.",
        "A: The soap was swimming. You know, that was not the regular soap. The war soap.",
        "Q: What do you mean it was swimming?",
        "A: It wouldn\u2019t sink.",
        "Q: It wou -- it was very light?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see. And did you have toothpaste?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Maybe in the beginning.",
        "Q: Did you brush your teeth?",
        "A: We did. We had to go to the dentist, but he couldn\u2019t do much. My teeth were -- I got my\nwisdom teeth there, and afterwards they had to be pulled, but we didn\u2019t have much dental\ncare, but there was a dentist, yes.",
        "Q: But the dental care was probably pulling teeth.",
        "A: Probably they had to. I don\u2019t know if they had Novocain even that time.",
        "Q: Yeah. Were there toilets there?",
        "A: Yes., and pretty near us was the toilet. We were the last room -- we were 191, and the last\none was 190, and opposite was the toilet, so we didn\u2019t have it far. I don\u2019t remember being\nany problem with long lines, because we went late at night, maybe and we didn\u2019t go at\nnight, and the early morning because we had to go to work. So I don\u2019t think we had such\na problem.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: There could be a line here and there you know, but --",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t remember that?",
        "A: There\u2019s always a line in ladies room, you know --",
        "Q: Yes, I know.",
        "A: -- that when you go somewhere, so that\u2019s about it, what we had too.",

        "Q: Behind a tree.",
        "A: There were no toilets.",
        "Q: No, I imagine there was no outdoor toilets, right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was this very tiring work for you, or because you were eating more, were you less tired\nthan you might have been?",
        "A: We were tired because we really worked hard, very, very hard, we were out on our feet\nall day --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with the hoe, we had to turn over the ground, we worked like men. But you know, you\nare not really hungry, but because you don\u2019t have it -- first of all, tomatoes, you full your\nstomach and in half an hour you are hungry again. And because you don\u2019t have it, if\nsomebody tells you can\u2019t have more in a day than this, then it\u2019s -- this is very small. So\nyou do feel hunger. And we talked a lot about food, but we also heard a lot of requiem.\nMy friend was singing in requiem, and while we were turning over the manure, she was\nsinging what she learned the night before.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that good for everybody that she was singing?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. We were singing songs with her. She had a beautiful voice, and we knew\nwhat\u2019s going on, and we were waiting for the production, and we all went to listen, and it\nwas so uplifting that I could never forget it.",
        "Q: And when you were talking -- well, we\u2019ll talk about that more, but when -- when you\nwere talking about food, you\u2019re all young women --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk what we cook, what we like to eat and what we would order, and what we\nwanted to eat.",
        "Q: I see, what other people would have cooked for you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything about cooking.",
        "Q: Was this --",
        "A: What dessert you like best, what ice cream you like best.",
        "Q: Is this --",
        "A: We always ate.",
        "Q: Did this make you hungry, or was this helpful?",
        "A: I think it was helpful, we tried to taste it in our minds.",
        "Q: Yeah, right. Now, did a --",
        "A: We were not really that starved. I can\u2019t say, because we did have something, but we\ndidn\u2019t see eggs for years, you know, so you were imagining how good eggs are. At one\npoint they decided that they will have silkworms on a f -- there. So four of us girls, and I\nwas among them, were responsible for the silkworms, we had to feed them. We had to go\nand look for mulberry trees, and a German was coming with us. We had to take all the\nmulberry leaves, put it in a bag, and then we came where they had the silkworms, and we\nfed them and cleaned out that. They were very nice, they were silky, the worms are very\nnice. And once it was in a farm, and the chicken lost her egg. Now we were four girls,\nand we were trying to get the egg. What we would do with one egg for the four of us, I\nhad no idea. But the -- the German saw it, and he picked it up, wouldn\u2019t let us pick it up,\nso we lost our egg. But th -- those were the things we were longing for that we didn\u2019t\nhave. We had the soup, and the black coffee and bread, normal meal. And sometimes the\ndumplings with [indecipherable] a treat. But you didn\u2019t have variety, you didn\u2019t -- so we -\n- we dreamt about that, we were hungry for that, but starving like they did in Poland or in\n-- in those camps, no.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You see, I would pull out the carrot and eat it with the earth and everything on it, and --",
        "Q: So you were really --",
        "A: -- I got vitamins.",
        "Q: Right, I was going to say you\u2019ve got minerals, and --",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I bring it home, and I couldn\u2019t tell my father, and we had to cheat him, and telling\nhim that I got it as a reward, and I found it, and I -- I don\u2019t know what kind of excuses I\nfound that he eats half a tomato.",
        "Q: The tape is running out, we\u2019re going to change tapes.",
        "A: I have to get up and get --\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: I want to go back to the tomatoes for a minute. How -- when you carried a lot of\ntomatoes, how many could you carry?",
        "A: Well, the maximum that we counted what I carried were 33 tomatoes wrapped --",
        "Q: In your bra?",
        "A: In my bra.",
        "Q: Now these are not big tomatoes?",
        "A: Regular tomatoes. They are not beefsteak tomatoes. They are --",
        "Q: 33? Without breaking them?",
        "A: Without breaking them.",
        "Q: Did you have a very big bra?",
        "A: Empty bra, yes, very big, I had nothing there. But --",
        "Q: Because it seems inconceivable to have 33 --",
        "A: Once we found on the way, and we happened to have a good gendarme with us, walnuts.\nBut if you know the walnuts are in a very prickly --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we put them in bra, too, and we got burned from the acid.",
        "Q: You got burned from the acid.",
        "A: On our chest.",
        "Q: But it would also hurt --",
        "A: It did.",
        "Q: -- because it --",
        "A: But you would bring it in, that was something totally different.",
        "Q: Now I[ have to tell you, my vision of you with 33 tomatoes is the Berusky would come\nafter you in a second because you would be so hu --",
        "A: No, we had roll -- the clothing, I had my father\u2019s shirt, for example. I -- sometimes to\nwork I had to have my father\u2019s shoes in -- in winter, because I put newspaper -- paper,\nwhatever we found in, because we were working cutting re -- reeds, and that was\nstanding on ice, sometimes little water. And I didn\u2019t have such strong shoes like my\nfather, and so he made me wear them so I don\u2019t get frostbite. So you -- you know, you --\nI wore --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] your father\u2019s.",
        "A: -- my father\u2019s shirt, I could put in anything. And when I worked with my friends, I told\nyou they worked four people on this little -- it was a little place where they had few fields\nof onions, she would give me onion. The onion burned you too, made us brown if I\nbrought onions home. But the onion was like gold, because that made any food better, if\nmy mother just -- but I don\u2019t know how often my mother -- my mother always found\nsomewhere some wood, and would -- would make something in -- we had a little stove\nfor heating the room, so you only got little leftovers of wood from the carpenters, so -- so\nshe always would find something to heat with. We were feeding pigs for example, one\nweek it was our job, our group. We were a group that was put wherever they needed. And\nwe Stole the good potatoes from the pigs and gave the rottens only to them. So we always\nfound something different to -- to eat, and to steal.",
        "Q: And how many were in this group?",
        "A: We were about 15 girls in the group, sometimes 10, sometimes 12, and was always the\nsame group. You kept together one group, and you had a head of the group. And there\nwere several groups together and the head of all the tomatoes and everybody was Werner\nNeuflies who still living at age 95 in Israel. And we are still very friendly, and he\u2019s not\nwriting now, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to him. But you had a leader, you had a\ngroup leader, and you were a group. Now, when they needed to bring 1n hay, we had to\nall go and rake the hay and turn it over till it\u2019s dry. Bundle it and s-stick it up, and we had\nto carry the heavy bundles like anybody else. But we were all young, we were all in our\nteens, and -- no, we w -- had women that were in their 30\u2019s too, and had children already,\nthey -- so we were but still young people, so we could do it. And we had the vitamins.",
        "Q: Was -- where there may -- comparable male groups, or were these --",
        "A: There were some male groups, but not field groups, not garden groups. Males were\nworking with horses and different things where women were not working.",
        "Q: Were any of you in these groups knowledgeable about farming?",
        "A: I think so. My friend came from a farm, for example. She still lives in Czechoslovakia,\nwe see each other when we go there. She\u2019s the one who was singing in the choir. She was\nfrom a farm, she knew about field work.",
        "Q: So did -- did you learn --",
        "A: When she was young -- she was younger than I was, two years younger, but she still\nknew about it. The Prague girls didn\u2019t know much.",
        "Q: So you had to learn quickly.",
        "A: We learned. We did -- it\u2019s very easy, shows you what to do with tomatoes, how to plant\nthem once, and you do it. They show you how to make the plate around so water keeps,\nand you do it. And then you got through all the rows all morning until you finish.",
        "Q: And you said in your group, you don\u2019t know what other groups were like, but whatever\nfood you took out, you shared.",
        "A: We shared. We had three older wo -- old women we called them, but as I say, they were\nin their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, who were very nervous, who didn\u2019t want -- were not as risky. We -\n- we somehow -- I don\u2019t think we believed something can happen to us, that\u2019s the\nstupidity. And because they were so nervous, they didn\u2019t know how to hide it, and they\ndidn\u2019t know how to behave in front of the gendarmes, they would put us all at risk. So we\ndecided, hey you don\u2019t take anything, you go on the side, so you see you are free. And we\nwill, when we get behind the door, we will divide it. And they agreed.",
        "Q: So it was very smart.",
        "A: Yeah, but -- was very smart. There were days when we couldn\u2019t take, we knew we can\u2019t\ntake because it was a very bad gendarme, and we didn\u2019t know what he will do at the -- at\nthe gate. And so there were days when we didn\u2019t take anything, and when we had the\nfeeling it will --",
        "Q: So did you discuss this as you were in the field --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- and say, oh we think we should nothing.",
        "A: Oh yes, we worked together --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A. A: -- we worked together as a group. We worked together, we did\nentertaining together. As a matter of fact, the last -- on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1944, we\ndecided we will party, this is the end of the war, we -- two months and it\u2019s ended. And I\nthink we knew that the war is going bad for the Germans. So we decided -- we saw a\nroom and there was -- used to be a stove -- by that time, don\u2019t forget, after the transports\nin October, the ghetto was half empty, more than half we had a program.\nAnd I have the program, I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think I left 1t -- wrote 1t -- what\n[indecipherable] each two or one made a -- a -- a -- like a number performed, and we\ndidn\u2019t have anything to drink, but we were like drunk, because we said we\u2019ll be free, this\nis the year we will be free.\nQ. So you were there all night, partying.\nA. All night partying, yeah. Very quietly partyinh, nobody should hear.\nQ. Right.\nA. But we were together, we were very close knit group.\nQ. Right.\nA. But I think the others were, too, because I think it was a necessity, you have to work\ntogether, you couldn\u2019t do it on your own.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t hear fighting in the barrack, or people yelling at each other, having\narguments, or did you?",
        "A: Oh, some winnen -- women might have a argument that she threw down a piece of paper\non her place, or maybe, but we were so little in the room. And then I lived with my\nparents, there was no argument there, so --",
        "Q: When -- when you first got this --",
        "A: -- bickering, I would call it, not really fights.",
        "Q: Bickering, okay. When you first got there, this is before your parents come, and you have\na sort of substitute mom --",
        "A: Martha -- Mama Dittel.",
        "Q: -- do you -- Mama Dittel -- do you have a f -- a feeling -- d-does it take away the -- some\nof the loneliness because there\u2019s someone there?",
        "A: Definitely, definitely.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I had my boyfriend that I looked forward to see. We did part, afterwards, but I had\nhim there, too, so -- and -- and I felt freer in one way, I had no -- the people that looked at\nus differently, I didn\u2019t meet the others. We were among ourselves only, I felt much freer.\nI felt better. And I felt that when it is over in two months, I have my room, and my bed,\nand our apartment and my parents. They are still home. I felt privileged that they\u2019re -- I\nwas -- by that time I was happy that they didn\u2019t come. But was the bubble blew and they\ncame, but --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- which was again, I was happy to see them, I was unhappy that they had to come. But at\nthat time, the first few months, I felt privileged that I have still my bed at home.",
        "Q: So there was a Si --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why the bed was so important, because I think the bunkbed wasn\u2019t very\ncomfortable.",
        "Q: But there was a sense of outside security, because the war will be over, so you\u2019 ll have a\nplace, and here it\u2019s not so bad yet.",
        "A: Yes. You know --",
        "Q: Because you at least have -- yes?",
        "A: -- we -- my friend had scarlet fever, my other friend had typhoid fever, and I thought if I -\n- we slept together on the bunk so I might get it too, and then I can\u2019t get into transports.\nThe transports were hanging over you all the time. You would be rather sick than getting\ninto transport. But I never got it.",
        "Q: You never got sick?",
        "A: No. There was diphtheria, there was encephalitis, there was hepatitis, there was scarlet\nfever. What else was there?",
        "Q: Dysen --",
        "A: Dysentery. I was always healthy. I think the vitamins did it. But 0 -- even in the\nbeginning when I didn\u2019t have them.",
        "Q: So you were very strong, there was something in your system.",
        "A: Probably. Because in the end when we were liberated, friend of mine came as the first\ntransport that came, where we for the first time realized what happened, where we saw\nfor the first time -- we called them musselman, those devastated people that looked like\nskeleton. We tried to feed them. We were three girls that volunteered to -- immediately\nwe had to take care of them, and everybody was mobilized to do something for that\neffort. Forget the garden, and -- but s -- do something for these people. They cooked the\nsoup, but -- whatever they did, and they brought it and we were supposed to dish it out.\nAnd they all swamped around us, and the whole kettle and everything was down. We had\none girl that was like a general, and of course they broke another kettle and she screamed\nat them. They all -- you know, they were afraid of screaming. We didn\u2019t want to do that.\nWe got them -- she helped us to get it. We saw them like animals and -- and that was\nterrible for us. And with the first came -- the first women, there was my friend with her\nmother. And she was sick so she was in the -- in the teepho -- typhoid barracks. But it\nwas open, I could go in and out. So -- and she called for me and from the window I saw. I\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And she told me, I don\u2019t know, piece of bread or whatever. I\nran home and brought it, and I just walked into the typhoid hospital and I brought it to\nthem, you know, stuff. Then I went outs -- we had outside hothouses, you know, for stuff,\nand we had all this vegetables there, so I brought some veggies to them, something to\nnibble on, and nobody stopped me, could in and out as I wanted, and I did. And some\npeople got sick, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: It\u2019s really quite amazing.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I -- I was not afraid to get sick and I d -- I -- I never thought I could get\nsick. When I think of it today when I have a little sense, it\u2019s different.",
        "Q: You had some sort of immunity --",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: -- who knows? Who knows?",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Bef -- be -- when you were y -- there before your parents came, did you have bad\ndreams? Do you remember at any time having bad dreams, having nightmares?",
        "A: Opposite. I was dreaming being home.",
        "Q: You S --",
        "A: And it hurt in the morning more when I woke up around.",
        "Q: Because you were in a different place.",
        "A: They are not bad dreams. Bad dreams I had afterwards, not there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Right.",
        "A: Not there. I was always dreaming I\u2019m back at home. Because that was -- I -- I wanted my\nparents to keep the apart -- I wanted home, you know, we wanted to be liberated, and we\nthought life will continue where it stopped, but it didn\u2019t, and that was the biggest\ndisappointment, and it took out all the pleasure of being liberated --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because it was not --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- what we were -- we thought will be.",

        "A: End of --",
        "Q: \"43?",
        "A: No, \u00b042 --",
        "Q: No, \u201942 -- end of \u00b042.",
        "A: End of \u201942. \u201943 I was already in agriculture. \u201943 they were there. End of \u201942.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re there July \u00b042 --",
        "A: [indecipherable] there end of November.",
        "Q: And they\u2019re -- they come --",
        "A: Four months later, something like that.",
        "Q: Four months later.",
        "A: Yeah. Four and a half months, it\u2019s about that time.",
        "Q: So, to the beginning of \u00b043 --",
        "A: End of \u201942.",
        "Q: -- or the end of \u201942. End of \u201942. Okay. You didn\u2019t know they were coming?",
        "A: No, but as soon as my boyfriend got -- he working with the transports he got the list, he\nsaw them on the list, he came to tell me your parents are here. And then he took me over\nto them, he smuggled me in. Because nobody was allowed to come, but those boys that\nworked with the transport could, and he got me in. So I saw them still in the Schleusse,\nand immediately I put on my mother that I want them in the -- want her in Hamburger.\nMy brother and my father went to the barracks they were assigned to. My father -- I --\nimmediately there was a transport going to Poland, and I was afraid they would go, so\nimmediately my father contacted his friend who was on the Altestenrat, on the council of\nthe elders.",
        "Q: And who was that, do you know?",
        "A: Zucker, his name was Zucker.",
        "Q: And so he\u2019s he deputy director un-underneath Eidelstein?",
        "A: Yeah. And he made sure that he stayed. And he gave him the job.",
        "Q: So he got a job [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not right away, but he -- he stayed -- the transport I think went -- I\u2019m not sure when the\ntransport -- early in January or end of December. I -- I don\u2019t know when the transport\nwent exactly, I could check on that. And he made sure he stayed, and then he gave him\nthe job to make order, to make sure. My father had a vision that if nobody steals from the\nmain -- I -- I stole from the Germans, but he didn\u2019t [indecipherable] stealing either. So\nstealing is stealing.",
        "Q: No matter from whom.",
        "A: No matter from whom. If -- as long as everybody will eat his portions, then these old\npeople that were dying would get enough food, too. There was some truth 1n it, but I\ndon\u2019t think he realized that maybe the young people need more food than the older one,\nand the kids need more food. He wanted justice for everyone, and he worked very hard\non that. But he was very generous. All of his friends and everybody got a good job there,\ntoo, as long as he could take care of them.",
        "Q: Hm. But there\u2019s always --",
        "A: There was the end. He went with the last transport when all the -- when all the -- the\nwhole f -- Alteste and everybody was gone, so he -- he couldn\u2019t stay any more. Zucker\nwas gone, and I don\u2019t know what happened, why he was taken. There was a group of 20\nyoung boys taken by Heindel, out. That\u2019s why they wanted me as a witness against\nHeindel. They were taken off the -- you know where you get on -- into the train. They\nwere not in the train, yet -- on the --",
        "Q: On the ramp.",
        "A: On the ramp. And my father was among them, but he wasn\u2019t in his 20\u2019s, he was 50 years\nold -- fi -- 50 thr -- 54 years old. And they took them to the small fortress and they were\nthe ones -- which I found -- we found only afterwards, and we found his name on the\nsmall fortress too, and they were the ones that had to clean out the crematorium from all\nthe urns, and throw them into the river. And last time when we were there, there is a\nmemorial for these 20 men, and where they threw down the -- the ashes into the river.\nAnd according to Elna Haas, he was about six weeks, and then they executed all of them,\nall 20.",
        "Q: After they\u2019d finished this.",
        "A: Evidently. So that -- I found that out from Elna.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Mother -- that was the 20\" of October. Mother went to Auschwitz and didn\u2019t pass\nthe selection. She was 51, that was too old for them. My friend\u2019s mother that passed\nbecause she was with her, she said that she is 40 years old. She was the same age, 50\nabout, and that she\u2019s my friend\u2019s sister. And because she was naked then -- and she said\nshe had so many children, that\u2019s why she -- she lost a lot of weight, and she survived.",
        "Q: This was Mama Dittel?",
        "A: Mama Dittel.",
        "Q: When your parents came, and your mother is living with you, and then your f -- your\nfather is in Sudeten, do you thi --",
        "A: Yeah, and my brother, too.",
        "Q: -- for -- for awhile before -- and your brother too. Do they come and say that they have\nsome idea of what\u2019s going on in Poland? Or don\u2019t?",
        "A: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: They don\u2019t know anything, and they\u2019re not hearing -- or they\u2019re not telling you what they\nknow?",
        "A: We knew what\u2019s going on in Poland little bit, because everybody, wherever you got the\n30 [indecipherable] and as I said one of Mother\u2019s best friend, we called her aunt, wrote to\nher, 1n a way she wrote that it\u2019s awful, and the only thing that\u2019s good for her is the mirror.\nSo we knew that she had little bit of money that she could use in the ghetto. That was the\nmirror my father made for everyone.",
        "Q: Right. And she was in wudge -- Lodz --",
        "A: Izbica.",
        "Q: Oh, she\u2019s in be -- Izbica, right, right, right.",
        "A: From my real aunt I never got -- we never got news, we never -- she went -- according to\nthe book, I think they went to Sobibor, straight from Terezin, they never went to\nAuschwitz or anywhere.",
        "Q: Now, does it surprise you that you\u2019re not hearing rumors by \u00b043?",
        "A: We knew it\u2019s very bad, everybody was afraid to go east. We knew the Polish people were\nvery bad to the people. That was somehow known, that the Polish people are not\nsympathetic to the Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We knew that the Jews are suffering, that they are beaten and killed, and -- and we knew\nabout concentration camp. But there is still the belief that 1f you do and work hard, and\ndo what they say, they let you live. We didn\u2019t believe in mass extermination. We thought\nin masses 1s strength, and they can\u2019t kill hundred people at the same time. How dumb.\nThey could kill six million.",
        "Q: Mm. So your parents, I assume, are somewhat less optimistic than they were before they\ncome?",
        "A: But in front of us kids --",
        "Q: They\u2019re the same.",
        "A: -- they were always talking, it will be ending soon, you will have a normal life, you have\nto survive. Their aim was that their kids survive, they didn\u2019t care much about themselves.\nMy parents lost a lot of weight, even though we tried to bring and steal, they never take a\nthing, you know, from anywhere or anything. So we kids were the ones. My brother\nworked in the bakery and would bring additional bread, and -- which he would give his\npar -- our parents, and they lost a lot of weight. My father was a little belly, and you\nknow, he looked well-to-do, you will see it on the movie, and he was very skinny\nafterwards, and my mother too. And that went very fast. And I was bringing home the\nstuff, so you know, that didn\u2019t help, to [indecipherable] they were healthy people.\nOtherwise, there was nothing wrong with them. And they -- they considered themselves\nold, and lived their life, although they was only in their early 50\u2019s.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: Before the war?",
        "Q: No, no, no, no, when she was in Terezin --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- when she same to --",
        "A: Oh yeah. She started with the Putzkolonne like Edgar\u2019s mother, like everyone. When new\npeople come they start the worst jobs because once you are there for a little while, you\nfind a way to find something better. My father didn\u2019t start on that note, he started in some\noffice or something. But my mother started in the Putzkolonne with washing floors, and -\n- and I don\u2019t know where they all cleaned, and I have no idea, because I was gone for the\nday. And then -- for a long time she was very handicapped with her -- she got a terrible\nattack of sciatica nerve and she couldn\u2019t -- she could only lay down, she couldn\u2019t move\nfor weeks. Because there was no medication, nothing, no pain killers, nothing. So only\ntime would heal. And then finally I -- she got onto a bed so she could rest better. And\nthen it stopped slowly, and she started to work. So for some time she was incapacitated.",
        "Q: Were you concerned that she would be transported out if she was incapaci --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t?",
        "A: No, no, that -- I wasn\u2019t, because I believed in my father. We believed Father can do\nanything too, like my grandma.",
        "Q: And because he was in a sort of privileged position by then, could he protect your\nmother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You -- he could?",
        "A: And they also went together.",
        "Q: Later -- no, I -- yes, I understand.",
        "A: Because of that --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And at that time, I knew that if sh -- if I get her into -- there was a man that was\nresponsible, Edgar wanted me to tell you, for the agriculture, his name was Kurzawy. He\nwas not an SS, and he was really very good to us. When the SS came he was -- he would\ncall us all dirty names, and scream at us, and when the SS went he would said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s\nnormal again.\u201d You know? He would always protect us if he could. He was a great guy.\nIn 1945, he was imprisoned like all the Germans, in the small fortress, and the agriculture\ngroup got together and signed a petition and we got him out. And he ended up his life in\nAustria. But he was great, so I thought maybe I -- my sister-in-law sometimes worked in\nhis pri -- private garden in his house, it was outside the ghetto. So I thought we -- I could\nget my mother in to be protected, but my mother wouldn\u2019t let me, she said, \u201cAh, you are -\n- your father and me, we are together. We will go through this together. You have been\nhere before alone, you can survive again, and you have to survive.\u201d And she wouldn\u2019t\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: She wouldn\u2019t [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- she wouldn\u2019t s -- try to save herself, no. And I tried to get in, but they wouldn\u2019t take us.\nWe were 29 girls that appealed to everyone we could, including Murmelstein, who threw\nus out very rudely, that wanted to make a swap, 15 girls take in and 15 parents take out,\nyou know, swap it, it\u2019s number for number. No. Because it was a rule that we have to\nbring in the harvest, that -- and that what Kurzawy did. None of his girls were allowed to\nbe send away. He needs them for harvest, and that he saved everyone.",
        "Q: So do you now think Murmelstein in some way, even though he was not the nicest of\npersons, that he ended up saving the girls life?",
        "A: I think he did it -- I don\u2019t think he cared, I don\u2019t believe that he cared. I think he did what\nwas the order from the commandant.",
        "Q: So these people --",
        "A: And the order was not to send anybody who works in the fields.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Because they couldn\u2019t substitute the older people for you.",
        "A: Yeah. So I think that was his, and as a matter of fact, Kurzawy told me -- I went to him\ntoo, and he will talk to us. But he said, \u201cYou wi -- you won\u2019t be with your mother, and\nyou will be grateful to me that I saved your life.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cI don\u2019t ask you for\nthat. I want to go.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou will not go.\u201d That was the end. So then in February\ncame a Swiss transport. And I happened to be in the Swiss transport ti -- again. By that\ntime [indecipherable] could go, that was already the end coming. And I decided if he\ndidn\u2019t let me go with my parents, I\u2019m not leaving Terezin because my parents will come\nback to Terezin. I don\u2019t want to be somewhere in Switzerland. Besides, it\u2019s probably goes\nto the sent -- to Birkenau. Birkenau we knew -- to Birkenau two, and I do -- I\u2019m not\ngoing anywhere now. So I went to Kurzawy and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to Switzerland, I\u2019m\ntelling you.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, I want to stay.\u201d He said, \u201cYou can stay.\u201d And I\nstayed. Took me out of the transport. But that went to Switzerland",
        "Q: That really went to [indecipherable]",

        "Q: So he knew?",
        "A: He knew, but I didn\u2019t know it until my sister-in-law told me years later that he was sent\nto Auschwitz as one of the transports, and he saw.",
        "Q: And then he ca -- and then --",
        "A: And that\u2019s when he decided to save his groups, and his -- the girls he worked with, I\nthink. We think, we don\u2019t know.",

        "Q: right.",
        "A: -- very, very bad, you know. And we knew that the camps were worse -- the ghettos in --\nLodz ghetto was much worse sanitary and everything, that we knew. Everybody was\nafraid of the east, because the Polish people suffered before the war, with pogroms. They\ndidn\u2019t need the war for that.",
        "Q: I\u2019m asking this only because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: But nobody believed that --",

        "Q: Yeah.",

I was so upset when grandma died\nbecause I thought it\u2019s my fault, I should have taken better care of her, which I didn\u2019t\nknow what to do, how I would have been able, because they were dying at that time, the -\n- the book it says 220, I thought about 150 a day in \u201942, in summer. That was the worst\nsummer for death rate in Terezin. And after the war I said I\u2019m so grateful that she did,\nbecause they schlepped the old people to Auschwitz, they died on the way in the train.\nShe was spared that, she died in a bed. You know? And she was 86 or 88, I don\u2019t know.\nSo for her it was a good deed. But I -- we knew it\u2019s very bad, that we knew. Why would\neverybody fight not to go?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Terezin wasn\u2019t a bargain.",
        "Q: Yes, right. But the real -- what was really happening, no one was --",
        "A: The gas chamber we didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: -- no one had any suspicion.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t know that 50 is old. My mother said, \u201cLook, I am strong, I am still good\nenough to work, I can work hard and I\u2019ll come back.\u201d She didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Was too old.",
        "Q: I want to ask you some about, not only the requiem concert, but also other artistic and\nmusical and theater activity.",
        "A: We went to anything we could get our hands on tickets, or whatever they get. I saw\nBrundibar. I saw Bartibride. I saw all -- some operas.",
        "Q: Did you see, \u201cMarriage of Figaro\u2019\u2019?",
        "A: No, that one I didn\u2019t see.",
        "Q: \u2018\u201c\u201cCarmen\u2019\u201d?",
        "A: \u201cCarmen\u201d I saw. I saw -- I went to nearly any concert [indecipherable] to get on Alice\nSommer-Herz, which was the pianist I loved so much.",
        "Q: What was her name -- was her name?",
        "A: Alice Sommer-Herz. She\u2019s the hundred year old one, and -- and --",
        "Q: A hundred?",
        "A: -- I would listen to her, because sh -- to -- she played the Mozart, she played Chopin, and\nI loved that. So I would try to get to these concerts, but they were not only concert -- as a\nmatter of fact, we did some recitals of poems, because a guy, usually George Loy put us,\nabout six girls together, and we recite, just to do something, because we couldn\u2019t sing.\nBut that wasn\u2019t too -- too successful --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: -- cause people didn\u2019t listen to poems too much, so after short while it -- 1t stopped\n[indecipherable]. But we wanted to do things, because that -- that took away the\nboredom.",
        "Q: Did you have to pay for these tickets?",
        "A: With your ghetto gelt.",
        "Q: And what was ghetto gelt? There was actually money printed?",
        "A: Actual money that you get for your work. We played Monopoly. My sister-in-law made\nMonopoly board, I don\u2019t know where she got the cardboard, and with this money we\nplayed Monopoly sometimes.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. But I don\u2019t know what happened to it. She said all she has left is about two\ncalendars that she made for birthdays. You get -- you -- you paid with something, like\ntomatoes, and you -- she made you a -- you know, a something else, and the person made\nyou whatever you ordered.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I have a pendant that I got in \u201943 on my birthday.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we have it with us. Edgar didn\u2019t show you his pendant in those pictures. He\nhas one too, different. It has his -- his number, transport number in the Akar, and mine\nhas my transport number and the date on it. It\u2019s from scrap metal, it\u2019s not silver --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- it\u2019s not gold, it\u2019s just [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- it has a different kind of value.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. Did many, many people go to these events, or a small --",
        "A: It was always full.",
        "Q: It was always full.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how many people go twice or three times. Because it was also hard to get\ntickets, there was too many people that wanted to go, because that was -- for the two\nhours, an hour and a half, you forgot you were where you were. The music was -- well,\nI\u2019m not a musician, but I's -- would say perfect. That was -- anywhere else the concert\ncould be held, and would be great. She was a great pianist, so you know, I\u2019m not a good -\n- maybe somebody would say the piano wasn\u2019t tuned very well, but -- and there were too\n-- big competition, you -- sometimes you knew somebody who could get the tickets or\nyou -- you really bargained for that, but you got tickets, you went. I don\u2019t remember how\nit was later, because in the beginning you also had to be eight o\u2019clock home. Whether for\nFreizeit we were allowed, because this was all evenings.",
        "Q: Freizeit was Friday?",
        "A: The free --",
        "Q: Free day.",
        "A: No, Freizeit means that was the free entertainment, or whatever --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: -- you know, and that you got permission to go later out, I don\u2019t know, but I know that\nthere was a -- from eight to five, you were not allowed to be on the streets, but you had to\nget home from those performances, so that might have been allowed.",
        "Q: I just thought of something that may seem stupid. Ho -- how were your barracks lit at\nnight? With what? Candles?",
        "A: No, there was electricity.",
        "Q: There was li -- there was electricity.",
        "A: Electricity. There was only no heat. There was no heat or hot water. I don\u2019t know how\nthey had it in the kitchen, but in the washroom, where Edgar ad -- des-described it, where\nwe went every night to wash, and sit under --",
        "Q: There\u2019s no --",
        "A: -- the cold water --",
        "Q: -- hi --",
        "A: -- yeah, there was no hot water there.",
        "Q: You sat under the cold --",
        "A: No, you -- you jumped onto the [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: -- and sat down and opened the pipe, and -- and that was your shower. There was no\nshower.",
        "Q: You had towels?",
        "A: We had towels from home, sure. That was in the hun -- 50 kilos, in the 110 pounds. You\nhad towels, you had bed linen in that.",
        "Q: And then you sent this out to be cl -- washed?",
        "A: Only the big things you could send out to be washed, like the bed linen and the towels.\nYour -- your things, you washed in the cold water. You had a basin that you shared.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And you washed that. And where would you hang it?",
        "A: Above your bed.",
        "Q: So it would drip down?",
        "A: You hang it this way, they didn\u2019t drip down. [indecipherable] where you could. Also\nbetween the windows outside.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Wherever you could.",
        "Q: But in the cold weather -- really cold weather --",
        "A: Yeah, it would be --",
        "Q: -- it would -- it -- it would freeze.",
        "A: So you didn\u2019t wash that day.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how we did it. I don\u2019t know things of ordinary, we didn\u2019t have paper, we\ndidn\u2019t have pencils, only what you brought in. But then those people that work with it,\nthe painters, they got it, they might have, you know, some may k -- have come to their\nfriends, or again exchanged the barter system.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But paper was very valuable.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: There was no toilet paper, I don\u2019t remember ever getting a ration.",
        "Q: Of toilet paper.",
        "A: And any hygiene, there was no hygiene. But we all ar-are s -- young girls, did not have\nperiod for those three years.",
        "Q: You never got your period in Theresienstadt -- Terezin.",
        "A: You entered the ghetto, it stopped.",
        "Q: It stopped. You know it\u2019s interesting, because many women will tell you when they went\nto a concentration camp it stopped. But they forget that they may not have gotten it in the\nghetto.",
        "A: No, it stopped in the ghetto.",
        "Q: It stopped.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: And you had obviously --",
        "A: -- which was lucky, because we had no way of getting --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- anything. It started only when we came back to Prague. I don\u2019t know when, I mean --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- never thought about that.",
        "Q: Well, it was fortunate that it stopped.",
        "A: Well, evidently. Which we didn\u2019t think of at that time. We just forgot about it\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Were -- was anybody worried that they weren\u2019t getting their period? No.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That was the least of your worries. But you re -- you never got it? So immediately? So it\nwasn\u2019t that you were getting less food. Because --",
        "A: Well, it was the first three or four weeks and nothing happened --",
        "Q: Nothing happened.",
        "A: -- and that was it. You didn\u2019t worry about health those days, we were young, we thought\nwe are -- nothing can touch us.",
        "Q: It means you\u2019re invulnerable.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was the Verdi Requiem one of the most important concerts for you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And why was that the case?",
        "A: The most impact, the most -- because we -- I at least knew what they are singing about\nbecause my friend told me. She was singing for us, she was with Schecter. She knew\nwhat [indecipherable], and I took Latin in school, don\u2019t forget I went to school from --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- sixth grade I had Latin. So I knew what libera may mean, e-even if I didn\u2019t understand\nevery word, and couldn\u2019t translate it for anybody, I didn\u2019t know that much.",
        "Q: And what did --",
        "A: It was very powerful.",
        "Q: And what did it mean for you?",
        "A: I thought I am back in Prague in a concert scene. So [indecipherable]. You -- you forget\nwhere you are that -- those two hours, you -- you hear the music, you hear the concerts,\nyou hear the opera [indecipherable] it was only singing, there was no acting, there was no\nstage. I mean, there was a stage where they s -- were standing and the piano and only\nsinging. And you were back in the National Theater hearing the opera. I mean all in am --\nimagination was great.",
        "Q: So it was -- but all of the performances that you heard were important, was the requiem\nparticularly important somehow? Or was it more --",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I think so because it -- somehow our -- my friend told me what the meaning is, to tell\nthem that they will suffer. In the end, truth will win somehow, and we wanted to believe\nthat. You know it was very interesting, I thought I could kill any SS with cold blooded. In\n\"45 when they started -- when they marched them, they were torn, they were dirty, they\nwere not these spic, span with these high boots SS. I suddenly didn\u2019t hate them so much,\nI couldn\u2019t. They looked so vulnerable. I don\u2019t think I could have killed anybody, and --\neven though I thought I could.",
        "Q: So they became people again in some way\u201d?",
        "A: In some way they looked worse than we did. But in 1947 I went to England, and on the\nway back, I -- I brought some oranges. I had a one year old nephew, my brother had a\nchild with my sister-in-law, my friend. And on the all -- the all -- we went through\nNuremberg which was all destroyed, and I enjoyed that very much. And under -- in the\nstation we stopped, and I had these oranges, and chocolate in my trunk that my friend -- I\ncalled her cousin, gave me for everybody. And they were begging for food, those\nchildren. And I said, \u201cNo way do I give you German children anything.\u201d Like if those\nkids murdered all the others, but I could look at them begging for food, and I didn\u2019t feel\nguilty at all. And I know I was awful, I know I -- I\u2019m biased all my life, and not good, but\nI just couldn\u2019t get rid of it at that time, \u201947 was too early after the war. Now I am\ndifferent.",
        "Q: Do you remember the preparations for the Red Cross visit in June of \u201944?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because our group again, being put anywhere we\u2019re needed, was put on the\nmain square to do the grass. And it was all done, we had to clear everything away, new\nearth had to come. There was nothing, there was just mud and stones. We had to clear it\nof stones, which was heavy work, several times. The earth had to be brought in and\nturned over, and put in lime and stuff that -- to grass to grow. And then we had to seed it,\nand then we had to stamp it by -- by -- see, we worked days and days and days on\nfershernerone we called it beautification. And then when they did the film, we had to\nmarch because we -- we looked healthy, because we had the vegetables. We had to march\nwith our hoes, and shovels on our shoulder. And march in front of the camera, and pick\nup the cake, and then behind the corner, we had to put the cake back on, and a new tray\nwas brought in. Nobody could take a bite. That was just a little something that we had to\npick up.",
        "Q: This is the film --",
        "A: That Hitler made -- Hitler gave a ghetto to -- a city to the Jews, or whatever.",
        "Q: To the Jews. But it was never actually [indecipherable] the Jews.",
        "A: Yeah, the film that they showed, we -- we saw part of it, we saw our f -- one of our\nfriends in it. But the agriculture walking there, they never showed that. They said there\nare parts missing.",
        "Q: And that was missing.",
        "A: Maybe they didn\u2019t put it in, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: They never completed it as far as I know.",
        "A: Yeah, maybe they didn\u2019t put it in, it might be it\u2019s lost. I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So you were watching also, while you were -- while you were --",
        "A: We knew what they are doing.",
        "Q: What they were doing.",
        "A: We knew what they are doing.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The shops were being introduced, the shops were being staffed. My mother was put in the\nfood shop, where she was selling mustard and relish, that\u2019s all they had. But it was a\nchange, I loved mustard and bread, and that was the [indecipherable] delicacy.",
        "Q: So it went on long enough, so actually people living in the ghetto could go into that store\nand get --",
        "A: Yes, they -- yes, yes --",
        "Q: -- if they had gelt.",
        "A: -- it was -- it -- 1t took time to establish that it took time till the grass grew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then we had to cut it to -- to -- you know, to make sure it looks good.",
        "Q: And could every --",
        "A: Have the flower planted too, flowers. There were -- 1t was made beautiful. They were\nputting up -- one space was for the gazebo for the musicians or something. And on the\nday of the inspection, I was in the fields working, I was not in town. We were rarely in\ntown during the day, because once the grass grew and was finished, we went back to the\nfields, cause those had to be taken care of, and the summer is still most work. So on the\nday of th -- I never saw the --",
        "Q: The Red Cross.",
        "A: -- people, the Red Cross or anybody.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay. Now, during that period before the Red Cross visit, could anyone who had\nfree time walk in that area and go into the shops? Or was that a restricted area to only\ncertain people?",
        "A: It was a restricted area, it was in the middle of the town, and I don\u2019t know when the shops\nopened exactly, but once they were opened, I think you could go in. I don\u2019t think -- I\ndon\u2019t know how early before that they opened it, but in the ghetto, was no restricted area.\nI have no idea how it was during the exi -- actual inspection, whether they restricted the\nmain street where they walked, because I was outside.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: Now, it\u2019s a few months -- well, it\u2019s four months, June, July, August, September -- five\nmonths after this visit, that your parents and brother are deported. Are you living together\nduring this period, or have you wi -- now been separated? Are you --",
        "A: Until they were deported, I stayed in the room with them.",
        "Q: You stayed with them.",
        "A: My brother next house. When they -- by the time they left, in the last transport, there was\nnobody in the house, I was all alone in the whole house.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And my sister-in-law was in another house around the corner, and she was alone, too. So\nfirst we moved in together. I moved over there, I -- I didn\u2019t want to stay in -- in that\nroom, I -- I had nightmares, I was -- I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, I was afraid to stay there\nalone. I tried to save few of the things. When you went to Auschwitz, you were allowed\nyour backpack and what you can carry, no more a trunk, that stayed all with me, the three\ntrunks. My brother\u2019s things too. And then the agriculture department opened a house\nright opposite where we had the place where we gathered for work. And my sister-in-law\nimmediately, through her supervisor, got a room for us there. So we were five girls that\nmoved in into that house in one room. I don\u2019t remember the fifth, my sister-in-law says\nwe were five, I remember only four.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, I know this -- I know how difficult this 1s for you to talk\nabout. But y-you assumed that your parents were protected.",
        "A: Until they weren\u2019t.",
        "Q: Until they weren\u2019t. And at a certain point, I guess, the people who were protected stopped\nbeing protected, they just --",
        "A: They all went, and I knew there is no help by that time.",
        "Q: By that time.",
        "A: Because once my father says, \u201cWe have to go,\u201d I knew that.",
        "Q: And did -- you obviously spoke to your brother before he left. He was the first one to go,\nhe left on a different transport than your parents.",
        "A: He left on a different transport, and my sister-in-law says they got married the day before,\nI thought always they got married the same day he left. That was a period of time when\nme and my sister-in-law were jealous of each other. She\u2019s 18, I am 20. So, you know, you\ndon\u2019t -- 21 -- you don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Get married first if you\u2019re younger, isn\u2019t that --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: You -- not that --",
        "Q: Oh, oh.",
        "A: -- that didn\u2019t bother me, mi -- married my father -- my brother, not anybody I wanted. But\nshe would claim my brother more, and she would claim that she knows him better. Now I\nlived with him, he was a little baby, I know him better. So in Terezin we were bickering\nto, and fighting, and all that. When we came back and my brother returned, he was not in\na very good condition that time, because he weigh like 90 pounds, 80 pounds, he was\nvery skinny. He had the boils like Edgar. Didn\u2019t look very good. But the first thing he\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear my wife what she says, and I don\u2019t want to hear you. We are\nnow the only family [indecipherable] and you will get along. And that\u2019s it, don\u2019t come to\nme.\u201d So we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: That was [indecipherable]",
        "A: We got along, we had to get along, but not willingly. We love each other now, and I\u2019m so\nhappy when I see -- have to see each other every year at least. She was just here now. So\nshe left Monday, the day you came here.",
        "Q: And -- is that true, uh-huh. And Honza also was deported.",
        "A: He was deported --",
        "Q: Earlier?",
        "A: -- in the third transport, we -- we separated.",
        "Q: Before.",
        "A: Before, because I wasn\u2019t ready to be a true fianc\u00e9 or whatever. I wasn\u2019t really ready for it.\nAnd he wanted more experience, let\u2019s put it that way, as a boy.",
        "Q: So he was looking for more intimate experiences?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you were saying --",
        "A: So we separated, but we didn\u2019t fight. And when he -- he came to tell me he is in a\ntransport, this is in \u00b044, when they all were leaving in the third transport, and will I would\naccompany him to the Schleusse, and I said, \u201cYes, I'll go with you.\u201d And his last word --\nwords were, wait for me. But we were not going together, what do I\u2019m waiting for? His\nmother stayed, his father went, too. And we were very good friends, she came to visit us\nin Israel, his mother.",
        "Q: So he --",
        "A: He was an oldest child, he was a terrible --",
        "Q: Loss.",
        "A: -- terrible loss to her. She stayed in Terezin, we were there, because she worked in the\nmica, and those people were also safe because that was war effort. So she stayed till the\nend, too, like I did.",
        "Q: Now, when you talk about yourself, with respect to sexual intimacy, did you notice that --",
        "A: We knew what\u2019s going on, but I just wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t ready.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t ready, not in camp, and not under those conditions. That\u2019s not for me.",
        "Q: But you -- but you noticed that this was happening around you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we knew that, that there were plenty of girls who were willing, go ahead. I had\nbetter ideas about my life.",
        "Q: Was this surprising to you, shocking to you, or no?",
        "A: No. I just wasn\u2019t ready in the [indecipherable]. I wasn\u2019t ready because I don\u2019t think my\nparents would approve. My parents were all to me, and I wanted to live the way my\nparents wanted me to be. I -- my mother was very modern and everything. We never\ntalked about sex or anything like that, but I thought she wouldn\u2019t approve, so -- not just\ncasual, I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right. Do you think people were being casual?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They were?",
        "A: Yes. Even some of my friends.",
        "Q: And they --",

We went to the firm whether my\nfather wouldn -- get something from like pension or something that he paid, but of\ncourse, we were over 21, so there was nothing we could get. And the -- the insurance\ncompany wanted death certificate. We couldn\u2019t explain to them we don\u2019t have death\ncertificates, they died in a camp.

I don\u2019t think I wanted ever to believe that they are\ndead. And then we went to the insurance company, and then they told us, well the\nGermans took their life insurances and everything. It\u2019s in Germany. So we wrote to\nGermany nec -- to the company, and they said give us proof. They wouldn\u2019t give us the\nproof, and they didn\u2019t believe us, so that was lost.

I -- I saw -- I don\u2019t\nknow whether I even could have taken the suffering I saw in the other people and the\nstate they were in, imagining that my father would look like that.

        "A: From -- from auba -- August \u201945. I had to, I had no money. I had to take the job as soon\nas it appeared.",
        "Q: And you learned how to type, I gather.",
        "A: I learned how to type, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you good?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, they kept me.",
        "Q: They kept you, I guess you were good.",
        "A: I worked here 25 years.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes. In one job as Administrative Secretary, so I think I did okay.",
        "Q: Obviously, very good. And you married -- you met Edgar in \u00b046, and --",
        "A: Well, we met and separated, and he went to -- to Switzerland and I went to England\nbecause I wanted that -- I wanted to learn better English, and I spent about six weeks, \u00b047,\nin England, and I wanted to stay in England. And they offered me you could stay as\ndomestic. Well, when I wrote that to my brother he exploded. \u201cYou didn\u2019t survive the\nwar to be a maid. You have a job here. We are the only family and you are tearing it\napart.\u201d So I returned. You can go any time you want to England. And I returned because -\n- and then the Communists came and I couldn\u2019t go --",
        "Q: And you couldn\u2019t go. And then you re-met Edgar.",
        "A: Edgar, in \u00b048, when he came back from [indecipherable] and suddenly appeared in my\noffice. Had no idea why we didn\u2019t hear for year -- for the two years he was away we\ndidn\u2019t hear from him cha --",
        "Q: For two years you were separated, that\u2019s --",
        "A: A year and something, I don\u2019t know exactly.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And he found you, cause he knew where you were.",
        "A: I was still working, he knew where I was working --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yes.",
        "A: -- so he went to look up for me.",
        "Q: Yes. And you took up again.",
        "A: We started to go out again, and by this time he\u2019s a -- he was sophisticated, he was\ntraveled in the world, and he was good looking, and I got interested.",
        "Q: Right. More than you were before.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t interested before because first of all my friend was interested in him, and she\ninvited him, and I didn\u2019t want to take him away from her. I didn\u2019t know what the\narrangement 1s, I didn\u2019t know he was not interested, or interested in me more, I don\u2019t\nknow. I just didn\u2019t feel it\u2019s right. She introduced us, but she told me she 1s interested in\nhim.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But she -- she has a f -- she married, but she -- we planned together to run away with my\nfriend, the one that lives in New Jersey. By that time she got back the business -- she and\nher sister survived, so sh -- they got the -- back the business of her father. And she had\nsome money, and to get illegally across the border that time, what she found was like\n10,000 dol -- crowns, not dollar. And she did it, and I was visiting my brother at that\ntime, but even if I were in Prague I couldn\u2019t go, I didn\u2019t have the 10,000. So she left\nillegally in \u201948, in May. And so after she left, and Edgar came back, I had no problem.",
        "Q: Right. You could see him.",
        "A: She was gone --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- she was here in United States already. And she had a boyfriend, and married an\nAmerican soldier that was in -- in Germany. So we are very close, both.",
        "Q: And how soon after you -- you start seeing ed -- and it\u2019s Edgar Krasa, in case anybody\ndoesn\u2019t realize --",
        "A: Pretty soon I got interested.",
        "Q: Interested --",
        "A: Very pretty soon, he didn\u2019t know it that I made up my mind. That\u2019s it --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s the right person. The first time, no.",
        "Q: And how soon after you decided were you willing to meet his parents? Or did you meet\nhim s --",
        "A: He asked very fast about that, that was one thing that I didn\u2019t want, I thought it\u2019s too\nserious the first time when he started right away we go to visit my parents.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But Edgar took it as a visit. I came there with him, I agreed to it because I was already\ninterested in him. And the mother\u2019s -- he said, \u201cI want you to meet my girlfriend,\u201d new\ngirlfriend, whatever he said. And her mother -- my mother-in-law said, \u201cAnother one?\u201d\nLike what -- she shouldn\u2019t think she\u2019s the only one. And his father looks me over, I was\nvery skinny that time, and says, \u201cWhat do you see in her? Nothing front, nothing back.\u201d\nSo that was their greeting.",
        "Q: This is the introduction.",
        "A: But they were, you know, I have not seen a family together that all -- everybody, like two\nparents and the son. I -- I thought it was something marvelous to be invited to dinner\nthere, and -- and share.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And Edgar was a great son, he did not -- he would -- Mother would go with us to every\nconcert, which I sometimes didn\u2019t like, he doesn\u2019t even know it. Cause I wanted to be all\nalone with him, too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we had to go every Sunday to visit his parents and play cards with them, you know,\nhe was that kind of a son. He wouldn\u2019t leave them even -- he would bring the company\nthere.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I liked it because it was family. There was something tangible.",
        "Q: And it was a kind of devotion you understood --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- because you -- you had that.",
        "A: I think I respected it. I respected it because I saw it at home, too. My father and my\nmother were really dedicated to his parents. My mother didn\u2019t have her parents any more.\nMy mother was great with her mother-in-law and father-in-law, and -- and there was\ngreat respect, and we had to respect the grandparents very much.",
        "Q: You described yourself as feeling very guilty.",
        "A: Yeah, always.",
        "Q: And you still feel guilty?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Do you really blame yourself?",
        "A: No, but all the girls that went, like Eva with her mother, and the other Eva that I knew,\nsaved their mothers because their mothers had a reason to try to be together, would try to\nget to the other side. That happened.",
        "Q: But it didn\u2019t always happen.",
        "A: Probably not. I only looked at when it happened.",
        "Q: When it happened, and blamed yourself for not being able to do it.",
        "A: Yes. I couldn\u2019t do anything for my father.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was hopeless. And wouldn\u2019t be even near him, because men were immediately\nseparated, which we didn\u2019t know. But after knowing everything in \u00b045, I felt if I was\nthere, maybe I could have sav -- everybody said it\u2019s ridiculous, I know.",
        "Q: You know it intellectually.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: But not -- not in your heart.",
        "A: No. Cause I really tried hard, and it didn\u2019t happen, so maybe I didn\u2019t try hard enough.",
        "Q: Is this your punishment?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but I was tied to my -- you know, there are -- my brother was\nmore independent than I was. Since he was a boy, he was more inden -- independent.\nAnd my kids, thanks to Edgar were independent. I wouldn\u2019t have let them be\nindependent. So maybe that\u2019s -- I wasn\u2019t -- I -- I tell you, I wasn\u2019t mature for being alone\nin the world and do for myself. Some -- Edgar was. He was the one who fed his parents\nsince he was 14. Sup -- Supported this parents. And he was very easy to start anywhere\nelse life. For me there -- every time it was difficult. Whether it was Israel, or it was\nUnited States. And so I am not so courageous like he is. I needed somewhere to come\nback to.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "Q: I know there\u2019s a -- a lot more to your story after the war, it\u2019s very complicated, but I --\nwe'll have to do a lot of that at another time, but a lot of people think that when the word\nliberation is used, like [indecipherable] right, that everything is fine. And it\u2019s not.",
        "A: We thought so too.",
        "Q: You thought it was --",
        "A: We thought so too. But our liberation was, you go back home, I go back to school and\neverything will be normal. And of course it wasn\u2019t, it cannot be normal. And my sister-\nin-law who got the apartment back wasn\u2019t normal.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She got interrupted her schooling even earlier than I did. They did offer you -- they give\nyou a paper that you finished school, but what\u2019s the use, that education was missing\nanyhow. So you thought liberation means back to where you were before the war. And\nlike when you saw, if you go back to your hometown, it\u2019s not the same.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know that, or we didn\u2019t want to know it, and didn\u2019t think about it.",
        "Q: Right. That was -- that was the fantasy while you were in Terezin.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s a very difficult adjustment, if one ever fully adjusts.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think you adjusted?",
        "A: I think once I met Edgar, and we started new life, and then really, I think that was for me\ngood life. That was what --",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: -- | wanted from the beginning. I didn\u2019t want a career, I wanted a family. So I worked\nbecause I have to support myself. I didn\u2019t think of working myself up or something, that\nwasn\u2019t important. Important was to have family.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So my brother said -- I said, if I don\u2019t have a kid by -- or something by 25, I\u2019m going to\ndo it without the husband. My mother, you know?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Ahead of the time. So my brother joked that, \u201cI think somebody will sacrifice himself, I\nput an ad in the newspaper.\u201d I was determined to have it one way or the other. I was\ndetermined.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I wanted a family, but if I can\u2019t have it, \u20191l make my own family.",
        "Q: And what was it -- what was it about having a family. Was it reconstituting what you had\nbefore and recreating it --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah",
        "Q: Is that what it was?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that you could make it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I needed it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, some people are [indecipherable] they don\u2019t even want a partner or anything,\nbecause it -- it\u2019s -- you have to adjust to a partner, too, and all that, so they don\u2019t want to\ndo it. But for me that was important.",
        "Q: You said you mainly had bad dreams or nightmares after the war.",
        "A: After -- after the war.",
        "Q: Did that continue for many years? Does it --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- even now?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so any more, no.",
        "Q: And the bad dreams are --",
        "A: Even in Israel -- in Israel I was dreaming we are in Prague, want to get out, and can\u2019t, and\nEdgar is 1n Israel, how will we get together. Things being separated, so I had dreams\nabout that. But I think that stopped already.",
        "Q: And did you ever have nightmares about Terezin, that you were back in Terezin?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes. And can\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: And you can\u2019t get out.",
        "A: Always this can\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Or after we ran away, that I am back in Czechoslovakia and can\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That -- that did happen, yes.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m certain you\u2019ve dreamt about your parents. Or I shouldn\u2019t be so certain --",
        "A: I dreamt of a --",
        "Q: I guess.",
        "A: -- yes, I dreamt that I found them in a hospital in Poland. I -- I dreamt that they came su-\nsuddenly back. I wouldn\u2019t even know how they would find me, because we didn\u2019t have a\ncommon address --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or anything where to find me, but you don\u2019t think about these things.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And till today when I think about my parents, I see them the way they were in their 50\u2019s.\nI have no idea how they would age.",
        "Q: Of course, of course. When did you start talk -- who did you find, when you found\nsomeone to talk about what you had gone through?",
        "A: Nobody until Edgar.",
        "Q: Nobody until Edgar.",
        "A: Until he wanted to know what I did, or something, no. And until the 90\u2019s, nobody wanted\nto hear. People I worked with for 25, didn\u2019t even know I was in a camp.",
        "Q: Did they know you had come from Israel, from th --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And from Europe?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But they never said, what happened?",
        "A: They were young people that were born here and they didn\u2019t know it.",
        "Q: But you were in United States when the film, \u201cThe Holocaust\u201d was on television.",
        "A: Well then that --",
        "Q: 1978.",
        "A: That was in \u201978?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s when people started to get so in -- I thought it was in 80 - something, so I\nthought that\u2019s when people start to be interested. And that\u2019s when they started to ask\nquestions, yes, after that movie. That was a serial, and that --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- that -- that was anyhow fiction, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Yes, it was fiction.",
        "A: -- not a true story.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",

        "Q: Terrible.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "Q: But it worked, because a lot of people started talking.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And was it helpful then, or was it too late?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I think what happened to us is that we found out that being quiet is\nharmful, people should know that as we are dying out, there are coming more and more\npeople that will say it never happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s fiction, it\u2019s imagination. And in memory of all those that died, that 1t should be\nknown and so I can talk.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t talk in schools, am I correct? Is it --",
        "A: No, because I am not a public speaker.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I am very conscious of my accent.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a beautiful accent.",

        "A: On the tape I do.",
        "Q: Absolutely not. [indecipherable]",
        "A: And I get embarrassed in front of all people. I -- you know, this is fine, I can do this any\ntime. And besides, I already feel I know you, since yesterday and feel very comfortable\nwith all of you here. But total strangers, I -- I have difficulty, and Edgar can do it with a\nthousand people, he doesn\u2019t mind, and he will joke, and he\u2019s witty, I am not. I can\u2019t joke\nabout it.

        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t -- besi -- and again, I don\u2019t have what to tell in the schools, it\u2019s not such a\ninteresting story like his. Comes back to that.",
        "Q: Well, I guess that\u2019s in the eye of the beholder, what\u2019s interesting or not.",
        "A: I know, but you know, especially the way Terezin is pictured now as a paradise for the\nJews. So -- what should I tell them?",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t a paradise for you.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or for anyone else there.",
        "A: For anyone. And that\u2019s where I have the difficulty, take people back there, because the\npsychological, the fright when it came transport is going, new transport 1s collecting.\nWho is going to go, which friend is going to be in it? Will I be in it? Where 1s it going?\nThat -- that psychological -- that cloud was over you all the time. All those years, up to\nthe end we didn\u2019t know when a transport is going, until the Red Cross came. Because one\nthing we were afraid of all that, what will the end be like? Will they shoot us all? Now we\nare such a small group here, they have it much easier. Will they let us survive? And when\nwe heard the stories that they did not let the people survive, the last day they were\nshooting them, I don\u2019t think they would -- if they have time would have not be willing to\ndo it to Terezin, too. So that was -- we were always afraid of the end, even though we\nwere in Terezin, the end was for us a mystery. And we thought in masses is strength, that\nthey can\u2019t kill 50,000 people, but we learned that they could, so --",
        "Q: Let me just ask you one -- I'll ask you two more questions. One has to do with the -- the\nworld in which you live now, that -- that isn\u2019t the Holocaust. When you hear the news\nabout genocides in various countries, in Rwanda in \u201994, in Bosnia, in Cambodia --",
        "A: You are saying it\u2019s going on again --",
        "Q: Again.",
        "A: -- and it\u2019s everywhere, and still in the world. And I feel that humans do it to themselves.\nYou know, I couldn\u2019t believe in God afterwards, because my mother was such a angel,\nand my father helping everybody, how could they be killed? And the rabbi, I don\u2019t even\nknow his name, I don\u2019t know where he came from, I met him somewhere where I was.\nAnd I told him I don\u2019t believe because He let my parents be killed, and who were so\ngood. And he said to me, \u201cWhat do you think God looks like? Do you think he\u2019s there\nlike a puppeteer, moving his finger and saying this one die, this one live? God gave\nhumans brain. Humans are doing this to humans. He\u2019s not guilty, he\u2019s trying to make you\na better human. You believe in Him, you believe in good.\u201d",

If a man can kill a little baby and go home and hug his own baby, how\ncan he do it? And that\u2019s what the SS did. So they are not humans to me, they are just\nanimals. And I can\u2019t even treat animals badly, because they have feelings and pain; and\nthey could, so they are worse than animals.",

That was hers -- so\nthat was very far ahead of those days.",
        "A: And my father was concentrated on the prince, on the heir, my brother, who was older\nthan I was. He was studying with him, he was checking what he learned -- math was very\nimportant, my father was an engineer.",
        "A: More focused on my brother.\npushing -- very much pushing my brother, how he studies. He wasn\u2019t checking on me,\nbut mother took care of that. And so my brother really jumped a grade. He went from\nfourth grade already to gimnasium.",
        "A: Where normally it was fifth grade, and that was good because in the end he still could\nmatriculate with the last class, they matriculated before they closed schools in \u201939. He\nmatriculated in June, \u201939.",
        "A: He wouldn\u2019t have if -- if he didn\u2019t jump the grade.",
        "A: 21.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: No, not really. Not really, because on the other hand, if we fought, or if we did\nsomething, he always got it, and not me. He was the strong -- he was -- he was chubby,\nand I was skinny, and so I was the little girl, the princess who nothing should be done to,\nand he -- he got it. If we did break something, he got it, not me. So --",
        "A: -- w-we were not jealous of each other, we had a very close relationship.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. My -- my -- my brother was the older one, so he was schlepping me along\nsometimes.",
        "A: And I loved that, and -- and when we were older the girls liked me, because he was very\ngood looking, and they tried to get near him. So I had good advantages of having an older\nbrother --",
        "A: -- like my brother.",
        "A: It was very huge because the rooms were very big, but they didn\u2019t have the amenities that\na modern apartment had, and we did move 1-in fifth grade, when I went to fifth grade, we\nmoved to a more modern apartment, in different part of Prague. This was near the old\nsquare, these were the old houses, and they did have running water but they didn\u2019t have\ncenter heating or anything like that. You have the big stoves with tiles around them, and -\n- but this was very comfortable, it was big, and it -- 1t wasn\u2019t bad. You had to walk up,\nand there were no elevators, you know, it was a old, old house. People still live in these\nhouses in Prague today.",
        "A: Upper middle class, I think, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that anything was ever not given to us because there wouldn\u2019t be\nenough or -- all it a -- had to be, wh-whether my father will allow it or not. And --",
        "A: -- we went on vacation, we traveled to Yugoslavia. I mean, there was never question. But\nmy mother was still frugal, she did not like to throw around money, but I don\u2019t think\nthere was any problem with money all our lives.",
        "A: Every vacations.",
        "A: The next day after school we were for two months out of Prague, and my father would\ncome on weekends, or spend the week with us, but we were with my mother, out the\nwhole two months.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Th-Those were villas where people rented part of it, or something. That was\ndone not just us, all our friends were living the same way, the company we had were\nliving the same way. The girls -- not all the girls in school, because there were poor girls\nin school too, the -- were mixed. But the friends we had, the Jewish friends all lived the\nsame way.",
        "A: For a few years we always did. I remember we -- there -- there were several places where\nwe went in Czechoslovakia, then we were going to Austria for a couple years, or maybe\nthree years. Then we went to Yugoslavia, and then Hitler stop it. And it started with the\nSudeten, and then they didn\u2019t go after.",
        "A: \u00b037 we were the last time on a vacation in Yugoslavia, and \u201937 in -- in -- over Christmas\nwe were in Vienna, and then it stopped.",
        "A: We were every year in Vienna because my aunt lived in Vienna.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, that was the school vacation.",
        "A: Yes. It was hot, and dusty, and it was the town so you were outside, and that\u2019s where we\ncould play tennis and do things.",
        "A: My wa -- father was -- they called him director, it\u2019s th-the ravuss, the executive office, or\nwhatever you call. There was a big factory called Odkolek. He didn\u2019t stop there, he\nworked first with the [indecipherable] but I was too young at that time. That had about 80\nstores in Prague, that -- had a lot of employees, big factory and -- outside of Prague. They\nhad bread, they had chocolate, they had cakes, they had all the -- it was something like\nGeneral Mills, or something, you know, but they didn\u2019t produce for others, only for their\nown shop.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So he was a big shot at that time in our eyes, maybe there were some bigger ones. We did\nnot own it, because the rich Jews owned the factories. This was owned by a board of\ndirectors. I mean it was -- what do you call? They had the shares of that, and they were\nmo -- a-all Jews. And the day Hitler came, my father lost his job and -- and they ran\naway, most of them [sneezes |",
        "A: Most of them emigrated to Canada, the di -- the board of directors.",
        "A: Unfortunately.",
        "A: Well, I remember myself as spoiled brat, I --",
        "A: I could get out of my father anything I wanted.",
        "A: My m -- in my case my mother was the strict one. For example, we got our pocket\nmoney, and we had to manage our pock -- pocket money, but I wasn\u2019t a good manager.\nI'd spend it in the beginning, and I didn\u2019t have for the end of the week, and my brother\nwouldn\u2019t lend me, because he said you should have managed better. And I would go to\nmy father, and hug him and kiss him, and get some money, so that my mother doesn\u2019t\nknow. And I knew how to handle him, even though he was very strict.",
        "A: He was there focus, but --",
        "A: -- he was focused, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care.",
        "A: We wouldn\u2019t dare to bring a bad mark from school, because that was punishable, we\nwouldn\u2019t get money, or something. We were always trying to get -- because we had -- we\nfelt we had to, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I -- [remember one thing, I came home -- we were two -- this is more in the gimnasium,\nafter the fir -- five grades. I came -- there was one more girl -- Jewish girl in the class,\nsome were maybe mixed, but they didn\u2019t declare themselves, we were two Jewish, full\nJewish girls in the class, and she\u2019s still living, she survived the camp. We\u2019re still friends,\nshe lives in New Jersey. And we knew -- we -- the two of us knew German, because my\nmother wanted us to learn languages, and I had to learn French and German. And I\nwasn\u2019t allowed to learn English. And we knew perfect -- we spoke -- for us it was a\nspoken language, you still had to learn the grammar, it\u2019s the -- like in any language, but\nwe could communicate and we could talk. And the teacher was very nasty to the two of\nus, SO of course we said she\u2019s an anti-Semite. So I came home and I told my mother, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do anything with this teacher. She\u2019s not going to give me the right mark because\nshe doesn\u2019t like me and Erika, we are -- because we are Jewish.\u201d And my mother just put\nme around, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t care why she doesn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re going to find that\nmany people don\u2019t like you in life. You have to be so good that even if she doesn\u2019t like\nyou, she has to give you the good mark.\u201d And that was it, I could never tell her that\nteacher is against me, or anything because it wouldn\u2019t help. [indecipherable] perfect.",
        "A: We had to study, we went together and didn\u2019t -- we did try to be better than the others.",
        "A: Well, I got my good mark.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t -- when we -- we lost her, you know, in -- every year they change.",
        "A: And that -- that\u2019s -- my mother had no pity over me.",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in [indecipherable] when we went into a store and we had to behave better,\nbecause people shouldn\u2019t say the Jews are loud, or something, you know? We grew up\nwith that, that we are different, and we have to behave differently, too.",
        "A: Yes. And -- and --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism openly, never. But our parents made us aware that\nthere are people li -- that won\u2019t like us, and that we have to behave not to stand out. The\nJews were always afraid not to stand out and that was the difference from the Israelis,\nwho don\u2019t care what the other people think about you. The Jews were very caring what\nsomebody else will say about you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. We celebrated Jewish holidays, celebrated Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and\nPassover. Hanukah we got gifts, but there was a little tree, because we had servants, we\nhad maids, so for the maid had to be tree. And if a maid got a present, we got one too.\nBut we celebrated Hanukah. When we didn\u2019t have maids any more, we never had a tree.\nAnd otherwise we celebrated the Jewish holidays, but not the little ones, we never knew\nPurim we never knew, Shavuot, or Sukkot, or anything like that. We knew only the big\nones.",
        "A: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Passover, Seder, one day.",
        "A: Not the whole 10 days, we did o-only two days we didn\u2019t eat bread.",
        "A: Hanukah we did, and not as a big holiday, we -- we lit the candles, and we got gifts, and\nthat was it. Only one night we lit the candles, we didn\u2019t do it every night.",
        "A: For our own pleasure, for if we want -- if we want to buy ourself something 1n school\ninstead of the lunch Mother gave us. And if we wanted more than Mother thought it\u2019s\nnecessary for me to have. I would have gifts. We saved for gifts for Mother and Father.\nAnd we wouldn\u2019t get special money for that, and it was expected that we give something.\nSo we got pocket money.",
        "A: If you bought yourself some ice cream --",
        "A: My mother wanted us to be able to handle money, and since I remember -- I don\u2019t know\nwhen it started -- I think, in my opinion, started in sixth grade, because we didn\u2019t have --\nwe didn\u2019t have possibility buying lunches in fifth grade, in grad -- in grade schools. We\nwent home for lunches. So I think it started in sixth grade, and we could have lunch from\nhome, but I liked the lunches what the other [indecipherable] were buying. So that went\nfor my money. By the time sixth grade, we went to concerts, we went to the theater, we\nwent to movies by ourselves. We had to pay for it from our pocket money, which I spent\n[indecipherable] Sunday, sometimes all.",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "A: Every Saturday, and I only got it if my closet and my room was clean.",
        "A: No, only five minutes before, I [indecipherable] it up. Which my mother always said,\nthat\u2019s not [indecipherable], you\u2019re to keep it all week, but [indecipherable], but she\ncouldn\u2019t change me.",
        "A: But --",
        "A: -- my mother too. She made sure we played tennis, we -- we really had everything, you\nknow? Not -- I didn\u2019t grow up like a girl that had to work, you know?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t grow up without things. We had toys. My father made me a whole furniture --\ndoll -- for dolls, which he hand carved from -- you know, he was very handy with his\nhands, he was a -- he was also very nice, and draw beautifully, so we ne -- never got\nbooks to color, but he would make pictures for me to color, pictures of flowers, and I\nwould color them.",
        "A: We really had a easy life.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, we were -- we were taught to share, and we shared with my brother, and\nI did my sharing with my friends. I don\u2019t think I was ever selfish. Nobody was that I\nknew. Our house was very open, a lot of people came, mostly Mother\u2019s family, my father\ndidn\u2019t have family. She was very close with her sister, that\u2019s why we went -- she spent\nvacation with on -- us, she\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- my aunt was like a second mother to me. And I spend vacation with her in Austria, she\n-- when I was rough -- five years old. And well, my parents were very giving, so I don\u2019t\nthink we were selfish, [indecipherable] my brother.",
        "A: Discipline definitely, discipline definite.",
        "A: You had to greet every time you came, just stand there till you can greet them. We had to\nhad to sit at the table and not talk, because that\u2019s impolite. If you made a spot on the\nwhite tablecloth, that was an affair, you know? We were raised strictly in how we behave.",
        "A: No, after dinner.",
        "A: At the table. What happened is my mother wanted my father and my brother to get close\ntogether. She found some old letters, and old stamps, so she brought them, and my father\ngot interested in stamps. Old Austrian stamps since 1850, since stamps started to be --\nand my brother, they -- and they were sitting every night working on the stamps, and you\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, and you couldn\u2019t move the table, and I hated it. And Mother knew we\nwould do our knitting, our -- she taught me crochet, she taught me to embroider. We\nwould do our things like good Jews. We were always [indecipherable] together, we were\nnot, as kids, allowed to go out at night. And it was a rule, seven o\u2019clock was dinner, so\nafter dinner we had to do something. We\u2019d listen to the radio. We didn\u2019t have anything. I\nremember working on those stamps, and that was their hobby. The stamps, a lot of them\ngot saved, and my nephew has them.",
        "A: My brother\u2019s -- my brother inherited them, because I never wanted to have anything to do\nwith them, even after the war. And then my nephew inherited them from my brother. So\nthey still exist, and it\u2019s a old, Austrian collection that supposedly is valued, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I have no idea about stamps.",
        "A: Yes, and we were a kissing family, and very much so. That\u2019s why we had to kiss every\ntime you leave, every time you came back. But we were a very affectionate family.",
        "A: Yes, history and geography, that is mine. Hated math.",
        "A: And no wonder my father didn\u2019t bother with me, and ma -- my brother was a math\ngenius.",
        "A: My brother was very bright. He spoke five languages, and he was really very bright. On\nhim it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, the old Greek and Roman history interested me, loved that. All the stories about\nthe gods, and things like that.",
        "A: No, because I went into rryad gimnasium where you don\u2019t have Greek. You see the\nschools, are -- I didn\u2019t tell you the [indecipherable] gimnasium where there was Greek\nand Latin. The arr gimnasium where they kept only Latin. [indecipherable] in riyad,\nwhere they had the math and the sciences only, no Latin and no Greek. So from the riyad\ngimnasium where I went, you could go to both colleges, to the sciences, and to the\nuniversity. But the others weren\u2019t geared directly. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same today, I have\nno idea how it is -- things are there today. But you had to made a test, right, where you\ncan go. And the pressure was tremendous, and my brother made the test from the fourth\ngrade, and he was young -- a year older, I went in fifth grade for that test, and I thought I\nwill die if I don\u2019t get in, because my mother wanted me so strongly to study. But I did\npass, and God, I cried when they read the names in class, and I came out with tears, and I\nknew my mother thought I failed.",
        "A: Because I was so nervous and so tense that I let go of [indecipherable]. And as a reward\nwe went for ice cream.",
        "A: I was -- and in fifth grade.",
        "A: 10 and [indecipherable]",
        "A: That was end of [indecipherable], so I was 10.",
        "A: I loved school --",
        "A: When it came that I had to leave, I was devastated that I couldn\u2019t study any more, that --\nthat was, for me end of the world I wanted -- but then burns, my father said, \u201cThis will --\nwar will be over soon [indecipherable].\u201d You know, all this --",
        "A: -- six months and you\u2019ll be home.",
        "A: We were saying even two months, some people, not six months.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think my mother, as I said, was a little rebel of -- in her young days,\nbecause she told me little stories, when she got punished. Her mother looked so strict and\nsevere. And she loved her parents, and I went to the cemetery every time with her to visit,\nand she always cried, so I knew she loved them, and she -- I thought, how could\nsomebody love grandma, who looked so strict and -- and she lost her mother when she\nwas 2() years old, and had to take care of the whole -- my grandfather had a far -- big\nfarm, with employees, and things like that, not a small where he was the farmer himself.\nAnd she had to handle all the men, there had to be cooked for all the employees. And she\nhas to take care -- I mean, she was 20. She also went to school -- not to a gimnasium,\nbecause they didn\u2019t exist in villages, but to a school for girls, to -- they call it pensionnat,\nand they learn behavior, serving, cooking, and you know, some subjects, too. Which was\nunusual, so maybe that\u2019s where she got her independence. And I don\u2019t think my father\nliked all that inva -- dependence sometimes because when she wanted for us to do it, and\n-- and do other things, my father didn\u2019t want always to do it, they might have a little fight\nabout it, but there were no serious fights, there were -- there were regular squabbles\nbecause we -- she wanted us to play tennis, and all -- swim and do things. My father\ndidn\u2019t think it\u2019s important or should be, or the girls should do it, too, you know? We did\nall the sports from very early age. Mother felt very important. You had to learn tennis, we\nloved it. We had to learn skiing. She tried to ski with us, but she couldn\u2019t keep up with\nus, and gave it up because she always had to be with us, my father wouldn\u2019t let us go --",
        "A: -- without her. And we -- the swimming I started at a very early age, and I did dancing, I\ndid gymnastics, I played piano. We had all -- everything was because my mother wanted;\nto travel too. My mother wanted us to see foreign countries, and -- the only thing that I\nremember when I started to be little older, and I loved the American movies, or s --\nEnglish movies, I wanted to learn English, and I was not allowed. English is for\nbusinessmen, not for young girls.",
        "A: Yes, I had to learn French. French is for girls. So when I came back in \u201945, I immediately\nstarted to learn English, cause I always wanted that.",
        "A: No, I wanted it because I wanted to understand those movies --",
        "A: -- | -- | ]-liked the sound of the language, I didn\u2019t like French. Especially after \u201938, I was\nhating the French, what they did to us. The British did it too, I didn\u2019t know that. Silly.\nAnd I wanted to learn English, and I started in \u201945, and by \u201947 when I went to England, I\nspoke English. I was so di -- when I am determined, I do it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I admired them. \u201cGone With The Wind,\u201d came only after the war, and I\nmaybe saw it 10 times.",
        "A: I loved that movie. When I had to leave school, there was \u201cSnow White and the Seven\nDwarfs,\u201d on, and my father, as a -- to lessen the pain that I have -- they knew I -- I -- I\nwas unhappy about leaving school, but there was nothing they could do, and so he took\nme to the movies for that, you know? And that was the last time I was in the movies,\nbecause right afterwards it was forbidden to go to the movies.",
        "A: So I loved anything, we -- you know, it\u2019s interesting, when we were little, when you went\nto a movie, there were -- we saw Charlie Chaplin movies, there was always the Fox news\nbefore, and then a cartoon. And all this was in English, and I couldn\u2019t understand, I had\nto read. The reading wasn\u2019t so easy when I was little, so I wanted to understand. I don\u2019t\nknow, maybe that was the reason.",
        "A: Yeah, tha -- for the cartoons.",
        "A: We got them later than you do.",
        "A: You know, they came to Europe later, \u201cPopeye\u201d and all that. So we loved cartoons like\nthe kids love today. Not the crazy ones, but we liked the regular cartoons.",
        "A: And they had special performances for children, but once we went to school and had\nfriends, we could go on our own to movies, and that\u2019s when we had to pay for it. As long\nas we went with my father sun -- Sunday morning, we didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But on -- later on my parents did not go with us, we -- we went to the national -- there\nwas part of the school, it was -- they made student programs, and the student programs\nmeant that you got cheap tickets from -- from -- as -- as long as you were a student. And I\nwas only 10 years old, we went on our own to concerts, on our own to the opera. And that\nwas sun -- Saturday afternoon, and that was our program, Saturday after -- sun --\nSaturday morning we wents there to school, Saturday afternoon we went to the theater, or\nto the concert. Sunday we went to the movies.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because it was part of our schooling.",
        "A: As a matter of fact we had to sometimes write a report about it, that was expected of us to\ngo and hear it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nnn.",
        "A: This was normal. One subject was music. So sometimes you had singing, sometimes you\nhad history of music. Sometimes you learned about the composers, mostly Czech --\nmostly Czech music, and Mozart because Mozart was favorite of the Czechs because he\nwrote in -- in park, he wrote -- got not -- you know, mostly the Czech composer.",
        "A: Rorchak, and Smetana, and Such, and the --",
        "A: Mostly it was Rorchaks, and Smetana, because those were the popular operas. But we\nsaw Tosca, we saw Carmen. I mean, we went whatever the program was.",
        "A: Much ma -- my parents never went to a concert with us, we went with my brother, and\nmy friends.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- we tried to save money, we -- we didn\u2019t buy the expensive tickets, no.",
        "A: There was a special student prices, too.",
        "A: Yeah, and they\u2019re right in the back, we didn\u2019t sit in the orchestra.",
        "A: Piano.",
        "A: And then in Terezin too, I used to go to Sommer-Herz, to listen to her all the time.",
        "A: Yes, but I -- I -- neither my brother nor my -- nor me were very musical, I don\u2019t think so.\nMy father was -- had a tremendous ear for music. But it was part of the education, you\nhad to go through with it. And only when it was forbidden did I miss it, because I had to\npractice every day when I was little, half an hour, then later an hour. And the watch was\non the piano so that I don\u2019t practice a minute longer. So it wasn\u2019t in me, the music. It was\nonly because I had to do it.",
        "A: But again, when you lose it, then -- my brother to give up his violin, I -- they -- we had to\ntake out the piano and give it up, it wasn\u2019t allowed, Jews to have. I wanted to play then,\nand then it was not possible.",

I thought that\u2019s an omen,\nthat has to be. We didn\u2019t have a piano, we didn\u2019t have a refrigerator, the first thing I\nbought was a piano for him.",
        "A: No refrigerator, icebox. No stove, just the kerosene, but the piano was in the house. And\nwhen we came to Boston, I bought a piano for 25 dollars, that the kids can play piano. So\nth-that was what I was used to.",

        "A: No.",

        "A: In dance I didn\u2019t mind it. In the gym -- gymnastics I didn\u2019t mind, cause I felt secure that I\nwas good at sports, but music, no, I wasn\u2019t so good.",
        "A: First I was doing gymnastics.",
        "A: And that was with a German deutsche toonfuray. And then my mother didn\u2019t want that I\nget muscles, because --",
        "A: That was real German, German speaking gymnastics, and later on it was very\n[indecipherable] oriented, but I was there very early. And so she took me out, and I did\ndo dancing. Not ballet, but dancing, so there was more like -- not modern dances, it was\nlike dancing, you know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, it was like a ballet except dancing, you didn\u2019t stand on your toes.",

        "A: We had, when we were little, there were a lot of people around, I don\u2019t know. But we had\na nanny that stayed faithful to us, and we loved her very dearly. After that she got\nmarried, she would still come and help Mother, but al -- we had later on only one lived-in\n-- live-in maid.",
        "A: There were -- there were lot of people around that cook -- I don\u2019t know where they lived\nall, I don\u2019t know. We -- I remember only one live-in maid, but they were coming in and\nout, and the nanny was there. We loved her, so she took care of us. And she was from the\nsame village where mother was. She brought her in -- into Prague. And she died shortly\nafter the war. And she was the only one, where my parents le -- ta -- some money, and\nshe immediately said, \u201cI give you the money back.\u201d So we said, \u201cNo, we divide it into\nthree,\u201d my brother, me and her, because she didn\u2019t have an easy life. The other people\nsaid, \u201cYour parents gave it to us, when they come back we give it to them.\u201d They never\ngave it to us. Even though we told them my parents are not coming back.",
        "A: But she did. That was our nanny. But she died in 40 s -- \u201946, beginning.",
        "A: She was very sick when we came back.",
        "A: It started really for us in \u00b038, when Hitler occupied Austria, anschluss. Because mother\u2019s\nsister lived with her husband in Austria, and in June they moved to Prague. They were the\nones who told us the horror stories about Jews washing -- I mean, being beaten in the\nstreets, having to wash the pavement. But they were not taken because they were still\nCzech citizens. So they didn\u2019t touch them. And they got an apartment near us, and that\nwas the year [indecipherable] was very high. Czech screaming we will never give up, we\nwill fight, before Munich. And that summer, there was a -- the Czech organization called\nSokol was very patriotic, was all -- like a Olympiad. And all the schools took part in it,\nand then we marched through pr -- Prague. And I marched with my school, I took part in\nit with my school, my brother took part in it with his school. And we were all very\nchauvinistics, the Czechs were never -- we will fight, and -- the Germans, and we will\nnever give up. And my uncle who came from Vienna, was always like pouring cold water\nover us, and telling us today they scream we will never give up, tomorrow they will\nscream heil Hitler. And he was right. And then came \u00b038, September, and we did give up.\nAnd from that time on -- my father did look into immigration. Our life didn\u2019t change until\n15\" of March, because my father still worked. I don\u2019t know how he felt, whether he felt\nany anti-Semitism, but we have seen changes in school. We still went to school, nothing\nchanged, and -- but some people weren\u2019t so friendly any more, and some people stayed\nfriendly. But it was a very uneasy -- the slogans were volt -- which rhymes in Czech, Volt\nnumber eight had again conquered noses, which meant the Jewish noses. The typical Jew\nhad a crooked nose, and so that\u2019s -- was always said, that\u2019s Jewish. And the situation\nchanged, you didn\u2019t feel so safe any more. And -- but in 15\" of March, the day I will\nnever forget, it was snowing, it was very raw. Where we lived -- we moved from that\n[indecipherable] other d -- apartment. Jews did not -- there were no condominiums, you\neither owned a house, or an apartment. Houses to own, rent -- to own big apartment\nhouses, you really had to be very rich, because you did not -- mortgages were not like\nyou buy a house today here in the United States. So we had a large apartment again, in --\non Benohuradi, which was a modern, and much nicer part of Prague, more green there.\nAnd I went to school there in my fifth grade, and then I had to walk downtown to school.\nWe didn\u2019t use public transportation, we walked to school and home. And it started -- I --\nacross from our house was a German school. And the German school was immediately\noccupied, 15\" of March by German soldiers. They came -- they -- at four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, the telephone rang in our house, and my father picked up the telephone, it was\nsomebody from the factory, I don\u2019t know who called, telling my father Hitler crossed the\nborder, Sudeten -- from Sudeten into Bohemia. Don\u2019t come to work any more. And that\nwas the end of his work, 15\u2018 of March. And when we woke up, the school was occupied\nacross the street, and I saw the Hackenkreuz fa -- flags hung, and the German soldiers\nstanding guard from my windows. And it was snowing, it was very cold and raw, and we\ndidn\u2019t go to school that day.",
        "A: The German flags --",
        "A: -- with the --",
        "A: The swastika. And we stayed at the house all day. Also my parents decided to let the\nmaid go from now on, because my father was without a job. So that was the whole\nchange of our life.",
        "A: Not a Jewish business, this was a regular business, J-just a board of directors were Jewish.",
        "A: But they were gone from that day on, too.",
        "A: Maybe some of them are already left, I couldn\u2019t tell you --",
        "A: -- before, you know, and some other people bought the sto -- stocks or things. I don\u2019t\nknow the financial --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Because they wanted to please the Germans right away, there\u2019s no Jew working here.",
        "A: It was immediate.",
        "A: And a non-Jew stepped into my father\u2019s position immediately.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether my father expected it or not. We didn\u2019t, we kids didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t\nknow what was happening from \u00b038 in the job with my father. But I know that we were --\nmy father tried to get out in a way. I don\u2019t know what all this happened. Cause we found\na letter that a friend of his from Palestine had a job for him. And I know that my brother\ntook some Hebrew lessons, which, I didn\u2019t know why. You know, we kids were not told\nanything. We were not told when somebody was sick. As a matter of fact I could never\nforget that my parents never told me when my beloved grandpa died. I just found out\nwhen I came to visit grandma and grandpa was gone. We were never told anything. They\ndidn\u2019t tell us what the financial situation is, what --cause we lived -- we -- we didn\u2019t f -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel we don\u2019t money or something, you know, afterwards. We lived in the same\napartment. We didn\u2019t have to move. We had to give up -- later on we had to give up a\nroom that was among the Jews and Jewish community to -- people lost apartments,\nbecause if they lived in a certain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to\nhave it clean of Jews, and they moved out. Somebody else had to take them in. We took\nin two women that were refugees from Austria, two old women, they were only in their\n60\u2019s. To me they seemed ancient. And then we had a -- when they were deported away,\nwhich was interesting, Mother told me later, they had poison [indecipherable] and they\nsaid Hitler will not get them. But they said they -- they were going to Lodz -- they went\nin the first five transports -- they said we will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we\nwon\u2019t do it, because you have kids. So when you asked about the suicides, the German\nJews had -- some had poison [indecipherable] and the Austrian. We did not, the Czechs,\ndidn\u2019t think about that ever. And then we had another Austrian family, a man and a wife,\nbecause when they left, we had to take somebody else. That was not the German decision\nthat the apartment was too big for a family. And a friend of mine lived with us, too. It\nwas the decision of the Jewish community, agreement. You know, they -- they had to\ntake care of them -- their own people, nobody else would. And I think everyone complied\ngladly, we didn\u2019t need that much room.",
        "A: -- went to Lodz.",
        "A: They wouldn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: They told her about it. That\u2019s what my mother told me.",
        "A: They left us a legacy, they used to own in -- in Vienna, a like bread and breakfast, or\nsomething, a pensionnat they call it, pensionne. And they had a cookbook from 1906, I\nstill have that coo -- cookbook.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s falling apart, and I still bake from that cookbook. It\u2019s in German.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: You don\u2019t know, because the day Hitler came, you did go out that day, my mother went\nto the bank, wanted to take out her safe. And they wouldn\u2019t let her, the Czechs said no.\nThe safe was gone. All what she had in the safe was gone. I don\u2019t know what my parents\nhad in the safe. When, after the war I went there, because I knew -- I used to go with my\nmother, I knew the number, and I knew the safe. I went there, and the Czechs said the\nGermans took it all. And when we applied for, in Germany for German [indecipherable]\nwrote about it, they said, \u201cGive us a proof that the Germans took it out of Czech Republic\n-- of Czechoslovakia.\u201d So, that was gone. And the money was put immediately under --\nconfiscated. Your savings, and your money. But every month you were allowed to take\nout certain amount, so that I think that\u2019s how we lived afterwards. And then I worked -- I\nhad to do something, so my -- I couldn\u2019t go to school.

I hated\nsewing, but as a reward, my father bought me a new sewing machine, so that -- maybe\nthat will interest me in it. That\u2019s the same, except it started much later with me, where\nthey felt a girl has to have a -- something, if she needs to earn money, and -- because they\ndid think we will get out. Mother had some relative in Chile, and we were supposed to\ngo, but we kids were deadly against it, we didn\u2019t want.

        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t have such special foods, we had mostly -- first of all, after all the\nrestrictions, my mother had access removed from -- because there was a -- one store very\nnear us of [indecipherable] where my father -- and my father was loved by a lot of the\nemployees. He was very good with them. There was a young woman there who loved\nhim too, and her boss, you know? So she would give Mother out more -- more of\nnoodles, and more of flour, or things like that, without tickets. Because Jews had different\ntickets, and my mo -- rations, and my mother could go shopping only between three and\nfive. And I don\u2019t remember if it was every day or three times a week, Monday,\nWednesday, Friday. I don\u2019t know how, because I never went shopping, because Mother\nwou -- did all the shopping. So we didn\u2019t -- we had some friends would bring an onion,\nJews were not allowed to have vegetables, onions. There was a funny story. Fish we were\nnot allowed to have, and my mother got from somebody a carp, and if you know about\nHeidricks [indecipherable] of hi -- the assassination of Heidrick? That day, somebody\ngave Mother a carp, and she put it in the bathtub to have it for weekend. Tha -- this is\n[indecipherable] she was on [indecipherable]. And that night Germans came to the house\nto search, to our house. And when they banged down on the door, we woke up, and my\nfather right away knew it\u2019s German, my mother threw dirty wash into the bathtub, so they\ndidn\u2019t see the carp. But of course the carp died. So we had to have it the next day -- the\nnext -- the same day. They were looking if we don\u2019t hide the assassins. I mean -- you\nknow, they just wanted to make the Jews afraid, which they succeeded.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I tried to remember all of them, because I think I was in -- at that time ba -- home. Of\ncourse, the first was to wear the Jewish star, and -- because I considered myself looking\nJewish, I would be afraid not to. You had to have it on your coat, and underneath. You\ngot -- at the Jewish community you got a sheet of stars, you cut them out, and you had to\nhave it sewn on, not with pins, so that you can\u2019t take it easily on and off. And that\u2019s the\none I have sewn by my mother, still on her dress. And --",
        "A: It had to be underneath.",
        "A: Always it did, on the left side. Then came when schools were forbidden, any schooling\nfor the children. And in the beginning I still got some schooling, a teacher -- a Jewish\nteacher after work, we could go and read something, books or -- she had some books\nfrom history, so I would go in, she talked about history. It really wasn\u2019t schooling, we\nwere just -- they thought to work the brain little bit. And I don\u2019t know whether my\nparents paid for it, what it was, but I went with my friend to this s -- but second thing was\nthat Jews have a -- eight o\u2019clock you have to be home. Jews were not allowed to be on\nthe streets from eight to five unless they had a special permit. Jews had -- there was from\nthe beginning, eight o\u2019clock was Sperre, we called. And my father, being very concerned,\nwe kids had to be home 7:30. And I always said, \u201cYou are worse -- Hitler gives us eight,\nyou give us 7:30.\u201d We were rebelling against that, but there was no way, so our friends to\n-- we went ho -- they walked us home and then they went home, because they could be\neight o\u2019clock, we were the only ones -- my brother and me, we had to be home 7:30. You\nhave to understand, by this time we are teenagers, so we want to be out little later. We\ncouldn\u2019t. That was the next thing. Then came that we were not allowed to go through\npark. So when I went downtown, or walking, we had to go around the parks. Nothing\nwhere green grew, you could go around. Then we were not allowed to go to the main\nsquares. To the [indecipherable] like [indecipherable] squares, the old squares, you had to\ngo around, on the out squares. Then came you couldn\u2019t go in the street car, only the last\ntrain, the last platform. And if it was full, 1t was your bad luck, you couldn\u2019t get on,\ncouldn\u2019t get on, wait for the next one. We couldn\u2019t go to any coffeehouses, because the\nCzechs were -- even the young one used to be -- would go for a coffee or dessert in the\nafternoon, walking, and then sit down for a coffee. That was fibil, no coffeehouses at all,\nno movies, no theater, no concerts, nothing. So what we did, like young people, we met\nin -- every Saturday and Sunday with a group, in somebody else\u2019s house. And what was\nhappening, these groups became very close. You couldn\u2019t bring a friend unless everyone\nagreed. It was like a social club, you know, because you couldn\u2019t have it grow big,\nbecause only few people could come to the house, cause if it was too many it was seen by\nothers and it could be considered that we are planning something against the Germans, or\n-- so the groups had to be very small. I was in a very nice group and I have pictures when\nwe put up plays and we put up plays with -- with our friend Rhode, and then we showed\nit to the parents, so we had something to do in the afternoon. At 7:30 I had to be home. It\nwas only for the afternoon.",
        "A: 7:30, seven nights a week, 7:30 I had to be home. When we were young it was seven, and\nthen it ca -- became 7:30.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was dinner, and we had to be together. Meals were always together.",
        "A: And there was no excuse from meals. We had to be together, and if something was\nconflicting with it, we had to give it up, because my father wanted to see us.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: My parents did, but not my friends.",
        "A: N-No. My parents had their friends. And when we were little we couldn\u2019t have dinner\nwith them, when we were bigger, we could sit with them.",
        "A: Be quiet.",

        "A: -- [have some pictures from it, and I don\u2019t even remember what they were.",
        "A: But -- we were acting. Our friend who died in Terezin afterwards, very early, was the\nfirst one we lost, which was such a shock to us, he was 21, in 1943. And he was very\nintelligent, and very bright, an intellectual, and he wrote them, and he was so the -- the\ndirector, and he choosed who was doing what. And that was fun to do because we had\nnothing to do the afternoon. We would play, like we had a -- a record player, we would\nplay music, we would do little dancing, but you had to be careful not to make noise so the\nneighbors don\u2019t hear. You know, we had nothing to do much in the afternoons, except be\nin the apartment. Next week we went in somebody else. So we tried -- so he tried to do,\nand then we had rehearsals for months, and months, and months. And then one\nproduction the parents would come and watch us do it, which was so childish I think\ntoday, but we didn\u2019t think so at that time.",
        "A: Because during the week we were working --",
        "A: -- that was our free afternoon.",

I\nremember when we knew this will be forbidden, and we have to wear the star, with a\nfriend I went to see this -- the castle, and go through the church there, which was such a\nfamous part of Czech history, because we knew we won\u2019t be able to do it any more. We\ncouldn\u2019t go to a museum, we couldn\u2019t go to a church, to -- you know, one thing what we\ndid too, which was interesting when you talk about concerts, we went to church to s --\nhear the mass, Bach, and all that as kids. In the church were the concerts Sunday\nmorning, we went to the church and listened. Music was very big part of our life, and I\ndidn\u2019t give it to my kids here as much.

        "A: -- my father had a short wave radio. And Father listened to BBC, and to Voice of\nAmerica, and to -- mostly the British one they had.",
        "A: Yeah. And he would watch what the war is doing, and he was very optimistic. Then we\nhad to give up the radio. Bicycles had to be given -- my brother owned a bicycle, I never\ndid because my mother wouldn\u2019t let me ride a bike, I would have muscles on my legs,\nlegs should be nice and smooth. So my brother, to give up his bicycle, what he did 1s he\nlet out the air from the -- from the bike, and walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and\neverything because he says he\u2019s not going to give it in a good condition to the Germans.\nAnd the radio we didn\u2019t give up either. From this non-Jewish friend, the father came and\nswitched the radio, he had a very ordinary radio, where he could catch only one station.\nAnd my father gave him the short wave radio, and then he would come and tell my father\nwhat\u2019s happening at night, slip in under darkness. So the ordinary radio, the Germans did\nget. So you didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- were not allowed to have a telephone. All my life I -- we\nhad a telephone, my father had, and we were not allowed to have it afterward. So they\u2019d\nstripped us of everything, and every time we thought it\u2019s the last thing. And another thing\nwhat the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some laws came up against\nthe Jews. So when Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were\nthinking, what will come this time? What will they take away this time? The jewelry?\nThis is my mother\u2019s ring. She always wore it so I never got another one from Edgar. So\nthat\u2019s her -- I don\u2019t know whether it was her mother\u2019s or whether my father gave it to her.\nBut when I had it checked, they said it\u2019s 1900 cut. That she hid for me. But you know, it\ncame slow. All these people say why didn\u2019t you ever -- weapons -- first thing was\nweapons. My father had his sword, cause he was in the Austrian army, and had a revolver\n-- had a -- a handgun at home. So he had to give that up, that was the very first thing. So\nthey stripped you slowly of all your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave,\nyou had no rights at all. And you -- if you didn\u2019t step -- when the SS man walked on the\npavement, when -- we had to step down into the gutter, whatever. We were not allowed\nto be in the pavement when the SS walked by.",
        "A: Once Hitler came, except for one friend, all dropped me like dead wood. One stayed\nfaithful, I\u2019m still with -- friends with her. She\u2019s the one gave me everything, she\u2019s the one\nwith the radio, and the first thing she said to me, \u201cI have your father\u2019s radio.\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want it, he gave it to your father, and you were so good to me, keep it.\u201d She still has\nit. But the others dropped us, wouldn\u2019t talk to us, would turn away.",
        "A: No, they just dropped us. They were afraid to be seen with us. I [indecipherable] and they\n[indecipherable]. But this friend still came to visit.",
        "A: I wa -- I did understand, and I tried to connect after the war, and the same thing\nhappened.",

        "A: -- I don\u2019t know. I met with them through somebody I -- I didn\u2019t know where they lived\nany more, I forgot the address [indecipherable]. We got in touch and the four of us that\nwere very close in the gimnasium, met. This was soon after the war, very early the\nsummer of \u201945. And I was devastated, I lost my parents. I had -- didn\u2019t know what I will\nlive off, I didn\u2019t have a profession. I wasn\u2019t that young that, you know, today you think\nthey are grown-up at that age, I was really immature for that. And I didn\u2019t know where I\nwill be tomorrow, and I had no roof over my head. And we met, and we went into\ncoffeehouse for coffee. And they talked about boys and dances, and dresses, and I don\u2019t\nknow what. And they were not interested in me at all, and I had nothing to contribute to\nthe conversation. We said good-byes, and I never saw them again [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. When you wanted to say something you were told, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, that\u2019s gone,\nwe survived, it\u2019s finished. Don\u2019t think about it at all.\u201d So that was the end. I don\u2019t know\nwhere they are, or whether they live, or nothing, e-except that one friend that I kept.",
        "A: Always optimistic in spite -- my father was so optimistic. I don\u2019t know whether he did it\nfor us, or whether he was -- first of all, he thought Hitler won\u2019t do to the Czech Jews\nwhat he did to the German Jews. And we always felt we are different. We are -- we are\nnot like the Polish Jews that wore -- you know, the Hassidic. We were dressed normally.\nThey always considered themselves different. And then we thought, he can\u2019t do, we are a\nprotectorate, we are not Germany, he won\u2019t do the same thing. And once -- special in\n1941, when America went into war after Pearl Harbor, we celebrated, this is the end of\nthe war. People said the next day will be end of the war, the America will just bomb\nGermany, and that will be the end. The Germans won\u2019t get up any more. It didn\u2019t work\nthat way.",
        "A: We were very optimistic.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Until -- until 41 when the transports started. That was a wake up call that maybe\neverything will not be -- first of all, in the first five transports, which went to Lodz,\n[indecipherable] the friends went already. And then in \u201941 in November, when -- they\nopened Terezin, a lot of friends went. And my boyfriend went, and that\u2019s a funny story\nabout too, cause that\u2019s wa -- how I got to Terezin by myself. And that started, and my\nfather had me to be always ready on time. Start -- my mother started to preparing for\ndeportation. We had our 50 [indecipherable] everyone had what -- what we didn\u2019t wear,\nwhat do you take with us.

Jews were not allowed to -- we didn\u2019t have it in rations, but my\nmother got some on black market from that lady that was her savior, and she would dry\negg whites, use only the yolks, here and there, and if you mix the dried egg whites with\nwater, you had eggs, you know, egg white.

        "A: My father -- I don\u2019t think other people did it, but my father had to be ready. And my\nfather made another thing, he handy with wood, he made mirrors for each of us, and put\nmoney in it. And these mirrors we took with us.",
        "A: Wooden back and a -- and a mirror, and in between was a hollow, and there he put the\nmoney. They took it each to th -- Auschwitz, and I had mine to the end, and my brother\ntook it to Auschwitz, and I had mine till the end, but when I took it out, marks were\nnothing, just a piece of paper, because they were German marks, and --",
        "A: We -- we still thought that the British --",

        "A: We knew one thing, that Hitler will not give up Czechoslovakia unless there is a war, we\nwanted that war.",
        "A: And the same thing happened to me when -- the Communists, who I never believed that\nCommunists will fall without a war. I said, there has to be a third World War to get the\nRussian Soviets down. Because that\u2019s what we believed, the Germans will not give up on\ntheir own. They will never move back. But of course, we saw Britain will coming, and\nwe -- the biggest depression I think what happened was when France fell. Poland, let\nthem take care -- Russia will take care of it. But when France fell, that was very\ndepressing, cause we thought they will move forward. And then they did the same thing\nin World War I, and the Czechs were saying French are good lovers, but lousy soldiers.\nThey give up, you know? But then the Czechs gave up too, finally. And the biggest\nexcitement was when there was invasion, when we thought that\u2019s the end of the war right\nthen and there, that the Americans --",

        "A: What they took from the Jews, they paid for the war.",
        "A: They had the money, the Jews in Switzerland, they supported them. But you didn\u2019t know\nthat time, but the Jews supported the war. And we thought they were run out of material,\nthey wouldn\u2019t have enough to fight with.",
        "A: My father had some connections in -- in -- in Terezin that he got news. What the\nmovement of the front is, he knew. But by that time he wasn\u2019t that optimistic, because the\ninterest -- the Altestenrat, I think he knew also what\u2019s happening, because he -- the things\nhe told me when we left, and I couldn\u2019t go with -- they did not want me to -- to volunteer,\nand I did, and it didn\u2019t help. But what he said is, \u201cWe had our life behind, we are old.\nYou have to survive. You have to do everything to survive. Don\u2019t worry about us.\u201d He\n[indecipherable] so he went to Russia.

        "A: He knew.",

They -- you\nknow, we ju -- when they made the pact with the Nazi -- the right and the left, they were\nmake a pact, that\u2019s just [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t think anybody believed that Stalin tells\nthe truth.",
        "A: Yeah, we were, but you know, people always think things are exaggerated. And it\nhappened there, it is not happening here. Do you know how today people think, happens\nto the others, it won\u2019t happen to me.",
        "A: I think that\u2019s what we thought. I think that was what we were hiding behind.",

They had a f -- fo America, and they were supposed to go to Cuba\nbecause they had to wait, and she just wouldn\u2019t leave. They already had their tickets, and\neverything, and she wouldn\u2019t leave withou -- without us, you know, and my mother, and\nthey stayed, and it was -- well, they died. And we were supposed to leave for Chile, and\nthen I don\u2019t know why my parents decided not to. And my father didn\u2019t want to go to\nPalestine, that was open to us. I don\u2019t know what was happening around then, because\nnot much was shared. We -- more was shared with my brother, my brother knew more\nthan I did, because he was little older.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We used to have dogs, never cats. Birds, parakeets, turtles, y-you name it, we brought\nanimals in. Both my parents were big animal lovers. When we moved from the original\napartment where I was born, I don\u2019t think there were allowed dogs there, because we had\nto give up our dog. Was a big German Shepherd, and he went to a farm in Votice, to\nfriends. So we didn\u2019t have a dog, but we always had canaries. We had different birds. My\nfather loved birds, and they loved him, because he always brought them goodies, and\nthey would sing for him and not for us.",
        "A: And w-we tried to get babies by pairing them, and had eggs, but that never happened.\nAnd we had to give it up when Jews were not allowed to have pets. But by that time you\ndidn\u2019t have -- thank God we didn\u2019t have a dog we had to give up.",
        "A: Yes, my parents found somebody who -- because canaries were pretty expensive those\ndays for you know, not -- your dogs you got, any dog you could get free, but -- so I think\npeople gladly accepted it. People had pets like that, 1t was a pet that they didn\u2019t have to\nwalk or do.",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact my aunt, who came from Vienna came out from the train, I\nstill see her, with two cages in each a parakeet, these little green and blue, you know,\nyellow and blue parakeets. She had them until she had to give them up, too.",

        "A: But it made you lose a friend, it\u2019s there, you know.",
        "A: Everything was a loss, whether it was the piano that I didn\u2019t care so much before, or\nwhether it was your jewelry that you got as a kid, and you know, the birthday present\nfrom your father. You didn\u2019t like to part with your things, so you didn\u2019t like to part with\nthe animals either.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, we did. Within the parties usually you found a partner, and then you switched. I\nmean that going together wasn\u2019t very serious. It could become serious. And then in 1939\n-- \u00b040 -- I think in the winter of \u201940, I don\u2019t know, I met a boy. That time we were still\ngoing to Hagiboar, which was like a playground where you could run around, and do a\nlittle sports. That was Jewish, so that was allowed to go to. And I met him there through\nanother friend of my friend. Since 1939, a girl lived with us. My very clo -- became a\nclose friend of mine. Her parents lived outside, and they wanted her to learn the\nprofession, so she was learning to sew in some other place than I did. And she lived with\nus and we shared a room, and ti -- tha -- used to go weekends to her parents\n[indecipherable] just fun. But then even that was forbidden because Jews couldn\u2019t travel\nby train at all. So then she couldn\u2019t visit her parents and met them only again in\nTheresienstadt, which they came from the village, she came from Prague. And her\nbrother also stayed in Prague, and lived with my aunt, who was around the corner, wasn\u2019t\nvery far. So within, you know the group you were, and you had one or two groups,\nbecause you met Saturday and Sunday with others. You paired up with a boyfriend. We\nwere -- when Hitler came I was 14, so by that time we started to be interested in boys,\nand we did, and I had a boy that we got engaged when we were 16 and a half, 17.",
        "A: My parents and his parents didn\u2019t say anything, and that was -- he put me later on on his\nlist as a family member, and that\u2019s how I ended up in Terezin.",
        "A: I had to go before my parents, and even though my father was devastated, so was my\nmother, and I was. I wasn\u2019t ready. You know, I wasn\u2019t -- today 18 year old girls go to\nschool, and they are ready to be on their own. We were not growing up that way. We\nwere never alone or going out at night because we never had those opportunities. And so\nwe were, I don\u2019t think, not that grown up yet. So for me going for the first time out of my\nhouse, not knowing -- I remember the last night, thinking will I ever sleep in my bed\nagain. And my friend was staying with my parents, 1t was me who had to go. And that\nwas really for everybody devastating. And my father tried to arrange and go and tell them\nthat they want to -- they did not want to volunteer because of my brother. They felt if\nthey -- as long as they can stay out, maybe the war will end, and we will f -- continue to\nlive our normal life. So they didn\u2019t volunteer, and I didn\u2019t want them to. So they tried if I\ncould wait for them, and they wouldn\u2019t do it, so I had to go.",

And they\nsaid if you put your family members on your list, they will be also privileged. So I think\nthat\u2019s why he did that. He didn\u2019t mean to get me into -- but that\u2019s how Edgar\u2019s parents\ntoo, because they were on his list as parents, came in early.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know how that was delivered, but I got a notice on that and that day, to be at the\npalace with 50 kilos, which is 110 pounds, what is allowed to take, and that\u2019s it, you go.\nMy brother went in the streetcar with me, you had to carry the 50 pounds yours -- kilo --\nyourself, up to where you had to register. What you had was a backpack, a roll where you\nhad your pillow, your linen, and you put in some food or anything. We call it bedrollup --\nbedroll, and the trunk. So somehow I got from my boyfriend -- fianc\u00e9, whatever you want\nto call it, a notice through his parents that I should make a white rectangle around my\nname because he will save my luggage, because the luggage was confiscated usually, and\nyou ended up only with the backpack and the roll. Not the first transport, only when -- in\n\"42, so Edgar doesn\u2019t even know about it. So, you know, we had to put Sarah in our\nname, every woman was Sarah, and every man was Israel, to degrade us more. We didn\u2019t\n-- we used to say we are privileged, because Churchill\u2019s daughter is named s -- Sarah. So\nwe very proudly carried that. I was Hana Sarah Fuchsova. So -- or German Fuchs. So we\ndid it, and he did save my luggage, and he saved the same way my parent\u2019s luggage. He\nworked at that time at the transports, and he kept his job to help people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he did do that.",
        "A: Well, you know, there were nine boys hanged for letter writing in Terezin in January \u201942.",
        "A: Oh yes, that\u2019s very well known.",
        "A: And -- because they wrote letters and they were -- and they were caught, so they were\nexecuted. Edgar can tell you about it, he was there when that happened, we --",
        "A: And we knew about it in Prague because that was made sure every Jew knows it. The\nGermans made sure, so that they don\u2019t write letters.

So he was in the streetcar with me at the back, cause we had -- as we were\npassing, I saw my father standing on the corner, he wanted a last glimpse of me. Crying.\nAnd then he just had to go another station, my brother, and then he returned home. And I\nhad to walk up the street to the entrance by myself.",
        "A: My mother stayed home.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well we were, I think three days or four days it took, till they processed the thousand\npeople. Register. And I don\u2019t think they even weigh our luggage, you could have had\nmore, but nobody dared.",

        "A: Eat everything, and they gave us this big portion of the watery -- brown water, which was\nsupposed to be coffee. So I promised Mother I\u2019Il finish everything I'll get. So I finished\nand drank it. My friend thought I like it, she gave me again. And I hated it, but I said I\nwill drink it because I promised my mother to eat everything.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anybody, but you start talking to your neighbor -- and I had the same name\nbecause you are alphabetically put on the mattresses. And you try -- you walk around\ntrying to find somebody whether you know, and it\u2019s a long day. You wait, you get to --\nyou have to go to the table, you have to register. You have to give up your trunk. The\nbedroll and the rucksack you carry yourself. This is in July. I had a winter coat on, I had a\nsuit underneath. I had double -- double underwear. I had heavy shoes because you\nwouldn\u2019t take sandals. And I had to lug the luggage, and we walked from Bohusovice to\nTerezin, and some people fainted, and some people couldn\u2019t make it, it was very hot. I\ndid. And when we came into the -- they brought us to Hanover barracks. That was the\nSchleusse they called it, the accepting barracks. Didn\u2019t take long and my boyfriend was\nthere, telling me, I have your trunk. And I told him right away to tell my friend that I am\nhere, which he did. And he brought her over, he smuggled her in, because nobody was\nallowed to come near us. And they had to process us again. And her mother arranged that\nthey move me to Hamburger where they were staying. She took over like my mother, her\nmother, and she later on saved my life again. So when we came to register, I already had\na address where to go, I went straight to Hamburg, and then my friend said she\u2019s working\nat the mica production, where we peeled the mica. So she went immediately and signed\nme up for that. So the next day I went to work with her. So I had somebody there. And\nthen you start -- and then I tried to locate my grandma, who was there. My grandmother,\nsi -- about three weeks before me -- 15 -- or four weeks, 15\" of June she left Prague, my\ngrandmother. So then my boyfriend located her, and that\u2019s when I say Edgar is wrong, it\nwasn\u2019t yet opened the ghetto, he had to get me a false document, of another girl to -- so I\ncan go to visit her into that house. And I did, and I saw my grandma.",
        "A: Not yet, it was op -- and she died on 22\u2122 of August of that same year, and by that time it\nwas opened. But when I arrived --",
        "A: -- | couldn\u2019t move freely, any -- and the first thing she told me, she was so happy -- she\nwas blind, but she knew who I am, she was so happy to see -- see me. According to our --\nwhat we counted, she was 86. According to what they have in the files, she was born \u201954,\nnot 56 as we thought. So she might have been 88. As I say, she lasted about six weeks\nthere. Got sick, she died of dysentery. And the first thing she said, \u201cTell your father not to\ncome.\u201d She thought my father was a powerful man, can do anything, and he can say I am\nnot going, and he will not go. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible place here. Why did you come? He should\nhave taken care of you, you should not come here.\u201d I don\u2019t think she understood, you\nknow, the situation.",
        "A: Oh, she understood that it\u2019s a bad place --",
        "A: -- but she didn\u2019t know --",
        "A: -- that you have no choice.",
        "A: Okay, my friend was named Eva, their name was Dittel.",
        "A: And I called her Mama Dittel afterwards. And she died in Munich at age 101 and a half.\nSo I saw her last time when we went there to celebrate her hundredth birthday.",
        "A: And what she did for me, in September of \u201942, I was put in for deportation to Poland -- to\neast, nobody knew where. And she decided that\u2019s ridiculous, her parents are still in\nPrague. She went to [indecipherable] and put down the -- my application. She was OD,\nOrdnungsdienst, so she could do it. And said, \u201cThis girl is not 21 yet, her parents are in\nPrague, how can you send her alone?\u201d And put stamp, do not send. So I got out of the\ntransport, and I didn\u2019t realize somebody else must have gotten in because of me. That\ntime we didn\u2019t think that way.",
        "A: That came only when the people started to ask are you guilty of -- yes, somebody else\nmust have gone, because thousand people had to go --",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s one transport where they have destination unknown. Nobody knows what\nhappened to the thousand people.",
        "A: That\u2019s the September transport to the east.",
        "A: I found it only, you know, after we got the -- the memorial book from Prague, from the\nTerezin inshairtif. They collected a book of all the names and birthdays and where they\nwent and where people died. And all the transport that went ever to -- to Lodz, or to\nTerezin, and where they went further, and their -- this -- under that transport, destination\nunknown.",
        "A: Well, that is hard to find who -- they have the name of the transport, you would have to\ngo through all the people.",
        "A: To find that there -- when you have your name there, it says where you were liberated,\nand where you died if they know it. If they don\u2019t know it, it\u2019s the transport where that\nwent where you died. Because many people went straight to Treblinka, so they don\u2019t\nhave the date or anything.",
        "A: She was a real, very aggressive, in that case woman, she got the job, and she would -- OD\nmeans Ordnungsdienst, which meant she was responsible anywhere there was a line, to\nkeep order, and so if she kept order on -- in the line for people to go into the offices or\nsomething when they requested -- everywhere you waited in line. Whatever you wanted.\nIn -- you wanted a job or something, there was 50 people lined up for that, too. So they\nneeded these people who kept people not fighting, and to keep them in line.",
        "A: So she had such a kind of job, she was standing near the kettle so people don\u2019t fight for\nthe food when they were giving out food that was her job. And Eva and I worked\ntogether. We are s -- friends, we were friends from Prague already, she was one of the\ngroup. So we used to go to her house, to our house, you know, and to others, she was a\nmember of one of the groups that I was in.",
        "A: And she was there since January \u201942, they went early. And her father was there too at that\nti -- and I knew the whole family, my mother knew the whole family.",
        "A: No, she was on the -- yeah, but she was also very aggressive, she could get it, you know,\nsomebody else wouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Somebody else wouldn\u2019t march into the office of the [indecipherable], she did.",
        "A: And she was accepted, people accepted her. She had a way with people.",
        "A: Probably, I don\u2019t --",
        "A: No, that -- that was ten -- temporary anyhow. They would assign you where to go, they\nwould make a list wherever they had place, but if you had somebody, and wanted to be\ntogether with the family, and there was room, they would do it. I got my mother then, to\nbe with me in the room, too. We just put it on her list, you know, as a request. That -- the\n-- where to put people wasn\u2019t difficult to get --",
        "A: -- because they didn\u2019t care. If there wasn\u2019t room, I had to sleep on the floor between the -\n- on the corridor until there was room. There was constant movement. People moved\naround, they found a friend, they wanted to be put together, that was not so hard to do.",
        "A: And transports went, so there were empty spaces --",
        "A: -- you when -- that was like a seniority. You started on the floor, and ended up where you\nwanted after awhile, when it got -- became available.",
        "A: So in the end, Eva and I had a bunk together.",
        "A: Hamburger.",
        "A: Hamburger. Hanover where -- where we arrived.",
        "A: And then -- then Hamburger became what they called Schleusse, for incoming and\noutgoing transport, but at mi -- sometimes it was a different barrack, whichever they\nemptied for it. When I came in \u201942, it was Hamburger, when my parents came, there were\nin a different -- Hanover -- when my parents came it was in a different [indecipherable].",
        "A: Schleusse is where the water goes through. People coming and going, and that\u2019s probably\nhow the -- they took it and was a expression I learned only in Terezin. In Czech it\u2019s\nSchoishka, so they took over the word, gave only a Czech ending. I-It means passing\nthrough, probably.",
        "A: The luggage never arrived there. The luggage was put on some carts that the people that\nworked in the transports schlepped, like my boyfriend, and they schlepped it directly to\nthe magazines or to the storage where they store them. This clothing original was only for\nGermans, that the Jews didn\u2019t get it, only until they opened the stores, did they share the\nclothing for those -- from those storerooms with the Jews. Because th-the Germans were\nbombed out, they lost everything. They needed clothing, so they took it from the Jews.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, but he did it for his parents, and for my parents too.",
        "A: He brought it after wa -- he kept it until I had a permanent place in the Hamburger.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have a space under the bed.",
        "A: I lived on the upper --",
        "A: -- upper bunk. There was a shelf and I put the trunk that was all where you had your\nclothes, you couldn\u2019t hang it, you couldn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: So you kept it in the trunk, and the bedding you spread on your bed.",
        "A: O-Our bunk was -- we had the top, the two of us.",
        "A: And the shelf was going towards -- there was a window, and the shelf was going to the\nwindow. So on that shelf I had the trunk.",
        "A: Yeah. The middle one had also a shelf, the bottom one had it underneath. But the trunks\nbecame my bed later on. The tr --",
        "A: Yeah. Three trunks made a bed on the -- on a trip with [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. I doubt it.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Arrangement?",
        "A: She was there already, and her partner, whatever -- whoever lived there, then moved out\nof -- I don\u2019t know where, was pretty fast, there was always a mor, or found a better, or\nfound somewhere else to live. When it emptied, and I was on the floor, a -- but nobody\nelse wanted it, I could get it. It went according to seniority. Each room we were about 40\nwomen in the room, and there was one woman who was called Zimmeralteste, which\nmeans the oldest of the room. And she was the one who made the decisions. So -- but she\nwas pretty good, she -- you know, honored some request, it didn\u2019t change anything for\nher. So it didn\u2019t matter if I was in the corridor, meanwhile, when my mother came she\nwas in the corridor. She couldn\u2019t climb up because she suffered from sciatica nerve,\notherwise I would have switched with her, but 1t couldn\u2019t. And then she got right away a\nbed because of that, so you know, she made those decisions, she also made sure\neverything is clean, that the room looks clean, because there were checks sometimes. And\n-- and I don\u2019t know by whom, but we were always expecting some inspections. And then\nshe also was the one that distributed the rations. You got a ration of bread. Sometimes\nyou got little bit of milk, which was like bluish water. And sometimes you got little bit of\nsugar, and margarine, those were the rations. So she got the whole thing, and she had to\ndivide it into 40, so there was enough, you got a big s -- soupspoon of sugar, if was more,\nyou got two. Bread was always the same, you got a piece of bread, that was for three\ndays. Being me, the first time I got the bread I ate it. In two days I didn\u2019t, so I learned\nvery fast that I marked how much bread I can eat every day. And that was only once that\nit happened that I ate it all. And I took little bit supply from what I had from mar. So, she\nwas the responsible person. She also decided if we had little bit of wood, when to heat up\nthe room or not, because there was only little stove, in that -- in -- for winter. So it was\npretty cold, but you had the blankets. You did have blankets. So we slept with Eva\nhuddled together under two blankets, we didn\u2019t need each a blanket. In summer it was\nmuch worse. The bedbugs were terrible, and we would take our mattresses and put it on\nthe corridor outside, in front of the room, along the -- you know how these windows are\nin Hamburger --",
        "A: -- barrack? Under the windows, and we slept outside, because it was too buggy, and too\nmuggy inside.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, straw.",
        "A: Straw. I think that\u2019s what all the Czechs used. I think that\u2019s what was mostly they used,\nhorsehair mattresses in good times, but I think for us they -- it didn\u2019t matter, we slept. We\nwere So tired, we slept. The first -- I wasn\u2019t so tired from the mica peeling, or something,\nthat was sitting down. We had fun because we were -- that\u2019s where we made most of the\nfriendships, we were eight girls together. Course the young clung together and we were\nalso a very noisy table, because we were telling our th-things, and we were laughing and\nthings, and the old people didn\u2019t li -- the old people, they were in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s,\ndidn\u2019t like it, so they were always hushing us that nobody can hear when we are there.\nAnd all of us knew that this is a terrible job, dusty, sitting and peeling them, and we had\nto make a -- sort them, and make a certain amount a day. It wasn\u2019t just playing, you\nknow.",
        "A: It\u2019s a-- it\u2019s a--",
        "A: -- the mica you have to peel thin, they said it\u2019s for the airplane, and there was bigger\npieces, smaller pieces, and you had to sort them according to sizes.",
        "A: Peel it into thin, like if you would peel --",
        "A: -- anything in layers.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You would peel it to the thinnest one and then the supervisor checked that there is not\nsomething wrong, no -- the sizes are all right, and -- because he was responsible to the\nGerman. So we all tried to get into a better job, and one of my friends with whom I\u2019m\nfriend to -- today, she lives in Los Vegas, she decided -- she had a boyfriend too, that\ntime. And who told her to get into agriculture. So she was the first one to leave the table,\nthe -- you know, the eight of us. Then two others went to agriculture, so I decided I\u2019m\ngoing too. And I went and apply for the job and they -- I said I come from a farm, my\ngrandpa was a farmer.",
        "A: So they asked me how potatoes grow, I had no idea, because I have never seen potatoes\ngrow. So I don\u2019t know where I got it, I said, \u201cLike onions, with the -- with the roots in the\nground.\u201d And they said, she knows, and I was in my -- in agriculture.",
        "A: What did I have, I had nothing from working inside. I peeled mi -- for mica that I\ncouldn\u2019t do anything with. I breathe in the particles, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: I wanted to get out.",
        "A: They told you get out into the fields, and you can eat the vegetable, so I got out.",
        "A: There was a place where you -- the groups always gather, that was called Drusstvo, it was\nlike a collection place where they had offices. These were lot of people, and lot of fields\nthat had to be. They had cows -- they had horses, not cows, and they had pigs, and there\nhad to be organization, and there was a head of that, and then over him was the German\nhead, who was in the party but was not -- who was not a SS, was a civilian. He must have\nbeen member of the Nazi party, was a civilian. So there was a organization, so they had\nto meet in the offices and the -- the storerooms where we stored some of it, because we\ngrew all kinds of vegetable. So my friend started it, she knew where to go, she taught me,\nI went there.",
        "A: And I got in. Which was in winter, which wasn\u2019t the best thing because we were in the\nfreezing cold all day. But you were outside, and you got out of the ghetto. My father, my\nmother never set foot out that since the day they came.",
        "A: And -- behind the wall. I was out every day.",
        "A: [indecipherable] group.",
        "A: A different sense of jealousy. I saw people, I said people still live normally, how is that\npossible? They walk on the road, they went with the horses, we had to go to the side\nbecause we were marching in columns, with the gendarmes, two gendarmes with their\nrifles, so we don\u2019t run away, or don\u2019t pick up a fallen apple, drop the apple from the trees.\nAnd people were -- passed the SS -- we went along the river, and we passed the SS -- like\nfor swimming place, and they were there sitting and enjoying themselves with children.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t have a normal life. It was very -- we were\njealous, why do we have to be like this? Why couldn\u2019t we be like them?",
        "A: Yeah, we -- we -- we talked about it, what we will do when we get free. You know, we --\nI remember saying I wish I was -- I cou -- I don\u2019t care how old I will be at the -- as soon\nas I can say it\u2019s 10 years after the war. It\u2019s -- you know, we wished for the impossible\nthat time.",
        "A: Not when I started to work in the agriculture, no I had the [indecipherable], I brought in\nthe vegetables, I smuggled them in my bra.",
        "A: Berusky yes, but I was the only person that never was examined by them or touched.\nWhen I went to work, they were there only at the j -- gate when I working on another\nplace. I was the good luck charm for my group. I had never been searched by them.",
        "A: Never. And I went every day to work.",
        "A: Those were women, SS German, that waited at the gate, that were allowed to frisk us.\nAnd of course, if they found something was the same like SS. So we were afraid of them.\nSometimes you had a good gendarme who would warn you, and some people were\ncaught.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I never lived it. I lived through one search. There was a big -- this was in\nsummer, June \u00b044. We called it afterwards, fashion show. What happened, they caught --\nthere were people who were transporting ashes out of the town from the kitchens, and\nfrom where they were heating in big -- I don\u2019t know, they were ashes. And un -- they --\nthey were stopped by some SS, and they found some lettuce. These people were\nimprisoned, and everybody who was on the field were -- had to stop working, and they\nhoarded us into one of the barracks, into one of those -- there were -- in the -- in the\nbastion or whatever that is, there were rooms, and there we had to -- they took four and\nfour wim -- girls in, and they had to strip totally, and the SS -- and we were stage --\nstanding naked in front of the SS, and th -- he checked whether you don\u2019t have anything.\nAnd then you dressed, and we didn\u2019t know what they will do with us, but they did let us\ngo. This took a whole day till everybody was frisked, till three or four, and we went\nhome. But while we there -- we were there, we didn\u2019t. But that was the only time I was\nfrisked like that. And because the gendarmes were there, and of course they knew us,\nthey were watching with us, we had to strip to be naked, we called it fashion show. And\nwe always said, \u201cOh, that one was in the -- at the fashion show.\u201d Because he was with us,\nso -- that was one time, but we still -- I don\u2019t think we were afraid that something will\nhappen to us, because we didn\u2019t have anything, whatever we had, we ate. A girl had a --\nsomething like a lettuce, so we ate it all. It -- it was just swallow a little wad of paper. My\nsister-in-law said they had to swallow something else, like piece of -- they had a crown,\nor the money on them, which was supposedly harder. She just told me now, I didn\u2019t know\nit. She was in -- my sister-in-law was with another group, she was there, too. So I wasn\u2019t\nsure which one, she says it was June \u00b044. Was hard to remember dates, you didn\u2019t have\ncalendars, so you didn\u2019t know exactly, but you knew when it\u2019s Sunday, and you knew\ndates, but to remember the dates, you don\u2019t. The one date I remember is -- did you ever\nhear about the census taking in Terezin?",
        "A: November 11\", 1943?",
        "A: Oh, we were the first barracks, because Hamburger is right on the edge of Terezin. So we\ngot the notice that everyone has to be counted, we didn\u2019t know how extensive it 1s, and\nwhat it means, but we had to line up in the courtyard at five in the morning. Because it\nwas November, some people took a blanket with them, which was very good, because it\nwas fr-freezing cold to stand there all day. We didn\u2019t know what they\u2019II do. And they\nmarched us into this place, which was not like a valley, but it was surrounded by little\nhigher, you know, not wall, the earth was like a division between fields, but it was higher,\nmuch higher, so -- there\u2019s a Czech word for it, like a small valley or something. And they\nmarched you by hundreds, always. And we came there, and we were one of the first ones,\nSo we were right on the edge. And they put the SS with machine guns on top of these\nthings, so we got little frightened what will be on -- they going to shoot us here? They\nsaid to count, somebody supposedly ran away, and there the count was off. And I never\nheard counting one by one. So I think it took nearly all morning till everybody got\nassembled there, or till 10 - 11, I have no idea. And then people started to walk around.\nMy brother lived me and my parents, but I was the only one -- by that time my father got\nthe room in one of the houses, and Mother and Father lived together, because he was also\nprivileged. And I still stayed in Hamburger, and my brother found with a friend in the\ncellar a room, and they made themselves in the cellar a -- a room for them. So he lived\nnear my parents, so they were together in the column, but I was again separated. So then\nmy f -- brother found me, and I went over to say hi to my parents, that I\u2019m okay, and\neverybody\u2019s there. But then you were afraid, because the Germans were walking by, and\nyou were not allowed to move. And when you have to go to the bathroom, luckily you\nhad the blanket, somebody put it around you. And they were counted, one by one every\ncolumn was counted. And it was getting dark, in -- in -- in November, it\u2019s not so long\ndaylight. And we decided to talk how nice it will be, I will kiss my bunk if I get home.\nWe didn\u2019t know whether we will be there all night. It was pretty upsetting. So by 11 at\nnight we got home. We were again the last ones, because we were the first ones coming\nin, some got earlier. The next day my father said that\u2019s it, the family has to be together,\nyou have to move in. So I moved in with my parents, I was very willing. I didn\u2019t like to\nbe separated. My brother was again with them, and I was in. My brother lived in the\nhouse next to them, so the whole block of houses went together, he was not separated. So\nthere was not room for another bed, so on the floor we put the trunks, and then we\nseparated them -- the door was blocked. And -- and when -- during the day we put them\nup like a seat. So that was the room I had there with my parents, in November \u00b043.",
        "A: Six days a week.",
        "A: Not seven, no. There were days when we had to work on Sundays when there was\nharvest, and maybe it would rain and they wanted to get the hay in, or the -- the harvest\nwasn\u2019t, for the Germans, going fast enough. Those days we would, from early morning\ntill light was out, 10 o\u2019clock or so -- there were days. But regularly six days a week.",
        "A: Well I have -- every group was different, and everybo-body -- I got into the group with\nmy friends because I wanted to be with them, with this girlfriend that I had. And I got in\nwhat they call the field group. And we were designated to take care of the tomato fields,\nwhich was near a village called Travcice, so that those fields were called that. And there\nwe went every day. We had to plant them, we had to tie them. Everything was done by\nhand. We had to clean all the weeds every time. We had to harvest them, we had to\nprepare the fields for next season. In between they had some kohlrabi or other vegetable,\nwe had to harvest that. And then if something was necessary, we had to plant other --\nother vegetable, there were fields. Spinach fields, there were beet -- beets. You know,\nanything that you are doing agriculture, there is always work to -- they would put the\nfield, and there was a Staabsgarten, which was -- they were the -- this was for the German\npopulation soldiers, or population. But there was a garden where they had vegetables\nonly for the SS, for the SS kitchen where they cooked for them, and for the whole SS\nsoldiers [indecipherable]. So my friend, the one that we went to school together, worked\nthere. And she went every day there to work. You know, everybody had different places.\nMy other two friends were -- their mother joined too in agriculture, and they worked on\nthe place where they -- so when I went to help out there, I had onions, I could bring home\nonions. You know, it\u2019s -- we stole anything we could, and we ate anything we could.",
        "A: What we ate, I wouldn\u2019t touch a tomato at home, I ate tomatoes all day. That was all I ate\nall day, I mean, no bread, I wouldn\u2019t use the bread when I had tomatoes. [indecipherable]\nmy stomach was full of vegetable, and we -- when we were harvesting kohlrabi we would\n-- but we had to cover up the peels or anything, because we were not allowed to eat. And\nwe had a lookout, because Heindel, who was supervising us, SS, had the motorcycle, we\ncould hear him. The lookout will hear him, so we wouldn\u2019t eat, and we would work very\nhard when he came. And if hear -- saw somebody standing up, he gave us two hour more\nwork, the whole group. So we had a lookout. And the lookouts were on all fields, and we\nwhistled. We had a sign to whistle, then he forbid to whistle, so we were barking like a\ndog. I mean, we found always a way to -- to -- I -- I have to put my hand up.",
        "A: Signal. And we had a lookout for that.",

        "A: We were very careful. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where the lice were more prevalent, but nobody had in our room, in the\nbarracks. You tried to keep -- you washed your hair, tried to keep clean.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Maybe in the beginning.",
        "A: We did. We had to go to the dentist, but he couldn\u2019t do much. My teeth were -- I got my\nwisdom teeth there, and afterwards they had to be pulled, but we didn\u2019t have much dental\ncare, but there was a dentist, yes.",
        "A: Probably they had to. I don\u2019t know if they had Novocain even that time.",
        "A: Yes., and pretty near us was the toilet. We were the last room -- we were 191, and the last\none was 190, and opposite was the toilet, so we didn\u2019t have it far. I don\u2019t remember being\nany problem with long lines, because we went late at night, maybe and we didn\u2019t go at\nnight, and the early morning because we had to go to work. So I don\u2019t think we had such\na problem.",
        "A: There could be a line here and there you know, but --",
        "A: There\u2019s always a line in ladies room, you know --",

        "A: No.",

        "A: -- with the hoe, we had to turn over the ground, we worked like men. But you know, you\nare not really hungry, but because you don\u2019t have it -- first of all, tomatoes, you full your\nstomach and in half an hour you are hungry again. And because you don\u2019t have it, if\nsomebody tells you can\u2019t have more in a day than this, then it\u2019s -- this is very small. So\nyou do feel hunger. And we talked a lot about food, but we also heard a lot of requiem.\nMy friend was singing in requiem, and while we were turning over the manure, she was\nsinging what she learned the night before.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. We were singing songs with her. She had a beautiful voice, and we knew\nwhat\u2019s going on, and we were waiting for the production, and we all went to listen, and it\nwas so uplifting that I could never forget it.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk what we cook, what we like to eat and what we would order, and what we\nwanted to eat.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything about cooking.",

        "A: We always ate.",
        "A: I think it was helpful, we tried to taste it in our minds.",
        "A: We were not really that starved. I can\u2019t say, because we did have something, but we\ndidn\u2019t see eggs for years, you know, so you were imagining how good eggs are. At one\npoint they decided that they will have silkworms on a f -- there. So four of us girls, and I\nwas among them, were responsible for the silkworms, we had to feed them. We had to go\nand look for mulberry trees, and a German was coming with us. We had to take all the\nmulberry leaves, put it in a bag, and then we came where they had the silkworms, and we\nfed them and cleaned out that. They were very nice, they were silky, the worms are very\nnice. And once it was in a farm, and the chicken lost her egg. Now we were four girls,\nand we were trying to get the egg. What we would do with one egg for the four of us, I\nhad no idea. But the -- the German saw it, and he picked it up, wouldn\u2019t let us pick it up,\nso we lost our egg. But th -- those were the things we were longing for that we didn\u2019t\nhave. We had the soup, and the black coffee and bread, normal meal. And sometimes the\ndumplings with [indecipherable] a treat. But you didn\u2019t have variety, you didn\u2019t -- so we -\n- we dreamt about that, we were hungry for that, but starving like they did in Poland or in\n-- in those camps, no.",
        "A: You see, I would pull out the carrot and eat it with the earth and everything on it, and --",
        "A: -- I got vitamins.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: And I bring it home, and I couldn\u2019t tell my father, and we had to cheat him, and telling\nhim that I got it as a reward, and I found it, and I -- I don\u2019t know what kind of excuses I\nfound that he eats half a tomato.",

        "A: Well, the maximum that we counted what I carried were 33 tomatoes wrapped --",
        "A: In my bra.",

        "A: Without breaking them.",

        "A: Once we found on the way, and we happened to have a good gendarme with us, walnuts.\nBut if you know the walnuts are in a very prickly --",
        "A: Well, we put them in bra, too, and we got burned from the acid.",
        "A: On our chest.",
        "A: It did.",
        "A: But you would bring it in, that was something totally different.",
        "A: No, we had roll -- the clothing, I had my father\u2019s shirt, for example. I -- sometimes to\nwork I had to have my father\u2019s shoes in -- in winter, because I put newspaper -- paper,\nwhatever we found in, because we were working cutting re -- reeds, and that was\nstanding on ice, sometimes little water. And I didn\u2019t have such strong shoes like my\nfather, and so he made me wear them so I don\u2019t get frostbite. So you -- you know, you --\nI wore --",
        "A: -- my father\u2019s shirt, I could put in anything. And when I worked with my friends, I told\nyou they worked four people on this little -- it was a little place where they had few fields\nof onions, she would give me onion. The onion burned you too, made us brown if I\nbrought onions home. But the onion was like gold, because that made any food better, if\nmy mother just -- but I don\u2019t know how often my mother -- my mother always found\nsomewhere some wood, and would -- would make something in -- we had a little stove\nfor heating the room, so you only got little leftovers of wood from the carpenters, so -- so\nshe always would find something to heat with. We were feeding pigs for example, one\nweek it was our job, our group. We were a group that was put wherever they needed. And\nwe Stole the good potatoes from the pigs and gave the rottens only to them. So we always\nfound something different to -- to eat, and to steal.",
        "A: We were about 15 girls in the group, sometimes 10, sometimes 12, and was always the\nsame group. You kept together one group, and you had a head of the group. And there\nwere several groups together and the head of all the tomatoes and everybody was Werner\nNeuflies who still living at age 95 in Israel. And we are still very friendly, and he\u2019s not\nwriting now, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to him. But you had a leader, you had a\ngroup leader, and you were a group. Now, when they needed to bring 1n hay, we had to\nall go and rake the hay and turn it over till it\u2019s dry. Bundle it and s-stick it up, and we had\nto carry the heavy bundles like anybody else. But we were all young, we were all in our\nteens, and -- no, we w -- had women that were in their 30\u2019s too, and had children already,\nthey -- so we were but still young people, so we could do it. And we had the vitamins.",
        "A: There were some male groups, but not field groups, not garden groups. Males were\nworking with horses and different things where women were not working.",
        "A: I think so. My friend came from a farm, for example. She still lives in Czechoslovakia,\nwe see each other when we go there. She\u2019s the one who was singing in the choir. She was\nfrom a farm, she knew about field work.",
        "A: When she was young -- she was younger than I was, two years younger, but she still\nknew about it. The Prague girls didn\u2019t know much.",
        "A: We learned. We did -- it\u2019s very easy, shows you what to do with tomatoes, how to plant\nthem once, and you do it. They show you how to make the plate around so water keeps,\nand you do it. And then you got through all the rows all morning until you finish.",
        "A: We shared. We had three older wo -- old women we called them, but as I say, they were\nin their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, who were very nervous, who didn\u2019t want -- were not as risky. We -\n- we somehow -- I don\u2019t think we believed something can happen to us, that\u2019s the\nstupidity. And because they were so nervous, they didn\u2019t know how to hide it, and they\ndidn\u2019t know how to behave in front of the gendarmes, they would put us all at risk. So we\ndecided, hey you don\u2019t take anything, you go on the side, so you see you are free. And we\nwill, when we get behind the door, we will divide it. And they agreed.",
        "A: Yeah, but -- was very smart. There were days when we couldn\u2019t take, we knew we can\u2019t\ntake because it was a very bad gendarme, and we didn\u2019t know what he will do at the -- at\nthe gate. And so there were days when we didn\u2019t take anything, and when we had the\nfeeling it will --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, we worked together --",
        "A. A: -- we worked together as a group. We worked together, we did\nentertaining together. As a matter of fact, the last -- on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1944, we\ndecided we will party, this is the end of the war, we -- two months and it\u2019s ended. And I\nthink we knew that the war is going bad for the Germans. So we decided -- we saw a\nroom and there was -- used to be a stove -- by that time, don\u2019t forget, after the transports\nin October, the ghetto was half empty, more than half we had a program.\nAnd I have the program, I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think I left 1t -- wrote 1t -- what\n[indecipherable] each two or one made a -- a -- a -- like a number performed, and we\ndidn\u2019t have anything to drink, but we were like drunk, because we said we\u2019ll be free, this\nis the year we will be free.\nQ. So you were there all night, partying.\nA. All night partying, yeah. Very quietly partyinh, nobody should hear.\nQ. Right.\nA. But we were together, we were very close knit group.\nQ. Right.\nA. But I think the others were, too, because I think it was a necessity, you have to work\ntogether, you couldn\u2019t do it on your own.",
        "A: Oh, some winnen -- women might have a argument that she threw down a piece of paper\non her place, or maybe, but we were so little in the room. And then I lived with my\nparents, there was no argument there, so --",

        "A: Martha -- Mama Dittel.",
        "A: Definitely, definitely.",
        "A: And I had my boyfriend that I looked forward to see. We did part, afterwards, but I had\nhim there, too, so -- and -- and I felt freer in one way, I had no -- the people that looked at\nus differently, I didn\u2019t meet the others. We were among ourselves only, I felt much freer.\nI felt better. And I felt that when it is over in two months, I have my room, and my bed,\nand our apartment and my parents. They are still home. I felt privileged that they\u2019re -- I\nwas -- by that time I was happy that they didn\u2019t come. But was the bubble blew and they\ncame, but --",
        "A: -- which was again, I was happy to see them, I was unhappy that they had to come. But at\nthat time, the first few months, I felt privileged that I have still my bed at home.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why the bed was so important, because I think the bunkbed wasn\u2019t very\ncomfortable.",

        "A: -- we -- my friend had scarlet fever, my other friend had typhoid fever, and I thought if I -\n- we slept together on the bunk so I might get it too, and then I can\u2019t get into transports.\nThe transports were hanging over you all the time. You would be rather sick than getting\ninto transport. But I never got it.",
        "A: No. There was diphtheria, there was encephalitis, there was hepatitis, there was scarlet\nfever. What else was there?",
        "A: Dysentery. I was always healthy. I think the vitamins did it. But 0 -- even in the\nbeginning when I didn\u2019t have them.",
        "A: Probably. Because in the end when we were liberated, friend of mine came as the first\ntransport that came, where we for the first time realized what happened, where we saw\nfor the first time -- we called them musselman, those devastated people that looked like\nskeleton. We tried to feed them. We were three girls that volunteered to -- immediately\nwe had to take care of them, and everybody was mobilized to do something for that\neffort. Forget the garden, and -- but s -- do something for these people. They cooked the\nsoup, but -- whatever they did, and they brought it and we were supposed to dish it out.\nAnd they all swamped around us, and the whole kettle and everything was down. We had\none girl that was like a general, and of course they broke another kettle and she screamed\nat them. They all -- you know, they were afraid of screaming. We didn\u2019t want to do that.\nWe got them -- she helped us to get it. We saw them like animals and -- and that was\nterrible for us. And with the first came -- the first women, there was my friend with her\nmother. And she was sick so she was in the -- in the teepho -- typhoid barracks. But it\nwas open, I could go in and out. So -- and she called for me and from the window I saw. I\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And she told me, I don\u2019t know, piece of bread or whatever. I\nran home and brought it, and I just walked into the typhoid hospital and I brought it to\nthem, you know, stuff. Then I went outs -- we had outside hothouses, you know, for stuff,\nand we had all this vegetables there, so I brought some veggies to them, something to\nnibble on, and nobody stopped me, could in and out as I wanted, and I did. And some\npeople got sick, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I -- I was not afraid to get sick and I d -- I -- I never thought I could get\nsick. When I think of it today when I have a little sense, it\u2019s different.",

        "A: Not there. I was always dreaming I\u2019m back at home. Because that was -- I -- I wanted my\nparents to keep the apart -- I wanted home, you know, we wanted to be liberated, and we\nthought life will continue where it stopped, but it didn\u2019t, and that was the biggest\ndisappointment, and it took out all the pleasure of being liberated --",

And then he took me over\nto them, he smuggled me in. Because nobody was allowed to come, but those boys that\nworked with the transport could, and he got me in. So I saw them still in the Schleusse,\nand immediately I put on my mother that I want them in the -- want her in Hamburger.\nMy brother and my father went to the barracks they were assigned to. My father -- I --\nimmediately there was a transport going to Poland, and I was afraid they would go, so\nimmediately my father contacted his friend who was on the Altestenrat, on the council of\nthe elders.",

I -- I don\u2019t know when the transport\nwent exactly, I could check on that. And he made sure he stayed, and then he gave him\nthe job to make order, to make sure. My father had a vision that if nobody steals from the\nmain -- I -- I stole from the Germans, but he didn\u2019t [indecipherable] stealing either. So\nstealing is stealing.",
        "A: No matter from whom. If -- as long as everybody will eat his portions, then these old\npeople that were dying would get enough food, too. There was some truth 1n it, but I\ndon\u2019t think he realized that maybe the young people need more food than the older one,\nand the kids need more food. He wanted justice for everyone, and he worked very hard\non that. But he was very generous. All of his friends and everybody got a good job there,\ntoo, as long as he could take care of them.",
        "A: There was the end. He went with the last transport when all the -- when all the -- the\nwhole f -- Alteste and everybody was gone, so he -- he couldn\u2019t stay any more. Zucker\nwas gone, and I don\u2019t know what happened, why he was taken. There was a group of 20\nyoung boys taken by Heindel, out. That\u2019s why they wanted me as a witness against\nHeindel. They were taken off the -- you know where you get on -- into the train. They\nwere not in the train, yet -- on the --",

And they took them to the small fortress and they were\nthe ones -- which I found -- we found only afterwards, and we found his name on the\nsmall fortress too, and they were the ones that had to clean out the crematorium from all\nthe urns, and throw them into the river. And last time when we were there, there is a\nmemorial for these 20 men, and where they threw down the -- the ashes into the river.\nAnd according to Elna Haas, he was about six weeks, and then they executed all of them,\nall 20.",

And because she was naked then -- and she said\nshe had so many children, that\u2019s why she -- she lost a lot of weight, and she survived.",

That was the\nmirror my father made for everyone.",

        "A: We knew that the Jews are suffering, that they are beaten and killed, and -- and we knew\nabout concentration camp. But there is still the belief that 1f you do and work hard, and\ndo what they say, they let you live. We didn\u2019t believe in mass extermination. We thought\nin masses 1s strength, and they can\u2019t kill hundred people at the same time. How dumb.\nThey could kill six million.",
        "A: But in front of us kids --",
        "A: -- they were always talking, it will be ending soon, you will have a normal life, you have\nto survive. Their aim was that their kids survive, they didn\u2019t care much about themselves.\nMy parents lost a lot of weight, even though we tried to bring and steal, they never take a\nthing, you know, from anywhere or anything. So we kids were the ones. My brother\nworked in the bakery and would bring additional bread, and -- which he would give his\npar -- our parents, and they lost a lot of weight. My father was a little belly, and you\nknow, he looked well-to-do, you will see it on the movie, and he was very skinny\nafterwards, and my mother too. And that went very fast. And I was bringing home the\nstuff, so you know, that didn\u2019t help, to [indecipherable] they were healthy people.\nOtherwise, there was nothing wrong with them. And they -- they considered themselves\nold, and lived their life, although they was only in their early 50\u2019s.",
        "A: Before the war?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah. She started with the Putzkolonne like Edgar\u2019s mother, like everyone. When new\npeople come they start the worst jobs because once you are there for a little while, you\nfind a way to find something better. My father didn\u2019t start on that note, he started in some\noffice or something. But my mother started in the Putzkolonne with washing floors, and -\n- and I don\u2019t know where they all cleaned, and I have no idea, because I was gone for the\nday. And then -- for a long time she was very handicapped with her -- she got a terrible\nattack of sciatica nerve and she couldn\u2019t -- she could only lay down, she couldn\u2019t move\nfor weeks. Because there was no medication, nothing, no pain killers, nothing. So only\ntime would heal. And then finally I -- she got onto a bed so she could rest better. And\nthen it stopped slowly, and she started to work. So for some time she was incapacitated.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, that -- I wasn\u2019t, because I believed in my father. We believed Father can do\nanything too, like my grandma.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And they also went together.",
        "A: Because of that --",
        "A: And at that time, I knew that if sh -- if I get her into -- there was a man that was\nresponsible, Edgar wanted me to tell you, for the agriculture, his name was Kurzawy. He\nwas not an SS, and he was really very good to us. When the SS came he was -- he would\ncall us all dirty names, and scream at us, and when the SS went he would said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s\nnormal again.\u201d You know? He would always protect us if he could. He was a great guy.\nIn 1945, he was imprisoned like all the Germans, in the small fortress, and the agriculture\ngroup got together and signed a petition and we got him out. And he ended up his life in\nAustria. But he was great, so I thought maybe I -- my sister-in-law sometimes worked in\nhis pri -- private garden in his house, it was outside the ghetto. So I thought we -- I could\nget my mother in to be protected, but my mother wouldn\u2019t let me, she said, \u201cAh, you are -\n- your father and me, we are together. We will go through this together. You have been\nhere before alone, you can survive again, and you have to survive.\u201d And she wouldn\u2019t\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: -- she wouldn\u2019t s -- try to save herself, no. And I tried to get in, but they wouldn\u2019t take us.\nWe were 29 girls that appealed to everyone we could, including Murmelstein, who threw\nus out very rudely, that wanted to make a swap, 15 girls take in and 15 parents take out,\nyou know, swap it, it\u2019s number for number. No. Because it was a rule that we have to\nbring in the harvest, that -- and that what Kurzawy did. None of his girls were allowed to\nbe send away. He needs them for harvest, and that he saved everyone.",
        "A: I think he did it -- I don\u2019t think he cared, I don\u2019t believe that he cared. I think he did what\nwas the order from the commandant.",
        "A: And the order was not to send anybody who works in the fields.",
        "A: And [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. So I think that was his, and as a matter of fact, Kurzawy told me -- I went to him\ntoo, and he will talk to us. But he said, \u201cYou wi -- you won\u2019t be with your mother, and\nyou will be grateful to me that I saved your life.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cI don\u2019t ask you for\nthat. I want to go.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou will not go.\u201d That was the end. So then in February\ncame a Swiss transport. And I happened to be in the Swiss transport ti -- again. By that\ntime [indecipherable] could go, that was already the end coming. And I decided if he\ndidn\u2019t let me go with my parents, I\u2019m not leaving Terezin because my parents will come\nback to Terezin. I don\u2019t want to be somewhere in Switzerland. Besides, it\u2019s probably goes\nto the sent -- to Birkenau. Birkenau we knew -- to Birkenau two, and I do -- I\u2019m not\ngoing anywhere now. So I went to Kurzawy and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to Switzerland, I\u2019m\ntelling you.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, I want to stay.\u201d He said, \u201cYou can stay.\u201d And I\nstayed. Took me out of the transport. But that went to Switzerland",
        "A: That really went, but I didn\u2019t trust them any more.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Kurzawy, not Heindel. Heindel would never --",
        "A: -- talk to us.",
        "A: Kurzawy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think we understood that it\u2019s very bad on the other side. What we didn\u2019t know, and I\ndidn\u2019t know that he was in sh -- Auschwitz once, that he was there, he saw what\nhappening.",
        "A: He knew, but I didn\u2019t know it until my sister-in-law told me years later that he was sent\nto Auschwitz as one of the transports, and he saw.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when he decided to save his groups, and his -- the girls he worked with, I\nthink. We think, we don\u2019t know.",
        "A: It\u2019s very bad there, there\u2019s --",
        "A: -- you know, much more hunger, there 1s much more -- we knew that.",
        "A: And it\u2019s under the SS --",
        "A: -- very, very bad, you know. And we knew that the camps were worse -- the ghettos in --\nLodz ghetto was much worse sanitary and everything, that we knew. Everybody was\nafraid of the east, because the Polish people suffered before the war, with pogroms. They\ndidn\u2019t need the war for that.",
        "A: But nobody believed that --",
        "A: -- somebody can do such a thing to human beings.",
        "A: To children.",
        "A: To young people, old people. Nobody believed it. I was so upset when grandma died\nbecause I thought it\u2019s my fault, I should have taken better care of her, which I didn\u2019t\nknow what to do, how I would have been able, because they were dying at that time, the -\n- the book it says 220, I thought about 150 a day in \u201942, in summer. That was the worst\nsummer for death rate in Terezin. And after the war I said I\u2019m so grateful that she did,\nbecause they schlepped the old people to Auschwitz, they died on the way in the train.\nShe was spared that, she died in a bed. You know? And she was 86 or 88, I don\u2019t know.\nSo for her it was a good deed. But I -- we knew it\u2019s very bad, that we knew. Why would\neverybody fight not to go?",
        "A: Terezin wasn\u2019t a bargain.",
        "A: The gas chamber we didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t know that 50 is old. My mother said, \u201cLook, I am strong, I am still good\nenough to work, I can work hard and I\u2019ll come back.\u201d She didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Was too old.",
        "A: We went to anything we could get our hands on tickets, or whatever they get. I saw\nBrundibar. I saw Bartibride. I saw all -- some operas.",
        "A: No, that one I didn\u2019t see.",
        "A: \u201cCarmen\u201d I saw. I saw -- I went to nearly any concert [indecipherable] to get on Alice\nSommer-Herz, which was the pianist I loved so much.",
        "A: Alice Sommer-Herz. She\u2019s the hundred year old one, and -- and --",
        "A: -- I would listen to her, because sh -- to -- she played the Mozart, she played Chopin, and\nI loved that. So I would try to get to these concerts, but they were not only concert -- as a\nmatter of fact, we did some recitals of poems, because a guy, usually George Loy put us,\nabout six girls together, and we recite, just to do something, because we couldn\u2019t sing.\nBut that wasn\u2019t too -- too successful --",
        "A: -- cause people didn\u2019t listen to poems too much, so after short while it -- 1t stopped\n[indecipherable]. But we wanted to do things, because that -- that took away the\nboredom.",
        "A: With your ghetto gelt.",
        "A: Actual money that you get for your work. We played Monopoly. My sister-in-law made\nMonopoly board, I don\u2019t know where she got the cardboard, and with this money we\nplayed Monopoly sometimes.",
        "A: Yeah. But I don\u2019t know what happened to it. She said all she has left is about two\ncalendars that she made for birthdays. You get -- you -- you paid with something, like\ntomatoes, and you -- she made you a -- you know, a something else, and the person made\nyou whatever you ordered.",
        "A: I have a pendant that I got in \u201943 on my birthday.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we have it with us. Edgar didn\u2019t show you his pendant in those pictures. He\nhas one too, different. It has his -- his number, transport number in the Akar, and mine\nhas my transport number and the date on it. It\u2019s from scrap metal, it\u2019s not silver --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s not gold, it\u2019s just [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was always full.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how many people go twice or three times. Because it was also hard to get\ntickets, there was too many people that wanted to go, because that was -- for the two\nhours, an hour and a half, you forgot you were where you were. The music was -- well,\nI\u2019m not a musician, but I's -- would say perfect. That was -- anywhere else the concert\ncould be held, and would be great. She was a great pianist, so you know, I\u2019m not a good -\n- maybe somebody would say the piano wasn\u2019t tuned very well, but -- and there were too\n-- big competition, you -- sometimes you knew somebody who could get the tickets or\nyou -- you really bargained for that, but you got tickets, you went. I don\u2019t remember how\nit was later, because in the beginning you also had to be eight o\u2019clock home. Whether for\nFreizeit we were allowed, because this was all evenings.",
        "A: The free --",
        "A: No, Freizeit means that was the free entertainment, or whatever --",
        "A: -- you know, and that you got permission to go later out, I don\u2019t know, but I know that\nthere was a -- from eight to five, you were not allowed to be on the streets, but you had to\nget home from those performances, so that might have been allowed.",
        "A: No, there was electricity.",
        "A: Electricity. There was only no heat. There was no heat or hot water. I don\u2019t know how\nthey had it in the kitchen, but in the washroom, where Edgar ad -- des-described it, where\nwe went every night to wash, and sit under --",
        "A: -- the cold water --",
        "A: -- yeah, there was no hot water there.",
        "A: No, you -- you jumped onto the [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- and sat down and opened the pipe, and -- and that was your shower. There was no\nshower.",
        "A: We had towels from home, sure. That was in the hun -- 50 kilos, in the 110 pounds. You\nhad towels, you had bed linen in that.",
        "A: Only the big things you could send out to be washed, like the bed linen and the towels.\nYour -- your things, you washed in the cold water. You had a basin that you shared.\n[indecipherable]",

        "A: Wherever you could.",
        "A: Yeah, it would be --",
        "A: So you didn\u2019t wash that day.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how we did it. I don\u2019t know things of ordinary, we didn\u2019t have paper, we\ndidn\u2019t have pencils, only what you brought in. But then those people that work with it,\nthe painters, they got it, they might have, you know, some may k -- have come to their\nfriends, or again exchanged the barter system.",
        "A: But paper was very valuable.",
        "A: There was no toilet paper, I don\u2019t remember ever getting a ration.",
        "A: And any hygiene, there was no hygiene. But we all ar-are s -- young girls, did not have\nperiod for those three years.",
        "A: You entered the ghetto, it stopped.",
        "A: No, it stopped in the ghetto.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: -- which was lucky, because we had no way of getting --",
        "A: -- anything. It started only when we came back to Prague. I don\u2019t know when, I mean --",
        "A: -- never thought about that.",
        "A: Well, evidently. Which we didn\u2019t think of at that time. We just forgot about it\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, it was the first three or four weeks and nothing happened --",
        "A: -- and that was it. You didn\u2019t worry about health those days, we were young, we thought\nwe are -- nothing can touch us.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: The most impact, the most -- because we -- I at least knew what they are singing about\nbecause my friend told me. She was singing for us, she was with Schecter. She knew\nwhat [indecipherable], and I took Latin in school, don\u2019t forget I went to school from --",
        "A: -- sixth grade I had Latin. So I knew what libera may mean, e-even if I didn\u2019t understand\nevery word, and couldn\u2019t translate it for anybody, I didn\u2019t know that much.",
        "A: It was very powerful.",
        "A: I thought I am back in Prague in a concert scene. So [indecipherable]. You -- you forget\nwhere you are that -- those two hours, you -- you hear the music, you hear the concerts,\nyou hear the opera [indecipherable] it was only singing, there was no acting, there was no\nstage. I mean, there was a stage where they s -- were standing and the piano and only\nsinging. And you were back in the National Theater hearing the opera. I mean all in am --\nimagination was great.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: I think so because it -- somehow our -- my friend told me what the meaning is, to tell\nthem that they will suffer. In the end, truth will win somehow, and we wanted to believe\nthat. You know it was very interesting, I thought I could kill any SS with cold blooded. In\n\"45 when they started -- when they marched them, they were torn, they were dirty, they\nwere not these spic, span with these high boots SS. I suddenly didn\u2019t hate them so much,\nI couldn\u2019t. They looked so vulnerable. I don\u2019t think I could have killed anybody, and --\neven though I thought I could.",
        "A: In some way they looked worse than we did. But in 1947 I went to England, and on the\nway back, I -- I brought some oranges. I had a one year old nephew, my brother had a\nchild with my sister-in-law, my friend. And on the all -- the all -- we went through\nNuremberg which was all destroyed, and I enjoyed that very much. And under -- in the\nstation we stopped, and I had these oranges, and chocolate in my trunk that my friend -- I\ncalled her cousin, gave me for everybody. And they were begging for food, those\nchildren. And I said, \u201cNo way do I give you German children anything.\u201d Like if those\nkids murdered all the others, but I could look at them begging for food, and I didn\u2019t feel\nguilty at all. And I know I was awful, I know I -- I\u2019m biased all my life, and not good, but\nI just couldn\u2019t get rid of it at that time, \u201947 was too early after the war. Now I am\ndifferent.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because our group again, being put anywhere we\u2019re needed, was put on the\nmain square to do the grass. And it was all done, we had to clear everything away, new\nearth had to come. There was nothing, there was just mud and stones. We had to clear it\nof stones, which was heavy work, several times. The earth had to be brought in and\nturned over, and put in lime and stuff that -- to grass to grow. And then we had to seed it,\nand then we had to stamp it by -- by -- see, we worked days and days and days on\nfershernerone we called it beautification. And then when they did the film, we had to\nmarch because we -- we looked healthy, because we had the vegetables. We had to march\nwith our hoes, and shovels on our shoulder. And march in front of the camera, and pick\nup the cake, and then behind the corner, we had to put the cake back on, and a new tray\nwas brought in. Nobody could take a bite. That was just a little something that we had to\npick up.",
        "A: That Hitler made -- Hitler gave a ghetto to -- a city to the Jews, or whatever.",

        "A: Maybe they didn\u2019t put it in, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, maybe they didn\u2019t put it in, it might be it\u2019s lost. I wouldn\u2019t know.",

        "A: We knew what they are doing.",
        "A: The shops were being introduced, the shops were being staffed. My mother was put in the\nfood shop, where she was selling mustard and relish, that\u2019s all they had. But it was a\nchange, I loved mustard and bread, and that was the [indecipherable] delicacy.",
        "A: Yes, they -- yes, yes --",
        "A: -- it was -- it -- 1t took time to establish that it took time till the grass grew.",
        "A: Then we had to cut it to -- to -- you know, to make sure it looks good.",
        "A: Have the flower planted too, flowers. There were -- 1t was made beautiful. They were\nputting up -- one space was for the gazebo for the musicians or something. And on the\nday of the inspection, I was in the fields working, I was not in town. We were rarely in\ntown during the day, because once the grass grew and was finished, we went back to the\nfields, cause those had to be taken care of, and the summer is still most work. So on the\nday of th -- I never saw the --",
        "A: -- people, the Red Cross or anybody.",
        "A: It was a restricted area, it was in the middle of the town, and I don\u2019t know when the shops\nopened exactly, but once they were opened, I think you could go in. I don\u2019t think -- I\ndon\u2019t know how early before that they opened it, but in the ghetto, was no restricted area.\nI have no idea how it was during the exi -- actual inspection, whether they restricted the\nmain street where they walked, because I was outside.",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: Until they were deported, I stayed in the room with them.",
        "A: My brother next house. When they -- by the time they left, in the last transport, there was\nnobody in the house, I was all alone in the whole house.",
        "A: And my sister-in-law was in another house around the corner, and she was alone, too. So\nfirst we moved in together. I moved over there, I -- I didn\u2019t want to stay in -- in that\nroom, I -- I had nightmares, I was -- I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, I was afraid to stay there\nalone. I tried to save few of the things. When you went to Auschwitz, you were allowed\nyour backpack and what you can carry, no more a trunk, that stayed all with me, the three\ntrunks. My brother\u2019s things too. And then the agriculture department opened a house\nright opposite where we had the place where we gathered for work. And my sister-in-law\nimmediately, through her supervisor, got a room for us there. So we were five girls that\nmoved in into that house in one room. I don\u2019t remember the fifth, my sister-in-law says\nwe were five, I remember only four.",
        "A: Until they weren\u2019t.",
        "A: They all went, and I knew there is no help by that time.",
        "A: Because once my father says, \u201cWe have to go,\u201d I knew that.",
        "A: He left on a different transport, and my sister-in-law says they got married the day before,\nI thought always they got married the same day he left. That was a period of time when\nme and my sister-in-law were jealous of each other. She\u2019s 18, I am 20. So, you know, you\ndon\u2019t -- 21 -- you don\u2019t --",

        "A: You -- not that --",
        "A: -- that didn\u2019t bother me, mi -- married my father -- my brother, not anybody I wanted. But\nshe would claim my brother more, and she would claim that she knows him better. Now I\nlived with him, he was a little baby, I know him better. So in Terezin we were bickering\nto, and fighting, and all that. When we came back and my brother returned, he was not in\na very good condition that time, because he weigh like 90 pounds, 80 pounds, he was\nvery skinny. He had the boils like Edgar. Didn\u2019t look very good. But the first thing he\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear my wife what she says, and I don\u2019t want to hear you. We are\nnow the only family [indecipherable] and you will get along. And that\u2019s it, don\u2019t come to\nme.\u201d So we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: We got along, we had to get along, but not willingly. We love each other now, and I\u2019m so\nhappy when I see -- have to see each other every year at least. She was just here now. So\nshe left Monday, the day you came here.",
        "A: He was deported --",
        "A: -- in the third transport, we -- we separated.",
        "A: Before, because I wasn\u2019t ready to be a true fianc\u00e9 or whatever. I wasn\u2019t really ready for it.\nAnd he wanted more experience, let\u2019s put it that way, as a boy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So we separated, but we didn\u2019t fight. And when he -- he came to tell me he is in a\ntransport, this is in \u00b044, when they all were leaving in the third transport, and will I would\naccompany him to the Schleusse, and I said, \u201cYes, I'll go with you.\u201d And his last word --\nwords were, wait for me. But we were not going together, what do I\u2019m waiting for? His\nmother stayed, his father went, too. And we were very good friends, she came to visit us\nin Israel, his mother.",
        "A: He was an oldest child, he was a terrible --",
        "A: -- terrible loss to her. She stayed in Terezin, we were there, because she worked in the\nmica, and those people were also safe because that was war effort. So she stayed till the\nend, too, like I did.",
        "A: We knew what\u2019s going on, but I just wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t ready, not in camp, and not under those conditions. That\u2019s not for me.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we knew that, that there were plenty of girls who were willing, go ahead. I had\nbetter ideas about my life.",
        "A: No. I just wasn\u2019t ready in the [indecipherable]. I wasn\u2019t ready because I don\u2019t think my\nparents would approve.

We never\ntalked about sex or anything like that, but I thought she wouldn\u2019t approve, so -- not just\ncasual, I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Even some of my friends.",
        "A: And they knew it.",
        "A: They were neve -- not in love somebody, it was just the present that counted, and\nsomebody e-else can come afterwards, and I wasn\u2019t that type, I couldn\u2019t do that.",

        "A: I did not judge them, no, I did not judge them.",
        "A: That\u2019s their way of life. My best friend was that way. She told me about it, she told me\nI\u2019m stupid.",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t take advantage of the --",
        "A: -- free -- of being free, not even having parents. She had her mother there, and I -- I just --\nI don\u2019t know. I -- I wasn\u2019t mature enough. I think I was too yo-young, even though in age\nI was older.",
        "A: By this time I am 20 - 21. And so today 21, that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- old. I mean, you know, I just wasn\u2019t mature for that. I did not think that -- I -- I wanted\nrelationship, but something that I can value, and that wasn\u2019t there.",

        "A: Edgar says I was stupid. He says I was stupid till I got married. He had always said I was\nstupid as a young kid. I don\u2019t know, you know, I respected my parents very much, and all\nmy life, I just wanted to be the person they wanted me to be.",
        "A: The -- it was very important to me, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But I think -- I always said to Edgar, it would be different -- because I had my s -- my\nfights with my parents, I wanted things that they said no.

So we f -- I had fights with my parents, I wasn\u2019t the -- just\nthe cream of a relationship. But they died so tragically. I couldn\u2019t do anything for them,\nto help them.

Because I believed strongly that they will\ncome back. For me it was a shock. For whatever, my parents will come back, my father\nknows what to do. He will help Mother, and he will -- he always -- he survived World\nWar I, he will survive this war. So I was -- I believed my father be powerful, and -- which\nhe wasn\u2019t. You know?

We went to the firm whether my\nfather wouldn -- get something from like pension or something that he paid, but of\ncourse, we were over 21, so there was nothing we could get. And the -- the insurance\ncompany wanted death certificate. We couldn\u2019t explain to them we don\u2019t have death\ncertificates, they died in a camp. So we had to go to the court and declare them deceased,\nand that took six months. And then we got o-officially death certificate. And I don\u2019t\nknow whether that made me believe. I don\u2019t think I wanted ever to believe that they are\ndead. And then we went to the insurance company, and then they told us, well the\nGermans took their life insurances and everything. It\u2019s in Germany. So we wrote to\nGermany nec -- to the company, and they said give us proof. They wouldn\u2019t give us the\nproof, and they didn\u2019t believe us, so that was lost.

        "A: We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know that, or we didn\u2019t want to know it, and didn\u2019t think about it.",
        "A: Yeah, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think once I met Edgar, and we started new life, and then really, I think that was for me\ngood life. That was what --",
        "A: -- | wanted from the beginning. I didn\u2019t want a career, I wanted a family. So I worked\nbecause I have to support myself. I didn\u2019t think of working myself up or something, that\nwasn\u2019t important. Important was to have family.",
        "A: So my brother said -- I said, if I don\u2019t have a kid by -- or something by 25, I\u2019m going to\ndo it without the husband. My mother, you know?",
        "A: Ahead of the time. So my brother joked that, \u201cI think somebody will sacrifice himself, I\nput an ad in the newspaper.\u201d I was determined to have it one way or the other. I was\ndetermined.",
        "A: I wanted a family, but if I can\u2019t have it, \u20191l make my own family.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I needed it.",
        "A: You know, some people are [indecipherable] they don\u2019t even want a partner or anything,\nbecause it -- it\u2019s -- you have to adjust to a partner, too, and all that, so they don\u2019t want to\ndo it. But for me that was important.",
        "A: After -- after the war.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so any more, no.",
        "A: Even in Israel -- in Israel I was dreaming we are in Prague, want to get out, and can\u2019t, and\nEdgar is 1n Israel, how will we get together. Things being separated, so I had dreams\nabout that. But I think that stopped already.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And can\u2019t get out.",
        "A: Always this can\u2019t get out.",
        "A: Or after we ran away, that I am back in Czechoslovakia and can\u2019t get out.",
        "A: That -- that did happen, yes.",
        "A: I dreamt of a --",
        "A: -- yes, I dreamt that I found them in a hospital in Poland. I -- I dreamt that they came su-\nsuddenly back. I wouldn\u2019t even know how they would find me, because we didn\u2019t have a\ncommon address --",
        "A: -- or anything where to find me, but you don\u2019t think about these things.",
        "A: And till today when I think about my parents, I see them the way they were in their 50\u2019s.\nI have no idea how they would age.",
        "A: Nobody until Edgar.",
        "A: Until he wanted to know what I did, or something, no. And until the 90\u2019s, nobody wanted\nto hear. People I worked with for 25, didn\u2019t even know I was in a camp.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were young people that were born here and they didn\u2019t know it.",
        "A: Well then that --",
        "A: That was in \u201978?",
        "A: I think that\u2019s when people started to get so in -- I thought it was in 80 - something, so I\nthought that\u2019s when people start to be interested. And that\u2019s when they started to ask\nquestions, yes, after that movie. That was a serial, and that --",
        "A: -- that -- that was anyhow fiction, that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- not a true story.",
        "A: I saw it, and I thought, that isn\u2019t true.",
        "A: Terrible.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I think what happened to us is that we found out that being quiet is\nharmful, people should know that as we are dying out, there are coming more and more\npeople that will say it never happened.",
        "A: It\u2019s fiction, it\u2019s imagination. And in memory of all those that died, that 1t should be\nknown and so I can talk.",
        "A: No, because I am not a public speaker.",
        "A: I am very conscious of my accent.",
        "A: It\u2019s terrible.",
        "A: When I heard myself on the tape the first time, I said, I sound like [indecipherable]",
        "A: On the tape I do.",
        "A: And I get embarrassed in front of all people. I -- you know, this is fine, I can do this any\ntime. And besides, I already feel I know you, since yesterday and feel very comfortable\nwith all of you here. But total strangers, I -- I have difficulty, and Edgar can do it with a\nthousand people, he doesn\u2019t mind, and he will joke, and he\u2019s witty, I am not. I can\u2019t joke\nabout it. When he gets embarrassed he jokes more. [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t -- besi -- and again, I don\u2019t have what to tell in the schools, it\u2019s not such a\ninteresting story like his. Comes back to that.",
        "A: I know, but you know, especially the way Terezin is pictured now as a paradise for the\nJews. So -- what should I tell them?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: For anyone. And that\u2019s where I have the difficulty, take people back there, because the\npsychological, the fright when it came transport is going, new transport 1s collecting.\nWho is going to go, which friend is going to be in it? Will I be in it? Where 1s it going?\nThat -- that psychological -- that cloud was over you all the time. All those years, up to\nthe end we didn\u2019t know when a transport is going, until the Red Cross came. Because one\nthing we were afraid of all that, what will the end be like? Will they shoot us all? Now we\nare such a small group here, they have it much easier. Will they let us survive? And when\nwe heard the stories that they did not let the people survive, the last day they were\nshooting them, I don\u2019t think they would -- if they have time would have not be willing to\ndo it to Terezin, too. So that was -- we were always afraid of the end, even though we\nwere in Terezin, the end was for us a mystery. And we thought in masses is strength, that\nthey can\u2019t kill 50,000 people, but we learned that they could, so --",
        "A: You are saying it\u2019s going on again --",
        "A: -- and it\u2019s everywhere, and still in the world. And I feel that humans do it to themselves.\nYou know, I couldn\u2019t believe in God afterwards, because my mother was such a angel,\nand my father helping everybody, how could they be killed? And the rabbi, I don\u2019t even\nknow his name, I don\u2019t know where he came from, I met him somewhere where I was.\nAnd I told him I don\u2019t believe because He let my parents be killed, and who were so\ngood. And he said to me, \u201cWhat do you think God looks like? Do you think he\u2019s there\nlike a puppeteer, moving his finger and saying this one die, this one live? God gave\nhumans brain. Humans are doing this to humans. He\u2019s not guilty, he\u2019s trying to make you\na better human. You believe in Him, you believe in good.\u201d",
        "A: I think humans that -- are doing it to themselves. I don\u2019t think that -- I think it\u2019s in -- it\u2019s -\n- they are animals. If a man can kill a little baby and go home and hug his own baby, how\ncan he do it? And that\u2019s what the SS did. So they are not humans to me, they are just\nanimals. And I can\u2019t even treat animals badly, because they have feelings and pain; and\nthey could, so they are worse than animals.",
        "A: No, they are still doing it. They are doing it still all over the world.",
        "A: It is, but I don\u2019t know how to repair it, I\u2019m not that clever. Education, education, but what\nhappened in Israel? The kids are educated to hate each other, the kids are educated to\nfight, th -- th -- it\u2019s -- they get hatred with their mother\u2019s milk. And it won\u2019t be good until\nthey change that. And I don\u2019t think it will be for our generation to see. Maybe these\nterrible atrocities and terrible wars can change the generation of my grandchildren, that\nthey get some sense, and say violence doesn\u2019t pay, and shouldn\u2019t be. Our generation\nwouldn\u2019t do it.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome.",
        "A: Sometimes.",
        "A: There are parts of -- even during the war when we were happy. I cherish, I think for life,\nall the friendships I made there, and we are still writing, even if we can\u2019t see each other,\nwe are all over the world. This -- and I think those friendships, and those -- that closeness\ncannot be replaced, and cannot be achieved later. The circumstances were such that you\nbecame close, and that\u2019s a great feeling to have such friends.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: This is my grandfather, Gustav Krasa, who died sometime in 1923, so I have really never\nmet him. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s father. She was a born Krasa.",
        "A: This is my grandmother, Johanna, born strassa -- Krasa, who died much earlier, in 1913.",
        "A: This is my father Oskar Fuchs, and my mother, ro -- Rosa Fuchs, and my brother, their\nfirstborn, Yearje, which means George.",

        "A: I think I was about three here, maybe two and a half, something like that.",
        "A: This one is again me and my brother, I think about two years older, maybe four I am\nhere.",
        "A: This is my mother, Rosele, and me and my brother.",
        "A: My brother and me. I have to be about six to seven because I got my new teeth, front\nteeth. So I would judge first or second grade.",
        "A: This one is going to first grade. We did not have kindergarten in our times like here. I\nwas very proud to get the school bag, and I wanted a picture with it.",
        "A: My brother was older, he was already being in third grade.",
        "A: That\u2019s my brother in -- going to first grade. And because he had the picture with his\nschool bag, I wanted it too, when I went.",
        "A: This is me, but I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s fifth grade, or -- probably before going to\ngimnasium or something like that.",
        "A: This is around 1940, when we started to wear stars. Both my friend and me went to get\npictures.",
        "A: This is my friend, Ollie Dupe, who perished with the 5,000 Czech Jews on March\nseventh, 1944, in Auschwitz.",
        "A: No, this --",
        "A: This is diff -- this is a picture on the same day, but she perished on -- on that March --\nthat\u2019s not -- that\u2019s \u00b044, we were not taking pictures any more.",

        "A: Well, this is my friend Ollie, and me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Me. We were pretty inseparable certain times before I was transported away. Eva was\nalready gone, so we were inseparable.",
        "A: Yeah. This is during those groups. She was in the same group as me.",
        "A: This is Ollie and her brother Gusta Dupe, and Dolphie Reeshnofsky, we were in a group,\nand he -- Dolphie was the one who wrote the play and directed the play, this is from the\nplay.",
        "A: This is Dolphie Reeshnofsky. That\u2019s Gusta Dupe, and that\u2019s her, Olive Dupe.",
        "A: This is me, in the play, famous play that we performed for our parents. And that\u2019s Gusta\nDupe as a magician or a wizard or something. And I\u2019m begging him, I don\u2019t know what\nfor.",
        "A: I had my -- there was a dress I had, and the co -- we made the costumes. We made\neverything for the play. We had several plays. I -- and I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t separate them.",
        "A: This is again from another play, were Ollie Dupe and Dolphie Reeshnofsky.",

        "A: Either 86 or 88.",
        "A: This is a shot after the liberation, when we all left. This is my former supervisor from\nhead of our group, Wilma Shick, standing. Sitting is a very close friend of mine, Ene\nVetrovska, one of those that was not allowed to steal. And they stayed on after liberation\nto harvest and work the gardens, while we all left.
