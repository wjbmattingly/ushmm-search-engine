        "Q: Today is April 9, 1992, Iam Anthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Mrs.\nFrances Zatz of North Woodmere, New York. I am here on behalf of the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview Mrs. Zatz about her experiences\nduring the Holocaust. Good morning.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Warsaw.",
        "Q: In Warsaw, Poland?",
        "A: Warsaw, Poland, right.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: In 1932, May 4\".",
        "Q: Were you an only child?",
        "A: I was not, I had a younger sister, four years younger than myself. Her name is\nEileen. She lives not too far from me here and we see each other very frequently.",
        "Q: What was your name when you were a Polish girl in Poland?",
        "A: Frania. Everybody called me Frania and I\u2019m being called by my friends that\nknow me from Europe still Frania.",
        "Q: And your family name?",
        "A: Prawer. That was pronounced Praver. Praver in Polish.",
        "Q: What kind of home did you live in Warsaw?",
        "A: Well, our first home that I recollect, which was a very tiny apartment, on Nilefke\n(?). We lived over there for awhile until my mother gave birth to my sister and I\nguess the apartment became too small and we moved to Moronovska 2 (?), and\n1\nwe lived there even while the ghetto started to be built. The Wall, which\nhappened to have been on the corner.",
        "Q: What kind of apartment was it?",
        "A: Very small rooms, but they were like two small bedrooms, a living room and\nanother little room where my parents worked. They used to do ladies lingerie,\nlike piecework. They used to bring it home every morning and work until late at\nnight, and if they finished making the lingerie they would fold it up, put it in\nboxes and deliver them to a certain place where I suppose they paid them rather\nwell. Because from what I can recall now, that couldn\u2019t have been a very cheap\napartment. It was a brand new building when we moved in, it was a corner\nbuilding, we were on the fourth floor and everyone had a window, so I remember\nit being a lovely apartment.",
        "Q: Was your father in business for himself or was he producing for retail outlets?",
        "A: It was together with my mother. They worked together in the house. They had\nmachines and I remember them working until late hours at night. You know\nputting out their certain quotas that they used to bring in.",
        "Q: So they would make lingerie which would then be brought to stores, which would\nthen be sold.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that they brought it to the stores themselves, they brought it back to\nthe people who gave them the pre-cut pieces. They just put them together, folded\nthem up and put them in the boxes and delivered them back to the places. I\nsuppose a factory or a warehouse and they, on the other hand, would sell it to the\nstores who sold it to clients.",
        "Q: How would you describe the religious life of your family?",
        "A: We were not religious. I remember Polish and Yiddish being spoken in the house.\nI don\u2019t even remember, too well, observing any of the holidays too well. I do not\nrecollect any specifics except for some minute little things, I guess it must have\nbeen maybe like Chanukah I would receive some gifts and I was told it was a\nJewish holiday, and I was told also there was a holiday, of course now I realize it\nwas Passover, where we couldn\u2019t eat bread. But, I didn\u2019t remember it too well. I\nremember eating something else beside bread. So this is all I have a recollection\nof actual holidays.",
        "Q: Both of your parents were Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So you would describe them as secular?\n2",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Jewish but secular.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Were both of your parents born in Warsaw\u2019?",
        "A: No. My father was born in Warsaw, my mother was born in Kovrin (?), in a small\ntown.",
        "Q: What were their names, your parents\u2019 names?",
        "A: My mother was always called Toby. I guess in every language it\u2019s still Toby. My\nfather was called, my mother had a name for him Srulik (?), she used to call him.\nHis Jewish name was Israel. I remember this mostly as Srulik I remember my\nmother calling his names. That\u2019s why this name was more outstanding than\nwhatever else other people called him. And his sisters in Israel also when they\ntalked about him it\u2019s always Srulik. That\u2019s how he was known. I guess it\u2019s an\nabbreviation of Israel.",
        "Q: What kinds of schools did you attend in Warsaw?",
        "A: I did not go to any school. I never had a chance to go to school because the war\nbroke out, but my father gave me some education. We used to sit, he used to\nteach me how to read and write and I used to have to spend a certain amount of\ntime everyday looking, if it was an old book, or if 1t was just a page from\nsomething, whatever was readable material he made sure that I know how to read\nand write.",
        "Q: In Polish?",
        "A: In Polish only. Yes.",
        "Q: So you could read and write Polish and you could understand Yiddish?",
        "A: Well, Yiddish I learned actually in the United States.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t understand Yiddish.",
        "A: I did not know a word of Yiddish until I came to this country and my mother\nmade me learn Yiddish because it was the only way she could correspond with me\nhere. She did not allow me to speak Polish in this country. She did not know too\nwell English, which I caught on within one year. I spoke English when I came\nhere, and for her it was more difficult and she used to speak Yiddish most of the\n3\ntime to all her friends and I guess in no time I learned the language and she would\ntalk to me in Yiddish and I would answer back in English or half Polish until after\nawhile I learned the language well.",
        "Q: Did you know your grandparents?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father, he came once, I remember seeing him once. He was a tall\nman with a beard. It must have been a special occasion and I think I wasn\u2019t more\nmaybe than three or four years old. It must have been my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nwedding when I saw him, was the only time I saw him. My grandmother died\nafter she gave birth to my mother\u2019s youngest brother, and my father\u2019s side, I don\u2019t\nremember a grandfather at all, but I do remember a grandmother, my father\u2019s\nmother living around the corner from us when we lived on Moronovska (?). It\nwas walking distance, but the woman was paralyzed. She lived there with my\nfather\u2019s oldest brother. His name was Shlamik (?), and she was in the last\nbedroom and I remember my father said every week we have to go and see\ngrandma. So that\u2019s , I remember just seeing her being ill in bed. She probably\nmust have had polio, I imagine.",
        "Q: Did you have any hobbies or pets when you were growing up?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What did you want to be when you grew up?",
        "A: Alive.",
        "Q: You wanted to be alive?",
        "A: Just to be alive. I was grateful. Nothing else and just to make sure there\u2019s always\nenough food. Never to go hungry again.",
        "Q: Before the war was up, did you have any ---?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember too much from before the war. I was just a child playing. I had\nsome toys. Since one of my mother\u2019s sisters had a booth in a market, I guess it\nwas like a flea market at that time. Like an indoor flea market and she had a\nbooth. She would sell toys so she used to bring me certain things I would play\nwith and she told me not to break them because they would be resold tomorrow.\nNaturally I could never keep anything, but I played with a lot of things and then\nshe would carefully put them back in boxes and sold them.",
        "Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends before the war?",
        "A: No. I remember also as I\u2019m talking to you, my biggest love, I remember, I was\nfive or maybe six or even younger, my father taking me to the movies to see\n4\nShirley Temple. I fell in love with her and at that time I used to go to see every\nShirley Temple movie.",
        "Q: So you liked to see movies?",
        "A: I loved to see movies, especially with Shirley Temple. They were the only\nmovies I ever saw was only when Shirley Temple appeared. Which, I guess, must\nhave been once a year or whenever",
        "Q: Were these dubbed?",
        "A: Yes, they were dubbed.",
        "Q: Were there any other films that you liked?",
        "A: I never saw any other films. Those were the only ones. I must have seen maybe\ntwo or three Shirley Temple movies and they used to sell outside, when you\nwalked out of the movie theater, they used to sell little rings with her photograph\nthat used sort of flash like she would smile on those little pictures on the ring.\nThat was my biggest treasure.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the thirties when you were growing up?",
        "A: No. No, ,none whatsoever. I didn\u2019t know the meaning of it even.",
        "Q: Would you say you had a rather protected or rather sheltered life?",
        "A: Yes. Very sheltered. I was very secure. I was a very happy child and having a\nlittle sister, you know, made my life complete, I guess. Somebody to play with.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t particularly dream of having a baby brother?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Would you say your parents were easy going or strict?",
        "A: Very easy going.",
        "Q: If it had been possible, you would have loved growing up in your house in\nWarsaw?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. It was very comfortable. I remember my relatives living very close\nby and we used to gather rather frequently. Visit each other. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat days or what evenings, but we were always not so much with friends; I don\u2019t\nremember my mother\u2019s friends or my father\u2019s friends, but I remember the\nrelatives always. Cousins, aunts, uncles.\n5",
        "Q: Do you remember any grownups talking about politics during those years?",
        "A: No. I remember that in 1939, they were talking about a war that looks like it was\ngoing to be a war. I remember everybody being worried. I remember the look on\ntheir faces, they were very worried that there was going to be a war. Then of\ncourse all of a sudden we were covered with bombs. They started bombing\nWarsaw.",
        "Q: So you remember the outbreak of the war?",
        "A: I remember the outbreak of the war. I remember us running downstairs in a\nshelter in the basement of the building and hiding until the sirens blew and then\nyou could go upstairs again. And this happened quite a few times a day\nsometimes. It was very bad and we had very few close calls, but our building was\nnever hit. Not in 1939.",
        "Q: Do you remember the battle for Warsaw in September 1939?",
        "A: When you say a battle ---",
        "Q: A battle, the bombardment and the siege of Warsaw?",
        "A: I remember the wall being built and I remember people being squished into\nquarters. There were so many people in the streets at that time, they had to move\nfrom other areas to move to another area where we were all like closed in. It\u2019s\nlike 1f you have people scattered all over they took a certain section and they\nmade you move there. You had to find a room where to stay. People usually\nstayed with relatives. This did not last very long because the starvation came in\nvery soon after the water, gas and electricity was shut off, food was shut off. No\nnewspapers, no radios and starvation came in very fast. I remember every\nmorning I looked out my window I saw dead people downstairs. They used to\ncome around with wagons and pick them up.",
        "Q: Can we back track just a little bit. Do you remember when the Germans first\nmarched into the city of Warsaw? When you first saw Germans in the streets?",
        "A: I saw them, it seems like, after the bombing. They were like animals running on\nthe motorcycles. I would see trucks. They made such noises that it frightened me\ntremendously. And everybody used to hide and run away, escape. They would\nhit people as would drive by or run over people. And I remember them as my\ninstinct told me this very cruel people, they are. And it\u2019s best to hide and not\nshow your face. I understood that immediately. Even though I saw my parents\ntalking quietly to each other, I suppose they were thinking what to do, where to\nget the next bite of food, but I saw them worried and I realized what it was.\n6",
        "Q: This was the year you were supposed to start school?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You probably had made plans?",
        "A: I made plans. I remember my mother buying me a beautiful outfit. I think the\nsailor suit I was wearing in the picture. This must have been the picture. The\noutfit I was going to wear.",
        "Q: What school would you have gone to?",
        "A: There was a public school I would say about ten blocks away from us. We used\nto walk there. There was a park not too far from us. I remember my father used\nto take me for walks. We went to the movies, we used to go for ice cream, go\nwalking in the park and play and he passed by once pointing out to a building\nsaying, see, someday you'll go to this school right over here. So I remember it\nwas not far because we walked there.",
        "Q: So your father liked to take you for walks?",
        "A: Yes, my father would be the one to take me for walks and explain to me, and tell\nme stories and things, sort of educating me.",
        "Q: Would you know what kind of schooling your father had?",
        "A: Yes. My father finished Gymnasia and I remember all the children of his family,\nbrothers and sisters were all educated.",
        "Q: How many languages could he speak?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but I did not understand certain languages that he spoke, but as\nyou can see he wrote German on the photographs. I suppose he must have known\nmore than two or three languages that I probably did not understand. I only spoke\nPolish. That was the only language I knew and everything else sounded like\nclatter to me.",
        "Q: Which it was. Do you recall any other changes that occur after the Germans take\nover Warsaw? You couldn\u2019t go to school?",
        "A: Everything was cut off.",
        "Q: What about your father\u2019s business?",
        "A: The business had ceased. Stopped right away. There was no need for it. It\nseemed like there was no money. There was nothing.\n7",
        "Q: So what did your mother and father do during these months?",
        "A: Trying to survive. We were very busy hiding in the shelters, getting food\ntogether, trying to sell off things and to buy maybe flour, maybe an apple.\nWhatever was available. Of course a lot of Poles were coming in to work in the\nghetto. There were factories, there were businesses and they would still be\ncoming in. They would smuggle in things, a lot of Jews would buy things off\nthem and give away a lot of precious things. They would give away art, they\nwould give away jewelry. They would give away whatever was precious for the\nslightest piece of food.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the ghetto was first set up?",
        "A: Yes. I lived in the building and on the corner of that particular building the wall\nhad started, so I was watching the bricks going up. Men were working over there,\nwhich I didn\u2019t understand at first why they\u2019re closing off. In other words our\nbuilding was on the inside of the ghetto which was the last building by the wall. I\nremember that and I remember them putting, the wall was so high, 1t seemed so\nhigh to me, they were putting broken glass, I remember the smashing of bottles\nand glass putting on the top of the wall.",
        "Q: Do you remember how long it took for them to build the wall?",
        "A: It did not take long at all. It seemed it grew by a foot or two or whatever.",
        "Q: Do you remember who was doing the construction work?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know who. I saw men working. I don\u2019t know if they were Poles or Jews.\nI don\u2019t know, but I saw men working and the Germans watching.",
        "Q: Not soldiers?",
        "A: They were German soldiers watching, standing with guns and civilians were\nworking, and I don\u2019t know who they were.",
        "Q: Do you remember when this wall was built?",
        "A: The date? I cannot give you a date.",
        "Q: The time of the year?",
        "A: I guess it was all the same time, the very beginning, during the bombing and\nthat\u2019s when the wall started. They must have decided right then and there. The\nbombs will stop, you know, start building the wall.\n8",
        "Q: So you continued to live in your old apartment?",
        "A: Yes, we stayed in our apartment.",
        "Q: Did anyone move into your apartment?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you remember any other changes following the building of this wall? For\nexample, when you went out in public were there any changes in the way you\nwent out?",
        "A: Well, you did not go out in public. You were afraid to go out. You never knew\nwhen the Germans would come through the gate and attack and capture people.\nAnd a lot of people were captured. I remember seeing children dying and\nbegging for food. I also remember my father taking me to a woman who myself\nand four other little girls we used to be taught how to read and write. So he used\nto take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take\nanother little girl, I don\u2019t know who she was, maybe she was a neighbor, and take\nus to this woman who used to teach us how to read and write for about, this went\non for six months. I would say I was being taught to read and write for the first six\nmonths maybe. And even that stopped because I was beaten up once in the street.\nI was wearing a little jacket and somebody wanted my jacket so they ripped my\njacket off and they hit me and I came home bleeding and this was the end of my\neducation, I guess.",
        "Q: Or the beginning of a new education?",
        "A: Yes. You don\u2019t go out anymore. Because at that time even there were hours,\nthere were times you knew when you were safe to go out in the street. And she\nwas only like maybe about a block away, I remember it was only about a five\nminute walk. So that\u2019s the reason why my father would take me or pick me up or\nI would walk back. And that was the end of that.",
        "Q: This was inside the ghetto after the wall had been built?",
        "A: Yes, inside the ghetto.",
        "Q: Do you know who attacked you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the face. I know I remember somebody hitting me and ripping\noff my jacket and I had something in my hand, maybe it was a little briefcase or\nsomething was grabbed. Maybe somebody who was starving, maybe he thought I\nhad food. Maybe his child was cold and he needed a jacket or something so he\ntook it off me.\n9",
        "Q: So he got it?",
        "A: So he got it, yes.",
        "Q: He was Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, it was in the ghetto. You saw a lot of these things happening. You were\nafraid to carry something. If you had something to carry, you usually carried it\ninside your coat so nobody would detect it, or else you were attacked by other\npeople if they suspect you have food on you, they\u2019d do anything. I guess when\nyour stomach is growling and you\u2019re starving you know no honor, you know no\nshame, you know nothing, you just know one thing, you have to eat.",
        "Q: The few times that you did go out with your father, for that matter, did you wear\nany kind of armband or star or anything?",
        "A: No. I did not have to wear anything. After that incident I was never allowed\nanymore to go outside anymore.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether your parents wore Jewish armbands?",
        "A: Yes, when my father went out he put on the armband and the minute he entered\nthe building, he would take it off. Just in case somebody spots him, he had to\nwear it.",
        "Q: How about your mother?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember my mother. I guess she must have worn it also. I don\u2019t\nremember her putting it on or taking it off. Maybe she did it outside when she left\nthe apartment. It was something you did not wear with pride, so like you didn\u2019t\nwant even your own children to see this so no questions would be asked. But I\nsaw people wearing them. I didn\u2019t ask because I think I knew what the answer\nwas going to be so I didn\u2019t ask too many questions. I was very silent.",
        "Q: I saw a photograph of your mother during these years. She looked like a very\nglamorous as well as a very lovely woman.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Did she go out a lot in the ghetto?",
        "A: Well the only time it was when they closed the ghetto and as I said the factory\nstill continued and she got a job there. A very prestigious job. But this took a\nwhile until she went out on the Polish side and she was in contact with the other\nPoles about papers. She got alien papers that she was not Polish, she was\n10\nUkrainian. Those were the papers she was given and her name was Ana\nGregorief (?). I will never forget that because she spoke Russian. She did not\ncome from Warsaw so her Polish had a very bad accent. And, therefore, to make\nsure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian. Then it\u2019s\nOK to have an accent. So she became Ana Gregorief and paid a fortune for these\npapers and as Ana Gregorief she got the job in the ghetto so she could go in and\ngo out and she would bring in food.",
        "Q: So she worked in the ghetto, but she was living outside of the ghetto.",
        "A: She had to go in and she had to go out. She could go in and go out, she had a\nspecial passport. The factory was like going around the clock. This was not a\nnine to five job. They were in a rush to make these uniforms or whatever they\nwere doing over there.",
        "Q: So she was making uniforms?",
        "A: Yes, the factory where they were making uniforms, maybe they were making\nother things. She never discussed what they were doing there.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember the name of the factory?",
        "A: No, but I remember her once, she came in, but this was a long time, much later,\n1943 already when she brought in a suitcase into the apartment and there were\nuniforms on the top and when she picked up the uniforms I remember seeing\nguns. Long shotguns and boxes I guess must have been bullets. She was bringing\nit into the ghetto from the Polish side because they were talking about an uprising.",
        "Q: So your mother smuggled guns into the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, she smuggled in several times, and of course she carried the suitcase as if it\nweighed only twenty pounds and it could have weighed over a hundred pounds.\nThat\u2019s how she got all dressed up so people would never dare, or the Germans\nnever dared to question her. She would just show them the flashed Ana\nGregorian, her name, her special pass that she could go in and go out and that\u2019s\nhow she got away.",
        "Q: Does the name Tobins mean anything to you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any names.",
        "Q: I know there was a factory making uniforms it was known as the Tobins Factory.",
        "A: I never saw the factory. The only time I ever saw was the time she brought the\nsuitcase when she brought once. I said what are these uniforms and she said these\nbelong to the factory. That\u2019s all I remember her saying. I don\u2019t know if this was\n11\nthe factory or another factory. I don\u2019t even know where she worked. There was\nno conversation, there was nothing was talked about so my sister and I could hear.\nMy father and mother when they talked nobody else could hear a word they were\nsaying. She didn\u2019t want us to know anything.",
        "Q: She slept though in the apartment?",
        "A: Yes. She would go in, she would go out she would like to go back and forth. She\nhad the permission to go back and forth.",
        "Q: She would also bring food?",
        "A: She also brought food. So we had food and nobody bothered her. Because\nnobody after awhile knew who she was. As people were dying out and, of course\nthe crowds in the very beginning were all gone already and there were very few\npeople now in the streets and those that survived already at that point were hidden\nin their apartments or in basements trying to scrounge food, together mainly. The\nghetto was getting smaller at that point, we had moved several times already.",
        "Q: So you were forced to move out of the apartment?",
        "A: Oh, yes, we were forced out of the apartment and they said we have to move. My\nmother at that time would say, we\u2019re going to move to a much nicer place. She\nstill tried to protect us that we should not know what\u2019s going on. We were like in\nthe blind in a way because she never wanted to reveal to us what was going on at\nthat time. But I remember moving and then again moving and then again moving.\nWe were constantly on the go.",
        "Q: Were these nicer places?",
        "A: No, they were not. They were just temporary quarters. We would walk into a\nbuilding and we would be the only ones in an entire building. We could take any\napartment, so we would run to a building that was not bombed and there were\nempty apartments. Every floor we looked in all over, we looked for food. There\nwas nothing there and we just slept anywhere.",
        "Q: What kind of food would your mother bring you?",
        "A: She would bring maybe a potato, she would bring flour, some kind of a vegetable,\na lot of fruit, a piece of bread, a piece of salami once she brought in. It was\nscrounged together, I guess, like leftovers they looked like more. It was not like\nyou went to a store and you bought it. She would ask the workers maybe they had\nleftovers from lunch, whatever it was, those were the leftovers she would buy it\nfrom them.",
        "Q: Before the time of the ghetto, were you considered a picky eater?\n12",
        "A: I was a picky eater, yes I was a very picky eater.",
        "Q: These are not the things she would have ordinarily given you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How about your father, did he get any jobs during this period? Was he working at\nany factories?",
        "A: No. He was watching my sister and me while my mother was the one looking\nvery Polish. Because as you can see on the photograph she did not resemble a\nJew. That\u2019s the reason why she got away. So she would get dressed up, she\nbought herself a coat, a hat to make sure she looked as elegant as possible.\nBecause if you look ragged you know, you would have been stopped right away.\nLike this if you walked with your head up high and very positive nobody bothered\nyou. I guess your attitude was very important. That\u2019s why she survived.",
        "Q: Your father stayed home and watched the kids?",
        "A: Well, he was watching us and he also kept an eye on his mother, his relatives, we\nwere still in contact in the beginning, we\u2019re still in contact with them.",
        "Q: They also lived in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the original ghetto. When the ghetto got smaller, my grandmother must have\ndied because I never heard about her again or maybe she was shot, I don\u2019t know,\nand neither were her uncles. Like nobody had remained. It was just my father,\nmy mother and the two of us. We were kept on the move. And then after awhile\nwe found out that one of his brothers was nearby when my mother said would try\nto find her. She\u2019ll go into the building and would try to find her. We found her,\nwe found only my father\u2019s sister-in-law, my aunt. She had given birth to a baby\nat that ttme. She was there with an infant. The infant was crying and we heard\nlike an echo, the ghetto was so empty. We heard the echo and we heard German\nvoices. We heard shotguns and we saw my aunt was thrown out of the window.\nShe was on the sidewalk and the baby was ripped in half was also on the\nsidewalk.",
        "Q: So you saw your aunt?",
        "A: I did not see, my father saw and my mother saw. We were hidden, at that time we\nwere hidden in a basement so I did not see anything what was going on the\noutside.",
        "Q: So your aunt was thrown out of the window?\n13",
        "A: Yes. This I remember my father and my mother, my father crying terribly.",
        "Q: Your cousin was torn?\nA; Yes, torn, it was a newborn infant.",
        "Q: So all you heard was the echo and the crying?",
        "A: Crying and then a silence. And if somebody marched blocks away you could hear\nthe footsteps. Especially German footsteps. You could hear German cars, trucks\nor motorcycles. It was a dead silence. Nobody even breathed so you are not\ndiscovered. At that time you are already hidden in ghetto and the building that we\nwere there were quite a few people with us. I would say about twenty people\nwere together and this is when the conversation started with the uprising. And\nthen other people came and we were all like together in this one particular area\nand they started talking. You know, there were very few of us left, that something\nshould be done and this is where my mother started bringing in the guns.\nWhatever should be done and this is when my mother began bringing in the guns.\nWhatever we need to do, she said, first we need to shoot our way out.",
        "Q: Were you afraid?",
        "A: Yes. I was very afraid. I didn\u2019t know what the next hour was going to bring. If\nwe will be discovered. My biggest fear was if someone will put a gun against my\nhead and shoot, because I\u2019ve seen so may to others and it looks so terrifying, this\nwas my biggest fear. It was bigger than starvation even.",
        "Q: So you saw people who were shot.",
        "A: Oh yes. I saw people shot, oh yes.",
        "Q: People you knew?",
        "A: People I knew? Even if people I knew I probably would not have recognized\nthem. People looked very different during the war. They became extremely\nskinny, they ages, they were very ragged looking, very dirty. There was no water.\nIf there would be no rain, we would never have nothing to drink. So even if\nsomebody was shot, I did not know who they were. I didn\u2019t know anybody. I\ndidn\u2019t recognize anyone. I just saw their brains being shot out.",
        "Q: Right on the street?",
        "A: On the street. Running. If you were running they would grab somebody and\nshoot them right in the head. If it was a child, or a woman, it made no difference,\nand leave them. And then there would be somebody to come with a little wagon\npicking up bodies. The bodies piling up and taking them someplace.\n14",
        "Q: How long did this go on?",
        "A: This went on until the plans were made for the Jewish uprising. Which was, I\nwould say, 1943. Since 1939. At that point when my mother knew there was\ngoing to be an uprising, she made arrangements for my sister and myself to be\ntaken out of the ghetto and taken by the Poles, one family was called Doblinkov\n(?) and whom I was held in their home. I was taken out, smuggled out of there.",
        "Q: By your mother?",
        "A: No, not by my mother, the Poles with a truckload of merchandise went out and we\nwere hidden on the truck and then we were supposed to be dropped off at a certain\npoint, we jumped off the truck and they were waiting for us. Two people were\nwaiting for us, one took my sister, one took me. I didn\u2019t know the whereabouts of\nmy sister and this was the last time I saw my parents. And we stayed with the\nDoblinkov (?) family which was about, quite a ride with the trolley. At that time,\non the Polish side, the trolleys were going. So we were changing trolleys and\ngoing like to the outskirts of Warsaw and I saw a very little, private little cottage,\na little house. This is where I was brought in by this man. He had a daughter\nabout a year or two older than myself and a son about a year or two younger than\nme. And he introduced me to the family that I am going to live with them and I\nand their mother\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter who died so they are to take care of me and I\ncome from another town. I don\u2019t remember. Lodz or Krakow, or whatever.\nThey picked a city and said this is where I come from and this is going to be my\nname and this is where I\u2019m going to stay. My name was Yasha.",
        "Q: Yasha?",
        "A: Yes, I became Yasha Doblinkov. And they said this is where I am to stay and this\nis going to be my family. And I had to adjust to that instantly. The first thing, I\nwas very happy, they gave me food. They gave me, I remember, a giant bowl of\npotatoes, mashed potatoes and I think I finished it. It was I think maybe five\npounds and I finished it all. And they gave me a glass of milk, which is\nsomething I had not seen in years, since before the war. That was good. So I\nthink they got through to me through my stomach.",
        "Q: You had never seen these people?",
        "A: I have never seen them, I have never known them.",
        "Q: Would you say you were quite skinny when you arrived there?",
        "A: Yes. I was very skinny and she said to me, I am going to fatten you up. Don\u2019t\nworry you\u2019re going to look very nice.\n15",
        "Q: Did she say anything else to you?",
        "A: Yes. Of course when the uprising started, which did not last very long. After that\nall of ghetto was burning. It was aflame. One giant flame and she took me\noutdoors and she said to me, you know, this is where you come from and this is\nwhere your parents are. And I remember remarking the sky was so red, like\nblood, it looked like and it was towards evening. And she said to me, you will\nnever see your parents again. They perished in the fire. So you are going to stay\nwith us. I am going to take you to church. You\u2019re going to go through a\nCommunion. You'll become a Christian and you\u2019ll become part of my family and\nwe will treat you equally with my children. I started to cry. I wanted to see my\nmommy and I wanted to see my daddy and I didn\u2019t want to live with them. I\ndidn\u2019t want to go to a church. But she said, if you are not going to obey we will\nhave to take you back where you came from. So I just closed my mouth. I shut up\nand I didn\u2019t say another word. I just did whatever they told me to do.",
        "Q: And you ate the food?",
        "A: And | ate the food, yes, and they gave me a little bed in the corner to sleep.",
        "Q: Is this around the time you started to wear the cross?",
        "A: They put a cross on me, yes. They put the cross on me a very short time after\nthat. They said to me you are going to church so you must wear a cross and I did\nnot take that cross off until six months after the war. This was I felt like my, in a\nway I wasn\u2019t hungry anymore since I wore the cross. So I felt that this maybe\nprotected me from starvation. And they said if you wear the cross you will never\nbe hungry and you will always have a roof over your head and we are going to be\nyour family because you have nobody else",
        "Q: How long did you live with them?",
        "A: Oh, for a few months, I would say, quite a few months. At that point already, I\nrealized that my mother and my father are gone. I didn\u2019t realize, of course, that\nmy father was captured. Right during the uprising he was captured taking\n, my mother, of course, head out. She was still in the ghetto for\nquite some time and the way she got out is a whole story by itself. It was very\nmiraculous. At that time she did not look so elegant, she did not look so\nglamorous as she did just a couple of months before that. She was hungry, she\nwas tired, she lost a husband in that time and she changed tremendously and the\nfew people that did survive were in the sewers for quite some time and then when\nthey got on the other side, that\u2019s the reason why it took such a time, until she\nfinally one evening just knocked on the door and came to the Doblinkov family\nand when I saw her, to me it was like a new world had opened up. I never\nbelieved I\u2019d ever see her again.\n16",
        "Q: You never believed the Doblinkov\u2019s ;",
        "A: They were going to be my parents, I had to mentally adjust myself that this is it. I\nam most probably stay with them. I never thought that my mother was going to\nmarch in through the door.",
        "Q: She did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you recognize her?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Immediately I ran to her arms and I wouldn\u2019t let go. I held onto her\ndress. She took me by the hand, she took a few things and said that some of the\npeople gave them something when we walked out. We had a car waiting outside.\nI don\u2019t know if it was some kind of taxi, or somebody doing my mother a favor or\nwhatever. Whoever it was, I don\u2019t know. All I know I was so happy looking and\nstaring at my mother\u2019s face, I couldn\u2019t believe that she was there and then we\ndrove for about fifteen minutes to another building where I had to sit in the car\nand she brought my sister down all wrapped up in a blanket and it seemed like\nthey were starving my sister because she looked terrible. She was all swollen\nwith no clothes on, frozen and it was very cold and my mother wrapped her up in\nthe blanket and came running down angrily what they had done to her child in\nthose few months only.",
        "Q: So you had not seen your sister since March of \u201943?",
        "A: I saw her only one time when that family has written a letter to the Doblinkov\nfamily that they have the other sister and they probably want to know, maybe they\ncan get rid of her and send her to me. So there was an address and I said to my\n, Lused to call her my aunt, I said to my Aunt Doblinkov, I said can I\nplease see my sister? I had five minutes. So, I remember going on a trolley and\nher daughter went with me and we went upstairs and I only had five minutes and I\nremember my sister laying over there in bed and Mrs. Doblinkov gave a piece of\nsalami and a piece of bread to give it to my sister. So when I came in I gave this\nto her and she was very cold and the woman was standing there and watching. I\ngave her the food and she hid it under the blanket and I stood there helpless not\nknowing what to do. I saw that she was dying, that she was starving and there\nwas nothing I could do about it. And the woman said, OK., your time is up you\ngot to leave. I said I just want to sit with my sister a little more. No, she said, you\nhave to go. Lady, I said, I want to be with her. She said no, leave and I had to\nleave. I left her the food and when I came back to Mrs. Doblinkov she asked\nabout my sister. I said she is very, very hungry. I\u2019ve known children that look\nlike her they usually die right after that. She said there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\nI cannot help her.\n17",
        "Q: So your mother snatched her?",
        "A: Snatched her out in the nick of time, and she was dying. As a matter of fact, she\ndid not grow for five years, not one inch, after that incident. After those few\nmonths of the starvation I guess this is what happens to children. The lack of\neverything. My mother was very frightened that she\u2019ll be a midget, she was so\ntiny. Not until we came to the United States she started growing.",
        "Q: Where did your mother take you?\nSIDE 2.",
        "A: A very nice apartment.",
        "Q: In Warsaw?",
        "A: In Warsaw on the Dobra Street, which was right across from the Vislag (?) River.",
        "Q: This was outside of the ;",
        "A: As Poles, yes. We lived as Poles. We all had our papers. I had my ;",
        "Q: My mother found an apartment on the Dobra Street, this is where we lived and\nshe got a job. She was working in a factory again. I guess run by the Germans,\nso she had enough money to pay for the rent and it was also food was scarce in\nPoland, but you were not starving and we came to ourselves after awhile. In the\nmeantime my mother did a lot of heroic things while she worked in the factories\nand manufactured the uniforms, she decided to custom make some uniforms for\nsome big generals, big \u201cmachers,\u201d they called them in Jewish. And they sent her\nto several different concentration camps. She wound up going.",
        "Q: Not as a prisoner?",
        "A: Not as a prisoner, but asking them what sizes they are, what kind of uniforms they\nwant. So she could make them up custom made for the upper echelon type of\ngenerals. This was one time when she saw my father very briefly, from a\ndistance.",
        "Q: She saw your father?",
        "A: She saw my father from a distance, and she whispered to him, of course nobody\ncould see, you got a chance, you can put on one of those uniforms and you can\nescape. He says I cannot run even, how can I escape? You go, save yourself and\nsave the children, forget about me. And this was the last she saw him. But there\nwas another man that did run away with her. Went along with her on the truck.\nThis is the man that has written a book and he has written about this whole\n18\nepisode in the book. His name is Cheslov (?). I don\u2019t know if this man is alive or\nnot, and I have the book that he has written. There is a whole chapter about my\nmother. And after she took him out she brought him on Dobra Street. She\nbrought him into the apartment and we held him there for awhile. Then the\nfollowing week, she went to another camp and she brought in two sisters she took\nout, two women that she said she needed them as assistants. They let them out,\nshe brought them and she brought them to the apartment also. And one night the\nGermans were knocking at the door. The two sisters were caught and they were\ntaken out. This man went out the window and he was not captured.",
        "Q: The man that she smuggled from the camp?",
        "A: Yes, he was not captured. And they left with the two sisters, they left.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t punish your mother for this?",
        "A: No. They, I don\u2019t remember what was the story, she just must have told them that\nmaybe they knocked on the door and she let them in. They just came in, they just\nwalked in, or something, some kind of an excuse. She made believe she doesn\u2019t\nknow them. It\u2019s not like this was an old friendship or something. That she did it\nintentionally. Seems like these two women just walked in and they asked to sleep\nover maybe, or they asked for something, so they let us alone.",
        "Q: Do you know when your mother saw your father for the last time?",
        "A: The last time I would say a year before the war ended, maybe less. Maybe it was\nless than when the war ended. She said he looked terrible.",
        "Q: You had been living in the Polish part of Warsaw for a year?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Which camp was this?",
        "A: My father? In Miedniewice.",
        "Q: Would you know which other camps your mother visited as a custom seamstress?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I know she went to several camps. She never discussed anything\nwith me or my sister. She never told us very much. She would say I have to go\naway and I\u2019ll be back in a few days. That\u2019s all we knew. We never questioned\nher. She would say you are not to leave the house and you are not to leave the\napartment. Keep it locked at all times, and that\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: Nobody was there to take care of you?\n19",
        "A: No, no. We were there ourselves.",
        "Q: Did she tell you that she saw your father?",
        "A: She told us that a long time afterwards.",
        "Q: Until that time you did not know?",
        "A: No. We knew, I sensed that something was wrong when she came back. She did\nnot sleep, she talked to herself, she was shouting, she was crying and I knew\nsomething was wrong, but she didn\u2019t want to tell us what it was. It was only\nyears after when she told us. I saw him from a distance, I would have never\nrecognized him in a million years if he stood a foot in front of me, but he\nrecognized me. So he called out my name and I saw him.",
        "Q: So he recognized her first?",
        "A: He recognized my mother first. She did not know where the voice was coming\nfrom. She would not have known it was him. All she told him I can save you. If\nPll throw you the uniform, put it on and walk out, march out like a German. And\nhe was like behind a fence and she was on this side of the fence. There were a lot\nof fences. There were men standing there with those striped uniforms and she\ntried to save him, which I think would have been hopeless anyway, so he was\nafraid that he\u2019s going to jeopardize her life, so he says no, no. He did not want to\ngo. In a way she could not forgive herself seeing him and yet maybe she could\nhave helped him as a Ukrainian but he didn\u2019t want to jeopardize her life. He\ndidn\u2019t want to go.",
        "Q: Was he a slave laborer?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know he was just standing there with other men. She doesn\u2019t know, he\nmust have been working, they must have been feeding him a little bit, because he\nsurvived. He did survive sometime there. I would say maybe like seven or eight\nmonths later when she saw him. This was the last person on earth she expected to\nsee. She knew that he was taken to this concentration camp. This she knew.\nBecause she realized that this particular truck they captured people, that\u2019s where\nthey were going.",
        "Q: So she knows when he was taken away during the uprising?",
        "A: Yes. It was just the beginning of the uprising.",
        "Q: The very beginning?",
        "A: The very beginning of the uprising.\n20",
        "Q: Did you ever find out later what your mother was doing during the uprising?",
        "A: What she did during the uprising? I guess she was fighting like the handful of\npeople that were there. They were fighting until there were very few people left.\nShe said it was a glorious fight. It was glorious. So they gave her a reason to live\nagain. There was a thread of hope, of course. They knew they cannot do very\nmuch but just to give the Germans something back. A little revenge for all the\naches and pains they caused everybody.",
        "Q: Did she ever describe how she got out? how this Ukrainian factory woman who\nbecame a Jewish fighter how then she survived and got out of the ghetto and then\nfound you?",
        "A: Oh, this was through the sewers, this took time, this took time, until she finally\ngot out of there. They could not escape, they put the gas in the sewers, they made\nsure that nobody can escape, there were dogs all over. They had to be at a hideout\nfor quite some time until they could get out from wherever they were hiding until\nit became clearer that she could get out of there. But this took awhile, because\nthey were on the lookout. They knew that whoever survived this uprising would\nwant to escape because there was nothing else left there. It was a handful of\nheroic people and they\u2019re not ready to give up. So even the sewers you couldn\u2019t\ngo, it was all gas there. They would have gotten poisoned. So they had to wait\nprobably until it was o.k. to find a way to leave.",
        "Q: Did your mother survive and escape by herself or was she with others?",
        "A: No, I think they could not go in groups. Everybody went their own way, because\nin a group it is more dangerous. Singularly it always easier to escape when a\nsingle person runs. I don\u2019t know, maybe they started as a group and they wound\nup individually, I don\u2019t know. She never talked about that particular incident. It\nwas a very painful incident in her life. Very painful. And even though she used to\ntalk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small ghetto,\nat one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I\nwere gone and my father was gone. It seems like the Germans came, they were\ncoming and they said we\u2019re going to put the building on fire whoever\u2019s there\ndoesn\u2019t run away or doesn\u2019t give themselves up they\u2019re going to get burned alive.\nSo I don\u2019t know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my\nfather, where was my father, I\u2019m trying to think, he was also gone in the morning.\nHe did not go to work, but my mother went to work and he went someplace and\nmy sister and I were left alone. And when the Germans came, we looked at each\nother, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace. So, we went\ndownstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall\nthere to go to the next building and the next building, so we escaped through a\nfew other buildings. They were also empty, so we didn\u2019t know what had\nhappened to the building we were originally. I don\u2019t know if they put it on fire or\nthey didn\u2019t put it. But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another\n21\nbuilding and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to\napartment which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere. We turned\nquietly every drawer and every closet, we looked all over and then we hear\nGermans marching downstairs and they\u2019re entering the building and here\u2019s my\nsister and I alone in this apartment and it\u2019s all empty. I remember I took her and I\nput her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet. I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet\nand I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest\nthat stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest. I squished in the\nback of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in\nthey\u2019 ll think there are rags there. And I took a blanket and covered myself and\nthe two of us stayed there. We heard the German footsteps and we heard them\ngetting closer and closer and then they kicked open the door and they marched in\nthis apartment. They must have been looking for Jews from apartment to\napartment. This was their preoccupation and that\u2019s how I know this, and they\nwalked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns. They were shooting\nin every apartment. All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting. I\nguess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them\nor something. So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I\nheard them talking loud and clear I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying.\nThen I heard them walk out. And when they walked out and they left the door,\nmy first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister\u2019s name, are you alive? She says Yes,\nare you alive? I said yes. So we got together again, she came out of the cabinet\nand we decided we\u2019re going to hide in the attic. From now on it was no good in\nthe apartment because they are shooting and they may shoot us. So we\u2019ll go in\nthe attic. We go all the way up in the attic and there\u2019s a lot of furniture and we\nhear voices. So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were\npeople hidden in the attic. We started moving the furniture away and the people\noutside didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let\nus in, let us in, we got to hide with you. So my sister said, well, I\u2019m going to cry\nso loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I\u2019m going to tell them that\nyou\u2019re hiding there, so let us in there. We came in over there, we sat with them,\nthey had water, so we drank a little water with them.",
        "Q: Did you know who these people were?",
        "A: I had no idea. We just walked in. There were about three or four people there. It\nlooked like older people, maybe at that time, maybe they were in their 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s,\n60\u2019s. I don\u2019t know I couldn\u2019t even judge the age. We stayed with them for a few\ndays and then we left them, and we were going from building to building, we got\nto find our parents, where are our parents, we had no idea. And from one of the\nbuildings we saw there were schlep carts and we saw people gathering and the\ntwo of us would look out the window, you know hidden behind the curtain, to\nmake sure we don\u2019t see our mother or our father. I didn\u2019t know what to look for.\nI didn\u2019t see them. So, I said, you see they did not get caught, they didn\u2019t get\ncaught they must be someplace. Don\u2019t you think my mother came around. She\n22\nwalked also from building to building yelling quietly, Frania, Chaja, just like an\necho from the distance it sounded like. So she found us.",
        "Q: She found you?",
        "A: And my father must have gone to work also that day. My mother went to work,\nmy father went also to do something. Maybe to look for food.",
        "Q: So your father worked sometimes?",
        "A: Like sometimes, depending. They were always very busy, they were always\ndoing something.",
        "Q: What would your father do whenever he found some work?",
        "A: I guess whatever labor they gave you. They didn\u2019t ask you what your talents\nwere. They needed somebody. I guess like today, you know, people want a job,\nwhatever they\u2019ll tell them to do they\u2019ll do, so there was no question of asking\nwhat your talents are or what you specialize, I\u2019ll do anything.",
        "Q: This episode that you just described, this flashback, this was before the ghetto\nuprising, long before?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Not long before. This was in a small ghetto. This was when we had an\napartment , when we were staying there for awhile.",
        "Q: This wasn\u2019t the Morenovska (\u2019?)",
        "A: No, the Morenovska, we were gone already. This was like the third or the fourth\napartment already, that we were on the go. So we were like constantly like\ngypsies on the go running. The minute we were afraid maybe they heard\nfootsteps, we would leave the building already. We were afraid to stay in the\nsame place three or four nights that\u2019s it and you had to be on the move.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the way it was until they took you to the Doblenkov house?",
        "A: Yes. This was up until, I would say, the last few weeks before we went to the\nDoblenkov\u2019s. Then we were like more settled with other people. All of a sudden\nI saw a lot of other people. I don\u2019t remember their faces, but I remember there\nwere quite a few people there and they were talking constantly and making plans\nand they would tell us, there were a few children, go sit on the side, go away, not\nto bother anybody, and they were making their plans. So we were there for a\nwhile. Once they made up, I guess, a date when they\u2019re going to start this. This\nis when my mother made up her mind to get me and my sister, to get us on the\nPolish side so we\u2019re not going to get caught.\n23",
        "Q: Now, back to Warsaw after the uprising, when you were living in the -----",
        "A: On Dobra Street?",
        "Q: Yes. Were you living in Warsaw when the Polish uprising occurred?",
        "A: Yes. It did not take very long, I heard shooting in the streets and my mother came\nrunning in like she was being chased for G-d knows how many blocks or miles\nand when she came in she says would you believe that the Russians were\nsupposed to come and they\u2019re not coming, they\u2019re on the other side, on the Prague\nside, and they\u2019re not crossing the river and they told the Poles to start. This was\nthe first time she talked to me, and she says and the Poles are starting an uprising\nnow. So we\u2019re going to get caught now in the middle of their uprising.",
        "Q: How long had you been there when the uprising begins?",
        "A: Immediately. We had to leave right away. They made announcements.\nEverybody to leave the buildings. Everybody to go. They\u2019re going to shoot every\nPole that\u2019s going to stay here and help the Russians to cross.",
        "Q: So how long had it been since you left the Doblenkov\u2019s and then lived in Warsaw\nbefore the uprising?",
        "A: On the Dobro Street? A few months.\nQ; Just a few months?",
        "A: Just ac few months, yes. Then we had the uprising again and we were on the go\nagain. And I remember my mother burying a suitcase. She says one thing I don\u2019t\nwant to carry with me is luggage. Let\u2019s bury it in the basement, we\u2019ll come back\nif we ever survive the war we\u2019re going to take out my little treasures, pictures,\nletters, addresses of relatives in Israel, relatives in the United States.",
        "Q: She was not involved in this particular uprising?",
        "A: No, no. She couldn\u2019t care less about it. It was a nuisance. It was a tremendous\nnuisance. They started burning buildings and chasing the Poles and running\nthrough the streets and the buildings were all burning and they were chasing.\nAlso I remember running for about twenty blocks and the last few blocks the\nbuildings were ablaze and we couldn\u2019t crossing. We couldn\u2019t go through\nanymore. There was a church and they made us all, quite a few hundred, pushed\ninto this church.",
        "Q: The Germans pushed?",
        "A: Yes, all the Poles pushed into this church. My mother made sure ----\n24",
        "Q: And you were still passing as a Pole?",
        "A: Oh yes. We had Polish papers and nobody knew otherwise. We were right at the\ndoor. At the door or there was a window, some kind of exit even if we were\nlocked in we would be able to get out, because my mother said I have a feeling\nthey\u2019re going to do something to us. They\u2019re going to, she thought they\u2019re going\nto put the poison gas and they\u2019re going to poison everybody there. We didn\u2019t\nknow they were going to put it on fire. So we just broke through the glass and\npeople started panicking. They were breaking all the like stained glass, whatever\nthere was there. People started climbing from the windows and running and\njumping into the flames and we ran. At that point we ran with the fire on both\nsides. My mother grabbed me and my sister. I don\u2019t remember how far, I was\nlike in a daze, we just ran until finally it was a clearance and all the people that\ncame out into a clearance, the Germans were there and there was a train and we\nall were pointed to get on the train and my mother saw a train and she was like\npetrified. She says oh, my G-d, we\u2019re going to a concentration camp. She\nalready knew at that point that all trains were going only in one direction. But it\ndid not go to a concentration camp, it went to another camp, some kind of camp, a\ndetention camp where as Poles we were held over there, but there were not like\nguards, they gave us to eat, they gave us cots to sleep on and we had like a army\nblanket even to cover ourselves and I remember that my mother said, this is no\ngood, I don\u2019t like this business here, you know, with the Poles they\u2019re going to do\nsomething with them also. It\u2019s mostly women and children here. The men, they\nwere shooting them like dogs. And we escaped. We were not there very long, we\nescaped.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of this camp?",
        "A: No. [I have no idea.",
        "Q: So where did you go?",
        "A: We started running. Most of the time we were hiding out during the day and we\nwere on foot at night. And we went through towns and villages all on foot and we\nstopped at different, and I remember my mother saying, if we\u2019re going to walk in\nthis direction another twenty kilometers there\u2019s a small town I know some people\nthere. We\u2019ll go there and when we made it over there, we stayed with them, I\nthink for about two nights, and we heard the Germans outside so we ran out to the\nback, the three of us escaped. And we were on the run continuously on the run\nuntil I don\u2019t know for how long on foot until we came to this primitive little\nvillage where only farms, like small little straw roof type of little huts. People\nlived like that and we were all very ragged, and my mother marched into these\nhouses, claiming some kind of accident, something happened and we needed\nrefuge for just a few days. And when they asked us where we come from. We\nsaid we come from Warsaw. She said, oh, she heard about Warsaw, can you tell\n25\nus stories about it. She says if you let me sleep here, I'll tell you all the stories\nyou want to know. They heard about wagons going on electric. This was all\nprimitive, and when I think back, my G-d like a few hundred years behind times.",
        "Q: These were peasants?",
        "A: Real peasants. Good natured, nice people, that were afraid of their own shadows.\nThey knew there was a war, because the Germans came and took away most of\ntheir cattle, and took away whatever they had. They were constantly coming and\ntook away their wheat and their corn, whatever they were growing.",
        "Q: Do you remember the time of the year that you were with these people?",
        "A: We were there in the winter. We were there until the Russians came into this\nvillage. That\u2019s how long we were there.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day the Russians came to the village?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I remember the day they marched in I don\u2019t remember the date,\nbecause I think we were all in a state of shock.",
        "Q: Was it the middle of winter though?",
        "A: I remember it being cold. I don\u2019t know if it was the beginning, the end or the\nmiddle of winter, but I remember it being very cold. When the Russians came in\nmy mother started talking Russian to them. She could not get over that they came\nin, and the first question she had for them, did you hear of a Bernard Friedman,\nmy brother is in Russia, maybe he is in the army? Well after awhile we found a\nJewish Russian soldier who was a Jew. He was very nice. As the Russians came\nin and the war is over, and they said they are chasing the Germans are just in front\nof them and they were passing with tanks which were so loud and we packed up\nour few little belongings and they did not mind taking us, jumping in the truck\nand taking us along, a part of a truck and part we sat on a tank. Just to get out of\nthis village, and we wanted to go to any town and as we were going through on\nthese vehicles we saw the Germans hanging from trees. Which was some sight to\nsee.",
        "Q: How were they hanging?",
        "A: They were hanging some by the legs, some by the neck, some by the hands.\nSome by one foot. They just hung them live. They were hanging live there. As\nthey turned around, they were practice shooting with them. They took guns, they\nwere shooting at them and they were jumping on their ropes, and they were\nyelling in Russian, this is for my mother and this is for my father, what you did to\nmy country to my Mother Russia. For the millions you\u2019ve killed. You know.\nAnd this is what they were yelling at. Even I understood the few words in\n26\nRussian. I didn\u2019t know Russian, but I understood those few words, it was very\nsimilar to Polish.",
        "Q: What was your reaction to this scene?",
        "A: I was glad. I was very glad. I hated the Germans so much with such passion that\nI think if they cut them alive, it would not have bothered me. On the contrary, I\nthink I would have found some kind of satisfaction.",
        "Q: How about your mother, how was she?",
        "A: My mother went into a shock. She actually went into a shock because after a\nshort while after she got very sick. And they told her that she was in a shock. I\ndon\u2019t think it was a stroke, it was some kind of a shock she went into. When we\ncame into one of the cities, we passed by a city, I don\u2019t even know what big city\nwe passed by, she went to a hospital. I was there sitting and they told her they\nhave to treat her for a few days. And I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her.\nBut I remember my sister and I sitting and waiting for her to get well, because we\ncouldn\u2019t go anyplace without her. This was it, you know. She got well after a\nfew days and I remember she became very calm. She was not as wild as she was\nduring the war. She would do crazy things. She would jump, and run, and lift\nand pick. But here after she got sick, we were released, I guess from the German\nagony, I guess you never thought the end was going to come. Every day was a\nyear, you\u2019re talking about five long miserable years, miserable years.",
        "Q: The period you were on the run, from when you escaped from the Polish\ndetention camp until the time the Russians caught you.",
        "A: That took also quite a few months.",
        "Q: When you first escaped, what time of the year was it? Was it summer?",
        "A: It was warm. I know it was warm because from the fire it was hot, or something,\nor the people in trains. But I was warm.",
        "Q: How did you manage to survive the change in seasons? You probably were\ndressed lightly in the summer and then months later it was winter?",
        "A: We were shivering. If we could steal something to wear or if we saw a body we\nwould rip off something to wear. I wore maybe a hundred different kinds of\nshoes. Whatever I could find, I had no shoes at all. Most of the time my mother\nwanted me to be very quiet when I walked so she made me walk without shoes.\nAnd I shouldn\u2019t knock. But we used to always find something on ways. We\nfound rags. Once we passed a small river, so my mother washed my face, she\nsaid my G-d, I forgot what you looked like. I was black from mud, from\ncrawling, from hiding,\n27",
        "Q: You were still at Doblinkov until the Russians came? Were you still called\nDoblinkov?",
        "A: No. Once my mother took me out from the Doblinkov family. I was not a\nDoblinkov anymore. I had those papers like this. The only thing was she claimed\nthat she adopted a daughter, I was a relative\u2019s daughter and she adopted me. So\nthat\u2019s the reason why she and I had two different names.",
        "Q: So officially you were still Doblinkov. And this went on until the Russians came\nin.",
        "A: No, once in the primitive village, we didn\u2019t need any papers or anything. Nobody\nquestioned us, nobody knew from anything anymore. It was like I said, they\ndidn\u2019t even know anything exists. You know, from a clock, they knew nothing.",
        "Q: Did they know Jews?",
        "A: They heard about people that were Jews and they heard, they\u2019re supposed to look\nout for them because they are very cruel and very mean and you can usually tell\njust by looking at them. That was a propaganda, of course. Oh, if you see a Jew\nyou'll know right away, he\u2019ll look subhuman, first of all.",
        "Q: Are they worse than Nazis, these Jews supposedly?",
        "A: Not in that way, no. They were just vicious and they were ugly and they tried to\nsteal from you whatever you had. They tried to connive you whatever you had.",
        "Q: More than the Germans did?",
        "A: Yes. It shows you this was in the schools. The children were taught like that. The\nchildren were taught, the Polish children were taught, they would make a picture\nof this, I don\u2019t know, a witch I guess they would pick, and they would say this is\nwhat a Jew looks like. And it is the biggest honor to find one, and if you want to\nkill them yourself, it\u2019s o.k., and if you want to give him to us, we\u2019ll kill him.",
        "Q: But they wouldn\u2019t know one even if they were under their own roof?",
        "A: No. They never saw one. They only know from what they heard. Don\u2019t forget,\nthe war was on for quite a few years already at that point and they knew nothing\nof what was going on in the outside their village.",
        "Q: So they had three of them right in their own house?\n28",
        "A: And they thought that we were very fancy people from Warsaw after we washed\nup. They realized that they called my mother. In Polish there\u2019s an expression,\n\u201cPania (?) Intelligencia\u201d that means you are a lady pf intelligence.",
        "Q: Of intellect.",
        "A: Of intellect and, therefore, if we have any questions they would ask her when\nChristmas comes out, when the holidays. Of course, they have no calendar, no\nclock, nothing, no radio. Didn\u2019t know anything. If I thought , and they\ngave us this tiny little room that was supposed to have been an attached bathroom\noriginally, just some boards. This is where we slept. So they knew nothing about\nJews if they hit them over the head, probably. Luckily, they were very nice to us,\nThey gave us food, we ate with them and my mother helped them with the farm,\nwith the work and I did some work. I would sweep and clean and grow things.\nWhatever she told me to do, we would do it.",
        "Q: When did you become Frania Prawer again?",
        "A: Again?",
        "Q: I mean openly.",
        "Q: Openly? In Germany. Because after the war, after we left Warsaw and we saw\nwe had nothing there, we registered.",
        "Q: You returned to Warsaw eventually?",
        "A: Right after the war we returned to Warsaw, my mother wanted to get that\nbriefcase.",
        "Q: And what did she find?",
        "A: Nothing. Rubbles. All rubbles you couldn\u2019t even tell if a building was once\nstanding. It was all burned down and we went to Berlin. We stayed in Berlin for\nabout six months and we were in Berlin we tried to get to the American side\nbecause we were told it was best from the Russian side with the Russians,\neventually, like with cars, trucks, trains until we got from Poland to Berlin we did\na lot of traveling. So we wound up on the Russian side of Berlin and then we\nescaped to the French side and then finally got to the American side. Once we\nwere on the American side, we re-registered and we found a lot of other Jews\nthere and they told us that there are some camps in Germany, they\u2019re called DP\ncamps where all the Jews after the war should gather, and from there we will see\nwhat to do further, where to go further. So this is where we wound up from\nBerlin we went to Eschfegan (?), Germany, a DP camp where we lived for almost\nfour years.\n29",
        "Q: From when to when were you in this camp?",
        "A: In that camp we got there in the beginning of \u201946, I would say, until \u00b049, when we\ncame to the United States.",
        "Q: So you came to the U.S. in \u201949, the three of you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And lived happily ever after.",
        "A: Well, much happier than during the war.",
        "Q: And your sister finally grew up?",
        "A: Yes, she did grow up. My mother took her to several doctors. She used to get\nsome vitamins and very special things but she did grow up.",
        "Q: Looking back, what was the worst part of this experience for you, the worst\nmoment? Was it the time when you and your sister were hiding?",
        "A: That was one of the moments. It felt like it was the end. We had no place to go.\nThis was the finality because we didn\u2019t think we were going to see our parents\nagain. Also, when I was separated from my sister with the Doblenkov family, this\nwas petrifying thought for me that I would be a Pole the rest of my life with a\nfamily I don\u2019t even know. I have to live with them and I had to live their style.\nWhatever I remember from before the war or even during the war the love, the\naffection I got from my parents, it\u2019s all gone. I don\u2019t know this was one of the\nmoments. There were so many moments.",
        "Q: When did you remove the cross that you wore?",
        "A: This was after the war when we were in Poland, when we were in Warsaw, just\nbefore we went to Berlin.\nThe first thing she found out that Jewish children, they want all the Jewish\nchildren in this summer camp, and it was a magnificent place. It seemed like\nthere was a palace over there and everybody lived over there. It was like they\ntook over something and we lived there. There were like a hundred children for a\nvery short time, and we were supposed to be, I suppose they must have advised\nmy mother to bring us there for a few months to retrain our thoughts to make us\naware that the war was over, which I refused to believe. Although I saw signs of\nthe war being over, but I still did not believe, I thought that the Germans would\nspring out from someplace, make a surprise. I didn\u2019t trust anybody anymore. I\ndid not believe anybody anymore. I didn\u2019t want to get close to anybody. They\ntried, they worked on me very, very hard, until I took the cross off, it took awhile\n30\nand I think what influenced me the most was when I met from Israel in the camp,\nthere were some young Israeli, all though there was no Israel at that time, it was\nPalestine, but they came in some kind of uniforms from the kibbutz, maybe, or\nwhatever. They were dressed with the berets and I was so impressed when I\nlooked at them and they said, you see they are just like you, they are also Jews.\nAnd these are young soldiers and this, I think, I fell in love with them the minute I\nsaw them. It was almost like all of a sudden I discovered something, a goal,\nsomething different to leave my past and this is the future to go to Israel and to be\njust like them. And I wanted very much to be just like them and this is where I\nrealized I\u2019m not Polish I\u2019m going to go to Israel and I\u2019m going to find a new\nenemy called Arabs.",
        "Q: If you had been old enough you probably would have married one of them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You were still a little girl. Never went to school.",
        "A: No. In those few months they prepared us that we\u2019ll have to start going to school.\nWhen I was in Germany we went to school six days a week and many\nhours a day. From morning until evening we were going to school, and they tried\nto put in those few years all the missing years of schooling that the majority of\nkids were. Everybody was missing five years of school, so you had children from\nall ages. There were also children that were born in concentration camps, there\nwere children that were orphaned, they were taken away from Polish people. I\nmet a lot of people in , also in that camp where we stayed right after the war\nwhen we came to Warsaw after the war when we stayed in this camp. I also met\nsome people from all over and the majority were staying with other families.\nThat\u2019s how they survived and it seems like the families, some kids escaped, some\nof them were older already. Some of them at that time were like 17 or 18 years\nold. They must have run away when the war was over and they came voluntarily\nto this place to find themselves to know who they are. Some, maybe the families,\nthe Polish families, brought them, I don\u2019t know. But they were like dumped.\nBefore you know it within a few weeks more than a hundred children there. So\nthey brought all these psychologists, people talking to us and retraining us, trying\nto make us forget the war in a way and to think that there is another life now is\ngoing to start. There\u2019s a future.",
        "Q: So when was it you realized the war was over and that a new life was about to\nbegin?",
        "A: When I was in that camp, that summer camp. I found it to be beautiful. Because\nI found people like myself. At first I thought I was the only survivor on this\nplanet. This is a horrible thought that you think you are the only Jews that have\nremained alive and I bet there\u2019s nobody else, so let\u2019s keep it a secret nobody has\nto know what we are. I remember telling this to my mother, don\u2019t tell nobody.\n31",
        "Q: Yet you left the camp. You went another direction?",
        "A: Yes. After that camp we went to Berlin.",
        "Q: Your mother was the leader of the pact.",
        "A: Oh, yes. She always was, she always thought with a clear head and she knew\nexactly and was an extremely brave woman. Such a brave woman that when I\nthink back at things that she did I don\u2019t know where she got authority. I\u2019ve never\ncome across anybody else like that. With such impact, with such go in her, like\nnothing could stop her. Yes, in times of desperation you pick up strength you\nnever knew you had and courage or you die from fear or else you turn the other\nway around and you become extremely courageous. Life is so important that you\nwill do anything to survive.",
        "Q: I would have loved to have met her.",
        "A: She was something. She was very, very loved, she had so many friends here.",
        "Q: And those who came to America and the three of you?",
        "A: Well the originally I did not want to come to America. My goal was to go to\nIsrael.",
        "Q: With the other kids?",
        "A: Well that wasn\u2019t with the other kids. I was in Germany at that time. This was\nalready almost four years later and I remember they were always coming from\nIsrael. They were coming to train us. To train us to become young soldiers. How\nto protect yourself, and I was going through all this training and I was ready to\nbecome a soldier.",
        "Q: You were seventeen years old.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t make no difference, I was ready to run away from my mother and to go\nthere, and she said \u201cyou\u2019re not going nowhere\u201d. And I remember a few of my\nfriends went on the ship Exodus and I was supposed to be on it and my mother\ncaught me the last minute. She said you are not going. After going through a war\nlike this you\u2019re not going to get shot by an Arab. We are going to America. At\nthat time, of course, I was trained Hebrew, I was taught Hebrew in Germany, it\nwas a language It was supposed to unite us all. I said, but I don\u2019t speak a word of\nEnglish but I do speak Hebrew, so I'll be at home in Israel and all my friends here\nfrom the camp are going and I want to go there too. My mother forbid me, you\nare not to go by yourself, we are all going together. We have relatives in America\nand this is where we are going. And sure enough we came here.\n32",
        "Q: Any regrets?",
        "A: No. I go to Israel every opportunity I have. I\u2019ve been there many times, at least a\nthousand.",
        "Q: Well, on behalf of the United States Holocaust Museum, I thank you for your time\nand for your story.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome.\n33\n"

        "A: Frania. Everybody called me Frania and I\u2019m being called by my friends that\nknow me from Europe still Frania.",
        "A: Prawer. That was pronounced Praver. Praver in Polish.",
        "A: Well, our first home that I recollect, which was a very tiny apartment, on Nilefke\n(?). We lived over there for awhile until my mother gave birth to my sister and I\nguess the apartment became too small and we moved to Moronovska 2 (?), and\n1\nwe lived there even while the ghetto started to be built. The Wall, which\nhappened to have been on the corner.",
        "A: Very small rooms, but they were like two small bedrooms, a living room and\nanother little room where my parents worked. They used to do ladies lingerie,\nlike piecework. They used to bring it home every morning and work until late at\nnight, and if they finished making the lingerie they would fold it up, put it in\nboxes and deliver them to a certain place where I suppose they paid them rather\nwell. Because from what I can recall now, that couldn\u2019t have been a very cheap\napartment. It was a brand new building when we moved in, it was a corner\nbuilding, we were on the fourth floor and everyone had a window, so I remember\nit being a lovely apartment.",
        "A: It was together with my mother. They worked together in the house. They had\nmachines and I remember them working until late hours at night. You know\nputting out their certain quotas that they used to bring in.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that they brought it to the stores themselves, they brought it back to\nthe people who gave them the pre-cut pieces. They just put them together, folded\nthem up and put them in the boxes and delivered them back to the places. I\nsuppose a factory or a warehouse and they, on the other hand, would sell it to the\nstores who sold it to clients.",
        "A: We were not religious. I remember Polish and Yiddish being spoken in the house.\nI don\u2019t even remember, too well, observing any of the holidays too well. I do not\nrecollect any specifics except for some minute little things, I guess it must have\nbeen maybe like Chanukah I would receive some gifts and I was told it was a\nJewish holiday, and I was told also there was a holiday, of course now I realize it\nwas Passover, where we couldn\u2019t eat bread. But, I didn\u2019t remember it too well. I\nremember eating something else beside bread. So this is all I have a recollection\nof actual holidays.",
        "A: Yes.\n2",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No. My father was born in Warsaw, my mother was born in Kovrin (?), in a small\ntown.",
        "A: My mother was always called Toby. I guess in every language it\u2019s still Toby. My\nfather was called, my mother had a name for him Srulik (?), she used to call him.\nHis Jewish name was Israel. I remember this mostly as Srulik I remember my\nmother calling his names. That\u2019s why this name was more outstanding than\nwhatever else other people called him. And his sisters in Israel also when they\ntalked about him it\u2019s always Srulik. That\u2019s how he was known. I guess it\u2019s an\nabbreviation of Israel.",
        "A: I did not go to any school. I never had a chance to go to school because the war\nbroke out, but my father gave me some education. We used to sit, he used to\nteach me how to read and write and I used to have to spend a certain amount of\ntime everyday looking, if it was an old book, or if 1t was just a page from\nsomething, whatever was readable material he made sure that I know how to read\nand write.",
        "A: In Polish only. Yes.",
        "A: Well, Yiddish I learned actually in the United States.",
        "A: I did not know a word of Yiddish until I came to this country and my mother\nmade me learn Yiddish because it was the only way she could correspond with me\nhere. She did not allow me to speak Polish in this country. She did not know too\nwell English, which I caught on within one year. I spoke English when I came\nhere, and for her it was more difficult and she used to speak Yiddish most of the\n3\ntime to all her friends and I guess in no time I learned the language and she would\ntalk to me in Yiddish and I would answer back in English or half Polish until after\nawhile I learned the language well.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s father, he came once, I remember seeing him once. He was a tall\nman with a beard. It must have been a special occasion and I think I wasn\u2019t more\nmaybe than three or four years old. It must have been my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nwedding when I saw him, was the only time I saw him. My grandmother died\nafter she gave birth to my mother\u2019s youngest brother, and my father\u2019s side, I don\u2019t\nremember a grandfather at all, but I do remember a grandmother, my father\u2019s\nmother living around the corner from us when we lived on Moronovska (?). It\nwas walking distance, but the woman was paralyzed. She lived there with my\nfather\u2019s oldest brother. His name was Shlamik (?), and she was in the last\nbedroom and I remember my father said every week we have to go and see\ngrandma. So that\u2019s , I remember just seeing her being ill in bed. She probably\nmust have had polio, I imagine.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Alive.",
        "A: Just to be alive. I was grateful. Nothing else and just to make sure there\u2019s always\nenough food. Never to go hungry again.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember too much from before the war. I was just a child playing. I had\nsome toys. Since one of my mother\u2019s sisters had a booth in a market, I guess it\nwas like a flea market at that time. Like an indoor flea market and she had a\nbooth. She would sell toys so she used to bring me certain things I would play\nwith and she told me not to break them because they would be resold tomorrow.\nNaturally I could never keep anything, but I played with a lot of things and then\nshe would carefully put them back in boxes and sold them.",
        "A: No. I remember also as I\u2019m talking to you, my biggest love, I remember, I was\nfive or maybe six or even younger, my father taking me to the movies to see\n4\nShirley Temple. I fell in love with her and at that time I used to go to see every\nShirley Temple movie.",
        "A: I loved to see movies, especially with Shirley Temple. They were the only\nmovies I ever saw was only when Shirley Temple appeared. Which, I guess, must\nhave been once a year or whenever",
        "A: Yes, they were dubbed.",
        "A: I never saw any other films. Those were the only ones. I must have seen maybe\ntwo or three Shirley Temple movies and they used to sell outside, when you\nwalked out of the movie theater, they used to sell little rings with her photograph\nthat used sort of flash like she would smile on those little pictures on the ring.\nThat was my biggest treasure.",
        "A: No. No, ,none whatsoever. I didn\u2019t know the meaning of it even.",
        "A: Yes. Very sheltered. I was very secure. I was a very happy child and having a\nlittle sister, you know, made my life complete, I guess. Somebody to play with.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Very easy going.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. It was very comfortable. I remember my relatives living very close\nby and we used to gather rather frequently. Visit each other. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat days or what evenings, but we were always not so much with friends; I don\u2019t\nremember my mother\u2019s friends or my father\u2019s friends, but I remember the\nrelatives always. Cousins, aunts, uncles.\n5",
        "A: No. I remember that in 1939, they were talking about a war that looks like it was\ngoing to be a war. I remember everybody being worried. I remember the look on\ntheir faces, they were very worried that there was going to be a war. Then of\ncourse all of a sudden we were covered with bombs. They started bombing\nWarsaw.",
        "A: I remember the outbreak of the war. I remember us running downstairs in a\nshelter in the basement of the building and hiding until the sirens blew and then\nyou could go upstairs again. And this happened quite a few times a day\nsometimes. It was very bad and we had very few close calls, but our building was\nnever hit. Not in 1939.",
        "A: When you say a battle ---",
        "A: I remember the wall being built and I remember people being squished into\nquarters. There were so many people in the streets at that time, they had to move\nfrom other areas to move to another area where we were all like closed in. It\u2019s\nlike 1f you have people scattered all over they took a certain section and they\nmade you move there. You had to find a room where to stay. People usually\nstayed with relatives. This did not last very long because the starvation came in\nvery soon after the water, gas and electricity was shut off, food was shut off. No\nnewspapers, no radios and starvation came in very fast. I remember every\nmorning I looked out my window I saw dead people downstairs. They used to\ncome around with wagons and pick them up.",
        "A: I saw them, it seems like, after the bombing. They were like animals running on\nthe motorcycles. I would see trucks. They made such noises that it frightened me\ntremendously. And everybody used to hide and run away, escape. They would\nhit people as would drive by or run over people. And I remember them as my\ninstinct told me this very cruel people, they are. And it\u2019s best to hide and not\nshow your face. I understood that immediately. Even though I saw my parents\ntalking quietly to each other, I suppose they were thinking what to do, where to\nget the next bite of food, but I saw them worried and I realized what it was.\n6",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I made plans. I remember my mother buying me a beautiful outfit. I think the\nsailor suit I was wearing in the picture. This must have been the picture. The\noutfit I was going to wear.",
        "A: There was a public school I would say about ten blocks away from us. We used\nto walk there. There was a park not too far from us. I remember my father used\nto take me for walks. We went to the movies, we used to go for ice cream, go\nwalking in the park and play and he passed by once pointing out to a building\nsaying, see, someday you'll go to this school right over here. So I remember it\nwas not far because we walked there.",
        "A: Yes, my father would be the one to take me for walks and explain to me, and tell\nme stories and things, sort of educating me.",
        "A: Yes. My father finished Gymnasia and I remember all the children of his family,\nbrothers and sisters were all educated.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but I did not understand certain languages that he spoke, but as\nyou can see he wrote German on the photographs. I suppose he must have known\nmore than two or three languages that I probably did not understand. I only spoke\nPolish. That was the only language I knew and everything else sounded like\nclatter to me.",
        "A: Everything was cut off.",
        "A: The business had ceased. Stopped right away. There was no need for it. It\nseemed like there was no money. There was nothing.\n7",
        "A: Trying to survive. We were very busy hiding in the shelters, getting food\ntogether, trying to sell off things and to buy maybe flour, maybe an apple.\nWhatever was available. Of course a lot of Poles were coming in to work in the\nghetto. There were factories, there were businesses and they would still be\ncoming in. They would smuggle in things, a lot of Jews would buy things off\nthem and give away a lot of precious things. They would give away art, they\nwould give away jewelry. They would give away whatever was precious for the\nslightest piece of food.",
        "A: Yes. I lived in the building and on the corner of that particular building the wall\nhad started, so I was watching the bricks going up. Men were working over there,\nwhich I didn\u2019t understand at first why they\u2019re closing off. In other words our\nbuilding was on the inside of the ghetto which was the last building by the wall. I\nremember that and I remember them putting, the wall was so high, 1t seemed so\nhigh to me, they were putting broken glass, I remember the smashing of bottles\nand glass putting on the top of the wall.",
        "A: It did not take long at all. It seemed it grew by a foot or two or whatever.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know who. I saw men working. I don\u2019t know if they were Poles or Jews.\nI don\u2019t know, but I saw men working and the Germans watching.",
        "A: They were German soldiers watching, standing with guns and civilians were\nworking, and I don\u2019t know who they were.",
        "A: The date? I cannot give you a date.",
        "A: I guess it was all the same time, the very beginning, during the bombing and\nthat\u2019s when the wall started. They must have decided right then and there. The\nbombs will stop, you know, start building the wall.\n8",
        "A: Yes, we stayed in our apartment.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, you did not go out in public. You were afraid to go out. You never knew\nwhen the Germans would come through the gate and attack and capture people.\nAnd a lot of people were captured. I remember seeing children dying and\nbegging for food. I also remember my father taking me to a woman who myself\nand four other little girls we used to be taught how to read and write. So he used\nto take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take\nanother little girl, I don\u2019t know who she was, maybe she was a neighbor, and take\nus to this woman who used to teach us how to read and write for about, this went\non for six months. I would say I was being taught to read and write for the first six\nmonths maybe. And even that stopped because I was beaten up once in the street.\nI was wearing a little jacket and somebody wanted my jacket so they ripped my\njacket off and they hit me and I came home bleeding and this was the end of my\neducation, I guess.",
        "A: Yes. You don\u2019t go out anymore. Because at that time even there were hours,\nthere were times you knew when you were safe to go out in the street. And she\nwas only like maybe about a block away, I remember it was only about a five\nminute walk. So that\u2019s the reason why my father would take me or pick me up or\nI would walk back. And that was the end of that.",
        "A: Yes, inside the ghetto.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the face. I know I remember somebody hitting me and ripping\noff my jacket and I had something in my hand, maybe it was a little briefcase or\nsomething was grabbed. Maybe somebody who was starving, maybe he thought I\nhad food. Maybe his child was cold and he needed a jacket or something so he\ntook it off me.\n9",
        "A: So he got it, yes.",
        "A: Yes, it was in the ghetto. You saw a lot of these things happening. You were\nafraid to carry something. If you had something to carry, you usually carried it\ninside your coat so nobody would detect it, or else you were attacked by other\npeople if they suspect you have food on you, they\u2019d do anything. I guess when\nyour stomach is growling and you\u2019re starving you know no honor, you know no\nshame, you know nothing, you just know one thing, you have to eat.",
        "A: No. I did not have to wear anything. After that incident I was never allowed\nanymore to go outside anymore.",
        "A: Yes, when my father went out he put on the armband and the minute he entered\nthe building, he would take it off. Just in case somebody spots him, he had to\nwear it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember my mother. I guess she must have worn it also. I don\u2019t\nremember her putting it on or taking it off. Maybe she did it outside when she left\nthe apartment. It was something you did not wear with pride, so like you didn\u2019t\nwant even your own children to see this so no questions would be asked. But I\nsaw people wearing them. I didn\u2019t ask because I think I knew what the answer\nwas going to be so I didn\u2019t ask too many questions. I was very silent.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well the only time it was when they closed the ghetto and as I said the factory\nstill continued and she got a job there. A very prestigious job. But this took a\nwhile until she went out on the Polish side and she was in contact with the other\nPoles about papers. She got alien papers that she was not Polish, she was\n10\nUkrainian. Those were the papers she was given and her name was Ana\nGregorief (?). I will never forget that because she spoke Russian. She did not\ncome from Warsaw so her Polish had a very bad accent. And, therefore, to make\nsure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian. Then it\u2019s\nOK to have an accent. So she became Ana Gregorief and paid a fortune for these\npapers and as Ana Gregorief she got the job in the ghetto so she could go in and\ngo out and she would bring in food.",
        "A: She had to go in and she had to go out. She could go in and go out, she had a\nspecial passport. The factory was like going around the clock. This was not a\nnine to five job. They were in a rush to make these uniforms or whatever they\nwere doing over there.",
        "A: Yes, the factory where they were making uniforms, maybe they were making\nother things. She never discussed what they were doing there.",
        "A: No, but I remember her once, she came in, but this was a long time, much later,\n1943 already when she brought in a suitcase into the apartment and there were\nuniforms on the top and when she picked up the uniforms I remember seeing\nguns. Long shotguns and boxes I guess must have been bullets. She was bringing\nit into the ghetto from the Polish side because they were talking about an uprising.",
        "A: Yes, she smuggled in several times, and of course she carried the suitcase as if it\nweighed only twenty pounds and it could have weighed over a hundred pounds.\nThat\u2019s how she got all dressed up so people would never dare, or the Germans\nnever dared to question her. She would just show them the flashed Ana\nGregorian, her name, her special pass that she could go in and go out and that\u2019s\nhow she got away.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any names.",
        "A: I never saw the factory. The only time I ever saw was the time she brought the\nsuitcase when she brought once. I said what are these uniforms and she said these\nbelong to the factory. That\u2019s all I remember her saying. I don\u2019t know if this was\n11\nthe factory or another factory. I don\u2019t even know where she worked. There was\nno conversation, there was nothing was talked about so my sister and I could hear.\nMy father and mother when they talked nobody else could hear a word they were\nsaying. She didn\u2019t want us to know anything.",
        "A: Yes. She would go in, she would go out she would like to go back and forth. She\nhad the permission to go back and forth.",
        "A: She also brought food. So we had food and nobody bothered her. Because\nnobody after awhile knew who she was. As people were dying out and, of course\nthe crowds in the very beginning were all gone already and there were very few\npeople now in the streets and those that survived already at that point were hidden\nin their apartments or in basements trying to scrounge food, together mainly. The\nghetto was getting smaller at that point, we had moved several times already.",
        "A: Oh, yes, we were forced out of the apartment and they said we have to move. My\nmother at that time would say, we\u2019re going to move to a much nicer place. She\nstill tried to protect us that we should not know what\u2019s going on. We were like in\nthe blind in a way because she never wanted to reveal to us what was going on at\nthat time. But I remember moving and then again moving and then again moving.\nWe were constantly on the go.",
        "A: No, they were not. They were just temporary quarters. We would walk into a\nbuilding and we would be the only ones in an entire building. We could take any\napartment, so we would run to a building that was not bombed and there were\nempty apartments. Every floor we looked in all over, we looked for food. There\nwas nothing there and we just slept anywhere.",
        "A: She would bring maybe a potato, she would bring flour, some kind of a vegetable,\na lot of fruit, a piece of bread, a piece of salami once she brought in. It was\nscrounged together, I guess, like leftovers they looked like more. It was not like\nyou went to a store and you bought it. She would ask the workers maybe they had\nleftovers from lunch, whatever it was, those were the leftovers she would buy it\nfrom them.\n12",
        "A: I was a picky eater, yes I was a very picky eater.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. He was watching my sister and me while my mother was the one looking\nvery Polish. Because as you can see on the photograph she did not resemble a\nJew. That\u2019s the reason why she got away. So she would get dressed up, she\nbought herself a coat, a hat to make sure she looked as elegant as possible.\nBecause if you look ragged you know, you would have been stopped right away.\nLike this if you walked with your head up high and very positive nobody bothered\nyou. I guess your attitude was very important. That\u2019s why she survived.",
        "A: Well, he was watching us and he also kept an eye on his mother, his relatives, we\nwere still in contact in the beginning, we\u2019re still in contact with them.",
        "A: In the original ghetto. When the ghetto got smaller, my grandmother must have\ndied because I never heard about her again or maybe she was shot, I don\u2019t know,\nand neither were her uncles. Like nobody had remained. It was just my father,\nmy mother and the two of us. We were kept on the move. And then after awhile\nwe found out that one of his brothers was nearby when my mother said would try\nto find her. She\u2019ll go into the building and would try to find her. We found her,\nwe found only my father\u2019s sister-in-law, my aunt. She had given birth to a baby\nat that ttme. She was there with an infant. The infant was crying and we heard\nlike an echo, the ghetto was so empty. We heard the echo and we heard German\nvoices. We heard shotguns and we saw my aunt was thrown out of the window.\nShe was on the sidewalk and the baby was ripped in half was also on the\nsidewalk.",
        "A: I did not see, my father saw and my mother saw. We were hidden, at that time we\nwere hidden in a basement so I did not see anything what was going on the\noutside.\n13",
        "A: Yes. This I remember my father and my mother, my father crying terribly.\nA; Yes, torn, it was a newborn infant.",
        "A: Crying and then a silence. And if somebody marched blocks away you could hear\nthe footsteps. Especially German footsteps. You could hear German cars, trucks\nor motorcycles. It was a dead silence. Nobody even breathed so you are not\ndiscovered. At that time you are already hidden in ghetto and the building that we\nwere there were quite a few people with us. I would say about twenty people\nwere together and this is when the conversation started with the uprising. And\nthen other people came and we were all like together in this one particular area\nand they started talking. You know, there were very few of us left, that something\nshould be done and this is where my mother started bringing in the guns.\nWhatever should be done and this is when my mother began bringing in the guns.\nWhatever we need to do, she said, first we need to shoot our way out.",
        "A: Yes. I was very afraid. I didn\u2019t know what the next hour was going to bring. If\nwe will be discovered. My biggest fear was if someone will put a gun against my\nhead and shoot, because I\u2019ve seen so may to others and it looks so terrifying, this\nwas my biggest fear. It was bigger than starvation even.",
        "A: Oh yes. I saw people shot, oh yes.",
        "A: People I knew? Even if people I knew I probably would not have recognized\nthem. People looked very different during the war. They became extremely\nskinny, they ages, they were very ragged looking, very dirty. There was no water.\nIf there would be no rain, we would never have nothing to drink. So even if\nsomebody was shot, I did not know who they were. I didn\u2019t know anybody. I\ndidn\u2019t recognize anyone. I just saw their brains being shot out.",
        "A: On the street. Running. If you were running they would grab somebody and\nshoot them right in the head. If it was a child, or a woman, it made no difference,\nand leave them. And then there would be somebody to come with a little wagon\npicking up bodies. The bodies piling up and taking them someplace.\n14",
        "A: This went on until the plans were made for the Jewish uprising. Which was, I\nwould say, 1943. Since 1939. At that point when my mother knew there was\ngoing to be an uprising, she made arrangements for my sister and myself to be\ntaken out of the ghetto and taken by the Poles, one family was called Doblinkov\n(?) and whom I was held in their home. I was taken out, smuggled out of there.",
        "A: No, not by my mother, the Poles with a truckload of merchandise went out and we\nwere hidden on the truck and then we were supposed to be dropped off at a certain\npoint, we jumped off the truck and they were waiting for us. Two people were\nwaiting for us, one took my sister, one took me. I didn\u2019t know the whereabouts of\nmy sister and this was the last time I saw my parents. And we stayed with the\nDoblinkov (?) family which was about, quite a ride with the trolley. At that time,\non the Polish side, the trolleys were going. So we were changing trolleys and\ngoing like to the outskirts of Warsaw and I saw a very little, private little cottage,\na little house. This is where I was brought in by this man. He had a daughter\nabout a year or two older than myself and a son about a year or two younger than\nme. And he introduced me to the family that I am going to live with them and I\nand their mother\u2019s sister\u2019s daughter who died so they are to take care of me and I\ncome from another town. I don\u2019t remember. Lodz or Krakow, or whatever.\nThey picked a city and said this is where I come from and this is going to be my\nname and this is where I\u2019m going to stay. My name was Yasha.",
        "A: Yes, I became Yasha Doblinkov. And they said this is where I am to stay and this\nis going to be my family. And I had to adjust to that instantly. The first thing, I\nwas very happy, they gave me food. They gave me, I remember, a giant bowl of\npotatoes, mashed potatoes and I think I finished it. It was I think maybe five\npounds and I finished it all. And they gave me a glass of milk, which is\nsomething I had not seen in years, since before the war. That was good. So I\nthink they got through to me through my stomach.",
        "A: I have never seen them, I have never known them.",
        "A: Yes. I was very skinny and she said to me, I am going to fatten you up. Don\u2019t\nworry you\u2019re going to look very nice.\n15",
        "A: Yes. Of course when the uprising started, which did not last very long. After that\nall of ghetto was burning. It was aflame. One giant flame and she took me\noutdoors and she said to me, you know, this is where you come from and this is\nwhere your parents are. And I remember remarking the sky was so red, like\nblood, it looked like and it was towards evening. And she said to me, you will\nnever see your parents again. They perished in the fire. So you are going to stay\nwith us. I am going to take you to church. You\u2019re going to go through a\nCommunion. You'll become a Christian and you\u2019ll become part of my family and\nwe will treat you equally with my children. I started to cry. I wanted to see my\nmommy and I wanted to see my daddy and I didn\u2019t want to live with them. I\ndidn\u2019t want to go to a church. But she said, if you are not going to obey we will\nhave to take you back where you came from. So I just closed my mouth. I shut up\nand I didn\u2019t say another word. I just did whatever they told me to do.",
        "A: And | ate the food, yes, and they gave me a little bed in the corner to sleep.",
        "A: They put a cross on me, yes. They put the cross on me a very short time after\nthat. They said to me you are going to church so you must wear a cross and I did\nnot take that cross off until six months after the war. This was I felt like my, in a\nway I wasn\u2019t hungry anymore since I wore the cross. So I felt that this maybe\nprotected me from starvation. And they said if you wear the cross you will never\nbe hungry and you will always have a roof over your head and we are going to be\nyour family because you have nobody else",
        "A: Oh, for a few months, I would say, quite a few months. At that point already, I\nrealized that my mother and my father are gone. I didn\u2019t realize, of course, that\nmy father was captured. Right during the uprising he was captured taking\n, my mother, of course, head out. She was still in the ghetto for\nquite some time and the way she got out is a whole story by itself. It was very\nmiraculous. At that time she did not look so elegant, she did not look so\nglamorous as she did just a couple of months before that. She was hungry, she\nwas tired, she lost a husband in that time and she changed tremendously and the\nfew people that did survive were in the sewers for quite some time and then when\nthey got on the other side, that\u2019s the reason why it took such a time, until she\nfinally one evening just knocked on the door and came to the Doblinkov family\nand when I saw her, to me it was like a new world had opened up. I never\nbelieved I\u2019d ever see her again.\n16",
        "A: They were going to be my parents, I had to mentally adjust myself that this is it. I\nam most probably stay with them. I never thought that my mother was going to\nmarch in through the door.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Immediately I ran to her arms and I wouldn\u2019t let go. I held onto her\ndress. She took me by the hand, she took a few things and said that some of the\npeople gave them something when we walked out. We had a car waiting outside.\nI don\u2019t know if it was some kind of taxi, or somebody doing my mother a favor or\nwhatever. Whoever it was, I don\u2019t know. All I know I was so happy looking and\nstaring at my mother\u2019s face, I couldn\u2019t believe that she was there and then we\ndrove for about fifteen minutes to another building where I had to sit in the car\nand she brought my sister down all wrapped up in a blanket and it seemed like\nthey were starving my sister because she looked terrible. She was all swollen\nwith no clothes on, frozen and it was very cold and my mother wrapped her up in\nthe blanket and came running down angrily what they had done to her child in\nthose few months only.",
        "A: I saw her only one time when that family has written a letter to the Doblinkov\nfamily that they have the other sister and they probably want to know, maybe they\ncan get rid of her and send her to me. So there was an address and I said to my\n, Lused to call her my aunt, I said to my Aunt Doblinkov, I said can I\nplease see my sister? I had five minutes. So, I remember going on a trolley and\nher daughter went with me and we went upstairs and I only had five minutes and I\nremember my sister laying over there in bed and Mrs. Doblinkov gave a piece of\nsalami and a piece of bread to give it to my sister. So when I came in I gave this\nto her and she was very cold and the woman was standing there and watching. I\ngave her the food and she hid it under the blanket and I stood there helpless not\nknowing what to do. I saw that she was dying, that she was starving and there\nwas nothing I could do about it. And the woman said, OK., your time is up you\ngot to leave. I said I just want to sit with my sister a little more. No, she said, you\nhave to go. Lady, I said, I want to be with her. She said no, leave and I had to\nleave. I left her the food and when I came back to Mrs. Doblinkov she asked\nabout my sister. I said she is very, very hungry. I\u2019ve known children that look\nlike her they usually die right after that. She said there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\nI cannot help her.\n17",
        "A: Snatched her out in the nick of time, and she was dying. As a matter of fact, she\ndid not grow for five years, not one inch, after that incident. After those few\nmonths of the starvation I guess this is what happens to children. The lack of\neverything. My mother was very frightened that she\u2019ll be a midget, she was so\ntiny. Not until we came to the United States she started growing.\nSIDE 2.",
        "A: A very nice apartment.",
        "A: In Warsaw on the Dobra Street, which was right across from the Vislag (?) River.",
        "A: As Poles, yes. We lived as Poles. We all had our papers. I had my ;",
        "A: Not as a prisoner, but asking them what sizes they are, what kind of uniforms they\nwant. So she could make them up custom made for the upper echelon type of\ngenerals. This was one time when she saw my father very briefly, from a\ndistance.",
        "A: She saw my father from a distance, and she whispered to him, of course nobody\ncould see, you got a chance, you can put on one of those uniforms and you can\nescape. He says I cannot run even, how can I escape? You go, save yourself and\nsave the children, forget about me. And this was the last she saw him. But there\nwas another man that did run away with her. Went along with her on the truck.\nThis is the man that has written a book and he has written about this whole\n18\nepisode in the book. His name is Cheslov (?). I don\u2019t know if this man is alive or\nnot, and I have the book that he has written. There is a whole chapter about my\nmother. And after she took him out she brought him on Dobra Street. She\nbrought him into the apartment and we held him there for awhile. Then the\nfollowing week, she went to another camp and she brought in two sisters she took\nout, two women that she said she needed them as assistants. They let them out,\nshe brought them and she brought them to the apartment also. And one night the\nGermans were knocking at the door. The two sisters were caught and they were\ntaken out. This man went out the window and he was not captured.",
        "A: Yes, he was not captured. And they left with the two sisters, they left.",
        "A: No. They, I don\u2019t remember what was the story, she just must have told them that\nmaybe they knocked on the door and she let them in. They just came in, they just\nwalked in, or something, some kind of an excuse. She made believe she doesn\u2019t\nknow them. It\u2019s not like this was an old friendship or something. That she did it\nintentionally. Seems like these two women just walked in and they asked to sleep\nover maybe, or they asked for something, so they let us alone.",
        "A: The last time I would say a year before the war ended, maybe less. Maybe it was\nless than when the war ended. She said he looked terrible.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: My father? In Miedniewice.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I know she went to several camps. She never discussed anything\nwith me or my sister. She never told us very much. She would say I have to go\naway and I\u2019ll be back in a few days. That\u2019s all we knew. We never questioned\nher. She would say you are not to leave the house and you are not to leave the\napartment. Keep it locked at all times, and that\u2019s how it was.\n19",
        "A: No, no. We were there ourselves.",
        "A: She told us that a long time afterwards.",
        "A: No. We knew, I sensed that something was wrong when she came back. She did\nnot sleep, she talked to herself, she was shouting, she was crying and I knew\nsomething was wrong, but she didn\u2019t want to tell us what it was. It was only\nyears after when she told us. I saw him from a distance, I would have never\nrecognized him in a million years if he stood a foot in front of me, but he\nrecognized me. So he called out my name and I saw him.",
        "A: He recognized my mother first. She did not know where the voice was coming\nfrom. She would not have known it was him. All she told him I can save you. If\nPll throw you the uniform, put it on and walk out, march out like a German. And\nhe was like behind a fence and she was on this side of the fence. There were a lot\nof fences. There were men standing there with those striped uniforms and she\ntried to save him, which I think would have been hopeless anyway, so he was\nafraid that he\u2019s going to jeopardize her life, so he says no, no. He did not want to\ngo. In a way she could not forgive herself seeing him and yet maybe she could\nhave helped him as a Ukrainian but he didn\u2019t want to jeopardize her life. He\ndidn\u2019t want to go.",
        "A: Yes. It was just the beginning of the uprising.",
        "A: The very beginning of the uprising.\n20",
        "A: What she did during the uprising? I guess she was fighting like the handful of\npeople that were there. They were fighting until there were very few people left.\nShe said it was a glorious fight. It was glorious. So they gave her a reason to live\nagain. There was a thread of hope, of course. They knew they cannot do very\nmuch but just to give the Germans something back. A little revenge for all the\naches and pains they caused everybody.",
        "A: Oh, this was through the sewers, this took time, this took time, until she finally\ngot out of there. They could not escape, they put the gas in the sewers, they made\nsure that nobody can escape, there were dogs all over. They had to be at a hideout\nfor quite some time until they could get out from wherever they were hiding until\nit became clearer that she could get out of there. But this took awhile, because\nthey were on the lookout. They knew that whoever survived this uprising would\nwant to escape because there was nothing else left there. It was a handful of\nheroic people and they\u2019re not ready to give up. So even the sewers you couldn\u2019t\ngo, it was all gas there. They would have gotten poisoned. So they had to wait\nprobably until it was o.k. to find a way to leave.",
        "A: No, I think they could not go in groups. Everybody went their own way, because\nin a group it is more dangerous. Singularly it always easier to escape when a\nsingle person runs. I don\u2019t know, maybe they started as a group and they wound\nup individually, I don\u2019t know. She never talked about that particular incident. It\nwas a very painful incident in her life. Very painful. And even though she used to\ntalk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small ghetto,\nat one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I\nwere gone and my father was gone. It seems like the Germans came, they were\ncoming and they said we\u2019re going to put the building on fire whoever\u2019s there\ndoesn\u2019t run away or doesn\u2019t give themselves up they\u2019re going to get burned alive.\nSo I don\u2019t know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my\nfather, where was my father, I\u2019m trying to think, he was also gone in the morning.\nHe did not go to work, but my mother went to work and he went someplace and\nmy sister and I were left alone. And when the Germans came, we looked at each\nother, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace. So, we went\ndownstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall\nthere to go to the next building and the next building, so we escaped through a\nfew other buildings. They were also empty, so we didn\u2019t know what had\nhappened to the building we were originally. I don\u2019t know if they put it on fire or\nthey didn\u2019t put it. But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another\n21\nbuilding and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to\napartment which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere. We turned\nquietly every drawer and every closet, we looked all over and then we hear\nGermans marching downstairs and they\u2019re entering the building and here\u2019s my\nsister and I alone in this apartment and it\u2019s all empty. I remember I took her and I\nput her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet. I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet\nand I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest\nthat stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest. I squished in the\nback of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in\nthey\u2019 ll think there are rags there. And I took a blanket and covered myself and\nthe two of us stayed there. We heard the German footsteps and we heard them\ngetting closer and closer and then they kicked open the door and they marched in\nthis apartment. They must have been looking for Jews from apartment to\napartment. This was their preoccupation and that\u2019s how I know this, and they\nwalked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns. They were shooting\nin every apartment. All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting. I\nguess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them\nor something. So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I\nheard them talking loud and clear I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying.\nThen I heard them walk out. And when they walked out and they left the door,\nmy first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister\u2019s name, are you alive? She says Yes,\nare you alive? I said yes. So we got together again, she came out of the cabinet\nand we decided we\u2019re going to hide in the attic. From now on it was no good in\nthe apartment because they are shooting and they may shoot us. So we\u2019ll go in\nthe attic. We go all the way up in the attic and there\u2019s a lot of furniture and we\nhear voices. So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were\npeople hidden in the attic. We started moving the furniture away and the people\noutside didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let\nus in, let us in, we got to hide with you. So my sister said, well, I\u2019m going to cry\nso loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I\u2019m going to tell them that\nyou\u2019re hiding there, so let us in there. We came in over there, we sat with them,\nthey had water, so we drank a little water with them.",
        "A: I had no idea. We just walked in. There were about three or four people there. It\nlooked like older people, maybe at that time, maybe they were in their 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s,\n60\u2019s. I don\u2019t know I couldn\u2019t even judge the age. We stayed with them for a few\ndays and then we left them, and we were going from building to building, we got\nto find our parents, where are our parents, we had no idea. And from one of the\nbuildings we saw there were schlep carts and we saw people gathering and the\ntwo of us would look out the window, you know hidden behind the curtain, to\nmake sure we don\u2019t see our mother or our father. I didn\u2019t know what to look for.\nI didn\u2019t see them. So, I said, you see they did not get caught, they didn\u2019t get\ncaught they must be someplace. Don\u2019t you think my mother came around. She\n22\nwalked also from building to building yelling quietly, Frania, Chaja, just like an\necho from the distance it sounded like. So she found us.",
        "A: And my father must have gone to work also that day. My mother went to work,\nmy father went also to do something. Maybe to look for food.",
        "A: Like sometimes, depending. They were always very busy, they were always\ndoing something.",
        "A: I guess whatever labor they gave you. They didn\u2019t ask you what your talents\nwere. They needed somebody. I guess like today, you know, people want a job,\nwhatever they\u2019ll tell them to do they\u2019ll do, so there was no question of asking\nwhat your talents are or what you specialize, I\u2019ll do anything.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Not long before. This was in a small ghetto. This was when we had an\napartment , when we were staying there for awhile.",
        "A: No, the Morenovska, we were gone already. This was like the third or the fourth\napartment already, that we were on the go. So we were like constantly like\ngypsies on the go running. The minute we were afraid maybe they heard\nfootsteps, we would leave the building already. We were afraid to stay in the\nsame place three or four nights that\u2019s it and you had to be on the move.",
        "A: Yes. This was up until, I would say, the last few weeks before we went to the\nDoblenkov\u2019s. Then we were like more settled with other people. All of a sudden\nI saw a lot of other people. I don\u2019t remember their faces, but I remember there\nwere quite a few people there and they were talking constantly and making plans\nand they would tell us, there were a few children, go sit on the side, go away, not\nto bother anybody, and they were making their plans. So we were there for a\nwhile. Once they made up, I guess, a date when they\u2019re going to start this. This\nis when my mother made up her mind to get me and my sister, to get us on the\nPolish side so we\u2019re not going to get caught.\n23",
        "A: On Dobra Street?",
        "A: Yes. It did not take very long, I heard shooting in the streets and my mother came\nrunning in like she was being chased for G-d knows how many blocks or miles\nand when she came in she says would you believe that the Russians were\nsupposed to come and they\u2019re not coming, they\u2019re on the other side, on the Prague\nside, and they\u2019re not crossing the river and they told the Poles to start. This was\nthe first time she talked to me, and she says and the Poles are starting an uprising\nnow. So we\u2019re going to get caught now in the middle of their uprising.",
        "A: Immediately. We had to leave right away. They made announcements.\nEverybody to leave the buildings. Everybody to go. They\u2019re going to shoot every\nPole that\u2019s going to stay here and help the Russians to cross.",
        "A: On the Dobro Street? A few months.\nQ; Just a few months?",
        "A: Just ac few months, yes. Then we had the uprising again and we were on the go\nagain. And I remember my mother burying a suitcase. She says one thing I don\u2019t\nwant to carry with me is luggage. Let\u2019s bury it in the basement, we\u2019ll come back\nif we ever survive the war we\u2019re going to take out my little treasures, pictures,\nletters, addresses of relatives in Israel, relatives in the United States.",
        "A: No, no. She couldn\u2019t care less about it. It was a nuisance. It was a tremendous\nnuisance. They started burning buildings and chasing the Poles and running\nthrough the streets and the buildings were all burning and they were chasing.\nAlso I remember running for about twenty blocks and the last few blocks the\nbuildings were ablaze and we couldn\u2019t crossing. We couldn\u2019t go through\nanymore. There was a church and they made us all, quite a few hundred, pushed\ninto this church.",
        "A: Yes, all the Poles pushed into this church. My mother made sure ----\n24",
        "A: Oh yes. We had Polish papers and nobody knew otherwise. We were right at the\ndoor. At the door or there was a window, some kind of exit even if we were\nlocked in we would be able to get out, because my mother said I have a feeling\nthey\u2019re going to do something to us. They\u2019re going to, she thought they\u2019re going\nto put the poison gas and they\u2019re going to poison everybody there. We didn\u2019t\nknow they were going to put it on fire. So we just broke through the glass and\npeople started panicking. They were breaking all the like stained glass, whatever\nthere was there. People started climbing from the windows and running and\njumping into the flames and we ran. At that point we ran with the fire on both\nsides. My mother grabbed me and my sister. I don\u2019t remember how far, I was\nlike in a daze, we just ran until finally it was a clearance and all the people that\ncame out into a clearance, the Germans were there and there was a train and we\nall were pointed to get on the train and my mother saw a train and she was like\npetrified. She says oh, my G-d, we\u2019re going to a concentration camp. She\nalready knew at that point that all trains were going only in one direction. But it\ndid not go to a concentration camp, it went to another camp, some kind of camp, a\ndetention camp where as Poles we were held over there, but there were not like\nguards, they gave us to eat, they gave us cots to sleep on and we had like a army\nblanket even to cover ourselves and I remember that my mother said, this is no\ngood, I don\u2019t like this business here, you know, with the Poles they\u2019re going to do\nsomething with them also. It\u2019s mostly women and children here. The men, they\nwere shooting them like dogs. And we escaped. We were not there very long, we\nescaped.",
        "A: No. [I have no idea.",
        "A: We started running. Most of the time we were hiding out during the day and we\nwere on foot at night. And we went through towns and villages all on foot and we\nstopped at different, and I remember my mother saying, if we\u2019re going to walk in\nthis direction another twenty kilometers there\u2019s a small town I know some people\nthere. We\u2019ll go there and when we made it over there, we stayed with them, I\nthink for about two nights, and we heard the Germans outside so we ran out to the\nback, the three of us escaped. And we were on the run continuously on the run\nuntil I don\u2019t know for how long on foot until we came to this primitive little\nvillage where only farms, like small little straw roof type of little huts. People\nlived like that and we were all very ragged, and my mother marched into these\nhouses, claiming some kind of accident, something happened and we needed\nrefuge for just a few days. And when they asked us where we come from. We\nsaid we come from Warsaw. She said, oh, she heard about Warsaw, can you tell\n25\nus stories about it. She says if you let me sleep here, I'll tell you all the stories\nyou want to know. They heard about wagons going on electric. This was all\nprimitive, and when I think back, my G-d like a few hundred years behind times.",
        "A: Real peasants. Good natured, nice people, that were afraid of their own shadows.\nThey knew there was a war, because the Germans came and took away most of\ntheir cattle, and took away whatever they had. They were constantly coming and\ntook away their wheat and their corn, whatever they were growing.",
        "A: We were there in the winter. We were there until the Russians came into this\nvillage. That\u2019s how long we were there.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I remember the day they marched in I don\u2019t remember the date,\nbecause I think we were all in a state of shock.",
        "A: I remember it being cold. I don\u2019t know if it was the beginning, the end or the\nmiddle of winter, but I remember it being very cold. When the Russians came in\nmy mother started talking Russian to them. She could not get over that they came\nin, and the first question she had for them, did you hear of a Bernard Friedman,\nmy brother is in Russia, maybe he is in the army? Well after awhile we found a\nJewish Russian soldier who was a Jew. He was very nice. As the Russians came\nin and the war is over, and they said they are chasing the Germans are just in front\nof them and they were passing with tanks which were so loud and we packed up\nour few little belongings and they did not mind taking us, jumping in the truck\nand taking us along, a part of a truck and part we sat on a tank. Just to get out of\nthis village, and we wanted to go to any town and as we were going through on\nthese vehicles we saw the Germans hanging from trees. Which was some sight to\nsee.",
        "A: They were hanging some by the legs, some by the neck, some by the hands.\nSome by one foot. They just hung them live. They were hanging live there. As\nthey turned around, they were practice shooting with them. They took guns, they\nwere shooting at them and they were jumping on their ropes, and they were\nyelling in Russian, this is for my mother and this is for my father, what you did to\nmy country to my Mother Russia. For the millions you\u2019ve killed. You know.\nAnd this is what they were yelling at. Even I understood the few words in\n26\nRussian. I didn\u2019t know Russian, but I understood those few words, it was very\nsimilar to Polish.",
        "A: I was glad. I was very glad. I hated the Germans so much with such passion that\nI think if they cut them alive, it would not have bothered me. On the contrary, I\nthink I would have found some kind of satisfaction.",
        "A: My mother went into a shock. She actually went into a shock because after a\nshort while after she got very sick. And they told her that she was in a shock. I\ndon\u2019t think it was a stroke, it was some kind of a shock she went into. When we\ncame into one of the cities, we passed by a city, I don\u2019t even know what big city\nwe passed by, she went to a hospital. I was there sitting and they told her they\nhave to treat her for a few days. And I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her.\nBut I remember my sister and I sitting and waiting for her to get well, because we\ncouldn\u2019t go anyplace without her. This was it, you know. She got well after a\nfew days and I remember she became very calm. She was not as wild as she was\nduring the war. She would do crazy things. She would jump, and run, and lift\nand pick. But here after she got sick, we were released, I guess from the German\nagony, I guess you never thought the end was going to come. Every day was a\nyear, you\u2019re talking about five long miserable years, miserable years.",
        "A: That took also quite a few months.",
        "A: It was warm. I know it was warm because from the fire it was hot, or something,\nor the people in trains. But I was warm.",
        "A: We were shivering. If we could steal something to wear or if we saw a body we\nwould rip off something to wear. I wore maybe a hundred different kinds of\nshoes. Whatever I could find, I had no shoes at all. Most of the time my mother\nwanted me to be very quiet when I walked so she made me walk without shoes.\nAnd I shouldn\u2019t knock. But we used to always find something on ways. We\nfound rags. Once we passed a small river, so my mother washed my face, she\nsaid my G-d, I forgot what you looked like. I was black from mud, from\ncrawling, from hiding,\n27",
        "A: No. Once my mother took me out from the Doblinkov family. I was not a\nDoblinkov anymore. I had those papers like this. The only thing was she claimed\nthat she adopted a daughter, I was a relative\u2019s daughter and she adopted me. So\nthat\u2019s the reason why she and I had two different names.",
        "A: No, once in the primitive village, we didn\u2019t need any papers or anything. Nobody\nquestioned us, nobody knew from anything anymore. It was like I said, they\ndidn\u2019t even know anything exists. You know, from a clock, they knew nothing.",
        "A: They heard about people that were Jews and they heard, they\u2019re supposed to look\nout for them because they are very cruel and very mean and you can usually tell\njust by looking at them. That was a propaganda, of course. Oh, if you see a Jew\nyou'll know right away, he\u2019ll look subhuman, first of all.",
        "A: Not in that way, no. They were just vicious and they were ugly and they tried to\nsteal from you whatever you had. They tried to connive you whatever you had.",
        "A: Yes. It shows you this was in the schools. The children were taught like that. The\nchildren were taught, the Polish children were taught, they would make a picture\nof this, I don\u2019t know, a witch I guess they would pick, and they would say this is\nwhat a Jew looks like. And it is the biggest honor to find one, and if you want to\nkill them yourself, it\u2019s o.k., and if you want to give him to us, we\u2019ll kill him.",
        "A: No. They never saw one. They only know from what they heard. Don\u2019t forget,\nthe war was on for quite a few years already at that point and they knew nothing\nof what was going on in the outside their village.\n28",
        "A: And they thought that we were very fancy people from Warsaw after we washed\nup. They realized that they called my mother. In Polish there\u2019s an expression,\n\u201cPania (?) Intelligencia\u201d that means you are a lady pf intelligence.",
        "A: Of intellect and, therefore, if we have any questions they would ask her when\nChristmas comes out, when the holidays. Of course, they have no calendar, no\nclock, nothing, no radio. Didn\u2019t know anything. If I thought , and they\ngave us this tiny little room that was supposed to have been an attached bathroom\noriginally, just some boards. This is where we slept. So they knew nothing about\nJews if they hit them over the head, probably. Luckily, they were very nice to us,\nThey gave us food, we ate with them and my mother helped them with the farm,\nwith the work and I did some work. I would sweep and clean and grow things.\nWhatever she told me to do, we would do it.",
        "A: Again?",
        "A: Right after the war we returned to Warsaw, my mother wanted to get that\nbriefcase.",
        "A: Nothing. Rubbles. All rubbles you couldn\u2019t even tell if a building was once\nstanding. It was all burned down and we went to Berlin. We stayed in Berlin for\nabout six months and we were in Berlin we tried to get to the American side\nbecause we were told it was best from the Russian side with the Russians,\neventually, like with cars, trucks, trains until we got from Poland to Berlin we did\na lot of traveling. So we wound up on the Russian side of Berlin and then we\nescaped to the French side and then finally got to the American side. Once we\nwere on the American side, we re-registered and we found a lot of other Jews\nthere and they told us that there are some camps in Germany, they\u2019re called DP\ncamps where all the Jews after the war should gather, and from there we will see\nwhat to do further, where to go further. So this is where we wound up from\nBerlin we went to Eschfegan (?), Germany, a DP camp where we lived for almost\nfour years.\n29",
        "A: In that camp we got there in the beginning of \u201946, I would say, until \u00b049, when we\ncame to the United States.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, much happier than during the war.",
        "A: Yes, she did grow up. My mother took her to several doctors. She used to get\nsome vitamins and very special things but she did grow up.",
        "A: That was one of the moments. It felt like it was the end. We had no place to go.\nThis was the finality because we didn\u2019t think we were going to see our parents\nagain. Also, when I was separated from my sister with the Doblenkov family, this\nwas petrifying thought for me that I would be a Pole the rest of my life with a\nfamily I don\u2019t even know. I have to live with them and I had to live their style.\nWhatever I remember from before the war or even during the war the love, the\naffection I got from my parents, it\u2019s all gone. I don\u2019t know this was one of the\nmoments. There were so many moments.",
        "A: This was after the war when we were in Poland, when we were in Warsaw, just\nbefore we went to Berlin.\nThe first thing she found out that Jewish children, they want all the Jewish\nchildren in this summer camp, and it was a magnificent place. It seemed like\nthere was a palace over there and everybody lived over there. It was like they\ntook over something and we lived there. There were like a hundred children for a\nvery short time, and we were supposed to be, I suppose they must have advised\nmy mother to bring us there for a few months to retrain our thoughts to make us\naware that the war was over, which I refused to believe. Although I saw signs of\nthe war being over, but I still did not believe, I thought that the Germans would\nspring out from someplace, make a surprise. I didn\u2019t trust anybody anymore. I\ndid not believe anybody anymore. I didn\u2019t want to get close to anybody. They\ntried, they worked on me very, very hard, until I took the cross off, it took awhile\n30\nand I think what influenced me the most was when I met from Israel in the camp,\nthere were some young Israeli, all though there was no Israel at that time, it was\nPalestine, but they came in some kind of uniforms from the kibbutz, maybe, or\nwhatever. They were dressed with the berets and I was so impressed when I\nlooked at them and they said, you see they are just like you, they are also Jews.\nAnd these are young soldiers and this, I think, I fell in love with them the minute I\nsaw them. It was almost like all of a sudden I discovered something, a goal,\nsomething different to leave my past and this is the future to go to Israel and to be\njust like them. And I wanted very much to be just like them and this is where I\nrealized I\u2019m not Polish I\u2019m going to go to Israel and I\u2019m going to find a new\nenemy called Arabs.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No. In those few months they prepared us that we\u2019ll have to start going to school.\nWhen I was in Germany we went to school six days a week and many\nhours a day. From morning until evening we were going to school, and they tried\nto put in those few years all the missing years of schooling that the majority of\nkids were. Everybody was missing five years of school, so you had children from\nall ages. There were also children that were born in concentration camps, there\nwere children that were orphaned, they were taken away from Polish people. I\nmet a lot of people in , also in that camp where we stayed right after the war\nwhen we came to Warsaw after the war when we stayed in this camp. I also met\nsome people from all over and the majority were staying with other families.\nThat\u2019s how they survived and it seems like the families, some kids escaped, some\nof them were older already. Some of them at that time were like 17 or 18 years\nold. They must have run away when the war was over and they came voluntarily\nto this place to find themselves to know who they are. Some, maybe the families,\nthe Polish families, brought them, I don\u2019t know. But they were like dumped.\nBefore you know it within a few weeks more than a hundred children there. So\nthey brought all these psychologists, people talking to us and retraining us, trying\nto make us forget the war in a way and to think that there is another life now is\ngoing to start. There\u2019s a future.",
        "A: When I was in that camp, that summer camp. I found it to be beautiful. Because\nI found people like myself. At first I thought I was the only survivor on this\nplanet. This is a horrible thought that you think you are the only Jews that have\nremained alive and I bet there\u2019s nobody else, so let\u2019s keep it a secret nobody has\nto know what we are. I remember telling this to my mother, don\u2019t tell nobody.\n31",
        "A: Yes. After that camp we went to Berlin.",
        "A: Oh, yes. She always was, she always thought with a clear head and she knew\nexactly and was an extremely brave woman. Such a brave woman that when I\nthink back at things that she did I don\u2019t know where she got authority. I\u2019ve never\ncome across anybody else like that. With such impact, with such go in her, like\nnothing could stop her. Yes, in times of desperation you pick up strength you\nnever knew you had and courage or you die from fear or else you turn the other\nway around and you become extremely courageous. Life is so important that you\nwill do anything to survive.",
        "A: She was something. She was very, very loved, she had so many friends here.",
        "A: Well the originally I did not want to come to America. My goal was to go to\nIsrael.",
        "A: Well that wasn\u2019t with the other kids. I was in Germany at that time. This was\nalready almost four years later and I remember they were always coming from\nIsrael. They were coming to train us. To train us to become young soldiers. How\nto protect yourself, and I was going through all this training and I was ready to\nbecome a soldier.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t make no difference, I was ready to run away from my mother and to go\nthere, and she said \u201cyou\u2019re not going nowhere\u201d. And I remember a few of my\nfriends went on the ship Exodus and I was supposed to be on it and my mother\ncaught me the last minute. She said you are not going. After going through a war\nlike this you\u2019re not going to get shot by an Arab. We are going to America. At\nthat time, of course, I was trained Hebrew, I was taught Hebrew in Germany, it\nwas a language It was supposed to unite us all. I said, but I don\u2019t speak a word of\nEnglish but I do speak Hebrew, so I'll be at home in Israel and all my friends here\nfrom the camp are going and I want to go there too. My mother forbid me, you\nare not to go by yourself, we are all going together. We have relatives in America\nand this is where we are going. And sure enough we came here.\n32",
        "A: No. I go to Israel every opportunity I have. I\u2019ve been there many times, at least a\nthousand.\nand for your story.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome.\n33\n"
