I'm ,\ni's nothing or nothing, | don't have the money to pay you and | squealed. And I'm\nsorry | squealed, so | want you to go away because Jews there, at 8:00 they're\ngoing to come to take you\".

        "Q: Let's go back a little bit. Why, what was going on that made your parents\nconcerned enough to send you away? What were you hearing?",
        "A: | was a very nervous child at the time. And my brother didn't want to leave and\nas my friend said, \"| have an aunt who lives out of town and she will take care and\nwhy don't you let her there?\" So they decided, and I'll never forget, | went by train,\nmy father took me by the, to the train, and in Belgium, in Antwerp, if a German\nwalked in the street and you were Jew, you should walk in the middle of the street,\nnot on the sidewalk where the German. My father must have been excited that he\nleaves me, who knows if he'll see me again, he didn't know, it would be so bad, we\nwalked on the street, a German came, stopped and gave him two beatings on the\nface. And | had a very big respect for my father and | started to cry and shout\nbecause who would slap my father? | never saw it, | never heard of it ,\nThat's it. He had a store first, but he went with me to the station to take the train |\nshould go to the people who were hidden, hiding me.",
        "Q: ;",
        "A: Nothing, you wouldn't dare to say something because my best friend that | tell\nyou, her mother had a store and one day | met, there were German coming into her\nand what kind of friendship she had with him. And he liked me because he had a\nchild the same age as mine and he liked me very much, he wanted only to give me\na kiss or a hug and | didn't want. So, one day | wore my David Star and | went in\nthe street with my mother and | walked across the street, | saw the German. He\ndidn't Know I'm Jewish. So | run in the first store, my mother didn't understand the\nreason. So the second day he came to my friend's mother and he said, \"I could\nhave given any amount of money that | saw that little Anny, but it was a Jewish girl,\ni's not Anny, but she just look like her\". He saw me but he, he couldn't believe it\nwas me because I'm not Jewish, he didn't understand. | didn't know what he would\nhave done if he would know, but he was sure it was me. And it was me. But |\ndisappeared, | was very fast, | disappeared when | saw his face. All that | had in\nmind is go, go. That's what | did.",
        "Q: So you're describing already some new rules. You had to wear a star.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Of David. If you saw a German coming, you had to get out of the street.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were some of the other rules?",
        "A: The rules that children couldn't go in the regular school. Children couldn't go in\nthe library. Couldn't go to any doctor they wanted, only to certain doctors. There\nwas a lot of things you couldn't do, a lot of things.",
        "Q: And how did your parents explain it to you?",
        "A: They sat down and they told us that because we Jewish, they look, not Jews\nlike we, Jews that are the third generation they check. And they explained to us\nand that's it. And | always said | could write a book, lot of stories because | went\nthrough, during the hiding, a lot that | didn't even say my tape. And that's it. And\nnow | don't get a penny from the Germans, | don't get a penny.",
        "Q: explore that, not right now, but when we do the whole\n. SO how soon after the Germans, do you remember hearing that the\nGermans had invaded? Do you remember that moment?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: That was the 10 of May, 1940, they invaded Belgium. And as | told you before,\nthe Belgian Jews didn't know how bad it is, we ran away. And then when we came\nback, they said that the Jews from Belgium, born in Belgium, would not be taken\naway, the Queen announced. And my aunt was born in Belgium and she didn't\nhide or nothing. But my uncle was sitting there and he lived three days, everything\nclosed, they took them away and he was left because he was hiding. Had a child\none and a half and six years old. Then after three days when he came down, they\nwere gone. And he was closed in the apartment, in the house, it was a house.",
        "Q: But, so, the scenario is this, that the Germans invaded, many, many Jews left.\nAfter a few days they came back and they found these new rules. How long did\nyou live like that before your parents decided it was not safe?",
        "A: Two years. Two years. It started and started and people would go away and go\naway, and my parents wouldn't leave my grandfather and that's the reason we\nstayed and that's the reason they were taken away. And my grandfather was taken\naway and then he was 78. My grandmother was taken to a hospital where she\nlived during the war. But my father was a very good son, as you can understand.\nFrom all the five sons, he was the only one who didn't want to leave. That's it.",
        "Q: Did that cause arguments between your mother and your father? Did your\nmother want to leave?",
        "A: | don't think so because she let him decide and she did what he wanted. That's\nit.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk about it with your older brother, you and your brother might be\nsitting together?",
        "A: Maybe not much, he took me much younger than | was and felt he's older, he\nshouldn't tell me, he shouldn't talk about it. But, that's all what | remember, maybe\nyes, but | don't spoke a lot. We didn't talk.",
        "Q: Did your father ever try to explain it to you?",
        "A: No, he explained to me that I'll be a short while by these people, then they'll\ncome and pick me up to be home.",
        "Q: So, let's talk about this. Was there any one thing that made your parents decide\nthat you should go into hiding?",
        "A: Yes, they said that a lot of my friends were taken away. My best friend, she was\na little older, she said, \"Oh, | am so happy to go away, I'll be able to put blue on my\neyes and lipstick\". And she didn't know where and what she's going. And my\nparents said we want you to be somewhere we know where you are. We don't\nwant you to go with her or what. Because | wanted to go with that friend because\nwe were very close, a Jewish girl. She never came back. She never came back.",
        "Q: So a lot of families were beginning to send their children away?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But there wasn't, | mean, one thing? One day this happened and the next day\nyou went into hiding?",
        "A: No, no. No, no.",
        "Q: Tell us about your friend, Raphael, who became, you assumed her identity.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Just tell us, imagine that we don't know anything about it.",
        "A: She was very good, she was an only daughter, she liked me and when | was\nhiding, she went to my aunt, that | told you was Belgian, she went to bring her food.\nShe went to my grandfather, she went to my parents while they were staying in\nBelgium, and she was extremely good. She would put on a Star of David and go in\nthe Jewish neighborhood, she had black hair so she looked Jewish, so everybody\ntook her for a Jew, but she could have been arrested and taken away because she\nwore the David Star and the David Star here. So, but she said in her mind, \"| want\nto help\". She really was helping and doing most she could. Raphael ,\nThere's a little French there. And that's it. So my uncle, when he was taken away,\nlived with nuns in a convent where there was 50, 40 nuns, nobody knew he is a\nman, nobody knew he is Jewish, only the Mother Superior, the Superior Mother.\nThe Mother in charge from the whole nuns there. She knew that he's a man and\nhe's Jewish. But the nuns didn't know and as he had black hair and a beard, he\nshaved four to five times a day, he wore the clothes as a nun.",
        "Q: He was a nun, he pretended to be a woman.",
        "A: Yeah, as a woman and a nun. So four or five times a day he would shave and\neat only kosher.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Israel Livingston.",
        "Q: How did he get into the monastery?",
        "A: The woman who used to work for him, the maid, the housekeeper, she knew\nthat monastery, she talked to them and when he was closed in the house, she went\nthrough the roof and went into the house and put him on clothes from her husband\nwho died. Gave him the identity card of her husband that didn't look at all like him.\nAnd she took him by train to the monastery in Brussels. So she put her life at\nstake, too. And they went to Brussels and the Mother Superior knew about him\nand that's it. And he stayed there a year. A full year in the monastery. Dressed\nand lived like a nun, five times a day he shaved.",
        "Q: And he did this after the Nazis had searched the home and taken his wife and\nchildren away? So he knew he was in danger?",
        "A: No, he didn't Know that same night, that Friday night, they were religious people,\nthey didn't know they coming for him. They thought they coming for them, not for\nhim, they coming for him, not for them. So they said all the time, stay where you\nare, like hysteric. He was upstairs on the third floor. They were downstairs. When\nthey opened the door, they thought somebody squealed on him and they looking\nfor him. Like they looked for me a few times when | was hidden. But it was not\ntrue. They looked for them and not for him, they didn't know he is in the building.\nSo they took away all the family. And when they saw good furniture or good things,\nthey would close from outside to inside the house, nobody should go in. So they\nseal the house til they take out a family. So they sealed it and he was inside.",
        "Q: Let's go back to, do you remember your mother talking to you before, the day\nbefore you went away or the night? What did she say?",
        "A: She would say, \"Look, we have to send you away. It's for your own good, we\nhope to be together soon\". So we thought so. And after the war, we prepared 12\nbedrooms, full bedrooms, and nobody came back. Twenty-eight from the family\nwere taken. Close, you know, father's family, close, aunts and uncles and cousins.\nVery close, 28, were taken away.",
        "Q: What did you take with you when you went into hiding?",
        "A: Maybe three dresses, two dresses, because | used to go to church every\nSunday, they made me go. Because the people in the neighborhood, they\nI'm a niece from out of town. And that dress | would wear Sunday,\nthen nothing, a skirt and a top, maybe. Nothing special. My socks were all hard\nfrom mending, not like now, they mended the socks. | would need the socks, wear\nthem. And they got money for me every month. And once my parents were taken,\nthey were worried. The money will stop. | don't think they would give me up or\nwhat, they wanted to adopt me after the war because they had a sick girl, retarded,\nthey wanted to adopt me and my uncle didn't want me to become Catholic. And\nthey had respect for me, there was never pork in the house while | lived there. But,\nthey were very strict to me, very strict. If | break an egg, | wouldn't get an egg for\nthree days. And the food was not too much. When | had once an accident, they\nwouldn't call a doctor because they were afraid. So, it was not easy when you're\nvery spoiled from home, because | was very spoiled as an only daughter. And\nthat's it.",
        "Q: Did you take anything from home like a doll or photographs?",
        "A: No, only the diary, only the diary, no jewelry. Only the diary, and now I'm more\nin touch than all these years was a cousin of mine that went last week to the\nHolocaust Museum and | got a ticket and she...\n[end of side A of tape one of three]",
        "Q: You were talking about your cousin.",
        "A: And now we got in touch very much and we're very close again. We were very\nclose as children. And she started to call here and | came now and | said, \"! want\nto give you that page from the diary, if | find my diary\". Then | started to looking.\nOne day I'll give it to you, make you a copy. But she painted me a sheep and she\nsay, \"Our love is forever\". It was the last thing | saw her for many, many years,\nmaybe 30, 40 years | didn't see, didn't hear. Now she lives in Houston, Texas. But\nin the war, no, she was in Ecuador, she wasn't in Belgium. She didn't go through\nanything. And when we met a week ago or two, she didn't believe that | don't get\nmoney from the Nazi war because we went through so much, we said, \"Ours was\nour daughters\". And | told them, | don't know if | said it in my tape, | don't think, how\nthey look to me and so on during the war, they were sitting and crying. But | went\nthrough losing my husband that | can't cry. It's not good, it's healthier\nwhen you cry. But | cried a lot after the war and then later | can't. It's inside, you\nsee, some people cry fast, but | can't. | just can't cry so fast.",
        "Q: Who gave you the diary? It was your already?",
        "A: | kept it all the time in the war. And then when | moved from Israel here to get\nmarried, | got married.",
        "Q: No, but | mean, how, when did you start it?",
        "A: | started in Belgium, my parents gave it to me, like diary with a little mirror. And |\nstarted to write, to give it to my friends, and they all signed, most are not there. You\nknow, children. And then, at the end, in the diary, if you see, it's written about my\nparents, my cousin who was taken away and how | feel and how I, and it was very\nsensitive. But then when | made the tea, | say, \"If you want | give you that copy\u201d.\nSo they say, \"No, | want the original\". So | gave the original.",
        "Q: Describe arriving at your new home, where was it and how, what kind of room\ndid you have when you were in hiding? When you were sent away to a family of\nyour best friend?",
        "A: It was a bad feeling. It was a feeling like lost because | always had my parents\nnear me and | was spoiled and loved and cherished. But they tried to be very nice,\nthe man was very, very intelligent and he wanted me only to study, study, gave me\nprivate lesson in German. And then he put me by the nuns to study, studied\nEnglish and French literature. He wanted me only to study. And by the way, last\nweek | wrote a letter to Ellie(ph) Vazel(ph) about somebody and | wrote about me\nand he wanted me only to study and know more because he knew a lot. And they\nhad a retarded child, as | told you and the marriage was not very successful. And |\nwas very naive because when the army came, the English army, we had an\nEnglishman living there, started a little, started with his wife, but | didn't know\nbecause they brought me up, | was at the age 15, 16, like a little girl of seven, eight.\nHe wanted me only to study, only to study. And | must be thankful to him, the\nlanguages, what | know now, is all thanks to him because he insisted | should\nstudy.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Collette and Henri, French names. And the family name was very French,\nGramoulet(ph). Big, , like in Holland and Belgium, ,",
        "Q:",
        "A: Yeah, Gramoulet, big windmill, translate word by word, but that's a name, a\nfamily name.",
        "Q: So did you speak French with them?",
        "A: Yeah, only French.",
        "Q: What did the house look like?",
        "A: Oh, they had a beautiful home. Beautiful garden. But a lot of shooting during\nthe war because it was near a train station and they said to the neighbors that | was\na little sick and | cannot stay in a big city, so they, it was around 50 miles from\nBrussels. They, | cannot stay in the city with my parents, | have to have fresh air of\nthe suburbs, that's the reason they took me. And they want me to stay with them.\nBut | had a lot of, lot of accidents. That being the first and the worst accident was\nthat | went to a man who gave me an identity card. You need cards for food and\nidentity. And | saw that big truck with people from the German and | couldn't hide\nand | couldn't run away. But inside the truck was a boy who knew me from\nBelgium, from Antwerp. And his parents wanted him to stay, they\ndidn't know him and they didn't want, so he said to somebody in the wagon that |\nam Jewish, not Catholic. So they looked at me, but | had disappeared. | wasn't\nthere, so the German looked for me after that in every house they came, there was\nmaybe in the street, five like houses, villas they called it. And they looked but they\ncouldn't find me because it took five minutes to stretch between the tennis, you and\n| play tennis, there is the, you know, what's in between us, the net, that's between\nus, goes like that, so when you turn it that was like steps and | took it up on the\nattic, | took it up.",
        "Q: Wait. You crawled up a net?",
        "A: No, the net, we used to take the net and put it here and that is the attic, | would\ngo up.",
        "Q: You would make sort of a stairs.",
        "A: Yeah. | would go up the kind of stairs, take up the net, close the door and that\nwas the attic, you could not put a ladder, you could not put a chair and go up, you\ncouldn't reach, only with that net.",
        "Q: You sort of climbed up a rope net?",
        "A: You did it. And closed the door. | was small, but stayed there three hours.\nWhen | came back, | was half fainted because it was a chimney, like a chimney,\nyou know, for the coal and so | was half fainted when they took me out from there.\nThey looked three-quarter of an hour in the house.",
        "Q: And what did that sound like when they were looking for you?",
        "A: At the same moment it was like, just I'm going to faint, that | felt like I'm going\nany minute to faint because it was hot from the coal and it was hot from that going\nup in a rush. It's not that you take it easy, you go slowly, | had to make it in two\nminutes, go up, take the net, close the door from inside, it was all, and don't forget, |\nwas very childish. It's not that you're grown up and you know what you do, why,\nwhat, when. But at the same moment you do it because you feel you want to live.\nYou want to stay alive. And the second day...",
        "Q: Let's stay with this just for a second, though. So are you standing up...",
        "A: No, laying, laying.",
        "Q: Laying down. And what can you hear?",
        "A: | can hear not good because the door is closed, but | can hear a little. A little.\nLike screaming saying, \"To hell with it, where is she? Isn't she here?\" \"No\". But |\nhave a feeling she's here. \"Is she here?\" \"No\". And it would go on and go on for\nhalf an hour. And you would stand just here and | am just on top of you. So any\nminute | thought you'll find out, but you had no way. If you're smaller, you had no\nway to come up, because it was too narrow and too small and you couldn't come\nup. And then the second day from that, they didn't give up on me. They say they\nknow that they have a Jewess at . So it went so fast.",
        "Q: So the Germans said that they were sure...",
        "A: Sure there was some hiding a Jew. So they came unexpected, |\ndidn't have the time to go up, so they put me in the garden and then like buried me.\nThey put earth on me and | was there. The same time, the next day.",
        "Q: Oh, the next day. Who took you in the garden?",
        "A: My aunt, my aunt. They digged a hole, they put me in, they covered the hole\nand they were looking in the garden, but there was no sign, there was nothing, you\nunderstand? Because there was no sign that there was somebody, there was\nplants and there was potatoes or something.",
        "Q: Did you resist being buried?",
        "A: | don't Know, | remember that | was sick for two days after that, | was staying in\nbed and | was crying all the time. Because | didn't know why they did it to me. She\nsay, \"It's for your own good\". She was very, very nice, very stingy, | remember, but\nvery nice. Very warm person, but stingy, very stingy. That was all in one week.\nThe attic, , and the third day, it was not finished. | was supposed to go\nto the man who gave me the identity card. And it was not like from here to the\ncorner, it was not far and he had to change something on my identity card, it was in\nRaphael's name. So he, he saw | am young and he take advantage, he say, \"I\ninsist, you should tell me that's your real name\". It's not my real name. | say, \"It's\nmy real name\". | wasn't so stupid. And he insisted, | wouldn't tell. So\nthen he say, you know, \"Leave me your identity card here. Next Monday, I'll give it\nto you\". And | had a feeling, sixth sense, not to give him, | say, \"I'll give it to you\nSunday\". | came home and | cried, | say, \"He wanted that card\". She says, \"You\ndidn't give it to him?\" | say, \"No, | had a feeling not to\". She say, \"My child, do\nwhatever you feel\". The next morning she came to me and she hugged me, she\nsay, \"You know, they killed him\". He was on his way somewhere and he had\nidentity cards, 25 or 30, and all these people were taken away. You didn't know if\nhe worked for the Germans and for the American, for both.",
        "Q: double?",
        "A: Double. So they never knew who killed him. But the people were all taken\naway. She was very, very happy that | didn't give him the card because there was\nthe address and the name and the age, everything on the identity card. So she\nwas very happy.",
        "Q: | want to go back to, | mean, how little were you? How quickly could you dig a\nhole for you?",
        "A: | didn't dig it. They digged it maybe two or three days in advance in case they\nneeded it. They prepared. | didn't dig it. Not | knew, not | would. No, | didn't dig\nthat hole.",
        "Q: Did you close your eyes? Did they put a blanket over you?",
        "A: Nothing, nothing. Just plain, yeah. Just alive.",
        "Q: And how long were you underground?",
        "A: Maybe half an hour she told me. But it was like a year. But it was only a half a\nyear, a half an hour, that's all. No, and | could never have a doctor like one time |\nmade soap and | burned all my hands, here | have signs and they would not call a\ndoctor. All that boiling water and soap, we didn't have soap, so we made soap\nourselves, they couldn't call the doctor because they were afraid. The only thing is,\n| went Sunday to church and that's all. For now. She used to say, \"You pray for\nyour God. | know you don't pray, but you pray for your God\". | say, \"Not supposed\nto pray for your God in a church\". | said, \"You have to go to a synagogue, you\ncannot pray in a church\". She say, \"You can\".",
        "Q: Do you think that's true?",
        "A: | don't think you can pray in a church for a synagogue, | don't think so.",
        "Q: Who, when you Say like after you were buried alive, that you cried for two days,\nwho comforted you? Or did anyone touch you or ,",
        "A: They comforted me, but not like a mother. Not like a mother. | don't know how\nyou feel with your mother, but it was missing because it was not the comfort of a\nmother. But they tried to calm me down, make me calm. Bult, it was not too strong,\nthe comfort. Maybe at that time, at that moment, going through what | went\nthrough, | was a little hard and | overcome this. You understand? But, you know.\nThat's what | did.",
        "Q: When you were in the hole, with the dirt on top of you, could you hear the\nGermans looking for you?",
        "A: No, but | felt like, go, a certain moment, it was like they go on top of me, but\notherwise, | don't know where they are. But when they walk near me, it felt like you\nwalk on my head. But that's all, but | didn't react. Maybe | was too weak or maybe\n| was mixed up or maybe | was anxious and nervous from what's happening. They\nwould say in advance, | would say, \"! don't accept, | won't do it\". And then | did it\nbecause they wanted me to do it.",
        "Q: They had warned you that that might happen, and you said, \"| don't want to be\nburied?\"",
        "A: No, they say, we might have to do that. | say, \"| would prefer to go up in the\nattic\". She said to wait and see what situation will be. Then the situation didn't\ncome to go to the attic and they had no other way than to do that. Because if they\ndon't save me, they would be taken away to one because all the of the\nfamily, we gave somebody, and the son squealed on the father, they took away his\nfather and all the silver of the family. So | told her to , | read it in the\npaper what, so she said, \"You see, God forbid if they take you, they take us away,\ntoo because we wanted to save you. So we also in danger as much as you are\".\nShe explained to me, she says, \"So, you have to do what we tell you to do because\nwe just in danger like you are\". So | decided to do what she tells me.",
        "Q: What did you call her?",
        "A: Aunt.",
        "Q: What was a regular day like? Did you think every day, maybe the Germans will\ncome looking for me? Maybe just describe a regular day.",
        "A: | got up in the morning and | was, | was in a very bad mood because | didn't\nknow what the day is going to bring and they had a, like a maid who would take\ncare of the daughter and they would let me help her. And they would teach me\nhow to take the dust, not like that, like that. How to clean house. All that what my\nmother never asked from me. She said, \"One day you'll be on your own. If you're\nrich, you'll have a maid. If you don't know what to do with yourself, you won't be\nable to tell her how to do it. So | want you to know, | want you to do it. And then\nyou can give orders to somebody else. But first, you have to teach yourself to do it.\nYou have to decide your own, because you never know, maybe you have no\nparents one day\". She knew that it might happen. She wanted to prepare me\nmentally, as well as her husband who, | told you, was very intelligent and was very\nrealistic and he thought it might happen that she will be alone left, so let's prepare\nher. But, | didn't want to think about it. Sometimes you know it's going to happen,\nbut you don't want, you don't want to think it's going to happen, you don't want to\naccept it. But that's it.",
        "Q: How long did you live in hiding with these people?",
        "A: | lived two years. They wanted, also, after the war, not to give me back, they\nwanted to adopt me when my uncle came and stayed. But the aunt was not\npleasant because she left her husband and went away with the Englishman and for\na long time the husband thought that | had something to do, that | helped her out.\nAnd | didn't know, | was very naive. They used to go everything, Monday, to\nBrussels, and they took me along, we went to movie, we went shopping, after the\nwar, the wife of my uncle, my aunt. And then one day | became sick, they went by\nthemselves, they never took me again. They liked to be by themself. | didn't know\nwhy, they had an affair, | didn't know what's an affair. | didn't know what's an affair.\nSo he was a little angry at the end, he say, \"I give so much of myself to that girl and\nshe didn't be thankful to me\". So my uncle said, \"She was naive, it's not that she\nwas mean or what. She didn't understand\".",
        "Q: Your uncle thought that somehow you had a role in his wife?",
        "A: The uncle, the non-Jew. Yes.",
        "Q: The pretend uncle.",
        "A: The pretend uncle thought | have a role by helping them to get together while |\ndidn't understand and | didn't want to say that on the tape, I'll tell you later, | didn't\nunderstand. That I'm helping or not, | didn't grasp, | wasn't like that.",
        "Q: Were you able to hear anything about your parents during, when you first\nmoved in with these people who hid you? Did you keep in touch at all?",
        "A: A week or two, that's all. A week or two. Two weeks, that's all, not more.",
        "Q: So how did they keep in touch?",
        "A: The people who lived next door to us would call him at work, my uncle, my\npretend uncle, but then they stopped calling. And when they were taken away, and\nthe money finished, every three months they paid for me, they paid money, they\nshould keep me. So she used to say to me, \"How will we get the money?\"\nBecause they also took me a lot because of the money they needed, naturally. So\nthe man, the owner from the apartment, non-Jew, used to send the money every\nthree months like before. His own money.",
        "Q: A friend of your father?",
        "A: No, the owner of the apartment where we lived, my parents, he sent his own\nmoney because he said later, he was afraid maybe I'll give me up or what and he\nsend the money every three months. And we in touch with his son, he's dead. His\nson is in touch and he would say the nicest thing in every letter for Christmas and\nNew Year that he writes me, \"My father didn't save you to go to a country where\nthere is war all the time. My father didn't save you\". Every year he writes me the\nsame sentence. A nice man, he's around my age and he's nice. We used to play\nwhen we were young and he's very nice, he writes me very nice letters. And such\nkind of people | like get in touch and like to be in touch.",

        "A: Half a year, four months. Four months.",
        "Q: How did you hear about that? Who told you?",
        "A: A long time after that they told me. They didn't tell me that when it was fresh,\nmonths after that, they didn't want me to know, they didn't know what reaction | will\nhave and they didn't know. They didn't tell me that when it was fresh.",
        "Q: When they did tell you the story, who told you?",
        "A: My aunt, my aunt. It was Raphael, yeah, Raphael told her a few days after\nbecause she didn't live far away, but she told me. She first prepared me a little and\nshe say, you know, \"They're deporting a lot of Jews from Antwerp\", and they would\nnever had been deported so fast if not that woman because in the street where we\nlived, was two Jews, a man and a family and we, like | told you, it was not a Jewish\nneighborhood. But if not that woman, maybe they will stay til after the war or\nmaybe a few months, but it was not a Jewish neighborhood and all the people\nknew each other and they would never squeal like she did. She really squealed on\nthem.",
        "Q: How do you know what happened, how did you get the details?",
        "A: Somebody after the war told my uncle that they were taken to Auschwitz and\nthat's it. That's it.",
        "Q: But the story that you tell, for instance, about your brother hiding, how did you...",
        "A: There was that woman on the third floor, was like, how do you say, easy, easy\ngoing, and after the war went to her office and suddenly | feel a woman giving me a\nslap on the face and shouting and and everybody turns around. She\ndidn't know that I'm alive and that | was hidden and she, when the German came,\nwanted to take, like | told you, my brother, hid him under her bed, didn't want. So\nshe knew and she saw when they were taken away, she told me everything then.",
        "Q: She hit you?",
        "A: She got so excited, nervous, she didn't know that | was alive and at the same\nmoment, she remembered that she wanted to save my brother and he didn't want\nto stay with her, so she was so, | don't know how to say in English, she was very,\nshe was out of herself seeing me in there, it was not that she hit me from anger or\nwhat, she was so, she couldn't believe that it's me in the stair. If |, it would be 20,\n30 years you can change, but that was three, four years, so | didn't change so\nmuch in the four years, that she didn't recognize me. And | was with my uncle, my\nuncle didn't understand, too, and then she excused herself, we went to drink a cup\nof coffee and she explained. And she told us that and then at night, the same night,\n| was very hysterical. And what my uncle did to calm me down, but | was very, |\nknew they not coming back, but the way she told us in there, it was reopen the\nwound they call it. It was like reopening a wound. That's it.",
        "Q: But also maybe helping to close it, possibly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were getting some information that you didn't necessarily have.",
        "A: It was bad information and you wanted to know, so it's both together, you\nunderstand? It was information, good and not good. It can be sad, if it's good or\nnot good.",
        "Q: When were you told that your parents were deported? How old were you, do\nyou remember?",
        "A: Around 16, 16.",
        "Q: After about a year or two?",
        "A: Yeah. No, when | was, a month or two after they were deported. When | heard\nthey wouldn't come back, we used to have 13 bedrooms and then every two days\nmy uncle would sell another bedroom because he saw there is nothing, nobody\ncoming back. And we had saved a few apartments from the family, we had a big\nhouse with a lot of bedrooms. So every night | would come back, there would be\nanother bedroom for me. See and it was very demoralizing, very. And then my\nuncle took his package and went to South America. And | stayed in Belgium.",
        "Q: Who told you that they had been deported? | mean, where were you?",
        "A: | was with my uncle and it was...",
        "Q: Pretend uncle?",
        "A: No, no. It was my real uncle, after the war and they, | don't remember, it was\nsome friends of my uncle that they heard from somebody else that was in the camp\nwith my parents. And they saved themself. There was a few, very few, people that\ncame back from Auschwitz, not many. Maybe if my brother wouldn't have gone in\nthe line for my father, because they took younger people separate, he would have\nlived, but he wanted only to be with my father, he was very close to my father. And\nhe was young, they would have kept him, they would put him to work or, but he\ndidn't want.",
        "Q: He was like your father who stayed with his father.",
        "A: Yeah. Maybe.",
        "Q: | just want to get this clear, though. When were you, you weren't told right away\nthat they were deported, who told you that and were you still, you must have still\nbeen in hiding? That they had left your home.",
        "A: Oh, that was months after, two months after | was hiding. My pretend aunt.\nYeah. The man, who later on paid for me, must have called or written to her about\nthat. And if | didn't get any mail, | never looked at the mail, understand.",
        "Q: What did it mean, did you know then that they had been sent to Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, no, no. | knew they were deported, but at that time we didn't know what and\nwhen or Auschwitz, no, we didn't know. Didn't know. Some of the people who\nwent to Auschwitz, | read a lot about it, didn't Know. They didn't know. But, like\nagain, | tell you, if they would have, if they would take me, they would take my\npretend aunt and uncle because there were a lot of people that happened to them.\nAnd some Jews squealed on other Jews, like that boy who wanted to squeal on\nme. He said, \"Why should | go, why shouldn't she come?\" | don't know what an\ninterest, | wouldn't do it because why should | take you? It's enough I, but people\nare selfish so they want you to be in the same situation...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",

        "A: | think she was there once, that's all. Yeah. Because they tried not to have\npeople over, they say they brought over their niece, me, and they didn't want.\nBecause she was also a child, she can say something that she shouldn't or what.\nNeighbors and it was not, not recommended. Probably that's what the aunt said, |\nwill have to ask when | see her, God will, how many times or if she came. But |\ndon't think more than once, if | remember well, but I'll have to ask her.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel sometimes, you're a young girl, did they actually call you\nRaphael? Did they say, Raphael, when they called you?",
        "A: No, when there was no one strange, they wouldn't call me, my name is Anny,\nthey wouldn't call me Anny, they would call me a short cute name, Annime(ph),\nthat's my Anny, but if you would be there or a stranger, they would call me,\nJeanine(ph). She changed my name from Raphael, Jeanine to Raphael. My\nname, at home and at school was Jeanine, it was a French name. And then she\nchanged it when she went to France and she wants only to be called Raphael.\nMust be that her real name now is officially Raphael, because when | send her a\ncheck | write Raphael, too. So it must be.",

        "Q: Anny Rubenstock.",
        "A: No, never talked. No, you see, that man wanted to know, | never told, because\nshe told me, \"Never tell anyone. You are Jeanine , and that's it.\nNobody ever has to know that\". She never, she didn't let me and | didn't do it. And\n| went to the nuns for the English lesson or what, sometimes they would say,\n\"Jeanine\". | would look, | wouldn't Know, you know? It reminds me they wanted to\ntake me in Israel to the and spy. After the war when | came to Israel\nbecause | know language and | went through so much. So one of my friends spoke\nto somebody about spies, so that man came and he asked me, would | be\ninterested to be in a, would | be interested to be in another country and work for\nIsrael? | say, \"Yes\". They went through with all the, now | don't like to go to a\ndoctor, | went to doctors for months, | went to psychiatrists, | went to everything.\nBut when did | fall through? When they say if | knew to hold a gun, | say, \"No\". |\nsay . But they would go and find out who are my friends, what's my\nfamily, they went in the background. But then when the called the hospital, they\ncalled my name, | don't remember what it was, | jumped up, | forgot it's my,\nbecause | didn't go to my name. They didn't want me to know. It reminds me when\nthey said, \"Jeanine\" in school, | looked like, it's not me. And the teacher says,\n\"Jeanine\". And oh yeah, it's me.",

        "A: | think she waited about a week or what, something, to tell them. And to tell\nthem this whole story and my parents were taken away and we don't know what\nhappened, what will happen with me because we didn't hear yet from my uncle that\nhe was alive and she said to the nuns, \"I'll be coming\", because she wants to adopt\nme. You understand that that's a decision that she and her husband made, but\nnothing came out.",

Everybody had another wish, to see their beloved or what, but |, | just\nthought about that, that soon, to me | will go to my parents, that they\nwill be better than her. You understand?

        "A: Nobody.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They had taken out a lot, the German furniture, good things, antiquities, but\notherwise they left the house and it was not , but it was a terrible\nfeeling to go in the house because | remember like now, there was a long hall and\nthere was a little shoe of the little girl they took away, a year and a half, it was on\nthe floor, that she lost. So, a million and a half children they killed,\nwhat do you want. A million and a half. That's a lot.\nQ; So you went in the house with him and there were some of these items from, it\nwas like going into a time capsule?",
        "A: It was terrible.

And\nthat pot was on the, you know, it's like you leave now all dead and | come back and\nsee four empty glasses while nobody lived here. Who were the four people? Who\ndrank from that. So it's a very, very unpleasant feeling.

So it hurt me. Because | say, even if | wouldn't need the money I'll give it to\nRaphael, but it should come to me more than to you that you had your family, you\nstayed all over the war with your family. That's a big plus. Right?",
        "Q: Do you, what was it like when you first saw your uncle?",

And | came to my uncle and | say, \"I\nwant to see you, but | want to see my parents\". The he took me to see my\ngrandmother who spent all the war in the hospital, | told you and came out. She\nwas the first funeral, Jewish funeral in Antwerp when she died. But before she died\nand | used to come to her, she was a little mixed up, but still she would say, \"Why\ndoesn't your father come to see his mother, why do you come to see me?\"\nUnderstand? She didn't grasp the situation. | didn't know then. But she was the\nfirst funeral, my uncle was very upset. So, he said, \"If you don't stop crying, I'll put\nyou in with your grandmother because you have to stop crying\". But some people\ncan cry when they're told enough. It's a thing that's inside. Or you cry or you don't\ncry, right?",
        "Q: It sounds like you did cry.",
        "A: Oh, a lot.",
        "Q: You cried.",

        "Q: So what did your uncle say? | mean, obviously, what did you uncle say about\nyour parents? And then what might happen?",
        "A: He didn't know at the time. He didn't know. He only said, \"Let's hope they come\nback\". At that time, there was still a lot of hope. You understand? Everybody\nhoped it will go okay.",
        "Q: So you didn't go, did you ever go to your family apartment? You were in your\nuncle's house, but did you ever go to the apartment where you lived with your\nfamily?",

What a gift.\nAnd my uncle paid them back for all these years that they paid, you know, they\nwere very nice. | went to say hello to them. But it was a half a year after | stayed\nwith my uncle. And all my friends started to go out, have a good time and | never\nhad a good time. Because | worked. My uncle opened a store in Belgium and |\nused to sell the American, the English, [phone ringing, pause in tape].",
        "Q: So it was just your uncle and you?",
        "A: Yeah. No, it was, after that, came a nephew from his wife, from Treblinka. And\nhe was Polish and didn't know Belgium, but he heard somebody is\nand he stayed with us. And my uncle when to South America, he wanted\neverything, everything. He came back from Treblinka where he saved himself.\nAnd that's it. He came like from nowhere.",
        "Q: Did he talk about what it was like in Treblinka?",
        "A: | don't remember because he used to talk very badly Jewish, a lot of lot of Polish\nand | didn't know a word of Polish. But he spoke very little. When he came, he\nweigh maybe, he was maybe like that. So later he gained weight and he became\nmore person. But when he came he was very depressed and my uncle helped him\na lot.

Before that, people\ndidn't know, we didn't know what happened. Then we were, started to understand\nand to know.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts when you first heard this story?",
        "A: My thought was that it happened, but not maybe to them. At that point, and\nvery selfish, but | thought, no, it didn't happen to them. It happened,\nbut not to them. See, you don't realize that it can happen to your own, too. You\nthink it's only to, that's all.",

        "Q: And did he tell the story of how...",
        "A: My uncle never told me. Maybe he didn't want to hurt me or maybe he didn't\nwant me to know or anyway, in short, he never told me specifically what, when and\nhow. He didn't. | think he didn't want it.",
        "Q: You think he knew?",

So | went. But | went to this neighbor, who wanted to save my\nbrother, and she accepted me really, the one who wanted to slap my face. She\nwas very nice. She didn't slap my face because she was mean or what, it was a\nkind of excitement and surprise to see me. You know? If you think that person is\nno more and suddenly you find out the person is there, it's a very big, it was\nsomething she'll never forget as long as she lives. She was an old woman then,\nshe must be dead, but she was very, and then it's her nature, she was very\nexcitable in general, | remember as a child, so when she saw me and that uncle of\nmine, she, she got so hysterical, I'll never forget as long as | live how hysterical.\nFrom happiness.",

She'd come to my uncle every day in the morning and stay\ntil at night because she was so happy to see me and be with me and that. And she\nloved Israel. We went to the Hilton in Jerusalem and my husband wanted to stay\novernight. She wants to go to a kibbutz. She doesn't want to stay. Very simple,\nbut very nice, very nice. And she happened to be a very intelligent girl that her life\nchanged now, but she was over-excited so in 1960 my aunt went to\nNice in France and she took care of her house, because with a lake and a\nswimming pool and everything in Nice. And | lived in Israel and she wanted me to\ncome.

Anny pays for you\".\n\"No, no, no. | want to get her a gift\". He says, \"She doesn't need it\". So we gave\nher cash when she left, a few hundred dollars, she wouldn't take, she says she\nwants a check. She's so primitive, a check she won't lose, the money she'll lose,\nmaybe you want to buy something. She's very, but she's not demanding, oh, she's\nso nice. She's very artistic.

He told him, she was innocent,\nshe was very naive and so on. And he wouldn't accept it, wouldn't accept it\nbecause he was a very, very cultivated, serious man, while that Englishman was\nvery primitive. And that's the end. And it's a pity he didn't believe my uncle or me\nthat | had nothing to do with that. And that's it.

But now, everything is beautiful now and it's good.\nAnd people say, \"You're not afraid?\" And I'll tell you on that answer, you never\nknow where to be afraid because | had a very good friend, by the way, who lived in\nIsrael and her son finished college here. And he came back to Israel and they\ndidn't want him to go to the army because maybe he'll be killed or what, God forbid.\nSo they moved to New York and in a few, many years ago, there was something\nnear the, near the, some people went in in the lunch room and they killed some\npeople. And if you will remember a few years ago, and he was one of them. His\nwife was pregnant eight months. So he was killed. Maybe he would have made\nthe army and not be killed. So you cannot be afraid because it won't help you. And\nyou can't live in a country, every minute you be afraid or you'll get crazy.",
        "Q: Were you afraid a lot when you were in hiding?",
        "A: | was all the time tense, as young as | was. And maybe for that I'm still a little\nnervous, but | don't show it. Because now my sister-in-law is not so well, but why\nshould | shout or be angry on her or what, I'm not that type. | was not brought up\nlike that. But inside maybe I'm nervous because | went through a lot and it hurt me\na lot when | didn't get more, or how much did | get? Four or five thousand dollars,\nthat's all from the German. While all these friends that | know, are getting monthly\ngood incomes. One of my friends went and she said that she's not, her mind is not\ngood. She's a year younger than |. So they made her a, an exam. She said stupid\nthings, she's very smart. And now she gets eight or nine hundred dollars a month\non Germany because she's incapable. That's what they say. She's much more\ncapable than | will ever be, but she succeeded by lying and I'm not the type who will\nlie. I'm not going to lie for money. I'm not going to lie for money. But | went\nthrough, like you heard, a lot. And people who went much less through, that |\nknow, and they are alone, they say, you should get more than I, or you should get,\nbut, you should get. You understand?",
        "Q: Tell us, when you applied for that.\nA; | applied and | got, oh, three thousand or four thousand dollar.",
        "Q: .",
        "A: In 1952, 53, and then they gave me the three thousand dollars, | shouldn't have\ntaken it, but nothing to do. And then they refuse and they, now | know the reason.\nMy uncle went through a lot, he lost a wife and two children, but | had a lawyer in\nBelgium, he was no good. That's the mistake. If you would go, it was then, you\nknow, agencies took care of all that, and they would help you and do it. | didn't go, |\nwent to a lawyer who took a lot of money in advance, who didn't go anything.\nMaybe he got six thousand, he gave me three thousand or four thousand. But all\nthese friends of mine, | don't Know if they got a sum, but they got, they get every\nmonth now. And they really don't believe, | wouldn't lie, if | would get, | would say,\nwhy, why the lying? Some people like to lie, | don't like to lie. If | don't get, | don't\nget. I'm not going to say | don't get when | get. Or | get when | don't get.",
        "Q: Could you appeal it, then?",
        "A: | think it's too late. | think it's too late.",
        "Q: Have you ever been to Germany?",
        "A: I've never gone. You? No, | would never go. No interest.",
        "Q: What about going to a place like Auschwitz.",
        "A: I'll tell you the true, | don't, | went through now a lot, too, last year with my\nhusband being very sick and all the family wanted me to put him away\nand | didn't, | took care. So maybe another year or what, you know, will be more\nrelaxed, maybe I'll do it. Because my cousin wanted very bad to go, the one from\nIsrael, to the place where | was born and where our grandmother was living, but |\nwasn't ready to go with her because he was sick. Now maybe, I'll take a rest a\nyear, if I'm capable to concentrate and relax, maybe | would do it. But not now for\nthe moment.",
        "Q: When did your husband die?",
        "A: January, so it's still fresh.",
        "Q: Oh, yes.",
        "A: It's still very fresh.",
        "Q: ,",
        "A: Yeah. Still fresh, so, | was all by myself and it's not easy. So, that's what it is.",
        "Q: How old was he?",
        "A: Was not young, was 78, but , very intelligent man, but very sick. So,\nhe just suffered the last two months, few months. So nothing could be done, so it's\na pity.",
        "Q: Did you, did you purposely not have children or was that a decision you made\ntogether?",
        "A: No. It didn't come out, I'll tell you why | think. Because when we married, his\nmother became old, she stayed with her daughters, we used to go there all the time\nand all the time and years went by and you know, sometimes years go so fast that\nyou don't know. You turn around and you're middle aged, you're old, no? It's like\nthat.",
        "Q: So you've always been with people who are always very, taking care of their\nfamilies?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: your father.",
        "A: Yeah, and then also, then also | used to be very friendly with somebody, she\nhad four children and | was there and | took care most of the time of the children\nand now | don't know if they'll recognize me. That's it. Some stay friends with you,\nbut some, ignore you, let's put it this way.",
        "Q: What was it like when you got, to go back a little bit now, to Israel, this idea that\nyou had to hide being Jewish and you could, for so long, and they got, created\nterrible danger for people you loved, to be in a country where you could be\ncompletely open and proud of being Jewish. What was that like for you?",
        "A: When? When | came to Israel?",
        "Q: When you first went to Israel and you could, you could be really relaxed.",
        "A: Yeah, | enjoyed it. | enjoyed it. But | had a hard time because used to live in\nthe suburbs and go, and go to Tel Aviv and stay from eight in the morning in that\nheat til seven at night. Not be able to refresh or what. And from one to four, the\nstores would be closed, so | just walked around, | didn't have what to do. So it was\nvery hard, you understand? So | couldn't enjoy life enough because | had a hard\ntime. And | wasn't so close to my family there because | didn't know them so long\nas my other family that | grew up with them. So it was very hard. But | came over\nthat, too.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about life in Uruguay, which is where your uncle lived. Who\nwas there and what was ,",
        "A: He had two brothers, he had two brothers and they had families. And then he\ngot married, he had his own family. And when the children became bigger, he was\nafraid they'll marry, intermarriage, so he moved everything to Israel. They should\nget married with Jewish girls, that's what they did. Because, you know, so much\nintermarriage, | don't have to tell you, no? So, and he's very religious, so, very\nreligious. So. Lived a Jewish life and always very nice. The women have it very\neasy, a maid costs you thirty or forty dollars a year, a month, so you can afford two\nmaids. And life is easy, but it's still not like in Israel, it's still, it's still different. Like\nhere, it's very nice, but here without a car, without, it's very hard, | don't have to tell\nyou. Where do you live?",
        "Q: Downtown Washington D.C.",
        "A: So it's not easy.",
        "Q: When were you ever able to say to yourself finally, my brother and my mother\nand father aren't coming back?",
        "A: That was a few good months after the war. A few good months after the war.\nWhen | saw the reality that the people who came, came already, and other ones\nwon't come. And they began to talk and to show and then we saw that you have to\naccept the truth. And the reality. It was not easy in the beginning because you\nused to see, to go, then they didn't go like now to Auschwitz to look and that.\nPeople didn't go like now to go, but we all the time asked, asked, we heard that\nsomebody came back and we went and maybe he was seeing them and that, that\nmust be the way my uncle found that man who saw my parents. That he found out\nthat that man was in Auschwitz and saved himself and maybe it was the same time,\nand he learned that it was the same time.",
        "Q: What did these people look like to you, | mean they were presumably coming\nback very thin.",
        "A: Very thin, very nervous, very depressed. But, they began to live and they, that's\nit. But in the beginning they were very skinny and very down, mentally and\nphysically, both. That's it.",
        "Q: | know that at that time they had newsreels of the camps and some\nphotographs.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember ever seeing that?",
        "A: No. | never saw that . They were all so like the museum, they\nhave a place in Brussels now, | would like to go and see that, if God willed, if | had\nthe occasion, they have a very, very big place, so much taller than me, and it's\nwritten all the Jews from Antwerp and Brussels who killed where, at Auschwitz or\nBergen-Belsen or, where they were killed. What date exactly and what time, what,\nand | wanted very badly to go. Somebody told me who saw it and my parents were\nin that list. Somebody told me they didn't see the list. So | wanted to go by myself\nonce. | want to see, one day I'll go.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you first saw photographs of Auschwitz?",
        "A: It wears very much on me, very, made me very depressed. | started to take an\nanti-depressant and it didn't help me because | was depressed mentally very much.\nAnd then | see it won't help you, being depressed. Talked to myself. But it didn't\nhelp, it didn't help the pills, not talking, it was depressing because some people can\nsee movies and so on and read, they don't mind. But it's, it's a character. Because\n| say | would never over live it, and some people say | don't know how | over lived it\nand they came out.",
        "Q: When was it? When was it that you first saw pictures?",
        "A: All the pictures | saw '47 and before, and '46, '47. So, that's what it was.",
        "Q: Did you ever, with your uncle, do any sort of service of sit shiva? | mean...",
        "A: No, | keep a date that the rabbi gave me, a rabbi in Israel gave me a date and |\nkeep that day, give a, | give a donation to Schul(ph) that day and we say\nkaddish(ph) and that's all.",
        "Q: So you did mark a day?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And if you went to that museum, you might find out an actual day.",
        "A: That's it, then | might find exactly the day, maybe or approximative. And | would\nlike to go there, but no chance for the last few years because of my husband's\nillness, but one day I'll go. It doesn't do me too good, in '65 | was in Belgium and |\nwent through, went from the house where we lived to where the school was and\nthat. The street didn't change, only the stores and the people change. And it did\nme very bad. Stayed three days and | run away. Three days or two days, it was\ntoo much. And | think it was too much because | was alone. | was not with a friend\nor, | wouldn't do that by myself any more. | would only go with somebody or that |\ncare for or, just somebody, not to go by myself, | wouldn't do it. Also you know, the\nnights to stay there in a hotel alone and remember the streets and that. No, no. |\nwouldn't go back by myself, never.",
        "Q: You uncle's still alive, | mean, do you ever think about pressing him for details?",
        "A: He had a stroke three years ago and his mind is good and that, | don't think he\nfeels like talking about it. | don't think so.",
        "Q: Do you think he'd ever do an oral history interview?",
        "A: Doubt it, | doubt it. He's saw my tape when | showed it in Israel and it made him\nvery, don't know, he didn't feel depressed really, feel dead because in my tape | say\nmy uncle went to Uruguay and left me alone. So it was not a good feeling for\npeople who heard and it was said in the room. You understand? And | couldn't, |\ncouldn't change the tape, the tape was there, the truth was there.",
        "Q: Did you feel like that?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: That he left you alone?",
        "A: Yeah, | felt lost a little because | was young and all my friends had parents and |\nwas no parents, nobody, like left alone. So it hit me a little, you know. Not much,\nbut a little.",
        "Q: How long did you stay alone?",
        "A: In Belgium, maybe eight, nine, ten months. It was too long. It's the way you\nfeel.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "Q: This is an interview with Anny Kast, K-A-S-T. Conducted by Katie Davis on\nAugust 5 in Silver Spring, Maryland. This is tape number three, side A. I'm curious\nabout how you think your experience hiding and your losses, 28 people, how that\naffected your approach to life? Maybe your philosophy or your interactions with\npeople?",
        "A: The feeling, to tell you the true, | had is that people are alone, like me now,\nshould take care of themself, but I'm the person that | like to give and not wait to\nreceive. | like to give from myself, to be good to people, to help people. If it's\nmentally or physically or materially, | like to give, I'm not demanding and I'm not the\nsnob that says | have or don't have. I'm not the type to complain. | had many years\nthat | didn't have and | never complained. And people never knew if | have or not\nbecause | made an impression | have a lot and | liked it because | don't want pity. |\nhad enough pity during my first years, | don't want pity. That means even if | didn't\nhave, whenever somebody came, | had cake and coffee and fruit and everything.\nThe people came shouldn't know the way | feel. | didn't want them to know. And\nI'm now like that, too. Even people in Israel, especially, are very curious. They ask\nyou such private questions that | can't accept.",
        "Q: About?",
        "A: | don't want to say mind your own business, that's rude, but people there ask\nyou, what's your income, where do you live, what do you have? | never would think\nto ask somebody, even somebody I'm very close, it's not my business. And | never,\nand | had no father, no mother, nothing for many years, | would never be jealous,\nand that's a character. Or envious, that's the same as jealousy, that you have that\ndress that cost five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars and | can't afford it, or\nwhat. Because if I'll be jealous, it won't help me get that dress because | can't\nafford it if | don't have that three, five hundred dollars. And it won't make me\nhappier if I'll have that dress. And if | didn't pay for the dress, it would make me\nworse because why should | go with a dress that | owe the money and | don't know\nfrom where | will take the money. And | never had an envy or jealous character.\nThey always ask me, are you not jealous, this cousin has this, has this, has this.\nSometimes | say, poor me, | have no children and it's a pity. But then | see the\nproblems my friend have with their children, | say I'm very happy | don't have, what\ndo | need this problems for, | have enough of my own. So, it won't help to be\njealous.",
        "Q: Were you ever envious, though, that other people had their whole families and\nmaybe they didn't know what they have?",
        "A: No, but | would be angry and am, not envious exactly, of children my age when |\nwas left alone, they don't appreciate their parents. That, yes. Because | say, they\ndon't Know what they have, they should appreciate what they have, they have\nparents, they have grandparents, they have aunts and uncles and cousins and\nthey, such a big family, they don't know what they have. Some know, but not all.\nNot all the people know. But it won't help me. But | never was, thank God, envious\nor jealous, never, never. | hope | will never be.",
        "Q: How do you explain that you didn't become a really, really bitter person who just\nsaw darkness everywhere, you know, that you lost so much and other people who\nlost what you lost, their entire family...",
        "A: They're more bitter.",
        "Q: And jealous, envious. But how, where did that come from?",
        "A: | think that has to do with upbringing and the character of a person. My mother\nused always to say when you're grown up and you have your own house, if people\ncome, never put three cookies on the table, put always five. Maybe somebody\nwants another cookie. Never say, why don't | have that kitchen set, never say.\nYou'll have it. If you don't have it, it won't help you. She told me, | think, as much\nas | didn't see her long, not to be jealous and envious. Because she wasn't. |\nremember my aunts had so, so much jewelry and so much she didn't have. She\nnever envious.",
        "Q: What do you remember most about your mother?",
        "A: | remember she was a very good person, very good mother. She wanted me to\nlearn ballet, what | wanted, dancing, ballet. And | went for three years and then my\ngrandfather was so religious, he says, \"She cannot dance with her legs nude\". So\nmy mother stopped my ballet. But she was a very good person, very good person.\nNever demanding, she had a hard life, she didn't have the luxury we have to put the\ndishes and put the dishes out. You know? She had a hard life, she didn't have\nsuch a big apartment. | don't know if she had maids or not, | don't remember, but |\nknow she didn't have a washer or a dryer or something like that, that I'm sure. And\nalso the climate was not like here, so, | don't know. We were always clean, | don't\nknow when she washed, when she used to take us from school and bring us from\nschool and help us with the lesson what she could and give me private teacher\nwhen | needed, when | was a little worse in some studies or somethings. No, it\nwas, no. But to tell the true, | don't know. She, | think she taught me not to be\njealous. And | don't want to be jealous, I'm happy. My sister-in-law says a lot of\ntimes, \"When will you change?\" She doesn't want me to be mean to her, to her |\nshould be good, to other people | should be mean. She's also, she's very jealous if\nI'm nice with somebody. She wants to be the first. It's a character. It's like you\nwant everything for yourself and | tell her, \"You are addicted to me\". She say,\n\"Yes\". It's a feeling that a person has. I'm not possessive, | don't want a person to\nbe only mine, she can be everyone's person. But why be possessive? Will it help\u2019?\nNo. It won't help none to be possessive. So what can | help? | don't want to be\npossessive and I'll never be.",
        "Q: Well, when you think of your parents, your mother and your father, what, is\nthere one memory that is sort of like, if you're falling asleep and you want to think of\nthem, is there, what's the moment?",
        "A: The moment is that, they started to make a more living and live a little easier\nwhen they were taken away. And what | remember, as a small child, they had it\nhard, very hard. And then it started to be a little better and everything broke. And\nthey were not rich or well off or what, but they made a nice living, they had two\nchildren and that's it. But it started to be a easier life than in the beginning, |\nremember. She had to go and come and help my father and help in the store and\ncook and have all the problems. You know, mending socks and fixing that, now all\nthat we don't do. We don't have that life. And she had a hard life, very hard life.\nAnd not convenient apartment. | remember when | was a very small child, we didn't\neven have a bathroom, we didn't. Now each child needs his own bathroom. No,\ni's true. We didn't have at all. We . And then there was more comfort\nand then when you can enjoy, you come into 40, then it was middle age, you don't,\nthey take it away from you. That's a pity. They could have enjoyed a little, life, a\nfew good years. That's it.",
        "Q: Do you have nightmares ever?",
        "A: Not especially. But sometimes | would see them and then get up in the morning\nin a very, not good mood to see somebody. Not in a good mood. But it doesn't\nhelp.",
        "Q: Because you saw them the night before?",
        "A: Yeah, saw them at night, not the night before. | saw them, it was like hours and\ni's maybe 10 minutes, but it seems like hours, you see, and then you close again\nyour eyes, you see again. | don't know if you had that. You see somebody and\nthen you want to forget what you saw, and you close your eyes again, you see it\nagain. It must be strong in your mind that you see it again and again. Bult, that's it.\nThat's enough.",

And then when we came\nback, they said that the Jews from Belgium, born in Belgium, would not be taken\naway, the Queen announced. And my aunt was born in Belgium and she didn't\nhide or nothing. But my uncle was sitting there and he lived three days, everything\nclosed, they took them away and he was left because he was hiding. Had a child\none and a half and six years old. Then after three days when he came down, they\nwere gone. And he was closed in the apartment, in the house, it was a house.",
        "A: Two years. Two years. It started and started and people would go away and go\naway, and my parents wouldn't leave my grandfather and that's the reason we\nstayed and that's the reason they were taken away. And my grandfather was taken\naway and then he was 78. My grandmother was taken to a hospital where she\nlived during the war. But my father was a very good son, as you can understand.\nFrom all the five sons, he was the only one who didn't want to leave. That's it.",
        "A: | don't think so because she let him decide and she did what he wanted. That's\nit.",
        "A: Maybe not much, he took me much younger than | was and felt he's older, he\nshouldn't tell me, he shouldn't talk about it. But, that's all what | remember, maybe\nyes, but | don't spoke a lot. We didn't talk.",
        "A: No, he explained to me that I'll be a short while by these people, then they'll\ncome and pick me up to be home.",
        "A: Yes, they said that a lot of my friends were taken away. My best friend, she was\na little older, she said, \"Oh, | am so happy to go away, I'll be able to put blue on my\neyes and lipstick\". And she didn't know where and what she's going. And my\nparents said we want you to be somewhere we know where you are. We don't\nwant you to go with her or what. Because | wanted to go with that friend because\nwe were very close, a Jewish girl. She never came back. She never came back.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, no. No, no.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: She was very good, she was an only daughter, she liked me and when | was\nhiding, she went to my aunt, that | told you was Belgian, she went to bring her food.\nShe went to my grandfather, she went to my parents while they were staying in\nBelgium, and she was extremely good. She would put on a Star of David and go in\nthe Jewish neighborhood, she had black hair so she looked Jewish, so everybody\ntook her for a Jew, but she could have been arrested and taken away because she\nwore the David Star and the David Star here. So, but she said in her mind, \"| want\nto help\". She really was helping and doing most she could. Raphael ,\nThere's a little French there. And that's it. So my uncle, when he was taken away,\nlived with nuns in a convent where there was 50, 40 nuns, nobody knew he is a\nman, nobody knew he is Jewish, only the Mother Superior, the Superior Mother.\nThe Mother in charge from the whole nuns there. She knew that he's a man and\nhe's Jewish. But the nuns didn't know and as he had black hair and a beard, he\nshaved four to five times a day, he wore the clothes as a nun.",
        "A: Yeah, as a woman and a nun. So four or five times a day he would shave and\neat only kosher.",
        "A: Israel Livingston.",
        "A: The woman who used to work for him, the maid, the housekeeper, she knew\nthat monastery, she talked to them and when he was closed in the house, she went\nthrough the roof and went into the house and put him on clothes from her husband\nwho died. Gave him the identity card of her husband that didn't look at all like him.\nAnd she took him by train to the monastery in Brussels. So she put her life at\nstake, too. And they went to Brussels and the Mother Superior knew about him\nand that's it. And he stayed there a year. A full year in the monastery. Dressed\nand lived like a nun, five times a day he shaved.",
        "A: No, he didn't Know that same night, that Friday night, they were religious people,\nthey didn't know they coming for him. They thought they coming for them, not for\nhim, they coming for him, not for them. So they said all the time, stay where you\nare, like hysteric. He was upstairs on the third floor. They were downstairs. When\nthey opened the door, they thought somebody squealed on him and they looking\nfor him. Like they looked for me a few times when | was hidden. But it was not\ntrue. They looked for them and not for him, they didn't know he is in the building.\nSo they took away all the family. And when they saw good furniture or good things,\nthey would close from outside to inside the house, nobody should go in. So they\nseal the house til they take out a family. So they sealed it and he was inside.",
        "A: She would say, \"Look, we have to send you away. It's for your own good, we\nhope to be together soon\". So we thought so. And after the war, we prepared 12\nbedrooms, full bedrooms, and nobody came back. Twenty-eight from the family\nwere taken. Close, you know, father's family, close, aunts and uncles and cousins.\nVery close, 28, were taken away.",
        "A: Maybe three dresses, two dresses, because | used to go to church every\nSunday, they made me go. Because the people in the neighborhood, they\nI'm a niece from out of town. And that dress | would wear Sunday,\nthen nothing, a skirt and a top, maybe. Nothing special. My socks were all hard\nfrom mending, not like now, they mended the socks. | would need the socks, wear\nthem. And they got money for me every month. And once my parents were taken,\nthey were worried. The money will stop. | don't think they would give me up or\nwhat, they wanted to adopt me after the war because they had a sick girl, retarded,\nthey wanted to adopt me and my uncle didn't want me to become Catholic. And\nthey had respect for me, there was never pork in the house while | lived there. But,\nthey were very strict to me, very strict. If | break an egg, | wouldn't get an egg for\nthree days. And the food was not too much. When | had once an accident, they\nwouldn't call a doctor because they were afraid. So, it was not easy when you're\nvery spoiled from home, because | was very spoiled as an only daughter. And\nthat's it.",
        "A: No, only the diary, only the diary, no jewelry. Only the diary, and now I'm more\nin touch than all these years was a cousin of mine that went last week to the\nHolocaust Museum and | got a ticket and she...\n[end of side A of tape one of three]",
        "A: And now we got in touch very much and we're very close again. We were very\nclose as children. And she started to call here and | came now and | said, \"! want\nto give you that page from the diary, if | find my diary\". Then | started to looking.\nOne day I'll give it to you, make you a copy. But she painted me a sheep and she\nsay, \"Our love is forever\". It was the last thing | saw her for many, many years,\nmaybe 30, 40 years | didn't see, didn't hear. Now she lives in Houston, Texas. But\nin the war, no, she was in Ecuador, she wasn't in Belgium. She didn't go through\nanything. And when we met a week ago or two, she didn't believe that | don't get\nmoney from the Nazi war because we went through so much, we said, \"Ours was\nour daughters\". And | told them, | don't know if | said it in my tape, | don't think, how\nthey look to me and so on during the war, they were sitting and crying. But | went\nthrough losing my husband that | can't cry. It's not good, it's healthier\nwhen you cry. But | cried a lot after the war and then later | can't. It's inside, you\nsee, some people cry fast, but | can't. | just can't cry so fast.",
        "A: | kept it all the time in the war. And then when | moved from Israel here to get\nmarried, | got married.",
        "A: | started in Belgium, my parents gave it to me, like diary with a little mirror. And |\nstarted to write, to give it to my friends, and they all signed, most are not there. You\nknow, children. And then, at the end, in the diary, if you see, it's written about my\nparents, my cousin who was taken away and how | feel and how I, and it was very\nsensitive. But then when | made the tea, | say, \"If you want | give you that copy\u201d.\nSo they say, \"No, | want the original\". So | gave the original.\ndid you have when you were in hiding? When you were sent away to a family of\nyour best friend?",
        "A: It was a bad feeling. It was a feeling like lost because | always had my parents\nnear me and | was spoiled and loved and cherished. But they tried to be very nice,\nthe man was very, very intelligent and he wanted me only to study, study, gave me\nprivate lesson in German. And then he put me by the nuns to study, studied\nEnglish and French literature. He wanted me only to study. And by the way, last\nweek | wrote a letter to Ellie(ph) Vazel(ph) about somebody and | wrote about me\nand he wanted me only to study and know more because he knew a lot. And they\nhad a retarded child, as | told you and the marriage was not very successful. And |\nwas very naive because when the army came, the English army, we had an\nEnglishman living there, started a little, started with his wife, but | didn't know\nbecause they brought me up, | was at the age 15, 16, like a little girl of seven, eight.\nHe wanted me only to study, only to study. And | must be thankful to him, the\nlanguages, what | know now, is all thanks to him because he insisted | should\nstudy.",
        "A: Collette and Henri, French names. And the family name was very French,\nGramoulet(ph). Big, , like in Holland and Belgium, ,",
        "A: Yeah, Gramoulet, big windmill, translate word by word, but that's a name, a\nfamily name.",
        "A: Yeah, only French.",
        "A: Oh, they had a beautiful home. Beautiful garden. But a lot of shooting during\nthe war because it was near a train station and they said to the neighbors that | was\na little sick and | cannot stay in a big city, so they, it was around 50 miles from\nBrussels. They, | cannot stay in the city with my parents, | have to have fresh air of\nthe suburbs, that's the reason they took me. And they want me to stay with them.\nBut | had a lot of, lot of accidents. That being the first and the worst accident was\nthat | went to a man who gave me an identity card. You need cards for food and\nidentity. And | saw that big truck with people from the German and | couldn't hide\nand | couldn't run away. But inside the truck was a boy who knew me from\nBelgium, from Antwerp. And his parents wanted him to stay, they\ndidn't know him and they didn't want, so he said to somebody in the wagon that |\nam Jewish, not Catholic. So they looked at me, but | had disappeared. | wasn't\nthere, so the German looked for me after that in every house they came, there was\nmaybe in the street, five like houses, villas they called it. And they looked but they\ncouldn't find me because it took five minutes to stretch between the tennis, you and\n| play tennis, there is the, you know, what's in between us, the net, that's between\nus, goes like that, so when you turn it that was like steps and | took it up on the\nattic, | took it up.",
        "A: No, the net, we used to take the net and put it here and that is the attic, | would\ngo up.",
        "A: Yeah. | would go up the kind of stairs, take up the net, close the door and that\nwas the attic, you could not put a ladder, you could not put a chair and go up, you\ncouldn't reach, only with that net.",
        "A: You did it. And closed the door. | was small, but stayed there three hours.\nWhen | came back, | was half fainted because it was a chimney, like a chimney,\nyou know, for the coal and so | was half fainted when they took me out from there.\nThey looked three-quarter of an hour in the house.",
        "A: At the same moment it was like, just I'm going to faint, that | felt like I'm going\nany minute to faint because it was hot from the coal and it was hot from that going\nup in a rush. It's not that you take it easy, you go slowly, | had to make it in two\nminutes, go up, take the net, close the door from inside, it was all, and don't forget, |\nwas very childish. It's not that you're grown up and you know what you do, why,\nwhat, when. But at the same moment you do it because you feel you want to live.\nYou want to stay alive. And the second day...",
        "A: No, laying, laying.",
        "A: | can hear not good because the door is closed, but | can hear a little. A little.\nLike screaming saying, \"To hell with it, where is she? Isn't she here?\" \"No\". But |\nhave a feeling she's here. \"Is she here?\" \"No\". And it would go on and go on for\nhalf an hour. And you would stand just here and | am just on top of you. So any\nminute | thought you'll find out, but you had no way. If you're smaller, you had no\nway to come up, because it was too narrow and too small and you couldn't come\nup. And then the second day from that, they didn't give up on me. They say they\nknow that they have a Jewess at . So it went so fast.",
        "A: Sure there was some hiding a Jew. So they came unexpected, |\ndidn't have the time to go up, so they put me in the garden and then like buried me.\nThey put earth on me and | was there. The same time, the next day.",
        "A: My aunt, my aunt. They digged a hole, they put me in, they covered the hole\nand they were looking in the garden, but there was no sign, there was nothing, you\nunderstand? Because there was no sign that there was somebody, there was\nplants and there was potatoes or something.",
        "A: | don't Know, | remember that | was sick for two days after that, | was staying in\nbed and | was crying all the time. Because | didn't know why they did it to me. She\nsay, \"It's for your own good\". She was very, very nice, very stingy, | remember, but\nvery nice. Very warm person, but stingy, very stingy. That was all in one week.\nThe attic, , and the third day, it was not finished. | was supposed to go\nto the man who gave me the identity card. And it was not like from here to the\ncorner, it was not far and he had to change something on my identity card, it was in\nRaphael's name. So he, he saw | am young and he take advantage, he say, \"I\ninsist, you should tell me that's your real name\". It's not my real name. | say, \"It's\nmy real name\". | wasn't so stupid. And he insisted, | wouldn't tell. So\nthen he say, you know, \"Leave me your identity card here. Next Monday, I'll give it\nto you\". And | had a feeling, sixth sense, not to give him, | say, \"I'll give it to you\nSunday\". | came home and | cried, | say, \"He wanted that card\". She says, \"You\ndidn't give it to him?\" | say, \"No, | had a feeling not to\". She say, \"My child, do\nwhatever you feel\". The next morning she came to me and she hugged me, she\nsay, \"You know, they killed him\". He was on his way somewhere and he had\nidentity cards, 25 or 30, and all these people were taken away. You didn't know if\nhe worked for the Germans and for the American, for both.",
        "A: Double. So they never knew who killed him. But the people were all taken\naway. She was very, very happy that | didn't give him the card because there was\nthe address and the name and the age, everything on the identity card. So she\nwas very happy.",
        "A: | didn't dig it. They digged it maybe two or three days in advance in case they\nneeded it. They prepared. | didn't dig it. Not | knew, not | would. No, | didn't dig\nthat hole.",
        "A: Nothing, nothing. Just plain, yeah. Just alive.",
        "A: Maybe half an hour she told me. But it was like a year. But it was only a half a\nyear, a half an hour, that's all. No, and | could never have a doctor like one time |\nmade soap and | burned all my hands, here | have signs and they would not call a\ndoctor. All that boiling water and soap, we didn't have soap, so we made soap\nourselves, they couldn't call the doctor because they were afraid. The only thing is,\n| went Sunday to church and that's all. For now. She used to say, \"You pray for\nyour God. | know you don't pray, but you pray for your God\". | say, \"Not supposed\nto pray for your God in a church\". | said, \"You have to go to a synagogue, you\ncannot pray in a church\". She say, \"You can\".",
        "A: | don't think you can pray in a church for a synagogue, | don't think so.",
        "A: They comforted me, but not like a mother. Not like a mother. | don't know how\nyou feel with your mother, but it was missing because it was not the comfort of a\nmother. But they tried to calm me down, make me calm. Bult, it was not too strong,\nthe comfort. Maybe at that time, at that moment, going through what | went\nthrough, | was a little hard and | overcome this. You understand? But, you know.\nThat's what | did.",
        "A: No, but | felt like, go, a certain moment, it was like they go on top of me, but\notherwise, | don't know where they are. But when they walk near me, it felt like you\nwalk on my head. But that's all, but | didn't react. Maybe | was too weak or maybe\n| was mixed up or maybe | was anxious and nervous from what's happening. They\nwould say in advance, | would say, \"! don't accept, | won't do it\". And then | did it\nbecause they wanted me to do it.",
        "A: No, they say, we might have to do that. | say, \"| would prefer to go up in the\nattic\". She said to wait and see what situation will be. Then the situation didn't\ncome to go to the attic and they had no other way than to do that. Because if they\ndon't save me, they would be taken away to one because all the of the\nfamily, we gave somebody, and the son squealed on the father, they took away his\nfather and all the silver of the family. So | told her to , | read it in the\npaper what, so she said, \"You see, God forbid if they take you, they take us away,\ntoo because we wanted to save you. So we also in danger as much as you are\".\nShe explained to me, she says, \"So, you have to do what we tell you to do because\nwe just in danger like you are\". So | decided to do what she tells me.",
        "A: Aunt.",
        "A: | got up in the morning and | was, | was in a very bad mood because | didn't\nknow what the day is going to bring and they had a, like a maid who would take\ncare of the daughter and they would let me help her. And they would teach me\nhow to take the dust, not like that, like that. How to clean house. All that what my\nmother never asked from me. She said, \"One day you'll be on your own. If you're\nrich, you'll have a maid. If you don't know what to do with yourself, you won't be\nable to tell her how to do it. So | want you to know, | want you to do it. And then\nyou can give orders to somebody else. But first, you have to teach yourself to do it.\nYou have to decide your own, because you never know, maybe you have no\nparents one day\". She knew that it might happen. She wanted to prepare me\nmentally, as well as her husband who, | told you, was very intelligent and was very\nrealistic and he thought it might happen that she will be alone left, so let's prepare\nher. But, | didn't want to think about it. Sometimes you know it's going to happen,\nbut you don't want, you don't want to think it's going to happen, you don't want to\naccept it. But that's it.",
        "A: | lived two years. They wanted, also, after the war, not to give me back, they\nwanted to adopt me when my uncle came and stayed. But the aunt was not\npleasant because she left her husband and went away with the Englishman and for\na long time the husband thought that | had something to do, that | helped her out.\nAnd | didn't know, | was very naive. They used to go everything, Monday, to\nBrussels, and they took me along, we went to movie, we went shopping, after the\nwar, the wife of my uncle, my aunt. And then one day | became sick, they went by\nthemselves, they never took me again. They liked to be by themself. | didn't know\nwhy, they had an affair, | didn't know what's an affair. | didn't know what's an affair.\nSo he was a little angry at the end, he say, \"I give so much of myself to that girl and\nshe didn't be thankful to me\". So my uncle said, \"She was naive, it's not that she\nwas mean or what. She didn't understand\".",
        "A: The uncle, the non-Jew. Yes.",
        "A: The pretend uncle thought | have a role by helping them to get together while |\ndidn't understand and | didn't want to say that on the tape, I'll tell you later, | didn't\nunderstand. That I'm helping or not, | didn't grasp, | wasn't like that.",
        "A: A week or two, that's all. A week or two. Two weeks, that's all, not more.",
        "A: The people who lived next door to us would call him at work, my uncle, my\npretend uncle, but then they stopped calling. And when they were taken away, and\nthe money finished, every three months they paid for me, they paid money, they\nshould keep me. So she used to say to me, \"How will we get the money?\"\nBecause they also took me a lot because of the money they needed, naturally. So\nthe man, the owner from the apartment, non-Jew, used to send the money every\nthree months like before. His own money.",
        "A: No, the owner of the apartment where we lived, my parents, he sent his own\nmoney because he said later, he was afraid maybe I'll give me up or what and he\nsend the money every three months. And we in touch with his son, he's dead. His\nson is in touch and he would say the nicest thing in every letter for Christmas and\nNew Year that he writes me, \"My father didn't save you to go to a country where\nthere is war all the time. My father didn't save you\". Every year he writes me the\nsame sentence. A nice man, he's around my age and he's nice. We used to play\nwhen we were young and he's very nice, he writes me very nice letters. And such\nkind of people | like get in touch and like to be in touch.",
        "A: Half a year, four months. Four months.",
        "A: A long time after that they told me. They didn't tell me that when it was fresh,\nmonths after that, they didn't want me to know, they didn't know what reaction | will\nhave and they didn't know. They didn't tell me that when it was fresh.",
        "A: My aunt, my aunt. It was Raphael, yeah, Raphael told her a few days after\nbecause she didn't live far away, but she told me. She first prepared me a little and\nshe say, you know, \"They're deporting a lot of Jews from Antwerp\", and they would\nnever had been deported so fast if not that woman because in the street where we\nlived, was two Jews, a man and a family and we, like | told you, it was not a Jewish\nneighborhood. But if not that woman, maybe they will stay til after the war or\nmaybe a few months, but it was not a Jewish neighborhood and all the people\nknew each other and they would never squeal like she did. She really squealed on\nthem.",

She\ndidn't know that I'm alive and that | was hidden and she, when the German came,\nwanted to take, like | told you, my brother, hid him under her bed, didn't want. So\nshe knew and she saw when they were taken away, she told me everything then.",
        "A: She got so excited, nervous, she didn't know that | was alive and at the same\nmoment, she remembered that she wanted to save my brother and he didn't want\nto stay with her, so she was so, | don't know how to say in English, she was very,\nshe was out of herself seeing me in there, it was not that she hit me from anger or\nwhat, she was so, she couldn't believe that it's me in the stair. If |, it would be 20,\n30 years you can change, but that was three, four years, so | didn't change so\nmuch in the four years, that she didn't recognize me. And | was with my uncle, my\nuncle didn't understand, too, and then she excused herself, we went to drink a cup\nof coffee and she explained. And she told us that and then at night, the same night,\n| was very hysterical. And what my uncle did to calm me down, but | was very, |\nknew they not coming back, but the way she told us in there, it was reopen the\nwound they call it. It was like reopening a wound. That's it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was bad information and you wanted to know, so it's both together, you\nunderstand? It was information, good and not good. It can be sad, if it's good or\nnot good.",
        "A: Around 16, 16.",
        "A: Yeah. No, when | was, a month or two after they were deported. When | heard\nthey wouldn't come back, we used to have 13 bedrooms and then every two days\nmy uncle would sell another bedroom because he saw there is nothing, nobody\ncoming back. And we had saved a few apartments from the family, we had a big\nhouse with a lot of bedrooms. So every night | would come back, there would be\nanother bedroom for me. See and it was very demoralizing, very. And then my\nuncle took his package and went to South America. And | stayed in Belgium.",
        "A: | was with my uncle and it was...",
        "A: No, no. It was my real uncle, after the war and they, | don't remember, it was\nsome friends of my uncle that they heard from somebody else that was in the camp\nwith my parents. And they saved themself. There was a few, very few, people that\ncame back from Auschwitz, not many. Maybe if my brother wouldn't have gone in\nthe line for my father, because they took younger people separate, he would have\nlived, but he wanted only to be with my father, he was very close to my father. And\nhe was young, they would have kept him, they would put him to work or, but he\ndidn't want.",
        "A: Yeah. Maybe.",
        "A: Oh, that was months after, two months after | was hiding. My pretend aunt.\nYeah. The man, who later on paid for me, must have called or written to her about\nthat. And if | didn't get any mail, | never looked at the mail, understand.",
        "A: No, no, no. | knew they were deported, but at that time we didn't know what and\nwhen or Auschwitz, no, we didn't know. Didn't know. Some of the people who\nwent to Auschwitz, | read a lot about it, didn't Know. They didn't know. But, like\nagain, | tell you, if they would have, if they would take me, they would take my\npretend aunt and uncle because there were a lot of people that happened to them.\nAnd some Jews squealed on other Jews, like that boy who wanted to squeal on\nme. He said, \"Why should | go, why shouldn't she come?\" | don't know what an\ninterest, | wouldn't do it because why should | take you? It's enough I, but people\nare selfish so they want you to be in the same situation...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2\nAugust 5 in Silver Spring, Maryland. This is tape number two, side A. Did, was\nyour friend, Raphael, whose papers you had, you were pretending to be Raphael,\nwas she ever able to come visit you during that time that you were in hiding?",
        "A: | think she was there once, that's all. Yeah. Because they tried not to have\npeople over, they say they brought over their niece, me, and they didn't want.\nBecause she was also a child, she can say something that she shouldn't or what.\nNeighbors and it was not, not recommended. Probably that's what the aunt said, |\nwill have to ask when | see her, God will, how many times or if she came. But |\ndon't think more than once, if | remember well, but I'll have to ask her.\nRaphael? Did they say, Raphael, when they called you?",
        "A: No, when there was no one strange, they wouldn't call me, my name is Anny,\nthey wouldn't call me Anny, they would call me a short cute name, Annime(ph),\nthat's my Anny, but if you would be there or a stranger, they would call me,\nJeanine(ph). She changed my name from Raphael, Jeanine to Raphael. My\nname, at home and at school was Jeanine, it was a French name. And then she\nchanged it when she went to France and she wants only to be called Raphael.\nMust be that her real name now is officially Raphael, because when | send her a\ncheck | write Raphael, too. So it must be.\nnot, was there ever just a rebellious...",
        "A: Anny Rubenstock(ph).",
        "A: No, never talked. No, you see, that man wanted to know, | never told, because\nshe told me, \"Never tell anyone. You are Jeanine , and that's it.\nNobody ever has to know that\". She never, she didn't let me and | didn't do it. And\n| went to the nuns for the English lesson or what, sometimes they would say,\n\"Jeanine\". | would look, | wouldn't Know, you know? It reminds me they wanted to\ntake me in Israel to the and spy. After the war when | came to Israel\nbecause | know language and | went through so much. So one of my friends spoke\nto somebody about spies, so that man came and he asked me, would | be\ninterested to be in a, would | be interested to be in another country and work for\nIsrael? | say, \"Yes\". They went through with all the, now | don't like to go to a\ndoctor, | went to doctors for months, | went to psychiatrists, | went to everything.\nBut when did | fall through? When they say if | knew to hold a gun, | say, \"No\". |\nsay . But they would go and find out who are my friends, what's my\nfamily, they went in the background. But then when the called the hospital, they\ncalled my name, | don't remember what it was, | jumped up, | forgot it's my,\nbecause | didn't go to my name. They didn't want me to know. It reminds me when\nthey said, \"Jeanine\" in school, | looked like, it's not me. And the teacher says,\n\"Jeanine\". And oh yeah, it's me.",
        "A: At that time, yeah.",
        "A: | don't remember. | don't have one picture from my brother, not one. | don't\nhave it. That's It.",
        "A: Yeah. | have of my parents , my mother, she was a beautiful\nwoman, that's my mother. It's beautiful, no? Yeah. They say she dressed\nbeautiful and she was a beautiful woman.",
        "A: Probably. But look at the clothes.",
        "A: The long clothes.",
        "A: Yeah, that's what they wore then.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Nobody had a sense. At that time, nobody had a sense, nobody knew. They\ndidn't talk about it so much, they didn't know that, we knew it's not good, it's not a\ngood sign because | was reading. | will tell you an example, my aunt, ;\nher mother was English, Polish and her step-father was English, she was 82 years,\nvery religious man, she was 45. She married him for his money. Really.",
        "A: My aunt's mother, my aunt, real aunt. My father's brother's wife. And the man\nwas 82, extremely religious, the woman had only one daughter, my aunt, and\nwanted to leave when she would die, everything her daughter. So she married that\nman to be rich. And | was sitting by my aunt, make believe, and | had a paper, the\nBelgium, was a German, went in the house where she lived, cut her\ntongue and made him a cripple, and they both died. | read it in the paper, my aunt\nnever would have known. | gave her the paper years later. So, , got\nthe money and she married that man at age 43, 82. | remember as a child, he had\na white beard, he was a very old man. You know, when you are 15, 14, 13, anda\nman of 82, an antique, but it was also a for her, she was 42 years, she married a\nman of 84. Just for the money and then he died, she died, she never got the\nmoney. She had to stay with a man so old. So, and then, you know, a man 82 was\nold, now it's not the same, but then, especially a religious and the beard and the...",
        "A: We heard about it and they bombarded a lot of the time, the little town where we\nwere near the train and they bombarded, we were all the time hiding out in the\ncellar. And during the bombardments, the end of the war, and we say maybe the\nproblems will be solved. We didn't know, you know, maybe the people will come\nback. Maybe, the problems will be solved, let's put it this way. But, we didn't know\nwhat to expect. No, you didn't Know. You didn't know what's going to be and\nwhat's going to happen. Not at all.",
        "A: When they were defeated, so my make believe aunt went with me to the nuns\nand told them that | was Jewish, but | liked their behavior and that | studied well and\nthey helped me a lot in life and | went then and | bought a big plant, flowers for the\nMother Superior, who was very nice to me. We were happy. Because they never\nknew, she never told them. It was nice.\nQ; What did they say?",
        "A: They were stunned at first, they looked and they didn't really believe that they\ndid such a thing because they knew as well as she, if | would have been taken, the\nsame would happen to her. She, they knew it and she knew it all along. But she\nhas to hide me but she has to hide that she has me in her house.",
        "A: | think she waited about a week or what, something, to tell them. And to tell\nthem this whole story and my parents were taken away and we don't know what\nhappened, what will happen with me because we didn't hear yet from my uncle that\nhe was alive and she said to the nuns, \"I'll be coming\", because she wants to adopt\nme. You understand that that's a decision that she and her husband made, but\nnothing came out.",
        "A: It was something very, very pleasant, the whole town and everybody.\nEspecially, | was extremely, extremely happy and jovial, how do you say, because |\nknew maybe | will see my parents soon and my brother, my family, so it was my\nwish. Everybody had another wish, to see their beloved or what, but |, | just\nthought about that, that soon, to me | will go to my parents, that they\nwill be better than her. You understand? But it took time. Then after a few weeks,\nmy uncle came and, well, he came from the nuns and he had taken his house back.",
        "A: Nobody.",
        "A: They had taken out a lot, the German furniture, good things, antiquities, but\notherwise they left the house and it was not , but it was a terrible\nfeeling to go in the house because | remember like now, there was a long hall and\nthere was a little shoe of the little girl they took away, a year and a half, it was on\nthe floor, that she lost. So, a million and a half children they killed,\nwhat do you want. A million and a half. That's a lot.\nQ; So you went in the house with him and there were some of these items from, it\nwas like going into a time capsule?",
        "A: It was terrible. An example, the pot was on the gas for a year and a half.\nBecause it was Friday night and they made food, it stays overnight, cooking\n, you know what it is because they wouldn't cook on Saturday. And\nthat pot was on the, you know, it's like you leave now all dead and | come back and\nsee four empty glasses while nobody lived here. Who were the four people? Who\ndrank from that. So it's a very, very unpleasant feeling. So then, when | met\npeople, they didn't go through nothing, they stayed with their husband and children\nand they saved themself, they're getting money from Germany and how much you\nwant. So it hurt me. Because | say, even if | wouldn't need the money I'll give it to\nRaphael, but it should come to me more than to you that you had your family, you\nstayed all over the war with your family. That's a big plus. Right?",
        "A: It was a good feeling, good feeling. But, | still, at that time, | suffered a lot from\nmy eyes, | cried a lot, | cried day and night. And | came to my uncle and | say, \"I\nwant to see you, but | want to see my parents\". The he took me to see my\ngrandmother who spent all the war in the hospital, | told you and came out. She\nwas the first funeral, Jewish funeral in Antwerp when she died. But before she died\nand | used to come to her, she was a little mixed up, but still she would say, \"Why\ndoesn't your father come to see his mother, why do you come to see me?\"\nUnderstand? She didn't grasp the situation. | didn't know then. But she was the\nfirst funeral, my uncle was very upset. So, he said, \"If you don't stop crying, I'll put\nyou in with your grandmother because you have to stop crying\". But some people\ncan cry when they're told enough. It's a thing that's inside. Or you cry or you don't\ncry, right?",
        "A: Oh, a lot.",
        "A: Cried a lot.",
        "A: Yeah. Now, when my husband died, | cried a little bit, | can't cry and that's bad.\n| envy these people who crying, crying, crying, for no reason. And when you\n, you cry, it's good. It's very healthy they told me.",
        "A: He didn't know at the time. He didn't know. He only said, \"Let's hope they come\nback\". At that time, there was still a lot of hope. You understand? Everybody\nhoped it will go okay.",
        "A: | went to these people who paid for me and | was very nice to them. What a gift.\nAnd my uncle paid them back for all these years that they paid, you know, they\nwere very nice. | went to say hello to them. But it was a half a year after | stayed\nwith my uncle. And all my friends started to go out, have a good time and | never\nhad a good time. Because | worked. My uncle opened a store in Belgium and |\nused to sell the American, the English, [phone ringing, pause in tape].",
        "A: Yeah. No, it was, after that, came a nephew from his wife, from Treblinka. And\nhe was Polish and didn't know Belgium, but he heard somebody is\nand he stayed with us. And my uncle when to South America, he wanted\neverything, everything. He came back from Treblinka where he saved himself.\nAnd that's it. He came like from nowhere.",
        "A: | don't remember because he used to talk very badly Jewish, a lot of lot of Polish\nand | didn't know a word of Polish. But he spoke very little. When he came, he\nweigh maybe, he was maybe like that. So later he gained weight and he became\nmore person. But when he came he was very depressed and my uncle helped him\na lot. But otherwise, it was the two of us, that's all.",
        "A: | tell you, | heard that they were taken away a few weeks after | was hidden.\nAnd then only after the war, a month or two, maybe later, they started to\nus that people were killed and gassed and so on. Before that, people\ndidn't know, we didn't know what happened. Then we were, started to understand\nand to know.",
        "A: My thought was that it happened, but not maybe to them. At that point, and\nvery selfish, but | thought, no, it didn't happen to them. It happened,\nbut not to them. See, you don't realize that it can happen to your own, too. You\nthink it's only to, that's all.",
        "A: A friend of my uncle came back who saved himself.",
        "A: | didn't know the man, it's a man who knew my uncle and who came back and\nwho said that he had been with my parents and my brother, and he knows they\ngone. He knows. How the man saved himself or what, | don't remember, | can't tell\nyou. But he saved himself.",
        "A: My uncle never told me. Maybe he didn't want to hurt me or maybe he didn't\nwant me to know or anyway, in short, he never told me specifically what, when and\nhow. He didn't. | think he didn't want it.",
        "A: | think he knew. More than he told me.",
        "A: Yeah, | asked a few times and | insisted a few times, and he would change the\nsubject and tell me, \"One day soon I'll tell you more if | Know. If! meet aman\". But\n| didn't ask, | Know my uncle, he asked, but he didn't want to, didn't want me to ask,\nyou understand?",
        "A: Brother, right.",
        "A: Yeah. Also, somebody told him and how they, it was his father, his wife, his two\nchildren and his parents-in-law. They had another daughter who was pregnant\nseven months who went to France, they went to the France that was not occupied\nand they paid a fortune and they was taken there with somebody, but they were\nshot while crossing the border. With the money they paid and everything and she\npregnant, walking hours at night, they were shot. And she was young surely, 26,\n25, | don't know.",
        "A: No. We didn't...",
        "A: | never saw them, | never saw them. And then when | came after the war, that\nwoman and that man that were with the American who saved himself and worked\nunderground, they say they had moved shortly after my parents were taken away.\nMaybe they were afraid, | don't know, she moved. She was there living with two or\nthree daughters, | don't remember, but she was, I'm going to smoke a cigarette. Do\nyou mind? Five minutes.",
        "A: Oh, no. They had some things, but people they never gave back. And the\nstrangers that | came to wouldn't let me in. No. And meet my sister-in-law, Patty.",
        "A: Strangers, people. That | never met, they didn't know me and wouldn't let me\nin. The owner of the house, | stayed a while with him, he say he can't ask them, if\nthey don't want. So | went. But | went to this neighbor, who wanted to save my\nbrother, and she accepted me really, the one who wanted to slap my face. She\nwas very nice. She didn't slap my face because she was mean or what, it was a\nkind of excitement and surprise to see me. You know? If you think that person is\nno more and suddenly you find out the person is there, it's a very big, it was\nsomething she'll never forget as long as she lives. She was an old woman then,\nshe must be dead, but she was very, and then it's her nature, she was very\nexcitable in general, | remember as a child, so when she saw me and that uncle of\nmine, she, she got so hysterical, I'll never forget as long as | live how hysterical.\nFrom happiness.",
        "A: It was, it's a pity you don't know French, otherwise | would send you copies, she\nwrote me like, now that my husband died, and she writes to me very often. The\nway she writes, she writes very well. She has nobody, no sister, no brother, no\nnothing. And she's very, very, very warm and close to me. She, for days and days,\nshe wouldn't leave me. She'd come to my uncle every day in the morning and stay\ntil at night because she was so happy to see me and be with me and that. And she\nloved Israel. We went to the Hilton in Jerusalem and my husband wanted to stay\novernight. She wants to go to a kibbutz. She doesn't want to stay. Very simple,\nbut very nice, very nice. And she happened to be a very intelligent girl that her life\nchanged now, but she was over-excited so in 1960 my aunt went to\nNice in France and she took care of her house, because with a lake and a\nswimming pool and everything in Nice. And | lived in Israel and she wanted me to\ncome. She told the man, \"In case you want me to take care of the house, there is\ncondition that | have to bring her over, | want to see her for six weeks\". So | went\nthere, everybody in Israel thought, she must be rich, she goes to Nice for vacation\nfor six weeks. It was a luxury then. Now, everybody travels, but then it was a\nluxury. And she invited Raphael, too, for six weeks. But she wouldn't take a cent\nfrom me, you know, she loves me. But she would take from my niece. So |\nremember, | paid for the niece.",
        "A: | was telling her, | was telling her what | went through and that her aunt was very\nnice to me. She was very, very, very stingy, very demanding | should learn and\nstudy and do and kept me busy all the time. And she said, \"I know, that's the\nreason | never wanted to live with her\". But, thank God, she say, she did\nsomething for you. And she was happy and she's happy til now when | write her a\nletter. And when | was sick and my husband died, she would call me from France\nand Israel twice a week and she really can't afford it. So, and she came to Israel,\nshe took out a hundred dollar bill and she said to my husband, \"Can you change it\nin Israeli money?\" He said, \"What do you need money for? Anny pays for you\".\n\"No, no, no. | want to get her a gift\". He says, \"She doesn't need it\". So we gave\nher cash when she left, a few hundred dollars, she wouldn't take, she says she\nwants a check. She's so primitive, a check she won't lose, the money she'll lose,\nmaybe you want to buy something. She's very, but she's not demanding, oh, she's\nso nice. She's very artistic. She wrote to Belgium to a friend of hers who paints, to\npaint me a scarf, hand paint on silk. She would send it from Belgium to France,\nfrom France she would send it to me. Very artistic. And | say, \"What do you\nwant?\" She wants a Star of David. So | send her with somebody, a Star of David\nwith a gold chain. So when she came to Israel, she say, \"Can | have a silver David\nStar?\" \"Why?\" \"One for the weekend and one for the week\". So, but she is a very\ngood, very warm person, very warm person.",
        "A: | told you. After the war, she left him for the Englishman. And he was a little\nangry thinking that | had something to do. When my uncle called him and wrote to\nhim a few times because he wanted him to be on good, on good terms with me, but\nit was hard to make him believe that | didn't know. He told him, she was innocent,\nshe was very naive and so on. And he wouldn't accept it, wouldn't accept it\nbecause he was a very, very cultivated, serious man, while that Englishman was\nvery primitive. And that's the end. And it's a pity he didn't believe my uncle or me\nthat | had nothing to do with that. And that's it. And she used to write to me after\nthe war and she used to be in touch with me, wanting to Know what | do and so on,\nbut that's it.\n[end of side 1 of tape 2]",

And meantime, | stayed in Belgium,\n18, 19, wanted to say in Belgium. But, my dream was all these years, to go to\nSwitzerland to study international translation, instantanic(ph). | couldn't afford and |\nwas too proud to ask my uncle. And I'm sorry to now because they say if | would\nhave asked, they would have helped and | would have a good thing to go on in the\nworld. | could use it anywhere | want. But | didn't do it. So, in Belgium, | really\ndidn't have a job for work and there was that store where they sold blankets and\nsuits from the military, the American, it was very heavy beds, hard job. | went in\nand | said the man | want to work. He say, \"You so little, what will you do here\".\nBut it happened to be the father of my friend, | told you before that said, \"Come with\nme, we'll put lipstick, we'll go out\". And he had remarried and child,\nbut he knew | was his daughter's friend, so he gave me the job. And he kept me, |\ndidn't work too hard, just make believe | work to give me salary because | was so\ngood with his daughter that died. She was a beauty, she was a beauty. Her name\nwas Betty, | remember. Beautiful girl. And then | went to Israel.",

Went\nto visit them and then | stayed there, and that's a mistake | did in my life. Because |\ndidn't want to stay with them and | started, like | worked for nine years in a French\nlibrary, only French. So, my uncle wanted me to go and study Hebrew, but | saw\nthey don't have money and they need my help, so | went and | worked, 10 years.\nThen we opened another store, in a library, in a lending library in Haifa, and |\nbecame the manager, was the only one, only French.",

And then my family wanted me to stay\nin Uruguay. But! said a condition is if | can work and keep up and just come for the\nweekend to you. No, they want me to stay with them and not work. So | took my\npackage, | went back to Israel. And | found out that working in the lending library\nand that was too many hours from eight in the morning to seven at night. So |\nwanted to get shift work. So | worked in Israel for five years and | enjoyed it very\nmuch, in the censor, you know what censor.",

Even now, with all the comfort that\nyou have, you have a lot of comfort like before, used to work without air condition\nand it was hotter than here. But now, everything is beautiful now and it's good.\nAnd people say, \"You're not afraid?\" And I'll tell you on that answer, you never\nknow where to be afraid because | had a very good friend, by the way, who lived in\nIsrael and her son finished college here. And he came back to Israel and they\ndidn't want him to go to the army because maybe he'll be killed or what, God forbid.\nSo they moved to New York and in a few, many years ago, there was something\nnear the, near the, some people went in in the lunch room and they killed some\npeople. And if you will remember a few years ago, and he was one of them. His\nwife was pregnant eight months. So he was killed. Maybe he would have made\nthe army and not be killed. So you cannot be afraid because it won't help you. And\nyou can't live in a country, every minute you be afraid or you'll get crazy.",
        "A: | was all the time tense, as young as | was. And maybe for that I'm still a little\nnervous, but | don't show it. Because now my sister-in-law is not so well, but why\nshould | shout or be angry on her or what, I'm not that type. | was not brought up\nlike that. But inside maybe I'm nervous because | went through a lot and it hurt me\na lot when | didn't get more, or how much did | get? Four or five thousand dollars,\nthat's all from the German. While all these friends that | know, are getting monthly\ngood incomes. One of my friends went and she said that she's not, her mind is not\ngood. She's a year younger than |. So they made her a, an exam. She said stupid\nthings, she's very smart. And now she gets eight or nine hundred dollars a month\non Germany because she's incapable. That's what they say. She's much more\ncapable than | will ever be, but she succeeded by lying and I'm not the type who will\nlie. I'm not going to lie for money. I'm not going to lie for money. But | went\nthrough, like you heard, a lot. And people who went much less through, that |\nknow, and they are alone, they say, you should get more than I, or you should get,\nbut, you should get. You understand?",
        "A: In 1952, 53, and then they gave me the three thousand dollars, | shouldn't have\ntaken it, but nothing to do. And then they refuse and they, now | know the reason.\nMy uncle went through a lot, he lost a wife and two children, but | had a lawyer in\nBelgium, he was no good. That's the mistake. If you would go, it was then, you\nknow, agencies took care of all that, and they would help you and do it. | didn't go, |\nwent to a lawyer who took a lot of money in advance, who didn't go anything.\nMaybe he got six thousand, he gave me three thousand or four thousand. But all\nthese friends of mine, | don't Know if they got a sum, but they got, they get every\nmonth now. And they really don't believe, | wouldn't lie, if | would get, | would say,\nwhy, why the lying? Some people like to lie, | don't like to lie. If | don't get, | don't\nget. I'm not going to say | don't get when | get. Or | get when | don't get.",
        "A: | think it's too late. | think it's too late.",
        "A: I've never gone. You? No, | would never go. No interest.",
        "A: I'll tell you the true, | don't, | went through now a lot, too, last year with my\nhusband being very sick and all the family wanted me to put him away\nand | didn't, | took care. So maybe another year or what, you know, will be more\nrelaxed, maybe I'll do it. Because my cousin wanted very bad to go, the one from\nIsrael, to the place where | was born and where our grandmother was living, but |\nwasn't ready to go with her because he was sick. Now maybe, I'll take a rest a\nyear, if I'm capable to concentrate and relax, maybe | would do it. But not now for\nthe moment.",
        "A: January, so it's still fresh.",
        "A: It's still very fresh.",
        "A: Yeah. Still fresh, so, | was all by myself and it's not easy. So, that's what it is.",
        "A: Was not young, was 78, but , very intelligent man, but very sick. So,\nhe just suffered the last two months, few months. So nothing could be done, so it's\na pity.",
        "A: No. It didn't come out, I'll tell you why | think. Because when we married, his\nmother became old, she stayed with her daughters, we used to go there all the time\nand all the time and years went by and you know, sometimes years go so fast that\nyou don't know. You turn around and you're middle aged, you're old, no? It's like\nthat.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and then also, then also | used to be very friendly with somebody, she\nhad four children and | was there and | took care most of the time of the children\nand now | don't know if they'll recognize me. That's it. Some stay friends with you,\nbut some, ignore you, let's put it this way.",
        "A: When? When | came to Israel?",
        "A: Yeah, | enjoyed it. | enjoyed it. But | had a hard time because used to live in\nthe suburbs and go, and go to Tel Aviv and stay from eight in the morning in that\nheat til seven at night. Not be able to refresh or what. And from one to four, the\nstores would be closed, so | just walked around, | didn't have what to do. So it was\nvery hard, you understand? So | couldn't enjoy life enough because | had a hard\ntime. And | wasn't so close to my family there because | didn't know them so long\nas my other family that | grew up with them. So it was very hard. But | came over\nthat, too.",
        "A: He had two brothers, he had two brothers and they had families. And then he\ngot married, he had his own family. And when the children became bigger, he was\nafraid they'll marry, intermarriage, so he moved everything to Israel. They should\nget married with Jewish girls, that's what they did. Because, you know, so much\nintermarriage, | don't have to tell you, no? So, and he's very religious, so, very\nreligious. So. Lived a Jewish life and always very nice. The women have it very\neasy, a maid costs you thirty or forty dollars a year, a month, so you can afford two\nmaids. And life is easy, but it's still not like in Israel, it's still, it's still different. Like\nhere, it's very nice, but here without a car, without, it's very hard, | don't have to tell\nyou. Where do you live?",
        "A: So it's not easy.",
        "A: That was a few good months after the war. A few good months after the war.\nWhen | saw the reality that the people who came, came already, and other ones\nwon't come. And they began to talk and to show and then we saw that you have to\naccept the truth. And the reality. It was not easy in the beginning because you\nused to see, to go, then they didn't go like now to Auschwitz to look and that.\nPeople didn't go like now to go, but we all the time asked, asked, we heard that\nsomebody came back and we went and maybe he was seeing them and that, that\nmust be the way my uncle found that man who saw my parents. That he found out\nthat that man was in Auschwitz and saved himself and maybe it was the same time,\nand he learned that it was the same time.",
        "A: Very thin, very nervous, very depressed. But, they began to live and they, that's\nit. But in the beginning they were very skinny and very down, mentally and\nphysically, both. That's it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. | never saw that . They were all so like the museum, they\nhave a place in Brussels now, | would like to go and see that, if God willed, if | had\nthe occasion, they have a very, very big place, so much taller than me, and it's\nwritten all the Jews from Antwerp and Brussels who killed where, at Auschwitz or\nBergen-Belsen or, where they were killed. What date exactly and what time, what,\nand | wanted very badly to go. Somebody told me who saw it and my parents were\nin that list. Somebody told me they didn't see the list. So | wanted to go by myself\nonce. | want to see, one day I'll go.",
        "A: It wears very much on me, very, made me very depressed. | started to take an\nanti-depressant and it didn't help me because | was depressed mentally very much.\nAnd then | see it won't help you, being depressed. Talked to myself. But it didn't\nhelp, it didn't help the pills, not talking, it was depressing because some people can\nsee movies and so on and read, they don't mind. But it's, it's a character. Because\n| say | would never over live it, and some people say | don't know how | over lived it\nand they came out.",
        "A: All the pictures | saw '47 and before, and '46, '47. So, that's what it was.",
        "A: No, | keep a date that the rabbi gave me, a rabbi in Israel gave me a date and |\nkeep that day, give a, | give a donation to Schul(ph) that day and we say\nkaddish(ph) and that's all.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That's it, then | might find exactly the day, maybe or approximative. And | would\nlike to go there, but no chance for the last few years because of my husband's\nillness, but one day I'll go. It doesn't do me too good, in '65 | was in Belgium and |\nwent through, went from the house where we lived to where the school was and\nthat. The street didn't change, only the stores and the people change. And it did\nme very bad. Stayed three days and | run away. Three days or two days, it was\ntoo much. And | think it was too much because | was alone. | was not with a friend\nor, | wouldn't do that by myself any more. | would only go with somebody or that |\ncare for or, just somebody, not to go by myself, | wouldn't do it. Also you know, the\nnights to stay there in a hotel alone and remember the streets and that. No, no. |\nwouldn't go back by myself, never.",
        "A: He had a stroke three years ago and his mind is good and that, | don't think he\nfeels like talking about it. | don't think so.",
        "A: Doubt it, | doubt it. He's saw my tape when | showed it in Israel and it made him\nvery, don't know, he didn't feel depressed really, feel dead because in my tape | say\nmy uncle went to Uruguay and left me alone. So it was not a good feeling for\npeople who heard and it was said in the room. You understand? And | couldn't, |\ncouldn't change the tape, the tape was there, the truth was there.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, | felt lost a little because | was young and all my friends had parents and |\nwas no parents, nobody, like left alone. So it hit me a little, you know. Not much,\nbut a little.",
        "A: In Belgium, maybe eight, nine, ten months. It was too long. It's the way you\nfeel.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "A: The feeling, to tell you the true, | had is that people are alone, like me now,\nshould take care of themself, but I'm the person that | like to give and not wait to\nreceive. | like to give from myself, to be good to people, to help people. If it's\nmentally or physically or materially, | like to give, I'm not demanding and I'm not the\nsnob that says | have or don't have. I'm not the type to complain. | had many years\nthat | didn't have and | never complained. And people never knew if | have or not\nbecause | made an impression | have a lot and | liked it because | don't want pity. |\nhad enough pity during my first years, | don't want pity. That means even if | didn't\nhave, whenever somebody came, | had cake and coffee and fruit and everything.\nThe people came shouldn't know the way | feel. | didn't want them to know. And\nI'm now like that, too. Even people in Israel, especially, are very curious. They ask\nyou such private questions that | can't accept.",
        "A: | don't want to say mind your own business, that's rude, but people there ask\nyou, what's your income, where do you live, what do you have? | never would think\nto ask somebody, even somebody I'm very close, it's not my business. And | never,\nand | had no father, no mother, nothing for many years, | would never be jealous,\nand that's a character. Or envious, that's the same as jealousy, that you have that\ndress that cost five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars and | can't afford it, or\nwhat. Because if I'll be jealous, it won't help me get that dress because | can't\nafford it if | don't have that three, five hundred dollars. And it won't make me\nhappier if I'll have that dress. And if | didn't pay for the dress, it would make me\nworse because why should | go with a dress that | owe the money and | don't know\nfrom where | will take the money. And | never had an envy or jealous character.\nThey always ask me, are you not jealous, this cousin has this, has this, has this.\nSometimes | say, poor me, | have no children and it's a pity. But then | see the\nproblems my friend have with their children, | say I'm very happy | don't have, what\ndo | need this problems for, | have enough of my own. So, it won't help to be\njealous.",
        "A: No, but | would be angry and am, not envious exactly, of children my age when |\nwas left alone, they don't appreciate their parents. That, yes. Because | say, they\ndon't Know what they have, they should appreciate what they have, they have\nparents, they have grandparents, they have aunts and uncles and cousins and\nthey, such a big family, they don't know what they have. Some know, but not all.\nNot all the people know. But it won't help me. But | never was, thank God, envious\nor jealous, never, never. | hope | will never be.",
        "A: They're more bitter.",
        "A: | think that has to do with upbringing and the character of a person. My mother\nused always to say when you're grown up and you have your own house, if people\ncome, never put three cookies on the table, put always five. Maybe somebody\nwants another cookie. Never say, why don't | have that kitchen set, never say.\nYou'll have it. If you don't have it, it won't help you. She told me, | think, as much\nas | didn't see her long, not to be jealous and envious. Because she wasn't. |\nremember my aunts had so, so much jewelry and so much she didn't have. She\nnever envious.",
        "A: | remember she was a very good person, very good mother. She wanted me to\nlearn ballet, what | wanted, dancing, ballet. And | went for three years and then my\ngrandfather was so religious, he says, \"She cannot dance with her legs nude\". So\nmy mother stopped my ballet. But she was a very good person, very good person.\nNever demanding, she had a hard life, she didn't have the luxury we have to put the\ndishes and put the dishes out. You know? She had a hard life, she didn't have\nsuch a big apartment. | don't know if she had maids or not, | don't remember, but |\nknow she didn't have a washer or a dryer or something like that, that I'm sure. And\nalso the climate was not like here, so, | don't know. We were always clean, | don't\nknow when she washed, when she used to take us from school and bring us from\nschool and help us with the lesson what she could and give me private teacher\nwhen | needed, when | was a little worse in some studies or somethings. No, it\nwas, no. But to tell the true, | don't know. She, | think she taught me not to be\njealous. And | don't want to be jealous, I'm happy. My sister-in-law says a lot of\ntimes, \"When will you change?\" She doesn't want me to be mean to her, to her |\nshould be good, to other people | should be mean. She's also, she's very jealous if\nI'm nice with somebody. She wants to be the first. It's a character. It's like you\nwant everything for yourself and | tell her, \"You are addicted to me\". She say,\n\"Yes\". It's a feeling that a person has. I'm not possessive, | don't want a person to\nbe only mine, she can be everyone's person. But why be possessive? Will it help\u2019?\nNo. It won't help none to be possessive. So what can | help? | don't want to be\npossessive and I'll never be.",
        "A: The moment is that, they started to make a more living and live a little easier\nwhen they were taken away. And what | remember, as a small child, they had it\nhard, very hard. And then it started to be a little better and everything broke. And\nthey were not rich or well off or what, but they made a nice living, they had two\nchildren and that's it. But it started to be a easier life than in the beginning, |\nremember. She had to go and come and help my father and help in the store and\ncook and have all the problems. You know, mending socks and fixing that, now all\nthat we don't do. We don't have that life. And she had a hard life, very hard life.\nAnd not convenient apartment. | remember when | was a very small child, we didn't\neven have a bathroom, we didn't. Now each child needs his own bathroom. No,\ni's true. We didn't have at all. We . And then there was more comfort\nand then when you can enjoy, you come into 40, then it was middle age, you don't,\nthey take it away from you. That's a pity. They could have enjoyed a little, life, a\nfew good years. That's it.",
        "A: Not especially. But sometimes | would see them and then get up in the morning\nin a very, not good mood to see somebody. Not in a good mood. But it doesn't\nhelp.",
        "A: Yeah, saw them at night, not the night before. | saw them, it was like hours and\ni's maybe 10 minutes, but it seems like hours, you see, and then you close again\nyour eyes, you see again. | don't know if you had that. You see somebody and\nthen you want to forget what you saw, and you close your eyes again, you see it\nagain. It must be strong in your mind that you see it again and again.
