        "Answer: My pleasure.",
        "Q: We know that this is not about the easiest of topics, and we\u2019re very grateful that\nyou\u2019ve agreed to share your story with us.",
        "A: It\u2019s fine, thank you.",
        "Q: You\u2019re welcome. Let\u2019s start 1i\u2014 where we always start, and where they say in the\nfairly tales, too, let\u2019s start at the beginning.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about who you are as a child: when you were born, the\ndate you were born, the family you were born into, and we\u2019ll take it from there.",
        "A: Okay. I was born in 1938, June 2, 1938, in Iasi, Romania. And we all lived ina\ncourtyard, the whole family, cousins. I have a brother, his name is Morris, and my\nmom and dad. And my dad was a tailor, but he was a designer, and we were quite\ncomfortably well off in Iasi. And I believe at the time that war broke out, which\nwas, I think I was four years old, and there was a lot of commotion out in the\nbackyard; meaning actually the front part of this courtyard where about four of our\nfamily, different families lived; which grandparents usually just buy a house and\nOctober 15, 2009\ncontinue to build so the family can stay together. And this commotion started, and\nmy grandma \u2014",
        "Q: Can I stop right there? We\u2019re still gonna talk about family at this moment, before\nthe war breaking out.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I'd like a few more details.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Is the \u2014 was this courtyard in the building where your family lived, was it 1n in\nthe middle of a town, li \u2014 in Iasi, or was it over to the side, was it a suburban area?\nHow would you describe that?",
        "A: I would \u2014 the little bit of memory I have of it is, it was more on the side, it\ndefinitely wasn\u2019t in the main city. Iasi is a very small shtetl, which is like a little\ntown, and it was definitely in the farmer part, very rural. And my cousins, my\ngrandmother \u2014 my grandfather wasn\u2019t alive when I was born, and my grandmother\nlived in one of the houses, and I\u2019m not sure if one of the cousins lived with her.\nThen there were other cousins. And I\u2014 my memory serves me, we \u2014 there had to be\nabout four or five families. My \u2014",
        "Q: All related to you?\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: All related. And we lived in this courtyard that apparently, before my time, I\nguess my grandparents built this, and just kept on expanding as people got married.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t farming country, 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t farming country.",
        "Q: \u2014 farming country.",
        "A: On the side there were farms, but we weren\u2019t into farming. I believe my\ngrandfather, who I never had a chance to meet, was a fisherman. Very well-to-do\nand very well acknowledged in the community, which my mother always told me he\nhad a great big monument that was dedicated to him. I never had the pleasure of\nmeeting him. We, I remember, lived in the front part, whether we were the last\nfamily, or my mother was yul \u2014 the youngest to get married, and I think she was,\nthat\u2019s where we lived, and my father, being a tailor, worked out of the house.",
        "Q: So it sounds like \u2014 it sounds like you lived in either a small town or a village, but\nin \u2014 inside the village, rather than 1-in the ac \u2014 in a really rural are \u2014 areas. When\nyou\u2019re a tailor \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I would say inside, yes \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: When you\u2019re a tailor, then you have clients that come on the main street, or a side\nstreet, and they come with their \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014",
        "A: But he wasn\u2019t just a tailor my father, he really \u2014 some people use patterns, he\nmade his own pattern, and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s another part of later on in the story. And he\nactually designed women\u2019s coats. So it was, you know, out of the house, and he had\na couple people working for him.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s like a dressmakers\u2019 shop.",
        "A: Exactly, not so much female \u2014 both, but mostly coats. Coats, jackets. And I\nremember as young as I was, which I had to be about four years old, that\u2019s when my\nmemory serves me, is I remember my grandmother took care of both my brother and\nmyself. My brother Morris is two years older than I am. And \u2014",
        "Q: That was one of my questions.",
        "A: Yes, and my grandmother, who was well in her, I would say 80\u2019s, who was more\nlike a mother, she really brought us up, because my mother worked with my dad,\nand there were other workers; so they obviously were well off enough, cause there\nwas help. But we were taken care of by my grandmother.",
        "Q: Do you remember your father in the shop at all, or do \u2014",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, I could \u2014",
        "Q: What kind of me \u2014 what kind of memories come to your mind?\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: About my father?",
        "Q: About your parents, their working in the shop.",
        "A: My mother was slim, pretty, fortunately did not, and later on in the story I'll\nexplain, did not look Jewish, which is what saved us. My dad \u2014 I resemble my dad\nmore than my mom \u2014 was just \u2014 I \u2014 in my eyes just a wonderful, kind, very gentle\nwith us. And he \u2014 he \u2014 they were busy, but my dad was never too busy to pay\nattention, to myself especially, being the girl.",
        "Q: Well, you were the little girl, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the cousins I remember as young \u2014 going way back in my\nmemory, my favorite place at the time, from what I\u2019m told, and I do remember is the\nplay \u2014 the house must have been up on stilts or something, because the kids played\nunderneath, in the dirt. And my cousins and I, that\u2019s what I remember wa \u2014 we\u2019re\ngoing way back, and my mother and my dad and my brother reminded me that that\u2019s\nwhere we loved to play, in the mud underneath. And my cousins loved to throw\nstones, and a couple of times actually cracked my head, and \u2014",
        "Q: And boy, did they get into trouble.",
        "A: \u2014 being that Romanians are Gypsies, my mother had her theories about certain, I\nguess holistic, or whatever. If you have a wound on your head, you get bread and\nOctober 15, 2009\nvinegar and put it on the wound. And those things I remember being told to me\nbecause that\u2019s how it affected my brain.",
        "Q: Well, did you \u2014 do you remember having a \u2014 you know, th-the bump on your\nhead , do you \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Oh yeah?",
        "A: And I reconnected this way back with my cousins who are the only ones who\nsurvived in Israel, and reminded me that that\u2019s what he did, and very happy about tt.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But that\u2019s about where it \u2014 it stops, til war.",
        "Q: And do \u2014 was this then your world, the world of the courtyard, your family \u2014",

And the neighbors next door, that part I remember, were just looking at\nus. And I was young, and my \u2014 my mother didn\u2019t look Jewish, and my father was\ntaken out with a lot of other men, and there were guns and things, and thi \u2014 all I\nremember th \u2014 my grandmother taking my head, and hiding it in \u2014",
        "Q: In her stomach.",

And I remember she had a fat belly. And\nthey shot, something came out of her belly, and I remember a \u2014 it was a \u2014 a fetus.\nOctober 15, 2009",

        "A: \u2014 she said, just \u2014 just kill me, you\u2019ve already killed me, just kill me. And I\nthought well, it\u2019s a matter of time where they\u2019re gonna get my mother, they\u2019re gonna\nget my brother, they\u2019re gonna get my grandmother.

The only memory I have after that, we were\nfairly well off, and I think there were even people who helped my mom clean the\nhouse, and obviously my dad must have been doing all right, is suddenly, two\n[indecipherable] we were si \u2014 all sleeping in our house, ourselves, my mother and\nmy father, and \u2014",

My\nmom was like right next to these \u2014 they were Germans. And she wasn\u2019t wearing the\nband, and I couldn\u2019t understand why we were wearing the yellow band. And my\nfather was there and they took all the men, and it looked like some of them were \u2014\nthey \u2014 they were fucking them with the gun. And I thought they\u2019re gonna kill my\nfather. And I couldn\u2019t understand how we were doing that, we were wearing the\nband and all, and she wasn\u2019t. And then she said what she did. From there on, I don\u2019t\n\u2014 I can \u2014I can\u2019t remember just exactly what happened except this horrible, horrible\n\u2014 this woman being shot, and yelled whe \u2014 I don\u2019t even remember, I remember my\ngrandmother just took and put our heads in the apron so that we couldn\u2019t hear\nanything, she covered our ears, and I \u2014 it\u2019s like everything blacked out from there.\nThere could never be a worse enemy or a worse thing I could ever see in my life\nother than what I just saw there.

        "Q: Do you have a feeling, when you looked at the neighbors on the \u2014 on the other\nside of the picket fence, were they \u2014 did you have any sense of how they were\nlooking? Was it curiosity, was it horror, was it grief?",
        "A: I-I-",
        "Q: Were these people you knew well and liked, or were they distant?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t really remember. All I do remember is they didn\u2019t tell, because they\nknew my mother was Jewish, and I think they were in awe, and I think it was a\ncombination of everything you just said. They were in shock, they were petrified.\nThey had to be. And knowing my mother was Jewish and denied it, and she wasn\u2019t\nwearing \u2014 fortunately they didn\u2019t say anything, and obviously they were fond of her,\nand I \u2014 I \u2014 I think they were just frozen in space. From there on, as I say, my gram \u2014\nthe only thing \u2014 I remember my grandmother, but yet I don\u2019t, but I remember she\ncovered both our heads, and I \u2014 we cou \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even breathe, I remember, and I\ndidn\u2019t want to.",

        "A: \u2014 but that\u2019s something I will never forge \u2014 I'll never forget. That was the worst\nthing I\u2019ve even seen in my life. I couldn\u2019t believe a human being could do\nsomething like that to another human being. But that was the beginning of many\nhorrors that I saw that I never should have seen, which is why I\u2019m here. It \u2014 1t never\nshould have happened, that people can do this to people.

        "Q: So, after this, do you have like a blank? I \u2014 do you remember going back in the\nhouse, do you remember \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: I do remember going back in the house, but I don\u2019t remember what was said.\nThere was a lot of mumbling among my mother and my \u2014 my \u2014 my grandmother,\nwho apparently \u2014 I don\u2019t know if \u2014 I can\u2019t even tell you if grandma was killed when\nthe bombs came, because shortly after that, I remember we were sleeping, and there\nwas like a\u2014 a-\u2014a- like a rubber thing li-like \u2014 like an earthquake. And I remember\n\u2014 it still \u2014 it was a joke in the family that my mother said, what\u2019s happening? My\nfather said, it\u2019s tun(ph) pasheening(ph). In Romanian that means it\u2019s a tank on\nrubber wheels. And she said, no, no, 1t doesn\u2019t sound like that, it sounds like, you\nknow \u2014 then we looked out and all of a sudden it was like Fourth of July, and it was\njust \u2014 1t wa \u2014 like firecrackers were going off. And I remember they tried to grab,\nand it just happened so quick. They \u2014 my mother grabbed my brother and my father,\nmyself and we ran. And as we ran, it was in the courtyard, and like, the courtyard\nwas gone. It was just \u2014 bombs were \u2014 were falling all over, and I don\u2019t know if \u2014 in\nEurope the \u2014 the Russians wear these fur skwerta(ph), th-the fur coats. Somehow\nor other she had that. Well, she \u2014 all I remember, we were running a \u2014 out of the\ncourtyard, and as we\u2019re running, I guess the force of the bombs lifted me up because\nI was th \u2014 to the point they had to drag me down and somehow or other we managed\nto go against this, I don\u2019t know if it was a\u2014a wood wall or a stone wall, and I\nremember thinking, we\u2019re gonna be hit, I don\u2019t \u2014 these things, there\u2019s fire, the whole\nOctober 15, 2009\ncourtyard, and our house was blown up, there was nothing to \u2014 the clothes on our\nbodies is all we had, and \u2014",

And\nthe bombs were going up. My mother kept on saying, pray to Grandma. So\napparently Grandma must have \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she was alive or dead. And we ran,\nand in running, my parents were saying don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look, but there were just\nbodies all over the place. And we ran, and I do remember this, we ran to a hospital,\nthat\u2019s the only other part I remember. And at that time, I don\u2019t know I \u2014 if it was\nRussians or what, but we \u2014 we were sitting on these benches type of thing against\nthe wall and wa \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 all I remember is my father stood up to, I think it was a\nRussian, they wanted the watches and the jewelry, and they\u2019re women. And my\nfather was very upset. I remember I never saw him this upset, I remember I never\nsaw him this upset and this frightened. I can\u2019t \u2014 I blacked out what happened after\nthat, but the part I do know, from that hospital, how we got out of there, I don\u2019t\nknow.

        "Q: So the \u2014 some of the bodies could have been of your relatives.",
        "A: Could have been. All I know is we ran on foot, and as young as I was, and it \u2014\nthere was total blank. Everything \u2014 my other cousins \u2014 and it turned out they \u2014 some\ndid survive.",
        "Q: Do you remember what time of year it was when all of that happened in the\ncourtyard?",

        "A: And by the time we got to Bucharest, it was warm. It was warm. So we ran \u2014",
        "Q: So it was several months?",
        "A: Oh, we ran, yeah. We \u2014 we hid in forests and I \u2014 I \u2014 all I \u2014 the part after the\nbombing and the \u2014 the hospital 1s \u2014 I remember that. After that, I remember, it\u2019s like\nwaking up and being in Bucharest. I know was warm because I remember all I had\nwas like a slip, and so it had to be warm. I just remember slight pictures. And I\nremember my dad was working, he had a factory and he was working making clo \u2014\ncoats and stuff. My mom worked with him. We were basically on our own, my\nbrother and myself, but that\u2019s the way you were brought up, and we stayed within\nthe courtyard. And I remember my father saying he couldn\u2019t do this. He\u2019s making\nOctober 15, 2009\ncoats for people who are killing and killed our relatives, and the other picture that I\ndo remember in Bucharest is my brother \u2014 my brother and I were going somewhere,\nI don\u2019t know where it was, a movie, or I don\u2019t even know. He was to take care of\nme, that was his responsibility.",
        "Q: For a little boy.",
        "A: No matter for \u2014 yeah, he was two years older, so whether I\u2019m six now, I don\u2019t\nknow. But I remember some street, and I know this was Bucharest, there was this\nman who was like stretched out with a stick in his stomach and he was opened up,\nand it said, this is what happens to Jews. And there were flies all over him. And my\nbrother took my face like don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look, and I remember thinking, I saw\nsomething like this. [aside: No, no. Somebody wants to see?] I saw something like\nthis with the woman, and here was this ugly picture. That\u2019s all I remember. That \u2014\nand somehow or other, back came the yellow bands, and from then on, all I\nremember is running. War broke out, running. And my next memory is, we\u2019re\nsomehow or other ca \u2014 we\u2019re like 1n trenches, in \u2014 in these trenches, my mother and\nmy father and my brother. Somehow or other we got caught. Exactly how we got, I\ndon\u2019t know, but then we were put, and we were well off and all, we were put in this\ncattle type of boxcart, and they were \u2014 it seemed like a hundred people just \u2014 we\ncouldn\u2019t breathe. It was dirty, it was th \u2014 and everybody was like \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nOctober 15, 2009\nlike in shock. And I \u2014 I\u2014 as young as I was, I couldn\u2019t understand why are we on\nhere with these people? We don\u2019t belong here. And people were crying, there were\nbabies crying, people were defecating and 1\u2014 we were just mobbed together. And\nwe figured, you know, a lot of people were crying, saying we\u2019re gonna be killed,\nwe\u2019re gonna be killed. Everybody had the yellow star on their arms. And then, all of\na sudden the boxcar must have dis-attached, because we were moving fast, like the\ntrain were just move \u2014 real fast. And suddenly, everything stood still, and we \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t see out because there was a bok \u2014 there were no windows.",
        "Q: So you were locked in this dark space \u2014",
        "A: We were locked in this dark space, and we had no idea what was 1n there except\na lot of people crying, yelling, what have you. My m \u2014 again, now I\u2019m, my mother,\nmy brother, my father, and I don\u2019t even remember where, it was just fear. And in my\nmind I thought we were just going to go on a trip, but why all these people? Cause I\nwas so young. But then when it got dis-attached, when the boxcar became dis-\nattached, everybody stopped, and you know, they couldn\u2019t open the door, and the\nmen, somehow or other managed to open the door, and we saw the rest of the\nboxcar, with probably more people, go on, and I was le \u2014 we were left on the track.\nSo the men, some ar \u2014 I gathered the men, the people in there opened it up, and\neveryone just scattered out. Families just ran every which way. And I remember we\nOctober 15, 2009\nnever left my mother and my father, we weren\u2019t allowed to, we just had to stick like\nglue. And we ran and we ran and we got into \u2014 and this was cute, I was telling my\nhusband, we crossed \u2014 what they used to do 1s they used to take a wad of money and\nwrap it around an explosive. When you\u2019ve picked up the money the explosive goes\noff, but being at the age that I was, we ran over \u2014 this I remember definitely \u2014 this\nlittle bridge, and I saw there was a wad of money. And I went for it, and my\nmother\u2019s going no, no, no, no, no. She really thought I was gonna explode any\nminute. Well it turned out it really was \u2014",
        "Q: A wad of money.",
        "A: \u2014a wad of money. And that wad of money crossed us \u2014 we were no \u2014 we ran by\nfoot, or from this boxcar, wherever we were \u2014 it took us. I remember it was in\nBudapest. And we stayed in this very \u2014 it \u2014 it looked like a great big \u2014 I remember it\nhad a white picket fence, and it was like a colonial type of beautiful house. And this\nis gonna sound very strange, it\u2019s like in\u2014 I\u2019ve been there before. And we were in the\ncellar, and what you do 1s \u2014 these were, I think Jewish people who crossed you over\nthe border. They took your rings if you had no money. They took money, well I had\nthe money, and my mother had rings, or I guess she had jewelry she had hidden, I\nhave no idea. But I remember we were to leave, and my mother told my brother and\nOctober 15, 2009\nI that I was a rotten kid, because I decided I\u2019d been here before and I \u2014 I\u2019m gonna go\nupstairs \u2014",
        "Q: Investigate.",
        "A: \u2014 because I haven\u2019t seen the daylight. And I wandered out, and I knew exactly.\nAnd I \u2014 how I remember this 1s my parents a \u2014 even told me. I knew exactly. If\nthere\u2019s such a thing as d\u00e9ja vu, this was \u2014 I knew exactly where I was. And I walked\naround the block and I knew where I was, no one can tell me otherwise. I knew\nwhere I was. And the man who was supposed to cross us over, not borders, to\nanother place, into the woods, and in the woods somebody else would meet us. And\nif you have more money, you give them and take you to another destination, that I\nremember. Well, they \u2014 my mother and father didn\u2019t want to leave because I was\ngone. Fortunately, I found \u2014 I knew where I was, I found my way back, got a heck of\na whack on my rear end, and we ran. And I was just telling my husband that the\nwoods were so thick, that now I \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m amazed why there were no animals, but\nthat\u2019s where we stayed, what \u2014 there was no food, we weren\u2019t given food. You pay\nthe money to the person who takes you to that part of the woods and you hide there,\nand from there someone, at dusk or nighttime, I can\u2019t even remember that part, takes\nus and leads us to another destination, and you hide in that wood, and \u2014 1n the\nwoods. And the woods was, you couldn't see. How \u2014 I remember being so young,\nOctober 15, 2009\nthinking how are they gonna find us? I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s all dark in the woods. But\napparently we made our way all the way to another place, where somebody reported\nUS.",
        "Q: In Hungary now.",
        "A: In Hungary. And there, we\u2019re put in jail. And for the first time \u2014 one minute \u2014\nfirst ttme my mother and I, and my brother and my father were separated. The men\nhad to go in one, it\u2019s like a courtyard. I remember it had like a fountain in front, and\nthere were women and the women had babies, and they were trying to feed the\nbabies. People would \u2014 the women were defecating, and I never s \u2014 I would never\nsee my father or my brother again, so we figured this is it. We were caught. We got\nthis far, we\u2019ll never survive again. But again luck was on our side, somehow or\nother. The door \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we were there a day, definitely overnight \u2014 they\npushed water and stale bread on \u2014 under the door. And if you got to it, you got to\neat, if you didn\u2019t, fine. But somehow or other the door was left open, this one, was it\nnight or dusk, I don\u2019t remember. I do remember my mother grabbing my hand, and\nwe ran, along with the other people. And we hid out, was like a farm, and there were\n\u2014I don\u2019t know what you call, but they were like a stable, and there was hay. And I\ndon\u2019t even \u2014 I can\u2019t remember how, but I remember they put tape on our mouth, and\nwe were told don\u2019t a\u2014 don\u2019t breathe. So, some \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s mouth too, or just children\u2019s?",
        "A: The kids, the kids, and we were not to sneeze, cough, nothing. And the part that I\nremember, which is almost comical, and I was thinking \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know my\nfather and my brother were also let out. Somebody left the door open, I think it was\ndone deliberately. What happened is we were in hay, covered with hay, and I\nremember my mother saying, not a word, don\u2019t move. Whispering, don\u2019t move,\ndon\u2019t cough, don\u2019t breathe, nothing. Well, all I can remember thinking is, I looked\ndown and I saw these gorgeous blue eyes. It was a German. It was a German man.\nBlonde hair, these piercing blue eyes, and he had a pitchfork. And I\u2019m thinking to\nmyself, if he\u2019s going to take that and push it in, how is my mother gonna know that\nI\u2019m gonna be killed and I\u2019m hurting. And I\u2019m \u2014I couldn\u2019t imagine, how do I let her\nknow, how do I let my mother know that he\u2019s gonna do that. He saw me. We made\neye contact, there\u2019s no question about that. And I thought, this is it, he\u2019s gonna do\nthat, my mother won\u2019t know. The blood will \u2014 these crazy things \u2014",
        "Q: Well, they\u2019re normal, they\u2019re logical for a child. You\u2019ve been told not to breathe,\nnot to talk, and this \u2014",
        "A: Well, and I remember somebody yelled du Juden? Are there Jews there? And he\nsaid, nein, nein, nostu(ph) kein Juden. But he was looking right at me. And I\nOctober 15, 2009\nthought, oh God, God, maybe he won\u2019t do it. After that, I remember they took the\ntape off and the running started. Now we ran from \u2014",
        "Q: We \u2014 I \u2014 wa - was your father and brother also in that hay?",
        "A: Yeah, but we didn\u2019t know that. We \u2014",
        "Q: So when you \u2014",
        "A:\u2014my mother and I just ran and then she must have realized that I didn\u2019t know,\nbut I saw, and we had no time to acknowledge or hug, we all ran. And somehow or\nother there was four of us. There probably were a lot more, but everybody ran. The\nonly thing I remember after that, and we were very lucky, I have no complaints, 1s\nwe again hid. There were nobody to cross the borders, whether we got \u2014 I think we\nran by foot, that becomes blank. I remember cold. All we had was \u2014 bathing, there\nwas no such thing. Food, I don\u2019t know how and what my mother gave me, or even if\nwe ate. That wasn\u2019t even important. Survival was the only important thing. And\nagain hiding, and being quiet. It was like I'll never talk again. Pll never see my\nfamily again. It \u2014 it was just, this is my way of life, this is how I have to \u2014 we have\nto live. And my brother wouldn\u2019t even talk to me, he \u2014 there was no talking, it was\njust surviving. Save your strength, survive. And we hid out, I believe, in fields. We\ngot, somehow or other my next memory 1s ot \u2014 in Salzburg, Austria. And we were\nlike, hiding in a field, but I remember seeing this \u2014 I assume it was a German \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009\nAustrian lady, was in her garden, and I remember she was pulling up carrots or some\n\u2014 and she deliberately took them and threw them like behind her, like here they are;\nhere Jew, eat; which was wonderful. So we had \u2014 and my \u2014 my next memory was in\nBeth Bialik, that\u2019s the displaced persons camp. How we got there, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But you were still together as a family?",
        "A: We were still together, we \u2014 we ran together everywhere.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a miracle.",
        "A: It was a miracle, and we are very lucky, because we should have been \u2014 we were\ngoing to either Auschwitz or Dachau, or \u2014 half of the people that didn\u2019t survive.\nOnly I think two people sur \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t mean to s \u2014 to suggest it was easy, I\u2019m just saying it was \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no, no \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 it was simply that, oh my gosh, that the \u2014",
        "A: We survived.",
        "Q: \u2014 that mother and father were there \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but we never \u2014 we were never \u2014 actually, when we got to Beth Bialik, was\nthe name of the d\u2014 displaced persons camp.",
        "Q: Was it in Austria?",
        "A: It was in Austria.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was in Austria. How we got there \u2014",
        "Q: And so now the war is over?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know if it was over, because now the quota was open. We couldn\u2019t go\nto Isra \u2014 we stayed back up \u2014 we were in this displaced people\u2019s camp, and there\nwere people from Russia, people from ru \u2014 each one was a group. The Romanians,\nwe were like in \u2014 I would say the size of this room. There was like a great big, I\ndon\u2019t know what you call them, like cabins, long \u2014",
        "Q: Barracks.",
        "A: Barracks, exactly. And each family had like a bed, and if you had two or three\nkids, the kids slept in one bed, and the mother and father slept in \u2014 but could have\nbeen five, six, eight, 10 families in these bar \u2014 one on one side, hi \u2014 and a curtain on\none side, a m-material curtain blocking at night and another. My father, for it\u2019s \u2014\nhow, I don\u2019t know, because he wasn\u2019t a violent man, but he came that \u2014 became that,\nis he was in charge of the Romanians, another man was in charge of the Polish,\nanother one the Lithuanians and Russians. And somehow or other I remember\nalways sleeping with my brother. I do remember having lice in my hair from the\nsweating, what have you. But I remember the one thing which was always awful, 1s\nif anyone in that camp was caught stealing, or doing anything against the other one,\nOctober 15, 2009\nthey would be punished. My father, the \u2014 my gentle father was the head of the\nRussians, and I do remember this and to this day I will not sleep with my back to a\ndoor, is I happened to peek out and I saw this man walking on the ledge up a \u2014 and I\nwas the only one, I saw his face, but we never \u2014 anyway, they caught him. My father\nhad to punish him to show the rest. Children, everybody had to watch. And I\nthought, he can\u2019t do this. I remember he took the man\u2019s hand and put it in the door\nand crushed his fingers. And that was so unlike him, he was not a es \u2014 he was not a\nbad man, but I thought, my father, look what it\u2019s done to him. He actually hurt this\nman, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the screaming that he broke his fingers.",
        "Q: Was he there to steal, was that what they was doing?",
        "A: He was watch \u2014 walking along the ledge, and, like there, and looking to where \u2014\nand I guess he stole some stuff. To this day I ne \u2014 I would \u2014 I \u2014I saw his face, he \u2014\nhe must have seen me, and I put the blanket over my head, that\u2019s just another\nmemory of mine. And I \u2014 I \u2014 he \u2014 he was found out, I don\u2019t know how, they found\nthe stuff on him. But I remember thinking I could never love my father like I used\nto. How could he do this to another human being? So I was convinced this \u2014 it did\nchange my father, it did change my mother. And from there on, the quota \u2014 oh I, we\nalmost \u2014 the quota opened up, we couldn\u2019t go to Israel because the British wouldn\u2019t\nallow us in, and he was just a tailor. They took the doctors, the lawyers to the U.S.\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd they had dozens of tailors, that was the \u2014 the most common profession. Even\nthough he was a designer, it didn\u2019t matter, that was his trade. And ironically enough,\nI \u2014 somehow or other, we were playing spin \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I sat on the bottom of a\nbottle, and I still got the scar. And my parents were horrified because there was a\nchance we could go and \u2014 not to the U.S., but Canada. And there were \u2014 there was\nno penicillin and if it was infected, and I remember my mother trying to hide, cause\nit was in the bone, it was right in the knee. How we found out, my brother says, why\nis the grass around you red? And then when I stood up, my whole leg on my left\nknee was cut. And instead of \u2014 I didn't understand what was happening to my\nparents, instead of, oh my God, are you all right, 1t was, we\u2019ll never get out of here\nnow. Our chances of getting out of here \u2014 and I thought, oh my God, I \u2014 they \u2014\nthey\u2019re not gonna allow my parents to get out of there because of me and I \u2014 what do\nI do? And somehow or other she camouflaged it, I don\u2019t know how. And we did,\nand my next memory 1s, I guess there were an X amount of people, some went. If\nyou had family in the U.S. and they were willing to take you in, and you were clean,\nat \u2014 as my pictures show, and you had to make sure that you were healthy, and they\nwere petrified that they\u2019re gonna find that I have this cut on \u2014 bad cut on my knee.\nAnd we were allowed to go \u2014",
        "Q: To the U.S.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 no, to Toronto, Canada was the only one. We had family in New York,\nbut sadly enough, the one in New York didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 somehow or other didn\u2019t\nwant to help, or whatever. We ended up in Toronto, Canada. That wasn\u2019t pretty \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have family there?",
        "A: No. That wasn\u2019t pretty either. The Jewish Federation helped bring you over. And\nwhen we got to Toronto, Canada, my mother \u2014 well, w-with \u2014 the boat was\nhorrible, because I remember everybody \u2014 I remember my father was so sick. We\nwere a great \u2014 the name of the ship was Samaria and the ship has since, I guess,\ngone under. But I remember we were, the DP people who were transported\nToronto, Canada, we were at the bottom where, you know, they put the coals and\nall, but we were grateful. We were getting out of Germany, and they, you know,\nwhen you go to America or Canada \u2014",
        "Q: Austria.",
        "A: \u2014 or au\u2014 you\u2019re gonna live. So it didn\u2019t matter if a rat ran over you or what have\nyou, and there was, whatever they didn\u2019t eat upstairs they throw downstairs. But it \u2014\nwhat I do remember is how green and horrible and sick my mother was. And I really\nthought she was gonna die, my mother was gonna die, because it was just \u2014 1t was\njust inhuman. But we made it, and from there we \u2014 it was still not pretty, we got to\nToronto, Canada and we actually stayed in \u2014 on Kensington Street. I remember\nOctober 15, 2009\nhow awful that was, because it\u2019s the only place that \u2014 the Jewish Federation gave us\nclothing, and I said \u2014 I \u2014 I found out I \u2014 gave us clothing, gave us shelter. We ended\nup staying th-the \u2014 the front of the house was where they \u2014 they killed the chickens,\nkosher chickens and there was blood, and I thought, oh God. And it was a Jewish\nschool, and I remember it \u2014 I forgot their names. It was an older lady and a\nwonderful couple. And all they could offer us was during the day \u2014 it was a Hebrew\nschool \u2014 we could sleep there at night, but we had to vacate, and all they could offer\nwas the floor. We were grateful, and that I remember, the four of us slept on the\nfloor at this Hebrew school at night, but during the day we had to vacate it. And I\nremember the smell of the chickens and the blood from the chickens, thinking to\nmyself, we really didn\u2019t survive. Those chickens, I \u2014 as a child I remember thinking,\nthis is what the Germans were doing, and they\u2019re doing this to chickens. Well, from\nthere we moved \u2014",
        "Q: Can \u2014 can I stop a little bit here?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Want to go back to a couple of \u2014 couple of things.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Two question \u2014 no, no, no, you\u2019re doing fine. I know it\u2019s hard. I know it\u2019s hard.\nYou talked about how you saw your parents change.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you have a sense of yourself as a child, and how you changed?",
        "A: How I changed? My parents changed, because I remember my mother \u2014 my\nfather was a designer and we were wealthy. My mother, in a way, was spoiled,\nbecause there was always money there. And suddenly \u2014 now that you bring that up,\nthe only job they \u2014 we had to pay back Jewish Federation, and I remember hearing\nmy mother saying \u2014 you know, I know now that all these donations that we give to\nthe Jewish Federation, maybe it\u2019s different now, and they worked \u2014 they were able\nto work in the delicatessen store. My father never did cold cuts, ne \u2014 my mother\nnever really worked, other than tailoring. And oh how he hated it. It was not his\ntrade. And then it actually became comical, because the little bit they made, half of\nhis salary, say if he got 10 dollars, five had to go back to the Jewish Federation. We\nknow for a fact the clothes were donations. And I\u2019m not putting down the Jewish fe\n\u2014 but every single paycheck, they had to pay back. And we wore hand-me-down\nclothes. I do remember this wonderful, wonderful teacher, and we moved \u2014 we had\nSIX moves in one year, til they managed to save some money. And it was made\nknown that whatever we give you, and put you up, you will pay, and they did. But I\nremember finally going to school \u2014 and I knew how to speak eight languages. By\nOctober 15, 2009\nnow I\u2019m eight years old, but you \u2014 a child picks eight \u2014 I was able to speak\nRomanian \u2014 fluent Yiddish, Romanian, Yiddish, little bit of German.",
        "Q: Language at home, was it Yiddish?",
        "A: Oh, it was Yiddish \u2014 Romanian.",
        "Q: So, what \u2014 your earliest \u2014",
        "A: And then it became \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 memories was Romanian?",
        "A: Romanian, only Romanian. Being in DP camp, we learned Yiddish, because it\nwas the mutual language, and other dialects. But there were also Polish, so, you\nknow, it became [speaks foreign language]. You pick up. And then, a lot of the\nkids were Russian. They picked up Romanian, I picked up \u2014 and the advantage of\nthis 1s it opened up a lot of doors in my later life, because I was able to go to school\nand use those languages, so it did \u2014 oh \u2014",
        "Q: Well, a child\u2019s like a sponge when it comes to language.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And \u2014 but, we made our way with Mom and Dad, and we got to school,\nand when we got to school \u2014",
        "Q: Was this the first school you\u2019d got to?",
        "A: ?d\u2014T?d\u2014TI didn\u2019t mention one thing which I should have. The other way that\nway back I survived, my mother put me in parochial school.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: That was \u2014",
        "Q: And where?",
        "A: This was way back in Iasi, I forgot to say that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Cause I remember the nuns boc \u2014 he \u2014 with the f \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the rulers and \u2014 and\nthey found lice in my hair too, then. But that \u2014 that\u2019s just clicked in, I should have\nsaid it earlier.",
        "Q: So you must have been a kindergartner in parochial school. Did you learn any \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, but it didn\u2019t matter. If I was in parochial school I was safe, and I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Have to wear the yellow star.",
        "A: My mother, somehow or other \u2014 yeah, that just popped into \u2014 that\u2019s probably\nanother way I survived, or, you know, and I\u2019m sure my brother did, too. But I do\nremember that ruler coming down on my knuckles. But, back to present, they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 the question of how did you change.",
        "A: How did I change? I think I became \u2014 my brother always took care of me. There\nwere a lot of other things I probably didn\u2019t have, but he \u2014 1 \u2014 he \u2014 hi-his\nOctober 15, 2009\nresponsibility \u2014 death would have gotten to him unless he to \u2014 his job was to take\ncare of me. And he did as best as I could, but I remember getting into fights, which\nwas not my nature. But the kids, I guess, were making fun of \u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I could\nspeak all these other languages, and the teacher, of course, all loved me. Couldn\u2019t be\n\u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t know where to place me, because so much school was missed. And\nsomebody called me, I don\u2019t know if it was dirty Jew or something, and I-I just\njumped on her, oh, I \u2014 I wa \u2014 1-1t wa \u2014 just wasn\u2019t \u2014 the anger came out of me like an\nanimal, and I remember my brother peeling me off of this girl. And I remember\ngoing to the principal\u2019s office, or somebody. And they \u2014 I couldn\u2019t speak to them, I\ncouldn\u2019t tell them. And, the [indecipherable] came down, and he said, why did you\ndo it? And I remember yelling, I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m Jewish. And that\u2019s the only part I\nremember is, I\u2019m Jewish. But the girl didn\u2019t do 1t because I was Jewish, but I\ncouldn\u2019t understand why she was picking on me, and making fun and laughing. So\nthe answer, it did, it hardened me. And even though my brother was to look after\nme, I realized that it\u2019s time to look after myself, this 1s going to happen. And I\u2019Il just\nhave to fill my own shoes, because he\u2019s two years older, he\u2019s now in another grade,\nand this is life. This is life, and we\u2019re very lucky, and you know, I can\u2019t be his\nresponsibility and actually it started to take hold, and I made my own friends and\nlearned the language faster then, and skipped two, three grades. Fortunately, I guess\nOctober 15, 2009\nI had a brain because it start \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where to put me. They started off\nwith first grade, and then I think the last was third grade. And then fourth \u2014 by\nfourth grade, I remember by then I was speaking English, made my friends, gave my\nbrother a breathing room where he could go with his friends. But 1t made me bitter.\nBitter, not \u2014 definitely bitter against the Germans, which, they weren\u2019t \u2014 it made me\nvery \u2014 to this day I have no love, and you can\u2019t blame the whole, and I mean, I hate\nthe language. And ironically enough, even as I got a job in public health nursing and\nput myself through school, I used the German lan \u2014 I had to use the German\nlanguage to be in a clinic, to interpret to German refugees in Toronto, Canada, of\nwhat to do with their babies. And a couple of times, I literally messed up, and I\nknew I messed up, and I didn\u2019t even, God forgive me, resent it. I really didn't \u2014 I\ndidn't feel bad about \u2014 not that I told her the wrong thing, I just said to her, in \u2014 in\nGerman, can\u2019t understand, na \u2014 na [German] fa \u2014 you know, mixing Jewish with \u2014\nand they \u2014 it\u2019s like I\u2014 I guess my best way of inter \u2014 I mixed the ger \u2014 Jewish with\nthe German deliberately. I wanted them to know I\u2019m a Jew, and I\u2019m helping you\nspeak this language for your baby. What did you do for us? That\u2019s where I was\nwrong. But that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 I can actually say from there on, I feel very fortunate.",
        "Q: I want to stop again, I\u2019m sorry to do \u2014",
        "A: Sure.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: But you had mentioned earlier that something had happened to your mother, that\nshe had fallen downstairs. Ge \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what was this episode?",
        "A: That must have happened either after I was born \u2014 all I know 1s the Holocaust, or\nthe Germans were paying for the people that went through the Holocaust, and it was\nmaking retribution.",
        "Q: Retri \u2014 reparations.",
        "A: Right. And there were paintings and stuff, and what have you, which were either\nburnt, we had no idea. As I remember, her being interviewed, this is in Canada, to\ngo to New York, and my father, and to be interviewed so that if you are eligible for\nthis. And I remember she did, and my father did. My father, for some reason they\nsaid \u2014 and he was beaten up many times, I think, I can\u2019t remember, because they\nsaid he \u2014 he\u2019s mentally unbalanced, of what he\u2019s saying. My mother got some\nretribution.",
        "Q: Re-Reparations.",
        "A: Rep \u2014 yeah, I keep making [indecipherable]",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: But my father didn\u2019t. Whether it\u2019s possible he \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I \u2014I really don\u2019t\nknow why, because in all honesty, he suffered more. But I remember she did, and\nthe story went, which I was too young, is she was pregnant and she was thrown\nOctober 15, 2009\ndown the stairs and lost the baby. And of course, the other things that happened to\nus, with the running, the house was destroyed \u2014 excuse me \u2014 and she got some kind\nof, I guess, pension. Not for long, but she is \u2014 she was eligible, but I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand \u2014 then, we were told, both my brother and I, that we too. And this is my\nsecond marriage. And I did marry a Jewish gentleman who I met my first time, first\nyear out of nursing school, anyway, and was married to a Jewish man for 20 \u2014\nalmost 28 years, had my three beautiful daughters. And at the time I was living in\nConnecticut, and my brother \u2014 my mother and father moved to be with me, cause\nthey weren\u2019t getting along with my sister-in-law, but it doesn\u2019t matter, they wanted\nto be close. And that was fine, we brought them over. And she was getting some\nmoney wa \u2014 and I remember my brother said, you know, you gonna go. And my\nhusband said, go. And I says well, Ill give them a call. And I think I spoke to\nsomeone on the phone, if I remember correctly. This \u2014 we\u2019re going back, I would\nhave been married 50 years. And they said, you have to speak German and you have\nto go through all this. And I said, you know what? There\u2019s no money you can give\nme to bring back these memories, I don\u2019t want to go through it, not then. And my\nbrother, to this day, because Cara(ph) called him, and das \u2014 my husband 1s \u2014 we just\nwent to a Bar Mitzvah, and I said, Morris, how can you not remember? I\u2019m \u2014 he\nOctober 15, 2009\nand I are the only survivors, my mom and dad passed away. And he says, I don\u2019t\nwant to remember it, I don\u2019t even want to talk about it. Cause she did call him, and \u2014",
        "Q: And so he\u2019s never given his testimony to anybody?",
        "A: No, and he doesn\u2019t want to. And he probably remembers more than me, but he \u2014\nhe wants to forget it, he says, I don\u2019t want to remember it. And I \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to\npush it because I saw him welling up. And I\u2019m not \u2014 the reason I\u2019m doing 1s, I have\nthat gentleman, my husband to thank, cause I had these few pictures, and I do have\nmore at home, and I was treasuring them. And, ironically enough, to end the story,\nmy husband said to me, look, the pictures are gonna just crumble up and they\u2019re\ngonna get lost. Have them, you know, put them in the Holocaust, and you know. So\nI did, and I\u2019m glad I did, because ironically enough, then a letter came, and I wrote\nmy little story, and my granddaughter, which I\u2019m very proud to say, and that\u2019s the\nreason I\u2019m here, says, Grandma, can I use your paper and talk about your experience\nin that \u2014 the Holocaust? And I said absolutely, and she used that and got an A plus in\nher \u2014 and then I went to speak to 90 \u2014 90 kids, three classes of sixth graders, and my\ntwo grandchildren were there, all big-eyed, looking at me, proud as punch, and I\nthought, there is a reason. And I really thank my husband for this, because the story\nhas to be told, it did happen, and the kids should know. My \u2014 my grandson, who\nlives in Florida will be here December \u2014 no, April, he was chosen, he\u2019s very gifted.\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd when he pushes that button, and sees some of the pictures, the story will go on.\nI may not be here, but the story should be told.",

        "A: Sure, no, go ahead. No, no, I was just going to say is, if you ask, you\u2019re told. I\u2019ve\nlearned one thing, there\u2019s just so much you can tell a child.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there\u2019s certain things I \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want it to be gruesome. It\u2019s\npart of history, but I\u2019ve always said to them is Grandma, Grandpa, myself and\nMorris are so lucky, we never got \u2014 and I still feel that way, we never got to go to\nDachau. We have friends that their children were killed, and they did experiments\non them. I mean, there were a lot of people who my parents stayed close to, that\nwere horror stories. I says, we\u2019re alive, and the four of us were spared, that we have\n\u2014we\u2019re very fortunate. So that\u2019s where I let it go. If they ask more, I would have\ntold them more.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: Well, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a funny thing, because there are contradictory truths,\nyes? One could say that.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But look at what \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t suffer. That doesn\u2019t mean\nyou didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, it\u2019s changed me, but it\u2019s also made me stronger, where I can actually\nsay Americans, Canadians don\u2019t know. It happened.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was a horrible thing, and it does \u2014 you can either \u2014 it\u2019s like life, you either lay\ndown and let it take you over, or you get up, you brush yourself off and you go on,\nand how \u2014 I \u2014I chose to brush myself off. Not just there, after a bad marriage too \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: \u2014 but ye \u2014 this is life. And that\u2019s one of the things I \u2014 I will treasure, because I\nsaw it and it added to my life, and I think made me stronger.",
        "Q: I want to go back to your parents.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: We\u2019re back in \u2014 in Toronto, your father\u2019s working in \u2014 in the delicatessen, which\nis not his.",
        "A: When we first arrived.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: Yeah, when you first arrived. Did he \u2014 what happened with them, and did they\never change back to the parents you originally knew?",
        "A: No, no. My \u2014 my father and mother worked in the delicatessen til \u2014 they hated it,\nbut it was the only way \u2014 the only job. Eventually, he went back to his tailoring, and\nmy mother worked too, and that was one thing that bothered my dad, because she\nonly worked with him, and was able to go back into the tailoring and worked there\nand made a nice living at it. And after years of slowly, after all these moves, they\nbought a house \u2014",
        "Q: In Toronto.",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 in Toronto, Canada, and it was on Essex Street, and that\u2019s where I\nbecame a person. We had a house. We did rent the upstairs, we didn\u2019t have a\u2014a\npenny, but I actually \u2014 I went to grammar school during the day, made sure my\ngrades were done. It \u2014 1t was different in my time, that I told the kids. I had school to\ndo, nobody cared whether I went to school, got As, Bs or Fs. My job, unlike my\nbrother now, the story reversed, I was to cook, I was to clean. He was a boy, he\ncould do whatever. So I went to elementary school there, Essex, and had a job, I\nthink I was 11, and worked with my girlfriend Marcy\u2019s father\u2019s store after school.\nWent to work there, but before I could do that, I had to clean and do whatever, cook.\nMy mother bought me a little stool and I could mix the soup and what have you.\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd that was my responsibility, so the shoe reversed, my brother had the freedom,\nbut I became the housekeeper. And I kept my grades up, my teachers were\nwonderful. Learning was a wonderful thing for me, and working made me\nindependent, and bought my own bicycle, made friends and my father and mother\nstayed in Canada and we lived there. Then we upgraded.",
        "Q: Was it a warm family, even though they had changed?",
        "A: No, the marriage, no. They argued a lot, and was mostly money. It was not the\nsame people that I remembered, but I just figured the hardship \u2014 there was arguing,\narguing and it was mostly money. And we supposedly moved up to Shepherd\nAvenue because of me, so that th \u2014 you know, I would meet better people and get\nmarried, because at 16 they were convinced I was gonna be an old maid. And as it\nturned out, at 18, I was married.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Yeah, met my husband and at 18 I was married. At the age of 20 I had an ectopic\npregnancy, was told I couldn\u2019t have kids, but fortunately I did. And then \u2014 now I\u2019m\nin Connecticut and had my three beautiful daughters, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m jumping.\nAnd my parents came to live with us \u2014 with me. Well, not in my house, my \u2014 my n \u2014\nmy husband now in Connecticut, because we would go home, I would say every\nOctober 15, 2009\nthree, four months, because you\u2019re not allowed to re-enter, once you leave Canada,\nI didn\u2019t have dual \u2014",
        "Q: Citizenship.",
        "A: \u2014 citizenship. So we would go back, like in six months I could go back, and my\nparents were having a rough time there, because I was really the \u2014",
        "Q: Support.",
        "A: I was now the keeper.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I have been since the age of 12.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: You know, a lot of arguing, when you say changed, a lot of arguing. They loved\neach other deeply, but it was just a turbulence, a lot of turbulence.",
        "Q: It was too much for them.",
        "A: Too much for them, yeah, I think it got caught up, and even though slowly,\nslowly they made their way into, you know, my mother stopped working, my dad\nwas still working, they weren\u2019t happy. Then my brother got married, I was \u2014 moved\nto Connecticut. They were unhappy, so finally my husband said, let\u2019s bring them\nhere. And we did, and he opened up a little tailoring, cleaning and tailoring, did\nOctober 15, 2009\nextremely well. And I took care of them. And then, as time went on, my dad started\nto get Alzheimer\u2019s and things got \u2014 and I \u2014 I was the keeper, I \u2014",
        "Q: You kept it together.",
        "A: Every se \u2014 oh, yes, yes. My kids say you were the matriarchs, and I \u2014 yeah, yeah,\nI actually can\u2019t say that \u2014 my girlfriend always says my hands are like 90 year old.\nBut I did the cleaning, the cooking, what have you and I\u2019m \u2014 I b \u2014I didn\u2019t \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t really want to do this, I \u2014 I think she was \u2014 my mother was a bright woman,\nwho ha \u2014 probably never really should have had kids, being that she loved learning,\nshe loved business. And my father was more the caretaker. That\u2019s the best way I can\ndescribe it. And I was close, he was a wonderful man, I loved him deeply. Ended up\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s and could never be separated from my mother, he just adored her.\nAnd the saddest day, probably almost as sad as the Holocaust, is have to slowly take\nhis license away, and then put him in a home. Only because what was happening is\nhe would wander off. And I \u2014 now I\u2019m \u2014 I was separated from my husband, things\nwere tough. But my parents were my upkeep, and it got to the point where a\nwonderful visiting nurse says, you can\u2019t keep doing this, cause I had three kids to\ntake care of, and my parents. And the kids were easier to take care of than my\nparents. But it was difficult, because I think all of this took a toll on him. And the\nforgetting, but the wandering \u2014 wandering off, and we got him the bracelet, the LD.\nOctober 15, 2009\nbracelet and all. It \u2014 it got tough. Put him in the Jewish convalescent home, and\nMom had to go there too, because you couldn\u2019t separate them. And I watched him\ndeteriorate. That was hard. That was, I think the hard \u2014 one of \u2014 as hard as the\nHolocaust.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you know, you still loved him, even though \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I adored my dad.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2014I loved my mom, and I took care of my \u2014 as my husband knows, we were\nthere two \u2014 twice a week, three time \u2014 she was also in a Jewish home, and I da \u2014 she\ndied holding my hand.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Loved music. I can honestly say I took care of the both of them, thank God.\nThank God that \u2014",
        "Q: But what an ex \u2014",
        "A: It made me strong enough that I could do that.",
        "Q: But also, what an example for your girls.",
        "A: Oh, I hope to God they never have to do what I did. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve got long\nterm care so that they\u2019ll never have to go through what I \u2014 you know, that was hard.",
        "Q: It\u2019s tough.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: That\u2019s hard.",
        "Q: It\u2019s tough, it\u2019s tough.",
        "A: It \u2014 it was very tough. But \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 again, I \u2014",
        "Q: What years did they pass?",
        "A: My dad was in his 80s, and my mom, God bless her, was 93. 93, and I was able\nto give her an incredible 90\" birthday party \u2014 birthday party with [indecipherable]\nband, and as much money I could [inaudible]. And a \u2014 she may na \u2014 not have been\nthe greatest mom, but in my heart, I did what you can do, and I \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 would do it all over again. But \u2014 and I would not want my children to ever have\nto do that. It\u2019s too much of a responsibility.",
        "Q: Yes, but th-the values are \u2014 are the kinds you want your kids to see.",
        "A: Oh, you may \u2014 yeah, I loved her. I mean, I\u2019d have liked her \u2014 at times I loved\nthem.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And my dad, even though he was tough to live with, he was \u2014 he was a\nsweetheart. He was a sweetheart. There was nothing I couldn\u2019t ask my dad, and\nOctober 15, 2009\nmaybe not my mom. I loved my dad. He was tough to live with, but I loved my dad\nbecause \u2014 I'll add one thing, my mom didn\u2019t care what \u2014 the grades or what have\nyou, but that was because she \u2014 her mother had her at 50. It\u2019s a gap, so her mother\ntook care of us. But, when I graduated elementary school, I had to get, those days,\nlike a prom dress. And my mom said, just \u2014 my father said, Pll take you. It was\nprobably the ugliest dress in the whole prom, cause I was short and fat. And \u2014 but I\nwas just so proud that my dad, not my mom, went with me. So, we were close.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you ever know what happened to your grandmother, who was \u2014",
        "A: She \u2014 she died. I never would \u2014 was never explained to me, did she died during\nthe Holocaust. I remember \u2014 I don\u2019t remember a funeral, I don\u2019t remember. So, did\nshe die in the bombing? It was never brought up.",
        "Q: And the family, the con \u2014 family compound, was this your mother\u2019s family, or\nyour father \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It was your mother\u2019s?",
        "A: No, my mother\u2019s, my mother\u2019s.",
        "Q: It was family.",
        "A: My father\u2019s father was a farmer. Two of the most wonderful people. She was just\na tiny little thing. He \u2014 my father resembled, he was the gentlest man, the \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "Q: Your grandfather.",
        "A: \u2014 I think I\u2019ve only seen twice, as young as I was. And I know the whole farm was\nbig, and I remember him milking the cow and bringing it to me warm, out of \u2014 right\nout of the cow. But when the war broke out, either they were killed \u2014 I know my\nfather\u2019s sister, very tragically, there was a movie that was called, the brievela(ph) de\nMama. You understand what that means? Letter to your mother?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And apparently, some fire broke out, and she was trampled to death. And her\nname was Anutsa(ph). And my father told me this. It was just before, I guess, war\nfirst broke out. And that was tragic. Beyond that, I never really knew. I was too\nyoung. What happened to them, I don\u2019t know. His sister was alive in Israel, made it,\nbut when war broke out, every \u2014 everybody just flew in different direction.",
        "Q: Another question. How did you choose your profession? Where did you \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I had a few.",
        "Q: Yeah, then \u2014 you mentioned the nursing.",
        "A: Supposed to go to nursing school, but it didn\u2019t work out, because I couldn\u2019t stand\nanything being blood. And I was very good with my hands, and very athletic, as my\nmother was. She used to call herself a Maccabee, which she was in. I \u2014 I actually\nOctober 15, 2009\nhad a multitude of, after I got married, would bef \u2014 before I met my husband I\nworked for public health nurses. And \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. That would have been in Canada.",
        "A: That would have been in Canada. And I did volunteer work at a veteran\u2019s\nhospital up to the age that I got married. From about 15, myself and my friends\nwould go every Sunday and cook for the veterans. And I remember writing, they\nwere parachuters, and all that remained of them was just their bodies, they were like\nin \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you call those swings, you know, it\u2019s just the netting, it\u2019s like",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I remember they couldn\u2019t write. And I would write letters to their\nsweethearts, nobody came to visit them. They gave me tremendous \u2014 myself and my\nfriends, but I loved that. We \u2014 I \u2014I loved doing that.",
        "Q: It was meaning.",
        "A: It w \u20141t\u2014I don\u2019t \u2014I can\u2019t \u2014 I mean, at 16 you don\u2019t do things like that. There\nwere five of us, who we just stel \u2014 reunited in Toronto, Canada, and that\u2019s what we\ndid every Sunday. And it\u2019s \u2014 that \u2014 that was very fulfilling. That\u2019s the only way I\ncan describe it, very fulfilling, and back to your question as far \u2014 then I got married,\nand when I arrived in Connecticut I remembered all I could d-do \u2014 I was an\nOctober 15, 2009\nexcellent typist, so the thing to do was transcribe. And I applied to Manpower or\nsomething, and my typing was excellent. And ended up doing typing. And then my\nlanguages opened up doors again. My children were born and then I stopped\nworking, and my husband was in the printing business. And because of my\nlanguages, a friend called and says, Lili, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and\nGerman and a little bit of Russian and Polish. There\u2019s a job opening at the Jewish\ncenter for the hot lunch program that consists of like 150 people. You have to do\nprogramming, it\u2019s quite involved. I said, I don\u2019t know, because my husband didn\u2019t\nwant me to work. Went down, I applied, got the job, was able to take \u2014 I was not\nallowed to work unless I brought \u2014 til my kids were in school, home for the kids\nafter school, those were the rules. And that was fine. So I brought my little one,\nwhich is my youngest, Stacey with me, and I remember loving work, just loving it.\nPrior to that \u2014 oh, after that, I remember \u2014 I thought, okay, I did that, she came with\nme. Now it\u2019s time to put her in a daycare and I will put her in a daycare and get\nmyself a job. The other two were in school, and Ill work around the kids. And\nironically enough, I went to sign her up, and I was sitting on the floor, reading her a\nbook til I could get the director. And I had three or four kids on my lap, a couple on\nmy back, and I\u2019m reading these books and these kids are all over me, and I think,\nwhat the heck? And she says to me, would you \u2014 well, what\u2019d you come here for?\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd I says, to sign up my daughter. And she says, well, I\u2019ve got a better idea. You\ncome work for us. You see? So I ended up having a full time job, my daughter got in\nfree, and I started to work for the daycare. After that, I just loved working, and I end\n\u2014 from there, I went to work for special ed, as an aide. And because of my grades\nand what have you, I found myself working one on one, and I absolutely loved it.\nAnd I would go to different schools, and there was one, you know, some kids were\nwheelchair bound, couldn\u2019t talk, one was sign language. And I would work one on\none \u2014 one on one with them. That was another job. After that 1t was a multitude of\nincredible jobs, I don\u2019t know how I got them. Dad had to go, because now the kids\nwere all in school, and I thought, well, it\u2019s time to go on. I believe, if I\u2019m not\nmistaken, I worked for a bank. And that was again up to three o\u2019clock, and be home\nfor the kids. From the bank, I thought, well, let\u2019s see what else I can do, I love\npeople. I went to work for, happened to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy. I\nwas a wer \u2014 answered the phone. It\u2019s \u2014 and I ended up giving physical therapy,\nwhich I didn\u2019t want to do, but she says, you\u2019ve got some nursing background. I\nended up doing physical therapy, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. And then, next thing\nI know is this friend of theirs wanted to open up this thing, adaptive clothing for the\nhandicapped. And she had \u2014 that\u2019s when Velcro first came in.",
        "Q: Right.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: And she said, what do you think, Lili? So the one who owned the physical, she\nsays, I want you to meet this woman who came in, I think it was either Las Vegas,\nor I-I\u2019m not even sure where she lived, califor \u2014 someplace. She was a wonderful\nlady, we hit it off immediately. And she says, will you work with me on this, and\nwe\u2019 ll \u2014 somehow or other I got involved with her, and we opened up this thing. But,\nmy husband decided it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 that\u2019s enough. It was every eat \u2014 when I worked for\nthe Jewish Center, I was in the paper, because I was talking to governors and mayors\nand what have you. Whether that threatened him, I don\u2019t know, and I was in the\npaper, and then when I ope \u2014 started with this adaptive clothing for the handicapped,\nagain it was, you know, ribbon cutting, and that did it, it was just \u2014 ?m\u2014I\u2019m\nexposed, and there\u2019s just too much. So then, I think there was another job I was\napplying to, and that was \u2014 there were \u2014 I loved physical fitness and people, so I\napplied at, I remember, the YMCA in Hamden, Connecticut. And I thought,\nthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna get it, I mean, this 1s director for \u2014 and he says, I\u2019m very\ninterested. And I came home to tell my husband that I\u2019m going to possibly \u2014 you\nknow, I \u2014 I interviewed and there\u2019s a good chance, that was the end of my married\nlife, and what have you, and he says, no you\u2019re not, you\u2019re coming to work at Brody\nPrinting Company. If you\u2019re so great, you can prove it to me. And that was a bad\nmove, because I found the things \u2014 this was not the man I was married to, and\nOctober 15, 2009\nworking for him was not the things to do because the way he talked to people and\nhandled people is the way he hated other people handling him, not to get involved.\nAnd the marriage fell apart. And you ready? I was there with well, not three,\nbecause my daughter moved out, my oldest daughter, and she went to college, and\nso did the middle one. And the marriage \u2014 we went to Israel, my treat. The only way\nthe kids went on vacation 1s if I paid for it. And this was a wealthy man, who really\ndidn\u2019t like kids, but he wasn\u2019t a bad father, he just wasn\u2019t around, so I was basically\na single mom anyway. The reason I\u2019m saying this, and there is where the Holocaust,\nand my experience 1s making me what I am, I\u2019m grateful for. What does a woman\ndo with no credit cards, two children, three to take care of, had a beautiful home,\nwent on vacations, now I\u2019m alone, because the silence was deafening, the\nrelationship fell apart, and I kept on saying \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I go on vacations,\nI have a beautiful home, three beautiful children, what\u2019s going on, why am I\nunhappy? There was no conversation, it was \u2014 everything fell apart. There was no\ninteraction, and I was going into depression and I ended up div \u2014 taking the family,\nthe last hurrah, to Israel, where I met the cousin who split my head. And there were,\nI think, 12 of us at a table, and because my husband was well off at the time \u2014 and I\ntreated, with 7,000 dollars for that trip, and the best trip ever. And we got \u2014 the kids\ngot to see Israel. I met my \u2014 the family that was left over. And that \u2014 that was it,\nOctober 15, 2009\n1985, I went on my own. When we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst\nto me, there was somebody else for 15 years.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: That was \u2014 and back in the thing, I had to now, no credit cards, no car. What am I\ngonna do? Sold the house, which was mine, and went to school, and learned how to\nbe a court reporter. I worked in the court system.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: And that was \u2014 I became very independent, I made nice money, and thank you\nHolocaust for making me the strong woman.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And here I am. I was able to give a mar \u2014 up a marriage of almost 28 years, brush\nmyself off, start bu \u2014 all over again, and meet this wonderful man, who may not be\nthe same faith, but has taken over the Judaism and goes with me to synagogue, and\nthat\u2019s what comes from going through that.",
        "Q: It made you strong.",

And my dad was a tailor, but he was a designer, and we were quite\ncomfortably well off in Iasi. And I believe at the time that war broke out, which\nwas, I think I was four years old, and there was a lot of commotion out in the\nbackyard; meaning actually the front part of this courtyard where about four of our\nfamily, different families lived; which grandparents usually just buy a house and\nOctober 15, 2009\ncontinue to build so the family can stay together.

Iasi is a very small shtetl, which is like a little\ntown, and it was definitely in the farmer part, very rural. And my cousins, my\ngrandmother \u2014 my grandfather wasn\u2019t alive when I was born, and my grandmother\nlived in one of the houses, and I\u2019m not sure if one of the cousins lived with her.\nThen there were other cousins.

        "A: On the side there were farms, but we weren\u2019t into farming. I believe my\ngrandfather, who I never had a chance to meet, was a fisherman. Very well-to-do\nand very well acknowledged in the community, which my mother always told me he\nhad a great big monument that was dedicated to him. I never had the pleasure of\nmeeting him. We, I remember, lived in the front part, whether we were the last\nfamily, or my mother was yul \u2014 the youngest to get married, and I think she was,\nthat\u2019s where we lived, and my father, being a tailor, worked out of the house.",

Somebody wants to see?] I saw something like\nthis with the woman, and here was this ugly picture. That\u2019s all I remember. That \u2014\nand somehow or other, back came the yellow bands, and from then on, all I\nremember is running. War broke out, running. And my next memory is, we\u2019re\nsomehow or other ca \u2014 we\u2019re like 1n trenches, in \u2014 in these trenches, my mother and\nmy father and my brother. Somehow or other we got caught. Exactly how we got, I\ndon\u2019t know, but then we were put, and we were well off and all, we were put in this\ncattle type of boxcart, and they were \u2014 it seemed like a hundred people just \u2014 we\ncouldn\u2019t breathe.

And people were crying, there were\nbabies crying, people were defecating and 1\u2014 we were just mobbed together. And\nwe figured, you know, a lot of people were crying, saying we\u2019re gonna be killed,\nwe\u2019re gonna be killed. Everybody had the yellow star on their arms. And then, all of\na sudden the boxcar must have dis-attached, because we were moving fast, like the\ntrain were just move \u2014 real fast. And suddenly, everything stood still, and we \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t see out because there was a bok \u2014 there were no windows.",

And in my\nmind I thought we were just going to go on a trip, but why all these people? Cause I\nwas so young. But then when it got dis-attached, when the boxcar became dis-\nattached, everybody stopped, and you know, they couldn\u2019t open the door, and the\nmen, somehow or other managed to open the door, and we saw the rest of the\nboxcar, with probably more people, go on, and I was le \u2014 we were left on the track.\nSo the men, some ar \u2014 I gathered the men, the people in there opened it up, and\neveryone just scattered out. Families just ran every which way. And I remember we\nOctober 15, 2009\nnever left my mother and my father, we weren\u2019t allowed to, we just had to stick like\nglue. And we ran and we ran and we got into \u2014 and this was cute, I was telling my\nhusband, we crossed \u2014 what they used to do 1s they used to take a wad of money and\nwrap it around an explosive. When you\u2019ve picked up the money the explosive goes\noff, but being at the age that I was, we ran over \u2014 this I remember definitely \u2014 this\nlittle bridge, and I saw there was a wad of money. And I went for it, and my\nmother\u2019s going no, no, no, no, no. She really thought I was gonna explode any\nminute. Well it turned out it really was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014a wad of money. And that wad of money crossed us \u2014 we were no \u2014 we ran by\nfoot, or from this boxcar, wherever we were \u2014 it took us. I remember it was in\nBudapest. And we stayed in this very \u2014 it \u2014 it looked like a great big \u2014 I remember it\nhad a white picket fence, and it was like a colonial type of beautiful house. And this\nis gonna sound very strange, it\u2019s like in\u2014 I\u2019ve been there before. And we were in the\ncellar, and what you do 1s \u2014 these were, I think Jewish people who crossed you over\nthe border. They took your rings if you had no money. They took money, well I had\nthe money, and my mother had rings, or I guess she had jewelry she had hidden, I\nhave no idea. But I remember we were to leave, and my mother told my brother and\nOctober 15, 2009\nI that I was a rotten kid, because I decided I\u2019d been here before and I \u2014 I\u2019m gonna go\nupstairs \u2014",

If\nthere\u2019s such a thing as d\u00e9ja vu, this was \u2014 I knew exactly where I was. And I walked\naround the block and I knew where I was, no one can tell me otherwise. I knew\nwhere I was. And the man who was supposed to cross us over, not borders, to\nanother place, into the woods, and in the woods somebody else would meet us. And\nif you have more money, you give them and take you to another destination, that I\nremember. Well, they \u2014 my mother and father didn\u2019t want to leave because I was\ngone. Fortunately, I found \u2014 I knew where I was, I found my way back, got a heck of\na whack on my rear end, and we ran. And I was just telling my husband that the\nwoods were so thick, that now I \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m amazed why there were no animals, but\nthat\u2019s where we stayed, what \u2014 there was no food, we weren\u2019t given food. You pay\nthe money to the person who takes you to that part of the woods and you hide there,\nand from there someone, at dusk or nighttime, I can\u2019t even remember that part, takes\nus and leads us to another destination, and you hide in that wood, and \u2014 1n the\nwoods. And the woods was, you couldn't see. How \u2014 I remember being so young,\nOctober 15, 2009\nthinking how are they gonna find us? I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s all dark in the woods. But\napparently we made our way all the way to another place, where somebody reported\nUS.",
        "A: In Hungary. And there, we\u2019re put in jail. And for the first time \u2014 one minute \u2014\nfirst ttme my mother and I, and my brother and my father were separated. The men\nhad to go in one, it\u2019s like a courtyard. I remember it had like a fountain in front, and\nthere were women and the women had babies, and they were trying to feed the\nbabies. People would \u2014 the women were defecating, and I never s \u2014 I would never\nsee my father or my brother again, so we figured this is it. We were caught. We got\nthis far, we\u2019ll never survive again. But again luck was on our side, somehow or\nother. The door \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we were there a day, definitely overnight \u2014 they\npushed water and stale bread on \u2014 under the door. And if you got to it, you got to\neat, if you didn\u2019t, fine. But somehow or other the door was left open, this one, was it\nnight or dusk, I don\u2019t remember. I do remember my mother grabbing my hand, and\nwe ran, along with the other people. And we hid out, was like a farm, and there were\n\u2014I don\u2019t know what you call, but they were like a stable, and there was hay. And I\ndon\u2019t even \u2014 I can\u2019t remember how, but I remember they put tape on our mouth, and\nwe were told don\u2019t a\u2014 don\u2019t breathe. So, some \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: The kids, the kids, and we were not to sneeze, cough, nothing. And the part that I\nremember, which is almost comical, and I was thinking \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know my\nfather and my brother were also let out. Somebody left the door open, I think it was\ndone deliberately. What happened is we were in hay, covered with hay, and I\nremember my mother saying, not a word, don\u2019t move. Whispering, don\u2019t move,\ndon\u2019t cough, don\u2019t breathe, nothing. Well, all I can remember thinking is, I looked\ndown and I saw these gorgeous blue eyes. It was a German. It was a German man.\nBlonde hair, these piercing blue eyes, and he had a pitchfork. And I\u2019m thinking to\nmyself, if he\u2019s going to take that and push it in, how is my mother gonna know that\nI\u2019m gonna be killed and I\u2019m hurting. And I\u2019m \u2014I couldn\u2019t imagine, how do I let her\nknow, how do I let my mother know that he\u2019s gonna do that. He saw me. We made\neye contact, there\u2019s no question about that. And I thought, this is it, he\u2019s gonna do\nthat, my mother won\u2019t know. The blood will \u2014 these crazy things \u2014",
        "A: Well, and I remember somebody yelled du Juden? Are there Jews there? And he\nsaid, nein, nein, nostu(ph) kein Juden. But he was looking right at me. And I\nOctober 15, 2009\nthought, oh God, God, maybe he won\u2019t do it. After that, I remember they took the\ntape off and the running started. Now we ran from \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but we didn\u2019t know that. We \u2014",
        "A:\u2014my mother and I just ran and then she must have realized that I didn\u2019t know,\nbut I saw, and we had no time to acknowledge or hug, we all ran. And somehow or\nother there was four of us. There probably were a lot more, but everybody ran. The\nonly thing I remember after that, and we were very lucky, I have no complaints, 1s\nwe again hid. There were nobody to cross the borders, whether we got \u2014 I think we\nran by foot, that becomes blank. I remember cold. All we had was \u2014 bathing, there\nwas no such thing. Food, I don\u2019t know how and what my mother gave me, or even if\nwe ate. That wasn\u2019t even important. Survival was the only important thing. And\nagain hiding, and being quiet. It was like I'll never talk again. Pll never see my\nfamily again. It \u2014 it was just, this is my way of life, this is how I have to \u2014 we have\nto live. And my brother wouldn\u2019t even talk to me, he \u2014 there was no talking, it was\njust surviving. Save your strength, survive. And we hid out, I believe, in fields. We\ngot, somehow or other my next memory 1s ot \u2014 in Salzburg, Austria. And we were\nlike, hiding in a field, but I remember seeing this \u2014 I assume it was a German \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009\nAustrian lady, was in her garden, and I remember she was pulling up carrots or some\n\u2014 and she deliberately took them and threw them like behind her, like here they are;\nhere Jew, eat; which was wonderful. So we had \u2014 and my \u2014 my next memory was in\nBeth Bialik, that\u2019s the displaced persons camp. How we got there, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: We were still together, we \u2014 we ran together everywhere.",
        "A: It was a miracle, and we are very lucky, because we should have been \u2014 we were\ngoing to either Auschwitz or Dachau, or \u2014 half of the people that didn\u2019t survive.\nOnly I think two people sur \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no, no \u2014",
        "A: We survived.",
        "A: Yeah, but we never \u2014 we were never \u2014 actually, when we got to Beth Bialik, was\nthe name of the d\u2014 displaced persons camp.",
        "A: It was in Austria.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: It was in Austria. How we got there \u2014",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know if it was over, because now the quota was open. We couldn\u2019t go\nto Isra \u2014 we stayed back up \u2014 we were in this displaced people\u2019s camp, and there\nwere people from Russia, people from ru \u2014 each one was a group. The Romanians,\nwe were like in \u2014 I would say the size of this room. There was like a great big, I\ndon\u2019t know what you call them, like cabins, long \u2014",
        "A: Barracks, exactly. And each family had like a bed, and if you had two or three\nkids, the kids slept in one bed, and the mother and father slept in \u2014 but could have\nbeen five, six, eight, 10 families in these bar \u2014 one on one side, hi \u2014 and a curtain on\none side, a m-material curtain blocking at night and another. My father, for it\u2019s \u2014\nhow, I don\u2019t know, because he wasn\u2019t a violent man, but he came that \u2014 became that,\nis he was in charge of the Romanians, another man was in charge of the Polish,\nanother one the Lithuanians and Russians. And somehow or other I remember\nalways sleeping with my brother. I do remember having lice in my hair from the\nsweating, what have you. But I remember the one thing which was always awful, 1s\nif anyone in that camp was caught stealing, or doing anything against the other one,\nOctober 15, 2009\nthey would be punished. My father, the \u2014 my gentle father was the head of the\nRussians, and I do remember this and to this day I will not sleep with my back to a\ndoor, is I happened to peek out and I saw this man walking on the ledge up a \u2014 and I\nwas the only one, I saw his face, but we never \u2014 anyway, they caught him. My father\nhad to punish him to show the rest. Children, everybody had to watch. And I\nthought, he can\u2019t do this. I remember he took the man\u2019s hand and put it in the door\nand crushed his fingers. And that was so unlike him, he was not a es \u2014 he was not a\nbad man, but I thought, my father, look what it\u2019s done to him. He actually hurt this\nman, and the \u2014 the \u2014 the screaming that he broke his fingers.",
        "A: He was watch \u2014 walking along the ledge, and, like there, and looking to where \u2014\nand I guess he stole some stuff. To this day I ne \u2014 I would \u2014 I \u2014I saw his face, he \u2014\nhe must have seen me, and I put the blanket over my head, that\u2019s just another\nmemory of mine. And I \u2014 I \u2014 he \u2014 he was found out, I don\u2019t know how, they found\nthe stuff on him. But I remember thinking I could never love my father like I used\nto. How could he do this to another human being? So I was convinced this \u2014 it did\nchange my father, it did change my mother. And from there on, the quota \u2014 oh I, we\nalmost \u2014 the quota opened up, we couldn\u2019t go to Israel because the British wouldn\u2019t\nallow us in, and he was just a tailor. They took the doctors, the lawyers to the U.S.\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd they had dozens of tailors, that was the \u2014 the most common profession. Even\nthough he was a designer, it didn\u2019t matter, that was his trade. And ironically enough,\nI \u2014 somehow or other, we were playing spin \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I sat on the bottom of a\nbottle, and I still got the scar. And my parents were horrified because there was a\nchance we could go and \u2014 not to the U.S., but Canada. And there were \u2014 there was\nno penicillin and if it was infected, and I remember my mother trying to hide, cause\nit was in the bone, it was right in the knee. How we found out, my brother says, why\nis the grass around you red? And then when I stood up, my whole leg on my left\nknee was cut. And instead of \u2014 I didn't understand what was happening to my\nparents, instead of, oh my God, are you all right, 1t was, we\u2019ll never get out of here\nnow. Our chances of getting out of here \u2014 and I thought, oh my God, I \u2014 they \u2014\nthey\u2019re not gonna allow my parents to get out of there because of me and I \u2014 what do\nI do? And somehow or other she camouflaged it, I don\u2019t know how. And we did,\nand my next memory 1s, I guess there were an X amount of people, some went. If\nyou had family in the U.S. and they were willing to take you in, and you were clean,\nat \u2014 as my pictures show, and you had to make sure that you were healthy, and they\nwere petrified that they\u2019re gonna find that I have this cut on \u2014 bad cut on my knee.\nAnd we were allowed to go \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 no, to Toronto, Canada was the only one. We had family in New York,\nbut sadly enough, the one in New York didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 somehow or other didn\u2019t\nwant to help, or whatever. We ended up in Toronto, Canada. That wasn\u2019t pretty \u2014",
        "A: No. That wasn\u2019t pretty either. The Jewish Federation helped bring you over. And\nwhen we got to Toronto, Canada, my mother \u2014 well, w-with \u2014 the boat was\nhorrible, because I remember everybody \u2014 I remember my father was so sick. We\nwere a great \u2014 the name of the ship was Samaria and the ship has since, I guess,\ngone under. But I remember we were, the DP people who were transported\nToronto, Canada, we were at the bottom where, you know, they put the coals and\nall, but we were grateful. We were getting out of Germany, and they, you know,\nwhen you go to America or Canada \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or au\u2014 you\u2019re gonna live. So it didn\u2019t matter if a rat ran over you or what have\nyou, and there was, whatever they didn\u2019t eat upstairs they throw downstairs. But it \u2014\nwhat I do remember is how green and horrible and sick my mother was. And I really\nthought she was gonna die, my mother was gonna die, because it was just \u2014 1t was\njust inhuman. But we made it, and from there we \u2014 it was still not pretty, we got to\nToronto, Canada and we actually stayed in \u2014 on Kensington Street. I remember\nOctober 15, 2009\nhow awful that was, because it\u2019s the only place that \u2014 the Jewish Federation gave us\nclothing, and I said \u2014 I \u2014 I found out I \u2014 gave us clothing, gave us shelter. We ended\nup staying th-the \u2014 the front of the house was where they \u2014 they killed the chickens,\nkosher chickens and there was blood, and I thought, oh God. And it was a Jewish\nschool, and I remember it \u2014 I forgot their names. It was an older lady and a\nwonderful couple. And all they could offer us was during the day \u2014 it was a Hebrew\nschool \u2014 we could sleep there at night, but we had to vacate, and all they could offer\nwas the floor. We were grateful, and that I remember, the four of us slept on the\nfloor at this Hebrew school at night, but during the day we had to vacate it. And I\nremember the smell of the chickens and the blood from the chickens, thinking to\nmyself, we really didn\u2019t survive. Those chickens, I \u2014 as a child I remember thinking,\nthis is what the Germans were doing, and they\u2019re doing this to chickens. Well, from\nthere we moved \u2014",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: How I changed? My parents changed, because I remember my mother \u2014 my\nfather was a designer and we were wealthy. My mother, in a way, was spoiled,\nbecause there was always money there. And suddenly \u2014 now that you bring that up,\nthe only job they \u2014 we had to pay back Jewish Federation, and I remember hearing\nmy mother saying \u2014 you know, I know now that all these donations that we give to\nthe Jewish Federation, maybe it\u2019s different now, and they worked \u2014 they were able\nto work in the delicatessen store. My father never did cold cuts, ne \u2014 my mother\nnever really worked, other than tailoring. And oh how he hated it. It was not his\ntrade. And then it actually became comical, because the little bit they made, half of\nhis salary, say if he got 10 dollars, five had to go back to the Jewish Federation. We\nknow for a fact the clothes were donations. And I\u2019m not putting down the Jewish fe\n\u2014 but every single paycheck, they had to pay back. And we wore hand-me-down\nclothes. I do remember this wonderful, wonderful teacher, and we moved \u2014 we had\nSIX moves in one year, til they managed to save some money. And it was made\nknown that whatever we give you, and put you up, you will pay, and they did. But I\nremember finally going to school \u2014 and I knew how to speak eight languages. By\nOctober 15, 2009\nnow I\u2019m eight years old, but you \u2014 a child picks eight \u2014 I was able to speak\nRomanian \u2014 fluent Yiddish, Romanian, Yiddish, little bit of German.",
        "A: Oh, it was Yiddish \u2014 Romanian.",
        "A: And then it became \u2014",
        "A: Romanian, only Romanian. Being in DP camp, we learned Yiddish, because it\nwas the mutual language, and other dialects. But there were also Polish, so, you\nknow, it became [speaks foreign language]. You pick up. And then, a lot of the\nkids were Russian. They picked up Romanian, I picked up \u2014 and the advantage of\nthis 1s it opened up a lot of doors in my later life, because I was able to go to school\nand use those languages, so it did \u2014 oh \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes. And \u2014 but, we made our way with Mom and Dad, and we got to school,\nand when we got to school \u2014",
        "A: ?d\u2014T?d\u2014TI didn\u2019t mention one thing which I should have. The other way that\nway back I survived, my mother put me in parochial school.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: That was \u2014",
        "A: This was way back in Iasi, I forgot to say that.",
        "A: Cause I remember the nuns boc \u2014 he \u2014 with the f \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the rulers and \u2014 and\nthey found lice in my hair too, then. But that \u2014 that\u2019s just clicked in, I should have\nsaid it earlier.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, but it didn\u2019t matter. If I was in parochial school I was safe, and I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: My mother, somehow or other \u2014 yeah, that just popped into \u2014 that\u2019s probably\nanother way I survived, or, you know, and I\u2019m sure my brother did, too. But I do\nremember that ruler coming down on my knuckles. But, back to present, they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: How did I change? I think I became \u2014 my brother always took care of me. There\nwere a lot of other things I probably didn\u2019t have, but he \u2014 1 \u2014 he \u2014 hi-his\nOctober 15, 2009\nresponsibility \u2014 death would have gotten to him unless he to \u2014 his job was to take\ncare of me. And he did as best as I could, but I remember getting into fights, which\nwas not my nature. But the kids, I guess, were making fun of \u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I could\nspeak all these other languages, and the teacher, of course, all loved me. Couldn\u2019t be\n\u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t know where to place me, because so much school was missed. And\nsomebody called me, I don\u2019t know if it was dirty Jew or something, and I-I just\njumped on her, oh, I \u2014 I wa \u2014 1-1t wa \u2014 just wasn\u2019t \u2014 the anger came out of me like an\nanimal, and I remember my brother peeling me off of this girl. And I remember\ngoing to the principal\u2019s office, or somebody. And they \u2014 I couldn\u2019t speak to them, I\ncouldn\u2019t tell them. And, the [indecipherable] came down, and he said, why did you\ndo it? And I remember yelling, I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m Jewish. And that\u2019s the only part I\nremember is, I\u2019m Jewish. But the girl didn\u2019t do 1t because I was Jewish, but I\ncouldn\u2019t understand why she was picking on me, and making fun and laughing. So\nthe answer, it did, it hardened me. And even though my brother was to look after\nme, I realized that it\u2019s time to look after myself, this 1s going to happen. And I\u2019Il just\nhave to fill my own shoes, because he\u2019s two years older, he\u2019s now in another grade,\nand this is life. This is life, and we\u2019re very lucky, and you know, I can\u2019t be his\nresponsibility and actually it started to take hold, and I made my own friends and\nlearned the language faster then, and skipped two, three grades. Fortunately, I guess\nOctober 15, 2009\nI had a brain because it start \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where to put me. They started off\nwith first grade, and then I think the last was third grade. And then fourth \u2014 by\nfourth grade, I remember by then I was speaking English, made my friends, gave my\nbrother a breathing room where he could go with his friends. But 1t made me bitter.\nBitter, not \u2014 definitely bitter against the Germans, which, they weren\u2019t \u2014 it made me\nvery \u2014 to this day I have no love, and you can\u2019t blame the whole, and I mean, I hate\nthe language. And ironically enough, even as I got a job in public health nursing and\nput myself through school, I used the German lan \u2014 I had to use the German\nlanguage to be in a clinic, to interpret to German refugees in Toronto, Canada, of\nwhat to do with their babies. And a couple of times, I literally messed up, and I\nknew I messed up, and I didn\u2019t even, God forgive me, resent it. I really didn't \u2014 I\ndidn't feel bad about \u2014 not that I told her the wrong thing, I just said to her, in \u2014 in\nGerman, can\u2019t understand, na \u2014 na [German] fa \u2014 you know, mixing Jewish with \u2014\nand they \u2014 it\u2019s like I\u2014 I guess my best way of inter \u2014 I mixed the ger \u2014 Jewish with\nthe German deliberately. I wanted them to know I\u2019m a Jew, and I\u2019m helping you\nspeak this language for your baby. What did you do for us? That\u2019s where I was\nwrong. But that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 I can actually say from there on, I feel very fortunate.",
        "A: Sure.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: That must have happened either after I was born \u2014 all I know 1s the Holocaust, or\nthe Germans were paying for the people that went through the Holocaust, and it was\nmaking retribution.",
        "A: Right. And there were paintings and stuff, and what have you, which were either\nburnt, we had no idea. As I remember, her being interviewed, this is in Canada, to\ngo to New York, and my father, and to be interviewed so that if you are eligible for\nthis. And I remember she did, and my father did. My father, for some reason they\nsaid \u2014 and he was beaten up many times, I think, I can\u2019t remember, because they\nsaid he \u2014 he\u2019s mentally unbalanced, of what he\u2019s saying. My mother got some\nretribution.",
        "A: Rep \u2014 yeah, I keep making [indecipherable]",
        "A: But my father didn\u2019t. Whether it\u2019s possible he \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I \u2014I really don\u2019t\nknow why, because in all honesty, he suffered more. But I remember she did, and\nthe story went, which I was too young, is she was pregnant and she was thrown\nOctober 15, 2009\ndown the stairs and lost the baby. And of course, the other things that happened to\nus, with the running, the house was destroyed \u2014 excuse me \u2014 and she got some kind\nof, I guess, pension. Not for long, but she is \u2014 she was eligible, but I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand \u2014 then, we were told, both my brother and I, that we too. And this is my\nsecond marriage. And I did marry a Jewish gentleman who I met my first time, first\nyear out of nursing school, anyway, and was married to a Jewish man for 20 \u2014\nalmost 28 years, had my three beautiful daughters. And at the time I was living in\nConnecticut, and my brother \u2014 my mother and father moved to be with me, cause\nthey weren\u2019t getting along with my sister-in-law, but it doesn\u2019t matter, they wanted\nto be close. And that was fine, we brought them over. And she was getting some\nmoney wa \u2014 and I remember my brother said, you know, you gonna go. And my\nhusband said, go. And I says well, Ill give them a call. And I think I spoke to\nsomeone on the phone, if I remember correctly. This \u2014 we\u2019re going back, I would\nhave been married 50 years. And they said, you have to speak German and you have\nto go through all this. And I said, you know what? There\u2019s no money you can give\nme to bring back these memories, I don\u2019t want to go through it, not then. And my\nbrother, to this day, because Cara(ph) called him, and das \u2014 my husband 1s \u2014 we just\nwent to a Bar Mitzvah, and I said, Morris, how can you not remember? I\u2019m \u2014 he\nOctober 15, 2009\nand I are the only survivors, my mom and dad passed away. And he says, I don\u2019t\nwant to remember it, I don\u2019t even want to talk about it. Cause she did call him, and \u2014",
        "A: No, and he doesn\u2019t want to. And he probably remembers more than me, but he \u2014\nhe wants to forget it, he says, I don\u2019t want to remember it. And I \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to\npush it because I saw him welling up. And I\u2019m not \u2014 the reason I\u2019m doing 1s, I have\nthat gentleman, my husband to thank, cause I had these few pictures, and I do have\nmore at home, and I was treasuring them. And, ironically enough, to end the story,\nmy husband said to me, look, the pictures are gonna just crumble up and they\u2019re\ngonna get lost. Have them, you know, put them in the Holocaust, and you know. So\nI did, and I\u2019m glad I did, because ironically enough, then a letter came, and I wrote\nmy little story, and my granddaughter, which I\u2019m very proud to say, and that\u2019s the\nreason I\u2019m here, says, Grandma, can I use your paper and talk about your experience\nin that \u2014 the Holocaust? And I said absolutely, and she used that and got an A plus in\nher \u2014 and then I went to speak to 90 \u2014 90 kids, three classes of sixth graders, and my\ntwo grandchildren were there, all big-eyed, looking at me, proud as punch, and I\nthought, there is a reason. And I really thank my husband for this, because the story\nhas to be told, it did happen, and the kids should know. My \u2014 my grandson, who\nlives in Florida will be here December \u2014 no, April, he was chosen, he\u2019s very gifted.\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd when he pushes that button, and sees some of the pictures, the story will go on.\nI may not be here, but the story should be told.",

        "A: \u2014 it just \u2014 so, I think, gruesome. Very gruesome.",

        "A: He was an American Jew.",
        "A: And I guess the story goes, you know, you come to America, golden land, but\nwe worked for everything, nobody \u2014 my family had nothing to give us.",
        "A: But that\u2019s the wonderful part, we made it the hard way, and we\u2019re here. As far as\ntelling the kids, they know I was there.

Certain parts, that we were in DP camp and what\nhave you, it\u2019s like maybe they didn\u2019t want to put \u2014 it could be they didn't want to put\nme through telling this. But, when I told them, they were very, very excited that I am\ntelling the story. And as I said to my daughter, when you do go, and you really want\nto hear, because she\u2019s never heard, this is my middle daughter, press the button. Or\ngo see the archives.",
        "A: What happens to this?",
        "A: Uh-huh.\nOctober 15, 2009",

        "A: And that\u2019ll be the first time she will hear it.",
        "A: Well, you know, if \u2014",
        "A: Sure, no, go ahead. No, no, I was just going to say is, if you ask, you\u2019re told. I\u2019ve\nlearned one thing, there\u2019s just so much you can tell a child.",
        "A: And there\u2019s certain things I \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want it to be gruesome. It\u2019s\npart of history, but I\u2019ve always said to them is Grandma, Grandpa, myself and\nMorris are so lucky, we never got \u2014 and I still feel that way, we never got to go to\nDachau. We have friends that their children were killed, and they did experiments\non them. I mean, there were a lot of people who my parents stayed close to, that\nwere horror stories. I says, we\u2019re alive, and the four of us were spared, that we have\n\u2014we\u2019re very fortunate. So that\u2019s where I let it go. If they ask more, I would have\ntold them more.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it\u2019s changed me, but it\u2019s also made me stronger, where I can actually\nsay Americans, Canadians don\u2019t know. It happened.",
        "A: It was a horrible thing, and it does \u2014 you can either \u2014 it\u2019s like life, you either lay\ndown and let it take you over, or you get up, you brush yourself off and you go on,\nand how \u2014 I \u2014I chose to brush myself off. Not just there, after a bad marriage too \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but ye \u2014 this is life. And that\u2019s one of the things I \u2014 I will treasure, because I\nsaw it and it added to my life, and I think made me stronger.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: When we first arrived.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: No, no. My \u2014 my father and mother worked in the delicatessen til \u2014 they hated it,\nbut it was the only way \u2014 the only job. Eventually, he went back to his tailoring, and\nmy mother worked too, and that was one thing that bothered my dad, because she\nonly worked with him, and was able to go back into the tailoring and worked there\nand made a nice living at it. And after years of slowly, after all these moves, they\nbought a house \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 in Toronto, Canada, and it was on Essex Street, and that\u2019s where I\nbecame a person. We had a house. We did rent the upstairs, we didn\u2019t have a\u2014a\npenny, but I actually \u2014 I went to grammar school during the day, made sure my\ngrades were done. It \u2014 1t was different in my time, that I told the kids. I had school to\ndo, nobody cared whether I went to school, got As, Bs or Fs. My job, unlike my\nbrother now, the story reversed, I was to cook, I was to clean. He was a boy, he\ncould do whatever. So I went to elementary school there, Essex, and had a job, I\nthink I was 11, and worked with my girlfriend Marcy\u2019s father\u2019s store after school.\nWent to work there, but before I could do that, I had to clean and do whatever, cook.\nMy mother bought me a little stool and I could mix the soup and what have you.\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd that was my responsibility, so the shoe reversed, my brother had the freedom,\nbut I became the housekeeper. And I kept my grades up, my teachers were\nwonderful. Learning was a wonderful thing for me, and working made me\nindependent, and bought my own bicycle, made friends and my father and mother\nstayed in Canada and we lived there. Then we upgraded.",
        "A: No, the marriage, no. They argued a lot, and was mostly money. It was not the\nsame people that I remembered, but I just figured the hardship \u2014 there was arguing,\narguing and it was mostly money. And we supposedly moved up to Shepherd\nAvenue because of me, so that th \u2014 you know, I would meet better people and get\nmarried, because at 16 they were convinced I was gonna be an old maid. And as it\nturned out, at 18, I was married.",
        "A: Yeah, met my husband and at 18 I was married. At the age of 20 I had an ectopic\npregnancy, was told I couldn\u2019t have kids, but fortunately I did. And then \u2014 now I\u2019m\nin Connecticut and had my three beautiful daughters, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m jumping.\nAnd my parents came to live with us \u2014 with me. Well, not in my house, my \u2014 my n \u2014\nmy husband now in Connecticut, because we would go home, I would say every\nOctober 15, 2009\nthree, four months, because you\u2019re not allowed to re-enter, once you leave Canada,\nI didn\u2019t have dual \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 citizenship. So we would go back, like in six months I could go back, and my\nparents were having a rough time there, because I was really the \u2014",
        "A: I was now the keeper.",
        "A: And I have been since the age of 12.",
        "A: You know, a lot of arguing, when you say changed, a lot of arguing. They loved\neach other deeply, but it was just a turbulence, a lot of turbulence.",
        "A: Too much for them, yeah, I think it got caught up, and even though slowly,\nslowly they made their way into, you know, my mother stopped working, my dad\nwas still working, they weren\u2019t happy. Then my brother got married, I was \u2014 moved\nto Connecticut. They were unhappy, so finally my husband said, let\u2019s bring them\nhere. And we did, and he opened up a little tailoring, cleaning and tailoring, did\nOctober 15, 2009\nextremely well. And I took care of them. And then, as time went on, my dad started\nto get Alzheimer\u2019s and things got \u2014 and I \u2014 I was the keeper, I \u2014",
        "A: Every se \u2014 oh, yes, yes. My kids say you were the matriarchs, and I \u2014 yeah, yeah,\nI actually can\u2019t say that \u2014 my girlfriend always says my hands are like 90 year old.\nBut I did the cleaning, the cooking, what have you and I\u2019m \u2014 I b \u2014I didn\u2019t \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t really want to do this, I \u2014 I think she was \u2014 my mother was a bright woman,\nwho ha \u2014 probably never really should have had kids, being that she loved learning,\nshe loved business. And my father was more the caretaker. That\u2019s the best way I can\ndescribe it. And I was close, he was a wonderful man, I loved him deeply. Ended up\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s and could never be separated from my mother, he just adored her.\nAnd the saddest day, probably almost as sad as the Holocaust, is have to slowly take\nhis license away, and then put him in a home. Only because what was happening is\nhe would wander off. And I \u2014 now I\u2019m \u2014 I was separated from my husband, things\nwere tough. But my parents were my upkeep, and it got to the point where a\nwonderful visiting nurse says, you can\u2019t keep doing this, cause I had three kids to\ntake care of, and my parents. And the kids were easier to take care of than my\nparents. But it was difficult, because I think all of this took a toll on him. And the\nforgetting, but the wandering \u2014 wandering off, and we got him the bracelet, the LD.\nOctober 15, 2009\nbracelet and all. It \u2014 it got tough. Put him in the Jewish convalescent home, and\nMom had to go there too, because you couldn\u2019t separate them. And I watched him\ndeteriorate. That was hard. That was, I think the hard \u2014 one of \u2014 as hard as the\nHolocaust.",
        "A: Oh, I adored my dad.",
        "A: I\u2014I loved my mom, and I took care of my \u2014 as my husband knows, we were\nthere two \u2014 twice a week, three time \u2014 she was also in a Jewish home, and I da \u2014 she\ndied holding my hand.",
        "A: Loved music. I can honestly say I took care of the both of them, thank God.\nThank God that \u2014",
        "A: It made me strong enough that I could do that.",
        "A: Oh, I hope to God they never have to do what I did. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve got long\nterm care so that they\u2019ll never have to go through what I \u2014 you know, that was hard.",
        "A: That\u2019s hard.",
        "A: It \u2014 it was very tough. But \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 again, I \u2014",
        "A: My dad was in his 80s, and my mom, God bless her, was 93. 93, and I was able\nto give her an incredible 90\" birthday party \u2014 birthday party with [indecipherable]\nband, and as much money I could [inaudible]. And a \u2014 she may na \u2014 not have been\nthe greatest mom, but in my heart, I did what you can do, and I \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 would do it all over again. But \u2014 and I would not want my children to ever have\nto do that. It\u2019s too much of a responsibility.",
        "A: Oh, you may \u2014 yeah, I loved her. I mean, I\u2019d have liked her \u2014 at times I loved\nthem.",
        "A: And my dad, even though he was tough to live with, he was \u2014 he was a\nsweetheart. He was a sweetheart. There was nothing I couldn\u2019t ask my dad, and\nOctober 15, 2009\nmaybe not my mom. I loved my dad. He was tough to live with, but I loved my dad\nbecause \u2014 I'll add one thing, my mom didn\u2019t care what \u2014 the grades or what have\nyou, but that was because she \u2014 her mother had her at 50. It\u2019s a gap, so her mother\ntook care of us. But, when I graduated elementary school, I had to get, those days,\nlike a prom dress. And my mom said, just \u2014 my father said, Pll take you. It was\nprobably the ugliest dress in the whole prom, cause I was short and fat. And \u2014 but I\nwas just so proud that my dad, not my mom, went with me. So, we were close.",
        "A: She \u2014 she died. I never would \u2014 was never explained to me, did she died during\nthe Holocaust. I remember \u2014 I don\u2019t remember a funeral, I don\u2019t remember. So, did\nshe die in the bombing? It was never brought up.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, my mother\u2019s, my mother\u2019s.",
        "A: My father\u2019s father was a farmer. Two of the most wonderful people. She was just\na tiny little thing. He \u2014 my father resembled, he was the gentlest man, the \u2014\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: \u2014 I think I\u2019ve only seen twice, as young as I was. And I know the whole farm was\nbig, and I remember him milking the cow and bringing it to me warm, out of \u2014 right\nout of the cow. But when the war broke out, either they were killed \u2014 I know my\nfather\u2019s sister, very tragically, there was a movie that was called, the brievela(ph) de\nMama. You understand what that means? Letter to your mother?",
        "A: And apparently, some fire broke out, and she was trampled to death. And her\nname was Anutsa(ph). And my father told me this. It was just before, I guess, war\nfirst broke out. And that was tragic. Beyond that, I never really knew. I was too\nyoung. What happened to them, I don\u2019t know. His sister was alive in Israel, made it,\nbut when war broke out, every \u2014 everybody just flew in different direction.",
        "A: Oh, I had a few.",
        "A: Supposed to go to nursing school, but it didn\u2019t work out, because I couldn\u2019t stand\nanything being blood. And I was very good with my hands, and very athletic, as my\nmother was. She used to call herself a Maccabee, which she was in. I \u2014 I actually\nOctober 15, 2009\nhad a multitude of, after I got married, would bef \u2014 before I met my husband I\nworked for public health nurses. And \u2014",
        "A: That would have been in Canada. And I did volunteer work at a veteran\u2019s\nhospital up to the age that I got married. From about 15, myself and my friends\nwould go every Sunday and cook for the veterans. And I remember writing, they\nwere parachuters, and all that remained of them was just their bodies, they were like\nin \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you call those swings, you know, it\u2019s just the netting, it\u2019s like",
        "A: And I remember they couldn\u2019t write. And I would write letters to their\nsweethearts, nobody came to visit them. They gave me tremendous \u2014 myself and my\nfriends, but I loved that. We \u2014 I \u2014I loved doing that.",
        "A: It w \u20141t\u2014I don\u2019t \u2014I can\u2019t \u2014 I mean, at 16 you don\u2019t do things like that. There\nwere five of us, who we just stel \u2014 reunited in Toronto, Canada, and that\u2019s what we\ndid every Sunday. And it\u2019s \u2014 that \u2014 that was very fulfilling. That\u2019s the only way I\ncan describe it, very fulfilling, and back to your question as far \u2014 then I got married,\nand when I arrived in Connecticut I remembered all I could d-do \u2014 I was an\nOctober 15, 2009\nexcellent typist, so the thing to do was transcribe. And I applied to Manpower or\nsomething, and my typing was excellent. And ended up doing typing. And then my\nlanguages opened up doors again. My children were born and then I stopped\nworking, and my husband was in the printing business. And because of my\nlanguages, a friend called and says, Lili, you know how speak Yiddish fluently, and\nGerman and a little bit of Russian and Polish. There\u2019s a job opening at the Jewish\ncenter for the hot lunch program that consists of like 150 people. You have to do\nprogramming, it\u2019s quite involved. I said, I don\u2019t know, because my husband didn\u2019t\nwant me to work. Went down, I applied, got the job, was able to take \u2014 I was not\nallowed to work unless I brought \u2014 til my kids were in school, home for the kids\nafter school, those were the rules. And that was fine. So I brought my little one,\nwhich is my youngest, Stacey with me, and I remember loving work, just loving it.\nPrior to that \u2014 oh, after that, I remember \u2014 I thought, okay, I did that, she came with\nme. Now it\u2019s time to put her in a daycare and I will put her in a daycare and get\nmyself a job. The other two were in school, and Ill work around the kids. And\nironically enough, I went to sign her up, and I was sitting on the floor, reading her a\nbook til I could get the director. And I had three or four kids on my lap, a couple on\nmy back, and I\u2019m reading these books and these kids are all over me, and I think,\nwhat the heck? And she says to me, would you \u2014 well, what\u2019d you come here for?\nOctober 15, 2009\nAnd I says, to sign up my daughter. And she says, well, I\u2019ve got a better idea. You\ncome work for us. You see? So I ended up having a full time job, my daughter got in\nfree, and I started to work for the daycare. After that, I just loved working, and I end\n\u2014 from there, I went to work for special ed, as an aide. And because of my grades\nand what have you, I found myself working one on one, and I absolutely loved it.\nAnd I would go to different schools, and there was one, you know, some kids were\nwheelchair bound, couldn\u2019t talk, one was sign language. And I would work one on\none \u2014 one on one with them. That was another job. After that 1t was a multitude of\nincredible jobs, I don\u2019t know how I got them. Dad had to go, because now the kids\nwere all in school, and I thought, well, it\u2019s time to go on. I believe, if I\u2019m not\nmistaken, I worked for a bank. And that was again up to three o\u2019clock, and be home\nfor the kids. From the bank, I thought, well, let\u2019s see what else I can do, I love\npeople. I went to work for, happened to be two Jewish ladies, physical therapy. I\nwas a wer \u2014 answered the phone. It\u2019s \u2014 and I ended up giving physical therapy,\nwhich I didn\u2019t want to do, but she says, you\u2019ve got some nursing background. I\nended up doing physical therapy, which I shouldn\u2019t have done. And then, next thing\nI know is this friend of theirs wanted to open up this thing, adaptive clothing for the\nhandicapped. And she had \u2014 that\u2019s when Velcro first came in.\nOctober 15, 2009",
        "A: And she said, what do you think, Lili? So the one who owned the physical, she\nsays, I want you to meet this woman who came in, I think it was either Las Vegas,\nor I-I\u2019m not even sure where she lived, califor \u2014 someplace. She was a wonderful\nlady, we hit it off immediately. And she says, will you work with me on this, and\nwe\u2019 ll \u2014 somehow or other I got involved with her, and we opened up this thing. But,\nmy husband decided it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 that\u2019s enough. It was every eat \u2014 when I worked for\nthe Jewish Center, I was in the paper, because I was talking to governors and mayors\nand what have you. Whether that threatened him, I don\u2019t know, and I was in the\npaper, and then when I ope \u2014 started with this adaptive clothing for the handicapped,\nagain it was, you know, ribbon cutting, and that did it, it was just \u2014 ?m\u2014I\u2019m\nexposed, and there\u2019s just too much. So then, I think there was another job I was\napplying to, and that was \u2014 there were \u2014 I loved physical fitness and people, so I\napplied at, I remember, the YMCA in Hamden, Connecticut. And I thought,\nthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna get it, I mean, this 1s director for \u2014 and he says, I\u2019m very\ninterested. And I came home to tell my husband that I\u2019m going to possibly \u2014 you\nknow, I \u2014 I interviewed and there\u2019s a good chance, that was the end of my married\nlife, and what have you, and he says, no you\u2019re not, you\u2019re coming to work at Brody\nPrinting Company. If you\u2019re so great, you can prove it to me. And that was a bad\nmove, because I found the things \u2014 this was not the man I was married to, and\nOctober 15, 2009\nworking for him was not the things to do because the way he talked to people and\nhandled people is the way he hated other people handling him, not to get involved.\nAnd the marriage fell apart. And you ready? I was there with well, not three,\nbecause my daughter moved out, my oldest daughter, and she went to college, and\nso did the middle one. And the marriage \u2014 we went to Israel, my treat. The only way\nthe kids went on vacation 1s if I paid for it. And this was a wealthy man, who really\ndidn\u2019t like kids, but he wasn\u2019t a bad father, he just wasn\u2019t around, so I was basically\na single mom anyway. The reason I\u2019m saying this, and there is where the Holocaust,\nand my experience 1s making me what I am, I\u2019m grateful for. What does a woman\ndo with no credit cards, two children, three to take care of, had a beautiful home,\nwent on vacations, now I\u2019m alone, because the silence was deafening, the\nrelationship fell apart, and I kept on saying \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I go on vacations,\nI have a beautiful home, three beautiful children, what\u2019s going on, why am I\nunhappy? There was no conversation, it was \u2014 everything fell apart. There was no\ninteraction, and I was going into depression and I ended up div \u2014 taking the family,\nthe last hurrah, to Israel, where I met the cousin who split my head. And there were,\nI think, 12 of us at a table, and because my husband was well off at the time \u2014 and I\ntreated, with 7,000 dollars for that trip, and the best trip ever. And we got \u2014 the kids\ngot to see Israel. I met my \u2014 the family that was left over. And that \u2014 that was it,\nOctober 15, 2009\n1985, I went on my own. When we came back, the marriage was over, unbeknownst\nto me, there was somebody else for 15 years.",
        "A: That was \u2014 and back in the thing, I had to now, no credit cards, no car. What am I\ngonna do? Sold the house, which was mine, and went to school, and learned how to\nbe a court reporter. I worked in the court system.",

        "A: Thank you for listening.",
        "A: Only that someday my grandchildren, or gra \u2014 their grandchildren will hear this\nand just know it did happen, and their grandmother, or great-grandmother, or great-\ngreat-great grandmother went through it.
