        "Horn, Irving\nRG-50.233*057\nTwo Audio Cassettes\nRecorded January 11, 1992\nInterview by Anthony Young\nAbstract\nIrving Horn (born Isachar Herszenhorn) was born in February, 1927 in Radom, Poland.",
        "Irving remembers significant anti-Semitism as a child. When he was seven years old the Polish\ngovernment ordered the integration of schools. Irving and the only other Jewish boy at his new\nschool were severely beaten by some of their schoolmates. Upon the outbreak of the war,\nIrving\u2019s father lost his job and his brother was accused of spying and temporarily jailed. Irving\nattended a secret Jewish school for two years until Radom became a ghetto. Upon the\nliquidation of the Radom ghetto, Irving and his father volunteered to work on the Waschnik\nestate. Irving survived encounters with the SS, then worked in a weapons factory where he\nencountered Jacob Holz, a ruthless security guard whom Irving later testified against. Around\nJuly 25, 1944, Irving marched to Tomaszow because the Russians were approaching Radom.\nFrom Tomaszow, he took a train to Auschwitz. There, Irving, his father and his two brothers\nwere chosen to do work in Vaihingen an der Enz near Stuttgart. A guard sent Irving to work on\nthe Nazi Secretary of State\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s estate for two weeks, where he received food and\nregained his strength. He was then sent to Camp Unterriexingen, Kochendorf, and finally to\nDachau. Irving was in Tyrol at the end of the war but was taken back to Germany and almost\nshot into a ravine. Before the killing was to take place, the SS men changed into civilian clothes\nand left. Afterward, Irving ended up in a military hospital in Mittenwald due to severe hunger,\nand then spent several years in a displaced persons camp in Stuttgart before moving to the United\nStates in 1948.\nTape 1:\nAnthony: Go ahead.\nIrving: Well my name now is Irving Horn, but that\u2019s not my original name. I was born as\nIsachar Herszenhorn and I was born in the city of Radom, Poland. Eh...you want the date of\nbirth?\nAnthony: Sure.",
        "Irving: I was born in 1927.\nAnthony: What was the date, the month and day?\nIrving: February, 1927.\nAnthony: Ok. Can you tell me a little bit about your family life after you were born, that\nperiod...\nIrving: I come from a middle-income family and my father was a salesman in a tanning factory\nand I would say we were doing relatively well. Eh...life was comfortable except for a large\nscale anti-Semitism.\nAnthony: Do you remember some instances of this anti-Semitism?\nIrving: Yeah, when I was seven years old, because of an edict of the Polish government, we\nwere told that we had to start integrating a school and I was the only kid, Jewish kid, in a Polish\npublic school. The incident I remember most is that we were standing in the line to register for\nschool. Now Polish schools were not exactly like schools are here, they didn\u2019t have building by\nthemselves, and I believe that the school had the first and second floor and on the other floors,\nthere were tenants actually, and we were, the registration was on the second floor and we were\non the stairway after the second floor and there was another Jewish little boy who was thrown off\nthat stairway and he either broke a leg or he got badly hurt, and when we reached the office, and\nthe subject was discussed, the principal looked at my mother and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing it\nhappened to him, he had no business being here to begin with.\u201d So life was miserable at school,\nwe were always being beaten up. I was always being beaten up, being the only Jewish kid.\nAfter a year I transferred to another public school where there were three or four Jewish children\nin the class and there at least we had a chance of fighting. After two years there, I transferred to\na Jewish day school and the last day before the war I spent in a Jewish day school.\nAnthony: So you were there right before the war then?\nIrving: Right before the war.",
        "Anthony: And that\u2019s 1939?\nIrving: 1939. I was in the sixth grade, and the last thing I remember was passing a test for junior\nhigh, and getting ready to get to return to school on September 1939. That never happened...\nAnthony: Right. Did you have any brothers and sisters?\nIrving: Yeah, I have two brothers, twins, and I have a...my father and mother adopted a sister,\nso I had an adopted sister.\nAnthony: Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded in September, what you\nwere doing, what your family was doing, what happened?\nIrving: Well, before they invaded we were out on a summer vacation and we came back, and of\ncourse the war started September 1\u201c.\nAnthony: Where did you go to vacation, do you remember?\nIrving: A small town, not far away, about twelve miles south of Radom...and we returned...we\nreturned because my...well actually, I was there with my adopted sister, she was already\nmarried, and her husband got a draft notice, and we knew the war was on.\nAnthony: This is back in Radom, right?\nIrving: Yeah. It was a few days before the war started. And when we returned...well,\nmobilization was fully on, and shortly afterwards, which was Friday, if I remember, September\n1\u201c, the war started. Eh...there were bombings. The next day and the day after...\nAnthony: On Saturday and Sunday?",
        "Irving: Yeah. In fact, one hit very close and there was some machine gunning. And this town\nwas occupied a week later, on Friday the 8\" I believe.\nAnthony: What did the Germans do once they entered the town, once they took control and then\noccupied the town?\nIrving: Well, at first. Well let me say something, which 1s, maybe I shouldn\u2019t but historically\nit\u2019s true...there were a number of ethnic Germans in town who were actually welcoming the\nGermans. At the beginning what they...well let me give you a little incident on what happened\nwithin the first week. My brother walked down the street and he saw a...my brothers are seven\nyears older than I, and he saw a young man, a friend of his, that he used to tutor in high school, a\nPole. And all of a sudden the Pole called over a German and pointed to him and said that this\nJew said that the Russians are coming. And the Germans arrested my brother and all of a sudden\nhe found himself in a Gestapo basement.\nAnthony: Just on this Pole\u2019s recommendation?\nIrving: Yes. With three other Jews who were there. We didn\u2019t know they were there but we\nfound out they were there. And the Gestapo wouldn\u2019t even talk to my mother. They were\nbeating him up and they were ready to execute him for spying. The only person they wanted to\ntalk to was a representative of the Jewish population. Now, I don\u2019t think we had one per se, but\nwe did talk to the elder of the Jewish community. He went down, and after some negotiations,\nthey demanded a ransom from the community. A pretty high ransom if I remember, I don\u2019t\nremember the exact amount...I know we couldn\u2019t pay it as a family, but the town got together\nand they paid a ransom and all the prisoners got free.\nAnthony: They did release them?\nIrving: Yeah they released them. And that was the first incident. Also, we couldn\u2019t get any help\nfrom anybody else as far as the Polish population was concerned. When we saw the mother of\nthat boy, she said, \u201cWell, maybe he deserved it.\u201d\nAnthony: Right.",
        "Irving: Eh...I told you my father used to work for a tanning factory. The tanning factory\nactually belonged to ethnic Germans. And the day the war broke out they told him they could\nnot possibly have anything to do with a Jewish person, officially, anyhow. So he was out of a\njob. That\u2019s how it started.\nAnthony: This incident with your brother started...that was the first week of the occupation?\nIrving: I believe it happened on a Monday. It wasn\u2019t the first Monday, I think it was the second\nMonday after the occupation.\nAnthony: But shortly thereafter?\nIrving: Shortly thereafter. Eh...the other thing is there were a number of edicts that they issued.\nYou couldn\u2019t...you weren\u2019t allowed to have a radio. They closed all the schools, there was no\neducation allowed. There...assemblies of persons of more than five people were not allowed.\nAll this was punishable by death penalty or ten years, or whatever. I don\u2019t remember the exact\npunishment. Eh...\nAnthony: You said something about the ethnic Germans welcoming the Germans into Poland.\nWere Poles doing that also? Or was that...were they happy to see the Germans or was it just\nusually the ethnic Germans?\nIrving: I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I know there were people with flowers who were\nwelcoming them when they were marching into town. I don\u2019t know who they were. I have no\nidea. But I\u2019d assume they were ethnic Germans.\nAnthony: Do you remember before the Germans invaded, do you remember any...I don\u2019t know\nthe best word...do you remember anything...were you frightened of the Germans coming\nbecause you were Jewish?\nIrving: Yes. Of course. By reputation we knew what they are capable of doing. We absorbed a\nnumber of German refugees between 1936 and 1939. And in fact there was a German girl who\nused to sleep in our house, she used to eat with us. And she was a German refugee. And we\nknew what was going on...we were aware what they were capable of doing. But not exactly of\nkilling... but of all anti-Jewish laws; you weren\u2019t allowed to own anything or do anything.",
        "Anthony: Do you remember, going back to the last part of 1939, what happened in\nRadom...other than you\u2019ve told me of these edicts and things like that. What things can you\nremember about that last part of 1939 when the Germans had already occupied the town?\nIrving: Shortages. Bread shortages. Meat shortages. All type of different shortages. There\nwere...[pause]. I was only a boy. I was only four years old. My world was probably different\nthan the world of an adult.\nAnthony: Sure.\nIrving: My main preoccupation was the fact that we couldn\u2019t go back to school. That changed.\nNot immediately, but within the next three months or so. One day I was walking into a store and\nthe owner came out and told me that he wanted to talk to my mother. And then the next day, we\nwere in a secret school. There were ten of us. Maybe ten or eleven.\nAnthony: Was this a Jewish school?\nIrving: All Jews, yeah. Mostly students from the day school. It was run by a Ms. Sobol. She\nwas a teacher in that day school. And we always had somebody on guard. And we were trained\nto give signals in case the Germans would approach. Of course it would be very dangerous if we\nwere caught. But we were going to school for two years, two and a half years, going through\njunior high and most of...some of high school, without being able to carry a book or paperwork\nor anything of that sort because they immediately became suspicious. And of course nobody\ncould have known. Ifa neighbor had known or a Pole would have seen us or detected us they\nimmediately would have pointed it out. That was quite an enterprise.\nAnthony: Was the teacher, was she involved in setting this up, or was there someone else...\nIrving: She lived with a family, I don\u2019t know if they were related to her, they must have been in\nan apartment. The apartment was right on Main St. and they set it up. I presume she was\ninvolved in it...I don\u2019t really know. But yeah...it was quite a group there.",
        "Anthony: That\u2019s very interesting. In fact, it\u2019s a story that I haven\u2019t heard about. I mean I knew\nthat people would set up schools in ghettos and things like that, but this isn\u2019t a ghetto, and this is\nvery dangerous.\nIrving: This is not a ghetto, no. In fact, as it went along, it got more and more difficult to get to\nthe place because it was right on Main St. and for a while, later on, we weren\u2019t even allowed to\nwalk on Main St. as Jews, so we had to go through the back door. And we did that. Until it\nbecame a ghetto, we were going to that school.\nAnthony: And that was almost two years you said?\nIrving: \u2018Till 1941, April 1941. I believe we started in 1939. I\u2019m sure, we started in 1939.\nAnthony: And so in 1941 the ghetto was set up.\nIrving: In 1941 the ghetto was set up.\nAnthony: Can you tell me a little bit about the ghetto, what that was like when they set it\nup...what the restrictions were, was it a closed, walled ghetto, or...\nIrving: It was a closed ghetto and walled. The ghetto...it had...well...no it wasn\u2019t exactly\nwalled, no. It had entrances on both sides, which you could easily go through. In fact, to go\nfrom one side of the non-ghetto area to the other side of the non-ghetto area they had to go\nthrough a street, which ran right through the ghetto. So no, it wasn\u2019t walled.\nAnthony: Did you know people who would go back and forth, who would sneak back and forth?\nIrving: Yeah. I did too. Well, there were two ghettos that they set up actually, there was one\nghetto on one side of the town and the other ghetto, the main ghetto. Where we lived before the\nwar was actually where the main ghetto was set up. We didn\u2019t even have to move.\nAnthony: Was the main ghetto, was that in a suburb, or was that in the middle of town?",
        "Irving: It was in the old town, called the old town.\nAnthony: And that was the main ghetto, does that mean it was larger than the other one?\nIrving: Yeah. Well, it was a historically, traditionally a Jewish area. Yeah, it was larger than\nthe other one. The other one was not historically a Jewish area and was on the other side of\ntown. But there were a number of people that commuted between the two because they had a\njob...\nAnthony: Between the two ghettos?\nIrving: Right and they had permits to go on bicycles between one and the other. Well...I can\ngive you an incident, I\u2019m going to deviate slightly.\nAnthony: Sure, no, that\u2019s fine.\nIrving: My father, in order to make a living, he went back to tanning during the war, which was\nillegal for us, but he...\nAnthony: Why was it illegal?\nIrving: Anything was illegal for Jews. You were only supposed to work for the Germans.\nAnthony: So he was doing this on the side in order to make a living for himself and the family?\nIrving: Yes. And then what he would do was stay home and [?] tan calf...rawhide, and then sell\nthe leather someplace else, a small town...but in order to transport it, he couldn\u2019t transport it out\nof the ghetto, he sometimes used Polish farmers who put it on a wagon and put hay on top and\nhide it. One day, my brother used to work, he had a permit to go from one ghetto to the other.\nOne day when he was travelling through, going from the large ghetto to the other ghetto, he saw\nthat wagon of hay with the man that he knew, with the Pole that he knew, standing on the market\non the main street, near the police station. Unfortunately, he went over to find out why, and\nwhen the Polish police saw him, they arrested him.",
        "Anthony: Is this the same brother who was arrested before?\nIrving: Yeah. And after that, of course, they started looking for my father. Well first of all, he\nwas in prison. While he was in prison we then wanted to find out what was happening because\nwe had no idea. And what we found out was routinely they would take them out, at eleven\no\u2019clock in the morning, something like that, and take him from there to Gestapo headquarters for\ninterrogation.\nAnthony: Now this is your father?\nIrving: No, my brother. From the prison, to Gestapo headquarters. So that was early June,\n1941. And we were in the ghetto already, so me and my other brother, who 1s his twin, looks\nlike Fagan, we took our armbands off that identified us as Jews and walked in front of the\npoliceman right down Main St. I mean not in front, in back. They were walking in front and we\nwere in the back, and had a conversation with him. He wouldn\u2019t turn around, he was talking\nright in front...and we were talking right through Main St. without our armbands on.\nAnthony: Had you done that before?\nIrving: No. Never done it before. The amazing thing is that they had to cross the street, this\nwas the main street, to take him to Gestapo headquarters and they couldn\u2019t cross the street for\nover 45 minutes because the German armies were marching east, there were hundreds of\nthousands of Germans, and this is early June...\nAnthony: Right, just before the invasion.\nIrving: Hundreds of thousands, just walking down the street. So they were standing on the\ncorner and we were talking to him, and they couldn\u2019t cross the street. So that\u2019s...you were\nasking if people would go out...some people would just go out like we did.\nAnthony: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "Irving: People would do that. In the early days yes, but then later they used to catch them and\nexecute them for that or put them in prison for ten years, which is the same as execution. It was\ndangerous...\nAnthony: Did people go outside the ghetto to try to get food, and things like that from the\nregion...because you mentioned shortages.\nIrving: I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re asking the wrong...I was a kid.\nAnthony: Sure.\nIrving: I was thirteen years old, fourteen years old...that wasn\u2019t really my duty\u2014I don\u2019t know.\nI did this later in the concentration camp, but I didn\u2019t do it in the ghetto.\nAnthony: So we\u2019re talking about June 1941, right before the invasion. Did things change in\nRadom once the invasion started, could you sense a difference?\nIrving: Well, yeah, the ghetto, things in the ghetto started getting worse and worse. There was\nhunger. There were different levels of life in the ghetto. There was an affluent level, which\nlived normal...but the poor who had no food, there was disease...and there was no way to get\nanything...and overcrowding. There were three or four families to an apartment. And disease\nwas one of the worst, there was typhus, all kind of diseases...and then there were raids by the\nGermans. They would come in the night and arrest and shoot people...\nAnthony: Was there any particular reason given, or they just did this?\nIrving: No. They would have lists, and at various times there were different people they would\narrest. At one time they came and arrested...don\u2019t ask me why, but they arrested the kosher\nbutchers...they picked up the kosher butchers. I had a friend who was my age, who lived in our\nhouse, a young boy, and they arrested him, and they held him for a while and then they brought\nhim back one night. Right in front, we had a little area, which there was no building on it, it was\na little garden, and they brought him back right to that garden right in the middle of the night.\nWe heard them all scream, \u201cMama, mama!\u201d And shot him right there where his mother could\nhear him and then a while later they came and picked up most of the kosher butchers and sent\nthem to Auschwitz. But meanwhile, while they were picking them up they would shoot a",
        "number of them and if they would come to an apartment and not find the right person they would\ntake somebody else like a brother or another relative...\nAnthony: So they were looking for specific people as far as you could tell?\nIrving: Yeah, generally.\nAnthony: They had like a list or something?\nIrving: Yeah, they would come to our house and pick people up. But if they\u2019re not there they\nwould pick others. But if they would find, and those raids usually would be in the morning,\nearly in the morning. And I know in some of those raids they found some people who were\ngoing to work like 5:30, 6:00 in the morning and they shot them, just \u2018cause they were moving\naround and wanted to come to work. Why, I have no idea. So those raids got more and more,\ncame more and more often...\nAnthony: More frequent.\nIrving: More frequent.\nAnthony: Did...do you remember when those raids were, do you remember dates at all,\nroughly?\nIrving: Between 1941 and 1942.\nAnthony: Ok.\nIrving: There were a number of those.\nAnthony: Do you remember, were you living in your house in the ghetto since you...I know you\nmentioned that your house was already in where the ghetto was set up.",
        "Irving: Except two other families moved in.\nAnthony: Two other families moved in...\nIrving: And we shared, we had a three-room apartment, so there were two other families moved\nin...\nAnthony: Um...why don\u2019t we go on, uh...and move to the, when you left the ghetto, when you\nand the family left the ghetto.\nIrving: Well, we didn\u2019t leave the ghetto. Sometime in August 1942, they liquidated the ghetto,\nthe second ghetto. They came and took all the people and sent them to Treblinka, to the gas\nchambers.\nAnthony: Now was this the SS, or was this just German guards, or do you remember?\nIrving: That was, must be SS, helped by the Ukrainians.\nAnthony: So Ukrainians were there.\nIrving: Ukrainians were guards. I really don\u2019t know because they...that was the other side of\nthe ghetto. I mean, they only left...they killed several hundred people that night. They only left\nabout a thousand males and I don\u2019t know how many females, not many.\nAnthony: Was this in the main ghetto?\nIrving: The other ghetto. The Glinice it\u2019s called Glinice. And that was the beginning.\nThen there were rumors that they\u2019re going to liquidate the large ghetto any day now. Actually,\nthey did, probably about ten days later. And sometime...it began in August 1942. I don\u2019t know\nthe exact date, but it was some time in August. It was right before the Jewish New Year.\nThey...it was a Sunday morning, and they started installing bright lights so we knew something\nwas going to happen that day...there were these two ghettos and there was a group of people\nwho worked in a factory. There was a factory in town that produced weapons owned by",
        "Austrians, and Austrian company [341]. And there were a number of people\nwho were stationed at that factory and one of my brothers was there and my mother was\nsupposed to that day go to the factory, but when they started installing the lights, everybody was\ntrying...they knew that something was going to happen that day. Somehow they came in that\nmorning and they were looking for some people to go and work in a place called\nWashnik [ph, 347], which is an estate, four or five miles out of town. So me and my",
        "father volunteered for that. We went to work there. So we walked out with that group, and\nmother was supposed to go to the weapons factory, from what I hear by the time she was ready\nto go the Ukrainians were there and they wouldn\u2019t let her go any more.\nAnthony: From the house?\nIrving: From the ghetto.\nAnthony: Oh, from out of the ghetto.\nIrving: So she got deported with everybody else in that ghetto. Only about ten percent were left\nor so. But I wasn\u2019t there that night. I was in Washnik...eh...we were on a little estate working\nfor...and we didn\u2019t know what was happening. Of course, we saw all those bright lights and\nheard shooting all night. From what I understand there were about 1,500 people killed that night\nand some 20,000 or so which were deported. A few days later we decided, the remainder of us\ngot sent to something called the small ghetto...\nAnthony: Oh, they sent the rest of them to the small ghetto?\nIrving: In the small ghetto there remained about two or three streets left from the ghetto. And\nthat was walled in. Now...we decided to eh...we meaning me and another fellow about a year\nolder than I am, we were standing in water most of the time working on that estate, we caught a\ncold. I didn\u2019t feel so well so we went to...the man who ran that was a German, he was not an SS\nman, he was a civilian. So we went to him and we told him we didn\u2019t feel well and we\u2019d like to\ngo see a doctor, we actually wanted to go out and see what happened to the little ghetto. And he\nfinally relented and said he\u2019d let us go and gave us a Jewish policeman who was there to escort\nus. And he said he\u2019ll give us a letter so we can go safely. He gave us a letter and we left, on the\nway, my brother worked in a factory on the way, so we stopped in to see him.\nAnthony: This is the armaments factory?",
        "Irving: No, no. My other brother who was in the ghetto. He survived, there was a selection,\nsome of the men were left, and he was part of the remainder. And he was working in a factory\nthat was on the way from us to the ghetto. So we stopped and he told me, of course we knew\nthen that my mother is gone, most of the people were gone. By that time we opened the letter to\nsee what it said. And what it said was, it was a letter from that man to the German police saying,\n\u201cThese two Jews are lazy. They don\u2019t want to work, and I suggest you execute them.\u201d Of\ncourse, we never delivered the letter. We just went back to the little ghetto and disappeared.\nLuckily, they didn\u2019t look for us. But that\u2019s how I got back to the little ghetto. Now this is what\nwe called the little ghetto, there of course everybody was assigned a working detail. Most people\nwere working in cleaning up the remainder of the large ghetto. There were some other details. I\nworked on...in a place that provided a shower and a steam bath for the people. It was outside, it\nwas in the old ghetto, but outside the little ghetto. And things there were very bad. There were\nall kind of bad actions, constantly going on, every few weeks...Um...some, well let me tell you\none personal thing that happened.\nAnthony: Sure, sure.\nIrving: When I was working...which 1s just an example or whatever...when I was working in\nthat eh...place outside the ghetto, one day, there was a bakery right down the street, a Polish\nbakery...\n[break]\nAnthony: Ok, you were talking about a Polish bakery...\nIrving: Yeah. There was a Polish bakery, so we went out. It was very difficult to get food. The\nonly way we got food, the Poles would come to the wall, it was a wooden wall, a fence, and we\nwould give them some of those clothes that were left over and we\u2019d trade it for food. And I\nwanted to buy some bread so I went in and there was a line out. I took my arm band off, of\ncourse I didn\u2019t have much of an accent, so... and I was standing 1n line and I almost got to the\ncounter to buy a piece of bread. And there were working men here, probably my age, maybe a\nyear older...he saw me at the counter and started screaming, \u201cYou\u2019re selling to Jews! You\u2019re\nselling to Jews!\u201d So Iran out. And he went and got Germans and the Germans start looking for\nme. And I had to hide, it\u2019s a good thing they didn\u2019t find me. If they had found me they would\nhave executed me. That\u2019s the type of relations we had... You were asking if we risked going\nout...it got very difficult. There were constant executions, people would...by the Germans. A\nlot of the executions were done by the S.D., the Sicherheitsdienst [450]. They would bring",
        "people in, we don\u2019t know who, and execute them right near-by. At one time in that little ghetto\nthere was a...they announced that there will be a list of people who want to go to Palestine. At\nfirst people didn\u2019t want to register but then finally people registered, and I and my brother\nregistered for that. And one day, and that was January 13, 1943, they got everybody out of the\nhouse and put them into a back yard and started calling names. And the names that they were\ncalling were from that list. There was only one difference, they weren\u2019t all from that list. Some\nof the names were changed, how and when we don\u2019t know. Our names were not there.\nSomebody changed some of the names. But names were called, they were called from that list.\nThere were about 1,500 names on that list, and those people were put in the street. Now the\nquestion is, we knew one of the groups would survive and the other would go away, and we just\ndidn\u2019t know which. But it became apparent that because of the names that did appear on the list\nthat the group who is on the list is going to be the one that survives. Eventually, I ran forward\nafter they finished reading the list. The elder of the ghetto was a doctor...\nAnthony: Was that who was reading the list?\nIrving: No. The Germans. Some...but no. A Jewish man was reading the list, one of the\nsecretaries. But there were two Germans who were checking the list because the men were\nrunning out. If you didn\u2019t show up when your name was called\u2014forget 1t\u2014they read another\none.\nAnthony: Did the...Jewish council, or the Judenrat, did they take the list down, or did the\nGermans take the list?\nIrving: Don\u2019t know. Well...what happened is that I ran out there and the lady who was running\nthe place where I worked, her name was Ms. Zucker, and she was an acquaintance of that doctor\nwho was the elder of the ghetto. All of a sudden he called out for Ms. Zucker and her family.\nAnd I ran up and they stopped me and they said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d and I said, \u201cI am her brother.\u201d\nAnd they checked with him and he said, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s her brother.\u201d\u2019 Of course he knew I\u2019m not,\nbut he did. So he saved my life for that...so they let me go. And that\u2019s how I wound up with the\ncolumn [503] that was safe. Now they took those 1,500 people, which were about half, then they\nadded some other, 50 or 100. That part, that column stayed. The other people were just sent on\nthe train and sent out to Treblinka.\nAnthony: So you were able to stay in the ghetto because you were pretending to be a brother\nof...Did your brother, did he remain?",
        "Irving: Yeah. He remained because all of a sudden they needed another 50 people or something\nand somehow they picked him.\nAnthony: For a work detail or something?\nIrving: No. They just needed 50 more. I don\u2019t know why. They pushed them over, and he\nsomehow wound up with those too. At the end he found out that he was lucky too. We both\nsurvived. Now, there were executions. One day they called all people who had degrees,\ndoctors, lawyers, and put them in a truck and the Ukrainians took them out to a small town\noutside the city and shot them. But that type of thing was happening...\nAnthony: Right...\nIrving: My father and my brother were in the factory that produced the...the weapons factory.\nSo sometime I think in April.\nAnthony: Of 1943?\nIrving: 1943, yeah. I, they took me over there too. So I started working there too. Now there\nwas a camp that, there was a working camp. We all worked in the factory, two sheds, and slept\nin a camp a little bit away from the factory. And we were guarded by Ukrainians mostly. But in\nthe factory there were a number of ethnic Germans who were guard...eh...guard...\nAnthony: Security people?\nIrving: Security guards. And they really had the upper hand...they used to...\nAnthony: These were ethnic Germans?\nIrving: Yeah. One of them especially. His name was Holz, H-O-L-Z, Jacob Holz. He used\nto...he executed about eighteen people. One of them...he forced everybody to watch, as this\nyoung boy, a young man who I knew, he was a friend of mine, his name was Weinberg, and the",
        "whole camp had to watch it. And they executed him. The reason they executed him is I believe,\nbecause he fell asleep...\nAnthony: While he was working?\nIrving: Yeah. One day they called me over. My job there was to sweep the street, sweep the\nyard. They called me over one day in the morning. And he was there and he told me to dig a\ngrave for a freshly killed body of a young boy. And he told me to bury it. And I started\nburying...and he kept that gun in front of me and said, \u201cBury it, and if you don\u2019t do it quickly,\nyou\u2019re going to be buried, too\u201d He was something...\nAnthony: This was the same Holz?\nIrving: The same Holz. He also killed a...there were some people escaped and when they came\nthey got...I think it was some relatives with two children, and they executed...I didn\u2019t see it.\nAbout eighteen people. Now I went and testified against him.\nAnthony: You did?\nIrving: Yeah, a few years ago, a couple of years ago, not long ago in Eastern Germany. They\ngot him. Ok, that\u2019s the part in the factory. Now sometime in 1944...\nAnthony: Now actually let me ask you a question real quick about where you were working in\nthis factory. You said that you used to sleep at the factory...?\nIrving: No, at the camp outside the factory.\nAnthony: At the camp, ok. How far was this from the ghetto in Radom?\nIrving: Oh, it was on the other side of town.\nAnthony: Oh, so it was very, very near.",
        "Irving: Near? What do you mean, near? On the other side of town.\nAnthony: But it wasn\u2019t like twenty miles out of town?\nIrving: No, no.\nAnthony: And there was a camp set up around the factory for the workers, for the prisoners\nbasically I guess to be taken at night? Or did you all sleep in the factory?\nIrving: Oh, we never slept in the factory. We slept in the camp. There were two shifts\u2014in the\nmorning a shift marched into the factory and worked all day and in the evening they went back to\nthe camp and then another shift walked in...they worked in the factory and stayed in camp.\nAnthony: Ok, ok. And another question...Holz, the guard, you said he was an ethnic German.\nWas he an ethnic German who was a Polish citizen or was he a German SS guard?\nIrving: No. He was not an SS guard. He is an ethnic German. From what I understand now,\nand I didn\u2019t know then, he is an illiterate ethnic German. No, he is not an SS guard.\n[Flip Tape]\nIrving: Sometime in 1943 we...they brought in the people from the small ghetto and combined\nthe two camps into the camp of the...from the factory, from the weapons factory, combined the\ntwo camps and shortly afterwards it became a concentration camp. Now, if you ask me for a\ndate, I don\u2019t know, it might have been November 1943...\nAnthony: Ok, but some time in 1943.\nIrving: Yeah. I think it was 1943, yeah...and at that time the SS took over, we had a new set of\nguards. In fact, they were trained to be concentration guards and all that...and we got\nconcentration camp uniforms, hats and all that, and we were there until July 1944. Again, the\nsame thing repeated, there were constant raids here and there. They would pick a number of",
        "people and kill them. Just before we left, a few months before that, they took a number of people\nwho were carpenters, I don\u2019t know why they needed carpenters, I think they wanted to erase any\nof the marks that they left. And these people disappeared, apparently they executed them.\nAnthony: In this camp you were taken to the armaments factory to work, from this camp. Can\nyou tell me a little bit about working in the armaments factory? What you did, what your job\nwas...?\nIrving: Personally?\nAnthony: Yeah.\nIrving: I personally cleaned the yard.\nAnthony: Oh, right, you told me that. Ok.\nIrving: Most of the other people worked on eh...a line doing...building bicycles or building\nweapons or whatever...yeah.\nAnthony: And that\u2019s what your brother and father were doing at that time?\nIrving: Yeah.\nAnthony: Were both your brothers there?\nIrving: Oh, my father was also working cleaning the yard.\nAnthony: And both your brothers were then working in armaments, they were doing...on the\nassembly line?",
        "Irving: Yeah. Around July, shortly after, July 20\", 22\", 23 of July, we started hearing noises\nwhich were, well, surprising noises, which were...at first we thought it was thunder, but it\ndoesn\u2019t really thunder. But those were the approaching Russian army. They were actually in\nLublin, which is only 30 to 40 miles down the road. And we had some Polish people who did\nsome training and at that time we asked them if we could stay with them for a week or two\nbecause we thought the Russians would be there within a week. They refused. No way. But\naround the 25\" or 26\" of July, again the dates, I cannot be exact...the...we were all evacuated.\nWe walked out of the camp. We walked down the streets of the city. And if I remember, there\nwere a lot of Polish workers who were just looking at us, believe it or not, applauding.\nAnthony: Do you know what for?\nIrving: The fact that apparently that we were leaving the city. I\u2019ll never forget that. I shut out a\nlot of sounds that happened during the war, but I\u2019ll never shut out that sound. I never will.\nAnthony: The applause?\nIrving: Ill always remember that. There were some people who tried to run away that day.\nAnd they went into a local building until some of the Poles indicated where they are. The\nGermans got them and they were shot. We walked for several nights and several days. On the\nsecond day or the third day, actually, well maybe it was the second day of the march, they asked\nthat the people who were weak and they couldn\u2019t walk be put in a horse and buggy in the\nback...and then...so they shouldn\u2019t get too weak...and in the evening we used to...at night we\nslept in the fields. Wherever we were they would select a field, and we\u2019d sleep in that field.\nAnd that night, before we got to the field, the sick people in the buggy got driven into the forest\nand executed by the guards. And the guards for that march were all Lithuanians or Ukrainians.\nAnthony: So were there any SS?\nIrving: There were SS. There were the regular SS that were with us.\nAnthony: But the majority...",
        "Irving: But the majority...they used a lot of Lithuanians and well, there might have been others,\nLatvians...I don\u2019t know. Ok...it was a very tough march. We marched to a place called\nTomaszow.\nAnthony: Did they tell you where you were going? Or not at all...\nIrving: Just started marching. We were hoping at the time that the Russians would get there,\nbut...\nAnthony: Get there right...\nIrving: But apparently they stopped. As we know now, they stopped for several months, but we\ndidn\u2019t know it then. They kept us in this Tomaszow factory, in a factory that was idle at the\ntime, for several days.\nAnthony: Could you spell the name of that town for me?\nIrving: T-O-M-A-S-C-O-W.\nAnthony: Ok.\nIrving: And it\u2019s got a yetski [ph 701] on the end because of...\nAnthony: Right.\nIrving: And we stayed in that factory for, I don\u2019t know, I think it was about eight or nine days.\nThey separated the women from the men. The men stayed in the factory, the women, I believe,\nstayed in a local jail, I\u2019m not sure.\nAnthony: Were they feeding you on this march at all?",
        "Irving: Yeah. I think they did. I\u2019m not quite sure. I don\u2019t remember anymore, it wasn\u2019t that\ntype of a thing. We had a shortage of water. We did not have enough water. As I remember,\none night when we stopped everybody ran to get water and they started shooting and some\npeople got wounded because of that.\nAnthony: Because they went for the water?\nIrving: Because they went for the water. So we had water problems, but I don\u2019t think there were\nfood problems, I can\u2019t remember that. On a Saturday, one Saturday, they put us in wagons and\ntransported us from there to Auschwitz.\nAnthony: This was on a train? Train-wagons?\nIrving: Right.\nAnthony: From this town?\nIrving: From this town. We arrived in Auschwitz on a Sunday morning. I\u2019m not going to give\nyou a date because I don\u2019t remember...sometime in August 1944. I don\u2019t know exactly, but it\nwas a Sunday morning. While there, it was early in the morning...about...the first thing we\nknow they told us to get out of the cars and line up for a selection. While we were lining up for a\nselection, they said, \u201cHold on, hold on, it\u2019s a mistake, go back.\u201d So we went back into the cars\nand we heard another car coming. And while we were sitting there a train came in from a place\ncalled Lodz, L-O-D-Z. I don\u2019t know how many people were on it, it was a large train, I think\nthere were about 4,000 people on that train. And while we were standing there they emptied that\ntrain, took all the people, all of them. And what we saw on that train, they came from a ghetto,\nLodz still was a ghetto at the time. And they were eh...there were some children there. We\ndidn\u2019t see the children because we were in a camp already...there were no children. It was\nsupposed to be a population from maybe fourteen [ph] years old. And eh...they took all these\npeople and sent them to the gas chamber. All of them within a few minutes.\nAnthony: Was there a sense on your train that you were being held for some work purpose or\nnot? That you...since you hadn\u2019t been sent--?",
        "Irving: We didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know. We had no idea. We thought, then they told us to\nline up. We thought, they\u2019re going to do the same thing with us. But they didn\u2019t. What they did\nis they took the people who looked young and looked old, we were also told to watch out\nbecause they were looking for twins. My brothers were twins. My father at the time was 48 or\n49 and I of course was seventeen. So we were all a problem. What we did is they separated,\nthey weren\u2019t standing together. I didn\u2019t shave, and my father shaved twice. Somehow we got\nthough. But they did take, I don\u2019t know, maybe 1,000 people, maybe 2,000 people.\nAnthony: Did they ask you your age?\nIrving: No, because it went through, you know, like a short arm inspection in the army. You\nknow what a short arm inspection is?\nAnthony: Yeah.\nIrving: That\u2019s what they did. They just picked out... you go this way, you go this way...and\nthat\u2019s it.\nAnthony: Can we backtrack just a little bit? Can you tell me about the train ride to Auschwitz?\nIrving: I already told you about it. It\u2019s just locked, and we were about 60, 70 people in a car.\nAnd the car was locked, and it was overnight. I mean we left in the afternoon and got in there at\nthree in the morning. It wasn\u2019t that long a ride. It was not that momentous a ride. We were\nmostly in fear, so...we didn\u2019t...I don\u2019t have any recollections.\nAnthony: Alright.\nIrving: We left Auschwitz and the thing that I recall 1s that we stopped...we left Auschwitz\nSunday afternoon.\nAnthony: They put you back on the train to leave?",
        "Irving: Except the women. They kept the women. The women remained in Auschwitz. The\nmen were put back on the train...and essentially most of the same SS guards came back, and\nthen some new ones. But not the Lithuanians. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. Well,\nsome of them...not all of them came, some of the guards we knew. And we started off on a\njourney. Well, the first stop was in Czechoslovakia as I remember, the next morning. It is\ninteresting that when we stopped in Czechoslovakia, we saw...we saw a train going the other\nway, filled with French Jews.\nAnthony: French Jews?\nIrving: Yeah. And all they wanted to know was how far it is...how much longer they have to\nget to Dachau to Auschwitz. That\u2019s the only thing. And we continued. Essentially, we went to,\nI don\u2019t really know what path we took...\nAnthony: Did they let you off the train at all?\nIrving: No, only on the train. We went all the way from there, I guess through Czechoslovakia\nand Austria, Bavaria and Stuttgart.\nAnthony: To Stuttgart, ok...\nIrving: And in Stuttgart I think they took us into a delousing and shower and then they reloaded\nus and took us to a camp called Vaihingen, which is near Stuttgart, twenty miles from Stuttgart.\nIt\u2019s Vaihingen an der Enz, there\u2019s also a suburb of Stuttgart called Vaihingen, it\u2019s Vaihingen an\nder Enz, which is about twenty miles down the road. Now that camp, it was brand new. There\nwas nobody there. We were the first inhabitants. It consisted of five wooden buildings, maybe\nsix wooden buildings, no walks, all mud. The latrines that were just a hole covered with a roof\nand very few basic things available. And the labor there was to build. I don\u2019t really know what\nwe were doing. I think we were building some kind of armament factory.\nAnthony: But you weren\u2019t actually building armaments, it was building some sort of factory...\nIrving: No, no. A factory, it was building a building. It was a baustelle, the German word for\nbaustelle, bau-stelle, that\u2019s what we worked on\u2014the baustelle. I don\u2019t really know what we\nwere building...em...we would line up in the morning and each group would go out to a",
        "different type of work. Now, the em...food situation, although you get...a cup of coffee in the\nmorning. And there wasn\u2019t coffee there was smoked chicory or something. And a cup of soup\nand a slice of bread.\nAnthony: That\u2019s it for the day?\nIrving: That\u2019s it. And, eh...1t didn\u2019t take very long before people started dying. And the rate of\ndeath was pretty high. Of course then diseases came in...lice, there was no soap, no washing\nfacilities, no shower. There was a shower built later, but the shower built outside the camp. I\nwasn\u2019t there when the shower was built, but I understand that the day they put in the shower they\nevacuated. So I don\u2019t know about it. But it was built outside the camp so you\u2019d have to run out\nnaked to take the shower and come back. Ok? But I wasn\u2019t even there then. So I couldn\u2019t even\ntake a shower this way. There was no shower.\nAnthony: Were you working? Was this building underground or was it above ground?\nIrving: The buildings?\nAnthony: Yeah, the buildings, the factories, or whatever.\nIrving: No. It wasn\u2019t a factory, it was a baustelle, we were building things, we were putting\nthings together. There were German baumeisters, they were directing us. We were taking stones\nfrom here and putting them over here.\nAnthony: Ok, I see.\nIrving: We were doing some buildings. We were building some things. I don\u2019t know what they\nwere doing. I have no idea. There was...there are things I can...there are some things I can tell\nyou about this camp, which I feel are interesting.\nAnthony: Sure.",
        "Irving: Which is...unusual. The guards, we started learning about some of the guards. Some of\nthem were very mean, they beat us. They were very mean. But some of them were less mean.\nOne of the less mean of the guards, whose nickname was Gabba...\nAnthony: Gabba?\nIrving: Yeah, we called him Gabba. Now I don\u2019t know what his real name 1s. I learned that if\nyou went with the Gabba you usually got a better assignment. So one day I went to work for the\nGabba. And it turned out that that day he took us to a place, which was not the building, not the\nbaustelle, but something in the opposite direction. We went to the forest and then we wound up\non an estate. It was quite different. First of all, there was a big tub of potatoes being boiled.\nAnd some of the people, there were maybe thirty people. They called some of the people to go\nand get some hay. The rest of the people were near the potato pot. And there was nobody near\nus. And when we saw...I mean we were hungry! And we saw boiled potatoes standing there...I\nmean this is a big estate, it was a nice background and a nice house...we turned the pot over and\nstarted going after the potatoes, grabbing the potatoes and trying to eat. And the SS of course\nstarted hitting us with their rifles. And then this lady came out and started screaming at the SS,\ntelling them to stop it. They can\u2019t do this, not in her place...they\u2019ll never do this. And all ofa\nsudden they stopped. They listened. We didn\u2019t know why, how, what\u2019s happening. Turned out\nthat the place belonged to the baroness from Neurath. She was a German noble. Her\nbrother-in-law was the Secretary of State in Hitler\u2019s cabinet. During the war he was the\nprotector of Himmler. He got twelve years in Nuremberg.\nAnthony: Ok.\nIrving: But she said that while we worked at her, we are not to be touched. She was a good\nprotector. She protected us. And they wouldn\u2019t. After that they made an agreement. She said,\nif you\u2019re going to work for her, we\u2019re going to get food. We\u2019re going to help get the food from\nthe trees. Any fruit that\u2019s on the trees is hers\u2014any fruit that falls off, we can have. That type of\nthing. And she was very nice. There was one young man that she particularly liked and she\nwould sometimes invite him to do some special things. And she was very good to us. She was a\nvery nice lady. And we used to get a lot of fruit and things improved because we had extra food.\nWe could live there. I worked on that place for about two weeks. And it really helped me. It\nreally put me on my feet. And one of my brothers worked there too, he was on the same duty.\nThat helped us a lot. Now her daughter is alive. She was a book-burner.\nAnthony: Oh really?",
        "Irving: Yeah. And...so...\nAnthony: Your other brother and your father were back in the camp?\nIrving: Yeah. They worked on other details. We worked on that detail. Well, it turned out that\nafter two weeks they decided, this is constantly going on, they were sending out 50 people to one\ncamp, 50 people to another camp. Slowly new people were coming into the camp Vaihingen an\nder Enz. Other camps, other nationalities. At first when we first went in we were all from the\nsame town. We were all the same. Slowly, new people came in from other cities, other nations.\nAnd after working there for two weeks they took the four of us, my two brothers, my father and\nme, and they sent us to Unterriexingen. Eh...that\u2019s another camp, which is about seven miles\ndown the road.\nAnthony: From Stuttgart or from Vaihingen?\nIrving: From Vaihingen an der Enz. About seven or eight miles down the road. Now who came\nthere. There was really not, again, nothing was there. It was anew camp. There were\nonly...well one building was fully completed. One building they just started, I\u2019m not sure they\neven started it. But by a building I mean a...it was a block. One block that kept prisoners. And\nagain, the toilet was a slit with a roof on top. In there we didn\u2019t even have water. There was no\nwater inside the camp. To get the water we had to go outside the camp. [break] There was no\nwater being brought. Water had to be brought in. That camp was [break] the heat consisted of\npotbelly stoves, except they didn\u2019t give us any wood. The last time we had been given\nunderwear was sometime in August. And by that time it was November. So our underwear was\nprobably torn to pieces. It was full of lice. We had no shoes anymore. The shoes were wooden\nshoes and the straps were gone. There was no nails to fix them. There was no soap. Nothing to\nwash...there was no...there were no basics. The best way to describe the camp is\u2014look around.\nSee what it is you can\u2019t live without and then say to yourself, well we didn\u2019t have that. There\nwas a doctor and he had probably some basic pills. There was also one room reserved for sick\npeople. The death rate was very high. It was an awful camp. We worked there on building a\nlanding strip for German planes. I believe that\u2019s what it was. But in the meantime I learned one\nway to supplement the food and not to die of hunger. Most of the people of course were dying of\nhunger. Hunger was probably the biggest cause of death...was to try to get outside the camp and\nget some food. So I did that. And especially on Thursday (?), I learned how to run away. I\nremember the first time I run away actually I stole a [933]. I\nfound myself as working in the fields and dewheating [ph, 938] the fields. The grass was very\nhigh and we were laying deep in the grass and the guards were front and behind us and I was\nfalling behind the column of people. I looked up and I was like 50 feet behind them. And I had\na choice of either trying to catch up with them and I knew if I do that, [944] would see me",
        "and beat me up. I turn around and go the other way. And I decided to go the other way. And I\ndid, went the other way I started turning around and running away and I did, I crawled away and\nsuccessfully and first thing I did was go into a farmer\u2019s barn and find some vegetables and got\nsome of the vegetables but then I have to make a decision. What do I do? I was outside of the\ncamp, there was really no place to go. I couldn\u2019t go back to Poland. I couldn\u2019t be in Germany.\nThere was nobody that I trust in Germany. I knew if they find out that I escaped they could\nprobably harm my father and brothers. So I crawled back.\nAnthony: You snuck back into the camp?\nIrving: I snuck back into the labor brigade. And brought home the vegetables. It helped us and\nWe...\nAnthony: What did you manage to get? Do you remember?\nIrving: I think I got some carrots and some garlic from that first time. Unterriexingen and I did\nthis several times. But one time, I will tell you this so that we can make this a little shorter. One\ntime, I went into a farm to a...the German farmers used to store and supply their food outside in\nthe storage sheds. They never even closed the storage sheds, they would put a branch into the\nstorage shed just to keep it closed. It was easy enough to open it up. And so I wandered to that\nfarm and opened up the storage shed and that storage shed was full of potatoes, carrots, and all\nkind of what were to me goodies.\nAnthony: Right.\nIrving: And I started loading up some of that and all of a sudden I felt this thing in the back of\nmy back. It turned out to be a gun. And a lady\u2019s voice says to me, [979], \u201cPut up\nyour arms.\u201d I put up my arms and she says turn around. I turn around and she looks at me and\nsays, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re only a baby, you\u2019re only a boy.\u201d Now we started talking and I told her\nthat I\u2019m...I was only seventeen years old.\nAnthony: Right.\nIrving: I told her I\u2019m hungry, I don\u2019t want anything else. I just want some food, that\u2019s all. And\nshe looked at me for a while and she said, \u201cYou know something,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re very short on",
        "potatoes,\u201d and closed the door and left. So I took some of the stuff and went out. Now I went\nback to that shed a couple more times. I know one time that I went back, I saw her in the\nwindow. She saw me go in. I think she waved, I\u2019m not sure. But she didn\u2019t say anything.\nAnthony: Now, this was in the second, this was in Unterriexingen. What direction was\n[995]?\nIrving: One day...\nAnthony: This was a farm that was not far from the camp?\nIrving: Right, not far from the camp. It wasn\u2019t a big farm, it wasn\u2019t a farm like you might have\nhere, a farm with several acres, just a small farm. One day, I remember that well, I went into that\nshed and the door opened and she came in and she said I want you to come into the kitchen. And\nshe went in first and I followed her. I went into the kitchen, I sat there and she gave me a lot of\nfood and she gave me all kinds of cookies. And she even gave me a drink of wine. She wanted\nto know if I knew what day this 1s. I didn\u2019t know, but it had to be the day before Christmas and\nin 1944. While I was there it started snowing and on cloudy day [ph] and snow, it snowed very\nhard and uh she told me that she cook for the guards. The guards told her that the only people\nthat are in this camp are political prisoners who are against the German Reich and I told her this\nisn\u2019t true. How can I be a political prisoner, I was twelve years old. What did I have to do with\npolitics? She uh... I sat there for a while then I left but you realize that I walked around\nbarefooted and the snow was high by that time. It was very difficult for me to get back. By the\ntime I get back, it was too late for lunch. I got back, it was past twelve o\u2019clock and the group\napparently was already assembled and they knew that I was missing. In fact, they had sent\nguards out looking for me. I knew I\u2019m in trouble.\nAnthony: Right.\nIrving: I put stuff away that she gave me. I tried to preserve it. I just left a couple of apples in\nthere and I waited till they came back from working. I mixed in them, you couldn\u2019t see me. But\nthey immediately knew who it was because there were only one or two who used to run away.\nAnthony: Right.",
        "Irving: They beat me up pretty well. And they tried to tell...they wanted me to tell them where I\nwent, what I did. I kept telling them that I went to the airfield and that they gave me some\napples. I knew they weren\u2019t going to do anything to the German fliers. Then in the evening they\nput me at the end of the column when they march back to the camp. Now two weeks before\nthen, they, there were two Poles but I left out that. Meanwhile, some Poles came in to camp...a\ncouple hundred Poles.\nAnthony: They were just...they were not Jews? They were just Poles?\nIrving: They were just Poles. Two of these Poles escaped and they caught them and the\npunishment was that, after they caught them, they exposed them overnight, they were kneeling\nwith their hands up, all night. In the morning they were frozen. So, when the column went in\nthey made me do the same thing, kneel with my hands up and I was sitting there. I didn\u2019t know\nwhat they were going to do with me. I knew I was going to get some punishment but I didn\u2019t\nknow what type of punishment.\nAnthony: This was already after they had beaten you?\nIrving: After, yeah. And uh it got to be very late at night. A guy who worked for them, who\ncleaned up their SS guards\u2019 barracks came out and I asked him what they were going to do and\nhe said they decided to shoot me. I thought this might be right. And then finally they came out,\ntwo or three of them; I don\u2019t remember how many came over and they said, well, they said we\ndecided to commute the sentence.\nAnthony: These were the SS guards?\nIrving: Yeah, they weren\u2019t SS. They were guards but they weren\u2019t SS. In fact, the one that said\nthat was actually a member of the German air force but he was a guard. He said, \u201cYou know, we\njust won a great victory.\u201d Now that had to be the Battle of the Bulge, you know that now, I didn\u2019t\nknow that. He said, \u2019You know we just have to win a great victory. We\u2019re going to need people\nlike, slaves like you because the German Reich is going to want, is going to rule the whole\nworld. So we commuted your sentence. Instead of executing you, you\u2019re going to get fifty\nlashes.\u201d That\u2019s what I got, I got fifty lashes. And then they throwed me into a, what do you call\nit, hydrolation [ph] (c. 053).\nAnthony: Solitary confinement.",
        "Irving: And actually there were two other guys in that solitary confinement. One Pole and one\nJew. The Pole was released about fifteen minutes after I got in there. The other guy, I remember\nabout midnight the Germans would sit here, organize, and they broke several bones. Well they\nheal, you can\u2019t see it now. I take x-rays down at the doctors keep asking me have I ever had a\nbig accident. I got lots of broken bones.\nAnthony: That\u2019s when they beat you, that\u2019s what happened.\nIrving: I think the fact that I was frozen helped me. The pain wasn\u2019t so bad. Well that\u2019s what\nhappened that Christmas night, Christmas Eve. Shortly after, because of that night I guess, I got\npneumonia. They kept me in the hospital about ten days and after I got out of the hospital they\nput me right to work. They made me, made me carry a load of bricks. I couldn\u2019t carry it. I was\ntoo weak, I was just out of the hospital. So I dropped it. Because of that they threw me in\nsolitary confinement again. When they left me out of that solitary confinement, they were\nevacuating the camp. And all of a sudden everybody else in the second barracks (long pause)\nand I found my father there and my other two, my two brothers were too sick. So the sick people\nwere sent back to Vaihingen an der Enz and all the people who were not sick enough was sent\nout to camp Kochendorf. There were very few left, very few. Most, a lot of people died. There\nwere, the rate of death was like four or five a day. A lot of the Poles died. I don\u2019t know how\nmany Poles survived but very few...there were several hundred. Most of them died.\nWhen we arrived in Kochendorf, again we went through a procedure of trying to get washed.\nThe way we were going to get clean is they kept us out it was winter, it was January, I\u2019m sure it\nwas January. It was cold and on Sunday and we were being kept outside and inside they had a\nbig tub of water, which was being warmed on one of the potbellied stoves. They filled it up with\nwarm water, and four or five guys would get into that tub and wash themselves. After the first\nguy, that tub was as dark as the ground. We didn\u2019t take a bath in eight months, five months or\nsomething. August to January, five months, four months. So after that there were no towels\neither. Then you went to that around the potbellied stove and waited there until you dried.\nMeanwhile, they took your clothes, whatever clothes you had and they sent us to the steamer.\nWhen it came out the steamer they were all wet and you put it on. They send you outside then\nyou waited till everybody was ready. Which means you waited outside for two or three hours.\nThis procedure, I just got through pneumonia, with this procedure, by the time I got to the\nbarracks, I was pretty sick. Now there we had a guy, the guy who was heading that barracks, his\nname was Teddy. He is a Pole too. And he was pretty tough. He was one of the toughest guys.\nHe really beat us up pretty badly, beat up some guys. People were very scared of him. But he\ngive us a lecture, he said, \u201ctomorrow you can go and see a doctor if you don\u2019t feel good. But if\nyou have a 104, he\u2019Il send you to the hospital. If you don\u2019t have a 104, he\u2019Il send you back here.\nI guarantee if you get back here, Pll kill you.\u201d And he meant it. But I went anyhow, I felt bad,",
        "so I went to see a doctor. And when, when I walked in he asked me what\u2019s wrong with me, first\nhe took my temperature and I must have had high temperature. He took my temperature and\nasked me what\u2019s wrong with me. I said I just had pneumonia. But the German word for\npneumonia is lung infection (Lungenentzundung). That\u2019s what I told him. And so he put me in\nthe hospital, first in a hospital in Kochendorf. I was warm and I was in bed. I was in that bed till\nabout ten o\u2019clock. They came in and took temperature again. And then the guy came in and told\nme to get up and follow him. And now I thought, well they\u2019re going to take me right back to\nTeddy and this is it. And they took me like halfway to the barracks and that\u2019s all I know about\nKochendorf is the hospital to Teddy and then all of a sudden he turned to the left and I saw a\nstructure, which I\u2019ve never seen in a camp before. There was a building, barracks, if you like,\nthat was all fenced in, inside the camp. The camp itself as fenced. That other building was\nfenced in inside and we went to that building. The guy went as far as the fence and said\nsomething in a different language. Somebody came out, opened the fence, pushed me in and\nthat\u2019s it and they closed the fence.\nAll of a sudden I asked what this is, where am I? They told me this is a TB hospital. I was ina\nTB hospital. It\u2019s the only one of a kind that I know of and it was all fenced in and nobody could\nget to it. I don\u2019t know how many people there were in there. There was a room full of people.\nThey were all Hungarian mostly Hungarian. I couldn\u2019t understand most of the people unless\nthey spoke my language, either German or Yiddish, then I understood. If they wanted me to\nunderstand this otherwise, they spoke Hungarian. But they treated me very well and I actually\nrecovered in that place. The only problem is if you\u2019re talking about a place with no way out,\nthat\u2019s a place with no way out. There\u2019s no reason why the Germans would maintain a TB\nhospital inside a concentration camp. And I stayed in that hospital till the middle of March, till\nthe end of March. Nothing much happened. Just stayed in that hospital, nobody ever came\nthere, nobody came to the door.\nAnthony: Were the doctors inside?\nIrving: Same doctor that let me in. He came...\nAnthony: And he never left either?\nIrving: Well, no. He would go in and out. He came in and he would go over to some people\nwho didn\u2019t feel well or once in a while would ask me how I feel. They would take temperatures\ntwice a day and keep a record of it. Oh, I asked him to please take my father into the hospital,\nregular hospital and he promised he would and I think he did. Why, I have no idea, but he\npromised.",
        "Anthony: Was he, was the doctor a German?\nIrving: No. He was a Hungarian Jew.\nAnthony: He was Hungarian also?\nIrving: His name was Doctor Weiss. Ahh, he was a very gentle person. I don\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have\nany problems with him. And, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he was very well liked. No problems. He\nwould come in and visit and talk and probably be our only link to the outside world. He would\ngo out and come in and that\u2019s it. But nobody else would...they would bring in food, take it back\nand that\u2019s it. Then one day...\nTape 2: [unable to verify, Tape 2 inaudible]\nIrving: And what happen is the people who were in the hospital went by freight and the people\nwho were not in the hospital walked. And the whole camp was evacuated to go to Dachau.\nNow, from what I understand, now, this is from a quarterback position, which we didn\u2019t know at\nthe time. Teddy said that he once, he was going to try to run away or escape. He was walking\nwith the people. And apparently, if there was any food, it isn\u2019t a long ride from where we were.\nKochendorf is somewhere and near [013] something like that and Dachau. Today maybe\nit\u2019s a ride of two hours, two and a half, three hours. But there might have been some food they\ngave us, it was the war time. And [016] from what I understand, Teddy might have taken\nthat food from us, from the sick people. In any case, they locked the [017] sometimes in\nthe afternoons. This was Tuesday afternoon. The train started moving. It moved all day\nTuesday, all night Tuesday night. Wednesday morning they opened the doors and they asked if\nthere are any people dead. There was four or five people dead. So we handed them out and they\ntook them out. And they buried them. I know the name of the town was Aalen. I remember\nthat. And we traveled all day Wednesday, all night Wednesday. On Thursday morning, the\nsame procedure. However, no food, no water. They just came and took the dead out. Thursday,\nsometimes during the day, we got into an air raid. I don\u2019t know what planes, could have been\nEnglish, could have been American. [028] I mean we were all locked in. we could hear\nbombs, we could hear sirens. We could smell fire around us. We weren\u2019t hit. The guards were\nrunning all over. And then they came back. We were praying that we would be hit so we could\nget out...and we weren\u2019t. Again, nothing happened. Thursday night, we traveled again all\nnight. Friday morning they opened the freight train and took more dead out. By that time we\ncouldn\u2019t give them the dead anymore. We didn\u2019t have the strength to give the dead. By that\ntime there were very few people in the car who were still alive. On Saturday morning, they came",
        "aboard to take the dead out. We finally arrive from Dachau Saturday night. No food, no water.\nThen when we arrived, then two prisoners of Dachau came out, aboard the freight train. They\ntook us down and lined us, five people in a row and put our hands into the pockets and one guy\nwould put his arm around one end of the five people, the other around the other five, and pick us\nup and took us in like this. That\u2019s how strong we weren\u2019t, just couldn\u2019t stand on our feet. How\nmany people survived, I don\u2019t know. Very few, maybe ten percent. When we finally got into\nDachau, it was late at night and we begged them to give us something to drink. Give us some\ncoffee, give us something to eat. They said the kitchen 1s closed, can\u2019t give us anything to eat.\nFinally, after we begged them, they brought us some water. It was late Saturday night, just got a\ndrink of water, no food.\nAnthony: And that was the first time you had water since you got on the train?\nIrving: Yeah, just Tuesday night. I was crawling on the floor. I was crawling around, crawling\non all four, couldn\u2019t walk. All of a sudden I saw a familiar face. It was my father. He survived\ntoo. He was in that transport. And on Sunday morning in Dachau there were showers, there\nwere showers in Dachau. And then they made us take a shower, so the first few people who\nwent together to shower, I don\u2019t know why, but they turned the hot water on. And as soon as the\npeople got in the shower, they died, they just fell down and died. I don\u2019t know whether the hot\nwater did it or what.\nAnthony: It shocked them or something like that.\nIrving: Just died. And we refused to go on then and they changed it. They changed the hot\nwater to a less hot, cool. Then we got past this, and it turned out that this was April the first,\nEaster Sunday. And on Easter Sunday we always figured maybe we\u2019ll get\u2014if we don\u2019t get the\ncoffee on Sunday morning, at least we\u2019re going to get the soup at noon because every\nconcentration camp\u2014but it turned out this was Easter Sunday, April the first, 1944 and one day\nin the year and only in Dachau on Easter Sunday they did not give that soup. All they did is give\na piece of bread and a slice of salami. That\u2019s the only time we ever got a slice of salami in camp\nbut they didn\u2019t give it till 4pm on that day. So the first time we got a piece of bread, at 4pm on\nthat Sunday. After we got into the block in Dachau. That\u2019s how we got to Dachau. We stayed\nin Dachau from April the first till late in April. Dachau was to me compared to Unterriexingen\nand Vaihingen and Kochendorf, although I didn\u2019t see Kochendorf. But from what I understand\nvery few people survived Kochendorf. Very few people who went with to Kochendorf survived.\nDachau, compared with these camps, was a luxury because it had showers, it had water. There\nwas a Red Cross and they brought packages. My father used to wear glasses. He broke his\nglasses and one day he went down to the toilet and he hit himself on the bed on his leg and it\nwouldn\u2019t heal. It started to get worse and worse, almost greenish like. They wouldn\u2019t put him in",
        "the hospital but then by the end of April they announced that there\u2019ll be a Red Cross inspection.\nSo when the Red Cross guy came him we pushed him out in front so the Red Cross guy could\nsee him and when he saw what happened to his foot he told the guy who was in charge of the\nblock to put him in the hospital. So my father was designated the next day to go in the hospital.\nAt the same time the next day they decided to evacuate all the Jews from Dachau. So when my\nfather went to the hospital in Dachau, I got evacuated.\nAnthony: So you got separated.\nIrving: We got separated. He went to the hospital and I went on a train.\nAnthony: This was the end of April in 1945?\nIrving: End of April in 1945. Don\u2019t know exactly what day in April but towards the end of\nApril in 1945. This time it was a passenger train, not a freight train. We got a passenger train in\nDachau.\nAnthony: You got seats and everything?\nIrving: Seats. We got a package before we got on the train, a food package from Red Cross. I\nhappened to get a Belgian package. Other people got other packages. That was a food package.\nI don\u2019t know why they put us on the train and where they were taking us. I still don\u2019t know. It\u2019s\nstill a mystery. But we took off from Dachau and went all the way to the Austrian border to a\nsmall town in Tirol called Zeaphant [ph92]. We stopped right before that town. We started\nwalking up the mountain. When we walked up the mountain a man who looked to me like he\nwas the mayor of Zeaphant [ph100], I don\u2019t know maybe not, but an official in either case,\nstopped us and said that Austria is no longer at war and as far as he\u2019s concerned we are no longer\nprisoners; the war is over and we should be free, except since Austria didn\u2019t do anything to us he\ncannot feed us. We got to go back to Germany but the SS were still there with the rifles and the\nmachine guns. Apparently he had a long conference with the SS men. So they kept us overnight\nstill under SS guard despite the fact of what he said in a barn in the mountains in Tyrol. The next\nmorning they took us back over to Germany. There they put us into a ravine between two\nmountaintops, set up machine guns on both ends and there we were. I don\u2019t know what they\nintended to do. There were machine guns. There was a whole story about it that there were\nsome women who came over and told them that if they shoot us they going to be punished or\nsomething or other. I didn\u2019t see that. I was mostly with some of my Hungarian friends from\nKochendorf and so on. It was late in the evening, towards the evening, I don\u2019t know whether it",
        "was late or dark when one of them woke me up and said look, what we saw 1s that the SS is\nchanging into civilian uniforms. The SS was changing into civilian uniforms and disappeared.\nAnthony: Just leaving.\nIrving: Yeah. The next thing I know is Peel\u2019s [ph123] following them and going on the road\nand I followed him. There were others crowding. There were lots of people walking. This is the\nEleburna [ph125] Pass, by the way. There were lots of people walking into Germany. I just\njoined them, prison uniform and all. Barefoot, no shoes, prison uniform. I don\u2019t know if the\nmoon is on or not. I can\u2019t tell you but the guy next to me, he\u2019s either Italian or Hungarian, not\nGerman, but he spoke to me. I just shook my head. We walked all the way into the town and as\nsoon as we got into the town the first street I saw I just disappeared, ran into the first street. And\nthere I started looking for an empty house. Saw a house which looked empty and I started\ngetting in. I went to the basement but it wasn\u2019t empty. A guy came out with a rifle and started\nmaking noises and all these foreigners what are you doing in here. Who is this? I said very\nquietly and then he went back. I went to the next house and finally found an empty house\u2014got\nin there. And there were three other Hungarians in there. The four of us spent the night in that\nhouse. The next morning there was somebody on the street told us in Hungarian that there is a\ntrainload full of sugar at the station, that people are going down there for sugar. So I went down\nthere too. And there were a lot of Germans picking up sugar from that train. I didn\u2019t need the\nsugar but I was looking around. And there was a German lady and she said to me she wants help\nwith the sugar. At that time I was getting very sick, absolutely sick. I couldn\u2019t eat anymore.\nThe thing that I needed most was sleep. All I wanted to do was sleep. So I told her that I will\nhelp her with the sugar if she lets me sleep in her house. And she agreed so I helped her with the\nsugar and we took it to her house and she let me sleep under the steps in that house until about\u2014\nin the afternoon, maybe two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, something like that. And then she came\nrunning in and she said the SS is running around and she\u2019s afraid and I\u2019d better get out. So I left.\nI had no place to go so I sat down on a bench, a town bench and I was sitting there. I couldn\u2019t go\nany further. I was sick. I was very sick. Sitting there, a man came over in a uniform. Turned\nout the town mailman, the town mailman, and he came over and he said you can\u2019t sit here. If\nyou sit here they\u2019re going to shoot you and the Americans are coming in tomorrow and because\nof that they\u2019re going to punish the whole town. He said, \u201cYou come with me and I\u2019Il hide you.\u201d\nSo I went with him. He put me in the garage and I sat in the mail truck all night. The Americans\ncame in that night, sometime during the night. In the morning he came in and said, \u201cNow you\ncan come up to my apartment.\u201d I went up to his apartment, asked me what I want to do and I said\nall I want to do and I said all I want to do is lay down and sleep. So he let me sleep in a bed in\nhis hallway. The first thing I hit the bed I fell asleep as far as I know. The next thing I know 1s\nsomebody is standing on top of me and shaking me and shaking me, and a woman screaming,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t die here, you can\u2019t die here!\u201d They were both standing in front of me and saying that,\n\u201cYou have to go to a hospital, you can\u2019t die in here.\u201d That time they felt that I was dying. So\nthey gave me a pair of pants and I put them on and I started crossing... They showed me where",
        "the hospital is across the street. I started crossing the street, went to the hospital. The hospital\nwas in a school, in a former school. It had three steps. I had a hell of a time getting up those\nthree steps. But I finally made it. I got up the steps. I got up to the hospital, went in. There was\na doctor who was an officer, a German officer. First thing he did is stuck me with a\nthermometer. I didn\u2019t have any temperature. Already told me that he cannot accept civilian. I\ntold him I\u2019m not sick, I\u2019m starving. I\u2019m dying of starvation. I need help. So I have to go toa\ncivilian hospital. So walking outside I fell down the steps. And I lay in the street; I just lay\nthere, I couldn\u2019t get up. And a jeep came by. A jeep stopped. A guy came out, picked me up,\nput me in the back of the jeep, took me to American headquarters. Two guys came out; one\nspoke Yiddish, one spoke Polish. They took me back to the hospital, went back to the doctor.\nOne of the guys took out a gun. He had a gun; he must have been an officer. Took out the gun,\nwent over to the German doctor and said to him in kind of a semi-broken German, he said to\nhim, \u201cYou know, he dies, you die.\u201d And after that he put me in a bed, gave me IV. I was in that\nhospital until the middle of June.\nAnthony: And this was in early May?\nIrving: Yeah, in the middle of Germany in a military hospital. It was a German military hospital\nin Mittenwald [187]. It was a place called Mittenwald in Germany. And that\u2019s where I was\nwhen the war ended.\nAnthony: What did you do after the war?\nIrving: I spent several years in a displaced person camp in Stuttgart. I went back to Munich and\ngot a high school diploma. I took an exam and got a high school diploma. I went for a short\ntime to a Polish university, Polytechnic, then I switched over to the German Polytechnic and then\nI left for the United States.\nAnthony: Do you remember what year that was?\nIrving: 1948; January 1948 I came to the United States and by now I work as an engineer and\ndesign naval combat systems.\nAnthony: That\u2019s great.",
        "Irving: And I do have several degrees now. I did continue my education.\nAnthony: Did you find Poland and Germany different after the war or was it the same attitude\ntowards Jews?\nIrving: I never went back. Germany yeah, Poland I never went back. I was in Germany after\nthe war. I spent three years in Germany; 1945 to 1948. Did I find it different? Yeah, I guess. I\nguess it is different.\nAnthony: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say?\nIrving: Well, now you\u2019ve got the story of my life until today. Right now I\u2019m happy I\u2019m in the\nUnited States. In fact, I spent two years in the U.S. Army.\nAnthony: When were you in the army?\nIrving: From 1950 to 1952.\nAnthony: Well, I think we\u2019re all done.\nIrving: Okay, fine.",
