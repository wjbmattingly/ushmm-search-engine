        "Q: I would like to begin by asking you to tell me your full name.",
        "A: Helen H. Waterford.",
        "Q: What was your date of birth?",
        "A: April 14th, 1909.",
        "Q: And where were you born, Helen?",
        "A: In Germany.",
        "Q: Helen, tell me about your childhood? Can we talk about that for awhile?",
        "A: Sure. My...I was born in a...in a smaller town across the river from Frankfurt on the Rhine.\nAnd when I was about 3 or 4 years old, my parents moved to Frankfurt. It was very\nunfortunate that, uh, my father was born in Lithuania and had difficulty to get permission to\nstay in Germany in Offenbach. I do not know why. I only know that we had to move to\nFrankfurt. 1914, the first World War started. I was 5 years old and the laws in Germany are\nstill the same, that the wife and the offspring takes the, uh, well, is is the same citizen of a\ncountry as a father. So my mother, who was German...her family was there for\ncenturies....and I, we became all of a sudden Russians because Lithuania belonged to Russia\nat the time. And as Russians, we were the enemies of Germany, and we would have been\ninterned if we couldn't live with my grandparents who at this time came from a very small\ntown in Germany...1n Germany. They're quite old. We thought at that time old. And, uh, my\naunt, my mother's sister, had taken them tn into their building and so we shared their\nquarters. And we were not register...registered at the police which meant like living\nunderground, illegally. All this naturally was not told to me. I was much too small to\nunderstand that, but I do know that when I was 6 years old, I was supposed to go to school,\nand it was not possible to go to a public school because my citizenship was Russian. And,\nuh, there was a Jewish school, an excellent Jewish school, liberal, and my mother talked to\nthe director and he understood and let me come in without birth certificate or whatever. That\nwas the school I started when I was 6. It was absolutely a fantastic school as I found out later\nin the years. And, um, it was so broad-minded and we learned so, so...everything so much,\nuh, so directly, so uh intensively. The school was in two buildings and were connected. One\nwere girls and one were boys. And, uh, it did not happen before we were maybe 13 or 14 that\nwe were brought together with the boys. Even some of them naturally one had already seen,\nand, eh, in between the hours, but boys and girls in the same class at the same age were taken\nby the teachers to outings, which I thought was a very good idea and everybody liked it. Uh,\nI was in this school until I was 18 years old. Because when I was 16 and I thought it was the\nend, they added the three classes that you could go in there if you wanted to go to the\nuniversity...you wanted to go on. That's what I did.",
        "Q: Helen, what was it like growing up as a Jewish child?",
        "A: I couldn't tell you, because I thought everybody was Jewish. In some way I was not aware\nthat the children I was playing on the streets with were neighbors that they were not Jewish,\nbecause all the children I knew were Jewish. Frankfurt is a big city and, uh, was a big city at\nthat time too. It...I was... was thinking I was living in a Jewish world. We were not that very\nreligious. We were liberals, as it was called in Germany. And my parents went to the high\nholidays to the synagogue. We didn't live far from synagogue and, uh, there was no Sunday\nschool because most of the things we had in school. We had very little Hebrew lessons, but\nwe did uh have the Rabbi teaching us the history of the Jews.",
        "Q: I understand you were married in 1933?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Would you tell me about your husband and the circumstances of your marriage?",
        "A: Oh, I... In 1933, I got married. I met...I met him the year before, but I, uh, I had..I had to\nwork uh besides going to school, to finance it. There were no loans at this time, and my\nparents were not that happily financially to afford that. And I, 1t came out, I made very good\nmoney, so I was in a situation to support myself and help my parents. So I decided I wouldn't\nget married. Why should I get married? I saw no reasons. And, uh...I had a boyfriend\nbecause just everybody had to have a boyfriend. It was the, uh, style. But, uh, all of a\nsudden...I had known him from school as I said in this school where we were. The school's\nname is Philanthropin, 1f somebody would ever hear that. Phianthropin was unique and, um,\nit was a shame that it didn't never come back in any shape or form. Uh...I decided I didn't\nwant to get married. After he did not want to get married to me, so I was jilted...and the sour\ngrapes, were I don't get married. And I could travel, and I was traveling to, um, um, to the\nseashore. There was an island\u2019 where most of the people who came there in summer were\nJewish because the next island did not allow Jews. So the Jews had their own places, and so\nthat's where I went. And on the second day I was there, I met the man I married later.\u201d I did\nnot want even to talk to him because he thought...he looked as if he was 18 years old. I was\n23 already. I was absolutely not interested, but he was very persistent and I found out that he\nwas 28 so that made things a little easier. (laughs) And he came also from Frankfurt. So we\ngot married after Hitler took power, which was in January 30th, 1933. He had lost already\nhis job and we...but I still had my income, and we got married with the intention to leave the\ncountry. We were married by the way by the Orthodox Rabbi who married my parents and\nhis parents. And, um, we left Germany in 1934 going to Holland.\nNorderney, one of the German Frisian islands in the North Sea.\n* Siegfried Wohlfarth.",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: Now, the trip to Holland...the preparations of leaving Germany at that time so very early was\na little different than it became later. We could took take everything with us. And he had a\njob there. He was a CPA. He had gotten a job there. I couldn't work there - didn't get any\npermit, being not Dutch. And, uh, I tried to learn the language which is um not so easy. It is\nmore of a throat thickness, it seemed to me, than a language. I got used to it because I wanted\nto speak it. I wanted to make friends, and I had nothing to do. I started without really, uh,\nthinking about - it a business. I. . .Now, at first I have to say I got pregnant, and we found\nout that we would have a very hard time to live on the salary he had and ...with a child you\nknow. So I want...I had to think of something...how to make some money to make it easier.\nSo I was helping the people who moved to Holland from Germany to settle down and I did\neverything they would need to uh find a place to live, to furnish the place, because they\nhad...mostly couldn't bring much furniture anymore. I wanted to make it easier for them, and\nI wanted to make some money on it. Which I did. It developed later in a. . into..an interior\ndecorator business and the people I had as customers before told it to other people, and it\nwas very successful. But that was 37, that's when my daughter was born. Then, in 1938,\ncame the uh the night of the broken glass, on November 9th, and, uh, my mother called from\nFrankfurt and told me that my father and my brother were arrested and uh, what we could\ndo. Now my father had been arrested a few months before, and we got him a visa to come to\nHolland. It was very difficult, but when he had the visa he did decide not to go. He was\nconvinced without any...he couldn't yet even say why...that uh 1t would be over soon, and\nthere was no reason for him to leave Germany. So he stayed. My brother was 18 years old\nand, uh, he was arrested. And he came to Buchenwald. But when my father was arrested, the\nman who looked at his passport, the stateless one, and he saw he had a visa to come to\nHolland and he said to him, \"You're an idiot that you stayed here. I'll take your passport. I'll\nmeet you tomorrow morning on the train to Amsterdam.\" And this my mother told me that\nhe was coming the next day. My brother and my brother-in-law, my husband's brother, we\nall got them out to Holland or to England, where we had relatives and we couldn't go. And\nthe the invasion came to Holland, which was in May of 1940, my parents, all of them, all of\nthis family, was already in the United States. And we had no chance! My father, as uh the\nman from, you know, from Russia, he uh could have...he could come into the United States\non a visa from this part because at that time there was nobody using a visa to go to the\nUnited States. If they would have had to wait for a German visa, I mean German bek, they\nwould have never made it because the United States did not give all the visas they legally\nwere obliged and was as possible to give, but they only gave half or less. So...so I...this way\nmy father, my mother, and my brother got into the United States.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Where? What? What I did do at what time?",
        "Q: When you were in Holland at that time.",
        "A: No. I don't..I never got...I told you I was working as an interior decorator.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And that was over the moment Hitler came. Nothing doing. Hoping that we would get out,\nbut which was not possible. So we, uh...we were waiting what the Nazis were doing. My\nhusband had just lost his job right away, and our child was three years old when the Nazis\ncame and was five years old when we got the order to um appear at the train station in\nAmsterdam at 1:30 at night to allow us to bring one suitcase a person and the key to the\nhouse. This was a. . .a strange order. We didn't understand what really would happen to us,\nand all our friends came and we gathered in the house and talked- \"What shall we do?\" All\nthe same age. We were five couples. We all had come from Germany, and each of us had a\nlittle girl about the same age. From all those people, all those couples with each one child,\nthe only one who came back...the only ones who were alive was one man, was my daughter\nand me. We lost them all. And, uh, we...my husband and I, we decided we go to the Jewish\nCouncil. I assume you are familiar with what the Jewish Council was in each city. So in\nAmsterdam was a very large Jewish Council and we bought our order and asked, \"What is\nthis? Where are we going? What does it mean?\" And we were...we were not the only ones\nwho came. Everybody was confused. And uh we were told that we were going to a family\ncamp to work and that we should take our children. We hadn't asked about children, but they\nsaid, \"Take your children because they will be taken care of while you work.\" We left this\nbuilding and I decided to tell my husband that I am not for going on the July 15th to get that\ntrain. And we, being brought up in Germany, which is a little different than other countries\num had a hard time to accept that. My husband said, \"We cannot do that. This is an order,\nblack and white. Who knows what they will do to us if we don't go?\" I said, \"Who knows\nwhat they do to us when we are going? We don't know. We don't know where we are going.\nAnd why? Because Jewish, but (cough) what other reason?\" So we decided that my husband\nshould get a surgery to give us some time. And he found a willing doctor to take out (cough,\ncough.) excuse me...to take out his appendix which was very healthy. So we got two weeks\nthat he could recover and then we would be getting another order. In those two weeks I've\nheard that everybody who is working in any capacity for the Jewish Council would get a\nstamp and a paper that they are at this moment free of deport. . .deportation and so I got a job\nas a cook in an old people's home. I worked there from 7 in the morning. I cooked for\neverybody. There were 40 people there. And I...if...1f. . they paid me five-something like\nfive dollars a week it was a lot. Anyway, I worked there.. I worked there maybe six weeks. I.\n. . really can't say. In the meantime, my husband had recovered and uh still we did need\nsomebody at home that my daughter was not even 5 years old. Somebody had to be there\nsince I was practically gone all the time, and, uh, the day I came...I came one morning and\nthe doors were open, and the whole place was in a terrible condition and everybody was\ngone, and most of them were on stretchers. It was a weary feeling. The people were all\nfinancially in a very good shape. I don't know what was lying around or so or what they\ntook. I run out of the house because I thought, \"Maybe there's some of those guys left, and\nthen they'll take me.\" And they were all gone. So then I was sure, it was not work we were\nsent to when they take those old people. But we had no other way to go any place because\nwe were not allowed to be on the street at night. We had to wear. . wear our star. We uh\ncould not take public transportation. We had to walk wherever we were going in this big\ncity. We, uh, had special hours of purchasing our food. Everything was very, very difficult so\nyou had no telephone any more. You had no connection. You just...that's a feeling...so we\nstay home and they will probably pick us up. That's all we can do. In...",
        "Q: Helen, would you like to take some water?",
        "A: Ja. Maybe. (drinks water) Ja. Early October, 1942, a very close friend of ours, we knew him\nfor many years and, was a neighbor and, was one of those couples. This was a man who\nlived through it. He came and he said...he was married to a school friend of mine. I got them\ntogether. It was wonderful. So he said that he had somebody who was helping them to live\nunderground and their child would be in a different place if we would like to consider that.\nNaturally, we said...and though...and the next day this man came to us. His name was Joe\nVis. He is the...the Gentile who is named with all the others who were helping me in my\nbook. It's really written for them. He [Jo] came and said that they were all blue collar\nworkers and they belonged to uh a very liberal small church. They didn't have much money,\nbut they wanted to help as much as they could and they said, \"It is easier 1f you are not\ntogether with your child, because she cannot stay inside what you have to do. We do not\nknow how long the war will be. We have a place for a child if you want to give her up. I\nwould suggest you do.\" We certainly agreed, and a few days later he came back with a\ncouple.\u2019 We did not know their name and we did not know where they were living. We\nfound out after the war that this woman was his sister, but we didn't know. And they came\nSunday afternoon and we walked together to the street car with my daughter and gave it to\nher...to them. And, uh, we...this man, Joe Vis, he had the days before already with his wife\neveryday picked up things for Doris, my daughter, toys, her bed, her doll house...was there\nwaiting for her, and, uh, he said, \"Maybe in a few weeks we will have something for you too.\nIt's more difficult to get two people a home again.\" So...he...but he got it. About three or four\nweeks later he came and he had a place\u201d and we, uh, he uh...we had two metal beds, so he\ntook those two and brought it where we were going because the people had no beds for us.\nAnd some pillow cases and so on. But I have to say in 1941, one year before, my husband\nwho was very far thinking had said, \"You know, we should prepare our child that she's not\ndepending on us. We don't know - maybe there will be a transport for children to the United\nStates, which never happened because United States did not take the 20,000 children they\nwant to send. Or to England. We should be uh less warm with her, that she will never miss\nus. No hugging, no kissing. But she should be...it should be easier for her not to miss us. And\n* Joe Vis and his wife, Agaat, were instrumental in aiding Helen and Sigfried.\n* Dirk and Stien DeBoers.\n> In Zaandam, an industrial town located just outside Amsterdam.\nthat's what we started, a year before. Also, another friend\u2019 took from our house things we\nthought maybe we should put away. He offered it. And we gave him all our books. It was the\nmost important thing. And the typewriter. But also silver and clothes and bed sheets and\nshoes and all those things. We had no idea what he would do with it. We did not ask. And uh\nso when when we left the house and to go into this illegal place there was furniture and all\nthat was there. And we very optimistic. We even paid the rent for this apartment until we\nfound out that the Germans had emptied it completely, which was maybe eight months after\nthat. And, uh, the, uh...this man who took all our things, we had a contract with him that he\nhad bought our furniture and that he had paid us so much for the furniture that and he got a\nreceipt from the Germans that they had taken out the furniture that belonged to him, and\nwhen the war was over, he got the money.\u2019 He'd give to us, because that wasn't a serious\ncontract. It wasn't true. He hadn't bought it. But the furniture and everything was gone\nnaturally. And, uh, we were living underground from October 1942 til August 1944 in\ndifferent homes because people got very scared very often. Sometimes wanted us to leave\nthe same day. Some places we were two or three months until they got so scared. The place\nwhere we were last [Haarlem] we were eleven months and we thought for sure this will bring\nus to the end because by that time the uh Allies already had invaded in France and things\nlooked very good. Thinking in two, three weeks they must be in Holland and then in\nAugust...on August 26, 1944, the day that Paris was liberated by the Allies, that was the day\nwe were arrested.",
        "Q: What happened after your arrest, Helen?",
        "A: The uh the people in whose house we lived...she was uh a woman with three teenage\ndaughters. Her husband, as she said, had left...left her when the youngest one was born. She\ndid not have much money, and, uh, the girls were very nice. She was okay. She...she\nprepared our dinner and...cause this is something very important...how one lives. Two people\nalone in a room for such a long time. She prepared our dinner, and we had the, uh, coupons\nthat she could buy food because without the coupons you couldn't live. Our friends from this\nchurch came every second Saturday and brought us coupons. The coupons were stolen every\nmonth in the distribution centers by another person. All around Holland for the 20,000\npeople in Holland who were hiding. When the war was over, it was only 10,000. The others\nwere found. And uh they brought us everything we wanted. Any book and we just had to\nwrite it down and they tried to get us the books and they brought it. And they told us also\nwhat, how the war was going because we were cut off from the world because they were\nlistening to the BBC. If you are caught to listen to the BBC in London, you were executed.\n\u00b0 Ab Reusink.\n\"Two years and several months later, when a special department of the occupational forces arrived,\nAb Reusink protested that Helen and Seigfried's furniture were his belongings. Reusink produced\nthe three-year-old contract that he had drawn up originally. Thus, the Germans paid Reusink the\namount of the contract, which he then turned over to Helen and Seigfried.\nThey did it, and they told us what was going to happen. What was going on and how well we\nwere doing, we heard it from them. They also told us in July of 1944, that there were six\nextermination camps only in Poland. Only. And there was one...it was the largest one. It was\nAuschwitz. And by that time two million Jews already had been gassed. They were telling\nthat and, uh, it was very upsetting naturally. And everybody was hopeful, very, very hopeful\nthat the end was coming. So on this day when we were arrested, we were brought to the\nGestapo. Oh, I have to say when those men came- there were four men- two Germans and\ntwo Dutch, and two of them were downstairs at the front and back door, and two of them\ncame up to our room. They knocked on the door, they were very well mannered, and they\nsaid that we were arrested. They looked at the little belongings we had. They saw a picture of\nour daughter on the wall, because our friends brought us always picture to show what she\nwas looking because she had gone to...going to school and then she was very happy where\nshe was. And she looked happy. Uh, the one man said, \"If this 1s your child, and if you have\nmore children in hiding, we recommend that you take them with you because you are going\ninto a family camp.\" Here it comes back, the same what the Jewish Council had said. And\nyou will be...they will be taken care of while you are working. And my husband and I, we\ndidn't even have to look at each other, we didn't answer that. Then, they announ...the other\nman said, \"Why don't you take some warm clothes with you. Where you are going it is very\ncold.\" That was true. But we decided that we would take nothing. We went completely\nwithout luggage, knowing that we probably would come to Auschwitz because this was in\nsome way called a punishment that we did not follow the first time...that we had to be\npunished for that, so it could only have been Auschwitz. And, uh, the, uh, the, uh...one, one\nand half day interrogation by the Gestapo was mostly about giving the names of the people\nwho brought us those cards, because they had no idea who was breaking in and getting those\ntickets, and it must have been a very large circle.",
        "Q: We have to stop for one minute.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: We are having some difficulties.",
        "A: How do you know?\n[some technical conversation |",
        "Q: ...because they did not come through...",
        "A: I know. I know. A lot of things didn't come through . . .",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I wish [ had. . .",
        "Q: Helen, I would like to go back. We're back on camera. You are at the point of being arrested,\nbut as you are standing there, I find that there are a lot of questions. Uh, one of which is\nabout your daughter. You're at the point of being sent away, .. .\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: Okay. We are on camera. You're at the point of being arrested and there must have been a lot\nof things going through your mind, one of which was perhaps most important, your\ndaughter. Tell me what you knew about her at this point and where she was?",
        "A: What I knew about my daughter was this friend, Jo Vis, who was the original helper and he\ndidn't live too far from there. He was very often there to look himself at children. But, uh,\nin..at that time before...oh, maybe a year before we were arrested, Jo Vis had in his house\nalways people until he found for them another place. So one day there was a man staying\nwith them who had been on the black list because he was in the war in Spain. And uh he was\non the black list and he was hiding there waiting for a better place, and they were all arrested.\nHe and his wife and there were two friends of ours who came through us to him were there.\nThey all got arrested. His wife was pregnant at the time. They let her go home to three\nchildren. Uh. .. Everybody else was, uh, sent out. He went to Dachau. He went...he lived\nthrough the war. He happened to become a cook and he came home very well looking.\n(laugh) So, uh...but the two women were deported to Bergen-Belsen. And this was the next\nman in line, his name was Rinus,\u00b0 a wonderful man. Um, he was a gardener of the town, but\nhe was very, very well-informed about everything. He was self taught man. And he brought\nall the books my husband wrote down he wanted, because my husband was writing how the\nworld should be after the war. And in every way, in financial, in religious, 1n ethical, in any\nkind of way how the world should be. So he got the books he wanted every time when Rinus\ncame. And, uh, he also visited where my daughter was, because this is the district where all\nthe people who helped us were living, and he told us how happy she was, how wonderful she\nwas doing in school. She was well. There was really no reason to worry about her. The...the\nwoman...her foster mother, or whatever you would call it, was sick...I think for three weeks\nin the hospital. Another couple took over and took her in. They told us that afterwards. But\nshe was in the best of hands. And though I didn't worry about her. Since we did not see her.\nWe didn't...we didn't know ourselves where she was. It would have been very easy to get to\nher through all the others, but we never said, we never gave a name about the people who\nwere visiting us. We just didn't answer.",
        "Q: So when they came to take you, this was running through your mind. You knew your\ndaughter was safe. Um, what what, uh...where did you go at that point? They took you and\nwhere did they take you?",
        "A: To the..head.. headquarters of the Gestapo in Amsterdam. We were in Haarlem. And\n* Rinus Hille, a man who had been very active in efforts to save the Jews.\neverybody said, \"such a beautiful city.\" And I said, \"I've never seen it.\" They took us to..to\nAmsterdam, to the headquarters, and, uh, questioned separate, always. Questioned and\nquestioned and questioned. Sometimes they got very impatient. They did not hit us. They did\nnot touch us. They were very angry. It's very difficult to fight against somebody who doesn't\nreact. It's very difficult, and, uh...1n some way, we had uh given up that... that we would ever\nbe living. In some way, we were already on the way to die. And we accepted that this is it.\nThere was nothing you can do, and we didn't want to get anybody else in. We had no\ninterest.",
        "Q: Did they ask you about connections to the underground?",
        "A: Yes, that's that's what they wanted. That's the people who brought there, the people who\nvisited, maybe... We didn't even answer. There was nothing there which would have shown\nthat we were in any contact, but on the wall there was a map of Europe and what we heard\nfrom them where the uh Allies were, we put pins. That was there. But I think those guys\nwere so ignorant that we didn't even see that. We were never asked, \"How do you know?\"\nBecause it was not in the paper, but you got it from, from London. Never asked. Uh, uh.\nComing...ja...in this house was also a lady living...a seamstress\u2019 with her mother, older\nmother, and this was a spinster who was making dresses. And I got very close to her. She\nlived, she and her mother lived on the second floor and I sat down very often- we talked. She\nwas about my age and I still correspond with her. So when we left going down the steps, she\nwas at the steps and I had in my hand a coral pin I had gotten from my mother-in-law. I had\na very wonderful relationship to my mother-in-law...very. And, uh, I put it in her hands when\nI said goodbye, and, uh, that was that. We never saw the woman, her so called hostess or her\nthree daughters. Nobody was there. And, uh, they brought us . . .after this time at the\nheadquarters, they brought us for two days to the Amsterdam Jail which was very nice. I\nwould have always liked to (laugh) stay there and wait for the end of the war. It was clean\nand, uh, it was very nice. But there were only two days and then they brought us, always in\nthe night, in street cars to the station and we were brought to Westerbork which was the\ntransit camp in Holland.",
        "Q: Ya. Hold it a minute. What I'd like you to do...Can you describe the trip to Westerbork for\nme please? How did they take you and who went with you?",
        "A: I've never thought about that any more. I've never thought..that . .they were German soldiers.\nIt was a regular train. It was a regular train and German soldiers. We had no luggage. There\nwas no problem with us. We didn't talk. That's all. It's very...uh. . There was a big surprise to\nme when we came to Westerbork, about seeing all those people...so many friends we hadn't\nseen in years. They were there. And the green uniforms. Especially some women in those\nuniform. They looked chic, sexy. I...I didn't know...I said, \"Who 1s that?\" (laughs) They were\nall prisoners and they had some kind of work to do. I don't know...I was not long enough in\n\u201d Gre Orlessen.\nWesterbork to find out how really those relations were. I have read some books afterwards\nabout Westerbork, and, uh..",
        "Q: But for you? What was Westerbork like for you?",
        "A: It was a foreign world. Completely! The people who had been there for years, they took for\ngranted that this was the right thing, where they would be. And as I said, we met good\nfriends. We met a man there who lived...who had rented a room at the Frank's house, at their\napartment, and we knew him very well because we introduced him to the one daughter of\nfriends of ours and they got married. Now his wife was at that time when Jo Vis was\narrested...was there. They had no place for her, and so she came to Bergen-Belsen. Where he\nwent, I don't know, because the train where we...were leaving was about two days later and\nwas the last train to Auschwitz because then the strike came in Holland. The announcement\nthat the uh Allies would come to Holland, and the Germans knew that too, and they emptied\nWesterbork. There were only 300 people left . . .I didn't want- wish to be there to fight out\nwho would be the 300. And, uh, our. . .our train...our cattle train went to Auschwitz. We\nwere sure...we didn't know when we were came there that it was Auschwitz but in our mind\nsince we had heard that this camp existed, that we were punished...punished for our hiding\nand whatever, that that was the place where we were going.",
        "Q: What was the transport like? What was the trip like to Auschwitz?",
        "A: A nightmare. A real nightmare. Um, the train was overloaded with people, and, uh, we were,\nI would judge maybe a hundred and fifty people. There was no room to sit. We had to stand.\nI don't know how it was in others because I..I always didn't want to talk to people and ask in\ncamp how was it. We...uh...we were standing and, uh, a lot of people died...old\npeople...babies. No water. No food. No light. No air. And no toilet facilities. And next to me\nwas a woman who had a little child with her, a little girl, and she uh told me that the people\nwho came to arrest them from in the hiding places said the same thing with the same words\nas the Jewish Council said...as those guys said who arrested us, \"Take your children with\nyou.\" And she did. So I thought maybe I did something wrong. Maybe I did not really\nbelieve that there maybe would be a chance to have the child with you. So they took us...was\na three and a half day trip, and, uh, (long pause) twice the car stopped and the soldiers came\nin and they took our watches one time, and then they wanted our money telling us that the\nmoney wasn't worth anything. Where we were going we should give our money, and my\nhusband decided...we had our money in belt, money belt. We had that on, it on all those\nyears. And he didn't give anything. So when they closed again, we started to rip up this\nmoney...thousands of guilders. Wasn't easy to do. It's a physical step, also to rip it in little\npieces. But we did. I don't know- it was stupid probably, but we did it. And, uh, we arrived in\nthe middle of the night, the fourth night and was...you know, bright lights, and the doors\nopened, and the blue and white striped prisoners which were the prisoners from Kanada\nwhich we did not know Kanada existed. They looked very clean, starched uniforms. They'd\nnever answer any questions. We said, \"Where are we?\" No questions. Just getting the\nluggage out. And all the people had brought with them, half households. It was all gone and\npeople, I'm sure it was at every train the same were very upset, and they always got\npromised, \"We bring it to you where you are. We know where you will be.\" And, uh, at least\nwe didn't have to go through that. The woman and the child and I were together when we\nstarted to move in rows after we were separated from the men. And we walked...the ramp\nwas endless. I don't know how long, how many cars there were, but it seemed endless and\nthere was the man standing who made the decision who shall live or who shall die, but we\ndid not know that. He looked at the three of us and he asked me if that was my child, and I\nsaid no, and he made the movement with the thumb for one side to go for me and to the other\nside for this woman and her child, and I assumed that she had that privilege because they\nwere taking care of the children. And, uh, this man was very good looking. I have never\nforgotten the look of Dr. Mengele because I found out the next day it was Mengele. There\nwere more doctors than Mengele to do that since it was 24 hours going, train after train. But\nthis was Mengele, and, uh, he was very good looking, and, uh, his uniform and his boots. He\nwas just a perfect specimen of a man. And, uh, somebody had said, you know, when...a few\nmonths..few years ago when there was so much about Mengele, \"Would you recognize\nhim?\" I said, \"No, I'm sure not.\" The way he looked then at his height and, how can you? So\nhe to the aside, he sent me, it was the side of life, and the other was the side of death, as I\nheard the next day also. And, uh, there were no Jewish children in Auschwitz, just a few Dr.\nMengele wanted. Otherwise, there were no Jewish children. And the mothers were killed\nwith them when they had the mother. Uh, I have met...before I forget that and I come to it, I\nmet a woman who was with us in the barrack. A young woman. A very beautiful looking\nwoman. She was very depressed. And after..I had very . .[ had hardly any contact with her.\nAll of a sudden she said to me, \"You know what I did? I knew they would kill the children,\nand I let my children go,\" and uh she said, \"I couldn't help him them because I would be\nkilled too.\" She knew all that. She said, \"I heard it maybe two days before I was on the train\nand I let my children go.\" I don't know what happened to her. I don't know how she lived\nthrough it. I wish she would be living and that she could have children again. I don't know.\nBut that...went with me for many, many years. How do you live with that? The, uh, the side\nwhere we were, we were told to wait, and then came my husband who was also sent to this\ngood side, and we talked for a long time until the women were called into a large, a very\nlarge room. And I must say when we were walking to this place in the woods I heard voices.\nI heard women speak. I heard dogs and I heard music. And I said to the other women I said,\n\"I thought we would come to Auschwitz where they kill everybody. This is life. We are\ncoming into life. You hear the noises? You don't have to worry.\" So, uh, we were called into\nthat room and we got first our tatoo, and the girls who gave that were sitting at a long table\non a wall and they all were wearing black satin dresses. Not the same dress, but the same\nmaterial, and their hair was beautiful, long. Young women, very, very attractive women.\nAnd they had a book, and they put our name in and then they gave our tatoo and then we\nwere with them going into a circle of soldiers with big dogs and then we had to take off our\nclothes, strip. The one who stripped me, helped me stripping, took at the same time my\nwedding band off my finger. I had forgotten I had it. Maybe I would have tried to put it in\nmy mouth or whatever. I didn't know. So she took it and, uh, I still thought they were\nGermans. I did not understand that they were Jewish prisoners. So they helped us and they\nfound out...tried to find if we had jewelry hidden some other places and, uh, they shaved us,\nour head hair and our body hair. They left our shoes because that day no wooden shoes had\ncome. I heard, um, Anne Frank's mother who was with us. And I knew the Franks. And I did\nnot know that they had been arrested shortly before us, so I didn't know that. So I heard her\ndiscussing with one of those women...the woman..and she was with one daughter...no...she\nwas with two daughters. There she was with two daughters... And ,uh, the woman said she\nshould give her her shoes, and...and Mrs. Frank hesitated, and the girl said, \"I bring you\nevery day soup for your two daughters if you give me your shoes and I give you mine.\" And\nshe was very naive and she did this. She never got a drop of soup. The woman who was\nhandling me also said that...that must have been before or the same time...I don't know\nanymore. She said, \"You have good shoes on.\" I said, \"Yes, I am very glad I have good\nshoes on.\" She said, \"Would you like to change with me?\" I said, \"No.\" That's it. And then\nwe came under the cold shower and then we were outside the house and we got a dress, uh a\n. .dress. It could have been chiffon or it could have been wool. It could have been a size 10 or\nit could have been a size 25. It made no difference. I got a dress and we went to the barrack\nfor the night. That was all happening in the morning when we arrived during the night..all\nthat took the to the other night. We still didn't get to eat. We still couldn't go to the latrine. In\nthe meantime it was a latrine. And we were, uh brought to the barrack and we were\nexhausted. Absolutely exhausted. And I had a dream which was with me for many years and,\nuh, I dreamt that I was coming home and I was telling my family and my friends the strange\nthings that had happened to me this day, this weeks, I don't know anymore. Probably the\nmost upsetting was this being changed into a different person with losing your hair, losing\neverything you had, just as you are born. I think that was the greatest shock. You couldn't see\nyourself, but you saw the others, so you knew what you were looking like. I think it was the\ngreatest shock for all of us, because nobody menstruated anymore. That was over. And our\nyoung girls, we had a lot of young girls, we had the whole uh orphanage of Jewish girls from\nParis, girls of 15 years old, and they came from Morocco, and they were brought to Paris,\nand they were all taken, and we had them all. Beautiful girls. Fifteen years old. All they\ncould speak was their own language. They had nothing else. They couldn't talk to anybody\nelse. They were very upset when they were not menstruating. Everybody very young was uh\nconcerned, but then it was a blessing. What would we have done? We had nothing. We had\nno underwear. We had nothing.",
        "Q: Can we ..we need to hold it for a minute.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: We need to change tapes. Bonnie, let's break here.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Okay. We're back. We're back at the camp...",
        "A: Ja.",
        "Q: And you're describing just the loss of menstruation . . .",
        "A: Ja, and the dream. The dream that I came home and are telling my experiences- with the\ntatoo, and with the losing the hair, and uh losing everything we had and everybody said,\n\"This is impossible. You are dreaming, just a heavy dream-- that cannot happen to anybody.\"\nThe strange thing is, I read many years later the book Night and he talks about people who\ncame back and the people said he must have lost his mind. That was years later and so I'm\nnot the only one who had such dreams. I think there are more people who have dreams on\nthis kind, but I didn't have a...for a certain time and then it was over, that dream. Um...",
        "Q: You're in the barrack...",
        "A: Yes, I am in the barrack. We had 10 or 12 people in a bunk, and it was in the middle of the\nnight when we came, so it was very short time that we could sleep. When the morning came\nand the first day in Auschwitz started, was a roll call. Roll call in Auschwitz I'm sure that\neverybody had about the same experience...that's uh the barrack elder was counting\neverybody, we were standing with five in...and I always, always...I don't know why... tried to\nstand exactly in the middle. Not in front, not in the back, and not on the side. I wanted to be\nlittle and short and not being seen. I don't know why. Later on, I found that the women who\nwere tall were always picked to special things. They were not always good. So I didn't want\nto be picked for anything. I didn't want to be there. So, uh, we were counted but every roll\ncall, every roll call was wrong. It never came out that we were as many people as they had\nhad on their books. And the women got very...those women, those barrack elder, were very\nupset about it. They were also very beautiful dressed, with black dresses. Uh, I still didn't\nknow that they were prison, Jewish prisoners. It didn't dawn on me that they would be\nprisoners. Look at us and look at them. And, uh, then came the SS men to check it, and that\ndidn't work out. So he was very angry, and they were worried and they looked through the\nbarrack and they found people who were hiding under the mattresses and they were found\npeople who had died, and though they put them all there on the floor and counted them, and I\nthink then maybe they were then, uh, accepting the numbers. I don't know. Even they mostly\nspoke German and I tried always to understand what they were saying, it was difficult. When\nthis roll call was over, then volunteers had to go to the kitchen to get the coffee. And it was\nin big barrels and you had to carry them with uh sticks, and uh I felt so strong and so healthy,\nI always volunteered. I don't know why. I guess I was curious to see what the kitchen looked\nlike. I think that was it. You didn't see much because you never had...got into the kitchen and\nmost of the people who worked tn the kitchen were born in Poland and spoke Polish and, uh,\nfor long times before all that happened, there was always uh, uh, another world in between\nthe Germans and the Eastern Jews and that was in Auschwitz also. Maybe even stronger, that\ndidn't dawn on me first either. Eh... Maybe stronger because there were so many Polish\nwomen who had been there or some other camp and ghettos for a long time already. This\nwas '44. They started in 39. So, uh, they had so called jobs, and when somebody came, new\nin, who had been hiding or so, they always had a job for them. Always. They got...we never\nsaw them again. They got help. We didn't...I didn't...I didn't know anybody. I came with a\nDutch group, and I was considered to be Dutch because I spoke Dutch with them. The Dutch\nwomen were uh very unfortunate because they could never adjust, practically. They, uh, died\nlike the flies, especially in Auschwitz. And, uh, I didn't understand that. I met the Hungarian\nwomen who had come a few months before us. Very intelligent, very...also attractive\nwomen. They were at that...1n this camp I was...it was uh, Birkenau B-2, uh, they were the\nkeepers of the latrines, and the washrooms, and I uh washing...I don't know for some reason I\nthought I just have to wash every day and they were not always open, but I got friendly with\nthem and I could come in. Now washing 1s a big work because we had high, uh, uh, wash\nstands on high heels and you had to climb in there and then there was come cold water. That\nwas all. And then you put your dress on again. But it gave me a very good feeling that I had\ndone that. I felt...I felt I needed that. And, uh, the Dutch women said to me, \"You are crazy.\nThe next thing is you get pneumonia. How can you go under that cold water? You get\npneumonia.\" I said, \"Maybe there is some loose dirt because it's already you know some...a\nwhole day, but whatever there is, I feel good.\" They didn't go. It was not very comfortable\nclimbing, but also the friendship I had with the...with the women from Hungary helped me to\nget in and have some time to talk to them. The same with uh the latrine was closed at many\nhours. I could always get in. And, uh, we...we became good friends. They were much\nyounger than I was.",
        "Q: What did you do on a day to day basis?",
        "A: In. . .in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: Nothing regular. Nothing regular. We were going sometimes with carts, with two wheel\ncarts to . . into the woods and cut out some grass, squares, and brought them to a place where\nthe soldiers were living and then they put that cut grass. We, uh, moved sometimes bricks on\nthose things back and forth from one corner to the other- the it was not regular, and, uh, I do\nremember that we...when we were carrying those bricks back and forth... Oh no, that was...\nthat was later. That was not in Auschwitz. That was in the camp I was.",
        "Q: Stay with Auschwitz for a minute.",
        "A: Ja. You know it came to me that we had those carts there too. That's how it brought it\ntogether. No, we didn't, uh, we didn't have regular things to do. We went to the station\nsometimes and moved stones. Nothing special. We had two more selections with Dr.\nMengele, only that was in the barrack. Many times during the day, there was all of a sudden\na signal that everybody had to go back to the barrack, close the door, couldn't be out. So we\nfound out that this was the day when one of the doctors came because one day we had it. We\nwere going out, but with us it, it was Mengele again and we took off our dress and in the\nnude we marched in front of him and he makes the same signs, to the right or to the left. In\nthat case there was in the uh barrack a small room where the ones who were to be killed\nwere settled and we could go. But by that time we knew what it meant because I had met a\nman walking through the camp. I walked around a lot to look. I was always a curious person.\nI wanted to see what's going on here. And I saw a man, the only man I saw in the camp, and\nhe was Polish also. He had a triangle. And he was a criminal as I found out later, a black\ntriangle, and, uh, I asked him. I spoke German, I tried Dutch. He spoke Polish. We talked\ntogether. And, uh, I asked him where we were. And he said, \"You are not in Auschwitz.\nYou're in Birkenau.\" And Birkenau, he said, \"You see that chimney there, its smoking. Don't\never think that you come out alive here. This is the way we are going to heaven, through the\nchimney. And that little house next to it is where the gas is.\" It was a few days there-- very\nshort time. And, uh, I was always wondering what is this man walk around in this camp? The\nbooks I have read, the many, many books of people who had been in Auschwitz...I assume\nnow that this man was looking for a woman...because we had women who uh had some boy-\nfriends coming into and bring...bringing them gifts, food, clothes. I don't know what. But I\ndo remember that very much.",
        "Q: Who could they have boy friends? Where did the boy friends come from?",
        "A: From the other camp. From a work camp. Those were people who were already in camp for\nyears. They were maybe kapos. I don't know. They could go. Whatever they were. They\nwere not Jewish, but uh they looked for, you know, for the . . .the new women because they\nwere still nice and, uh, we had one woman from, who was from Berlin. She was a prostitute.\nShe had told me when we were 1n jail. She had told me that she was a prostitute. And that\nshe's Jewish, and, uh, I never saw her there anyway. But there were women who were ready\nfor whatever they could get to be with men where and how I don't know. But this came...not\nat that moment...I was thinking of that, of that guy who was there. He was clean dressed,\nwell-dressed, and good boots which was the most important thing.",
        "Q: Can you take it...I'd like to go back to a minute to the Mengele selection in the barrack.",
        "A: Ja. Outside.",
        "Q: Uh, he...was this outside or inside?",
        "A: No. Outside.",
        "Q: Outside? He took all of you outside?",
        "A: We were all outside. Yes. And we walked by.",
        "Q: Uh, did you see what happened to the women he chose?",
        "A: No. I only know that they had to go into the barrack to the a little side room. Maybe it was a\nroom where the elder was sleeping. You know she had a separate room. It could be. I don't\nknow. What..ja, that was the second time. There were a mother and a daughter with us. The\ndaughter was 15. You know, you...when you are under 16, you should have gone to the other\nside...so she was 15, and the mother was taken. So this girl was with us to the end. And\neverybody was trying to replace the mother. It was a Dutch girl, but I don't know what\nhappened to her.",
        "Q: There was, you said, a third selection.",
        "A: A third selection started in the same way, with Mengele also. And then..there he...they\ncounted 300 women. And to me it was clear that this would go to work.",
        "Q: This was to where?",
        "A: To work. That meant...and because we had no other job. It was already two months that we\nhad no..nothing to do, just wait from one meal to another. And it wasn't bad, the food there in\nAuschwitz. It wasn't enough, but it was not bad. Ja. The bread was excellent. They baked\nvery good bread, and, uh, ja...the . . the bread soldiers get. Brown, blackish bread. Very\ngood. It was never enough, naturally. And there was always something under that big piece\nof bread. It, uh, was a wedge. And there was uh on there uh sometimes cottage cheese,\nsometimes uh some uh jelly, marmalade, a piece of sausage. Not all together. That was one\nmeal, and uh we got that so-called coffee which only looked like a black mess, and, uh, then\nthe second meal we go, probably ja, mostly soup. But we had nothing to eat with so we had\nto share a bowl of soup with, with four people. And, uh,",
        "Q: The third selection then . .",
        "A: Ja. We were counted 300 people, and as I said, I assumed we're going to work. Mrs. Frank\nwas in those 300 with Anna, but her daughter...was other daughter\u2019\u201d was not there. She was\nin quarantine. She had some skin eruptions. Germans were very much afraid of skin get\ncontagious or so. So she was in quarantine and Mrs. Frank said, \"I'm not going with you\nwherever you're going if you're going uh because I wait until Margot comes back.\" That's\nwhat she did. She disappeared during the night...went into another barrack and, uh, came to\nBergen-Bel. She didn't come...she died before she came to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Can you tell me? This seems as good a time as any to tell us a little about Mrs. Frank and\nAnna. What were they like as people?",
        "A: Now uh, I knew them before and, uh, uh, Mr. Frank was a typical German officer in his\n'\u00ae Margot Frank.\nstand. A very correct, very bright man. Had an excellent relationship with Anna. She had a\nmuch better relationship with him than with her mother. And, uh, Anna was a very quiet\ngirl...liked to write as everybody knows and, uh, Mrs. Frank was, as she did the dealing with\nher shoes, which is, you know, a small thing, when we came that she...that she changed the\nshoes. It showed in some way that it was very difficult for her to see the real place where we\nwere. The reality, what, what could happen, what, what is happening. And, uh, Margaret was\na very attractive girl. More attractive than Anne. But Anne was a lovely girl but she never\ntalked much. They were...he was a very successful businessman, and everybody liked him. I\ndon't know why he took all those people into that house, which was really too much. Made it\nvery difficult, because to be even with two in one room hiding 1s a great stress. To be with\nthe same person with your husband or with your wife for two years in one room is great\nstress and many marriages broke up afterwards. Uh, the 300 women were in another barrack\nand the next morning we were brought to the original Auschwitz camp which we hadn't\nseen, and we got some food for the day and we were in another cattle train. That was the\n28th of October. My daughter was 7 years old that day. It was a gorgeous day. The leaves\nthey were all changing. We were going west, what I thought was just the most wonderful\nthing. Could only be good, and, uh, the doors were kept open while we were going and we\ncame to Czechoslovakia. They didn't tell us 1t was Czechoslovakia. It was high up in\nmountains...was nice, and, uh, it was a good feeling to be away from those killing places and\nfrom the chimney. It felt good. The commandant of this camp...the place was Kratzau.\nKratzau was a factory...had a factory which originally came from Berlin. Hard, hard to find\nout those things because nobody told you really. A Berlin factory probably...was probably all\ndestroyed. They came and took over this factory, which was originally a linen or something.\nSo they made...they had all electric benches, and we got boxes of little cylinders, maybe\nthree or four inches long, and maybe an inch hollow, light material, and we had to put the\nknife of the machine inside the opening. That means we did not do it, but the foreman did it.\nThe foreman turned on the machine and we changed constantly when that shaved inside\nmade the opening a little bigger. That was a factory. She said we have a very good factory\nhere and she addressed us as girls, \"Hi, girls.\"",
        "Q: Who is she?",
        "A: The commandant.",
        "Q: The commandant.",
        "A: The commandant with a white sweater and a turtle neck. She looked cute. She was about 22\nyears old, and uh she called us girls and she said, \"You will have a good life here. You work\nhard, we treat you well.\" It's in the factory where you are living, not in the same factory, but\nabout 15 minutes to walk, and we clean it all up and we are 300 women in each room. So\n1200...we were the last 300....1200 women. Sounded very nice. And, uh, but we changed\ncommandant. It was always a change. Always another woman came. All women. Our\ncaretakers were four soldiers and four women, SS women, young, who were very unhappy\nthat they were in this kind of a village where there was nothing. There was absolutely\nnothing to do, and the winter was very harsh, very cold, lots of snow and ice, and uh the\nplaces where they were sleeping were very primitive. Not much more than we had. They had\nthe same bunks, and, uh, the same toilet. Uh, we were not allowed to use that toilet, but we\ndid anyway. Outside, between the stairs, like in old European places, there was a toilet in\nbetween the stairs, the in between the first and second floor in a corner. That was like that.\nThat was their toilet. I don't know if they had a bathroom. But they built a shower, a large\nshower when we came there. They started to build it. We were never allowed to use it.\nNever. And, uh, we had no water. We had uh a little sink in the hallway which dribbled. We\nhad no water. We could never wash ourselves, and after a very short time we were full of\nlice. Then they...they deloused us, which took a whole day to get deloused. They deloused us\nin Auschwitz already, and the lice came back after a few hours. And they had big drums\nwhere they put our clothes in and we got hot water to wash ourselves in Auschwitz. Didn't\nkill the uh (pause) didn't kill the...we, uh. ..the factory was working 12 hours from 6 to 6, and\nwe could choose, have a choice of day or night shift, and I selected night shift because they\nsaid we would get on Sunday an extra portion of food. That was very important. Food is still\nimportant to me. So it was very important to take the night shift. So the day shift went, and\nwhen the day shift came home, the other ones were already on their way there, but, um as I\nsaid, the winter was bad. We had no heat in our rooms. We lost all our blankets. A lot of\nwomen made underwear from the blankets which when we found that out, we were just\nbesides ourselves, because there were no blankets anymore. And, uh, the International Red\nCross came. A great surprise. Somebody...you know...there are a lot of rumors in those\nplaces. Somebody said they...a cattle car came with boxes in there, and came from\nSwitzerland and we thought that's ridiculous. But a few days later, we got each a handful of\nsugar. Since we had nothing where we could carry it in, everybody got a handful of sugar,\nand you had to lick it right away because there was no other way and our hands were so\nfilthy. We were smelling so much because a foreman in the factory didn't want to come close\nto us, we were smelling so badly, and they didn't want those lice. They can jump. (laugh)\nAnd, uh, we got there in the morning and we came home. We got bread. Sometimes with\nsomething on them. The portions got smaller, cause Germany didn't have much food\nthemselves. And, uh, in the evening we got the so-called dinner which was soup, mostly\nsoup where potatoes or rutabaga was cooked in, but the potatoes and the rutabaga were out,\nand that was all. Or, potatoes in the pan cooked we got sometime three or four potatoes as\ndinner. Christmas we had a very fancy dinner because they had slaughtered a horse and that\ntasted very good. And potatoes. Cooked. That was...but we were already on our way down\nphysically, but when the International Red Cross came actually into the camp...there were\nfour women coming in green uniforms, and we were standing in our five lines, and I heard\nthe commandant in German tell them, \"You just saw our beautiful shower installations. Look\nat those filthy Jews. They do not want to wash themselves. Those pigs.\" And, uh, none of\nthose women asked the question why we didn't want to wash. There was no...1f if they would\nhave washed...or asked, I would have said whatever would have happened. But it was not\npossible. They had brought also sardines, and we got two women one can of sardines. Most\nof us got sick- we didn't have any fat for so long. They must have maybe brought also more\npotatoes or something because...and, oh, ja, green peas...because we had that on Christmas.\nNo soap. (laughs) Nothing like it.",
        "Q: Was there anyplace at all where you were allowed to wash ever?",
        "A: No. In the factory, there was a toilet and they had a little sink this size and there was water.\nYou couldn't wash yourself. Maybe you could drink little bit, but the half hour in between\nthe...you know, to, uh, the hours, the twelve hours, was a half an hour time, but we had\nnothing to eat. We had eaten our bread. We had no pockets to put it in. So, uh, you\ncouldn't...you couldn't leave it on your bed or so, because it would be stolen in one minute.\nSo we ate it.",
        "Q: What happened after the Red Cross came?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: How much longer were you in this condition before things changed?",
        "A: Things never changed. Things got just bad uh when the war got bad. You see, I was always,\nwhen we marched to the factory, always 1n the last row because there were two soldiers with\nus and they spoke German. I could hear what they were saying to each other. And it was just\nuh music in my ears, because they said they were terribly upset. They hadn't heard for weeks\nfrom their families, and they said that Germany is bombed and then all of a sudden I heard\nthat the Allies are in Nuremberg. And I thought, \"In Nuremberg...in the middle of the\ncountry.\" And I told my friends and I said, \"Oh, that cannot take long at all anymore. That\nmust be over soon. They are already in Nurenberg.\" But we were the ones who really\nsuffered so much because it was so cold and we had so little strength left. We buried our\nwomen that died. We didn't know the names. We maybe knew sometimes of their first name.\nWe got very much in going into shells. We...we had no strength anymore to discuss, to talk,\nwhich we did in the beginning. We were playing word games, the ones who knew some and\ncould do it, but that was over. You, you couldn't do that anymore. And, uh, then there must\nhave gotten notice that if..1f. . . the Russians would be coming to us, if they come, then would\nshould be physically in the most perfect condition so they took us on a train to the next town\nwhere there was a prisoner camp- prisoner of war camp. We didn't know. They were French\nsoldiers, and they were so upset when they saw us the way we looked, and they went with us\ninto the uh sauna and they brought the hot water to us and they helped us. But that's all they-\nthey could do. They wished they would have food, because we...we were full of edemas and\nwe were in bad shape, and that took two days, this transport...all those people to that town,\ninto, into this camp and getting home again. And, uh, I was sick. I was sick before that. I got,\nuh, you know...with the...where you get eye- the eye white..get the white of the eye get\nyellow...",
        "Q: Jaundice?",
        "A: Uh, Ja, it's not jaundice, it was....",
        "Q: Hepatitis?",
        "A: Yes, ja, I got contagious hepatitis. I was terribly sick, and so that week because I couldn't eat.\nI couldn't eat, I only wanted to drink. And we had a so-called hospital in there and uh there\nwas one Polish doctor. She was...she was Jewish. Uh, she was a lung specialist. And she had\nnothing to work with. Absolutely nothing. The only thing she had was hot water, and maybe\nsome pain killer. I had no pain. I was just very, very weak. And uh, I guess she said I had\nmore temperature than I really had. Otherwise, I would have to be out. I'm sure because I\ncould hardly walk. I uh, also had an inflamed thumb. And that was throbbing and that\nwas...got red up here and I had no water. I had nothing to...but in the factory where I was\nworking on that machine, there was a file with a point and with that file I opened...filth. I\nopened it. The pus came out. Nothing happened. (laughs) Nothing happened. I had scarlet\nfever and nothing happened. I... That scarlet fever was still in Auschwitz because I brought it\nwith me from the camp in uh Holland. There was an epidemic of scarlet fever. But uh I lived\nthrough all that and, uh, after we were cleaned. After we so-called cleaned, uh the rooms\nwere very cold because they opened them. I don't know where they had the idea when the\nopened the window everything is clean you know. We had no mattresses anymore, we had\njust the plain wood. We did have some...the blankets were gone. The mattresses disappeared,\nand, uh, I have one uh experience which upset me afterwards very much. What I did. One\ntime I...when we came...when I came home from work, I found a mattress in a bed nobody\nwas in and took the mattress and covered myself and then when the others came, somebody\nwas pulling on the mattress...wanted this mattress. So we were sleeping on, on loose boards,\nyou know the...and I took one of...I got. . .[ jumped out of bed. I took the board and lifting it\nup over her head, I thought I wanted to kill her. Taking my mattress. I mean that was just the\nmost important thing. This protected me from this horrible cold. And that I really wanted to\nkill somebody. She dropped the mattress. She got (laugh) got scared. And I really probably\nwould have. I don't know. Uh, in...also, there's another experience in this...1n uh Kratzau.\nThat's what I had started, and I thought it was in Auschwitz uh the factory had no material\nanymore, but the...those women from the SS had to do something, so they made us bringing\ncoal from one corner to the other in the court, in those...you call those things with two\nwheels.",
        "Q: The carts or the...",
        "A: The cart, ja. So we always marched by...with a full one and there with an empty one. One\ntime I when I came by I thought, \"She's a nice looking young woman.\" She speaks German. I\nsaid uh, \"I'm glad that I learn a job for after the war.\" So she looked at me and she stopped\nand I stopped. She said, \"What do you mean.\" I said, \"I can always go as a mover.\" She said,\n\"That's a wonderful idea.\" So then I went on and I came back. She was surprised that I spoke\nfluently German. She said uh, \"You come from Germany?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" She said uh,\n\"Why are you here?\" I said, \"What a question.\" \"What did you do that you are here?\" I said,\n\"I didn't do anything. I'm Jewish.\" \"No,\" she said, \"You are all criminals. You all have done\nsomething. Look what you look like. The kind of clothes you are wearing.\" I said, \"You\nreally think those are our clothes?\" She got, uh, a little...she said was a little funny because I\nspoke very good German, not like one who maybe was a criminal in any shape or form.\nThere was another woman going by. I said, \"Look at that woman with her cart. She has a\nPh.D. Her father had one of the largest wine cellars in Amsterdam.\" She said, \"You are,\nyou're out of your mind.\" So I went on. When I came back, then she looked me over again,\nshe didn't talk to me anymore. I asked her what she was doing. I know. I said, \"What are you\ndoing or what did you do?\" She said, \"I was a teacher in Hamburg.\" She...they were told that\nwe were criminals. I said, \"Our clothes were all taken from us. Those are clothes from other\npeople, what you see, and they were never washed.\" Yet was a very interesting (laugh)\nconversation. I hope that it sticks in her mind. (laugh) That's all I can say to that. When we\ncame closer to the end of the war, I think that's what you want to know. The, uh, ...and we\nwere so-called clean, ready for the Russians...we were all very sick...because of the food and\nof diarrhea and the whole place was messy...24 hours. And, uh, we were one time again\ntaken to another place where we were examined by a group of doctors and, uh, the German\ndoctors, they talked German to each other. And so, they uh...when they saw...when I was...it\nwas my turn, so they, uh, tried the nipple . . .to press my nipple and I pushed back and so one\nsaid to the other I had such an edema- my stomach was so swollen. He said I could have bet\nthat she's pregnant. And, uh, I I said, \"That would be a medical miracle.\" They pushed each\nother. They couldn't understand that somebody would say that at that...at that moment. But\nuh, that was about all they did. They saw the edemas. But, uh, we were walking still on our\nlegs. But then one morning when we came out into the cold, the Germans were gone. The\nwar was over. It was May 9th- that's very late. And, uh, the gates were open, and I marched\nout of the gate. I wanted to see it. I saw the lilies of the valley right in front, and I went into\ntown. The town we had walked through every day and I always admired the butcher shop\nbecause he had a lot of sausages hanging there. And, uh, one day there was as I saw on the\nstreet, a little dog, such a round dog, and I said to the girl, \"Wouldn't that be good roasted?\"\n(laugh) And later, many later years when I told that to my husband, he couldn't believe that,\nthat somebody would eat a roasted dog. I said, \"Sure, I would have eaten anything.\" He\ncould never understand that. So I saw the butcher shop when the war was over, and I went\nin. And I said if he would have some sausage for me. He said, \"No.\" And I walked the street,\nand there was a Russian standing there, a soldier. He had a piece of black bread 1n one hand\nand a chicken leg in the other, and I walked up to him and I don't know Russian. I pointed to\nmy stomach and to my mouth, and he give me both. Made me so sick. (laugh) It was much\ntoo rich. But that was the first day, and the third day I decided I was going home. I did not\nwant to wait for what the uh, the owner...not . . the man in charge of the factory, what he\nsaid to us, we should wait until the American or the International Red Cross would come and\npick us all up, bring us to the countries where we belonged. I didn't believe it. I wanted to go\nhome.",
        "Q: Tell me a moment about the owner of the factory.",
        "A: Was not owner. It was...must have been a, as I said before, a trustee.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The owner of the factory, I don't know. There were Germans who worked there, and they\nmust have left uh when the Russians came so close and came there. And, uh, the, uh, the\nRussians came on the second day with the soup kitchen. And it was filthy, and the place was\nnot clean because I left on the 12th and I didn't want to stay there and wait. I just had to go.\nDid not know where Kratzau was. I only know [ had to go west. That's all I knew. And a 16\nyear old girl who was with the group from Amsterdam, she wanted to come with me. And I\ndidn't want her. And I said it a few times. I said, \"I don't want to take the responsibility. I'm\ngoing to places where I don't know myself.\" And, uh, \"Oh,\" she said, \"I want to go home. I\nwant to find my mother. And you speak German. You can do it.\" So, she went with me, and\nuh come to the next station walking...train station, and there were not no trains anymore at\nall. So she said, \"What are we going to do now?\" And uh, I said, \"I really don't know what\nwe are going to do now. I suggest we go to the next town. Sit in the center of the town. They\nalways have something green there. And the way we look women will come. They are\ncurious. They will ask us who we are?\" So the women came! And they said, uh, they could\ndo something for us. They spoke German--in Sudaten. And uh, I said we would like to get\nhot water to wash ourselves. We would like to get a bed, and we also would like something\nto eat. She said you can have all that to eat. She said, \"A chicken died today.\" If you want\nme, I'll prepare it for you. I said, \"Why not? I have always have eaten dead chickens.\"\n(laughter) They were never alive. I was so happy with that chicken. She boiled it and it was\nvery good and we could clean ourselves. And uh, the next day we went on and found another\ntown where they told us that probably that day a train would come, probably. And a train did\ncome and we just went on. There was nobody to talk to and, uh, during the night the train\nstopped and the Russians came on to the train. They had flashlights and they looked...had the\nflashlights on us and then they touched our...touched us here [points to stomach] and then\nthey wanted to go and then I said again my stomach that we are hungry. So they gave us\nsardines. (laughs) Sardines. So II said, they would have to open it. We had nothing. And\nthey did. I found out not too much later that they were looking for Germans to take them\nback and then feeling here and the rest they felt we were women, because you, you know,\nthe way we looked and the hair and all that, they didn't know what it was. But, uh, that's how\nthey found out we were women and left us alone and gave us the sardines. So uh we took a\nlot of trains. We took one train that was...uh a train with all beds. German train with all beds,\nwhite, clean...was wonderful...just wonderful. There was no food there, but there was a good\nbed. And when the train stopped and we went into town, we begged. I begged for bread. I\nonly wanted bread. Because I was used to that bread takes away the hunger. Bread and water\nwas fine. In some place, they had nothing. They give us an umbrella. (laugh) That was\nthe...the, the . .. uh, the mayor's office we went in...we didn't know, and they gave us an\numbrella. And I said, \"Thank you.\" And they had no food. So I took the umbrella and I put it\nthrow away. Was dumb, probably I could have changed it for some bread. I don't know.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get to where you were going at this point?",
        "A: Home? Six and one half weeks. But, uh, we came to the first American DP camp built. It\nwas just finished in Plzen.",
        "Q: How long were you in Plzen?",
        "A: In Plzen, we were told that the DP camp was being built, that we should look for it. And we\nfound it. And there were about 400 people there already all lying in the big gymnasium,\nsomething like it, on the floor. Men and women who had been uh workers, who had been\npicked up in different countries, and everybody wanted to go a different place. They were\nthere and had blankets and we were all lying on the floor. There were no Jews. We were the\nonly Jews. And that was a strange thing. We couldn't...I couldn't understand that. So then we\nwere a little bit examined, and we became uh double rations and that started anti-Semitism 1n\nthose four or five hundred people. That the Jews here, look what they give those women.\nWas difficult, very difficult, until then the Americans had trucks, open trucks and brought us\nfarther west because that's where we wanted to go. Also, there was a lists going from this\nplace all over the world who was there surviving, and that came to Chicago and they found\nout to Chicago... sorry...to Amsterdam to find out that I was alive, but they didn't know\nwhere. They only knew the name was there. That was all those lists were...Chicago. (laughs)\nAnd, uh, we were in an open truck to Leipzig where there was a very large DP camp, about\n25,000, and there were maybe 25 Jews. That was all. Uh, there I went to...I asked I wanted to\ngo to a gynecologist. I wanted to find out if they would do something to me that I was\nnot...uh, had not, all that time, uh, no ...what's the word?",
        "Q: 'Cause you were not menstruating?",
        "A: That's right. Ja. So, uh, and this was a German gynecologist, and he looked at me and I\nlooked a little funny. By that time I was clean. By that time I had no lice anymore because\nthere was a medical tent in this camp and I walked in with my little friend and I said, \"Listen,\nwe have so much lice. Can you help us? The Germans have tried to delouse us so many\ntimes, they never could.\" \"That's nothing,\" they said. We wanted to take our dress off and\nthey said, \"Don't do that.\" They had a large spray machine which was used to discharge\nwhite powder under the arms and under the skirt, and two hours later all those lice were dead\nand I thought the Americans they really know it. They had DDT and they didn't know at that\ntime, they had killed more than lice. So I went to this doctor, because I was clean and he\nlooked at me and he looked at all the edemas, and he said uh, \"Where were you? Where do\nyou come from?\" I said, \"I was in uh extermination camp.\" He called his nurse in..and he\nsaid, \"Listen what that woman says. Look what she looks like. 70 pounds and swollen.\" He\nsaid, \"Tell me.\" So he and she, they listened. He did not know those details. He had no idea.\nHe surely knew that the Jews had been gone, but he did not know what they had done to\nthem. That was in the city of Leipzig.",
        "Q: We have relatively little time I would like to move us to what happened when you came\nback to Amsterdam.",
        "A: Ja. That is.. Ja. The, uh...when I came to the border. We came to the border with an\nAmerican train. Took six days because we had to built pontoon bridges. The American\nsoldiers did not give us anything to eat or to drink. They didn't understand what I meant\nwhen I said that we had nothing to eat. They didn't understand. Six days. We were very sick.\nWe came to the border. We had to walk over the border because the train only stopped there\nand we got into an office. We only could get on the train if you said you were uh, a Dutch\ncitizen, which I said and I was not, and uh, the bureaucracy came and I, as a good German,\nsaid right away, \"I am not a Dutch citizen. I am stateless.\" And the man had never heard\nwhat stateless 1s, but that young girl with me who was very happy to be home said, \"Be\ncareful with that woman. She is a German, and she is an enemy of our country.\" She\nconfused that man completely and he put me in jail. And, uh, I've never seen her again. I\ndidn't want to see her. She was in Holland. She was saved. We were together for six and a\nhalf weeks. I was a mother and she was a child, in a way. And that's what happened. Though\nuh, two days later the Rabbi of Eindoven that was the town where it happened, got me out of\njail. I don't know...I forgot his name, but he found out. I don't know how, and I got with\nanother lie and big screaming, uh,...permission to go to Amsterdam because there were no\ntrains...there was no...and I wanted to go to Amsterdam. So I came there, and I found the\npeople who had helped us and, uh, they told me that my daughter was fine, which was the\nmost important thing.",
        "Q: Describe two things please. The meeting with your daughter please, and then how you found\nyour husband.",
        "A: I didn't find my husband. He never came back.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me what happened to him.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: I'm sorry.",
        "A: Ja. I don't know what happened. I don't know. I saw him the last time before I was going in\nto this place where the women were in the black dresses. I never have seen him again and\nthere is no...there is no record for the dead. There's a record of the trains...the numbers of the\ntrains and how many people were in the trains, all the trains deporting the Jews, you know\nthat? So I have it. And, uh, all the trains I have been in are there, but they have no record of\nwho died. Uh, they told me that Doris was fine and the next day one of the friends had a jeep\nbecause there was nothing else and he brought me to that town where she was. They had told\nher already that I had been sick and that I was better and I would come, but nobody knew\nwhen. In that little village where she was, all the girls who had had relationships with\nGerman soldiers, when the war was over were brought into the center of the city and their\nheads were shaved. And she thought it was so funny. Kids, you know, you know, they didn't\nunderstand. And so here I was with a shaved head and she looked at me and she said, \"Are\nyou my mother?\" I said, \"Yes, I'm your mother.\" I didn't come close to her. I didn't touch her.\nAnd she was eating lunch because afternoon school starts she said, \"I would like to go to\nschool that...she said to our friend, Rinus, she said, \"Rinus, If you could bring me with your\njeep to the school, I would like the kids to see the jeep. So that's what they did. Not me. And,\nuh, I did something very wrong. I asked the lady where she was if I could take her with me\nthat day. Leave everything there. Anyway probably thinking I bring her back, but I didn't. I\ntook her with me. And we had nothing. We had no bed. Nothing. I uh, felt I needed her. I\nneeded her very much. We need our children more than they need us. That's something I\nhave learned. I needed her and I did it. So uh, some of the friends gave us a room with one\nbed and we slept there. We, uh...we made it. We got rooms and we could rent because there\nwas no place and, uh, since my husband didn't come back. A year and a half later we went to\nthe United States where my parents were. And she was very happy to have grandparents, to\nhave uh, cousins, uncles...we didn't have.",
        "Q: Did the two of you...Did she adjust to you?",
        "A: It must have taken her a long time. I don't think that I was aware of what I had done to take\nher out of this secure home in this life with a woman who wasn't completely normal. I'm\nconvinced. I was the only one who didn't know. But I'm convinced. And she, uh...I was only\nlooking for a place for us to live that we were just like a family and that she would...she\nwould be home and I'm the mother. But we never discussed it, practically all our lives. Uh, it\nwas sometimes when she was maybe...that time when I picked her up she was seven-and-a-\nhalf. Maybe when she was...when she was still in Amsterdam, one day she did something\nwhich I said she shouldn't. She said, \"I wish you wouldn't have come.\" And that was the only\ntime as a child.",
        "Q: Okay. I think we are about done, and I thank you.",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "Q: Very much. Thank . ..",
        "A: But my daughter had learned. Ja, and we never discussed it.",
        "Q: Did she know?",
        "A: We never discussed it. Uh, there is a book out about LNever Said Goodbye.",
        "Q: Ya.",
        "A: You know it?",
        "Q: Ya.",
        "A: And I...when it came out, there was a write up in the paper, and she happened to be visiting\nfrom Israel, and I said, \"That's a very interesting book. I would like to read it.\" And she\nlooked at it. I said, I'm only very much upset that all those people who say they were\nabandoned, say that still after they have children themselves. Don't they want to protect their\nchildren?\" \"No,\" she said, \"I can understand.\" I wasn't abandoned. It was the first time, and,\nuh, \"I said I will never learn that, never and never accept it.\" She uh, went to New York then,\nand then she found the book and she send it to me and she put in there, \"Thank you for\ngiving me life twice.\" It wasn't necessary to discuss it. Really. It would have made our\nrelationship painful if we would have discussed it. If I would have constantly heard that I see\nit from the wrong way then I never could. So that...um that she has understood after all those\nyears. We have a very good relationship now.",
        "Q: That is good. When did she first know...that, when did you first tell her that you had not just\nbeen sick? How old was she when you picked her up?",
        "A: When I picked her up she was seven-and-a-half. Oh, I talked about the camp to anybody.",
        "Q: Oh, you did? Okay. So she knew then?",
        "A: Ja, but it was . . .it didn't really sink in that . . .No, no really not at that time- much later. And\nwhen I started to study all the books, much later, when I started to speak, she, in some way I\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "A: Helen H. Waterford.",
        "A: April 14th, 1909.",
        "A: In Germany.",
        "A: Sure. My...I was born in a...in a smaller town across the river from Frankfurt on the Rhine.\nAnd when I was about 3 or 4 years old, my parents moved to Frankfurt. It was very\nunfortunate that, uh, my father was born in Lithuania and had difficulty to get permission to\nstay in Germany in Offenbach. I do not know why. I only know that we had to move to\nFrankfurt. 1914, the first World War started. I was 5 years old and the laws in Germany are\nstill the same, that the wife and the offspring takes the, uh, well, is is the same citizen of a\ncountry as a father. So my mother, who was German...her family was there for\ncenturies....and I, we became all of a sudden Russians because Lithuania belonged to Russia\nat the time. And as Russians, we were the enemies of Germany, and we would have been\ninterned if we couldn't live with my grandparents who at this time came from a very small\ntown in Germany...1n Germany. They're quite old. We thought at that time old. And, uh, my\naunt, my mother's sister, had taken them tn into their building and so we shared their\nquarters. And we were not register...registered at the police which meant like living\nunderground, illegally. All this naturally was not told to me. I was much too small to\nunderstand that, but I do know that when I was 6 years old, I was supposed to go to school,\nand it was not possible to go to a public school because my citizenship was Russian. And,\nuh, there was a Jewish school, an excellent Jewish school, liberal, and my mother talked to\nthe director and he understood and let me come in without birth certificate or whatever. That\nwas the school I started when I was 6. It was absolutely a fantastic school as I found out later\nin the years. And, um, it was so broad-minded and we learned so, so...everything so much,\nuh, so directly, so uh intensively. The school was in two buildings and were connected. One\nwere girls and one were boys. And, uh, it did not happen before we were maybe 13 or 14 that\nwe were brought together with the boys. Even some of them naturally one had already seen,\nand, eh, in between the hours, but boys and girls in the same class at the same age were taken\nby the teachers to outings, which I thought was a very good idea and everybody liked it. Uh,\nI was in this school until I was 18 years old. Because when I was 16 and I thought it was the\nend, they added the three classes that you could go in there if you wanted to go to the\nuniversity...you wanted to go on. That's what I did.",
        "A: I couldn't tell you, because I thought everybody was Jewish. In some way I was not aware\nthat the children I was playing on the streets with were neighbors that they were not Jewish,\nbecause all the children I knew were Jewish. Frankfurt is a big city and, uh, was a big city at\nthat time too. It...I was... was thinking I was living in a Jewish world. We were not that very\nreligious. We were liberals, as it was called in Germany. And my parents went to the high\nholidays to the synagogue. We didn't live far from synagogue and, uh, there was no Sunday\nschool because most of the things we had in school. We had very little Hebrew lessons, but\nwe did uh have the Rabbi teaching us the history of the Jews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, I... In 1933, I got married. I met...I met him the year before, but I, uh, I had..I had to\nwork uh besides going to school, to finance it. There were no loans at this time, and my\nparents were not that happily financially to afford that. And I, 1t came out, I made very good\nmoney, so I was in a situation to support myself and help my parents. So I decided I wouldn't\nget married. Why should I get married? I saw no reasons. And, uh...I had a boyfriend\nbecause just everybody had to have a boyfriend. It was the, uh, style. But, uh, all of a\nsudden...I had known him from school as I said in this school where we were. The school's\nname is Philanthropin, 1f somebody would ever hear that. Phianthropin was unique and, um,\nit was a shame that it didn't never come back in any shape or form. Uh...I decided I didn't\nwant to get married. After he did not want to get married to me, so I was jilted...and the sour\ngrapes, were I don't get married. And I could travel, and I was traveling to, um, um, to the\nseashore. There was an island\u2019 where most of the people who came there in summer were\nJewish because the next island did not allow Jews. So the Jews had their own places, and so\nthat's where I went. And on the second day I was there, I met the man I married later.\u201d I did\nnot want even to talk to him because he thought...he looked as if he was 18 years old. I was\n23 already. I was absolutely not interested, but he was very persistent and I found out that he\nwas 28 so that made things a little easier. (laughs) And he came also from Frankfurt. So we\ngot married after Hitler took power, which was in January 30th, 1933. He had lost already\nhis job and we...but I still had my income, and we got married with the intention to leave the\ncountry. We were married by the way by the Orthodox Rabbi who married my parents and\nhis parents. And, um, we left Germany in 1934 going to Holland.\nNorderney, one of the German Frisian islands in the North Sea.\n* Siegfried Wohlfarth.",
        "A: Now, the trip to Holland...the preparations of leaving Germany at that time so very early was\na little different than it became later. We could took take everything with us. And he had a\njob there. He was a CPA. He had gotten a job there. I couldn't work there - didn't get any\npermit, being not Dutch. And, uh, I tried to learn the language which is um not so easy. It is\nmore of a throat thickness, it seemed to me, than a language. I got used to it because I wanted\nto speak it. I wanted to make friends, and I had nothing to do. I started without really, uh,\nthinking about - it a business. I. . .Now, at first I have to say I got pregnant, and we found\nout that we would have a very hard time to live on the salary he had and ...with a child you\nknow. So I want...I had to think of something...how to make some money to make it easier.\nSo I was helping the people who moved to Holland from Germany to settle down and I did\neverything they would need to uh find a place to live, to furnish the place, because they\nhad...mostly couldn't bring much furniture anymore. I wanted to make it easier for them, and\nI wanted to make some money on it. Which I did. It developed later in a. . into..an interior\ndecorator business and the people I had as customers before told it to other people, and it\nwas very successful. But that was 37, that's when my daughter was born. Then, in 1938,\ncame the uh the night of the broken glass, on November 9th, and, uh, my mother called from\nFrankfurt and told me that my father and my brother were arrested and uh, what we could\ndo. Now my father had been arrested a few months before, and we got him a visa to come to\nHolland. It was very difficult, but when he had the visa he did decide not to go. He was\nconvinced without any...he couldn't yet even say why...that uh 1t would be over soon, and\nthere was no reason for him to leave Germany. So he stayed. My brother was 18 years old\nand, uh, he was arrested. And he came to Buchenwald. But when my father was arrested, the\nman who looked at his passport, the stateless one, and he saw he had a visa to come to\nHolland and he said to him, \"You're an idiot that you stayed here. I'll take your passport. I'll\nmeet you tomorrow morning on the train to Amsterdam.\" And this my mother told me that\nhe was coming the next day. My brother and my brother-in-law, my husband's brother, we\nall got them out to Holland or to England, where we had relatives and we couldn't go. And\nthe the invasion came to Holland, which was in May of 1940, my parents, all of them, all of\nthis family, was already in the United States. And we had no chance! My father, as uh the\nman from, you know, from Russia, he uh could have...he could come into the United States\non a visa from this part because at that time there was nobody using a visa to go to the\nUnited States. If they would have had to wait for a German visa, I mean German bek, they\nwould have never made it because the United States did not give all the visas they legally\nwere obliged and was as possible to give, but they only gave half or less. So...so I...this way\nmy father, my mother, and my brother got into the United States.",
        "A: Where? What? What I did do at what time?",
        "A: No. I don't..I never got...I told you I was working as an interior decorator.",
        "A: And that was over the moment Hitler came. Nothing doing. Hoping that we would get out,\nbut which was not possible. So we, uh...we were waiting what the Nazis were doing. My\nhusband had just lost his job right away, and our child was three years old when the Nazis\ncame and was five years old when we got the order to um appear at the train station in\nAmsterdam at 1:30 at night to allow us to bring one suitcase a person and the key to the\nhouse. This was a. . .a strange order. We didn't understand what really would happen to us,\nand all our friends came and we gathered in the house and talked- \"What shall we do?\" All\nthe same age. We were five couples. We all had come from Germany, and each of us had a\nlittle girl about the same age. From all those people, all those couples with each one child,\nthe only one who came back...the only ones who were alive was one man, was my daughter\nand me. We lost them all. And, uh, we...my husband and I, we decided we go to the Jewish\nCouncil. I assume you are familiar with what the Jewish Council was in each city. So in\nAmsterdam was a very large Jewish Council and we bought our order and asked, \"What is\nthis? Where are we going? What does it mean?\" And we were...we were not the only ones\nwho came. Everybody was confused. And uh we were told that we were going to a family\ncamp to work and that we should take our children. We hadn't asked about children, but they\nsaid, \"Take your children because they will be taken care of while you work.\" We left this\nbuilding and I decided to tell my husband that I am not for going on the July 15th to get that\ntrain. And we, being brought up in Germany, which is a little different than other countries\num had a hard time to accept that. My husband said, \"We cannot do that. This is an order,\nblack and white. Who knows what they will do to us if we don't go?\" I said, \"Who knows\nwhat they do to us when we are going? We don't know. We don't know where we are going.\nAnd why? Because Jewish, but (cough) what other reason?\" So we decided that my husband\nshould get a surgery to give us some time. And he found a willing doctor to take out (cough,\ncough.) excuse me...to take out his appendix which was very healthy. So we got two weeks\nthat he could recover and then we would be getting another order. In those two weeks I've\nheard that everybody who is working in any capacity for the Jewish Council would get a\nstamp and a paper that they are at this moment free of deport. . .deportation and so I got a job\nas a cook in an old people's home. I worked there from 7 in the morning. I cooked for\neverybody. There were 40 people there. And I...if...1f. . they paid me five-something like\nfive dollars a week it was a lot. Anyway, I worked there.. I worked there maybe six weeks. I.\n. . really can't say. In the meantime, my husband had recovered and uh still we did need\nsomebody at home that my daughter was not even 5 years old. Somebody had to be there\nsince I was practically gone all the time, and, uh, the day I came...I came one morning and\nthe doors were open, and the whole place was in a terrible condition and everybody was\ngone, and most of them were on stretchers. It was a weary feeling. The people were all\nfinancially in a very good shape. I don't know what was lying around or so or what they\ntook. I run out of the house because I thought, \"Maybe there's some of those guys left, and\nthen they'll take me.\" And they were all gone. So then I was sure, it was not work we were\nsent to when they take those old people. But we had no other way to go any place because\nwe were not allowed to be on the street at night. We had to wear. . wear our star. We uh\ncould not take public transportation. We had to walk wherever we were going in this big\ncity. We, uh, had special hours of purchasing our food. Everything was very, very difficult so\nyou had no telephone any more. You had no connection. You just...that's a feeling...so we\nstay home and they will probably pick us up. That's all we can do. In...",
        "A: Ja. Maybe. (drinks water) Ja. Early October, 1942, a very close friend of ours, we knew him\nfor many years and, was a neighbor and, was one of those couples. This was a man who\nlived through it. He came and he said...he was married to a school friend of mine. I got them\ntogether. It was wonderful. So he said that he had somebody who was helping them to live\nunderground and their child would be in a different place if we would like to consider that.\nNaturally, we said...and though...and the next day this man came to us. His name was Joe\nVis. He is the...the Gentile who is named with all the others who were helping me in my\nbook. It's really written for them. He [Jo] came and said that they were all blue collar\nworkers and they belonged to uh a very liberal small church. They didn't have much money,\nbut they wanted to help as much as they could and they said, \"It is easier 1f you are not\ntogether with your child, because she cannot stay inside what you have to do. We do not\nknow how long the war will be. We have a place for a child if you want to give her up. I\nwould suggest you do.\" We certainly agreed, and a few days later he came back with a\ncouple.\u2019 We did not know their name and we did not know where they were living. We\nfound out after the war that this woman was his sister, but we didn't know. And they came\nSunday afternoon and we walked together to the street car with my daughter and gave it to\nher...to them. And, uh, we...this man, Joe Vis, he had the days before already with his wife\neveryday picked up things for Doris, my daughter, toys, her bed, her doll house...was there\nwaiting for her, and, uh, he said, \"Maybe in a few weeks we will have something for you too.\nIt's more difficult to get two people a home again.\" So...he...but he got it. About three or four\nweeks later he came and he had a place\u201d and we, uh, he uh...we had two metal beds, so he\ntook those two and brought it where we were going because the people had no beds for us.\nAnd some pillow cases and so on. But I have to say in 1941, one year before, my husband\nwho was very far thinking had said, \"You know, we should prepare our child that she's not\ndepending on us. We don't know - maybe there will be a transport for children to the United\nStates, which never happened because United States did not take the 20,000 children they\nwant to send. Or to England. We should be uh less warm with her, that she will never miss\nus. No hugging, no kissing. But she should be...it should be easier for her not to miss us. And\n* Joe Vis and his wife, Agaat, were instrumental in aiding Helen and Sigfried.\n* Dirk and Stien DeBoers.\n> In Zaandam, an industrial town located just outside Amsterdam.\nthat's what we started, a year before. Also, another friend\u2019 took from our house things we\nthought maybe we should put away. He offered it. And we gave him all our books. It was the\nmost important thing. And the typewriter. But also silver and clothes and bed sheets and\nshoes and all those things. We had no idea what he would do with it. We did not ask. And uh\nso when when we left the house and to go into this illegal place there was furniture and all\nthat was there. And we very optimistic. We even paid the rent for this apartment until we\nfound out that the Germans had emptied it completely, which was maybe eight months after\nthat. And, uh, the, uh...this man who took all our things, we had a contract with him that he\nhad bought our furniture and that he had paid us so much for the furniture that and he got a\nreceipt from the Germans that they had taken out the furniture that belonged to him, and\nwhen the war was over, he got the money.\u2019 He'd give to us, because that wasn't a serious\ncontract. It wasn't true. He hadn't bought it. But the furniture and everything was gone\nnaturally. And, uh, we were living underground from October 1942 til August 1944 in\ndifferent homes because people got very scared very often. Sometimes wanted us to leave\nthe same day. Some places we were two or three months until they got so scared. The place\nwhere we were last [Haarlem] we were eleven months and we thought for sure this will bring\nus to the end because by that time the uh Allies already had invaded in France and things\nlooked very good. Thinking in two, three weeks they must be in Holland and then in\nAugust...on August 26, 1944, the day that Paris was liberated by the Allies, that was the day\nwe were arrested.",
        "A: The uh the people in whose house we lived...she was uh a woman with three teenage\ndaughters. Her husband, as she said, had left...left her when the youngest one was born. She\ndid not have much money, and, uh, the girls were very nice. She was okay. She...she\nprepared our dinner and...cause this is something very important...how one lives. Two people\nalone in a room for such a long time. She prepared our dinner, and we had the, uh, coupons\nthat she could buy food because without the coupons you couldn't live. Our friends from this\nchurch came every second Saturday and brought us coupons. The coupons were stolen every\nmonth in the distribution centers by another person. All around Holland for the 20,000\npeople in Holland who were hiding. When the war was over, it was only 10,000. The others\nwere found. And uh they brought us everything we wanted. Any book and we just had to\nwrite it down and they tried to get us the books and they brought it. And they told us also\nwhat, how the war was going because we were cut off from the world because they were\nlistening to the BBC. If you are caught to listen to the BBC in London, you were executed.\n\u00b0 Ab Reusink.\n\"Two years and several months later, when a special department of the occupational forces arrived,\nAb Reusink protested that Helen and Seigfried's furniture were his belongings. Reusink produced\nthe three-year-old contract that he had drawn up originally. Thus, the Germans paid Reusink the\namount of the contract, which he then turned over to Helen and Seigfried.\nThey did it, and they told us what was going to happen. What was going on and how well we\nwere doing, we heard it from them. They also told us in July of 1944, that there were six\nextermination camps only in Poland. Only. And there was one...it was the largest one. It was\nAuschwitz. And by that time two million Jews already had been gassed. They were telling\nthat and, uh, it was very upsetting naturally. And everybody was hopeful, very, very hopeful\nthat the end was coming. So on this day when we were arrested, we were brought to the\nGestapo. Oh, I have to say when those men came- there were four men- two Germans and\ntwo Dutch, and two of them were downstairs at the front and back door, and two of them\ncame up to our room. They knocked on the door, they were very well mannered, and they\nsaid that we were arrested. They looked at the little belongings we had. They saw a picture of\nour daughter on the wall, because our friends brought us always picture to show what she\nwas looking because she had gone to...going to school and then she was very happy where\nshe was. And she looked happy. Uh, the one man said, \"If this 1s your child, and if you have\nmore children in hiding, we recommend that you take them with you because you are going\ninto a family camp.\" Here it comes back, the same what the Jewish Council had said. And\nyou will be...they will be taken care of while you are working. And my husband and I, we\ndidn't even have to look at each other, we didn't answer that. Then, they announ...the other\nman said, \"Why don't you take some warm clothes with you. Where you are going it is very\ncold.\" That was true. But we decided that we would take nothing. We went completely\nwithout luggage, knowing that we probably would come to Auschwitz because this was in\nsome way called a punishment that we did not follow the first time...that we had to be\npunished for that, so it could only have been Auschwitz. And, uh, the, uh, the, uh...one, one\nand half day interrogation by the Gestapo was mostly about giving the names of the people\nwho brought us those cards, because they had no idea who was breaking in and getting those\ntickets, and it must have been a very large circle.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: How do you know?\n[some technical conversation |",
        "A: I know. I know. A lot of things didn't come through . . .",
        "A: I wish [ had. . .\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: What I knew about my daughter was this friend, Jo Vis, who was the original helper and he\ndidn't live too far from there. He was very often there to look himself at children. But, uh,\nin..at that time before...oh, maybe a year before we were arrested, Jo Vis had in his house\nalways people until he found for them another place. So one day there was a man staying\nwith them who had been on the black list because he was in the war in Spain. And uh he was\non the black list and he was hiding there waiting for a better place, and they were all arrested.\nHe and his wife and there were two friends of ours who came through us to him were there.\nThey all got arrested. His wife was pregnant at the time. They let her go home to three\nchildren. Uh. .. Everybody else was, uh, sent out. He went to Dachau. He went...he lived\nthrough the war. He happened to become a cook and he came home very well looking.\n(laugh) So, uh...but the two women were deported to Bergen-Belsen. And this was the next\nman in line, his name was Rinus,\u00b0 a wonderful man. Um, he was a gardener of the town, but\nhe was very, very well-informed about everything. He was self taught man. And he brought\nall the books my husband wrote down he wanted, because my husband was writing how the\nworld should be after the war. And in every way, in financial, in religious, 1n ethical, in any\nkind of way how the world should be. So he got the books he wanted every time when Rinus\ncame. And, uh, he also visited where my daughter was, because this is the district where all\nthe people who helped us were living, and he told us how happy she was, how wonderful she\nwas doing in school. She was well. There was really no reason to worry about her. The...the\nwoman...her foster mother, or whatever you would call it, was sick...I think for three weeks\nin the hospital. Another couple took over and took her in. They told us that afterwards. But\nshe was in the best of hands. And though I didn't worry about her. Since we did not see her.\nWe didn't...we didn't know ourselves where she was. It would have been very easy to get to\nher through all the others, but we never said, we never gave a name about the people who\nwere visiting us. We just didn't answer.",
        "A: To the..head.. headquarters of the Gestapo in Amsterdam. We were in Haarlem. And\n* Rinus Hille, a man who had been very active in efforts to save the Jews.\neverybody said, \"such a beautiful city.\" And I said, \"I've never seen it.\" They took us to..to\nAmsterdam, to the headquarters, and, uh, questioned separate, always. Questioned and\nquestioned and questioned. Sometimes they got very impatient. They did not hit us. They did\nnot touch us. They were very angry. It's very difficult to fight against somebody who doesn't\nreact. It's very difficult, and, uh...1n some way, we had uh given up that... that we would ever\nbe living. In some way, we were already on the way to die. And we accepted that this is it.\nThere was nothing you can do, and we didn't want to get anybody else in. We had no\ninterest.",
        "A: Yes, that's that's what they wanted. That's the people who brought there, the people who\nvisited, maybe... We didn't even answer. There was nothing there which would have shown\nthat we were in any contact, but on the wall there was a map of Europe and what we heard\nfrom them where the uh Allies were, we put pins. That was there. But I think those guys\nwere so ignorant that we didn't even see that. We were never asked, \"How do you know?\"\nBecause it was not in the paper, but you got it from, from London. Never asked. Uh, uh.\nComing...ja...in this house was also a lady living...a seamstress\u2019 with her mother, older\nmother, and this was a spinster who was making dresses. And I got very close to her. She\nlived, she and her mother lived on the second floor and I sat down very often- we talked. She\nwas about my age and I still correspond with her. So when we left going down the steps, she\nwas at the steps and I had in my hand a coral pin I had gotten from my mother-in-law. I had\na very wonderful relationship to my mother-in-law...very. And, uh, I put it in her hands when\nI said goodbye, and, uh, that was that. We never saw the woman, her so called hostess or her\nthree daughters. Nobody was there. And, uh, they brought us . . .after this time at the\nheadquarters, they brought us for two days to the Amsterdam Jail which was very nice. I\nwould have always liked to (laugh) stay there and wait for the end of the war. It was clean\nand, uh, it was very nice. But there were only two days and then they brought us, always in\nthe night, in street cars to the station and we were brought to Westerbork which was the\ntransit camp in Holland.",
        "A: I've never thought about that any more. I've never thought..that . .they were German soldiers.\nIt was a regular train. It was a regular train and German soldiers. We had no luggage. There\nwas no problem with us. We didn't talk. That's all. It's very...uh. . There was a big surprise to\nme when we came to Westerbork, about seeing all those people...so many friends we hadn't\nseen in years. They were there. And the green uniforms. Especially some women in those\nuniform. They looked chic, sexy. I...I didn't know...I said, \"Who 1s that?\" (laughs) They were\nall prisoners and they had some kind of work to do. I don't know...I was not long enough in\n\u201d Gre Orlessen.\nWesterbork to find out how really those relations were. I have read some books afterwards\nabout Westerbork, and, uh..",
        "A: It was a foreign world. Completely! The people who had been there for years, they took for\ngranted that this was the right thing, where they would be. And as I said, we met good\nfriends. We met a man there who lived...who had rented a room at the Frank's house, at their\napartment, and we knew him very well because we introduced him to the one daughter of\nfriends of ours and they got married. Now his wife was at that time when Jo Vis was\narrested...was there. They had no place for her, and so she came to Bergen-Belsen. Where he\nwent, I don't know, because the train where we...were leaving was about two days later and\nwas the last train to Auschwitz because then the strike came in Holland. The announcement\nthat the uh Allies would come to Holland, and the Germans knew that too, and they emptied\nWesterbork. There were only 300 people left . . .I didn't want- wish to be there to fight out\nwho would be the 300. And, uh, our. . .our train...our cattle train went to Auschwitz. We\nwere sure...we didn't know when we were came there that it was Auschwitz but in our mind\nsince we had heard that this camp existed, that we were punished...punished for our hiding\nand whatever, that that was the place where we were going.",
        "A: A nightmare. A real nightmare. Um, the train was overloaded with people, and, uh, we were,\nI would judge maybe a hundred and fifty people. There was no room to sit. We had to stand.\nI don't know how it was in others because I..I always didn't want to talk to people and ask in\ncamp how was it. We...uh...we were standing and, uh, a lot of people died...old\npeople...babies. No water. No food. No light. No air. And no toilet facilities. And next to me\nwas a woman who had a little child with her, a little girl, and she uh told me that the people\nwho came to arrest them from in the hiding places said the same thing with the same words\nas the Jewish Council said...as those guys said who arrested us, \"Take your children with\nyou.\" And she did. So I thought maybe I did something wrong. Maybe I did not really\nbelieve that there maybe would be a chance to have the child with you. So they took us...was\na three and a half day trip, and, uh, (long pause) twice the car stopped and the soldiers came\nin and they took our watches one time, and then they wanted our money telling us that the\nmoney wasn't worth anything. Where we were going we should give our money, and my\nhusband decided...we had our money in belt, money belt. We had that on, it on all those\nyears. And he didn't give anything. So when they closed again, we started to rip up this\nmoney...thousands of guilders. Wasn't easy to do. It's a physical step, also to rip it in little\npieces. But we did. I don't know- it was stupid probably, but we did it. And, uh, we arrived in\nthe middle of the night, the fourth night and was...you know, bright lights, and the doors\nopened, and the blue and white striped prisoners which were the prisoners from Kanada\nwhich we did not know Kanada existed. They looked very clean, starched uniforms. They'd\nnever answer any questions. We said, \"Where are we?\" No questions. Just getting the\nluggage out. And all the people had brought with them, half households. It was all gone and\npeople, I'm sure it was at every train the same were very upset, and they always got\npromised, \"We bring it to you where you are. We know where you will be.\" And, uh, at least\nwe didn't have to go through that. The woman and the child and I were together when we\nstarted to move in rows after we were separated from the men. And we walked...the ramp\nwas endless. I don't know how long, how many cars there were, but it seemed endless and\nthere was the man standing who made the decision who shall live or who shall die, but we\ndid not know that. He looked at the three of us and he asked me if that was my child, and I\nsaid no, and he made the movement with the thumb for one side to go for me and to the other\nside for this woman and her child, and I assumed that she had that privilege because they\nwere taking care of the children. And, uh, this man was very good looking. I have never\nforgotten the look of Dr. Mengele because I found out the next day it was Mengele. There\nwere more doctors than Mengele to do that since it was 24 hours going, train after train. But\nthis was Mengele, and, uh, he was very good looking, and, uh, his uniform and his boots. He\nwas just a perfect specimen of a man. And, uh, somebody had said, you know, when...a few\nmonths..few years ago when there was so much about Mengele, \"Would you recognize\nhim?\" I said, \"No, I'm sure not.\" The way he looked then at his height and, how can you? So\nhe to the aside, he sent me, it was the side of life, and the other was the side of death, as I\nheard the next day also. And, uh, there were no Jewish children in Auschwitz, just a few Dr.\nMengele wanted. Otherwise, there were no Jewish children. And the mothers were killed\nwith them when they had the mother. Uh, I have met...before I forget that and I come to it, I\nmet a woman who was with us in the barrack. A young woman. A very beautiful looking\nwoman. She was very depressed. And after..I had very . .[ had hardly any contact with her.\nAll of a sudden she said to me, \"You know what I did? I knew they would kill the children,\nand I let my children go,\" and uh she said, \"I couldn't help him them because I would be\nkilled too.\" She knew all that. She said, \"I heard it maybe two days before I was on the train\nand I let my children go.\" I don't know what happened to her. I don't know how she lived\nthrough it. I wish she would be living and that she could have children again. I don't know.\nBut that...went with me for many, many years. How do you live with that? The, uh, the side\nwhere we were, we were told to wait, and then came my husband who was also sent to this\ngood side, and we talked for a long time until the women were called into a large, a very\nlarge room. And I must say when we were walking to this place in the woods I heard voices.\nI heard women speak. I heard dogs and I heard music. And I said to the other women I said,\n\"I thought we would come to Auschwitz where they kill everybody. This is life. We are\ncoming into life. You hear the noises? You don't have to worry.\" So, uh, we were called into\nthat room and we got first our tatoo, and the girls who gave that were sitting at a long table\non a wall and they all were wearing black satin dresses. Not the same dress, but the same\nmaterial, and their hair was beautiful, long. Young women, very, very attractive women.\nAnd they had a book, and they put our name in and then they gave our tatoo and then we\nwere with them going into a circle of soldiers with big dogs and then we had to take off our\nclothes, strip. The one who stripped me, helped me stripping, took at the same time my\nwedding band off my finger. I had forgotten I had it. Maybe I would have tried to put it in\nmy mouth or whatever. I didn't know. So she took it and, uh, I still thought they were\nGermans. I did not understand that they were Jewish prisoners. So they helped us and they\nfound out...tried to find if we had jewelry hidden some other places and, uh, they shaved us,\nour head hair and our body hair. They left our shoes because that day no wooden shoes had\ncome. I heard, um, Anne Frank's mother who was with us. And I knew the Franks. And I did\nnot know that they had been arrested shortly before us, so I didn't know that. So I heard her\ndiscussing with one of those women...the woman..and she was with one daughter...no...she\nwas with two daughters. There she was with two daughters... And ,uh, the woman said she\nshould give her her shoes, and...and Mrs. Frank hesitated, and the girl said, \"I bring you\nevery day soup for your two daughters if you give me your shoes and I give you mine.\" And\nshe was very naive and she did this. She never got a drop of soup. The woman who was\nhandling me also said that...that must have been before or the same time...I don't know\nanymore. She said, \"You have good shoes on.\" I said, \"Yes, I am very glad I have good\nshoes on.\" She said, \"Would you like to change with me?\" I said, \"No.\" That's it. And then\nwe came under the cold shower and then we were outside the house and we got a dress, uh a\n. .dress. It could have been chiffon or it could have been wool. It could have been a size 10 or\nit could have been a size 25. It made no difference. I got a dress and we went to the barrack\nfor the night. That was all happening in the morning when we arrived during the night..all\nthat took the to the other night. We still didn't get to eat. We still couldn't go to the latrine. In\nthe meantime it was a latrine. And we were, uh brought to the barrack and we were\nexhausted. Absolutely exhausted. And I had a dream which was with me for many years and,\nuh, I dreamt that I was coming home and I was telling my family and my friends the strange\nthings that had happened to me this day, this weeks, I don't know anymore. Probably the\nmost upsetting was this being changed into a different person with losing your hair, losing\neverything you had, just as you are born. I think that was the greatest shock. You couldn't see\nyourself, but you saw the others, so you knew what you were looking like. I think it was the\ngreatest shock for all of us, because nobody menstruated anymore. That was over. And our\nyoung girls, we had a lot of young girls, we had the whole uh orphanage of Jewish girls from\nParis, girls of 15 years old, and they came from Morocco, and they were brought to Paris,\nand they were all taken, and we had them all. Beautiful girls. Fifteen years old. All they\ncould speak was their own language. They had nothing else. They couldn't talk to anybody\nelse. They were very upset when they were not menstruating. Everybody very young was uh\nconcerned, but then it was a blessing. What would we have done? We had nothing. We had\nno underwear. We had nothing.",
        "A: Sure.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: Ja.",
        "A: Ja, and the dream. The dream that I came home and are telling my experiences- with the\ntatoo, and with the losing the hair, and uh losing everything we had and everybody said,\n\"This is impossible. You are dreaming, just a heavy dream-- that cannot happen to anybody.\"\nThe strange thing is, I read many years later the book Night and he talks about people who\ncame back and the people said he must have lost his mind. That was years later and so I'm\nnot the only one who had such dreams. I think there are more people who have dreams on\nthis kind, but I didn't have a...for a certain time and then it was over, that dream. Um...",
        "A: Yes, I am in the barrack. We had 10 or 12 people in a bunk, and it was in the middle of the\nnight when we came, so it was very short time that we could sleep. When the morning came\nand the first day in Auschwitz started, was a roll call. Roll call in Auschwitz I'm sure that\neverybody had about the same experience...that's uh the barrack elder was counting\neverybody, we were standing with five in...and I always, always...I don't know why... tried to\nstand exactly in the middle. Not in front, not in the back, and not on the side. I wanted to be\nlittle and short and not being seen. I don't know why. Later on, I found that the women who\nwere tall were always picked to special things. They were not always good. So I didn't want\nto be picked for anything. I didn't want to be there. So, uh, we were counted but every roll\ncall, every roll call was wrong. It never came out that we were as many people as they had\nhad on their books. And the women got very...those women, those barrack elder, were very\nupset about it. They were also very beautiful dressed, with black dresses. Uh, I still didn't\nknow that they were prison, Jewish prisoners. It didn't dawn on me that they would be\nprisoners. Look at us and look at them. And, uh, then came the SS men to check it, and that\ndidn't work out. So he was very angry, and they were worried and they looked through the\nbarrack and they found people who were hiding under the mattresses and they were found\npeople who had died, and though they put them all there on the floor and counted them, and I\nthink then maybe they were then, uh, accepting the numbers. I don't know. Even they mostly\nspoke German and I tried always to understand what they were saying, it was difficult. When\nthis roll call was over, then volunteers had to go to the kitchen to get the coffee. And it was\nin big barrels and you had to carry them with uh sticks, and uh I felt so strong and so healthy,\nI always volunteered. I don't know why. I guess I was curious to see what the kitchen looked\nlike. I think that was it. You didn't see much because you never had...got into the kitchen and\nmost of the people who worked tn the kitchen were born in Poland and spoke Polish and, uh,\nfor long times before all that happened, there was always uh, uh, another world in between\nthe Germans and the Eastern Jews and that was in Auschwitz also. Maybe even stronger, that\ndidn't dawn on me first either. Eh... Maybe stronger because there were so many Polish\nwomen who had been there or some other camp and ghettos for a long time already. This\nwas '44. They started in 39. So, uh, they had so called jobs, and when somebody came, new\nin, who had been hiding or so, they always had a job for them. Always. They got...we never\nsaw them again. They got help. We didn't...I didn't...I didn't know anybody. I came with a\nDutch group, and I was considered to be Dutch because I spoke Dutch with them. The Dutch\nwomen were uh very unfortunate because they could never adjust, practically. They, uh, died\nlike the flies, especially in Auschwitz. And, uh, I didn't understand that. I met the Hungarian\nwomen who had come a few months before us. Very intelligent, very...also attractive\nwomen. They were at that...1n this camp I was...it was uh, Birkenau B-2, uh, they were the\nkeepers of the latrines, and the washrooms, and I uh washing...I don't know for some reason I\nthought I just have to wash every day and they were not always open, but I got friendly with\nthem and I could come in. Now washing 1s a big work because we had high, uh, uh, wash\nstands on high heels and you had to climb in there and then there was come cold water. That\nwas all. And then you put your dress on again. But it gave me a very good feeling that I had\ndone that. I felt...I felt I needed that. And, uh, the Dutch women said to me, \"You are crazy.\nThe next thing is you get pneumonia. How can you go under that cold water? You get\npneumonia.\" I said, \"Maybe there is some loose dirt because it's already you know some...a\nwhole day, but whatever there is, I feel good.\" They didn't go. It was not very comfortable\nclimbing, but also the friendship I had with the...with the women from Hungary helped me to\nget in and have some time to talk to them. The same with uh the latrine was closed at many\nhours. I could always get in. And, uh, we...we became good friends. They were much\nyounger than I was.",
        "A: In. . .in Auschwitz?",
        "A: Nothing regular. Nothing regular. We were going sometimes with carts, with two wheel\ncarts to . . into the woods and cut out some grass, squares, and brought them to a place where\nthe soldiers were living and then they put that cut grass. We, uh, moved sometimes bricks on\nthose things back and forth from one corner to the other- the it was not regular, and, uh, I do\nremember that we...when we were carrying those bricks back and forth... Oh no, that was...\nthat was later. That was not in Auschwitz. That was in the camp I was.",
        "A: Ja. You know it came to me that we had those carts there too. That's how it brought it\ntogether. No, we didn't, uh, we didn't have regular things to do. We went to the station\nsometimes and moved stones. Nothing special. We had two more selections with Dr.\nMengele, only that was in the barrack. Many times during the day, there was all of a sudden\na signal that everybody had to go back to the barrack, close the door, couldn't be out. So we\nfound out that this was the day when one of the doctors came because one day we had it. We\nwere going out, but with us it, it was Mengele again and we took off our dress and in the\nnude we marched in front of him and he makes the same signs, to the right or to the left. In\nthat case there was in the uh barrack a small room where the ones who were to be killed\nwere settled and we could go. But by that time we knew what it meant because I had met a\nman walking through the camp. I walked around a lot to look. I was always a curious person.\nI wanted to see what's going on here. And I saw a man, the only man I saw in the camp, and\nhe was Polish also. He had a triangle. And he was a criminal as I found out later, a black\ntriangle, and, uh, I asked him. I spoke German, I tried Dutch. He spoke Polish. We talked\ntogether. And, uh, I asked him where we were. And he said, \"You are not in Auschwitz.\nYou're in Birkenau.\" And Birkenau, he said, \"You see that chimney there, its smoking. Don't\never think that you come out alive here. This is the way we are going to heaven, through the\nchimney. And that little house next to it is where the gas is.\" It was a few days there-- very\nshort time. And, uh, I was always wondering what is this man walk around in this camp? The\nbooks I have read, the many, many books of people who had been in Auschwitz...I assume\nnow that this man was looking for a woman...because we had women who uh had some boy-\nfriends coming into and bring...bringing them gifts, food, clothes. I don't know what. But I\ndo remember that very much.",
        "A: From the other camp. From a work camp. Those were people who were already in camp for\nyears. They were maybe kapos. I don't know. They could go. Whatever they were. They\nwere not Jewish, but uh they looked for, you know, for the . . .the new women because they\nwere still nice and, uh, we had one woman from, who was from Berlin. She was a prostitute.\nShe had told me when we were 1n jail. She had told me that she was a prostitute. And that\nshe's Jewish, and, uh, I never saw her there anyway. But there were women who were ready\nfor whatever they could get to be with men where and how I don't know. But this came...not\nat that moment...I was thinking of that, of that guy who was there. He was clean dressed,\nwell-dressed, and good boots which was the most important thing.",
        "A: Ja. Outside.",
        "A: No. Outside.",
        "A: We were all outside. Yes. And we walked by.",
        "A: No. I only know that they had to go into the barrack to the a little side room. Maybe it was a\nroom where the elder was sleeping. You know she had a separate room. It could be. I don't\nknow. What..ja, that was the second time. There were a mother and a daughter with us. The\ndaughter was 15. You know, you...when you are under 16, you should have gone to the other\nside...so she was 15, and the mother was taken. So this girl was with us to the end. And\neverybody was trying to replace the mother. It was a Dutch girl, but I don't know what\nhappened to her.",
        "A: A third selection started in the same way, with Mengele also. And then..there he...they\ncounted 300 women. And to me it was clear that this would go to work.",
        "A: To work. That meant...and because we had no other job. It was already two months that we\nhad no..nothing to do, just wait from one meal to another. And it wasn't bad, the food there in\nAuschwitz. It wasn't enough, but it was not bad. Ja. The bread was excellent. They baked\nvery good bread, and, uh, ja...the . . the bread soldiers get. Brown, blackish bread. Very\ngood. It was never enough, naturally. And there was always something under that big piece\nof bread. It, uh, was a wedge. And there was uh on there uh sometimes cottage cheese,\nsometimes uh some uh jelly, marmalade, a piece of sausage. Not all together. That was one\nmeal, and uh we got that so-called coffee which only looked like a black mess, and, uh, then\nthe second meal we go, probably ja, mostly soup. But we had nothing to eat with so we had\nto share a bowl of soup with, with four people. And, uh,",
        "A: Ja. We were counted 300 people, and as I said, I assumed we're going to work. Mrs. Frank\nwas in those 300 with Anna, but her daughter...was other daughter\u2019\u201d was not there. She was\nin quarantine. She had some skin eruptions. Germans were very much afraid of skin get\ncontagious or so. So she was in quarantine and Mrs. Frank said, \"I'm not going with you\nwherever you're going if you're going uh because I wait until Margot comes back.\" That's\nwhat she did. She disappeared during the night...went into another barrack and, uh, came to\nBergen-Bel. She didn't come...she died before she came to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: Now uh, I knew them before and, uh, uh, Mr. Frank was a typical German officer in his\n'\u00ae Margot Frank.\nstand. A very correct, very bright man. Had an excellent relationship with Anna. She had a\nmuch better relationship with him than with her mother. And, uh, Anna was a very quiet\ngirl...liked to write as everybody knows and, uh, Mrs. Frank was, as she did the dealing with\nher shoes, which is, you know, a small thing, when we came that she...that she changed the\nshoes. It showed in some way that it was very difficult for her to see the real place where we\nwere. The reality, what, what could happen, what, what is happening. And, uh, Margaret was\na very attractive girl. More attractive than Anne. But Anne was a lovely girl but she never\ntalked much. They were...he was a very successful businessman, and everybody liked him. I\ndon't know why he took all those people into that house, which was really too much. Made it\nvery difficult, because to be even with two in one room hiding 1s a great stress. To be with\nthe same person with your husband or with your wife for two years in one room is great\nstress and many marriages broke up afterwards. Uh, the 300 women were in another barrack\nand the next morning we were brought to the original Auschwitz camp which we hadn't\nseen, and we got some food for the day and we were in another cattle train. That was the\n28th of October. My daughter was 7 years old that day. It was a gorgeous day. The leaves\nthey were all changing. We were going west, what I thought was just the most wonderful\nthing. Could only be good, and, uh, the doors were kept open while we were going and we\ncame to Czechoslovakia. They didn't tell us 1t was Czechoslovakia. It was high up in\nmountains...was nice, and, uh, it was a good feeling to be away from those killing places and\nfrom the chimney. It felt good. The commandant of this camp...the place was Kratzau.\nKratzau was a factory...had a factory which originally came from Berlin. Hard, hard to find\nout those things because nobody told you really. A Berlin factory probably...was probably all\ndestroyed. They came and took over this factory, which was originally a linen or something.\nSo they made...they had all electric benches, and we got boxes of little cylinders, maybe\nthree or four inches long, and maybe an inch hollow, light material, and we had to put the\nknife of the machine inside the opening. That means we did not do it, but the foreman did it.\nThe foreman turned on the machine and we changed constantly when that shaved inside\nmade the opening a little bigger. That was a factory. She said we have a very good factory\nhere and she addressed us as girls, \"Hi, girls.\"",
        "A: The commandant.",
        "A: The commandant with a white sweater and a turtle neck. She looked cute. She was about 22\nyears old, and uh she called us girls and she said, \"You will have a good life here. You work\nhard, we treat you well.\" It's in the factory where you are living, not in the same factory, but\nabout 15 minutes to walk, and we clean it all up and we are 300 women in each room. So\n1200...we were the last 300....1200 women. Sounded very nice. And, uh, but we changed\ncommandant. It was always a change. Always another woman came. All women. Our\ncaretakers were four soldiers and four women, SS women, young, who were very unhappy\nthat they were in this kind of a village where there was nothing. There was absolutely\nnothing to do, and the winter was very harsh, very cold, lots of snow and ice, and uh the\nplaces where they were sleeping were very primitive. Not much more than we had. They had\nthe same bunks, and, uh, the same toilet. Uh, we were not allowed to use that toilet, but we\ndid anyway. Outside, between the stairs, like in old European places, there was a toilet in\nbetween the stairs, the in between the first and second floor in a corner. That was like that.\nThat was their toilet. I don't know if they had a bathroom. But they built a shower, a large\nshower when we came there. They started to build it. We were never allowed to use it.\nNever. And, uh, we had no water. We had uh a little sink in the hallway which dribbled. We\nhad no water. We could never wash ourselves, and after a very short time we were full of\nlice. Then they...they deloused us, which took a whole day to get deloused. They deloused us\nin Auschwitz already, and the lice came back after a few hours. And they had big drums\nwhere they put our clothes in and we got hot water to wash ourselves in Auschwitz. Didn't\nkill the uh (pause) didn't kill the...we, uh. ..the factory was working 12 hours from 6 to 6, and\nwe could choose, have a choice of day or night shift, and I selected night shift because they\nsaid we would get on Sunday an extra portion of food. That was very important. Food is still\nimportant to me. So it was very important to take the night shift. So the day shift went, and\nwhen the day shift came home, the other ones were already on their way there, but, um as I\nsaid, the winter was bad. We had no heat in our rooms. We lost all our blankets. A lot of\nwomen made underwear from the blankets which when we found that out, we were just\nbesides ourselves, because there were no blankets anymore. And, uh, the International Red\nCross came. A great surprise. Somebody...you know...there are a lot of rumors in those\nplaces. Somebody said they...a cattle car came with boxes in there, and came from\nSwitzerland and we thought that's ridiculous. But a few days later, we got each a handful of\nsugar. Since we had nothing where we could carry it in, everybody got a handful of sugar,\nand you had to lick it right away because there was no other way and our hands were so\nfilthy. We were smelling so much because a foreman in the factory didn't want to come close\nto us, we were smelling so badly, and they didn't want those lice. They can jump. (laugh)\nAnd, uh, we got there in the morning and we came home. We got bread. Sometimes with\nsomething on them. The portions got smaller, cause Germany didn't have much food\nthemselves. And, uh, in the evening we got the so-called dinner which was soup, mostly\nsoup where potatoes or rutabaga was cooked in, but the potatoes and the rutabaga were out,\nand that was all. Or, potatoes in the pan cooked we got sometime three or four potatoes as\ndinner. Christmas we had a very fancy dinner because they had slaughtered a horse and that\ntasted very good. And potatoes. Cooked. That was...but we were already on our way down\nphysically, but when the International Red Cross came actually into the camp...there were\nfour women coming in green uniforms, and we were standing in our five lines, and I heard\nthe commandant in German tell them, \"You just saw our beautiful shower installations. Look\nat those filthy Jews. They do not want to wash themselves. Those pigs.\" And, uh, none of\nthose women asked the question why we didn't want to wash. There was no...1f if they would\nhave washed...or asked, I would have said whatever would have happened. But it was not\npossible. They had brought also sardines, and we got two women one can of sardines. Most\nof us got sick- we didn't have any fat for so long. They must have maybe brought also more\npotatoes or something because...and, oh, ja, green peas...because we had that on Christmas.\nNo soap. (laughs) Nothing like it.",
        "A: No. In the factory, there was a toilet and they had a little sink this size and there was water.\nYou couldn't wash yourself. Maybe you could drink little bit, but the half hour in between\nthe...you know, to, uh, the hours, the twelve hours, was a half an hour time, but we had\nnothing to eat. We had eaten our bread. We had no pockets to put it in. So, uh, you\ncouldn't...you couldn't leave it on your bed or so, because it would be stolen in one minute.\nSo we ate it.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Things never changed. Things got just bad uh when the war got bad. You see, I was always,\nwhen we marched to the factory, always 1n the last row because there were two soldiers with\nus and they spoke German. I could hear what they were saying to each other. And it was just\nuh music in my ears, because they said they were terribly upset. They hadn't heard for weeks\nfrom their families, and they said that Germany is bombed and then all of a sudden I heard\nthat the Allies are in Nuremberg. And I thought, \"In Nuremberg...in the middle of the\ncountry.\" And I told my friends and I said, \"Oh, that cannot take long at all anymore. That\nmust be over soon. They are already in Nurenberg.\" But we were the ones who really\nsuffered so much because it was so cold and we had so little strength left. We buried our\nwomen that died. We didn't know the names. We maybe knew sometimes of their first name.\nWe got very much in going into shells. We...we had no strength anymore to discuss, to talk,\nwhich we did in the beginning. We were playing word games, the ones who knew some and\ncould do it, but that was over. You, you couldn't do that anymore. And, uh, then there must\nhave gotten notice that if..1f. . . the Russians would be coming to us, if they come, then would\nshould be physically in the most perfect condition so they took us on a train to the next town\nwhere there was a prisoner camp- prisoner of war camp. We didn't know. They were French\nsoldiers, and they were so upset when they saw us the way we looked, and they went with us\ninto the uh sauna and they brought the hot water to us and they helped us. But that's all they-\nthey could do. They wished they would have food, because we...we were full of edemas and\nwe were in bad shape, and that took two days, this transport...all those people to that town,\ninto, into this camp and getting home again. And, uh, I was sick. I was sick before that. I got,\nuh, you know...with the...where you get eye- the eye white..get the white of the eye get\nyellow...",
        "A: Uh, Ja, it's not jaundice, it was....",
        "A: Yes, ja, I got contagious hepatitis. I was terribly sick, and so that week because I couldn't eat.\nI couldn't eat, I only wanted to drink. And we had a so-called hospital in there and uh there\nwas one Polish doctor. She was...she was Jewish. Uh, she was a lung specialist. And she had\nnothing to work with. Absolutely nothing. The only thing she had was hot water, and maybe\nsome pain killer. I had no pain. I was just very, very weak. And uh, I guess she said I had\nmore temperature than I really had. Otherwise, I would have to be out. I'm sure because I\ncould hardly walk. I uh, also had an inflamed thumb. And that was throbbing and that\nwas...got red up here and I had no water. I had nothing to...but in the factory where I was\nworking on that machine, there was a file with a point and with that file I opened...filth. I\nopened it. The pus came out. Nothing happened. (laughs) Nothing happened. I had scarlet\nfever and nothing happened. I... That scarlet fever was still in Auschwitz because I brought it\nwith me from the camp in uh Holland. There was an epidemic of scarlet fever. But uh I lived\nthrough all that and, uh, after we were cleaned. After we so-called cleaned, uh the rooms\nwere very cold because they opened them. I don't know where they had the idea when the\nopened the window everything is clean you know. We had no mattresses anymore, we had\njust the plain wood. We did have some...the blankets were gone. The mattresses disappeared,\nand, uh, I have one uh experience which upset me afterwards very much. What I did. One\ntime I...when we came...when I came home from work, I found a mattress in a bed nobody\nwas in and took the mattress and covered myself and then when the others came, somebody\nwas pulling on the mattress...wanted this mattress. So we were sleeping on, on loose boards,\nyou know the...and I took one of...I got. . .[ jumped out of bed. I took the board and lifting it\nup over her head, I thought I wanted to kill her. Taking my mattress. I mean that was just the\nmost important thing. This protected me from this horrible cold. And that I really wanted to\nkill somebody. She dropped the mattress. She got (laugh) got scared. And I really probably\nwould have. I don't know. Uh, in...also, there's another experience in this...1n uh Kratzau.\nThat's what I had started, and I thought it was in Auschwitz uh the factory had no material\nanymore, but the...those women from the SS had to do something, so they made us bringing\ncoal from one corner to the other in the court, in those...you call those things with two\nwheels.",
        "A: The cart, ja. So we always marched by...with a full one and there with an empty one. One\ntime I when I came by I thought, \"She's a nice looking young woman.\" She speaks German. I\nsaid uh, \"I'm glad that I learn a job for after the war.\" So she looked at me and she stopped\nand I stopped. She said, \"What do you mean.\" I said, \"I can always go as a mover.\" She said,\n\"That's a wonderful idea.\" So then I went on and I came back. She was surprised that I spoke\nfluently German. She said uh, \"You come from Germany?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" She said uh,\n\"Why are you here?\" I said, \"What a question.\" \"What did you do that you are here?\" I said,\n\"I didn't do anything. I'm Jewish.\" \"No,\" she said, \"You are all criminals. You all have done\nsomething. Look what you look like. The kind of clothes you are wearing.\" I said, \"You\nreally think those are our clothes?\" She got, uh, a little...she said was a little funny because I\nspoke very good German, not like one who maybe was a criminal in any shape or form.\nThere was another woman going by. I said, \"Look at that woman with her cart. She has a\nPh.D. Her father had one of the largest wine cellars in Amsterdam.\" She said, \"You are,\nyou're out of your mind.\" So I went on. When I came back, then she looked me over again,\nshe didn't talk to me anymore. I asked her what she was doing. I know. I said, \"What are you\ndoing or what did you do?\" She said, \"I was a teacher in Hamburg.\" She...they were told that\nwe were criminals. I said, \"Our clothes were all taken from us. Those are clothes from other\npeople, what you see, and they were never washed.\" Yet was a very interesting (laugh)\nconversation. I hope that it sticks in her mind. (laugh) That's all I can say to that. When we\ncame closer to the end of the war, I think that's what you want to know. The, uh, ...and we\nwere so-called clean, ready for the Russians...we were all very sick...because of the food and\nof diarrhea and the whole place was messy...24 hours. And, uh, we were one time again\ntaken to another place where we were examined by a group of doctors and, uh, the German\ndoctors, they talked German to each other. And so, they uh...when they saw...when I was...it\nwas my turn, so they, uh, tried the nipple . . .to press my nipple and I pushed back and so one\nsaid to the other I had such an edema- my stomach was so swollen. He said I could have bet\nthat she's pregnant. And, uh, I I said, \"That would be a medical miracle.\" They pushed each\nother. They couldn't understand that somebody would say that at that...at that moment. But\nuh, that was about all they did. They saw the edemas. But, uh, we were walking still on our\nlegs. But then one morning when we came out into the cold, the Germans were gone. The\nwar was over. It was May 9th- that's very late. And, uh, the gates were open, and I marched\nout of the gate. I wanted to see it. I saw the lilies of the valley right in front, and I went into\ntown. The town we had walked through every day and I always admired the butcher shop\nbecause he had a lot of sausages hanging there. And, uh, one day there was as I saw on the\nstreet, a little dog, such a round dog, and I said to the girl, \"Wouldn't that be good roasted?\"\n(laugh) And later, many later years when I told that to my husband, he couldn't believe that,\nthat somebody would eat a roasted dog. I said, \"Sure, I would have eaten anything.\" He\ncould never understand that. So I saw the butcher shop when the war was over, and I went\nin. And I said if he would have some sausage for me. He said, \"No.\" And I walked the street,\nand there was a Russian standing there, a soldier. He had a piece of black bread 1n one hand\nand a chicken leg in the other, and I walked up to him and I don't know Russian. I pointed to\nmy stomach and to my mouth, and he give me both. Made me so sick. (laugh) It was much\ntoo rich. But that was the first day, and the third day I decided I was going home. I did not\nwant to wait for what the uh, the owner...not . . the man in charge of the factory, what he\nsaid to us, we should wait until the American or the International Red Cross would come and\npick us all up, bring us to the countries where we belonged. I didn't believe it. I wanted to go\nhome.",
        "A: Was not owner. It was...must have been a, as I said before, a trustee.",
        "A: The owner of the factory, I don't know. There were Germans who worked there, and they\nmust have left uh when the Russians came so close and came there. And, uh, the, uh, the\nRussians came on the second day with the soup kitchen. And it was filthy, and the place was\nnot clean because I left on the 12th and I didn't want to stay there and wait. I just had to go.\nDid not know where Kratzau was. I only know [ had to go west. That's all I knew. And a 16\nyear old girl who was with the group from Amsterdam, she wanted to come with me. And I\ndidn't want her. And I said it a few times. I said, \"I don't want to take the responsibility. I'm\ngoing to places where I don't know myself.\" And, uh, \"Oh,\" she said, \"I want to go home. I\nwant to find my mother. And you speak German. You can do it.\" So, she went with me, and\nuh come to the next station walking...train station, and there were not no trains anymore at\nall. So she said, \"What are we going to do now?\" And uh, I said, \"I really don't know what\nwe are going to do now. I suggest we go to the next town. Sit in the center of the town. They\nalways have something green there. And the way we look women will come. They are\ncurious. They will ask us who we are?\" So the women came! And they said, uh, they could\ndo something for us. They spoke German--in Sudaten. And uh, I said we would like to get\nhot water to wash ourselves. We would like to get a bed, and we also would like something\nto eat. She said you can have all that to eat. She said, \"A chicken died today.\" If you want\nme, I'll prepare it for you. I said, \"Why not? I have always have eaten dead chickens.\"\n(laughter) They were never alive. I was so happy with that chicken. She boiled it and it was\nvery good and we could clean ourselves. And uh, the next day we went on and found another\ntown where they told us that probably that day a train would come, probably. And a train did\ncome and we just went on. There was nobody to talk to and, uh, during the night the train\nstopped and the Russians came on to the train. They had flashlights and they looked...had the\nflashlights on us and then they touched our...touched us here [points to stomach] and then\nthey wanted to go and then I said again my stomach that we are hungry. So they gave us\nsardines. (laughs) Sardines. So II said, they would have to open it. We had nothing. And\nthey did. I found out not too much later that they were looking for Germans to take them\nback and then feeling here and the rest they felt we were women, because you, you know,\nthe way we looked and the hair and all that, they didn't know what it was. But, uh, that's how\nthey found out we were women and left us alone and gave us the sardines. So uh we took a\nlot of trains. We took one train that was...uh a train with all beds. German train with all beds,\nwhite, clean...was wonderful...just wonderful. There was no food there, but there was a good\nbed. And when the train stopped and we went into town, we begged. I begged for bread. I\nonly wanted bread. Because I was used to that bread takes away the hunger. Bread and water\nwas fine. In some place, they had nothing. They give us an umbrella. (laugh) That was\nthe...the, the . .. uh, the mayor's office we went in...we didn't know, and they gave us an\numbrella. And I said, \"Thank you.\" And they had no food. So I took the umbrella and I put it\nthrow away. Was dumb, probably I could have changed it for some bread. I don't know.",
        "A: Home? Six and one half weeks. But, uh, we came to the first American DP camp built. It\nwas just finished in Plzen.",
        "A: In Plzen, we were told that the DP camp was being built, that we should look for it. And we\nfound it. And there were about 400 people there already all lying in the big gymnasium,\nsomething like it, on the floor. Men and women who had been uh workers, who had been\npicked up in different countries, and everybody wanted to go a different place. They were\nthere and had blankets and we were all lying on the floor. There were no Jews. We were the\nonly Jews. And that was a strange thing. We couldn't...I couldn't understand that. So then we\nwere a little bit examined, and we became uh double rations and that started anti-Semitism 1n\nthose four or five hundred people. That the Jews here, look what they give those women.\nWas difficult, very difficult, until then the Americans had trucks, open trucks and brought us\nfarther west because that's where we wanted to go. Also, there was a lists going from this\nplace all over the world who was there surviving, and that came to Chicago and they found\nout to Chicago... sorry...to Amsterdam to find out that I was alive, but they didn't know\nwhere. They only knew the name was there. That was all those lists were...Chicago. (laughs)\nAnd, uh, we were in an open truck to Leipzig where there was a very large DP camp, about\n25,000, and there were maybe 25 Jews. That was all. Uh, there I went to...I asked I wanted to\ngo to a gynecologist. I wanted to find out if they would do something to me that I was\nnot...uh, had not, all that time, uh, no ...what's the word?",
        "A: That's right. Ja. So, uh, and this was a German gynecologist, and he looked at me and I\nlooked a little funny. By that time I was clean. By that time I had no lice anymore because\nthere was a medical tent in this camp and I walked in with my little friend and I said, \"Listen,\nwe have so much lice. Can you help us? The Germans have tried to delouse us so many\ntimes, they never could.\" \"That's nothing,\" they said. We wanted to take our dress off and\nthey said, \"Don't do that.\" They had a large spray machine which was used to discharge\nwhite powder under the arms and under the skirt, and two hours later all those lice were dead\nand I thought the Americans they really know it. They had DDT and they didn't know at that\ntime, they had killed more than lice. So I went to this doctor, because I was clean and he\nlooked at me and he looked at all the edemas, and he said uh, \"Where were you? Where do\nyou come from?\" I said, \"I was in uh extermination camp.\" He called his nurse in..and he\nsaid, \"Listen what that woman says. Look what she looks like. 70 pounds and swollen.\" He\nsaid, \"Tell me.\" So he and she, they listened. He did not know those details. He had no idea.\nHe surely knew that the Jews had been gone, but he did not know what they had done to\nthem. That was in the city of Leipzig.",
        "A: Ja. That is.. Ja. The, uh...when I came to the border. We came to the border with an\nAmerican train. Took six days because we had to built pontoon bridges. The American\nsoldiers did not give us anything to eat or to drink. They didn't understand what I meant\nwhen I said that we had nothing to eat. They didn't understand. Six days. We were very sick.\nWe came to the border. We had to walk over the border because the train only stopped there\nand we got into an office. We only could get on the train if you said you were uh, a Dutch\ncitizen, which I said and I was not, and uh, the bureaucracy came and I, as a good German,\nsaid right away, \"I am not a Dutch citizen. I am stateless.\" And the man had never heard\nwhat stateless 1s, but that young girl with me who was very happy to be home said, \"Be\ncareful with that woman. She is a German, and she is an enemy of our country.\" She\nconfused that man completely and he put me in jail. And, uh, I've never seen her again. I\ndidn't want to see her. She was in Holland. She was saved. We were together for six and a\nhalf weeks. I was a mother and she was a child, in a way. And that's what happened. Though\nuh, two days later the Rabbi of Eindoven that was the town where it happened, got me out of\njail. I don't know...I forgot his name, but he found out. I don't know how, and I got with\nanother lie and big screaming, uh,...permission to go to Amsterdam because there were no\ntrains...there was no...and I wanted to go to Amsterdam. So I came there, and I found the\npeople who had helped us and, uh, they told me that my daughter was fine, which was the\nmost important thing.",
        "A: I didn't find my husband. He never came back.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: Ja. I don't know what happened. I don't know. I saw him the last time before I was going in\nto this place where the women were in the black dresses. I never have seen him again and\nthere is no...there is no record for the dead. There's a record of the trains...the numbers of the\ntrains and how many people were in the trains, all the trains deporting the Jews, you know\nthat? So I have it. And, uh, all the trains I have been in are there, but they have no record of\nwho died. Uh, they told me that Doris was fine and the next day one of the friends had a jeep\nbecause there was nothing else and he brought me to that town where she was. They had told\nher already that I had been sick and that I was better and I would come, but nobody knew\nwhen. In that little village where she was, all the girls who had had relationships with\nGerman soldiers, when the war was over were brought into the center of the city and their\nheads were shaved. And she thought it was so funny. Kids, you know, you know, they didn't\nunderstand. And so here I was with a shaved head and she looked at me and she said, \"Are\nyou my mother?\" I said, \"Yes, I'm your mother.\" I didn't come close to her. I didn't touch her.\nAnd she was eating lunch because afternoon school starts she said, \"I would like to go to\nschool that...she said to our friend, Rinus, she said, \"Rinus, If you could bring me with your\njeep to the school, I would like the kids to see the jeep. So that's what they did. Not me. And,\nuh, I did something very wrong. I asked the lady where she was if I could take her with me\nthat day. Leave everything there. Anyway probably thinking I bring her back, but I didn't. I\ntook her with me. And we had nothing. We had no bed. Nothing. I uh, felt I needed her. I\nneeded her very much. We need our children more than they need us. That's something I\nhave learned. I needed her and I did it. So uh, some of the friends gave us a room with one\nbed and we slept there. We, uh...we made it. We got rooms and we could rent because there\nwas no place and, uh, since my husband didn't come back. A year and a half later we went to\nthe United States where my parents were. And she was very happy to have grandparents, to\nhave uh, cousins, uncles...we didn't have.",
        "A: It must have taken her a long time. I don't think that I was aware of what I had done to take\nher out of this secure home in this life with a woman who wasn't completely normal. I'm\nconvinced. I was the only one who didn't know. But I'm convinced. And she, uh...I was only\nlooking for a place for us to live that we were just like a family and that she would...she\nwould be home and I'm the mother. But we never discussed it, practically all our lives. Uh, it\nwas sometimes when she was maybe...that time when I picked her up she was seven-and-a-\nhalf. Maybe when she was...when she was still in Amsterdam, one day she did something\nwhich I said she shouldn't. She said, \"I wish you wouldn't have come.\" And that was the only\ntime as a child.",
        "A: You're welcome.",
        "A: But my daughter had learned. Ja, and we never discussed it.",
        "A: We never discussed it. Uh, there is a book out about LNever Said Goodbye.",
        "A: You know it?",
        "A: And I...when it came out, there was a write up in the paper, and she happened to be visiting\nfrom Israel, and I said, \"That's a very interesting book. I would like to read it.\" And she\nlooked at it. I said, I'm only very much upset that all those people who say they were\nabandoned, say that still after they have children themselves. Don't they want to protect their\nchildren?\" \"No,\" she said, \"I can understand.\" I wasn't abandoned. It was the first time, and,\nuh, \"I said I will never learn that, never and never accept it.\" She uh, went to New York then,\nand then she found the book and she send it to me and she put in there, \"Thank you for\ngiving me life twice.\" It wasn't necessary to discuss it. Really. It would have made our\nrelationship painful if we would have discussed it. If I would have constantly heard that I see\nit from the wrong way then I never could. So that...um that she has understood after all those\nyears. We have a very good relationship now.",
        "A: When I picked her up she was seven-and-a-half. Oh, I talked about the camp to anybody.",
        "A: Ja, but it was . . .it didn't really sink in that . . .No, no really not at that time- much later. And\nwhen I started to study all the books, much later, when I started to speak, she, in some way I\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n"
