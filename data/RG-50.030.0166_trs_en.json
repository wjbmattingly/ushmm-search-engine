        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Lonia Mosak.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Ciechanow, Poland.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: In July 20, 1922.",
        "Q: Tell me about your parents and your family?",
        "A: Well, my husband...my father was a sign-maker. I managed to finish school before the\nwar, 1926. Yes. Then I went to learn a profession.",
        "Q: Let's see. Before you jump to 1933, your father was a signmaker. Tell me, did you have\nbrothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. I have...I have three brothers. One died before the war and one was taken in\nAuschwitz in a selection, and one went to Russia, the oldest one, but he came back after the war\nand got married in Chicago. I brought him here, and he got killed in a car accident. Yal. He left a\nwife and three children.",
        "Q: What about your school then. Tell me about the school you went to.",
        "A: Well, we...we had a separate school for Jewish kids, you know, was separate. They let\nthem...",
        "Q: Excuse me. This makes noise.",
        "A: We finished school and I belonged to a Zionist movement. When I was 12 years old, we\nstarted. And we used to go to seminars with other kids from other cities. It was well organized in\nthe future what you saw it was working like you know through the city. It was a poor life in\nPoland, but we were happy. We didn't know any other way how to live, so that was it,\u201d you\nknow. Then when the war broke out in 1939, when the Germans came in the first thing what they\ndid, they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and put into the synagogue and they had to take out\nall the, you know, and everything the...and everything and put on the sidewalk and burn them\u2019.\nOnly Jewish people have to do this. Then they started to grab people to work every single day.\nEvery Jew who walked by a building where there was a German officer, he had to kneel down\nand take off their hats when they passed by; otherwise, they would be shot, you know. Then\nwhen they came out to talk to the people, they said, \"Good morning, brother \u201d .\" He says, \"Good\nmorning, swine.\" You know what swine is? Pigs. Okay. Then they started to grab people to\nwork. All the time. Then they start to confiscate all the business what the people had. So there\nwas a lot of \u2019Holsterges living in our city, so they knew exactly the addresses and the names of\nthe people who had business. So they went in and they confiscate everything. Then while we\nwere sleeping, started to rip off the roofs from the building,...the roofs because they thought\nthey're going to make a garden in the middle of the city so the Jewish people shouldn't live there.\nSo everybody start to run to different places. They lived like 10...10 people in one small room.\nThen I got sick from typhus. Jewish people was not allowed to use a doctor or a drugstore or a\nhospital. So they...me and may womans...in the outskirts of the city in a little room.\u201d and they\nsent in a doctor, a Jewish doctor. I think he came from Germany. He had one artificial leg. There\nwas no medication and everybody was dying every day and I expect to die too, but it was a\nmiracle. After 8 weeks laying there, I kind of recovered. There was no medication or nothing.\nThey cut off the hair and everything. Then they started to take hostages...people. They want so\nmuch money. Ten and a half figures, two and a half figures. People gave away everything. They\ngot the rings, their watches, even the gold you put in your mouth, just to take all those people.\nThen...",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: No. They released them. They released them. Then they organized like a Judenrat. They\nhave a release from all the people, start to make a gold star. We have to wear one on the left side\nand one on the right side, so when you walk on the street you know that you're a Jew. I went out\nfrom that thing when I recovered.\u201d There was no food. Nothing to eat. People just starving,\nfamilies. I lived in an attic. It was terrible condition, so we start to ask the Russian...German,\n\"Why don't you kill us?\" They says, \"No, we need those guns on the front. You'll die anyway.\"\nSo after a couple of months, they decided they're not going to make a ghetto. The city's too\npretty. They going to make fine building. \"It's so close \u2019through Germany. They're going to take\nhalf of them from Mlawa and half of them to \u2019Newstadt, the ghetto. We have to go out the\nmiddle of the night, all of us to...to go to a little bridge where the water was to go into that castle.\nYou know babies was crying. Somebody picked up a baby, but it's shot right away. Then inside\nwe had to go out to another...nother door. On both sides were standing the German, the black\nuniform and \u2019\u2019throwing down the rifles and beat over the head. Everybody went down. The blood\nwas running like water. Finally, we had to run the truck. They took the doctor, threw him down\non the ground, and the Gestapo stepped on his face with the feet and hand. He committed suicide\nin Auschwitz. \u201d . But then they took us to Newstadt. We came into Newstadt. There was a ghetto\nalready. In the...and we watched 20 minutes, they had to beat up a Jew. There was no place\nwhere to go in. People was running like crazy. They cut off the hair from the woman. I ran into a\nstable. That where we lived there for a couple of weeks and we organized...we made a kitchen\nwith a little bit soup to give the people. And whole families die over night.",
        "Q: Tell us...tell us...slow down just a little. Tell us what it was like in the stable.",
        "A: That unreal. First of all, no water, no food or nothing. People was dying and we was\njealous they're already dead. Finally, I found out that they hanged my uncles in the other city. I\nfound out. I didn't want to tell my aunt. So she saw me, she said what are you crying. I said,\n\"No.\" \"Did you hear something?\" I said, \"No. I didn't hear.\" I didn't want to tell her. She didn't\nknow til the last minute. Then they decided they're going to take us to Auschwitz. We didn't\nknow where we're going. They took us in those cattle trains, locked in, for 3 days and 3 nights.\nWomen are giving the babies urine to drink. It was bad. Half of them die anyway. And they took\nus ride for 3 days like that. We came out and everything got to be fast...fast. We came into\nAuschwitz. We didn't know what's going. It was in the middle of the night. THey always did it in\nthe middle of the night. They...right away, they cut off like let's say a 100 women, men, 200, a\n100 men. You could be young. You didn't have a chance. They just cut off a group. That many\nthey let into the camp. Right away, we don't see our people...anything...our parents. In a second,\nyou didn't see it. They divided. Right. Left. Right. Left. Dr. Mengele. Once they had a little\ngroup for the camps, the rest went to the crematorium. Let's say there was like 3,000 people in\nthat train. They took out 200 or 300 for the camp. Then we realized...they took us into a room\nand they told...we had to take off the clothes, everything. Cut our hair all over, and then they\ngave us those clothes. They didn't even fit. Gave us those clothes, and they took us into a\nbarrack. The barrack was...had to hold thousand people, not less. So there was their \u2019couriers.\nHow do you call it...where we in three lines. Nothing there, no\u201d blankets or nothing. Some of\nthem slept on the...on the bricks. Then about 4:00 in the morning, we had to get up and stand\nnaked even in the winter to see if we have a clear skin. There they count us in 5, a hundred in a\ngroup, and the SS with the dogs took us to work. We had to walk, let's say, maybe 10 miles a day\nto work. Many of them died on the way walking so they give us a stick to put us there dead\npeople. Two have to hold them this way. One have to hold their feet to take them to the place\nwhere we supposed to work. Then we have to bring them back because the appell. They have to\ncount the people that everybody's there. So we have to bring those dead people back, so they put\nthem like on a piece of wood two hold here and the rest of them hold here, to bring those dead\npeople because everybody gotta be counted. Then when we looked around we saw people are\nstanding in the line to get into the crematorium. No food. No bathrooms. No nothing. They want\nto get all already we be dead\u201d. The crematoriums was going for 24 hours. Day and night. Before\nyou saw \u201d\u201d\u2019 They bring transports from all over Europe, from France, from Belgium, from\nHolland, from Poland, from every country in Europe. They didn't miss one country. I think\nmaybe Norwegian they missed. The conditions in the camp was horrible. We didn't see...for 7, 8\nmonths there was no water in Auschwitz, completely. They just...just put electric wires around\nfor barracks. There was nothing else there. No water. After 7, 8 months, there's no water there.\nWe have to walk to work every day. Hungry. The lice on the whole body, all over our faces. \u201d It\nwas snowing. Beaten up. One time an SS man beat me up with the rifle. He thought I'm dead\nalready. I starts to work. Beat us up. \u201d You know just for fun. Pulled out a few people, beat us\nup. Then they gave us a piece of bread, but we didn't know, should we take a crumb every hour\nor should we swallow it right away. We couldn't figure out what to do with this. When we ate it\nup, we was sorry why we ate it up already. This way we have another crumb to eat. We was\ngoing to work...was beaten up, after work all the time, kicked us up, beat us up. \u201d That what we\nhave to do. Slapped us. Iron wagons with the bricks. You know, it wasn't actually work, but on\ntop of it just to make people work. Just to make people work. Then on Sunday, when we came\nback from work Sunday, the day off, we had to put our clothes, button up in the back and put in a\nlot of sand so one place we \u2019\u2019slept to another one. So people who couldn't run fast, the dogs went\nafter them. Always beaten up, you know. It was a helluva condition. I can't believe...I was 18\nyears old that that. I... can't visualize how people can even go through that without food, without\nwater, with everything. That was going on for 2 and a half years in...in the camp. Then when\nthey saw the Russian...the Russian are coming, they took us from Birkenau to Auschwitz. There\nwas already better buildings and a better thing. In Birkenau, I forgot to mention, that...there was\nan uprising in Birkenau. They killed a lot of Germans. They put them in the oven, but in 5\nminutes the whole sky was with so many German airplanes that you couldn't see the skies\nanymore. And everybody who was moving was killed anyway. People start to run. They wants to\nfind out how those people was organized because nobody can have a pencil or a piece of paper.\nOne of mine counselor, like a blockaltester, was 5 girls, 5 sisters from Czechoslovakia. She kind\nof tried to put on paper what's happened and she hid it in her coat and they find it. So they said\nthey're going to shot her. So the other four sisters stood by and they said, \"We want to be shot\ntoo.\" So they shot all five sisters. Then when they start to figure out how the uprising...there was\na girl...I think was her name. I forgot.\u201d I think. \u201d And she was organized this thing. So they\nwants to take her to hang her, so she cut her veins. And she slapped the SS man. He says,\n\"You're dying.\" She says, \"I die today, but you gonna die tomorrow.\" Even make a film from\nthat. Then one girl dropped...girls who brought in the evening ammunition what they smuggled\nout\u201d ammunition. One girl broke down. They beat her up and she says, \"If you tell us, what's\nhappening, you're gonna be \u2019\u2019sleep. We're not going to torture you.\" But that wasn't the...the fact.\nShe knew three other girls. That's all she knew. And one of the girls was \u201d my girlfriend. They\nbeat her up. She didn't tell anything because they would hang a lot of people if she would tell to\nwho she gave and how the things happened. The girl who gave up was the first to be hanged. The\nGerman punished her. And everybody have to stay and watch when they hang those four girls. It\nwas like in...in January. In January 18, we have to leave the camp. They announced the\nmicrophone, we...I and five girls wants to hide it between the floor. So they announced on the\nmicrophone if they catch anybody, they will be shot on the spot. So I says to the girls, \"Maybe\nit's no use to do it. It looks like the world's coming to an end to the German army. Let's go.\" So\nwe starts to walk. We couldn't walk. We have to run out from the camp. And in five in groups.\nAnd who couldn't run was shot. Right away on the spot. Some people begged, \"I want to just\ncatch my breath.\" No. If you couldn't run, you know, people haven't good shoes and all these\nthings, so they shot. And we was jealous. They are already dead, and they don't have to go\nthrough all this. Finally, they took us on a truck\u201d to get deeper to Germany. We was without\ncovers and the snow was coming on us. No boots. And then about thousand woman was walking.\nThey threw one bread. You know how many people got killed just to...I never runned for that. I\nknew. The first one got crushed already. One bread for thousand people. Such a sadistic way.\nThen they took us into Ravensbruck. In Ravensbruck, the hunger was unbelievable, terrible.\nAlready, they gonna take us to Gross Rosen, and they didn't let us in. They got a little too many\npeople, so they took us to Ravensbruck. In Ravensbruck, we was there a couple weeks and saw\nthe Russians were behind, coming, they took to from Mettlenberg, Newstadt \u201d in the camp. A\nroom like that was a few hundred women. If you lay down to sleep, you couldn't turn around.\nThere was no room. That's how you had to lay all night. This was the...we was there in that\ncamp. It was terrible. The hunger...they gave us a little piece of bread for 24 hours. It was\nunbelievable how people was dying. The end was near that camp was people...pilots...which they\nwas shot down American planes, and Canadians so the Germans locked the gate and they ran\naway. It was in...",
        "Q: I don't understand. Explain.",
        "A: When the war come to a...to a finished, the German run away from that camp, from us,\nand they locked the gate. And we didn't know that the war was to end. So those people, those\npilots cut the wires...you know was divided, and told us that the war is over. The Germans went\naway. So we starts to run to the...out to get some food, you know. All the Germans from this city\nleft the houses. They knew that we come out they're gonna be killed. They knew that what was\ngoing down. So everybody left those houses...that we went into those houses, and we took food.\nWe got food for here, but we were... But I even now we was tired walking, so the same day came\nin the...the American soldiers and the Russians the same day, to Mettlenberg. And they was\nkissing each other. Thank God that the war is over, because 1n some places the Germans was still\nfighting. So there was a guy...a German guy with a wagon with horses. So we told him to give us\nthe wagon, the horses. He says, \"No.\" So a Russian officer walked by, took him by the head,\nthrew him in the..in the...in the yard. He said, \"You give them everything they wanted.\" The\nRussians said that like this. They were very nice to us. Real nice. So we took the horses and the\nwagon and we start to go out closer to the city. Then when the night came over, we took out a\nhouse, and we went the house to stay overnight. Part of the way was a lot of soldiers. You know,\nthey let out from Russia, from the jail everything, and there was a rape of a lot of girls. So one\nRussian officer came in, a very intelligent man, and he says, \"Listen, the war is over. There's a\nlot of people came out from the jail. They do bad things. We can't control it. But I'm going to sit\nhere a whole night and watch you.\" We were 10 girls togethers, which was nice. He was sitting.\nWhile he was sitting, they knocked on the door. They saw coming in. So he went to the door.\nThey ran away. They was afraid for him. So he says, \"I can't protect you anymore,\" he says. You\ntake...try to take the trains and go to Berlin because in the city will be more protected. So we\nwent on a train. The trains happened like there was going for an hour and 6 hours there was\nstanding. It was broken off. We went in the train. We was together 10 girls. And Russian soldiers\ncame in and they took I imagine they saw girls. They says, \"We're going to bring our friends\nhere.\" While he was in the other side, we ran out from the train. The train was standing. And\nthere was a lot of broken trains. So we decided every girl would go, lay down under a train. In\nthe morning, we will board it. We were laying like that a whole under those broken trains. You\nknow, every girl. In...In the morning, we got up. The train left already with our stuff and\neverything. We didn't care already. So we starts to go from one city to the other til we got into\nBerlin. Well, being in Berlin, we didn't have any families. We didn't have anybody. They wasn't\nwell organized like after the war, so we decided we're going back to Poland. Because we got\nsome property there, we're going back to Poland. So 10 girls came back to Poland. We didn't\nrealize that Poland was worse than with \u2019the Germans. They didn't want any Jew to come there\nbecause then they claim their properties. So they didn't want us. So when you went out on the\nstreet, you saw laying dead Jews, which they came back from Russia or from the army. They\nweren't missed by nobody. They didn't have any family, so nobody knew who they are. Their\nfamilies was killed, and they sneaked out from Russia in 1945. So all the time you saw. So\nfinally, what we gonna do? I came back to my city. With five other girls, went in a house. The\n\u201d\u2019 Army Kiova went in and they killed those girls. One was under the bed. They didn't know that\nshe's alive. She's 9 years old.\u201d . Anyway, they saw a Jew, they killed it. They wasn't missed by\nnobody. So we decided it's not good we...in the city either. So we went to Lodz. I went. A few...a\nfew remained. They got boyfriends right away. I went to Lodz. I came to Lodz. I went into a\nkibbutz. We got a roof over there. There's something to eat. Israel wasn't established in that time.\nI was in Lodz. So one group went to a different city for a...a reunion. They took off 4 boys...I\nshouldn't have bring their picture, I think I got. They took off four boys and a girl and they killed\nthem right away, from the train. It was 18 or 19 year olds. So you could only be in that kibbutz 6\nmonths. We have to smuggle our way to Lodz. I find out that my brother is alive in Russia. I\nwant to wait for him. So I went to Bialystok. > We went into a kibbutz. He was there. Another\nkapo man. Meantime, my brother came. The police came in one night and this...told us there're\ngoing to pogram. They're going to kill us. So every 2 hours, 2 other men were standing. In time,\n5 people went back to Lodz, those of us who want to\u201d want to go.",
        "Q: I don't understand.",
        "A: Five people went to \u2019Valsa from that kibbutz. Yal.\u201d\u2019. In time, one boy saw what's going\nto come. He was hiding by another lady, she had a\u201d . So they didn't see that boy. All the other 12\nwas killed. So he told us in Bialystok\u201d that they was killed. He came into \u201dValsa. It's\nunbelievable. People don't realize how many Jews were killed after the war from the Polish end.\nThe reason I was still in Poland...I didn't go to Israel\u2019\u2019, I was waiting for my brother. I know I had\nonly one...one brother. He was alive. So I was waiting in Bialystok\u201d. Then the Brichah saw that\ntoo many Jews get killed in Poland, and we had to go out. But they came in...People start the\nkilling for Russia because about half a million Jews escaped to Russia when the war started. But\nthey start to come back. Some of them got killed in\u201d . Some of them died. Some of them came\nback....the children. They came back to the Brichah, took us to Czechoslovakia. You have to\nwork to the Polish. You took a train to Czechoslovakia. And over there, their parents was waiting\nfor us.\u201d You couldn't stay too long in Czechoslovakia. We had to go to Austria. We came to\nAustria in the barracks. I didn't have nothing to eat. We had to run in...in to the fields and catch a\ncarrot or potato to eat, because they wasn't prepared for that. So in time, my husband had a\ncouple of brothers in Russia.",
        "Q: Hold it. Slow down a little bit. Where did you met your husband?",
        "A: Yes. Well, I was standing like this...he...my husband was liberated in Austria. He didn't\nwant to leave there. They gave him a hotel and they put a few people for those they were\nhousing. The day he\u201d boat is coming and some brothers in Russia, so he came to see if he'll find\nsomebody. There's only people from Russia . They stood in Germany or in Austria. I said, \"Well,\nthe reason I went back to Poland, I knew I wanted to see if somebody 1s alive from Russia.\" My\nbrother. So I stood there a year in Poland. You couldn't leave Poland. The...the Russian was\nthere. You couldn't leave Poland, when the Russian was there. You couldn't leave Poland.\u201d \u201d\nBut the Brichah somehow got those people out from Poland to Czechoslovakia. And I met my\nhusband and he told me that he had papers to go to the United States. A second cousin signed the\npapers. If I marry, I can be on those papers. So I says, \"I have no choice. Either I wasn't\nestablished. I was sick and tired from...from all this life. I couldn't take it anymore. So I says,\n\"Okay.\" But only if my brother goes with me, but it took the government in Austria to let him in\nbecause you not supposed leave the city.\u201d, only the \u201d . So I got married. Right? After a week, I\ngot married. We stood in Austria and we was waiting to immigrating to America. Here. But my\nbrother couldn't. Only me because I was on the paper. When I came to America, it wasn't like\nnow. They have...because we had a sponsor. That sponsor had to be a very cruel man. He got the\npapers for somebody else. So when we came here, we couldn't have any help from nobody. On\nthe third day, I went to work down town. You know, I got work right away, and my husband\ncouldn't get a job. I got a job. I start to work. I work overtime. I worked all the time, just to make\na little money. I said, \"I don't want to be poor. I can't be without shoes, without clothes.\" And I\nstart to work....",
        "Q: Where did you work at?",
        "A: [...work in a...not factory...making suits, ladies suits and clothes, you know. So I was\nthere, kind of fast piece work. I worked all the time. Then my husband couldn't get a job, so\nsomebody told us to open up a little cleaning store in a PolishOJewish neighborhood. My\nhusband didn't speak English. I speak a little bit. So we opened up that store. After work, I came\nin and worked in the clothing store til 12 o'clock at night to make a few dollars to get an\napartment, you know. So after 2 years like that, then I have my children. And I had an apartment\nand I had a little money in the bank. I had the two children. My daughters are very well educated.\nThey all finished college. And I had...my oldest will have a Masters from Harvard College. They\ntook piano lessons 10 years, went to Hebrew school. All those things. My younger daughter is a\nlab technician. She got a good profession. She got married. Now she is India. (crying) If not, for\nher I wouldn't be alive. Only for her, I'm living. Not for me. (crying) You know, I can't sleep\nbecause all the pictures what we went through doesn't go away. When I sleep with my\ndaughter...you see I live along my husband died 14 years old. When I live along, I don't know\nhow I sleep. When I sleep with my daughter, all coming back to \u201d . Cause I'm screaming,\nsometimes running, screaming and standing by the crematorium. That don't go away.\u201d I'm\nalways screaming because it's very real and I dream about it.\u201d and I don't know what's going on\nyou know. But the only thing, if I would...1f I wouldn't have my daughter because she's so good\nto me, it's unbelievable, I wouldn't be alive. I would finish my life because you have no relatives.\nOn holidays or something, nobody's there. And I thought if I sleep three hours a night that's a lot.\nI can't fall asleep. Never. All the things comes back. I's real like I'm in Auschwitz. \u201d No matter\nhow much you try, you just can't go away all those things. \u201d What else do you want to know?",
        "Q: Let's hold it and stop the tape. What's going on?",
        "Q: Turn the tape back on. Tell me when we rolling again. You okay?",
        "A: Yal. I'm alright now. So if it's not for my brother, I would finish my life. Even though my\nother daughter is well educated, she is not as close to me as that one, you know\u201d. Yal. She's very\ngood. She calls me every day. In the morning when she gets up, before she goes to sleep. They\ngo trips. They always take me with, you know, so she's really my...my life. Without her, I\nwouldn't survive. You know, the older you get, the weaker you get to take all those things you\nknow. The...it...it's harder to take, you know, when you think about all those things. It doesn't go\naway. Never goes away. The picture. All those pictures. When you laying in a stable, you haven't\ngot work to eat, and you jealous the others die and I didn't. All those things doesn't go away.\nNever. I can see some people twill their little foot or something. That is unreal to me. And people\nwas starving like that, but what the Germans did, I\u2019 don't think nobody can even put in words.\nAll those things what happened. It's impossible to describe those things. Just impossible.",
        "Q: Sonia. I would like to take you back again. Okay?",
        "A: Yal.",
        "Q: If we can. You told me...go back, all the way back to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You told me that your uncle was hanged.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "Q: There were several people hanged.",
        "A: Yal. Seven people together",
        "Q: O Alright. Can you go back and tell us very slowly the story of that.",
        "A: Yal. Well, when they took us out from the city to the ghetto, there still was Jewish people\nin the \u2019Channo. They need them for work so my uncle decided he'll go back with...with the\ndaughter, you now. He was hiding in a attic, and for some reason the German find out about it.\nSome of them went a running back. They shot them right on the spot, you know, when they\ncatched them on the way. \u201d . They took my uncle, and they took the men whose house was there,\nand my cousin, a couple from another city, a boy, Lindenberg from my city. And because my\nuncle have a brother, the brother have to be hanged too. Usually when they hanged people, they\nsold tickets that the Germans going to be show. When they hanged my city, I wasn't there when\nthey hanged the five people. Two they hanged because they was hiding there. They throw around\nthe things on the cemetery to find out. So they hanged two people. Then the hanged five other\npeople, and the family...and they warned them if they cried, they'd be shot so they have to stay\nand watch it for 3 hours, from 6 to 9. Mine uncles, because they were prominent people, they\npaid off the Gestapo, they should make execution another city, so the family shouldn't stay and\nwatch that. So they took it to *Mettlenberg, a different city and that happened in \u201d , and they\nhanged those seven people. Mine cousin was fighting back and they shot her. She didn't want to\nwalk up to the hanging. There was seven people. When I find out, I was in the ghetto. Mine...my\naunt didn't know about it. I didn't want to tell her I find out. Then when I was in Auschwitz, I\nthought to myself if I ever survive, that's the only thing what I'm going to do is look for my\nbrother who went to Russia and dig out those people. So I picked myself up and I went to this\ncity, but a couple of Jews are there already. I walked into them and I told them to help me how to\ngo through with that. I know it's not a easy thing.",
        "Q: After the war?",
        "A: After the war. Yal. They helped me. They helped me. They have to have a permit. They\nput them in one casket, all these things, and we got them on the Jewish cemetery. Then, a day\nlater, I walked out to make a march on this little thing. I was arrested by the Polish people. So\nwhat are you doing on the cemetery. I said, \"Well, I have to put a\u201d\u2019 because I'm going to leave\nthis country.\" He says, \"You are a spy.\" I said, \"How am I spy when I have number on my hand.\nI was in Auschwitz for 2 and a half years.\" He said, \"Everybody could make a number.\" So they\narrested me. \"You're on the cemetery. You're a spy.\" So finally, they let me out, you know. They\nfinally let me out. I was glad to leave that country. It's hard to believe it, what the Polish people\ndid to the Jew. It's just unbelievable. If a person went in, he didn't go out alive. When I was in the\nghetto, it was...uh...a Jewish man. He was a\u201d. You know what a\u201d means. So he divided\nbetween son...the son was by one family, and he was by another family.\u201d He had to have in the\nmorning girls. And he paid off those Polish people. After the war, the guy come up...he's 9\nyears...their older son. I saw him when I was in Europe. He came out. He went into the other\nfamily to look for the father, but the father wasn't there. So he took a few Russian people and\nstarted to dig up in the basement and he was buried. They took the money, but they killed him on\ntop of it. So the son\u201d by a different family. He was by a different family. It's unbelievable, you\nknow. It's unbelievable. The Jewish people came back. They have a house. They figured they'd\ngo and take the papers and get back. They walked in the house. They didn't come out alive. I\nhave a close girlfriend now. She was in there from Warsaw, and she was hiding in the woods.\nShe was lost in there. After the war, she came back to the girlfriend what she went to school\ntogether, and she says, \"Could I sleep over by you til I get organized and we go further.\" She\nsays, \"Yes, you can sleep by me.\" While she was in bed, she hear the brother came in and he\nsaid, \"What? You\u201d took in a Jew? I'll kill her. I'll cut off her head.\" So she ran out through the\nwindow. Luckily, she wasn't sleeping. She heard that. So she ran out from the window. What?\nYou gonna save \u2019a Jew? After the war, mind you. That's how it was in Poland. It was a very\ndanger life in Poland. I was there almost a year waiting for my brother came back from Russia.\nOtherwise I wouldn't probably stay that long over there. But it's unbelievable what's happened,\nyou know. People come back. When we came into Czechoslovakia, the Brichah took us out. The\nRussians...they pick them up like a piece of bread, a little milk to get from the kitchen to\neverybody. They are different from people to people. The Czechoslovakian didn't know people\nare coming. They all run up and give away the last piece of bread.\u201d In Poland, \u201d . That's the way\nthe situation was in Poland. It's unbelievable. I was glad to leave Europe. When I went back to\nIsrael, they asked me, Don't you want\u201d \"Don't you want to go to Poland to the \u201d ?\" I says, \"I\ndon't want to look at their faces anymore. I don't want to have nothing to do with these people.\"\nThat's the memories of these people.",

        "A: Yal",
        "Q: Tell us what happened when...why did the girls try to smuggle out gun powder and what\nhappened and what was the reaction?",
        "A: Yal. Well. Well, people decided that we're never going to go out alive from there. There\nwas no question about it. The told us every day, \"If the world finished 12 o'clock, 10 before 12,\nyou be killed.\" That's what they tell us. But when the Russians start to come to Poland and the\nGermans start to lose the war, they start to take apart the crematoriums. They didn't want a see\nanything left. One was left. The...all the other five was done with it, so the people have to take\napart. So we smelled in the air that the war eventually will come to an end, but we not going to\ngo out alive, because that's what they told us. So the people decided they going to make uprising\nthere. The only way...they didn't having nothing, so a lot of girls works in a union. They called\nthe union where they maked ammunition. So the girls smuggled out \u2019after work and they gave it\nto the men to through the wires you know. A lot of men came into Birkenau camps, so they put a\ncontract. They came into work in the camp. So they gave them this ammunition. Took maybe a\nyear to organize that. And they decided that one day they gonna cut the wires, run and kill\nthe...few SS what they were there. Well, it wasn't the case like that because the Polish\nunderground supposed to come to help. They never show up. You see, they never show up, so\nthe 10 kids...soon they start to kill a couple of Germans, they put them in the oven and cut the\nwires, the whole sky was with airplanes, Germans. You didn't see the sky. Just airplanes. And\nthey start to shot down the people start to run. Out you know. And then the start to investigate.\nThey want to know how the whole thing was organized. And they start to beat up those girls who\nwork and that only one girl broke down. She couldn't take it anymore, and she told them...she tell\nthem to leave her alone. So she only knew the three other girls. In between those three was my\ngirlfriend. We went to school together. Well, they beat them up in the office. I have a girl what\nshe was a secretary there and she told them this. Stripped them naked, and they beat them up\nwith that...how do you call it? Uh...",
        "Q: A whip?",
        "A: A whip. Yes. And the whip was between was steel. They whipped them up on the body\nand a doctor was reviving them they should tell. Well, they never told anything anymore. And\nthen decided they're going to hang them. And that's what they did. Like in January. But 2 weeks\nbefore, they took us up on the camps, and we had to run. The Germans...because the Russians\nwere behind, you know. And they hanged those four girls and everybody had to stay and watch it\nwhile they hang those those girls. That was the end.",
        "Q: What happened to the men who had been involved in the uprising.",
        "A: Well, a lot of them got killed. They start to run out from the camps and they killed them\non the way. Whoever starts to run, they killed them all. You know, after all, they had the\nairplanes. They had ammunition. The people hadn't got nothing. But there was an uprising, but\nan uprising Bialystok they told me. Some of the people was there. I went to see that grave. With\nlittle things, they was hiding. People was hiding bags. The only thing even people say why the\npeople didn't fight back. That's a very stupid question. When you having nothing in your hand,\nand the Gestapo stays with the...with the guns and with the dogs and they beat you up and you're\nhungry and you're thirsty, and you don't have a\u201d? How can you fight back? It's a miracle how\nthe\u201d for five weeks. With hunger, with people, with sickness. Together they wanted to...to buy a\ngun from the Polish people. And they fought for five weeks. I'll never figure...figure out how\nthey could do it when there was sickness and typhus and hunger. People was dying from the\nsickness. Nobody paid attention when somebody was dying. That's the way it was. And that's the\nway it was in the ghetto. Newstadt they put a big fence. People couldn't go out. People was\ndying. Without food. Without everything. It's...it's just a miracle somebody survived. I can't\nfigure it out myself. People can sometimes go hungry for weeks, and that's the way they survive.\nBut some of them can't. Some do. Some can't. People standing by...by every day in Auschwitz,\nyou have to go up 4 o'clock in the morning, stand in the line, shivering cold, stripped until naked.\nThat's to look for a little thing on the skin. Which we didn't have even water or anything for 7\nmonths. They put them right on the side. And a lot of them decided, it's not...it's not worth to\nlive. So they just touched the electric wire and they were dead. Decided it's no use to live a life\nlike that. We're not going to go out from here anyway. So a lot of my friends did, and a lot of\nmen did it. Suddenly, we used...we could hear the screaming through the wires in the men's\ncamp. They beat up the men, and the screaming was fill the sky. It was a horrible situation.\nNobody can...can even visualize what it was there. Unbelievable. When we came into the camp,\nwas mud til here cause it wasn't regulated, a sidewalk \u201d or anything. People put in a foot, they\ncouldn't go out. One with the other the hand just to get up from the mud.. Just managed to put on\nthe electric wires, but nothing there. But malaria and sickness and all those things. The only\nthing is the one day a Hanukkah. That as a horrible day. We was standing in the camp.\nHanukkah. I remember that day. And they need people to gas. They didn't have any transport\nfrom the outside. I mean they cut off hundreds of people, thousands. I came back to my block.\nFrom thousand girls, only three came back. The rest was gone. They had to mark the list. That's\nhow many have to be killed. Not one person could be missed. If they didn't have on the outside,\nthey took from the camp. And the camp was always a lot of people. So they just cut off 500 here,\n200 here, that's what they got. When they took them on the trucks to the crematorium, they just\nhad to push one button. Like you see sometime a truck, lift that and potatoes fell down. That's\nhow the people fell down. Every...Everything got to be fast, fast. Not to wait til they walked out.\nJust to push a button and the truck threw over and the people fell down like potatoes, one on top\nof the other. It's...it's unreal. The people doesn't even know. It's just like you put a drop in the\nocean. Whatever people saying, whatever they seen in film, it's..it's just nothing compared to the\nreality where it was.",
        "Q: How did you...you said that you came back from a thousand girls had been taken.",
        "A: Yes. Only three girls. The next day there was another transport coming in.",
        "Q: How did you escape?",
        "A: Well, we didn't escape. They just cut us off. Oh, that came out and the mike fell out. How\nyou put it in?",
        "A: I didn't escape. They just cut...",
        "Q: Wait. Wait. The tape isn't rolling yet. Okay. Now.",
        "A: Yal. The three girls. We was afraid they're going to take us too because they took away\neverybody so they built like a\u201d washroom only holes, you know. So me and those two girls\ngrabbed on a shovel \u2019and we pretend to be working here, you know, because the barrack had to\nmake room for other people coming in a couple of hours or so. So they had to make room so we\nkind of...I didn't think about it. My girlfriend told me, \"Listen, we stay here, they're gonna take\nus. You see they took everybody. Let's run over there, take a shovel \u2019\u2019and a...and a broom and\nsee...pretend that we work here.\" And in time they took away lot of people you know. Everything\nwas so fast going \u2019down. It's hard to believe it. And the people...when they took them from the\ncamp to the crematoriums was worse than when they took them from the train. They didn't know\nwhat's going down. Everything was fast. But when they took them from...from the camps, there\nwas screaming and crying. You know, when you know you're going to die, then it's worse. \u201d\nYal. See everything was lying by the Germans. They always told us that we're going to work,\nthey're going to put us in a different section. When they took in the last transport the\nCzechoslovakia Jews from Theresienstadt, they even opened up kindergarten for the schools, for\nthe kids. Everything so to take away the mind that something is going to happen. They told them,\n\"You're going to work. You're going to be in good condition. We need the people to work.\" In\nthe last minute, you know, they took them to the crematorium. You saw a show. I went with my\ndaughter to see it twice you know. So then they told them to go down to this. They say, \"Why\nyou lie to us? We want to work. Why did you did to us?\" Start to beat them up and stand naked\nand nothing...nothing then. How...how can you fight back? So they pushed them in the\ncrematorium with the families. That's how...all the time was lying. And with the lies, a lot of\npeople believed it. But when we tried to tell them, you know, you're not going to go out from\nhere alive. You see the cremator...\" They says, \"But look at the way they treat us here? They got\nspecial kindergarten for school. They keep the families together.\" So there is a sign maybe\nsomething good is going to come out. Nobody believed it. They want...they didn't want to\nbelieve it. Let's put it that way. Nobody want to believe in those things. So...everything was lying\nto the people. Lying. And...and that's it. And they always told us at work, don't...when they saw,\nthe airplanes was flying. Probably American or English. He said, \"Don't be so happy there was\nplanes. We finish you up before the war.\" Twelve o'clock will be the war over. You will be 10\nminutes before. Which they did to a lot of people. They put them in special trains. They gassed\nthem. They...they didn't...they didn't have the time the last few weeks when the Russians was\nbehind, you know. They didn't have many...if they had a little more time, not one person would\nsurvive. They didn't have the time to kill all of us. That was it. It hurts me when I see German\nnow\u201d like that. That hurts me. Even when the Germans came into our house to take away the\npossessions, you know what he says to me, \"I was here 20 years ago, but I came back.\" That\nwhat I believe the Germans will do now in 20 years.",
        "Q: I don't understand.",
        "A: When they came into the city, they go into every house. They take away the possession,\nwhat you got. He says to me, \"I was here 20 years ago in 1919, but I came back. But this time\nwe're going to stay here.\" That's how you can't trust these people. One time I was walking in\nAuschwitz and I saw...they brought up a transport with people, men on a truck, I mean. You\ncould see there was lawyers and doctors and writers. They way they was dressed. Sophisticated.\nThey didn't even give them a chance to go down. Straight to the crematorium. The intelligent\npeople didn't have a chance. If they knew somebody is well educated, they have no chance. They\nfinish him off. You could those doctors and lawyers between them. Everybody wished they have\npills to commit suicide, but we didn't have any. Everybody would do it. But beautiful dressed.\nNice, you know. And you could see. They looked around and they figure if people are working,\nmaybe we gonna work too, you know. They thought to themselves. But that wasn't the case.\nBecause I saw them driving up straight to the crematorium, because My block was like the third\nblock from the crematorium. In Birkenau. I was there 2 and a half years. I couldn't believe it.\n[...there was people that couldn't survive | day. Not | day. It's unbelievable.",
        "Q: How did you survive?",
        "A: Well, I tell you something. When some people ask me that question, I only have one\nanswer. People play on the lottery. One in 10 million wins. None of my family survived from my\nfather's and my mother's side. Only my brother who was in Russia. Nobody. They wiped out\nfamilies in our city you know. Nobody survived. Nobody. Couldn't. It...it was just a...a tragedy\nthat...that people...only one person survived even from a city would be...would be good. It wasn't\nthe case. They just wiped out...they were sure that they won the war, which they did won the war\nin Europe. Then did won the war, and they figured I'll take care of and everything you know.\nThey took in a lot of Poles too that was well educated. I have to admit it. Everybody who was a\npharmacist, a doctor, or a lawyer and come into our city, they took him immediately away to the\ncamp because they figure intelligent people might organize themselves. And the reason they\nknow who it was because...uh...there was a lot of\u201d in our city and they knew exactly the names\nand from everybody. So they get on the list, and that's...that's how they find out. If somebody\nwears a black...a black shirt, that means you are communist. They send them right away to the\ncamp. Even in 1940 and 1939. That was a symbol they say. If you wore a black, that means you\nare a communist. All kind of things. It's horrible. I don't know even...even a person could survive\nthose...those... It shows you. When I got to the doctor and I sometime and tell him...he was a\nsurvivor too, but he was hidden in Czechoslovakia. I said, \"Listen, now with the medicine.\nWould a doctor believe I was laying with typhus without medicine, not even a little bit of ice to\nput in the head which I have the highest temperature...and a little bit cold water. We was laying\non the floor and people was dying like crazy, and if you tell them, would they believed it? I was\nbeaten up in the camps with a gun and blood was running. We didn't have a mirror. We didn't\nknow how we looked. If I come home...If I came back to the block and the girls said, \"Look you\ngot so many holes in your head. So what...what...you know what the medicine was? We urine\nand we put in the head and we cleared it up. That was our medicine. It was always beaten up at\nwork. Anybody. That was their pleasure, you know. That was their pleasure. That was their\nsatisfaction to beat up anybody. And I didn't know that I was bleeding. I didn't know what's\ngoing on. I know I was beaten and I felt it, but I didn't know how I looked. Nobody know how\nthey looked. They told me, \"Listen, take a little bit urine. Wash it on the blood because \u201d . We\nwas always beaten up by the Germans. Always. The look \u201d worse than animals. Nothing. We\ncame back from work, you saw people laying dead. We had to bring in dead from the...from the\ncamp...from the work. You know, like put on a stick. Two carry here and one carry here and we\nhad to run. The dogs was after us. And we put them by their block, because they had to be\ncounted. How many die a day. Half of them die walking. Everybody was afraid to say they're\nsick you know. So they was walking. Finally, they fell. Nobody could say they're sick. If you're\nsick or you can't work, you have no right to live altogether. That doesn't go away. I can't sleep\nnights. Every night I feel like I'm in Auschwitz. And I'm running. There's a selection there.\nMaybe I'll stand in this, maybe I'll stand in this line. It's so real with screaming. Then when I get\nup in the morning, I say, \"Oh, My God. I can't believe it. Everything comes back.\nDoesn't...doesn't let you go, you know. All those things doesn't let you go.",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add?",
        "A: [...[ never told my kids all this stuff, but she's very interested. She find out from the book.\nShe made all those pictures and everything. I...[ wouldn't have the guts even to do it to tell you\nthe truth. I'm not...I come to a point I just give up a lot of things. I don't have the strength,\nanything. But she...she's very involved. She's going to make a\u201d part in the house to raise money.\nShe's in the JUF, my daughter. She's very, very much involved. She gives a lot of money. She\ntakes that after her father, you know.\u201d She gives a lot of money. She wouldn't miss any meeting\nin the JUF. She organized a group. 30 people to have a meeting in her girlfriend's house.\u201d And\nshe was running. The girl didn't left the key, \u201dso she brought her over. In the middle of the night\nshe was running so fast, she fell out. She couldn't go out from the car so in between was a doctor,\none of her friends. So they took her to an ambulance and she \u201d . She's running too much, and you\ncan't be all over, but she does it. She has that energy you know.",
        "Q: Anything else you want to tell us about Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yal. Well, that's what I told you. It was...1t was Hell. Hell on earth. Nobody ever\ndreamed that we ever went out from there. It was...the biggest optimist couldn't dream about that.\nIt was...that was the finish. That was the end, and we could feel that the Russians were behind.\nYou know they killed a lot of Russians too and they put them in the crematoriums. There were a\nlot of engineers by them. I think they helped the uprising too. A lot of Russian men, what they\nkept in the army.",

That\nhappens there. But I could see the...the Germans start to running the camps and put everybody\nback in the barracks. The whole sky was with airplanes. Sure we saw that. It was Hell to see\nthose things. You know, they scare all the people. So they pushed them back in...1n the barracks.\nOf course, I saw it. I was there. I was there a long time. Even one day was a thousand years to go\nthrough that. One day was a thousand years.",

It was well organized in\nthe future what you saw it was working like you know through the city. It was a poor life in\nPoland, but we were happy. We didn't know any other way how to live, so that was it,\u201d you\nknow. Then when the war broke out in 1939, when the Germans came in the first thing what they\ndid, they collected all the real Orthodox Jews and put into the synagogue and they had to take out\nall the, you know, and everything the...and everything and put on the sidewalk and burn them\u2019.\nOnly Jewish people have to do this. Then they started to grab people to work every single day.\nEvery Jew who walked by a building where there was a German officer, he had to kneel down\nand take off their hats when they passed by; otherwise, they would be shot, you know. Then\nwhen they came out to talk to the people, they said, \"Good morning, brother \u201d .\" He says, \"Good\nmorning, swine.\" You know what swine is? Pigs. Okay. Then they started to grab people to\nwork. All the time. Then they start to confiscate all the business what the people had. So there\nwas a lot of \u2019Holsterges living in our city, so they knew exactly the addresses and the names of\nthe people who had business. So they went in and they confiscate everything. Then while we\nwere sleeping, started to rip off the roofs from the building,...the roofs because they thought\nthey're going to make a garden in the middle of the city so the Jewish people shouldn't live there.\nSo everybody start to run to different places. They lived like 10...10 people in one small room.\nThen I got sick from typhus. Jewish people was not allowed to use a doctor or a drugstore or a\nhospital. So they...me and may womans...in the outskirts of the city in a little room.\u201d and they\nsent in a doctor, a Jewish doctor. I think he came from Germany. He had one artificial leg. There\nwas no medication and everybody was dying every day and I expect to die too, but it was a\nmiracle. After 8 weeks laying there, I kind of recovered. There was no medication or nothing.\nThey cut off the hair and everything. Then they started to take hostages...people. They want so\nmuch money. Ten and a half figures, two and a half figures. People gave away everything. They\ngot the rings, their watches, even the gold you put in your mouth, just to take all those people.\nThen...",
        "A: No. They released them. They released them. Then they organized like a Judenrat. They\nhave a release from all the people, start to make a gold star. We have to wear one on the left side\nand one on the right side, so when you walk on the street you know that you're a Jew. I went out\nfrom that thing when I recovered.\u201d There was no food. Nothing to eat. People just starving,\nfamilies. I lived in an attic. It was terrible condition, so we start to ask the Russian...German,\n\"Why don't you kill us?\" They says, \"No, we need those guns on the front. You'll die anyway.\"\nSo after a couple of months, they decided they're not going to make a ghetto. The city's too\npretty. They going to make fine building. \"It's so close \u2019through Germany. They're going to take\nhalf of them from Mlawa and half of them to \u2019Newstadt, the ghetto. We have to go out the\nmiddle of the night, all of us to...to go to a little bridge where the water was to go into that castle.\nYou know babies was crying. Somebody picked up a baby, but it's shot right away. Then inside\nwe had to go out to another...nother door. On both sides were standing the German, the black\nuniform and \u2019\u2019throwing down the rifles and beat over the head. Everybody went down. The blood\nwas running like water. Finally, we had to run the truck. They took the doctor, threw him down\non the ground, and the Gestapo stepped on his face with the feet and hand. He committed suicide\nin Auschwitz. \u201d . But then they took us to Newstadt. We came into Newstadt. There was a ghetto\nalready. In the...and we watched 20 minutes, they had to beat up a Jew. There was no place\nwhere to go in. People was running like crazy. They cut off the hair from the woman. I ran into a\nstable. That where we lived there for a couple of weeks and we organized...we made a kitchen\nwith a little bit soup to give the people. And whole families die over night.",
        "A: That unreal. First of all, no water, no food or nothing. People was dying and we was\njealous they're already dead. Finally, I found out that they hanged my uncles in the other city. I\nfound out. I didn't want to tell my aunt. So she saw me, she said what are you crying. I said,\n\"No.\" \"Did you hear something?\" I said, \"No. I didn't hear.\" I didn't want to tell her. She didn't\nknow til the last minute. Then they decided they're going to take us to Auschwitz. We didn't\nknow where we're going. They took us in those cattle trains, locked in, for 3 days and 3 nights.\nWomen are giving the babies urine to drink. It was bad. Half of them die anyway. And they took\nus ride for 3 days like that. We came out and everything got to be fast...fast. We came into\nAuschwitz. We didn't know what's going. It was in the middle of the night. THey always did it in\nthe middle of the night. They...right away, they cut off like let's say a 100 women, men, 200, a\n100 men. You could be young. You didn't have a chance. They just cut off a group. That many\nthey let into the camp. Right away, we don't see our people...anything...our parents. In a second,\nyou didn't see it. They divided. Right. Left. Right. Left. Dr. Mengele. Once they had a little\ngroup for the camps, the rest went to the crematorium. Let's say there was like 3,000 people in\nthat train. They took out 200 or 300 for the camp. Then we realized...they took us into a room\nand they told...we had to take off the clothes, everything. Cut our hair all over, and then they\ngave us those clothes. They didn't even fit. Gave us those clothes, and they took us into a\nbarrack. The barrack was...had to hold thousand people, not less. So there was their \u2019couriers.\nHow do you call it...where we in three lines. Nothing there, no\u201d blankets or nothing. Some of\nthem slept on the...on the bricks. Then about 4:00 in the morning, we had to get up and stand\nnaked even in the winter to see if we have a clear skin. There they count us in 5, a hundred in a\ngroup, and the SS with the dogs took us to work. We had to walk, let's say, maybe 10 miles a day\nto work. Many of them died on the way walking so they give us a stick to put us there dead\npeople. Two have to hold them this way. One have to hold their feet to take them to the place\nwhere we supposed to work. Then we have to bring them back because the appell. They have to\ncount the people that everybody's there. So we have to bring those dead people back, so they put\nthem like on a piece of wood two hold here and the rest of them hold here, to bring those dead\npeople because everybody gotta be counted. Then when we looked around we saw people are\nstanding in the line to get into the crematorium. No food. No bathrooms. No nothing. They want\nto get all already we be dead\u201d. The crematoriums was going for 24 hours. Day and night. Before\nyou saw \u201d\u201d\u2019 They bring transports from all over Europe, from France, from Belgium, from\nHolland, from Poland, from every country in Europe. They didn't miss one country. I think\nmaybe Norwegian they missed. The conditions in the camp was horrible. We didn't see...for 7, 8\nmonths there was no water in Auschwitz, completely. They just...just put electric wires around\nfor barracks. There was nothing else there. No water. After 7, 8 months, there's no water there.\nWe have to walk to work every day. Hungry. The lice on the whole body, all over our faces. \u201d It\nwas snowing. Beaten up. One time an SS man beat me up with the rifle. He thought I'm dead\nalready. I starts to work. Beat us up. \u201d You know just for fun. Pulled out a few people, beat us\nup. Then they gave us a piece of bread, but we didn't know, should we take a crumb every hour\nor should we swallow it right away. We couldn't figure out what to do with this. When we ate it\nup, we was sorry why we ate it up already. This way we have another crumb to eat. We was\ngoing to work...was beaten up, after work all the time, kicked us up, beat us up. \u201d That what we\nhave to do. Slapped us. Iron wagons with the bricks. You know, it wasn't actually work, but on\ntop of it just to make people work. Just to make people work. Then on Sunday, when we came\nback from work Sunday, the day off, we had to put our clothes, button up in the back and put in a\nlot of sand so one place we \u2019\u2019slept to another one. So people who couldn't run fast, the dogs went\nafter them. Always beaten up, you know. It was a helluva condition. I can't believe...I was 18\nyears old that that. I... can't visualize how people can even go through that without food, without\nwater, with everything. That was going on for 2 and a half years in...in the camp. Then when\nthey saw the Russian...the Russian are coming, they took us from Birkenau to Auschwitz. There\nwas already better buildings and a better thing. In Birkenau, I forgot to mention, that...there was\nan uprising in Birkenau. They killed a lot of Germans. They put them in the oven, but in 5\nminutes the whole sky was with so many German airplanes that you couldn't see the skies\nanymore. And everybody who was moving was killed anyway. People start to run. They wants to\nfind out how those people was organized because nobody can have a pencil or a piece of paper.\nOne of mine counselor, like a blockaltester, was 5 girls, 5 sisters from Czechoslovakia. She kind\nof tried to put on paper what's happened and she hid it in her coat and they find it. So they said\nthey're going to shot her. So the other four sisters stood by and they said, \"We want to be shot\ntoo.\" So they shot all five sisters. Then when they start to figure out how the uprising...there was\na girl...I think was her name. I forgot.\u201d I think. \u201d And she was organized this thing. So they\nwants to take her to hang her, so she cut her veins. And she slapped the SS man. He says,\n\"You're dying.\" She says, \"I die today, but you gonna die tomorrow.\" Even make a film from\nthat. Then one girl dropped...girls who brought in the evening ammunition what they smuggled\nout\u201d ammunition. One girl broke down. They beat her up and she says, \"If you tell us, what's\nhappening, you're gonna be \u2019\u2019sleep. We're not going to torture you.\" But that wasn't the...the fact.\nShe knew three other girls. That's all she knew. And one of the girls was \u201d my girlfriend. They\nbeat her up. She didn't tell anything because they would hang a lot of people if she would tell to\nwho she gave and how the things happened. The girl who gave up was the first to be hanged. The\nGerman punished her. And everybody have to stay and watch when they hang those four girls. It\nwas like in...in January. In January 18, we have to leave the camp. They announced the\nmicrophone, we...I and five girls wants to hide it between the floor. So they announced on the\nmicrophone if they catch anybody, they will be shot on the spot. So I says to the girls, \"Maybe\nit's no use to do it. It looks like the world's coming to an end to the German army. Let's go.\" So\nwe starts to walk. We couldn't walk. We have to run out from the camp. And in five in groups.\nAnd who couldn't run was shot. Right away on the spot. Some people begged, \"I want to just\ncatch my breath.\" No. If you couldn't run, you know, people haven't good shoes and all these\nthings, so they shot. And we was jealous. They are already dead, and they don't have to go\nthrough all this. Finally, they took us on a truck\u201d to get deeper to Germany. We was without\ncovers and the snow was coming on us. No boots. And then about thousand woman was walking.\nThey threw one bread. You know how many people got killed just to...I never runned for that. I\nknew. The first one got crushed already. One bread for thousand people. Such a sadistic way.\nThen they took us into Ravensbruck. In Ravensbruck, the hunger was unbelievable, terrible.\nAlready, they gonna take us to Gross Rosen, and they didn't let us in. They got a little too many\npeople, so they took us to Ravensbruck. In Ravensbruck, we was there a couple weeks and saw\nthe Russians were behind, coming, they took to from Mettlenberg, Newstadt \u201d in the camp. A\nroom like that was a few hundred women. If you lay down to sleep, you couldn't turn around.\nThere was no room. That's how you had to lay all night. This was the...we was there in that\ncamp. It was terrible. The hunger...they gave us a little piece of bread for 24 hours. It was\nunbelievable how people was dying. The end was near that camp was people...pilots...which they\nwas shot down American planes, and Canadians so the Germans locked the gate and they ran\naway. It was in...",
        "A: When the war come to a...to a finished, the German run away from that camp, from us,\nand they locked the gate. And we didn't know that the war was to end. So those people, those\npilots cut the wires...you know was divided, and told us that the war is over. The Germans went\naway. So we starts to run to the...out to get some food, you know. All the Germans from this city\nleft the houses. They knew that we come out they're gonna be killed. They knew that what was\ngoing down. So everybody left those houses...that we went into those houses, and we took food.\nWe got food for here, but we were... But I even now we was tired walking, so the same day came\nin the...the American soldiers and the Russians the same day, to Mettlenberg. And they was\nkissing each other. Thank God that the war is over, because 1n some places the Germans was still\nfighting. So there was a guy...a German guy with a wagon with horses. So we told him to give us\nthe wagon, the horses. He says, \"No.\" So a Russian officer walked by, took him by the head,\nthrew him in the..in the...in the yard. He said, \"You give them everything they wanted.\" The\nRussians said that like this. They were very nice to us. Real nice. So we took the horses and the\nwagon and we start to go out closer to the city. Then when the night came over, we took out a\nhouse, and we went the house to stay overnight. Part of the way was a lot of soldiers. You know,\nthey let out from Russia, from the jail everything, and there was a rape of a lot of girls. So one\nRussian officer came in, a very intelligent man, and he says, \"Listen, the war is over. There's a\nlot of people came out from the jail. They do bad things. We can't control it. But I'm going to sit\nhere a whole night and watch you.\" We were 10 girls togethers, which was nice. He was sitting.\nWhile he was sitting, they knocked on the door. They saw coming in. So he went to the door.\nThey ran away. They was afraid for him. So he says, \"I can't protect you anymore,\" he says. You\ntake...try to take the trains and go to Berlin because in the city will be more protected. So we\nwent on a train. The trains happened like there was going for an hour and 6 hours there was\nstanding. It was broken off. We went in the train. We was together 10 girls. And Russian soldiers\ncame in and they took I imagine they saw girls. They says, \"We're going to bring our friends\nhere.\" While he was in the other side, we ran out from the train. The train was standing. And\nthere was a lot of broken trains. So we decided every girl would go, lay down under a train. In\nthe morning, we will board it. We were laying like that a whole under those broken trains. You\nknow, every girl. In...In the morning, we got up. The train left already with our stuff and\neverything. We didn't care already. So we starts to go from one city to the other til we got into\nBerlin. Well, being in Berlin, we didn't have any families. We didn't have anybody. They wasn't\nwell organized like after the war, so we decided we're going back to Poland. Because we got\nsome property there, we're going back to Poland. So 10 girls came back to Poland. We didn't\nrealize that Poland was worse than with \u2019the Germans. They didn't want any Jew to come there\nbecause then they claim their properties. So they didn't want us. So when you went out on the\nstreet, you saw laying dead Jews, which they came back from Russia or from the army. They\nweren't missed by nobody. They didn't have any family, so nobody knew who they are. Their\nfamilies was killed, and they sneaked out from Russia in 1945. So all the time you saw. So\nfinally, what we gonna do? I came back to my city. With five other girls, went in a house. The\n\u201d\u2019 Army Kiova went in and they killed those girls. One was under the bed. They didn't know that\nshe's alive. She's 9 years old.\u201d . Anyway, they saw a Jew, they killed it. They wasn't missed by\nnobody. So we decided it's not good we...in the city either. So we went to Lodz. I went. A few...a\nfew remained. They got boyfriends right away. I went to Lodz. I came to Lodz. I went into a\nkibbutz. We got a roof over there. There's something to eat. Israel wasn't established in that time.\nI was in Lodz. So one group went to a different city for a...a reunion. They took off 4 boys...I\nshouldn't have bring their picture, I think I got. They took off four boys and a girl and they killed\nthem right away, from the train. It was 18 or 19 year olds. So you could only be in that kibbutz 6\nmonths. We have to smuggle our way to Lodz. I find out that my brother is alive in Russia. I\nwant to wait for him. So I went to Bialystok. > We went into a kibbutz. He was there. Another\nkapo man. Meantime, my brother came. The police came in one night and this...told us there're\ngoing to pogram. They're going to kill us. So every 2 hours, 2 other men were standing. In time,\n5 people went back to Lodz, those of us who want to\u201d want to go.",
        "A: Five people went to \u2019Valsa from that kibbutz. Yal.\u201d\u2019. In time, one boy saw what's going\nto come. He was hiding by another lady, she had a\u201d . So they didn't see that boy. All the other 12\nwas killed. So he told us in Bialystok\u201d that they was killed. He came into \u201dValsa. It's\nunbelievable. People don't realize how many Jews were killed after the war from the Polish end.\nThe reason I was still in Poland...I didn't go to Israel\u2019\u2019, I was waiting for my brother. I know I had\nonly one...one brother. He was alive. So I was waiting in Bialystok\u201d. Then the Brichah saw that\ntoo many Jews get killed in Poland, and we had to go out. But they came in...People start the\nkilling for Russia because about half a million Jews escaped to Russia when the war started. But\nthey start to come back. Some of them got killed in\u201d . Some of them died. Some of them came\nback....the children. They came back to the Brichah, took us to Czechoslovakia. You have to\nwork to the Polish. You took a train to Czechoslovakia. And over there, their parents was waiting\nfor us.\u201d You couldn't stay too long in Czechoslovakia. We had to go to Austria. We came to\nAustria in the barracks. I didn't have nothing to eat. We had to run in...in to the fields and catch a\ncarrot or potato to eat, because they wasn't prepared for that. So in time, my husband had a\ncouple of brothers in Russia.",
        "A: Yes. Well, I was standing like this...he...my husband was liberated in Austria. He didn't\nwant to leave there. They gave him a hotel and they put a few people for those they were\nhousing. The day he\u201d boat is coming and some brothers in Russia, so he came to see if he'll find\nsomebody. There's only people from Russia . They stood in Germany or in Austria. I said, \"Well,\nthe reason I went back to Poland, I knew I wanted to see if somebody 1s alive from Russia.\" My\nbrother. So I stood there a year in Poland. You couldn't leave Poland. The...the Russian was\nthere. You couldn't leave Poland, when the Russian was there. You couldn't leave Poland.\u201d \u201d\nBut the Brichah somehow got those people out from Poland to Czechoslovakia. And I met my\nhusband and he told me that he had papers to go to the United States. A second cousin signed the\npapers. If I marry, I can be on those papers. So I says, \"I have no choice. Either I wasn't\nestablished. I was sick and tired from...from all this life. I couldn't take it anymore. So I says,\n\"Okay.\" But only if my brother goes with me, but it took the government in Austria to let him in\nbecause you not supposed leave the city.\u201d, only the \u201d . So I got married. Right? After a week, I\ngot married. We stood in Austria and we was waiting to immigrating to America. Here. But my\nbrother couldn't. Only me because I was on the paper. When I came to America, it wasn't like\nnow. They have...because we had a sponsor. That sponsor had to be a very cruel man. He got the\npapers for somebody else. So when we came here, we couldn't have any help from nobody. On\nthe third day, I went to work down town. You know, I got work right away, and my husband\ncouldn't get a job. I got a job. I start to work. I work overtime. I worked all the time, just to make\na little money. I said, \"I don't want to be poor. I can't be without shoes, without clothes.\" And I\nstart to work....",
        "A: [...work in a...not factory...making suits, ladies suits and clothes, you know. So I was\nthere, kind of fast piece work. I worked all the time. Then my husband couldn't get a job, so\nsomebody told us to open up a little cleaning store in a PolishOJewish neighborhood. My\nhusband didn't speak English. I speak a little bit. So we opened up that store. After work, I came\nin and worked in the clothing store til 12 o'clock at night to make a few dollars to get an\napartment, you know. So after 2 years like that, then I have my children. And I had an apartment\nand I had a little money in the bank. I had the two children. My daughters are very well educated.\nThey all finished college. And I had...my oldest will have a Masters from Harvard College. They\ntook piano lessons 10 years, went to Hebrew school. All those things. My younger daughter is a\nlab technician. She got a good profession. She got married. Now she is India. (crying) If not, for\nher I wouldn't be alive. Only for her, I'm living. Not for me. (crying) You know, I can't sleep\nbecause all the pictures what we went through doesn't go away. When I sleep with my\ndaughter...you see I live along my husband died 14 years old. When I live along, I don't know\nhow I sleep. When I sleep with my daughter, all coming back to \u201d . Cause I'm screaming,\nsometimes running, screaming and standing by the crematorium. That don't go away.\u201d I'm\nalways screaming because it's very real and I dream about it.\u201d and I don't know what's going on\nyou know. But the only thing, if I would...1f I wouldn't have my daughter because she's so good\nto me, it's unbelievable, I wouldn't be alive. I would finish my life because you have no relatives.\nOn holidays or something, nobody's there. And I thought if I sleep three hours a night that's a lot.\nI can't fall asleep. Never. All the things comes back. I's real like I'm in Auschwitz. \u201d No matter\nhow much you try, you just can't go away all those things. \u201d What else do you want to know?",
        "A: Yal. I'm alright now. So if it's not for my brother, I would finish my life. Even though my\nother daughter is well educated, she is not as close to me as that one, you know\u201d. Yal. She's very\ngood. She calls me every day. In the morning when she gets up, before she goes to sleep. They\ngo trips. They always take me with, you know, so she's really my...my life. Without her, I\nwouldn't survive. You know, the older you get, the weaker you get to take all those things you\nknow. The...it...it's harder to take, you know, when you think about all those things. It doesn't go\naway. Never goes away. The picture. All those pictures. When you laying in a stable, you haven't\ngot work to eat, and you jealous the others die and I didn't. All those things doesn't go away.\nNever. I can see some people twill their little foot or something. That is unreal to me. And people\nwas starving like that, but what the Germans did, I\u2019 don't think nobody can even put in words.\nAll those things what happened. It's impossible to describe those things. Just impossible.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Yal. Seven people together",
        "A: Yal. Well, when they took us out from the city to the ghetto, there still was Jewish people\nin the \u2019Channo. They need them for work so my uncle decided he'll go back with...with the\ndaughter, you now. He was hiding in a attic, and for some reason the German find out about it.\nSome of them went a running back. They shot them right on the spot, you know, when they\ncatched them on the way. \u201d . They took my uncle, and they took the men whose house was there,\nand my cousin, a couple from another city, a boy, Lindenberg from my city. And because my\nuncle have a brother, the brother have to be hanged too. Usually when they hanged people, they\nsold tickets that the Germans going to be show. When they hanged my city, I wasn't there when\nthey hanged the five people. Two they hanged because they was hiding there. They throw around\nthe things on the cemetery to find out. So they hanged two people. Then the hanged five other\npeople, and the family...and they warned them if they cried, they'd be shot so they have to stay\nand watch it for 3 hours, from 6 to 9. Mine uncles, because they were prominent people, they\npaid off the Gestapo, they should make execution another city, so the family shouldn't stay and\nwatch that. So they took it to *Mettlenberg, a different city and that happened in \u201d , and they\nhanged those seven people. Mine cousin was fighting back and they shot her. She didn't want to\nwalk up to the hanging. There was seven people. When I find out, I was in the ghetto. Mine...my\naunt didn't know about it. I didn't want to tell her I find out. Then when I was in Auschwitz, I\nthought to myself if I ever survive, that's the only thing what I'm going to do is look for my\nbrother who went to Russia and dig out those people. So I picked myself up and I went to this\ncity, but a couple of Jews are there already. I walked into them and I told them to help me how to\ngo through with that. I know it's not a easy thing.",
        "A: After the war. Yal. They helped me. They helped me. They have to have a permit. They\nput them in one casket, all these things, and we got them on the Jewish cemetery. Then, a day\nlater, I walked out to make a march on this little thing. I was arrested by the Polish people. So\nwhat are you doing on the cemetery. I said, \"Well, I have to put a\u201d\u2019 because I'm going to leave\nthis country.\" He says, \"You are a spy.\" I said, \"How am I spy when I have number on my hand.\nI was in Auschwitz for 2 and a half years.\" He said, \"Everybody could make a number.\" So they\narrested me. \"You're on the cemetery. You're a spy.\" So finally, they let me out, you know. They\nfinally let me out. I was glad to leave that country. It's hard to believe it, what the Polish people\ndid to the Jew. It's just unbelievable. If a person went in, he didn't go out alive. When I was in the\nghetto, it was...uh...a Jewish man. He was a\u201d. You know what a\u201d means. So he divided\nbetween son...the son was by one family, and he was by another family.\u201d He had to have in the\nmorning girls. And he paid off those Polish people. After the war, the guy come up...he's 9\nyears...their older son. I saw him when I was in Europe. He came out. He went into the other\nfamily to look for the father, but the father wasn't there. So he took a few Russian people and\nstarted to dig up in the basement and he was buried. They took the money, but they killed him on\ntop of it. So the son\u201d by a different family. He was by a different family. It's unbelievable, you\nknow. It's unbelievable. The Jewish people came back. They have a house. They figured they'd\ngo and take the papers and get back. They walked in the house. They didn't come out alive. I\nhave a close girlfriend now. She was in there from Warsaw, and she was hiding in the woods.\nShe was lost in there. After the war, she came back to the girlfriend what she went to school\ntogether, and she says, \"Could I sleep over by you til I get organized and we go further.\" She\nsays, \"Yes, you can sleep by me.\" While she was in bed, she hear the brother came in and he\nsaid, \"What? You\u201d took in a Jew? I'll kill her. I'll cut off her head.\" So she ran out through the\nwindow. Luckily, she wasn't sleeping. She heard that. So she ran out from the window. What?\nYou gonna save \u2019a Jew? After the war, mind you. That's how it was in Poland. It was a very\ndanger life in Poland. I was there almost a year waiting for my brother came back from Russia.\nOtherwise I wouldn't probably stay that long over there. But it's unbelievable what's happened,\nyou know. People come back. When we came into Czechoslovakia, the Brichah took us out. The\nRussians...they pick them up like a piece of bread, a little milk to get from the kitchen to\neverybody. They are different from people to people. The Czechoslovakian didn't know people\nare coming. They all run up and give away the last piece of bread.\u201d In Poland, \u201d . That's the way\nthe situation was in Poland. It's unbelievable. I was glad to leave Europe. When I went back to\nIsrael, they asked me, Don't you want\u201d \"Don't you want to go to Poland to the \u201d ?\" I says, \"I\ndon't want to look at their faces anymore. I don't want to have nothing to do with these people.\"\nThat's the memories of these people.",
        "A: Yal. Yal.",
        "A: The selection.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Yal",
        "A: Yal. Well. Well, people decided that we're never going to go out alive from there. There\nwas no question about it. The told us every day, \"If the world finished 12 o'clock, 10 before 12,\nyou be killed.\" That's what they tell us. But when the Russians start to come to Poland and the\nGermans start to lose the war, they start to take apart the crematoriums. They didn't want a see\nanything left. One was left. The...all the other five was done with it, so the people have to take\napart. So we smelled in the air that the war eventually will come to an end, but we not going to\ngo out alive, because that's what they told us. So the people decided they going to make uprising\nthere. The only way...they didn't having nothing, so a lot of girls works in a union. They called\nthe union where they maked ammunition. So the girls smuggled out \u2019after work and they gave it\nto the men to through the wires you know. A lot of men came into Birkenau camps, so they put a\ncontract. They came into work in the camp. So they gave them this ammunition. Took maybe a\nyear to organize that. And they decided that one day they gonna cut the wires, run and kill\nthe...few SS what they were there. Well, it wasn't the case like that because the Polish\nunderground supposed to come to help. They never show up. You see, they never show up, so\nthe 10 kids...soon they start to kill a couple of Germans, they put them in the oven and cut the\nwires, the whole sky was with airplanes, Germans. You didn't see the sky. Just airplanes. And\nthey start to shot down the people start to run. Out you know. And then the start to investigate.\nThey want to know how the whole thing was organized. And they start to beat up those girls who\nwork and that only one girl broke down. She couldn't take it anymore, and she told them...she tell\nthem to leave her alone. So she only knew the three other girls. In between those three was my\ngirlfriend. We went to school together. Well, they beat them up in the office. I have a girl what\nshe was a secretary there and she told them this. Stripped them naked, and they beat them up\nwith that...how do you call it? Uh...",
        "A: A whip. Yes. And the whip was between was steel. They whipped them up on the body\nand a doctor was reviving them they should tell. Well, they never told anything anymore. And\nthen decided they're going to hang them. And that's what they did. Like in January. But 2 weeks\nbefore, they took us up on the camps, and we had to run. The Germans...because the Russians\nwere behind, you know. And they hanged those four girls and everybody had to stay and watch it\nwhile they hang those those girls. That was the end.",
        "A: Well, a lot of them got killed. They start to run out from the camps and they killed them\non the way. Whoever starts to run, they killed them all. You know, after all, they had the\nairplanes. They had ammunition. The people hadn't got nothing. But there was an uprising, but\nan uprising Bialystok they told me. Some of the people was there. I went to see that grave. With\nlittle things, they was hiding. People was hiding bags. The only thing even people say why the\npeople didn't fight back. That's a very stupid question. When you having nothing in your hand,\nand the Gestapo stays with the...with the guns and with the dogs and they beat you up and you're\nhungry and you're thirsty, and you don't have a\u201d? How can you fight back? It's a miracle how\nthe\u201d for five weeks. With hunger, with people, with sickness. Together they wanted to...to buy a\ngun from the Polish people. And they fought for five weeks. I'll never figure...figure out how\nthey could do it when there was sickness and typhus and hunger. People was dying from the\nsickness. Nobody paid attention when somebody was dying. That's the way it was. And that's the\nway it was in the ghetto. Newstadt they put a big fence. People couldn't go out. People was\ndying. Without food. Without everything. It's...it's just a miracle somebody survived. I can't\nfigure it out myself. People can sometimes go hungry for weeks, and that's the way they survive.\nBut some of them can't. Some do. Some can't. People standing by...by every day in Auschwitz,\nyou have to go up 4 o'clock in the morning, stand in the line, shivering cold, stripped until naked.\nThat's to look for a little thing on the skin. Which we didn't have even water or anything for 7\nmonths. They put them right on the side. And a lot of them decided, it's not...it's not worth to\nlive. So they just touched the electric wire and they were dead. Decided it's no use to live a life\nlike that. We're not going to go out from here anyway. So a lot of my friends did, and a lot of\nmen did it. Suddenly, we used...we could hear the screaming through the wires in the men's\ncamp. They beat up the men, and the screaming was fill the sky. It was a horrible situation.\nNobody can...can even visualize what it was there. Unbelievable. When we came into the camp,\nwas mud til here cause it wasn't regulated, a sidewalk \u201d or anything. People put in a foot, they\ncouldn't go out. One with the other the hand just to get up from the mud.. Just managed to put on\nthe electric wires, but nothing there. But malaria and sickness and all those things. The only\nthing is the one day a Hanukkah. That as a horrible day. We was standing in the camp.\nHanukkah. I remember that day. And they need people to gas. They didn't have any transport\nfrom the outside. I mean they cut off hundreds of people, thousands. I came back to my block.\nFrom thousand girls, only three came back. The rest was gone. They had to mark the list. That's\nhow many have to be killed. Not one person could be missed. If they didn't have on the outside,\nthey took from the camp. And the camp was always a lot of people. So they just cut off 500 here,\n200 here, that's what they got. When they took them on the trucks to the crematorium, they just\nhad to push one button. Like you see sometime a truck, lift that and potatoes fell down. That's\nhow the people fell down. Every...Everything got to be fast, fast. Not to wait til they walked out.\nJust to push a button and the truck threw over and the people fell down like potatoes, one on top\nof the other. It's...it's unreal. The people doesn't even know. It's just like you put a drop in the\nocean. Whatever people saying, whatever they seen in film, it's..it's just nothing compared to the\nreality where it was.",
        "A: Yes. Only three girls. The next day there was another transport coming in.",
        "A: Well, we didn't escape. They just cut us off. Oh, that came out and the mike fell out. How\nyou put it in?",
        "A: I didn't escape. They just cut...",
        "A: Yal. The three girls. We was afraid they're going to take us too because they took away\neverybody so they built like a\u201d washroom only holes, you know. So me and those two girls\ngrabbed on a shovel \u2019and we pretend to be working here, you know, because the barrack had to\nmake room for other people coming in a couple of hours or so. So they had to make room so we\nkind of...I didn't think about it. My girlfriend told me, \"Listen, we stay here, they're gonna take\nus. You see they took everybody. Let's run over there, take a shovel \u2019\u2019and a...and a broom and\nsee...pretend that we work here.\" And in time they took away lot of people you know. Everything\nwas so fast going \u2019down. It's hard to believe it. And the people...when they took them from the\ncamp to the crematoriums was worse than when they took them from the train. They didn't know\nwhat's going down. Everything was fast. But when they took them from...from the camps, there\nwas screaming and crying. You know, when you know you're going to die, then it's worse. \u201d\nYal. See everything was lying by the Germans. They always told us that we're going to work,\nthey're going to put us in a different section. When they took in the last transport the\nCzechoslovakia Jews from Theresienstadt, they even opened up kindergarten for the schools, for\nthe kids. Everything so to take away the mind that something is going to happen. They told them,\n\"You're going to work. You're going to be in good condition. We need the people to work.\" In\nthe last minute, you know, they took them to the crematorium. You saw a show. I went with my\ndaughter to see it twice you know. So then they told them to go down to this. They say, \"Why\nyou lie to us? We want to work. Why did you did to us?\" Start to beat them up and stand naked\nand nothing...nothing then. How...how can you fight back? So they pushed them in the\ncrematorium with the families. That's how...all the time was lying. And with the lies, a lot of\npeople believed it. But when we tried to tell them, you know, you're not going to go out from\nhere alive. You see the cremator...\" They says, \"But look at the way they treat us here? They got\nspecial kindergarten for school. They keep the families together.\" So there is a sign maybe\nsomething good is going to come out. Nobody believed it. They want...they didn't want to\nbelieve it. Let's put it that way. Nobody want to believe in those things. So...everything was lying\nto the people. Lying. And...and that's it. And they always told us at work, don't...when they saw,\nthe airplanes was flying. Probably American or English. He said, \"Don't be so happy there was\nplanes. We finish you up before the war.\" Twelve o'clock will be the war over. You will be 10\nminutes before. Which they did to a lot of people. They put them in special trains. They gassed\nthem. They...they didn't...they didn't have the time the last few weeks when the Russians was\nbehind, you know. They didn't have many...if they had a little more time, not one person would\nsurvive. They didn't have the time to kill all of us. That was it. It hurts me when I see German\nnow\u201d like that. That hurts me. Even when the Germans came into our house to take away the\npossessions, you know what he says to me, \"I was here 20 years ago, but I came back.\" That\nwhat I believe the Germans will do now in 20 years.",
        "A: When they came into the city, they go into every house. They take away the possession,\nwhat you got. He says to me, \"I was here 20 years ago in 1919, but I came back. But this time\nwe're going to stay here.\" That's how you can't trust these people. One time I was walking in\nAuschwitz and I saw...they brought up a transport with people, men on a truck, I mean. You\ncould see there was lawyers and doctors and writers. They way they was dressed. Sophisticated.\nThey didn't even give them a chance to go down. Straight to the crematorium. The intelligent\npeople didn't have a chance. If they knew somebody is well educated, they have no chance. They\nfinish him off. You could those doctors and lawyers between them. Everybody wished they have\npills to commit suicide, but we didn't have any. Everybody would do it. But beautiful dressed.\nNice, you know. And you could see. They looked around and they figure if people are working,\nmaybe we gonna work too, you know. They thought to themselves. But that wasn't the case.\nBecause I saw them driving up straight to the crematorium, because My block was like the third\nblock from the crematorium. In Birkenau. I was there 2 and a half years. I couldn't believe it.\n[...there was people that couldn't survive | day. Not | day. It's unbelievable.",
        "A: Well, I tell you something. When some people ask me that question, I only have one\nanswer. People play on the lottery. One in 10 million wins. None of my family survived from my\nfather's and my mother's side. Only my brother who was in Russia. Nobody. They wiped out\nfamilies in our city you know. Nobody survived. Nobody. Couldn't. It...it was just a...a tragedy\nthat...that people...only one person survived even from a city would be...would be good. It wasn't\nthe case. They just wiped out...they were sure that they won the war, which they did won the war\nin Europe. Then did won the war, and they figured I'll take care of and everything you know.\nThey took in a lot of Poles too that was well educated. I have to admit it. Everybody who was a\npharmacist, a doctor, or a lawyer and come into our city, they took him immediately away to the\ncamp because they figure intelligent people might organize themselves. And the reason they\nknow who it was because...uh...there was a lot of\u201d in our city and they knew exactly the names\nand from everybody. So they get on the list, and that's...that's how they find out. If somebody\nwears a black...a black shirt, that means you are communist. They send them right away to the\ncamp. Even in 1940 and 1939. That was a symbol they say. If you wore a black, that means you\nare a communist. All kind of things. It's horrible. I don't know even...even a person could survive\nthose...those... It shows you. When I got to the doctor and I sometime and tell him...he was a\nsurvivor too, but he was hidden in Czechoslovakia. I said, \"Listen, now with the medicine.\nWould a doctor believe I was laying with typhus without medicine, not even a little bit of ice to\nput in the head which I have the highest temperature...and a little bit cold water. We was laying\non the floor and people was dying like crazy, and if you tell them, would they believed it? I was\nbeaten up in the camps with a gun and blood was running. We didn't have a mirror. We didn't\nknow how we looked. If I come home...If I came back to the block and the girls said, \"Look you\ngot so many holes in your head. So what...what...you know what the medicine was? We urine\nand we put in the head and we cleared it up. That was our medicine. It was always beaten up at\nwork. Anybody. That was their pleasure, you know. That was their pleasure. That was their\nsatisfaction to beat up anybody. And I didn't know that I was bleeding. I didn't know what's\ngoing on. I know I was beaten and I felt it, but I didn't know how I looked. Nobody know how\nthey looked. They told me, \"Listen, take a little bit urine. Wash it on the blood because \u201d . We\nwas always beaten up by the Germans. Always. The look \u201d worse than animals. Nothing. We\ncame back from work, you saw people laying dead. We had to bring in dead from the...from the\ncamp...from the work. You know, like put on a stick. Two carry here and one carry here and we\nhad to run. The dogs was after us. And we put them by their block, because they had to be\ncounted. How many die a day. Half of them die walking. Everybody was afraid to say they're\nsick you know. So they was walking. Finally, they fell. Nobody could say they're sick. If you're\nsick or you can't work, you have no right to live altogether. That doesn't go away. I can't sleep\nnights. Every night I feel like I'm in Auschwitz. And I'm running. There's a selection there.\nMaybe I'll stand in this, maybe I'll stand in this line. It's so real with screaming. Then when I get\nup in the morning, I say, \"Oh, My God. I can't believe it. Everything comes back.\nDoesn't...doesn't let you go, you know. All those things doesn't let you go.",
        "A: [...[ never told my kids all this stuff, but she's very interested. She find out from the book.\nShe made all those pictures and everything. I...[ wouldn't have the guts even to do it to tell you\nthe truth. I'm not...I come to a point I just give up a lot of things. I don't have the strength,\nanything. But she...she's very involved. She's going to make a\u201d part in the house to raise money.\nShe's in the JUF, my daughter. She's very, very much involved. She gives a lot of money. She\ntakes that after her father, you know.\u201d She gives a lot of money. She wouldn't miss any meeting\nin the JUF. She organized a group. 30 people to have a meeting in her girlfriend's house.\u201d And\nshe was running. The girl didn't left the key, \u201dso she brought her over. In the middle of the night\nshe was running so fast, she fell out. She couldn't go out from the car so in between was a doctor,\none of her friends. So they took her to an ambulance and she \u201d . She's running too much, and you\ncan't be all over, but she does it. She has that energy you know.",
        "A: Yal. Well, that's what I told you. It was...1t was Hell. Hell on earth. Nobody ever\ndreamed that we ever went out from there. It was...the biggest optimist couldn't dream about that.\nIt was...that was the finish. That was the end, and we could feel that the Russians were behind.\nYou know they killed a lot of Russians too and they put them in the crematoriums. There were a\nlot of engineers by them. I think they helped the uprising too. A lot of Russian men, what they\nkept in the army.",
        "A: Oh, sure I was there. I saw it.",
        "A: Well, what I couldn't see, when they took in the Germans and put them in the oven, they\nkill a lot of...this I couldn't see because that happened in the sonderkommander. It feel out. That\nhappens there. But I could see the...the Germans start to running the camps and put everybody\nback in the barracks. The whole sky was with airplanes. Sure we saw that. It was Hell to see\nthose things. You know, they scare all the people. So they pushed them back in...1n the barracks.\nOf course, I saw it. I was there. I was there a long time. Even one day was a thousand years to go\nthrough that. One day was a thousand years.",
        "A: Oh, you're welcome. You're very nice to...to get out of the system. I'm very glad that I\ngoing to do that. I'll give those two books you know. I'll donate those two books.\n"
