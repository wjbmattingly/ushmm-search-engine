        "Q: Okay, for the record give us your name and a little bit about your early background?",
        "A: My name is Herbert Friedman. And my early background is really very simple. I was\nborn in New Haven in 1918. My father had migrated to the States from Vilna, my mother\nfrom Riga, good stock. The two of them, they met and married in Connecticut I think it\nwas, and that's where I grew up. I went to high school there, I went to university there,\nand graduated from Yale in 1938. Two brothers, both of whom are still living. A strong,\ntight, good Jewish family. Conservative congregation in town. Quite modern in those\ndays, from my parents, men and women sitting together, organ in the congregation. The\nRabbi, a wonderful person, himself Vilna-born, but took a Ph.D. at Yale, writing three\nvolumes of the history of the Jews of Russia in English. I mean that was a man, good\nbrain, good human being, and working in this small middle class ordinary congregation,\nnothing famous about him, but very impressive to me.",
        "Q: What was your awareness of the rise of Hitler as you were growing up?",
        "A: Well, that's the whole story. The whole story of my life revolves around that. In college\nbetween the years of 1934 to '38, formative years, fully cognizant of what was happening,\nas fully as anybody could be who watched carefully. The argument that people didn't\nknow what was going on in those days has never never seemed valid to me because you\ncould read it in the New York Times. I did. If I did, others did. But at any rate, it bothered\nme when I looked around '34, '35, '36, in '36 the Nuremberg laws were passed. It was\nquite clear what the intent was. Hitler's book was out. He had been in jail in Landsberg,\nhe wrote it there back in 1925. The book was available to be read. I read parts of it. It's\nturgid writing, it's not easy, Mein Kampf, but never mind you've got the picture. So that I\ncould not understand the silence of the whole American Jewish Community around me. I\ndid understand some of the politics. There was a difference quite clear in those days\nbetween the \"Ost-Juden,\" the Russian-Polish Jews and the German Jews. The American\nJewish Committee was in correspondence with people in Berlin who were advising them\nquiet, don't raise a fuss, you'll make it worse, don't organize protests, no, don't listen to\nStephen Wise, don't have a parade down Fifth Avenue, and they were attracted by that\nkind of advice, they were even enchanted by it. It gave them a perfect rationalization.\nNow, there not the only villain in the piece, everybody latched on to that. So I don't want\nto be misunderstood about the American Jewish Committee only or specifically. The\nmood was (a) we're not sure of what's happening, (b) it can't be as bad as some people are\nsaying it is, (c) what can we do about it anyhow, and (d) the American Government isn't\ndisturbed, and Franklin Roosevelt is a great friend of the Jews and he isn't upset. Nobody\nis upset. All of these factors seemed to me to be leading to a dreadful conclusion. So on\nthe specific point of how I was reacting in terms of what I saw around me, I was getting\nmore and more furious, that's a worthwhile word, and frustrated and that was the\ncondition that I felt I was in when I was 19 years old and had graduated from the\nuniversity, okay.",
        "Q: You graduated as a young man\u2019?",
        "A: Young, yes.",
        "Q: And then what did you decide to do?",
        "A: Well, don't forget we were at the tail end of the Depression, and a man in New York by\nthe name of Samuel Leidesdorf, a big accounting firm, and a major factor in the New\nYork, UJA -- well, it wasn't yet the UJA, it was the Palestine Appeal, said to me I'll give\nyou a job as an accountant for $25.00 a week if you'll go to Columbia Business School\nand learn accounting. So, okay, $25.00 a week, and so I went to Columbia Graduate\nSchool of Business, stayed one year, couldn't stand it for another day, couldn't dream of\nmyself as being an accountant, so I quit.",
        "Q: $25.00 --",
        "A: A week.",
        "Q: -- was the equivalent today of what?",
        "A: Oh, gosh, I don't know. 30 times that amount, $700.00, $800.00 a week. A very good job.",
        "Q: So it was a nice starting salary?",
        "A: Oh, yes, a nice starting salary, perfectly acceptable. Tuition was $450.00 at Yale. Today\nit's $23,500.00. So that there I was, I was at the end, I owed money to Yale, I owed\nmoney to Columbia and it's now 1939, the war has not yet broken out in Europe but it's\nimminent, and America is 1n a totally isolationist mood, no thought of participating in it.\nRoosevelt was jockeying like mad to give the British some support and so he was making\nthese funny deals called lend/lease, we will lend you some of our destroyers on lease, you\nwill pay us rent for our destroyers, but we're not going to get into your war. So it was\nreally so ambivalent and so confused and so costly in the long run. At any rate my\npersonal requirements were that I had better go and get a job. So I went back to New\nHaven and got a job in a factory working at a sewing machine making blankets. I worked\ntwo shifts, 16 hours a day, and I earned enough money to pay back all the debts. And I\nalso did the most important thing at that stage in my life, I decided what I really wanted\nto do.",
        "Q: Which was?",
        "A: I tried to figure out during all those mindless hours at the machine where all you're trying\nto do is keep your hand away from the needle which you're just feeding cloth through and\nit's robot work, and I said why should I continue being so frustrated. If the American\nJewish Community isn't awake why don't I try to awaken them, but how do you do that.\nThat's when I decided that I would become a rabbi, not because of any theological sudden\ninsights, I had no epiphanies, I had no -- I conceived of myself really as a civil servant.\nAnd if I had a platform from which to speak I would use that platform to try to wake\npeople up. It was sort of simplistic, very idealistic, but satisfying to me. On the other\nhand, again I felt I'm stopping myself for at least three years from getting into any action\nmode and yet I'd better do that or else I'll be frustrated the rest of my life. So I finished\nwith the factory, backed off, went to rabbinical seminary with Stephen Wise in New\nYork, and we did four year's worth of work in three, no summer vacations, no nothing,\n11-1/2 months you worked, two weeks off, and kept going that way.",
        "Q: What was the mood in rabbinical school, were students preparing for a career, was there a\nsense of --",
        "A: Well, Wise being the person he was and focused the way he was, every one of the\nstudents in the school became acutely sensitized to the current events around us. So, sure,\neverybody was preparing for a career, you needed to get a pulpit or a job somewhere to\nearn your living, but the ideology was developing among this group before the school\nmerged with the Hebrew Union College out in Cincinnati. It graduated about 220 reform\nrabbis, but reform rabbis of a totally different kind than Cincinnati was producing. I sat\nfor all those years next to a fellow by the name of Osher Krishblu- (e or m?) who later\nbecame the Chairman of the Misrachi, and he sat with his kippa and I sat without a kippa\nand the whole faculty liked it that way and Wise liked it that way, and the dean, Henry\nSlominski liked it that way, it was a school in which \"Klal Israel\" or pluralism or\nwhatever word you want to use, which is so fashionable today, was really being practiced\nin the '30s and '40s, the only school in which it was being carried out as a definite\nideological objective, and every student picked it up.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about Stephen Wise, his school, what was his role in this, what was his\nrole in the American Jewish Community at that time?",
        "A: Well, his role in the American Jewish Community was superb. He was the leader of the\nprotest, the ceaseless effort to try to persuade Roosevelt, to whom he had automatic\naccess, Rabbi Stephen Wise was acceptable to Roosevelt at request, and saw him\nfrequently. He failed to convince him of anything, but Wise was the pusher, Wise was the\nageressor seeking to have a large protest meeting in Madison Square Garden, and we'll\nget 25,000 people there or 20,000 whatever the Garden holds. And he filled it every time,\ntalking about the fact we must do something. He sounded -- he was the only one who\nsounded the tocsin, the call, he was the bugle. Almost no response except in those of us\nwho were listening to him very very carefully and very closely. I adored him, I admired\nhim, I respected him. The personal impact used to come on Thursday mornings. Thursday\nmorning he had a class called problems of the ministry. A big round table, seminar table,\n18, 12 students around the table. And problems of the ministry or how do you conduct a\nwedding how do you conduct a funeral? Nothing of the sort. He would go into his pocket,\nhe would take out the latest telegram that he got from the World Jewish Congress,\nRiegner in Geneva, and because he was a key player in the World Jewish Congress he\nstarted the American Jewish Congress, he believed in Democracy and he had hoped that\nthose organizations would really be democratic in the sense every member would vote for\nits officiers. It never happened that way in practice, but in theory it was at that time the\nmost democratic, and still to this day the most liberal organization I think in existence in\nthe panoply of our alphabet soup. So he would take the telegram out and tell us what was\nthe latest stuff going on in Europe in this camp or that camp, or this ghetto or another.",
        "Q: So you were with him in the period of '39 through --",
        "A: '39 to '43. I left in '43. I graduated, I went out to Denver to take a --",
        "Q: Did you know of the existence of Riegner telegram?",
        "A: Sure. We students knew it. He read it to us.",
        "Q: And what was the its impact?",
        "A: On us?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Devastating and confirming. It confirmed us in our desire, because I wasn't the only one\nwho felt this frustrated and who wanted to get out there and try to wake up -- so we were\ngetting confirmation to our own personal feelings from him. And I think that if he felt\nthat he was failing to arouse the street. He was succeeding in arousing us. That was, I\nthink, the greater of two contributions which he made. And we were champing at the bit.\nAnd so many of us in those classes spent the one year which the Army required for you\nto go and be an intern, that is by medical metaphor. You graduated medical school, now\nbe an intern in the hospital for a year, and then we will take you into the Army and we'll\ncommission you as a medical officer. The same with clergymen., go out, get your\ncongregational experience, what good that was going to do you in the Army I have no\nidea, but that was their bureaucracy. And so each of us was impatient to get out, get the\ncongregational job, spend the year and then get into the chaplaincy.",
        "Q: Let me focus for a moment on the Riegner telegram. Do you remember when you heard\nthe Riegner telegram --",
        "A: Well, it was in '42.",
        "Q: -- August of '42?",
        "A: Aug. '42. I didn't remember which month exactly. Well, so then it would have been a\nweek or two weeks thereafter. Remember I said school was continuous, there were no\nsummer vacations. So let's call it -- yes, it was before Rosh Hashanah. Yes I remember it\nnow. So I can't tell you the exact date, but we all used it in sermons that we made. I used\nit. remember I used it. But who was listening to us. I mean we didn't make any ripples.\nStudents make any ripples out in the big world. And if you were a student-Raggi at --\nwhere was I? It was a place in Virginia. So you're talking to one group of people and\nyou're reading this telegram to them and you're saying wake up, wake up. The impact was\nquite limited, quite personal. And, you know, the Riegner telegram of 1942 became such\na big sensation later as proof that we had evidence and everybody chose to bury it.\nWyman in his book talks about the fact that the State Department didn't want it\ntransmitted to anybody, they wanted it just kept secret. They were afraid of what impact\nit would make and so indeed it didn't make any for a long time. But Wise had it. We his\nstudents had it. We tried to get it out. I don't know when it hit the press.",
        "Q: How did Wise see his own role?",
        "A: I don't think he stood still long enough to see his own role. He was in constant motion.\nHe was in furious motion. And the fact that he would meet us every Thursday morning at\n11:00 o'clock week after week after week, year after year meant that that was a holy\nmoment for him, a crucial moment. If you can transmit something to your students then\nat least your mortality becomes less important. If you can't transmit anything to anybody\nand it's all bottled up in you, then it's dreadful that you are going to die with that. But he\nnever had a sense of dying. He was vigorous and always moving, speaking out ....Listen,\nhe was the prime spokesman to the non Jewish world not just to the Jewish world. In the\nfirst half of the 20th century every clergyman in this country knew the name of Stephen\nWise. And so his satisfactions came from that. Toward the end he developed cancer in\nthe throat and died in '49 never having set foot on the sovereign soil of the State of Israel.\nAt the very end I remember seeing him once and he said that was the greatest tragedy of\nhis life. He spent his whole life working for the cause of Zionism and when it reached its\nfruition he never had the joy and the glory of setting foot on that soil.",
        "Q: Let's go back to '42.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You then finished -- this was the Jewish Institute of Religion?",
        "A: Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. Later after he died in Cincinnati, I think it was\nstill Nelson Glick who was the president out there, came and pushed for the merger.\nSome of us fought against the merger. We had a different conception of what the reform\nmovement was then they did. Rabbi Morton Berman of Chicago, I remember, and Rabbi\nPhilip Bernstein of Rochester, those were two of my very close friends. They were a few\nyears ahead of me, a few years older than I was, but still we became very friendly. We\nfought the merger unsuccessfully, because Wise dead and no fund-raising -- he was the\nprime fund-raiser, he kept it going. So the merger took place. We scattered. I left. I was\ngraduated and went out to Denver in '43. Wise said to me, you go to Denver. Wise used\nto think that if he could place a man in a pulpit somewhere that he would then have a\nright to go to that man and to do some fund-raising in that congregation in support of the\nalma mater, the school you went to. So he was always desperately seeking good\ncongregational placements. Well, this was a congregation out there that had a thousand\nfamily memberships in 1943. The congregation was older than the State of Colorado.\nColorado came into the Union in 1876. Centennial State, that's the name of the book\nCentennial that what's his name wrote, Michener. The congregation was 1874. It was\nstarted by Simon Guggenheim, later Senator Guggenheim, American Mining and\nSmelting Company, a powerful, big German classical reform (Temple). So Wise pushed\nme as, I guess one of his favorite sons, into that congregation. Stay there and we'll always\nthen have a foot in the door.",
        "Q: You went out to Denver, what happened then?",
        "A: Well, I had a lovely year there, fighting hard with the congregation. Their previous rabbi,\nalso named Friedman, had been there for 50 years and taught then anti-Zionism, anti-\nHebrew, anti-Bar Mitzvah, anti-Oriental ceremonials like putting on a hat, etcetera,\netcetera. 50 years, two generations, I couldn't dream of upsetting that in one year, but I\ngot close to it, split the congregation. I said why don't you guys go off and be\nhomogeneous in your anti-Zionism, I'm going to take this congregation and turn it\naround. So you're going to be listening to stuff that's going to irritate you, and your\npresence out there in front 1s going to irritate me, so take a Safer Torah and goodbye.\nToday Denver has two big, big strong reform temples. The anti group has long since\ncome back. So I think I did a good thing. That was the year. And then I went to the\nArmy.",
        "Q: Let's talk for a little bit about the American Jewish Community at that point from the\nvantage point of Denver. You've already mentioned one division between Zionism and\nnon Zionism.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you've mentioned a second division between an activism that Wise was pushing for\nin a much more conservative posture of don't rock the boat or something like that. How\ndid you experience the division of the Denver Jewish Community during the year 1943\nwhich after all was the height of the holocaust?",
        "A: I'm not sure what you mean by how did I experience the division. I exacerbated the\ndivision inside the temple by splitting it. And on the basis of this ideological definition of\nZionism as being compatible with reformed Judaism, '43 was the crucial year in which\nthe Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a vote on the resolution \"Is reform\nJudaism compatible with Zionism.\" That's the way the resolution was framed and the\nvotes were taken, role call vote name by name by name by name. You had to stand up, it\nwas not a secret ballot. The vote was three to one in favor of that resolution. Yes, these\ntwo ideologies are perfectly compatible, three to one, 300 to 100. And the 100 guys went\noff and formed the American Council for Judaism, the anti-Zionist organization. The 300\nguys controlled the future growth of the reform movement. But it wasn't only on the\nZionist issue, it was on the issue of ritual. What is a Bar Mitzvah? What a silly, stupid\nthing. That boy isn't a man at the age of 13. We do not have Bar Mitzvahs. Well, and that\nwas the practice out in Cincinnati. That's the way those graduates were being taught. Our\ngraduates were pushing greater ritual observance, so we were accused of being Orthodox.\nWell, on order to validate that accusation which I thought was the ironic way to handle\nthe whole thing, my best friend in town was a Rabbi Manuel Lederman who was the\nOrthodox rabbi in town. It used to delight my supporters when they would see the two of\nus walking down the street together. It used to infuriate my enemies and gave them\nvisible proof that I was a traitor to the reform movement. We were friends all our lives.\nAnd his son, Paul, who lives in Jerusalem now, I still see once in a while.",
        "Q: In Denver was there a move for political activism at that point on behalf of the European\nJews?",
        "A: No, there was a move on behalf of Zionism. You know the accusation which is made\nagainst Ben Gurion himself and all the Palestinian-centered Zionist officials, that they\ndidn't pay much attention to the holocaust, they didn't express their outrage at it, they\ndidn't do very much except the Haganah, the military arm of the Jewish agency which\ntried to do something about it because, and these are the theories, because the Zionist\nleaders felt that the battle over saving Jewish life in Europe was lost, but that the battle\nfor creating a state which would harbor whoever would be left alive had yet to be won.\nSo of the two battles, why fight the one which is already hopeless, you must fight the one\nwhich contains the hope for the future. Now that was pretty much Ben Gurion's\nphilosophy. We talked about it many times and he wasn't cold, he wasn't calloused, his\nheart was as wounded as everybody's was, but he was a terribly practical and pragmatic\nperson. And so he said I've got to concentrate on Zionism and building the state. I want a\nJewish army. He was fighting for that as part of the Allied armies in order to stake a\nclaim afterwards to be able to sit at the peace table.",
        "Q: Which period of time did you first meet Ben Gurion?",
        "A: Well, I first met him in Paris in '45. So in '43 I didn't yet know him, but I knew the\nZionist concept that concentrated instead on trying to persuade the as yet unconvinced\nAmerican Jewish public that that's where the future lie. 1943 was only a year after the\nBiltmore Resolution was passed. The Zionists themselves never dared use the word\n\"state\" until 1942. They were also groping their way toward the definition of their own\nmovement. Courage finally prevailed. Again, Ben Gurion at the Biltmore Hotel, that's the\nname from which the resolution was drawn, had a big conference there. Ben Gurion\nstood up and said we must pass a resolution that we are trying to create a country, a state.\nThis was quite revolutionary in '42. In '43 in Denver we're all arguing about that. And I\nwas preaching sermon after sermon about state and army, army and state, independence\nand sovereignty, these are the only answers to powerlessness. We're powerless without\nthem.",
        "Q: And why did you decide to leave Denver and join the Army?",
        "A: Well because the fight was there. I mean the point is that I could continue trying to argue\nwith these Jews in Denver, and I made tremendous strides with them and I knew I would\nwin the fight or history would win the fight, not I, but I wanted to be where the history\nwas. So 365 days to the day, like the prisoner scratches the nail on the cement wall of the\ncell when the calendar -- and my old friend Rabbi Bernstein, Phil Bernstein, was the\nExecutive Secretary of the Chaplaincy Commission of the Jewish Welfare Board, which\ncertified to the Army that this rabbi yes indeed is sane and etcetera and we recommend\nthat you take him and commission him First Lieutenant. I think it was $1,000.00 a month.\nThat was better than the $25.00, which was the last offer I had.",
        "Q: That was $1,000.00 a month?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: $12,000.00 a year?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: In '45?",
        "A: Sure. What do you think I was being paid in the congregation? $75.00 a week, $75.00 a\nweek, $3,600.00 a year. So Army pay was fabulous, it was great. $3,600.00 a year. The\nArmy was the Mecca. And then you go through the process. You go to a chaplaincy\nschool in Fort Devens? in Massachusetts. You go to an infantry training regiment in\nCamp Blanding in Florida. And then you are assigned -- I was assigned as an infantry\nchaplain and you get -- we sailed from Boston and were put into a replacement depot up\nin Belgium in a little town called Namur. And then you get assigned to a regiment. I was\nassigned to the 9th Infantry Division which was part of the Third Army which was\nGeneral Patton. They were fighting over in Germany. We were in this depot in Belgium.\nSo then I was in already and feeling less strange about a uniform and saluting and\nshooting and all that stuff.",
        "Q: This was when?",
        "A: '45, spring of '45. I mentioned Namur. I have to tell you a story. This was a small town in\nBelgium and we are in a big camp outside of town and thousands of officers being\nshuffled around and it's paperwork and that takes (x) number of weeks before everybody\ngets sorted out. So one day I was walking through this little village, hardly more than a\nvillage, and I see a store front with a Magen David on the window.",
        "Q: Jewish star?",
        "A: Yes. A Star of David, yes. Well, okay, wow, what's this! I went past it a number of times\nuntil one day I saw that it was open and there were people inside. I walked in and in the\nsecond room, in the back and not visible to the street, I realized that this was a\nsynagogue. There was a little Ark and over the Ark there was a picture of a catholic priest\nwith a collar and no name, no designation. So I found one old man there who was sort of\nthe caretaker and he told me the story. What are you doing over the Holy Ark, this\ncatholic priest? Well, his name is Father Andre and we respect him because he saved so\nmany Jewish lives, and the story pours out. The Gestapo headquarters in Namur was in a\nbuilding that was right next to the church, and in the back of the church was where the\npriest was living and he had his bedroom and he had a kitchen, and the Gestapo officers,\nmany of whom are catholic, half the population of Germany, many of whom used to\ncome to sit and drink wine with the priest. And the priest figured that his bedroom next\ndoor to this kitchen was the safest place to hide Jews. And he was one on the network of\nan underground railroad that was passing Jews through town trying to get them -- the\nultimate safest destination was Portugal, neutral country, so it was always moving south.\nTwo Jews, four Jews in his bed, under his bed, in the big wardrobe. Four Gestapo\nofficers, five meters, ten feet away. Risky! I mean the material that movie pictures are\nmade out of. Not a single Jew was caught. Crazy things would happen. Four kids would\nshow up at the back door. He had to excuse himself, run, take them, push them under the\nbed, go back to the Gestapo guys. Never a problem, never a failure, never a death.\nHundreds of Jews were saved going through his bedroom. When it was all over they\ndecided they wanted -- the few remaining Jews wanted to give him a present so they\nbought him a new bed to replace his bed which had gotten so badly smashed in, which he\nhad never slept for two years. And put his picture up over the Ark. And that was the first\ntime I ever learned about \"Haside1 Umoth Ha'olam,\" the righteous Gentiles of the world.\nAnd more and more today we're beginning to hear about them, and he was one.",
        "Q: What did you know of the Holocaust in '43, '44, '45?",
        "A: Auschwitz was at its height in '44 and '45. Treblinka, '43 after the ghetto, that was the end\nof it, so Treblinka was at its height '42, '43. Sobibor, Etc., all of them. '43, '44, '45, they\nwere at the height of production. So when you say what did I know about it, I knew those\nfacts. I knew the facts that the Americans had refused and the British had refused\nbombing Auschwitz even though both Air Forces were over-flying the Ploesti oil fields\nin Rumania which were about ten minutes of flying time away from Auschwitz. And they\nwere using the excuse that they did not want to jeopardize Allied equipment and\nmanpower. But it was an excuse, they were already flying past Ploesti, they could have.\nThis just increased the sense of powerlessness. We can't convince anybody so we're\ngoing to have to do this ourselves. And the \"this\" has to be a firm determination to get the\nstate and get back into a situation of power over our own destiny. But there was nothing\nthat could be done about it.",
        "Q: You were a chaplain, when did you first encounter the survivors of the Holocaust?",
        "A: Dachau was liberated. I say Dachau because the division that I was with was down in\nsouthern Germany and we were at that time posted over in a little down called\nWasserburg am Inn which was between Munich and Saltzburg. Dachau was right outside\nof Munich. Dachau was liberated by the 42nd Division, I would say about May of '45,\nokay.",
        "Q: April 29th.",
        "A: April 29th, okay. It's good to have a real expert here. Now, the first encounter I had with\nrefugees was shortly thereafter, some matter of days or weeks. From Munich south, all\nthrough Bavaria were a whole network of underground German factories that were\nproducing goods for the Army, everything from simple bullets to very complicated\nHowitzers. It was all done with slave labor. These people emerged. They were wondering\naround the roads and forests and the lakes. It's heavily wooded area, and heavily\ninfiltrated with lots of small lakes. I used to take trucks out of the motor pool, 9th\nDivision motor pool and start driving on these small country roads looking for people and\ndetermining that they were Jews. The process is very simple, you just drop their trousers\nand that's that. And putting them into the trucks and trying to find a place where I could\ngather them and (a) let them be safe, and (b) get some food in and get some DDT powder\nand get some simple medicines. Penicillin had just been invented but it was ferociously\nexpensive and available only for syphilis. That's when I first encountered them. And I\nremember an episode where we were driving down and we had about a half a load of\npeople and we saw two children on the side of the road, this just remains locked in my\nhead, and I jumped out and I wanted to talk to the children. You talk to them in a\ncombination of German or Yiddish or Hebrew. You find one of those three languages\nwould work. But the kids were frightened. They saw a soldier in a uniform and they\nstarted to run across the field and it's a little boy and a little girl, and they're holding\nhands and they're running and they're stumbling. And I didn't want to threaten them by\nrunning faster than they were, so I kind of followed them and they were gasping and they\nwere crying, and finally they ran out of steam and they stopped, and so I stopped. After I\ngot my arms around them and I tried to explain to them and I pointed to the chaplain's\ninsignia on the uniform which was a little Ten Commandments thing and they quieted\ndown. I scooped up the two kids, they were about 10 or 11 years old, and I scooped up\nthe kids and put them in the truck. But the fear was so palpable. And whatever experience\nthey had been through was so utterly real that they were shocked out of any knowledge of\ntheir own names, where they came from, what they were doing there. I mean it was like\ntotal amnesia. And there was obviously already a medical condition; they could not\nremember their own names. It was the anonymity of those two survivors, they didn't\nknow who they were, what happened to them, where they came from that really impacted\nme. Because I don't understand the six million and I don't understand the one and a half\nmillion children or whatever the number is, but two children that's real, that's real. And I\nsaid to myself, every single one such we have to try to save and rescue. What's dead 1s\ndead. It's all gone. It's ashes, and it's blown off in the wind. But what's living we can't\nleave them wondering around Europe. And that's what I did for the next two and a half\nyears. So I still remember it. So that was the first encounter. And when you would get a\ntruck full of 50 people, then the trick is to find some structure with four walls and a roof.\nSo I remember once we would find a barn that had three walls, and you would find an\nabandoned airfield with a hangar. You would find something. I remember once I found a\ncity hall in a small German town. It was a beautiful building in perfect shape, fully\noccupied by German clerks, all busy working at the typewriters, and I said hey this is a\ngreat building. Well, a Colt .45 is a heavy piece of equipment. You turn it around and hit\nthe butt on the table and you can break the table. So a few knocks like that got the\nattention of the Burgermeister. It was a city hall so he's there, upstairs, second floor. And\nin nice German I told him this house was now beschlagnamt, this was requisitioned in the\nname of the United States Army. I had no more authority to do that than you do, than you\nwould have, but the uniform was its own authority and the .45 was it's own authority. So\nthat, okay, I want this place empty and I want it \"sauber\" and clean and I want it ready\ntomorrow morning and everybody out I am bringing in some \"Fluechtlinge,\" refugees. He\ndoesn't have to know who they are. And, you know, sure enough tomorrow morning it\nwas clean, it was empty, it was available, it was warm. He had some wood in the back for\na wood stove, and 50 Jews had -- now, this is called a camp. I mean you've got to\ndesignate it. You've got a location for it, you give it a name, it's got a population. And to\ncut a long story short by the time we got all through there were 64 locations in Germany,\nanother six or eight in Austria, and even two in Italy, all where the American Army was\nhousing quarter of a million people. The starting number that I was aware of when\nDachau was liberated, that were a few months earlier, was 35,000 Jews alive on German\nsoil either in camp, liberated from camps or from slave labor in German factories,\n35,000. That number was determined by a fellow named Abraham Klausner, a chaplain\nwho was with the forces that got into Dachau right after the camp was liberated.",
        "Q: You used the word \"we,\" who 1s we? So far you've only described operating really on\nyour own intuition.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When did it get organized?",
        "A: Okay. It got organized somewhere in a higher echelon unbeknownst to me, probably\nthree or four years earlier because the Haganah organized it and it was called Aliyah Bet.\nAliyah Bet meant --",
        "Q: Haganah was?",
        "A: Haganah was the military arm of the Jewish Agency, underground Jewish self-\ngovernment while the British are in mandatory control of the country. So you have an\nunderground government administering the affairs of the population, 600,000 Jews in the\nYishuv, and that underground government had an underground army. And at its height\nthe Haganah had about 25,000 men and women. Just so you should compare it to the\nother two underground organizations, the Irgun which was Begin's organization had\nabout 3,000 people, and the Stern Gang, which was Shamir's organization had about 300\npeople, so that gives you a scale. Now, the Haganah organized two departments to work\noutside of Palestine. One was called Aliyah Bet, which obviously is different what what,\nfrom Aliyah Aleph. Aliyah means migration to Israel or Palestine. Aleph is number 1,\nBet is number 2. Number | is legitimate, legal. It's what the British permitted. The British\npermitted 1,500 Jews per month to receive certificates to enter Palestine. Well, at 1,500 a\nmonth we were going to be many, many, many decades cleaning up what the remnant\nwas in Europe. Therefore Aliyah Bet, method number 2, illegal, was somebody going\ninto Europe, organizing groups of people, sending ships 1n to try to take these people to\nPalestine against the wishes of the British or anybody else who might try to stop them,\nincluding the Nazis. They started earlier in the game. They were taking ships out of\nRumanian port, for instance Constanza on the Black Sea, in '41, in '42. These were efforts\nthat were so desperate and so futile, a few hundred here, a few hundred there, and so sad\nin the ending, many of those ships sunk, many of the people drowned. So that was the\nstart of the whole thing. But when the war ended in '45 the Haganah guys came in to\nEurope in what was for them force, maybe as many as 100, and it might have been 150,\nI'm never sure of the whole number, and they recruited me. That's the \"we.\"",
        "Q: Well, how did they recruit you?",
        "A: Oh, it's a crazy story. I was in a little town down in Bavaria called Bad Tolz and the\ntelephone rings and there is a lady on the phone, and I was 27 years old, unmarried, and\nthis lady invites me to come to see her in her hotel room in the Royal Monceau Hotel in\nParis. So wouldn't you go, I mean under those conditions? When we finally met face to\nface I was quickly disabused of all such ulterior motives on my part and we got back to\ngood old idealism. She said that she had heard what I was doing and she wanted me to\ncome to meet her and she wanted me to -- she wanted to talk to me. That was the phone\nconversation. I agreed. I got orders and went a few days later. The British flag was\nhanging from the front of that hotel. It was right near the Etoile, Avenue Foch. What's the\nBritish flag doing on this hotel? She answers the door, she keeps me waiting out in the\nhall. She says will you work for us. So your question \"we.\" Will you work for us. Who is\nus? She says the Haganah. Now, sometimes in life you make decisions on the basis of\ncareful evaluation of all the fact involved. There were no facts here and you operated by\nintuition. And something told me to say yes and I said yes and it changed my life. She\nkind of went across the room, I'm still out in the hall, but I can see she goes to the door at\nthe far end of the living room. A short white-haired man comes out, walks across. She\nsays to him, Friedman will work for us. He comes over, shakes hands with me, says thank\nyou, turns around and walked out, and I didn't see him for a year. Aside from the fact that\nI didn't know who he was at the moment. So then she said that's Mr. David Ben Gurion,\nand I said who's he. I didn't connect in my mind that this was the Ben Gurion who is the\nhead of the Jewish Agency. He's supposed to be in Jerusalem or in jail in Rhodesia\nsomewhere where they scooped up everybody when the British did that Black Shabbat.\nNo, no she says, that's Mr. Ben Gurion. I said what's he doing here in the British hotel?\nSo she said you never read Poe. The purloined letter is right under your nose, and that's\nthe safest place to put it. Beautiful. So then I sat down and I said okay, and she gave me a\ncup of coffee and I took off my coat, and what have I committed myself to? Okay, well\nwhat you were doing down in the woods in southern Bavaria is fine, that's one thing, but\nwe heed you, you've got to go to Berlin, you've got to get yourself settled there. You get a\nbig house, you get six trucks in the backyard, you get enough gas tickets for a year,\nyou're going to run the route from Stettin up on the Polish border, north almost up to the\nBaltic, way northeast of Berlin, Stettin down to Berlin. I said that's all Russian territory.\nBerlin is an island in the middle of the Russian zone of Germany. She said that's right. I\nsaid we're going to run trucks for 150 miles through the Russian zone, across the Polish-\nRussian border, come down through the Russian zone to Berlin. She said that's it, that's\nwhat you're going to do. I said that's what I'm going to do. She said well, we'll send over\nsome Chayalim, some soldiers from the Palestine Brigade who are on bivouac over in\nBelgium. The British didn't want them to go back to Palestine. These were 30,000 guys,\nwell armed and well experienced in infantry warfare, which by no means did the British\nwant to have in Palestine. So they were keeping them there in Belgium doing nothing. So\nwe'll send you 12 fellows and they'll ride the trucks with you back and forth.",
        "Q: Let me see if I understand this for a moment. You are at this point a soldier in the United\nStates Army?",
        "A: A captain in the United States Army, yes sir.",
        "Q: So how do you move to Berlin and what do you do?",
        "A: Well, I said to her -- she said I don't care how you do it, it's not my business, you get\nyourself transferred to Berlin. If you don't know any of the ropes of your own Army by\nnow then what good are you going to be to us. I mean she was sort of mocking even. She\nsaid don't bother me with these details. I had to get myself transferred to Berlin\nHeadquarters Command. There was one stroke of luck. There was a guy occupying that\npost who was ready to be de-mobilized and go home. His name was Joseph Shubo, an\nOrthodox Rabbi from Boston. And Joe Shubo was just leaving, so I put in an application\nto take his place because we didn't need a chaplain in the 9th Infantry Division anymore,\nwe needed somebody up in Berlin Headquarters Command. The personnel department\nbought it, okay. So I was officially transferred to Berlin. Now, as far as a house is\nconcerned, we found in Dahlem in a very lovely residential section of Berlin a nice big\nhouse relatively undestroyed. The big holes in the roof, we got them repaired. One whole\nback wall knocked out, we fixed it up. This is easy, you know. You pick up craftsmen\nand bricks and cement all inside your own Army headquarters. And I stole the trucks\nfrom the motor pool, that's relatively easy if you want to take the risk. And I stole the gas\ntickets, that's easy if you want to take the risk. And I called her in Paris and I said okay\nsend -- so the Chevrah came over and they lived in the house. It was called the Jewish\nChaplain's Center. On the military side there were 2,000 Jewish troops in the city of\nBerlin in four armies.",
        "Q: The American, the British, the French?",
        "A: American, British, French, Russian. Did you ever see that old movie \"Four Men in a\nJeep?\" The patrolling of the city was done with the four soldiers of the four Allied\nArmies. It was called the Allierte Kommandatur, the Allied Command. Okay, and the\nreason we knew what there was because when the Sader came now, the first Sader after\nfreedom was in 1946, Passover, so we started to prepare for it, we wound up having\n2,000 guys in the Schoeneberg Rathaus for Seder, the first Seder in freedom. The same\nbuilding from which Kennedy once came and spoke from the balcony, \"Ich Bin ein\nBerliner,\" \"I'm a Berliner,\" he was sympathizing with the German population. That was\nthe same hall in which we had the Seder. And so there was a big group of troops from\nwhom to draw what I needed which was cigarettes. That's why we called it the Jewish\nChaplain's Center for the Allied Command of Berlin. It wasn't just the Americans.",
        "Q: These soldiers, your groups that you were able to draw from clearly cooperated. How did\nJewish soldiers feel being in Germany, what was going through the minds of some of the\npeople you were dealing with on a professional basis in the military life?",
        "A: Well, you know, how do they feel about being in Germany? Those who were consciously\nJewish, and that was not all of them by any means, you'd be surprised. Even, you know,\nwe talk about assimilation today, 1992, let me tell you something, assimilation was\nalready beginning to take its toll in 1945. People who were not denying that they were\nJews, but not consciously caring Jews. They didn't have any feeling. See, Germans to\nthem were the enemy. Nazis were the enemy. Germans were exploitable. A carton of\ncigarettes would buy you a Leica camera. A carton of cigarettes cost 70 cents in the PX,\nno tax.",
        "Q: What about the Jews who were consciously Jews?",
        "A: Oh, so they were distraught and they were upset. They knew because the Army\nnewspaper Stars and Stripes was printing the whole story of all the revelations.\nEisenhower visited the camp with his chief of staff, Walter Biddle Smith, that's on the\nfront page of Stars and Stripes. And Eisenhower says this is shocking and this 1s awful,\nand there is a long story on the front page, and a long story inside. And the guys who\ncared read those stories and they were constantly in the Army indoctrination lectures that\nthey listened to once every week. They heard everything, they knew it. And the ones who\ncared were distraught. And I used to try to, again do what I did all the time, turn their\nthinking away from the negative and on to the positive because they didn't yet make the\nconnection. And I found that the way that you got them to understand was to demand\nsomething of them. If you don't demand anything of people they don't respond. Nobody\nlines up in the window, at the window, to volunteer. When you do demand, when you ask\npeople suddenly realize there's a sense of discipline somewhere. Somewhere somebody is\nplanning something and needs your help. And that always evokes a response.",
        "Q: Let's use this perfect to break and change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: They recruited some people from left field.",
        "A: Well, I'm glad you're here.",
        "Q: That's why I pushed on the Riegner thing and on the Wise thing.",
        "A: No, good, good, good.",
        "Q: Because now we have -- I mean I already see how it's usable.",
        "A: Wonderful.",
        "Q: So we'll go with that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let me just catch you up before we begin. Yes, okay, let's catch up for one second. We're\ntalking about now your double life, you were demanding things of the troops.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did you demand of them?",
        "A: Of the troops?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The specific thing that I needed in order to keep that operation going, the operation of\nbringing people in from Stettin down to Berlin, the specific thing I needed was cigarettes.\nCigarettes was the currency of the black market, 1t was the currency of choice. A package\nof cigarettes was worth $15.00. A carton, ten packs, worth $150.00.",
        "Q: And you were buying it for what?",
        "A: I wasn't buying it. How would you possibly buy it? That's what it was worth. If you paid\n60 or 70 cents in the PX for a carton of cigarettes and you could sell it for $150.00, and I\ncame along and I said to you \"Soldier, I need a carton of cigarettes,\" it costs me one\ncarton per Jew. Now, I'm running six trucks every night, 50 people on a truck, that's 300\npeople.",
        "Q: You sold this to soldiers?",
        "A: Certainly. To the ones who cared. I got 300 people a night. I've got to pay 100, 300\ncartons of cigarettes, $150.00 a carton, that should be that's $45,000.00 worth of\ncigarettes every single night, every single night. We used to leave Berlin at dusk. It took\nabout until midnight to get up to Stettin, that 150 miles. We loaded in about ten minutes.\nThe Haganah guys on the Polish side of the line had their people all ready, 300 people. If\nwe had 320 we took 320. If we had to throw away the baggage, the poor crumbling\npieces, suitcase, a valise, that mostly had 1n it things like photographs, diaries, what did\nyou carry? You didn't carry an extra pair of socks or underwear. We used to throw the\nbaggage overboard to get three more people on. Kind of ruthless. And then leaving there\nat about midnight, getting back into Berlin by dawn, so this was an operation that took\nplace at night totally. I said now this is what I need, and so you've got to give me a carton\nof cigarettes. I've got to get 300 cartons a night prepared. I need thousands of cartons of\ncigarettes. So if the guy paid 70 cents for it, but he was giving me $150.00 because if he\ntook and he sold that on the black market even for currency, not for a Leica, a set of\nchina, he sold it for currency, occupation Marks, go right over to the Army post office,\nbuy a money order in U.S. Dollars, send that money order home to his wife or his mother\nor whatever to put it in the bank for him, every single week if he didn't smoke he was\nsaving $150.00. So for him to give that to me was an authentic large gift. My father used\nto send me thousands of cartons of cigarettes a week which he collected from his shul,\nfrom B'nai Jacob up in New Haven. And I had the postal inspectors on my doorstep at the\nChaplain's Center because this 1s cash and they want to know what are you doing with it,\nChaplain. And I'd say if you guys find me doing anything illegal with it then you arrest\nme. Until that time do me a favor and don't worry about it. Well, you know there's a\ncertain power of the cloth, you know, that works, and so I took advantage of it.",
        "Q: Clearly people knew about it?",
        "A: I didn't get the question?",
        "Q: Clearly people knew, people knew what you were doing.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: You couldn't keep an operation like this concealed.",
        "A: No, no, no. And I always adopted the -- General Barker was the commanding officer in\nthe Berlin Headquarters Command, American General. I told him. I always adopted the\npolicy of telling the top echelon, the very top of any given Army unit, because if the guy\nat the top knows and if he decides to be mean about it, he can shut you down. And if he\ndecides to be benevolent about it he just passes word down the line to leave you alone.\nAnd the Army is absolutely the most rigid hierarchy in the world and if you turn that to\nyour use.",
        "Q: Tell me about walking into the general and telling him you were working for an\nunderground organization to save Jewish lives?",
        "A: I never said underground. That word wasn't necessary.",
        "Q: Talk about the conversation, tell me about the conversation?",
        "A: Well, the conversation by the way was not only with him in Berlin, I'll jump ahead and\nsay later on down in Frankfurt it was with General McNarney who succeeded\nEisenhower, and it was with General Lucius Clay who succeeded McNarney. So all down\nthe line I always went to the top. How do you do it? General, you know about the\nproblem of what Hitler did to the Jews? Yes. You know about the fact that there is a\nremnant of refugees, wanderers, survivors here in Europe?",
        "Q: You were using the language roughly Jews. Were survivors introduced at that point?",
        "A: Sure, people who survived Hitler, people who survived Hitler. Every camp that was\nliberated. There were a lot of dead corpses around, but there were people who walked out\nof there alive and they survived. So we used the word then, sure. As a matter of fact I\nused to teach them the Hebrew \"She'erit Hapletah,\" the surviving remnant of the -- now,\nthese people want to go home. The General says yes, well all these displaced persons\nthey all got to go home. There were 10 million of them and the Army is repatriating all of\nthem. Right, General, the Army is repatriating all of them, but there is one group that the\nArmy doesn't know what to do with and that's the Jews because they have no home.\nThey're not going to go back to Poland. If you talk citizenship, that you're going to\nrepatriate people according to their citizenship, if it's a Belgium slave laborer or a French\nor a Norwegian or a Dane or anybody who has been conquered by the Nazis, held as a\nslave laborer you repatriate him back to his original home. Jews are not going back to\ntheir original homes, all of which are cemeteries. So the Army isn't going to repatriate\nJews to remain in Yugoslavia, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, where do all these\npeople want to go? So sometimes the Army guy knows enough to say well, I understand\nthey all want to go to Palestine. And if he doesn't know that he says, well where do they\nwant to go. So you tell him, and then you go off on the Zionist story. The American\nArmy didn't have any more sympathy for the British Army than Britains had for\nAmericans. So you painted the British as the bad guys who were trying to prevent these\npeople from going home, and you depict home as something that every Bible-loving\nAmerican, you're not talking to Jews, you are talking to Protestants largely and some\nCatholics. Catholics are mostly urban and not as well acquainted with the Bible, Biblical\nimpulse, as rural or small town Protestants. And so you've got his sympathy. I never once\nran into an inimical officer of high rank, never once. I've run into them on lower ranks\nwhere I'm not discussing anything with them, but I'm listening to kind of a, you know,\nsort of profane kind of vulgar anti-semitism, but I always discounted that, it didn't bother\nme.",
        "Q: So you tell them about the Jews want to go home?",
        "A: And therefore, and therefore we are collecting them. Who is we? Well, there's an\norganization of Palestinians that's collecting, collecting the means. They're moving from\neast. Don't forget that the Russians took hundreds of thousands of Jews eastward as the\nNazi armies moved eastward, okay. The Russians for their own reasons, not altruistic,\nthey're not pro-semitic, Stalin didn't love Jews, but this was maybe a half a million or to a\nmillion people whom he used as labor out beyond the Urals in Central Asia cutting\ntimber mostly, sending back railroad ties. Well, okay, the war is over. Three quarters of\nthem are dead of starvation and hunger and over-work, but there is a good chunk of\nhundreds of thousands. How can I have brought them from as far out as Tajikistan and\nUzbekistan and Turkestan, moving them westward, all the time westward toward where\nthe American Army was in Germany and in Austria. So I said there is an organization of\nPalestinians that is trying to round up these people and bring them together because if\nyou get them all collected someplace you can handle them easier. I mean that's a very\nclear approach to a mechanistically-minded Army General. That's how he thinks anyhow.\nSo I said now there is a whole -- they've come as far west as the border of Germany and a\nbunch of them are up in a town called Stettin, that's the collecting point, and at that point\nthese Palestinian guys can't come into the Russian zone of Germany or the American\nzone of Germany, so there are some of us here who are helping them. Now, if he wants to\nbe really very very GI, well are you doing this at the expense of your Army duties? No,\nsir. No, sir. I'm running my services, I've got 700, 800 guys coming every Friday night,\nevery Saturday morning. Why don't you come over, General, and you'll read the Torah\nportion of the week. And okay, okay, you keep doing a good job. So what are you telling\nme all this for? I said well, look I think you ought to know it because it's happening in\nyour command, in your territory for which you are responsible. There might come an\nepisode where the Russians will raise hell with a truckload of refugees, and you don't\nwant to be caught short not knowing what's going on. Right, good, thanks. I love a guy\nwho keeps me informed. Again, straight Army mentality. So, yes, and that policy always\npaid off. It paid off in hundreds of ways. It paid off with 2,000 calories per day from the\nArmy to every DP in every camp in Germany and Austria. And the JDC Joint\nDistribution Committee brought in supplementary rations of 1,200 so the DP who had\nbeen starved for years, the displaced person, is eating now 3,200 calories a day, great.\nMost of it Army food. And so every night we'd run up there and take our load and --",
        "Q: You would go with them every night?",
        "A: Oh, no. I couldn't go every night, but once a week. Because most of the time I was\nhustling for the cigarettes.",
        "Q: Who would be your drivers?",
        "A: The Palestinian guys, the Chayalim, with one driver and one guy running shotgun, so it's\ntwo fellows on each truck, so that's the 12. She said get six trucks. So I have six trucks\nand 12 guys and they were on every night. Every once in a while I get some really gung\nho American sergeant, Jewish guy, and he'd say hey I want to ride the truck. I'd say\nlisten, you know, it's your tachat, and I'm not going to translate that.",
        "Q: The exterior.",
        "A: Yes, your exterior, anything happens, buddy, I can't help you. So he'd come on board,\nyou know, with his carbine or his M-1 and he'd feel that he as doing -- and he was, he\nwas guarding 50 people. Our drivers, we had wonderful, wonderful cooperation from\nJewish guys in the Quartermaster pool. They were all good drivers. Enough good drivers\nso that it was a delight to have them. Well, you know, you run 300 people a night, a\nnight, a night, every night and well we ran almost 100,000 people through Berlin that\nway. But when you bring them in you've got a problem what do you do with them. And\nnot only how do you handle them, but you've got to get them out because Berlin is an\nisland don't forget. So that was all part of the game. We opened two camps in Berlin. One\nwas at Schlattensee out near Wannsee, southeastern part of the city, and one was at\nTemplehof Airdrome, right on the airfield. We had 10,000 people in the Schlattensee\ncamp and 5,000 people in the Templehof camp, so I had places for 15,000 people.",
        "Q: Where were you getting 300 cartons of cigarettes a night?",
        "A: I'm getting it from the Gls, I'm getting it from my father, but the bulk finally came in\nfrom the JDC. The first port in Europe that opened up where you could get massive\nshipments in --",
        "Q: The JDC is the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee?",
        "A: American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, that's a long name, but the short name is\n\"the Joint,\" the Joint. A marvelous organization, 75 or 85 years old. I don't know how old\nit is. It goes back to World War I. Brilliant professionalism. If I were asked to describe it\nin two words \"Brilliant professionalism.\" No ego gets in the way. No politics get in the\nway. Just plain what is the task, how shall we do it most efficiently and most cheaply,\nand don't use the excuse that you haven't got the money. Define the task, figure out the\nmethodology, figure out the cost and the UJA supplies the JDC with the money. And\nthere never was an insufficiency, there never was an argument.",
        "Q: So the Joint shipped in the cigarettes?",
        "A: Car loads, freight car loads. Then I was free. Antwerp opened up. The first port ships\ncame into Antwerp. Trains were already working through Belgium up to Bremerhaven.\nFrom Bremerhaven down to Berlin. And I got all the cigarettes I needed. And that's what\nkept it going. My improvisation was at the beginning. But when Antwerp opened and I\ngot in touch with the Joint and they immediately responded.",
        "Q: And they knew what you were doing?",
        "A: The director of the Joint was a fellow by the name of Schwartz, Doctor Joseph Schwartz,\nand he was working hand in glove with the Haganah who was paying for the whole\noperation. It wasn't just this one little bit of the cigarettes. If you had a hundred\nPalestinian guys, the Haganah back in Jerusalem didn't have any money. The Joint was\nfinancing that whole thing. Throwing 1,200 calories per person per day into the camps\nwas -- in the campaign the UJA campaign in the United States, of 1946, in 1947, more\nUJA money was being given to the Joint for use in the camps among this population than\nwas being given to the Jewish Agency for work in Palestine because the greater need was\nthere in Europe in those two years. By 1948 it shifted and the greater share of the money\nwas going to the Palestine operation, then Israel. So that was Berlin and that was the\ncamp at Schlattensee and that was the camp at Templehof, and then the trick always was\nto organize trainloads to go out of Berlin southward through the Russian zone and come\ndown to Frankfurt which was in the American zone, and go into one of the 64 permanent\ncamps that were in the American zone and there catch your breath and sort out whom you\nwanted to send further south to the Mediterranean to the French and Italian Riviera, both\nof them, where the Haganah ships came in to take the people who were willing to run the\nrisk of the British gauntlet and most of whom were caught out on the high seas in\ncontravention of international law, it didn't make any difference. And the people were put\nby the British on the island of Cyprus which became an end goal in itself because it's\nonly eight hours to Haifa. So the people are on Cyprus and the ship is being collected and\nlined up in the port of Haifa. Now, I never saw it with my own eyes, but I saw a\nphotograph, 57 vessels caught by the British lined up there. They were old tramp\nsteamers, Greek ships and Turkish ships.",
        "Q: How many of your colleagues, did you speak to other chaplains, were some of your\ncolleagues involved, did you do any recruiting for the Haganah yourself?",
        "A: No, I didn't do any recruiting. And the answer is yes I did speak. There were only a few.\nThere was a fellow who was for a long time a rabbi in this town, in Washington, Eugene\nLippman, a good guy. He was in on it with us. He worked over on the Czechoslovak\nborder, on what we call the southern route. Stettin, Berlin, was the northern route. The\nsouthern route was from a town in lower Silesia, part of Poland, across Nochood, across\nto a town called Klaus?? in Czechoslovakia, to Prague, all the way eastward over to\nabout Bratislava in Hungary, westward back to Vienna, Vienna to Munich. That was the\nsouthern route. Lippman worked the southern route. He was wonderful. Who else was?\nI've got a fellow by the name of Meyer Abramowitz, a conservative rabbi, now retired in\nMiami. He followed me in Berlin. We had closed the route down by then. He didn't have\nthat much to do, but he maintained a large camp population, and later on he moved down\nto Italy to work in camps for the JDC. Married his wife, a DP lady from a camp in Italy.\nSo Mike was in, Mike Abramowitz was in it. Eugene Lippman was in it. Klausner was in\nit at the beginning, not for long, but for a few months. There were another dozen men\nwhose names I don't remember who were demobilized, whom we re-recruited to come\nback because on that southern route, which I described, we wanted to put a chaplain on\nevery train of 1,000 people. A Jewish chaplain riding that train from Prague to Bratislava,\nto Vienna to Munich. All kinds of episodes occurred, all kinds of interferences, all kinds\nof problems, all kinds of strikes from the people themselves, personal problems. One\nauthoritative American Army officer on the train in uniform with his chaplain's insignia\nhad a very sobering effect and a very salutary. So we didn't have the manpower, and the\nArmy called back to active duty a dozen chaplains for a half year and we had the\nadvantage of their services on that southern route. So I have to say they helped. I don't\nremember names. The first three guys I remember very well and very clearly. No, I didn't\nrecruit because there was one, there were two fellows whose names | shall not mention\nwho when I told them that we could use their help and asked them if they wanted to\nparticipate, they gave me such a chicken answer, we are here to serve the Army and we're\nnot going to do anything else, we're not going to get mixes up in this business, this is\npolitical.",
        "Q: And you felt no incompatibility between your Army service and this work?",
        "A: No, it was a delightful synergy. It was wonderful. First of all it was good cover, and\nsecondly every time I involved Gls in this thing, I was teaching a bunch of Jews about\ntheir responsibility. Come on, it was great. What am I going to do, give them lectures\nabout VD. I mean or go visit in the stockade. I never was very good at that anyway.",
        "Q: Did you visit the DP camps themselves?",
        "A: Oh, come on. I was asked after the Berlin thing by a man whom I mentioned earlier, a\nrabbi by the name of Philip Bernstein who was a key figure. First he was the executive\ndirector, I told you, recruiting chaplains. All right, now we're not recruiting any more\nchaplains, but the commanding general in the German theatre beginning with Eisenhower\nhimself, realized that he had to have at his disposal a person of high stature in the Jewish\ncommunity to serve as his advisor on Jewish affairs. That was the bureaucratic name, title\nof the job. Because you're accumulating now thousands and thousands and thousands,\ntens of thousands of people, problems are going to develop, the Army commander says\nhey give me somebody here who can help me or without saying it, but on whom I can\ndump some of this stuff and I don't want to take the heat for it. I don't want to have the\nArmy get into an adversarial position with these DPs. So there was a consultative\narrangement agreed upon among five major Jewish organizations in the United States and\nthe Department of War that whomever they would designate as a candidate whom they\nall agreed upon, the Army would designate that person, give him the simulated rank of a\nTwo-Star General although he was a civilian and remained in civilian clothes, but for\npurposes of access in the Army Two-Star General puts him up there. You get two cartons\nof whiskey a month from the PX, and you get a certain kind of car, and you get a driver,\nand you can call up anybody and you can say this is advisor Bernstein calling and the\nfellow looks at the list and he sees advisor to General McNarney or General Clay, oh this\nis a two-star guy, well you know, I've got to listen to him. Bernstein was brilliant. The\nfirst advisor was a chaplain, a man by the name of Judah Nadich, a conservative rabbi in\nNew York. He remained with Eisenhower for about three months. Eisenhower went\nhome, Nadich went home, okay. That's when the Army decided it better institutionalize\nthis thing. Bernstein came and stayed, I don't know, a year and a half or something like\nthat. Bernstein gets assigned to Army Headquarters which are in Frankfurt in the IG\nFarben building, a great German industrial combine, huge, huge headquarters building.\nFrankfurt bombed to pieces and this building didn't have a window broken because this\nbuilding was designated prior and so informed the Air Force don't touch it. We've got to\nsave something for eventual Army headquarters, okay. Bernstein's office was two offices\naway from General Clay. I mean literally, couldn't be closer. Bernstein called me in\nBerlin and he said hey listen, I don't know anything about the Army, Major-General\nHeichmoten, that doesn't mean anything to me, I am entitled to a military aid, I need you,\nwill you come down to Frankfurt and be my military aid. And I said I will be happy to on\none condition, that he understood that I have Haganah responsibilities.",
        "Q: And you were able to say that directly over the phone and clearly?",
        "A: Well, all Army, at his level, all phones are what are called secure. They're constantly\ntested electronically for taps and you didn't have the kind of surveillance by satellite\nwhere today you listen to every long distance phone conversation in the entire world.\nNSA here listens to every single long distance phone conversation it wants to. If you\nwant to talk to your wife anywhere and you say you don't want your privacy invaded,\nthey say oh well we didn't invade your privacy, I mean the satellite was not working over\nyour district today. I mean let's not get into that. Technology wasn't advanced in those\ndays. So he said well I don't know what that means but, you know, come on down and\ntell me. So I came down because I really liked him. We were intellectually close and\nspiritually close, we were on the same wavelength. That guy was as Zionist as I was from\nthe day he was born. I came down and I explained it to him and he said well that's fine,\nI'm all in favor of that, just don't tell me about it. Because the theory always is if the\nsuperior officer doesn't know or it works on the principle of what's called \"The need to\nknow.\" Phil said, I have no need to know so don't tell me, so then I can't be guilty of\nmaking any mistakes and I won't have to lie or anything. Very good, good arrangement.\nBut anything that was to help Palestine or Israel or the cause was fine. And so, yes we\nwere in DP camps all the time. The DP population we decided should get itself with some\nkind of authoritative, authorized base. What does that mean? There was something in\nexistence which had gotten started right after the war called the Central Committee of\nLiberated Jews, and then there was a huge fight as to the preposition. Liberated Jews of\nGermany, Liberated Jews in Germany. Now, those two words tell the whole ideological\ndifference. So the fight raged and finally they settled on of course \"in Germany,\" right.\nCentral Conference [committee??] of Liberated Jews in Bavaria became broadened as the\ncamp population grew and grew to \"In Germany.\" We then arranged a ceremony in '46\nfor a charter of recognition to be granted by the United States Army to the Central\nCommittee. And the ceremony was held at Headquarters, Farben building with a half a\ndozen of the DPs who were the chief officers of the Central Committee and half a dozen\nMajor-Generals and so forth, and the photograph exists where General McNarney and\nRabbi Philip Bernstein are side by side signing the charter of recognition. Now, that\nmeant that the officials of the Central Committee could travel on Army vehicles, 1t meant\nthat they could -- quarter of a million Jews in the camps.\nAT THIS POINT THERE IS APP. 1 MINUTE OF INTERVIEW MISSING",
        "Q: Were you with Ben Gurion when he visited a DP camp?",
        "A: I took him into one camp, yes I was. He was on his way to the Ist Zionist Congress that\nwas being held after the war and he remembered me from the first episode even though I\ndidn't know him at that time. So again I got a call from Paris from his bodyguard, a\nfellow by the name of Mordechai Circus (Zirkes?), who said Mr. Ben Gurion wants to\ncome into Germany and will you get him the necessary pass etcetera, and he wants to\nvisit a camp and you decide where. We had had a very terrible episode at a camp called\nBabenhausen which was near Stuttgart. Let's say either Jews from the northern route or\nthe southern route a trainload of a thousand Jews comes in. And the trainload passed\nthrough Munich and comes up to Stuttgart and the train is on the track and their going to\nbe put in this camp. Now, what is this camp? It's a former Russian POW, prisoner of war,\ncamp maintained by the Nazi Army. As a prisoner of war camp the Nazis didn't care how\nthey treated the Russians so there were no beds, there were no bunks, there were concrete\nfloors with straw thrown on them, and totally encircled by a heavy chain link fence,\nbarbed wire, guard towers, machine guns, heavy search lights, the whole apparatus that\nlooked like a bloody extermination camp. I'll never forget it. The train comes around the\ncurve, many cars, freight cars, the same kind of freight cars that were used, a thousand\npeople on it. They've been on the train now three days. And they're being taken and they\nknow by now through the grapevine that a DP camp in Germany was a place where it\nwas not good, but if you had patience someday the problem was going to be solved, and\nif you kept your hope up. So they were not resisting the idea of going into a DP camp, but\nthey resisted the idea of going into this camp which looked to them like an extermination\ncamp. And the bloody officer who had been told to tear down the barbed wire, take down\nthe guard towers, get some cots in there or some mattresses, none of it had been done. It\nwas a typical bureaucratic slip-up, okay.",
        "Q: Not malice, just --",
        "A: No, not malice, just ineffectiveness. Sit down strike on the train. We're not going to get\noff these cars. And boy there were enough agitators among them who were exercising the\nright of freedom for the first time to talk about their own fate and they say we're not\ngetting off, and, it didn't take three minutes before that mood froze. And I was there, at a\nnew camp I like to see. When you asked the question before, I was in almost every one of\nthose camps all the time traveling, working for Bernstein out of the advisor's office in\nFrankfurt. I set up a microphone alongside the track and tried to talk to these people.\nNothing doing.",
        "Q: In what language, Yiddish?",
        "A: Yiddish. Yes, Yiddish. I learned German in high school and in college. By the time my\nparents were married English was the language in the house, by the time I was born. So I\ndidn't know any Yiddish, but I knew good German. And so every time I would appear\nbefore the DPs I would use German. One fine day an episode occurred which taught me a\nlesson. There was a little fellow sitting in the front row and he folds his arms like this and\nI can see he's annoyed. And I can hear him say in a low voice: \"Red nicht kain Deitsch\",\n\"Don't speak German.\" I keep speaking German. A little bit louder he says \"Ich forder a\nYiddish wort\", \"I'm demanding a word from you in Yiddish.\" I don't pay any attention to\nhim. Finally he stands up and he shouts :\"Oder Ihr red Yiddish , oder ich laeuf arois fun\ndannen\", he says \"Either you're going to talk Yiddish or I'm going to run out of here.\" So\nthat taught me a lesson. And I tried to twist my German around and ultimately I learned\nYiddish. So, yes, talk on the microphone to the people on the train in Yiddish and\nnothing doing, nothing is happening. General Keys, a Lieutenant-General, Three-Star\nCommander of the Third Army, Patton's successor, comes out to the track. Nobody will\never believe this story, speaks in English over the -- I translate for him, and they see all\nthe stars and all the fruit salad on the uniform and they know, you know, who he is, I've\ntold them who he is. It doesn't make the slightest -- they were polite but. Colonel Ed\nMartin, the Catholic Chief Chaplain of the Third Army, a full Colonel, comes out.\nNothing doing. Abe Heiman, a Major, the guy on our staff, the lawyer we had. The staff\nwas three of us, Phil Bernstein, Abe Heiman and myself, nothing doing. Okay, the first\nnight they sleep in the train. By the second day they're getting a little hungry. We pass\nfood up and down the train and bring out a whole bunch of Army field kitchens to feed\nthem. I mean that you could do with the snap of a finger. When the Army wants to\ncooperate it's easy. After enormous efforts in which they saw whole bunches of soldiers\ncoming out with wire cutters cutting the barbed wire off, knocking down the towers, they\nsaw it physically with their own eyes, and they realized they were not going into any kind\nof a trap, they dismounted from the train. That was the beginning of the camp. That is not\ndesigned to create good morale thereafter. That's the camp that I decided to take Ben\nGurion to. So I said, Zirkes, you want me to take Ben Gurion to one camp, I'm going to\ntake him to Babenhausen, but you have to tell him that that's a very problematic place.\nThe episode of the initial strike took place some months earlier, but the mood in the camp\nis still lousy, it never did get repaired. So okay, it's all right, the old man has been in\ntough situations before. We come in, there are about 5,000 people in the camp, there 1s no\nauditorium, there is no place for 5,000 people to sit, they're standing in what was the\nstable where the horses were kept, a big huge room like an airplane hangar. There's a\nmicrophone, there is a wooden platform. Abe Heiman and I climb up on the platform\nwith the old man and he stands there, and we introduce him. And there is a loud, cheerful,\nhappy welcome because he, you know, he was a figure. And the camp chairman came up\nand said we want to tell you how we feel and started to talk about the fact that life here is\nnot physically dangerous, but life here doesn't have any meaning, what are we doing\nhere? We are trying to teach the children in the school and we are trying to take care of\nthe sick people and we tried to build a life and we have now our own camp police. They\nhad bicycles and they had whistles and they had arm bands, they kept order. It was a sign\nof independence. We're doing everything we can, but it's all nothing. And so you're\ncoming here today brings us the greatest hope in the world and we hope you have\nsomething to tell us. He stood up and he started to talk about what he was trying to build\nin Palestine and what the efforts were that were being made on the great international\npolitical scene with the British and the Americans the Commission of Inquiry and\nsomebody else. \"Noch a mol a Commission\", another time a Commission of Inquiry, who\nneeds it. You know, we got a little heckling from the audience. But he tried to explain\nthat there was a major push on in historic terms to get a state created and a free\ngovernment to which they could come. But he wasn't going to offer them any immediate\npanacea, and he wasn't going to offer them any immediate results because he would be\nkidding them. He talked firmly, he talked beautifully, he talked honestly because that was\nhis strong, his forte. He wasn't a manipulative politician. He was an ideologue. He had\nhis own ideology, but he never tried to say anything to give people false illusions, false\nhopes. When he got through there was silence, no applause. And finally he said \"Listen, I\nhave no certificates in my pocket for you, don't you understand that? But I am telling you\nthat I do bring you hope. Now, let's sing the song of hope. I want to hear Hatikva.\" He\nhad a monotone and he couldn't sing. I have a monotone, I couldn't help him. The crowd\nslowly started kind of a crackling, crack, off key, but it began to build, it began to build\nsome momentum and then it came out into full burst and there was a big singing of\nHatikva by which time he was crying. And that was the end of the meeting and he walked\noff and he was shaking his head. And we got outside, got in the car, he said \"My God, I\ndon't know what's worse, people being burned up in the camps or people waiting 1n these\ncamps without hope. I don't know how to say which is worse.\" And then years later I read\nin his, you know, he wrote voluminously in his diaries, and I want to read here, I have\njust one paragraph, and I don't want to take his words. This is what he wrote \"The people\nof Babenhausen finally understood that their unloved camp was not the end of the line,\nbut a way station on the road to freedom. The distrust and bitterness I had faced that day\nin October gave way in December to patient hope.\" December was the Zionist Congress\nin Basel in 1946. So he sensed the mistrust, he sensed the bitterness, he sensed\neverything, he understood it, but he said he believes that he gave them hope that their\nstay there was a way station on the road, it was not the end of the road. And he and I for\nyears after that, we saw each other very often in the course of the whole UJA career and\nthe course of the years that I lived in Israel after that, and every once in a while he would\nget a glint in his eye and he would say let's talk about Babenhausen. Sort of a symbol to\nhim, the way station. So, yes, we used to go to visit lots of the camps and there were lots\nof problems and riots and Jews breaking out of camps.",
        "Q: When you look back on this period what do you see from the outside was happening to\nthe survivors in their journey? You mentioned hope.",
        "A: Yes, that's what we concentrated on. We tried to concentrate, we tried to build up a sense\nthat (a) there was a large group who cared, a group of institutions and individuals who\nand which cared for them, there was somebody caring for them, there was somebody\nlooking after their welfare, there was somebody trying to take care of their immediate\ndaily needs, and somebody trying to build a future for them. And that was the basic\nmessage and we reinforced it all the time by active conduct. The Jewish Agency would\ngive us a Singer or a piano player or somebody. I remember a lady, Paula Padaney, a\ngreat pianist, and put her on the circuit and send her through 30, 40, 50 camps, as much\ntime as she could give us. We did all kinds of things. The Agency sent over about a\nhundred school teachers. It grew even to more than that I think. And we put Palestinian\nschool teachers in the schools which were organized in each camp to keep the kids busy.\nYou did everything you could and you kept publicizing through the camp newspaper\nnetwork every time a ship would go so that -- there was a dreadful thing called the Va'ad\nAliya, the Committee on Immigration, I call it dreadful because it was operated according\nto the Zionist political key.",
        "Q: The Mafteach",
        "A: You know, okay. This Mafteach, the key. Depending on --",
        "Q: I don't want to be flip about it because our people listening to this are not going to. Tell\nus, and I'm being flip and it's a very important story. Let's go back and --",
        "A: And with every reason to be flip about it or to be more than sarcastic. I called it dreadful.\nIt was not a humane way of handling this, it was a purely political way. The committee\nhad on it representatives of every Zionist political party. The committee fought\nferociously that if a ship had room for 600 people each political party fought for its share\nof the 600 berths. No consideration of women and children first okay. That doesn't go\nanyway because you don't want to separate families. No consideration for family need. I\nmean we knew the populations in each camp so intimately. We never treated them as a\nmass, we always treated them as much individually as possible. So it would be very easy\nto know if there are 600 places, give us the 600 neediest people in camp A, or give us 100\npeople each from six different camps so you'll build a moral in six camps that indeed the\nships are going and maybe someday they'd get on a ship. There would be ways of doing\nit. No, the political key operated. Namely, each party argued what it's relative strength\nwas and demanded the number of berths on that ship according to its strength. My party\nis 13 percent of the Jewish people, I want 13 percent of the seats. If you ask him who he\ncares about, he didn't care about the individuals, give me 13 percent of the seats because\nwhen they get to Palestine they're going to be voters for his party because his party took\nhim out of Germany.",
        "Q: Let's go back for a moment, you say you knew the people intimately in that real sensing\ntheir needs. What were the needs?",
        "A: The needs were simply spiritual and non-material. They were psychological, spiritual and\npsychological. The people needed to believe that they would not be in these camps\nforever, that this wouldn't be the end, that there was a different end. Now, they knew that\nthey could always be repatriated back to their original land of citizenship. All they had to\ndo was say to the Army, hey, I'm Hungarian so send me back to Hungary. That's not what\nthey wanted. So they were waiting, waiting, waiting. Now, they're not hungry, they're not\nin danger, their medical needs are cared for, so what do they need? They need an\nuplifting of the spirit. They need belief and confidence that there would be a successful\nend.",
        "Q: Did they want to come to America?",
        "A: Well, there was always some number. And HIAS at that time, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid\nSociety, was responsible for taking to America those who wanted. And some small\nnumber went to America, but the number was really very small. I don't know how to\nquantify it. HIAS every once in a while, some every few months, there would be a ship\nand the trans-Atlantic vessels always had room for 1,200 people, 1,500 people. So I don't\nknow, if there was a ship a month you were talking about 15, 20,000 people per year\ncompared to the large number. I say I can't really quantify it, and I don't know if anybody\nhas got a statistic.",
        "Q: What of Palestine representatives?",
        "A: Oh, Palestine. Listen, Palestine, you talk about if you recite the Schmona Ezrei every\nday, if you do, then you're talking about rebuilding Zion and rebuilding Jerusalem. I\nmean it was bread into the bone from these people who came out of the small towns and\nvillages of Eastern Europe. And even the sophisticated ones from the bigger cities had\nsome memory of that tradition. I'm not saying that there was a lot of religiosity in formal\nsense of that word. Yes, there was a synagogue in every camp and there was a rabbi in\nevery camp, and he took care of second marriages which were very frequent, people who\nmarried during those three and a half years in the camps, but you're not talking about a\ndevout, you're talking about skeptics as far as religion is concerned. Belief in God, where\nwas he, and maybe, and you know. But the ethnic and the folk traditions, the memories of\nholidays and the memories of food and the memories of basic prayers. So they were all\noriented toward rebuilding Zion. If you recited the blessing after meals, in the blessing\nafter every meal, if you said it, 1s the \"Benei Yerushalayim\" etcetera, \"in our day\nquickly.\" So that was their orientation. I remember once there was a camp outside of\nFrankfurt called Saosheim and Eleanor Roosevelt came to visit. She stood up there and\nshe was trying, she was kind of a good rabbel rouser, she always could get the crowd to\nrespond to her. She thought that awakened the crowd out of any lethargy. That's the way\nshe explained it to me later. We became friendly. She said \"Perhaps you do not want to\ngo to Palestine, perhaps it takes too long, perhaps the British don't--perhaps you'll lose\nconfidence, you'll lose faith in it. Do you really want to go to Palestine?\" You know, the\nway the question was phrased was in order to evoke that massive roar. But she couldn't\nhave evoked it if they didn't feel it. They were almost homogeneously, almost\nunanimously zeroed in that that was the only future they had.",
        "Q: When did you leave Europe?",
        "A: Leave Europe, let me think. Let's see, there was the Exodus. No, no, I left before the\nExodus. The Exodus sailed in, I think 1t was September, I'm not sure, but I think it was\nSeptember '47, so right before that, August, July, summer of '47.",
        "Q: Why did you go home?",
        "A: Why did I go home. A very interesting story. Professor Scholem, Gershom Scholem from\nthe Hebrew University in Jerusalem had come to Germany. We got a pass for him.",
        "Q: He's the great authority on Jewish mysticism?",
        "A: Jewish mysticism, a German Jew by origin, intellect to the nth degree, a warm Jew, loved\nto be in Israel, was not against his will, he was not dragged there unwillingly. And he\ncame on a mission in the uniform of UNRRA, United Nationals Relief and\nRehabilitation. So strangers who came in on specific jobs will have to be in uniform. It\nwas a military empire there. So he wore an UNRA uniform and he had a 90 day permit\nand he was working in a warehouse in Offenbach across the river from Frankfurt where\nAlfred Rosenberg, the philosopher of the Nazi movement had collected several million\nvolumes --",
        "Q: We're going to break here only because it's too precious a conversation to lose. We have\nto change a tape.",
        "A: Okay, another tape, right.",
        "Q: I don't want to lose this.",
        "A: This is a great story.",
        "Q: No, I don't want you to go any further.",
        "A: Okay.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But we're past it 1n point of view of time.",
        "Q: Go ahead please.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about Gersham Scholem's visit?",
        "A: He received permission to come into Germany to visit and work in the Offenbach depot\nof approximately 3,000,000 volumes which Rosenberg had collected. The intent of which\nwas to form a basic library of Judaica which German scholars would study and find in the\nvery Jewish sources the words with which to condemn the Jewish people as being\nparasites and destroyers and anti-Christ and everything else so that you would condemn\nthe Jewish people out of their very own mouths. What came out of their mouths would\ncondemn them. But somebody had to find it and collate 1t and synthesize it into one\nsimple volume that then would become the property of every single decent person on\nearth. And after we have killed their bodies we will then also kill their soul and their\nspirit. So this was the intention of Alfred Rosenberg and this was the process. Now, what\nwas collected, literally actually collected physically, in that warehouse were mostly claye\nkodesh and repetitious forms of the same prayer book in different languages.",
        "Q: By claye kodesh\u2019 you mean the holy books?",
        "A: Holy books, the holy books. But among that mass of 3 million fairly unimportant\nvolumes, from his point of view, there were 1,300 priceless incunabula, manuscripts\nhandwritten from early Middle Ages and Scholem worked for 90 days like a beaver, slept\nin that same warehouse, sorting out 3 million volumes and had these 1,300 precious,\npriceless, irreplaceable items set aside. He packed them into five large wooden packing\ncrates, each five feet by five feet, not impossible to handle, not gigantic, and labeled\nthem. And that's where the fear started. Because a couple of days before his time ran out\nhe came to me and he said what are we going to do. I have applied for permission to take\n* \"Claye Kodesh\" are literally holy utensils.\nthese to the Hebrew University, the monuments and fine arts section of military\ngovernment in Germany of the American Army, monuments and fine arts section, has\nrefused me permission. They're the ones who allowed me to come and do the sorting.\nThey now refuse me permission to take these to Palestine. And at first they wouldn't give\nme an explanation for that refusal, and then I finally pushed and I got it, and the\nexplanation was that there is a rabbinical seminary in New York, I'm not sure of the name\nof it, I think it's the Theological Seminary which says that there is no reason why all of\nthese precious things should go to Palestine. All of them or some of them should be\nplaced in our library, the greatest Jewish library in New York, the greatest Jewish\npopulation in the world. This is a clear reflection of the absolutely indifferent or neutral, I\ndon't want to say anti-Zionist position of the seminary. I don't even want to say the whole\nconservative movement in 1946. And I state this publicly and it can be interpreted as a\ncondemnation. I'm not trying to condemn anybody, I'm trying to say that they had a letter\nfrom the chancellor saying, and that had to be I think at that time, Finkelstein, that the\nArmy should not allow, they should not send all these documents to Palestine. They had\nbeen collected from all the locations in Europe whose descendants are either dead or have\nmigrated to the new world. So that was their sort of cool, cold objective reasoning. The\nArmy didn't want to get into an internecine Jewish fight so it put a hold on it. And he was\ndistraught because his time was up, could not be renewed, and he didn't know what to do.\nHere he's got the stuff in five packing cases and what does he do with it. Again you have\nto make a decision at a certain moment in time and you make it, and I said Professor, go\nhome, relax, don't worry about it, I'll steal them, I'll get them out of the warehouse and I'll\nget them to you, and don't ask me how because I don't know yet myself. I was sorry that\nhe had labeled them because what was happening in Germany at the time was a very\nactive black market in pages of Beethoven and pages of Mozart, and one page was\nbringing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Much later on when the story finally broke on\nthe front page of the Stars and Stripes, and I can show you the issue which I have kept to\nthis day, it listed the value of this treasure as $5 million. He went home. What I did very\nsimply was on New Years Eve when it everybody was off duty or drunk I took a JDC\nambulance, drove it to the back loading dock. There was a Jewish captain in command of\nthe warehouse, his name was Benkovich, he was from some place in Texas, Jacob I think.\nI said listen turn your head the other way, I'm going to sign for these as though I am a\nman by the name of Koppel Pinson who was no longer in Germany, he had gone home\nfour months earlier --",
        "Q: Koppel Pinson was the professor of Queens College, a very distinguished historian?",
        "A: Right. And he worked for the JDC, the Joint, and he had permission to draw from that\nwarehouse in Offenbach books to be distributed through the camps to any children's\nschool or camp libraries that wanted any of these books so long as the officer in charge of\nthe warehouse certified that they were not irreplaceable, that they were just common\nordinary books. So Pinson had the authority to sign to draw stuff out. I signed his name,\nput my initials underneath his name. He hadn't been in Germany for four months already.\nBenkovich concurred with me, conspired jointly with me, and I said turn your head the\nother way and I'm going to take the boxes. So I took them out in the ambulance, they just\nfit. And I hid the ambulance until such time as I could get the boxes on to a freight train\nto Paris where I intended to go to 135 Avenue, Wagram, which was the Office of the\nJewish Agency, give them the boxes and say hey, deliver to Scholen. They refused to\ntake them. They wouldn't have anything to do with it. But they gave me a tip that did turn\nout to be useful, they said that Chaim Weizmann's library was being shipped from\nEngland to Palestine and it was stopping in the port at Antwerp and I could get my boxes\nof books on to the ship and mix them in with his boxes of books. They would get in to\nPalestine probably without being recognized. The British didn't care about this. This was\nWeizmann's library and Scholem's name is a professor, it was on the outside of the boxes\nso it would go okay.",
        "Q: And Chaim Weizmann was the leader of the World Zionist Movement and later became\npresident of that --",
        "A: That's the same gentleman. He lived in England for decades and had accumulated a\nmarvelous library there and at this point in his life decided that he wanted to get it\nshipped over to Palestine. An antecedent, precedent to his eventual move himself. So the\nthing was neatly executed, neatly done, and I went off on a short leave to Denmark\nbecause I wanted to see Hamlet's castle. And a few days later I came back and found two\nCID guys sitting in my office waiting for me. CID, Criminal Investigation Division of the\nUnited States Army. Very nice, sympathetic, friendly guys, not threatening, but very\nfirm. And they said listen, Chaplain, you are now under investigation seriously. This will\nlead to general court marshall. We would just like to tell you that we have you dead to\nrights, but what we really do is we need your confession, that's all. Now, here is your\nsignature on the paper your signed to draw the boxes out. Here is the number of the\nambulance of the JDC which you used to transport. Here is the number of the freight car\non which you loaded them and on which you slept overnight from Frankfurt to Paris in\nthe boxcar with the boxes. Here is the number of the truck you used to go from Paris to\nAntwerp. So, you know --",
        "Q: They had done their homework.",
        "A: -- what are you kidding about now, so would you just sign this please and then we'll get\non with it. I went to Bernstein. I stalled them and I said well listen, come on fellows, you\nknow, I mean this 1s like a bombshell, I don't know what you're talking about, I haven't\ngot any idea what this is all about, so let me try to rock it and sleep over on it and, you\nknow, I'll meet you tomorrow. I went to Bernstein and I said you remember our principle\nof need to know, well I think this one you need to know, and I told him. Without any\nmore ado he picked up the phone and he called General Clay. We're two offices away. He\nsays General, I've got to come in and see you about something, and Clay always took him\nin immediately. And it worked so well for us all the time normally. And he told Clay and\nthen he brought me in and Clay looked at me and he said why did you do it? I said\nbecause I didn't want the stuff to get stolen and lost a second time. Those boxes wouldn't\nbe secure in that warehouse, somebody would rip them open, somebody would see the\nstuff, somebody would recognize it. An antiquarian would be approached, the stuff has\nvalue. And it was lost once. Its owners are gone. The Jewish people collectively is\nconcentrating in Palestine. Palestine will be free one fine day. These should be in the\nNational Jewish Library in Palestine, that's the successor, inheritor of all this stuff. That's\nwhy I did it. He said I have to ask you a formal question, did you have any intention ever\nof diverting any of this to your own use and selling it for your own. I said no. He said I\nbelieve you. He knew me reasonably well. He said well, all right then here is what I'm\ngoing to do. I am going to order that the boxes be brought back here because I am not\ngoing to get into a fight with the seminary in New York, and I am going to let the\nmonuments and fine arts section decide on the distribution and that's the Army way. I\nsaid, sir, for God's sake don't do that, don't subject them to another voyage. An airplane\ncan go down, a ship can go down, they are irreplaceable. Don't do it. There is an\ninventory, Professor Scholem has it, he knows what he put in the boxes, there are 1,300\nitems. Have the boxes opened in Israel in the presence of any authority you trust. There's\nan American Councel there attached to the British Headquarters, take somebody, an\nAmerican, a military or non military, have him stand there as the boxes are opened and\ncheck the inventory, and then leave it there. If you want to leave it for future eventual\ndistribution, good. I'm not going to argue with you about that, but leave it there, don't\nmove it. So he looks at me, he said yes possession is 9/10ths of the law isn't it? Once it's\nthere it's there, isn't 1t? I said, sir, don't get me into that discussion. So we immediately we\nhad an understanding. So he said okay, it's a very reasonable suggestion. So ordered, and\nI will so organize it. Now, what do we do about you? I mean this is a long answer to your\nquestion about what provoked my leaving the scene. He picked up the phone, called head\nof the CID, said I want you to kill the court marshall, that's out and over, I'm sending this\nofficer back to the ZI, back to the zone of the interior. That's what the United States was\ncalled as far as the Army overseas. The United States is the interior. So this officer is\nbeing dismissed from my command and will be discharged from the Army and so you\nkill the court marshall. Finished just like that. And he came back from the phone and he\nsaid, and the boxes will remain there, are you happy, he said. Perfectly satisfied. Now, it's\nbetween Scholem and your surrogate, whoever your person is over there in charge, and\nI'm satisfied that it will work out the way we hope it will. So I was given orders to go\nback and be discharged. That story ended. I went to Fort Dix in New Jersey and the\ncustomary procedure there is that when you're being discharged they ask you a bunch of\nquestions, have you returned your gas mask, have you returned your rifle, blah, blah,\nblah. And one of the questions is, do you wish to remain in the United States Army\nReserve Corps retaining your commission and advancing in rank. So the Sergeant who is\nreading all of this to me, you know, he's doing it by rote. All of a sudden he stops\nhimself, do you wish to remain and he said oops, he said that doesn't apply to you. There\nis a note here that you are not authorized to remain in the Reserves, you are out. That's\nhow that ended. That was after being four days in the stockade for a whole other story\nbecause Morgenthau. Henry Morgenthau who was the head of the UJA said I need you to\ngo around with me making speeches in America and you've got stories to tell that will\nhelp raise a lot of money. And I said but I have to go to Fort Dix and be discharged. And\nhe said well, I'll call the Secretary of War and I said no, sir, call the Ist sergeant at the\nseparation center and he said I don't deal with sergeants, I deal with cabinet members. So\nI said well then get something in writing. He did indeed call Secretary of War Patterson,\nwho told them over the phone yes you want to keep this man with you 30 days,\nabsolutely, in uniform on detached service to you, I'll write the orders. I never got a copy\nof the orders, Fort Dix never got a copy of the orders. I had gone back 30 days later and\nI'm arrested at the gate for being AWOL, absent without leave, and the Chaplain of all\npeople to be absent without leave, I mean how can you do this. It took me four days to\nconvince them to give me a dime and let me make a phone call. And then the\ncommanding officer, general somebody, was told by Morgenthau yes I had the man on\nduty with me and I will get you a telex from Secretary Patterson and you'll have it in ten\nminutes, this guy came back to me in the cell, he gives me a cigar and he says don't hold\nanything against me. I said come on, come on, you don't think I know the racket well\nenough. No, of course it's not against you, it's against stupid Mr. Secretary Morgenthau,\nhe didn't get me anything in writing, the Army goes by what's on paper. The end of the\nstory in Israel, in Palestine was the American guy witnessed the opening of the boxes,\nagrees that not a piece 1s missing. They nail the boxes up again and they take them up to\nMount Scopus to the library. Now, we are talking about 1947, okay. In the war in 1948\nwe lose Mount Scopus, don't we? So the boxes are up there now once again in jeopardy.",
        "Q: Mount Scopus was that section of east Jerusalem that the Hebrew University was built\non?",
        "A: Originally.",
        "Q: That the Hebrew University was built on originally, and during the '48 war between\nIsrael and Jordan --",
        "A: Was lost to Jordan.",
        "Q: -- was lost to Jordan, but an Israeli contingent remained on Mount Scopus but there was\nno access to them.",
        "A: Okay, so this Israeli contingent, 140 men, were allowed to inhabit a trench between the\nAugusta Victoria Hospital on the one side and some other marker on the other side which\nwas on the apex of the hill on the top of the ridge. And these 140 guys were a symbolic\nIsraeli presence to validate Israel's previous ownership, and hopefully ultimate future\nownership, and it was one of those cockamamie arrangements that was part of the\narmistice treaty and this group of 140 men sat up there for two weeks and played cards\nand twiddled their thumbs, couldn't do any training, couldn't do anything. They were in\nthe trench. It was dreadful duty. You could only keep them up there two weeks. Every\ntwo weeks they came down under supervision of a UN convoy team which escorted them\ndown the hill to the UN truck at the bottom which took them away and replaced them\nwith 140 other guys who stayed up there for two weeks, so there was a rotation, okay.\nThe end of the story is that it took several years for the 1,300 items to come down, one by\none by one, tucked under the shirts and jackets of the rotating platoon. And every piece\ncame down finally to: \" Sof hadavar\": At the end of the story. And Scholem had the\nprivilege of putting them all in the rare book room of the new campus at Givat Ram, what\nwas then the new campus. I don't know what it is now. And I saw him, the last time I saw\nhim was a couple of years ago before he died, and I said I have to make sure. I saw a\nstory once in the Jerusalem Post by Abraham Rabinovitz who wrote the story telling\nabout the bringing down, did it all work out, did you really get them all in the end. He\nsaid every last one. And we shook hands and that was the end of the story and it was the\nlast time I ever saw him. So that's what happened to the books, that's what happened to\nme, and --",
        "Q: Then you went on a national barnstorming tour on behalf of UJA?",
        "A: Yes. I went back to Denver, the original congregation. I went with Morgenthau who was\nthe chairman, and then I went with Edward Borger?. For the next several years, let's see,\nthis is from '47, for the next eight years, the next eight years, I was a volunteer chairman\nof the Speakers Bureau for the National UJA and I was out three or four days a week,\nMonday through Thursday. I got home for the weekend, Shabbat. Anybody wants to get\nmarried we collect all the people and we do it on Sunday. Anybody wants to die better do\nit on Sunday. By Monday I'm off again and running. And eight years. Twice in that\ninterim they came and asked me if I would become the professional director of the\norganization and I turned it down. But then after a while Mr. Warburg and Mr.\nRosenwald who were the two ranking chairman of the of the UJA, both from those\naristocratic families they really said look you must do this, there is nobody like you,\nnobody has your background, nobody has your experience in the United States, not only\nwhat you did in Germany, what you have done here, the public knows you now in every\ncity in the country and you know the leading big givers in every city in the country,\nyou've been talking to them as a volunteer, now become our professional head. And there\nwas a big shuffle, a long story, I don't want to get involved in that, about the bonds and\nthe newly organized bond organization of which I was one of the founders and fully\nagreed to and didn't see why there should be any fight in any community between the\nUJA and the bonds, and that was a very precious attitude to have because so few people\nhad it at the beginning. At the beginning there was dreadful fear and competition. One\nlay leader sticks in my mind as a man who rose above it and that was a man from\nBaltimore by name of Joseph Meyerhoff and he said, he was marvelous, he said the way I\nwill prove this is that I will be the chairman of the UJA drive in Baltimore and I will be\nthe chairman of the bond drive in Baltimore and I will do them both in the same year and\nI will separate them so that they don't impinge on each other, and he was role model\nnumber one of what a good lay leader should be. And we trotted around the country\ntogether for years, he and I. And his son now is the Chairman of the Council of the\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. So the bond organization needed somebody to run it, and\nthe UJA organization needed somebody to run it, and the big boys in Israel got into the\nact because this was, we're talking heavy money, so Eshkol got into the act, Menachem\n[Nahum?] Goldmann got into the act.",
        "Q: Eshkgol was the Finance Minister and later Prime Minister?",
        "A: Later Prime Minister. And then Menachem [Nahum?] Goldmann was President of the\nWorld Zionist Congress following Chaim Weitzman.|[?] [Nahum Goldmann was\npresident of the World Jewish Congress] So when the heavy weights got in and came\npressing on me I really couldn't say no. I shifted in the interim from being the rabbi in\nDenver to being in Milwaukee, and they came to Milwaukee and they spoke to the board\nand they said you've got to release this man. So they did, and I did and that was it. Then I\nswitched over from being a volunteer to being the executive, the CEO, of the UJA, and\ndid that until the '70s when we left and moved over to live in Israel for a period of years,\nwith every intention of remaining. Got diverted because of some family illness and\nwound up back here.",
        "Q: Let me touch on two issues we haven't touched on, on the European experience. What\nwas the attitude of the DP population toward the Germans, and what was it like for them\nto live in Germany? And let's start with that for a moment.",
        "A: It's really a serious question and it's easily answered. The DPs lived mostly in camps.\nThere were no machine guns aimed at them and there were no guards at the gates, but\nthey were in an encircled area, they were in a camp. A few of them were out and were\nliving freely in rented quarters among the German population, they were comfortable\ndoing that, but 99 percent were in camps. They used to look through the wire around the\ncamps and they used to see Germans going on buses, carrying little briefcases, going to\nwork. The town was working and everybody was living a normal existence except they.\nThey hated the Germans. They resented them. They didn't envy them. They just would\nlike to have torn every German apart if they could get their hands on them. Now, they\ncould because as I said they were not confined, they went out into the towns near which\nthese camps were located. They bought goods in the German stores. They learned to\nspeak German, many of them did. But you could see the look in their eye and they hated\nevery German. Every once in a while some episode would flare up and you would see the\nexpression of it in a physical form of rebellion. And I'll just tell you one story which\nillustrates many many similar things that happened. It was in the camp at Landsberg.\nLandsberg was the town where Hitler was in prison. In that very same German Army\nbarracks in which he was imprisoned in 1925, yes, '24, '25 when he wrote \"Mein Kampf,\"\nare now living Jewish displaced persons. So you can imagine what an irony that was.\nOkay, in this camp at Landsburg one day a rumor spread through the camp that a Jewish\nchild had been kidnapped and killed by the Germans. Immediately a riot started through\nthe whole camp, and a wave rushed out of gates of the camp into town and started to\nbreak store windows, start buildings on fire, over-turned buses, attack and pummel any\nGerman passerby, quickly the town turned into an armed camp. The purpose of the Army\nwas to keep law and order. Here it was breaking down between Jews and Germans, okay.\nThat's dynamite, that's incendiary. So the Army pushed the Jews back into the camp and\nclosed the gates and padlocked them. Okay, now you have U.S. troops ringed around and\na couple of 50 caliber machine guns are brought and set up and a tank is hovering\ndelicately in the background but present, visibly present. And so the Jews start yelling\n\"Amerikanische SS, you American soldiers are acting like the SS. Amerikanische Nazis.\"\nWell, now the lieutenant in charge of this platoon says whoa, whoa, we're not Nazis and\nwe're not here to hurt you, but you can't come and tear and town, and the dialogue goes\nand the Jews boom!, burst out of the padlocked camp once more and break the gates.\nThen the scuffle starts between American troops and Jewish DPs and Germans ringing\naround looking at it with great pleasure, okay.",
        "Q: Now you guys have your Jewish problems.",
        "A: 19 young fellows get arrested. They were the ones at the front. So they were the activists,\nand one of them has a knife in his pocket. Later when they're arrested and they are\nbrought into the police station and one of them has got a piece of lead pipe in his pocket,\nand one of them has got a hammer in his pocket, and anything that could be used as a\nweapon, okay. So they are charged with, I don't know what the technicality of the charge\nis, but it's disturbing the peace and it's inciting to riot, and nobody was murdered and\nnobody was killed. By then incidently it is discovered that the little boy who was missing\nwas not dead, that there was a hole in the fence at the back of the camp going right into\nthe woods, and he had gone out there and he had wanted to do whatever, maybe he\nwanted to smoke a cigarette, nobody knows, but nothing had happened to the kid and the\nkid had came back in. And so the whole rumor that had started the whole thing was of\ncourse inaccurate. But by now you've got 19 fellows in the stockade. Word of this gets\nback to the United States. There was a Congressman from Illinois by the name of Adolph\nSabboth, an old guy, he was about 80 years old. He informed the press and the\nDepartment of War that he intended to go to Germany and himself make sure that these\nJews got an honest and fair treatment from the American Army and the American Army\nwasn't going to treat them like the Nazis did. And he's shaking his fist in everybody's\nface. And of course word of this gets back to General Clay and this is exactly what he\nneeds his advisor for, so General Clay says to me you go down to -- Bernstein says to me\nyou go down to Landsburg, you sort this thing out, you make sure that these guys get a\nproper defense. They're in front of a court marshall of seven officers, so it's going to have\nto be a military officer who will have to defend them and there will be a military\nprosecutor, and I want you there as my personal representative. And you have all of my\nauthority and you report to the commanding general that you are there on my behalf so he\nknows who you are and you follow this thing every step of the way because this is\ndynamite. Okay, the end of the story very quickly, I went to the Judge Advocate General\nand I asked him for the best lawyer he had in the United States Army. And he tells me\nthat guy who handles all death sentences given by courts marshall for murder, rape, all\nthe felony one kind 1s a captain by the name of Abraham Heimann, and I say fine, I want\nhim. Heimann said if I get mixed up in this DP business I'll never get home for five years.\nI'm due to be demobilized. I said Abe, come on, come on, come on. And to make a long\nstory short he came on and he came down and he was the defense attorney and he\ndefended them as well as he could and brilliantly.",
        "Q: And he didn't get home for five years?",
        "A: He did not. He wound up as the last, the final advisor when Ferinwald?, the final camp,\nclosed in 1950 Heimann, the last advisor, went home finally in 1950. So anyhow, the trial\nended. They were given three months which was, you know, the admonitory slap on the\nwrist with time off for good behavior. So they probably might have served, you know,\nthree weeks, four weeks, something like that. However, Heimann pleaded and obtained\nfor the right that they should not be put in a prison with Germans, they should not be put\nin a prison with American soldiers in the stockade, they should be put in some separate\nplace where the Army can have a few guards and watch over them. And we find an old\nabandoned castle nearby, quite nearby, so their families could come and visit them, and\nwithin four weeks we had all 19 of them out and on their way through the Aliyah Bet and\nthey were taken off Marseilles to a ship to Palestine and that was the end of that.",
        "Q: Let's touch on one more question which is really more a historical question, but also part\nof your own experience. July 4th 1946--",
        "A: Oh, Kielce, the Kielce Pogrom, is that the one you're referring to? Oh, that was a bitter\none, bitter, bitter, bitter. 42 Jews were killed that day and the bodies were laid around the\nfountain in the center of this little medieval looking village, a beautiful little village, and\nthe bodies were like cord wood in a circle around the fountain. A ripple went through all\nof Europe, and of course it reached Germany and it reached Army Headquarters. And\nGeneral McNarney who was the commander at that moment said to Rabbi Bernstein, take\nmy airplane, go over to Warsaw, go to wherever you have to go, find out what's going on\nthere, find out what caused it, find out what it's implications are, and what the\nconsequences might be, if any, for us here in Germany. Because he knew, he was\nsophisticated enough to know that this was going to trigger off another flood of people\nleaving the east and trying to cross the border into Germany where they would be safe.\nWe did, we went. Unbelievable. We went to see the American Ambassador whose name\nwas Arthur Bliss Lane. There was only one hotel in Warsaw, and the Polonia, and it was\nhalf smashed. And he had two rooms, the American Ambassador had two rooms in this\nhotel. That's all he had. No embassy. And he had gout and his foot was up on a hassock\nand he was mean and he was miserable. And he said listen, this has nothing to do with\nme, don't talk to me about these Jews and what happened in Kielce. It's not an American\nproblem, it's not an embassy problem, it doesn't involve anything, it doesn't involve a\nconsular division, it doesn't involve reparations, nothing. And probably whatever\nhappened to them they damn well deserved. That was his parting shot. Thank you, sir,\nMr. Ambassador, very much. We went to see the Prime Minister, Mr. Edward Losupka\nMorafska. Quite bland. I really, you know, there is some latent anti-semitism among the\nPolish people, everybody knows that, that's historic fact, I don't know what triggered if\noff, I don't know what caused it, but it will die down the way it always does. And I mean\nthere is nothing that the Polish government will or can or should do about there. There\nare no culprits, we can't find anybody. We go to see the Cardinal, Augustus Cardinal\nHlond, H-L-O-N-D, a bull-necked, cropped hair, tough as nails. He never asked us to sit\ndown, the whole interview was standing. And his attitude was very simple, these Jews\nbrought Communism here. The head of the Communist party running this country is a\nJew by the name of Yacob Berman. Whatever the Polish people of the town of Kelts did\nto those Jews they did out of anger and fury and rage because the Jews have put this\nanchor around our necks. And the church will do nothing. We tried and we asked him if\nhe would write a pastoral letter which should be read in every church and this would kind\nof put a blanket on the -- he wouldn't do it. So our fourth visit we went to Mr. Berman,\nand Yacob Berman says if the Jews are guilty of having brought Communism here to\nPoland it's the best thing that we could ever do for this country and I will take whatever\nconsequences. And furthermore, if the consequences are that a few Jews get killed, well a\nfew Jews get killed. It's just a few more. We are fighting for a whole new world. And he\nwas a Communist idealogue and he believed it and he preached it. And we're fighting for\na whole new world means for everybody and for a larger number of Jews, and even if\nthere were a few casualties there always are in war. And the last point I want to make\nwith you gentlemen is that they should remain here. If you came from Germany from the\nAmerican commander to find out if the Jews here are going to flee, if I have anything to\ndo I will see to it that they will leave this country nakt und barfuss, they will go out naked\nand barefoot because they shouldn't go out. Well, you know, this was zero for four. We\nhad seen four people, the Ambassador, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal, and then the\nCommunist leader, and you get no sympathy from any of them. But then when we started\nto go around and we began to talk to the Haganah guys who were working in the towns\nand we began to talk to ordinary Jews whom we were recommended to, we got the\npicture that they're packing and leaving. And we returned and we wrote the report to\nMcNarney that he could expect, that the military command in Germany could expect\nover the period of the next year to a year and a half approximately 150,000 people to\ncome flooding in from the east to the west. And the Army had better gear up for it and\nprepare it, and the Army would have a political decision to make, not a military one as to\nwhether the borders should be closed or opened. And if you want to close the borders and\nyou want to try to prevent these Jews from coming in then you're going to have to do it\nby armed force or setting up barriers and blockades. McNarney looked at that and he said\nwell, whoa, this is way over my head. Bernstein, go to Washington please and talk to the\nPresident. A decision about whether the border of Germany is open or closed to 150,000\nrefugees is not for me to make. So Phil did, he flew to Washington and talked to Truman.\nIt took about 15 minutes. He got an immediate green light, and he came back. Okay,\nMcNarney has got a green light from the President, the borders are open. So Lippman is\non the Czechoslovak border and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the borders are all manned\nwith our people and that is what raised the ultimate total to 250,000 people. It's just as\nsimple as that. That was the final result of the Kielce Pogrom. Those 42 victims triggered\noff a major demographic shift. And the accumulation of that many people in the camps in\nGermany itself had the political influence plus the episode of the Exodus to produce that\nvote in the United Nations in November of '47. By November of '47 everything is falling\ninto place.",
        "Q: Let me push this phase to the close by asking a question. Where were you on May 14th\n1948, or where were you on November 29th '47?",
        "A: I don't remember the latter date where I was. I was probably -- no, I was still in Denver in\n'47. Of course, I was still in Denver. I was in Denver November 29th '47. May 15th '48 I\nwas shuttling between Denver, New York and Wilmington, Delaware. Wilmington,\nDelaware had to do with DuPont. New York had to do with the Haganah headquarters 1n\nthe United States which was in a hotel, 14th East 60th Street. Next door to the\nCopacabana nightclub. The director of the Haganah in the United States was Mr. Teddy\nKollek, now the Mayor of Jerusalem, a world famous figure. So Teddy had ordered me\nwhen I returned to the States, he reminded me that I was still in the Haganah and never\nmind I was running around making speeches for the UJA, that's kid stuff. As far as the\nHaganah is concerned it's real stuff, and he wanted me to, contrary to the embargo laws\nof the United States Government, to buy, pack, ship out of the United States all the\ndynamite, brick production, of DuPont. A brick is a brick, the size of a brick, the size and\nshape of a brick, but this brick is a piece of dynamite. Now you take three of them, stack\nthem up one on top of each other, and take three more, one on top of each other, and wire\nthe six of them together and attach the wire, whatever length you want, to a detonator and\nyou blow up that package, we called it a satchel charge because you took the six bricks,\nput them inside of a knapsack, you know, a canvas GI knapsack, it looked like a little\nsatchel, it should have been called a knapsack charge more accurately, and it will blow a\nhole in a stone wall or it will blow a hole through an iron gate. And that was the main\nartillery that the Israel Armed Forces had. It didn't have any big artillery, it didn't have\nmortars, Howitzers. So I was buying the dynamite, shipping it to myself in Denver, trans-\nshipping it down to Tampico in Mexico, buying vessels, getting the stuff on board in\ncardboard cartons that said \"Del Monte peaches, fruit salad, pineapples.\" We stole the\ncartons from Del Monte, California. And the ships were manifested to the Far East, but\nwhen they went out of Tampico they didn't turn and go through the canal to the Far East,\nthey went to the Mid East, in the other direction. So that's where I was all through '48. '48\nwas a hell of a year with me and the FBI. But everything came out okay. No charges, no\nnothing, and a happy ending to the story.",
        "Q: Herb, is there anything we haven't touched?",
        "A: No, Michael. No, I think we've covered the main things. But the summary of the whole\nbusiness is that you had a population that had the patience and the stamina to overcome\nall of the evil and the agony they had been through, all the losses they had suffered, and\nwho had the hope and the faith in something they believed in that represented their\nfuture. So the patience and the stamina, the faith and hope characterized that DP\npopulation. With all the hatred boiling in them, with all of the stuff that many of them\nhave never gotten out of their systems for their whole lives, that's one element. Then\nyou've got the other supporting elements. You've got the group, you've got the United\nStates Army, benevolent, friendly, cooperative. I can't compliment them enough. Number\ntwo, you've got the group of American Jewish organizations that came in with dough and\nsupport. Number three, you've got the Israelis, the Palestinian personalities beginning\nwith Ben Gurion himself and the whole mechanism of the Haganah and their support that\nthey provided. And then lastly you have won over world public opinion so that you get\nthat great ringing majority vote of two when the resolution was finally passed in\nNovember of '47. It won by two. The two countries were the Philippines and Guatemala,\ngreat big Democratic powers that pushed the ball over the line. But that was the\ncombination. Now, we've talked about the DPs themselves and we've talked about the\nArmy and we've talked about the JDC and the great organizations. We've talked about the\nHaganah and the Israelis. The world conscieuce, feeble as it was, did its trick and the\nState was created. And I sum that whole thing up when I think of myself and my life and\nwhere I am now and what did it all mean, I really believe the following statement, and it\nmay sound strange to you, those three years from 1945 when the war ended until 1948\nwhen the State was established, those three years I think are the single group of any three\nyears in the entire history of the Jewish people, and I mean every single thing I can think\nof that we've been through since Abraham, I don't think there is another period of three\nyears which has ever been so determinative. Because we came out of the death into the\nlife and those are the two extremes, death and life. There aren't any others. There is\nnothing similar. Persecution and inquisition of this one or that one, or running from one\ncountry, running from another country, that's all blips on the screen. But this is the\ndefinitive thing. We could have passed off the stage of history. There's no doubt in my\nmind about it. One third of the people dead in Europe, one third of the people paralyzed\nand ineffective in America during the crucial years, almost another third of the people\nlost behind the Iron Curtain, you couldn't get to them, they couldn't be useful or helpful.\nThe Jewish people almost died, I mean totally and finally and irrevocably. And out of\nthat three short years later you find you're back into vibrancy and action and you're\nwinning a war. That's a miracle. I don't know any other miracle, and I'm even talking\nabout the crossing of the Red Sea, and I'm talking about anything else you want to\nmention, I don't know of anything else that's comparable to it. So if I had the zekhut, the\nmerit, to live through those three years, work my way through those three years, add\nsomething, well then it was a life worth living. And that's how I sum it up.",

    "answers": [
        "A: My name is Herbert Friedman. And my early background is really very simple. I was\nborn in New Haven in 1918. My father had migrated to the States from Vilna, my mother\nfrom Riga, good stock. The two of them, they met and married in Connecticut I think it\nwas, and that's where I grew up. I went to high school there, I went to university there,\nand graduated from Yale in 1938. Two brothers, both of whom are still living. A strong,\ntight, good Jewish family. Conservative congregation in town. Quite modern in those\ndays, from my parents, men and women sitting together, organ in the congregation. The\nRabbi, a wonderful person, himself Vilna-born, but took a Ph.D. at Yale, writing three\nvolumes of the history of the Jews of Russia in English. I mean that was a man, good\nbrain, good human being, and working in this small middle class ordinary congregation,\nnothing famous about him, but very impressive to me.",
        "A: Well, that's the whole story. The whole story of my life revolves around that. In college\nbetween the years of 1934 to '38, formative years, fully cognizant of what was happening,\nas fully as anybody could be who watched carefully. The argument that people didn't\nknow what was going on in those days has never never seemed valid to me because you\ncould read it in the New York Times. I did. If I did, others did. But at any rate, it bothered\nme when I looked around '34, '35, '36, in '36 the Nuremberg laws were passed. It was\nquite clear what the intent was. Hitler's book was out. He had been in jail in Landsberg,\nhe wrote it there back in 1925. The book was available to be read. I read parts of it. It's\nturgid writing, it's not easy, Mein Kampf, but never mind you've got the picture. So that I\ncould not understand the silence of the whole American Jewish Community around me. I\ndid understand some of the politics. There was a difference quite clear in those days\nbetween the \"Ost-Juden,\" the Russian-Polish Jews and the German Jews. The American\nJewish Committee was in correspondence with people in Berlin who were advising them\nquiet, don't raise a fuss, you'll make it worse, don't organize protests, no, don't listen to\nStephen Wise, don't have a parade down Fifth Avenue, and they were attracted by that\nkind of advice, they were even enchanted by it. It gave them a perfect rationalization.\nNow, there not the only villain in the piece, everybody latched on to that. So I don't want\nto be misunderstood about the American Jewish Committee only or specifically. The\nmood was (a) we're not sure of what's happening, (b) it can't be as bad as some people are\nsaying it is, (c) what can we do about it anyhow, and (d) the American Government isn't\ndisturbed, and Franklin Roosevelt is a great friend of the Jews and he isn't upset. Nobody\nis upset. All of these factors seemed to me to be leading to a dreadful conclusion. So on\nthe specific point of how I was reacting in terms of what I saw around me, I was getting\nmore and more furious, that's a worthwhile word, and frustrated and that was the\ncondition that I felt I was in when I was 19 years old and had graduated from the\nuniversity, okay.",
        "A: Young, yes.",
        "A: Well, don't forget we were at the tail end of the Depression, and a man in New York by\nthe name of Samuel Leidesdorf, a big accounting firm, and a major factor in the New\nYork, UJA -- well, it wasn't yet the UJA, it was the Palestine Appeal, said to me I'll give\nyou a job as an accountant for $25.00 a week if you'll go to Columbia Business School\nand learn accounting. So, okay, $25.00 a week, and so I went to Columbia Graduate\nSchool of Business, stayed one year, couldn't stand it for another day, couldn't dream of\nmyself as being an accountant, so I quit.",
        "A: A week.",
        "A: Oh, gosh, I don't know. 30 times that amount, $700.00, $800.00 a week. A very good job.",
        "A: Oh, yes, a nice starting salary, perfectly acceptable. Tuition was $450.00 at Yale. Today\nit's $23,500.00. So that there I was, I was at the end, I owed money to Yale, I owed\nmoney to Columbia and it's now 1939, the war has not yet broken out in Europe but it's\nimminent, and America is 1n a totally isolationist mood, no thought of participating in it.\nRoosevelt was jockeying like mad to give the British some support and so he was making\nthese funny deals called lend/lease, we will lend you some of our destroyers on lease, you\nwill pay us rent for our destroyers, but we're not going to get into your war. So it was\nreally so ambivalent and so confused and so costly in the long run. At any rate my\npersonal requirements were that I had better go and get a job. So I went back to New\nHaven and got a job in a factory working at a sewing machine making blankets. I worked\ntwo shifts, 16 hours a day, and I earned enough money to pay back all the debts. And I\nalso did the most important thing at that stage in my life, I decided what I really wanted\nto do.",
        "A: I tried to figure out during all those mindless hours at the machine where all you're trying\nto do is keep your hand away from the needle which you're just feeding cloth through and\nit's robot work, and I said why should I continue being so frustrated. If the American\nJewish Community isn't awake why don't I try to awaken them, but how do you do that.\nThat's when I decided that I would become a rabbi, not because of any theological sudden\ninsights, I had no epiphanies, I had no -- I conceived of myself really as a civil servant.\nAnd if I had a platform from which to speak I would use that platform to try to wake\npeople up. It was sort of simplistic, very idealistic, but satisfying to me. On the other\nhand, again I felt I'm stopping myself for at least three years from getting into any action\nmode and yet I'd better do that or else I'll be frustrated the rest of my life. So I finished\nwith the factory, backed off, went to rabbinical seminary with Stephen Wise in New\nYork, and we did four year's worth of work in three, no summer vacations, no nothing,\n11-1/2 months you worked, two weeks off, and kept going that way.",
        "A: Well, Wise being the person he was and focused the way he was, every one of the\nstudents in the school became acutely sensitized to the current events around us. So, sure,\neverybody was preparing for a career, you needed to get a pulpit or a job somewhere to\nearn your living, but the ideology was developing among this group before the school\nmerged with the Hebrew Union College out in Cincinnati. It graduated about 220 reform\nrabbis, but reform rabbis of a totally different kind than Cincinnati was producing. I sat\nfor all those years next to a fellow by the name of Osher Krishblu- (e or m?) who later\nbecame the Chairman of the Misrachi, and he sat with his kippa and I sat without a kippa\nand the whole faculty liked it that way and Wise liked it that way, and the dean, Henry\nSlominski liked it that way, it was a school in which \"Klal Israel\" or pluralism or\nwhatever word you want to use, which is so fashionable today, was really being practiced\nin the '30s and '40s, the only school in which it was being carried out as a definite\nideological objective, and every student picked it up.",
        "A: Well, his role in the American Jewish Community was superb. He was the leader of the\nprotest, the ceaseless effort to try to persuade Roosevelt, to whom he had automatic\naccess, Rabbi Stephen Wise was acceptable to Roosevelt at request, and saw him\nfrequently. He failed to convince him of anything, but Wise was the pusher, Wise was the\nageressor seeking to have a large protest meeting in Madison Square Garden, and we'll\nget 25,000 people there or 20,000 whatever the Garden holds. And he filled it every time,\ntalking about the fact we must do something. He sounded -- he was the only one who\nsounded the tocsin, the call, he was the bugle. Almost no response except in those of us\nwho were listening to him very very carefully and very closely. I adored him, I admired\nhim, I respected him. The personal impact used to come on Thursday mornings. Thursday\nmorning he had a class called problems of the ministry. A big round table, seminar table,\n18, 12 students around the table. And problems of the ministry or how do you conduct a\nwedding how do you conduct a funeral? Nothing of the sort. He would go into his pocket,\nhe would take out the latest telegram that he got from the World Jewish Congress,\nRiegner in Geneva, and because he was a key player in the World Jewish Congress he\nstarted the American Jewish Congress, he believed in Democracy and he had hoped that\nthose organizations would really be democratic in the sense every member would vote for\nits officiers. It never happened that way in practice, but in theory it was at that time the\nmost democratic, and still to this day the most liberal organization I think in existence in\nthe panoply of our alphabet soup. So he would take the telegram out and tell us what was\nthe latest stuff going on in Europe in this camp or that camp, or this ghetto or another.",

        "A: On us?",
        "A: Devastating and confirming. It confirmed us in our desire, because I wasn't the only one\nwho felt this frustrated and who wanted to get out there and try to wake up -- so we were\ngetting confirmation to our own personal feelings from him. And I think that if he felt\nthat he was failing to arouse the street. He was succeeding in arousing us. That was, I\nthink, the greater of two contributions which he made. And we were champing at the bit.\nAnd so many of us in those classes spent the one year which the Army required for you\nto go and be an intern, that is by medical metaphor. You graduated medical school, now\nbe an intern in the hospital for a year, and then we will take you into the Army and we'll\ncommission you as a medical officer. The same with clergymen., go out, get your\ncongregational experience, what good that was going to do you in the Army I have no\nidea, but that was their bureaucracy. And so each of us was impatient to get out, get the\ncongregational job, spend the year and then get into the chaplaincy.",
        "A: Well, it was in '42.",
        "A: Aug. '42. I didn't remember which month exactly. Well, so then it would have been a\nweek or two weeks thereafter. Remember I said school was continuous, there were no\nsummer vacations. So let's call it -- yes, it was before Rosh Hashanah. Yes I remember it\nnow. So I can't tell you the exact date, but we all used it in sermons that we made. I used\nit. remember I used it. But who was listening to us. I mean we didn't make any ripples.\nStudents make any ripples out in the big world. And if you were a student-Raggi at --\nwhere was I? It was a place in Virginia. So you're talking to one group of people and\nyou're reading this telegram to them and you're saying wake up, wake up. The impact was\nquite limited, quite personal. And, you know, the Riegner telegram of 1942 became such\na big sensation later as proof that we had evidence and everybody chose to bury it.\nWyman in his book talks about the fact that the State Department didn't want it\ntransmitted to anybody, they wanted it just kept secret. They were afraid of what impact\nit would make and so indeed it didn't make any for a long time. But Wise had it. We his\nstudents had it. We tried to get it out. I don't know when it hit the press.",
        "A: I don't think he stood still long enough to see his own role. He was in constant motion.\nHe was in furious motion. And the fact that he would meet us every Thursday morning at\n11:00 o'clock week after week after week, year after year meant that that was a holy\nmoment for him, a crucial moment. If you can transmit something to your students then\nat least your mortality becomes less important. If you can't transmit anything to anybody\nand it's all bottled up in you, then it's dreadful that you are going to die with that. But he\nnever had a sense of dying. He was vigorous and always moving, speaking out ....Listen,\nhe was the prime spokesman to the non Jewish world not just to the Jewish world. In the\nfirst half of the 20th century every clergyman in this country knew the name of Stephen\nWise. And so his satisfactions came from that. Toward the end he developed cancer in\nthe throat and died in '49 never having set foot on the sovereign soil of the State of Israel.\nAt the very end I remember seeing him once and he said that was the greatest tragedy of\nhis life. He spent his whole life working for the cause of Zionism and when it reached its\nfruition he never had the joy and the glory of setting foot on that soil.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. Later after he died in Cincinnati, I think it was\nstill Nelson Glick who was the president out there, came and pushed for the merger.\nSome of us fought against the merger. We had a different conception of what the reform\nmovement was then they did. Rabbi Morton Berman of Chicago, I remember, and Rabbi\nPhilip Bernstein of Rochester, those were two of my very close friends. They were a few\nyears ahead of me, a few years older than I was, but still we became very friendly. We\nfought the merger unsuccessfully, because Wise dead and no fund-raising -- he was the\nprime fund-raiser, he kept it going. So the merger took place. We scattered. I left. I was\ngraduated and went out to Denver in '43. Wise said to me, you go to Denver. Wise used\nto think that if he could place a man in a pulpit somewhere that he would then have a\nright to go to that man and to do some fund-raising in that congregation in support of the\nalma mater, the school you went to. So he was always desperately seeking good\ncongregational placements. Well, this was a congregation out there that had a thousand\nfamily memberships in 1943. The congregation was older than the State of Colorado.\nColorado came into the Union in 1876. Centennial State, that's the name of the book\nCentennial that what's his name wrote, Michener. The congregation was 1874. It was\nstarted by Simon Guggenheim, later Senator Guggenheim, American Mining and\nSmelting Company, a powerful, big German classical reform (Temple). So Wise pushed\nme as, I guess one of his favorite sons, into that congregation. Stay there and we'll always\nthen have a foot in the door.",
        "A: Well, I had a lovely year there, fighting hard with the congregation. Their previous rabbi,\nalso named Friedman, had been there for 50 years and taught then anti-Zionism, anti-\nHebrew, anti-Bar Mitzvah, anti-Oriental ceremonials like putting on a hat, etcetera,\netcetera. 50 years, two generations, I couldn't dream of upsetting that in one year, but I\ngot close to it, split the congregation. I said why don't you guys go off and be\nhomogeneous in your anti-Zionism, I'm going to take this congregation and turn it\naround. So you're going to be listening to stuff that's going to irritate you, and your\npresence out there in front 1s going to irritate me, so take a Safer Torah and goodbye.\nToday Denver has two big, big strong reform temples. The anti group has long since\ncome back. So I think I did a good thing. That was the year. And then I went to the\nArmy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I'm not sure what you mean by how did I experience the division. I exacerbated the\ndivision inside the temple by splitting it. And on the basis of this ideological definition of\nZionism as being compatible with reformed Judaism, '43 was the crucial year in which\nthe Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a vote on the resolution \"Is reform\nJudaism compatible with Zionism.\" That's the way the resolution was framed and the\nvotes were taken, role call vote name by name by name by name. You had to stand up, it\nwas not a secret ballot. The vote was three to one in favor of that resolution. Yes, these\ntwo ideologies are perfectly compatible, three to one, 300 to 100. And the 100 guys went\noff and formed the American Council for Judaism, the anti-Zionist organization. The 300\nguys controlled the future growth of the reform movement. But it wasn't only on the\nZionist issue, it was on the issue of ritual. What is a Bar Mitzvah? What a silly, stupid\nthing. That boy isn't a man at the age of 13. We do not have Bar Mitzvahs. Well, and that\nwas the practice out in Cincinnati. That's the way those graduates were being taught. Our\ngraduates were pushing greater ritual observance, so we were accused of being Orthodox.\nWell, on order to validate that accusation which I thought was the ironic way to handle\nthe whole thing, my best friend in town was a Rabbi Manuel Lederman who was the\nOrthodox rabbi in town. It used to delight my supporters when they would see the two of\nus walking down the street together. It used to infuriate my enemies and gave them\nvisible proof that I was a traitor to the reform movement. We were friends all our lives.\nAnd his son, Paul, who lives in Jerusalem now, I still see once in a while.",
        "A: No, there was a move on behalf of Zionism. You know the accusation which is made\nagainst Ben Gurion himself and all the Palestinian-centered Zionist officials, that they\ndidn't pay much attention to the holocaust, they didn't express their outrage at it, they\ndidn't do very much except the Haganah, the military arm of the Jewish agency which\ntried to do something about it because, and these are the theories, because the Zionist\nleaders felt that the battle over saving Jewish life in Europe was lost, but that the battle\nfor creating a state which would harbor whoever would be left alive had yet to be won.\nSo of the two battles, why fight the one which is already hopeless, you must fight the one\nwhich contains the hope for the future. Now that was pretty much Ben Gurion's\nphilosophy. We talked about it many times and he wasn't cold, he wasn't calloused, his\nheart was as wounded as everybody's was, but he was a terribly practical and pragmatic\nperson. And so he said I've got to concentrate on Zionism and building the state. I want a\nJewish army. He was fighting for that as part of the Allied armies in order to stake a\nclaim afterwards to be able to sit at the peace table.",
        "A: Well, I first met him in Paris in '45. So in '43 I didn't yet know him, but I knew the\nZionist concept that concentrated instead on trying to persuade the as yet unconvinced\nAmerican Jewish public that that's where the future lie. 1943 was only a year after the\nBiltmore Resolution was passed. The Zionists themselves never dared use the word\n\"state\" until 1942. They were also groping their way toward the definition of their own\nmovement. Courage finally prevailed. Again, Ben Gurion at the Biltmore Hotel, that's the\nname from which the resolution was drawn, had a big conference there. Ben Gurion\nstood up and said we must pass a resolution that we are trying to create a country, a state.\nThis was quite revolutionary in '42. In '43 in Denver we're all arguing about that. And I\nwas preaching sermon after sermon about state and army, army and state, independence\nand sovereignty, these are the only answers to powerlessness. We're powerless without\nthem.",
        "A: Well because the fight was there. I mean the point is that I could continue trying to argue\nwith these Jews in Denver, and I made tremendous strides with them and I knew I would\nwin the fight or history would win the fight, not I, but I wanted to be where the history\nwas. So 365 days to the day, like the prisoner scratches the nail on the cement wall of the\ncell when the calendar -- and my old friend Rabbi Bernstein, Phil Bernstein, was the\nExecutive Secretary of the Chaplaincy Commission of the Jewish Welfare Board, which\ncertified to the Army that this rabbi yes indeed is sane and etcetera and we recommend\nthat you take him and commission him First Lieutenant. I think it was $1,000.00 a month.\nThat was better than the $25.00, which was the last offer I had.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Sure. What do you think I was being paid in the congregation? $75.00 a week, $75.00 a\nweek, $3,600.00 a year. So Army pay was fabulous, it was great. $3,600.00 a year. The\nArmy was the Mecca. And then you go through the process. You go to a chaplaincy\nschool in Fort Devens? in Massachusetts. You go to an infantry training regiment in\nCamp Blanding in Florida. And then you are assigned -- I was assigned as an infantry\nchaplain and you get -- we sailed from Boston and were put into a replacement depot up\nin Belgium in a little town called Namur. And then you get assigned to a regiment. I was\nassigned to the 9th Infantry Division which was part of the Third Army which was\nGeneral Patton. They were fighting over in Germany. We were in this depot in Belgium.\nSo then I was in already and feeling less strange about a uniform and saluting and\nshooting and all that stuff.",
        "A: '45, spring of '45. I mentioned Namur. I have to tell you a story. This was a small town in\nBelgium and we are in a big camp outside of town and thousands of officers being\nshuffled around and it's paperwork and that takes (x) number of weeks before everybody\ngets sorted out. So one day I was walking through this little village, hardly more than a\nvillage, and I see a store front with a Magen David on the window.",
        "A: Yes. A Star of David, yes. Well, okay, wow, what's this! I went past it a number of times\nuntil one day I saw that it was open and there were people inside. I walked in and in the\nsecond room, in the back and not visible to the street, I realized that this was a\nsynagogue. There was a little Ark and over the Ark there was a picture of a catholic priest\nwith a collar and no name, no designation. So I found one old man there who was sort of\nthe caretaker and he told me the story. What are you doing over the Holy Ark, this\ncatholic priest? Well, his name is Father Andre and we respect him because he saved so\nmany Jewish lives, and the story pours out. The Gestapo headquarters in Namur was in a\nbuilding that was right next to the church, and in the back of the church was where the\npriest was living and he had his bedroom and he had a kitchen, and the Gestapo officers,\nmany of whom are catholic, half the population of Germany, many of whom used to\ncome to sit and drink wine with the priest. And the priest figured that his bedroom next\ndoor to this kitchen was the safest place to hide Jews. And he was one on the network of\nan underground railroad that was passing Jews through town trying to get them -- the\nultimate safest destination was Portugal, neutral country, so it was always moving south.\nTwo Jews, four Jews in his bed, under his bed, in the big wardrobe. Four Gestapo\nofficers, five meters, ten feet away. Risky! I mean the material that movie pictures are\nmade out of. Not a single Jew was caught. Crazy things would happen. Four kids would\nshow up at the back door. He had to excuse himself, run, take them, push them under the\nbed, go back to the Gestapo guys. Never a problem, never a failure, never a death.\nHundreds of Jews were saved going through his bedroom. When it was all over they\ndecided they wanted -- the few remaining Jews wanted to give him a present so they\nbought him a new bed to replace his bed which had gotten so badly smashed in, which he\nhad never slept for two years. And put his picture up over the Ark. And that was the first\ntime I ever learned about \"Haside1 Umoth Ha'olam,\" the righteous Gentiles of the world.\nAnd more and more today we're beginning to hear about them, and he was one.",
        "A: Auschwitz was at its height in '44 and '45. Treblinka, '43 after the ghetto, that was the end\nof it, so Treblinka was at its height '42, '43. Sobibor, Etc., all of them. '43, '44, '45, they\nwere at the height of production. So when you say what did I know about it, I knew those\nfacts. I knew the facts that the Americans had refused and the British had refused\nbombing Auschwitz even though both Air Forces were over-flying the Ploesti oil fields\nin Rumania which were about ten minutes of flying time away from Auschwitz. And they\nwere using the excuse that they did not want to jeopardize Allied equipment and\nmanpower. But it was an excuse, they were already flying past Ploesti, they could have.\nThis just increased the sense of powerlessness. We can't convince anybody so we're\ngoing to have to do this ourselves. And the \"this\" has to be a firm determination to get the\nstate and get back into a situation of power over our own destiny. But there was nothing\nthat could be done about it.",
        "A: Dachau was liberated. I say Dachau because the division that I was with was down in\nsouthern Germany and we were at that time posted over in a little down called\nWasserburg am Inn which was between Munich and Saltzburg. Dachau was right outside\nof Munich. Dachau was liberated by the 42nd Division, I would say about May of '45,\nokay.",
        "A: April 29th, okay. It's good to have a real expert here. Now, the first encounter I had with\nrefugees was shortly thereafter, some matter of days or weeks. From Munich south, all\nthrough Bavaria were a whole network of underground German factories that were\nproducing goods for the Army, everything from simple bullets to very complicated\nHowitzers. It was all done with slave labor. These people emerged. They were wondering\naround the roads and forests and the lakes. It's heavily wooded area, and heavily\ninfiltrated with lots of small lakes. I used to take trucks out of the motor pool, 9th\nDivision motor pool and start driving on these small country roads looking for people and\ndetermining that they were Jews. The process is very simple, you just drop their trousers\nand that's that. And putting them into the trucks and trying to find a place where I could\ngather them and (a) let them be safe, and (b) get some food in and get some DDT powder\nand get some simple medicines. Penicillin had just been invented but it was ferociously\nexpensive and available only for syphilis. That's when I first encountered them. And I\nremember an episode where we were driving down and we had about a half a load of\npeople and we saw two children on the side of the road, this just remains locked in my\nhead, and I jumped out and I wanted to talk to the children. You talk to them in a\ncombination of German or Yiddish or Hebrew. You find one of those three languages\nwould work. But the kids were frightened. They saw a soldier in a uniform and they\nstarted to run across the field and it's a little boy and a little girl, and they're holding\nhands and they're running and they're stumbling. And I didn't want to threaten them by\nrunning faster than they were, so I kind of followed them and they were gasping and they\nwere crying, and finally they ran out of steam and they stopped, and so I stopped. After I\ngot my arms around them and I tried to explain to them and I pointed to the chaplain's\ninsignia on the uniform which was a little Ten Commandments thing and they quieted\ndown. I scooped up the two kids, they were about 10 or 11 years old, and I scooped up\nthe kids and put them in the truck. But the fear was so palpable. And whatever experience\nthey had been through was so utterly real that they were shocked out of any knowledge of\ntheir own names, where they came from, what they were doing there. I mean it was like\ntotal amnesia. And there was obviously already a medical condition; they could not\nremember their own names. It was the anonymity of those two survivors, they didn't\nknow who they were, what happened to them, where they came from that really impacted\nme. Because I don't understand the six million and I don't understand the one and a half\nmillion children or whatever the number is, but two children that's real, that's real. And I\nsaid to myself, every single one such we have to try to save and rescue. What's dead 1s\ndead. It's all gone. It's ashes, and it's blown off in the wind. But what's living we can't\nleave them wondering around Europe. And that's what I did for the next two and a half\nyears. So I still remember it. So that was the first encounter. And when you would get a\ntruck full of 50 people, then the trick is to find some structure with four walls and a roof.\nSo I remember once we would find a barn that had three walls, and you would find an\nabandoned airfield with a hangar. You would find something. I remember once I found a\ncity hall in a small German town. It was a beautiful building in perfect shape, fully\noccupied by German clerks, all busy working at the typewriters, and I said hey this is a\ngreat building. Well, a Colt .45 is a heavy piece of equipment. You turn it around and hit\nthe butt on the table and you can break the table. So a few knocks like that got the\nattention of the Burgermeister. It was a city hall so he's there, upstairs, second floor. And\nin nice German I told him this house was now beschlagnamt, this was requisitioned in the\nname of the United States Army. I had no more authority to do that than you do, than you\nwould have, but the uniform was its own authority and the .45 was it's own authority. So\nthat, okay, I want this place empty and I want it \"sauber\" and clean and I want it ready\ntomorrow morning and everybody out I am bringing in some \"Fluechtlinge,\" refugees. He\ndoesn't have to know who they are. And, you know, sure enough tomorrow morning it\nwas clean, it was empty, it was available, it was warm. He had some wood in the back for\na wood stove, and 50 Jews had -- now, this is called a camp. I mean you've got to\ndesignate it. You've got a location for it, you give it a name, it's got a population. And to\ncut a long story short by the time we got all through there were 64 locations in Germany,\nanother six or eight in Austria, and even two in Italy, all where the American Army was\nhousing quarter of a million people. The starting number that I was aware of when\nDachau was liberated, that were a few months earlier, was 35,000 Jews alive on German\nsoil either in camp, liberated from camps or from slave labor in German factories,\n35,000. That number was determined by a fellow named Abraham Klausner, a chaplain\nwho was with the forces that got into Dachau right after the camp was liberated.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. It got organized somewhere in a higher echelon unbeknownst to me, probably\nthree or four years earlier because the Haganah organized it and it was called Aliyah Bet.\nAliyah Bet meant --",
        "A: Haganah was the military arm of the Jewish Agency, underground Jewish self-\ngovernment while the British are in mandatory control of the country. So you have an\nunderground government administering the affairs of the population, 600,000 Jews in the\nYishuv, and that underground government had an underground army. And at its height\nthe Haganah had about 25,000 men and women. Just so you should compare it to the\nother two underground organizations, the Irgun which was Begin's organization had\nabout 3,000 people, and the Stern Gang, which was Shamir's organization had about 300\npeople, so that gives you a scale. Now, the Haganah organized two departments to work\noutside of Palestine. One was called Aliyah Bet, which obviously is different what what,\nfrom Aliyah Aleph. Aliyah means migration to Israel or Palestine. Aleph is number 1,\nBet is number 2. Number | is legitimate, legal. It's what the British permitted. The British\npermitted 1,500 Jews per month to receive certificates to enter Palestine. Well, at 1,500 a\nmonth we were going to be many, many, many decades cleaning up what the remnant\nwas in Europe. Therefore Aliyah Bet, method number 2, illegal, was somebody going\ninto Europe, organizing groups of people, sending ships 1n to try to take these people to\nPalestine against the wishes of the British or anybody else who might try to stop them,\nincluding the Nazis. They started earlier in the game. They were taking ships out of\nRumanian port, for instance Constanza on the Black Sea, in '41, in '42. These were efforts\nthat were so desperate and so futile, a few hundred here, a few hundred there, and so sad\nin the ending, many of those ships sunk, many of the people drowned. So that was the\nstart of the whole thing. But when the war ended in '45 the Haganah guys came in to\nEurope in what was for them force, maybe as many as 100, and it might have been 150,\nI'm never sure of the whole number, and they recruited me. That's the \"we.\"",
        "A: Oh, it's a crazy story. I was in a little town down in Bavaria called Bad Tolz and the\ntelephone rings and there is a lady on the phone, and I was 27 years old, unmarried, and\nthis lady invites me to come to see her in her hotel room in the Royal Monceau Hotel in\nParis. So wouldn't you go, I mean under those conditions? When we finally met face to\nface I was quickly disabused of all such ulterior motives on my part and we got back to\ngood old idealism. She said that she had heard what I was doing and she wanted me to\ncome to meet her and she wanted me to -- she wanted to talk to me. That was the phone\nconversation. I agreed. I got orders and went a few days later. The British flag was\nhanging from the front of that hotel. It was right near the Etoile, Avenue Foch. What's the\nBritish flag doing on this hotel? She answers the door, she keeps me waiting out in the\nhall. She says will you work for us. So your question \"we.\" Will you work for us. Who is\nus? She says the Haganah. Now, sometimes in life you make decisions on the basis of\ncareful evaluation of all the fact involved. There were no facts here and you operated by\nintuition. And something told me to say yes and I said yes and it changed my life. She\nkind of went across the room, I'm still out in the hall, but I can see she goes to the door at\nthe far end of the living room. A short white-haired man comes out, walks across. She\nsays to him, Friedman will work for us. He comes over, shakes hands with me, says thank\nyou, turns around and walked out, and I didn't see him for a year. Aside from the fact that\nI didn't know who he was at the moment. So then she said that's Mr. David Ben Gurion,\nand I said who's he. I didn't connect in my mind that this was the Ben Gurion who is the\nhead of the Jewish Agency. He's supposed to be in Jerusalem or in jail in Rhodesia\nsomewhere where they scooped up everybody when the British did that Black Shabbat.\nNo, no she says, that's Mr. Ben Gurion. I said what's he doing here in the British hotel?\nSo she said you never read Poe. The purloined letter is right under your nose, and that's\nthe safest place to put it. Beautiful. So then I sat down and I said okay, and she gave me a\ncup of coffee and I took off my coat, and what have I committed myself to? Okay, well\nwhat you were doing down in the woods in southern Bavaria is fine, that's one thing, but\nwe heed you, you've got to go to Berlin, you've got to get yourself settled there. You get a\nbig house, you get six trucks in the backyard, you get enough gas tickets for a year,\nyou're going to run the route from Stettin up on the Polish border, north almost up to the\nBaltic, way northeast of Berlin, Stettin down to Berlin. I said that's all Russian territory.\nBerlin is an island in the middle of the Russian zone of Germany. She said that's right. I\nsaid we're going to run trucks for 150 miles through the Russian zone, across the Polish-\nRussian border, come down through the Russian zone to Berlin. She said that's it, that's\nwhat you're going to do. I said that's what I'm going to do. She said well, we'll send over\nsome Chayalim, some soldiers from the Palestine Brigade who are on bivouac over in\nBelgium. The British didn't want them to go back to Palestine. These were 30,000 guys,\nwell armed and well experienced in infantry warfare, which by no means did the British\nwant to have in Palestine. So they were keeping them there in Belgium doing nothing. So\nwe'll send you 12 fellows and they'll ride the trucks with you back and forth.",
        "A: A captain in the United States Army, yes sir.",
        "A: Well, I said to her -- she said I don't care how you do it, it's not my business, you get\nyourself transferred to Berlin. If you don't know any of the ropes of your own Army by\nnow then what good are you going to be to us. I mean she was sort of mocking even. She\nsaid don't bother me with these details. I had to get myself transferred to Berlin\nHeadquarters Command. There was one stroke of luck. There was a guy occupying that\npost who was ready to be de-mobilized and go home. His name was Joseph Shubo, an\nOrthodox Rabbi from Boston. And Joe Shubo was just leaving, so I put in an application\nto take his place because we didn't need a chaplain in the 9th Infantry Division anymore,\nwe needed somebody up in Berlin Headquarters Command. The personnel department\nbought it, okay. So I was officially transferred to Berlin. Now, as far as a house is\nconcerned, we found in Dahlem in a very lovely residential section of Berlin a nice big\nhouse relatively undestroyed. The big holes in the roof, we got them repaired. One whole\nback wall knocked out, we fixed it up. This is easy, you know. You pick up craftsmen\nand bricks and cement all inside your own Army headquarters. And I stole the trucks\nfrom the motor pool, that's relatively easy if you want to take the risk. And I stole the gas\ntickets, that's easy if you want to take the risk. And I called her in Paris and I said okay\nsend -- so the Chevrah came over and they lived in the house. It was called the Jewish\nChaplain's Center. On the military side there were 2,000 Jewish troops in the city of\nBerlin in four armies.",
        "A: American, British, French, Russian. Did you ever see that old movie \"Four Men in a\nJeep?\" The patrolling of the city was done with the four soldiers of the four Allied\nArmies. It was called the Allierte Kommandatur, the Allied Command. Okay, and the\nreason we knew what there was because when the Sader came now, the first Sader after\nfreedom was in 1946, Passover, so we started to prepare for it, we wound up having\n2,000 guys in the Schoeneberg Rathaus for Seder, the first Seder in freedom. The same\nbuilding from which Kennedy once came and spoke from the balcony, \"Ich Bin ein\nBerliner,\" \"I'm a Berliner,\" he was sympathizing with the German population. That was\nthe same hall in which we had the Seder. And so there was a big group of troops from\nwhom to draw what I needed which was cigarettes. That's why we called it the Jewish\nChaplain's Center for the Allied Command of Berlin. It wasn't just the Americans.",
        "A: Well, you know, how do they feel about being in Germany? Those who were consciously\nJewish, and that was not all of them by any means, you'd be surprised. Even, you know,\nwe talk about assimilation today, 1992, let me tell you something, assimilation was\nalready beginning to take its toll in 1945. People who were not denying that they were\nJews, but not consciously caring Jews. They didn't have any feeling. See, Germans to\nthem were the enemy. Nazis were the enemy. Germans were exploitable. A carton of\ncigarettes would buy you a Leica camera. A carton of cigarettes cost 70 cents in the PX,\nno tax.",
        "A: Oh, so they were distraught and they were upset. They knew because the Army\nnewspaper Stars and Stripes was printing the whole story of all the revelations.\nEisenhower visited the camp with his chief of staff, Walter Biddle Smith, that's on the\nfront page of Stars and Stripes. And Eisenhower says this is shocking and this 1s awful,\nand there is a long story on the front page, and a long story inside. And the guys who\ncared read those stories and they were constantly in the Army indoctrination lectures that\nthey listened to once every week. They heard everything, they knew it. And the ones who\ncared were distraught. And I used to try to, again do what I did all the time, turn their\nthinking away from the negative and on to the positive because they didn't yet make the\nconnection. And I found that the way that you got them to understand was to demand\nsomething of them. If you don't demand anything of people they don't respond. Nobody\nlines up in the window, at the window, to volunteer. When you do demand, when you ask\npeople suddenly realize there's a sense of discipline somewhere. Somewhere somebody is\nplanning something and needs your help. And that always evokes a response.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, I'm glad you're here.",
        "A: No, good, good, good.",

        "A: The specific thing that I needed in order to keep that operation going, the operation of\nbringing people in from Stettin down to Berlin, the specific thing I needed was cigarettes.\nCigarettes was the currency of the black market, 1t was the currency of choice. A package\nof cigarettes was worth $15.00. A carton, ten packs, worth $150.00.",
        "A: I wasn't buying it. How would you possibly buy it? That's what it was worth. If you paid\n60 or 70 cents in the PX for a carton of cigarettes and you could sell it for $150.00, and I\ncame along and I said to you \"Soldier, I need a carton of cigarettes,\" it costs me one\ncarton per Jew. Now, I'm running six trucks every night, 50 people on a truck, that's 300\npeople.",
        "A: Certainly. To the ones who cared. I got 300 people a night. I've got to pay 100, 300\ncartons of cigarettes, $150.00 a carton, that should be that's $45,000.00 worth of\ncigarettes every single night, every single night. We used to leave Berlin at dusk. It took\nabout until midnight to get up to Stettin, that 150 miles. We loaded in about ten minutes.\nThe Haganah guys on the Polish side of the line had their people all ready, 300 people. If\nwe had 320 we took 320. If we had to throw away the baggage, the poor crumbling\npieces, suitcase, a valise, that mostly had 1n it things like photographs, diaries, what did\nyou carry? You didn't carry an extra pair of socks or underwear. We used to throw the\nbaggage overboard to get three more people on. Kind of ruthless. And then leaving there\nat about midnight, getting back into Berlin by dawn, so this was an operation that took\nplace at night totally. I said now this is what I need, and so you've got to give me a carton\nof cigarettes. I've got to get 300 cartons a night prepared. I need thousands of cartons of\ncigarettes. So if the guy paid 70 cents for it, but he was giving me $150.00 because if he\ntook and he sold that on the black market even for currency, not for a Leica, a set of\nchina, he sold it for currency, occupation Marks, go right over to the Army post office,\nbuy a money order in U.S. Dollars, send that money order home to his wife or his mother\nor whatever to put it in the bank for him, every single week if he didn't smoke he was\nsaving $150.00. So for him to give that to me was an authentic large gift. My father used\nto send me thousands of cartons of cigarettes a week which he collected from his shul,\nfrom B'nai Jacob up in New Haven. And I had the postal inspectors on my doorstep at the\nChaplain's Center because this 1s cash and they want to know what are you doing with it,\nChaplain. And I'd say if you guys find me doing anything illegal with it then you arrest\nme. Until that time do me a favor and don't worry about it. Well, you know there's a\ncertain power of the cloth, you know, that works, and so I took advantage of it.",
        "A: I didn't get the question?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: No, no, no. And I always adopted the -- General Barker was the commanding officer in\nthe Berlin Headquarters Command, American General. I told him. I always adopted the\npolicy of telling the top echelon, the very top of any given Army unit, because if the guy\nat the top knows and if he decides to be mean about it, he can shut you down. And if he\ndecides to be benevolent about it he just passes word down the line to leave you alone.\nAnd the Army is absolutely the most rigid hierarchy in the world and if you turn that to\nyour use.",
        "A: I never said underground. That word wasn't necessary.",
        "A: Well, the conversation by the way was not only with him in Berlin, I'll jump ahead and\nsay later on down in Frankfurt it was with General McNarney who succeeded\nEisenhower, and it was with General Lucius Clay who succeeded McNarney. So all down\nthe line I always went to the top. How do you do it? General, you know about the\nproblem of what Hitler did to the Jews? Yes. You know about the fact that there is a\nremnant of refugees, wanderers, survivors here in Europe?",
        "A: Sure, people who survived Hitler, people who survived Hitler. Every camp that was\nliberated. There were a lot of dead corpses around, but there were people who walked out\nof there alive and they survived. So we used the word then, sure. As a matter of fact I\nused to teach them the Hebrew \"She'erit Hapletah,\" the surviving remnant of the -- now,\nthese people want to go home. The General says yes, well all these displaced persons\nthey all got to go home. There were 10 million of them and the Army is repatriating all of\nthem. Right, General, the Army is repatriating all of them, but there is one group that the\nArmy doesn't know what to do with and that's the Jews because they have no home.\nThey're not going to go back to Poland. If you talk citizenship, that you're going to\nrepatriate people according to their citizenship, if it's a Belgium slave laborer or a French\nor a Norwegian or a Dane or anybody who has been conquered by the Nazis, held as a\nslave laborer you repatriate him back to his original home. Jews are not going back to\ntheir original homes, all of which are cemeteries. So the Army isn't going to repatriate\nJews to remain in Yugoslavia, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, where do all these\npeople want to go? So sometimes the Army guy knows enough to say well, I understand\nthey all want to go to Palestine. And if he doesn't know that he says, well where do they\nwant to go. So you tell him, and then you go off on the Zionist story. The American\nArmy didn't have any more sympathy for the British Army than Britains had for\nAmericans. So you painted the British as the bad guys who were trying to prevent these\npeople from going home, and you depict home as something that every Bible-loving\nAmerican, you're not talking to Jews, you are talking to Protestants largely and some\nCatholics. Catholics are mostly urban and not as well acquainted with the Bible, Biblical\nimpulse, as rural or small town Protestants. And so you've got his sympathy. I never once\nran into an inimical officer of high rank, never once. I've run into them on lower ranks\nwhere I'm not discussing anything with them, but I'm listening to kind of a, you know,\nsort of profane kind of vulgar anti-semitism, but I always discounted that, it didn't bother\nme.",
        "A: And therefore, and therefore we are collecting them. Who is we? Well, there's an\norganization of Palestinians that's collecting, collecting the means. They're moving from\neast. Don't forget that the Russians took hundreds of thousands of Jews eastward as the\nNazi armies moved eastward, okay. The Russians for their own reasons, not altruistic,\nthey're not pro-semitic, Stalin didn't love Jews, but this was maybe a half a million or to a\nmillion people whom he used as labor out beyond the Urals in Central Asia cutting\ntimber mostly, sending back railroad ties. Well, okay, the war is over. Three quarters of\nthem are dead of starvation and hunger and over-work, but there is a good chunk of\nhundreds of thousands. How can I have brought them from as far out as Tajikistan and\nUzbekistan and Turkestan, moving them westward, all the time westward toward where\nthe American Army was in Germany and in Austria. So I said there is an organization of\nPalestinians that is trying to round up these people and bring them together because if\nyou get them all collected someplace you can handle them easier. I mean that's a very\nclear approach to a mechanistically-minded Army General. That's how he thinks anyhow.\nSo I said now there is a whole -- they've come as far west as the border of Germany and a\nbunch of them are up in a town called Stettin, that's the collecting point, and at that point\nthese Palestinian guys can't come into the Russian zone of Germany or the American\nzone of Germany, so there are some of us here who are helping them. Now, if he wants to\nbe really very very GI, well are you doing this at the expense of your Army duties? No,\nsir. No, sir. I'm running my services, I've got 700, 800 guys coming every Friday night,\nevery Saturday morning. Why don't you come over, General, and you'll read the Torah\nportion of the week. And okay, okay, you keep doing a good job. So what are you telling\nme all this for? I said well, look I think you ought to know it because it's happening in\nyour command, in your territory for which you are responsible. There might come an\nepisode where the Russians will raise hell with a truckload of refugees, and you don't\nwant to be caught short not knowing what's going on. Right, good, thanks. I love a guy\nwho keeps me informed. Again, straight Army mentality. So, yes, and that policy always\npaid off. It paid off in hundreds of ways. It paid off with 2,000 calories per day from the\nArmy to every DP in every camp in Germany and Austria. And the JDC Joint\nDistribution Committee brought in supplementary rations of 1,200 so the DP who had\nbeen starved for years, the displaced person, is eating now 3,200 calories a day, great.\nMost of it Army food. And so every night we'd run up there and take our load and --",
        "A: Oh, no. I couldn't go every night, but once a week. Because most of the time I was\nhustling for the cigarettes.",
        "A: The Palestinian guys, the Chayalim, with one driver and one guy running shotgun, so it's\ntwo fellows on each truck, so that's the 12. She said get six trucks. So I have six trucks\nand 12 guys and they were on every night. Every once in a while I get some really gung\nho American sergeant, Jewish guy, and he'd say hey I want to ride the truck. I'd say\nlisten, you know, it's your tachat, and I'm not going to translate that.",
        "A: Yes, your exterior, anything happens, buddy, I can't help you. So he'd come on board,\nyou know, with his carbine or his M-1 and he'd feel that he as doing -- and he was, he\nwas guarding 50 people. Our drivers, we had wonderful, wonderful cooperation from\nJewish guys in the Quartermaster pool. They were all good drivers. Enough good drivers\nso that it was a delight to have them. Well, you know, you run 300 people a night, a\nnight, a night, every night and well we ran almost 100,000 people through Berlin that\nway. But when you bring them in you've got a problem what do you do with them. And\nnot only how do you handle them, but you've got to get them out because Berlin is an\nisland don't forget. So that was all part of the game. We opened two camps in Berlin. One\nwas at Schlattensee out near Wannsee, southeastern part of the city, and one was at\nTemplehof Airdrome, right on the airfield. We had 10,000 people in the Schlattensee\ncamp and 5,000 people in the Templehof camp, so I had places for 15,000 people.",
        "A: I'm getting it from the Gls, I'm getting it from my father, but the bulk finally came in\nfrom the JDC. The first port in Europe that opened up where you could get massive\nshipments in --",
        "A: American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, that's a long name, but the short name is\n\"the Joint,\" the Joint. A marvelous organization, 75 or 85 years old. I don't know how old\nit is. It goes back to World War I. Brilliant professionalism. If I were asked to describe it\nin two words \"Brilliant professionalism.\" No ego gets in the way. No politics get in the\nway. Just plain what is the task, how shall we do it most efficiently and most cheaply,\nand don't use the excuse that you haven't got the money. Define the task, figure out the\nmethodology, figure out the cost and the UJA supplies the JDC with the money. And\nthere never was an insufficiency, there never was an argument.",
        "A: Car loads, freight car loads. Then I was free. Antwerp opened up. The first port ships\ncame into Antwerp. Trains were already working through Belgium up to Bremerhaven.\nFrom Bremerhaven down to Berlin. And I got all the cigarettes I needed. And that's what\nkept it going. My improvisation was at the beginning. But when Antwerp opened and I\ngot in touch with the Joint and they immediately responded.",
        "A: The director of the Joint was a fellow by the name of Schwartz, Doctor Joseph Schwartz,\nand he was working hand in glove with the Haganah who was paying for the whole\noperation. It wasn't just this one little bit of the cigarettes. If you had a hundred\nPalestinian guys, the Haganah back in Jerusalem didn't have any money. The Joint was\nfinancing that whole thing. Throwing 1,200 calories per person per day into the camps\nwas -- in the campaign the UJA campaign in the United States, of 1946, in 1947, more\nUJA money was being given to the Joint for use in the camps among this population than\nwas being given to the Jewish Agency for work in Palestine because the greater need was\nthere in Europe in those two years. By 1948 it shifted and the greater share of the money\nwas going to the Palestine operation, then Israel. So that was Berlin and that was the\ncamp at Schlattensee and that was the camp at Templehof, and then the trick always was\nto organize trainloads to go out of Berlin southward through the Russian zone and come\ndown to Frankfurt which was in the American zone, and go into one of the 64 permanent\ncamps that were in the American zone and there catch your breath and sort out whom you\nwanted to send further south to the Mediterranean to the French and Italian Riviera, both\nof them, where the Haganah ships came in to take the people who were willing to run the\nrisk of the British gauntlet and most of whom were caught out on the high seas in\ncontravention of international law, it didn't make any difference. And the people were put\nby the British on the island of Cyprus which became an end goal in itself because it's\nonly eight hours to Haifa. So the people are on Cyprus and the ship is being collected and\nlined up in the port of Haifa. Now, I never saw it with my own eyes, but I saw a\nphotograph, 57 vessels caught by the British lined up there. They were old tramp\nsteamers, Greek ships and Turkish ships.",
        "A: No, I didn't do any recruiting. And the answer is yes I did speak. There were only a few.\nThere was a fellow who was for a long time a rabbi in this town, in Washington, Eugene\nLippman, a good guy. He was in on it with us. He worked over on the Czechoslovak\nborder, on what we call the southern route. Stettin, Berlin, was the northern route. The\nsouthern route was from a town in lower Silesia, part of Poland, across Nochood, across\nto a town called Klaus?? in Czechoslovakia, to Prague, all the way eastward over to\nabout Bratislava in Hungary, westward back to Vienna, Vienna to Munich. That was the\nsouthern route. Lippman worked the southern route. He was wonderful. Who else was?\nI've got a fellow by the name of Meyer Abramowitz, a conservative rabbi, now retired in\nMiami. He followed me in Berlin. We had closed the route down by then. He didn't have\nthat much to do, but he maintained a large camp population, and later on he moved down\nto Italy to work in camps for the JDC. Married his wife, a DP lady from a camp in Italy.\nSo Mike was in, Mike Abramowitz was in it. Eugene Lippman was in it. Klausner was in\nit at the beginning, not for long, but for a few months. There were another dozen men\nwhose names I don't remember who were demobilized, whom we re-recruited to come\nback because on that southern route, which I described, we wanted to put a chaplain on\nevery train of 1,000 people. A Jewish chaplain riding that train from Prague to Bratislava,\nto Vienna to Munich. All kinds of episodes occurred, all kinds of interferences, all kinds\nof problems, all kinds of strikes from the people themselves, personal problems. One\nauthoritative American Army officer on the train in uniform with his chaplain's insignia\nhad a very sobering effect and a very salutary. So we didn't have the manpower, and the\nArmy called back to active duty a dozen chaplains for a half year and we had the\nadvantage of their services on that southern route. So I have to say they helped. I don't\nremember names. The first three guys I remember very well and very clearly. No, I didn't\nrecruit because there was one, there were two fellows whose names | shall not mention\nwho when I told them that we could use their help and asked them if they wanted to\nparticipate, they gave me such a chicken answer, we are here to serve the Army and we're\nnot going to do anything else, we're not going to get mixes up in this business, this is\npolitical.",
        "A: No, it was a delightful synergy. It was wonderful. First of all it was good cover, and\nsecondly every time I involved Gls in this thing, I was teaching a bunch of Jews about\ntheir responsibility. Come on, it was great. What am I going to do, give them lectures\nabout VD. I mean or go visit in the stockade. I never was very good at that anyway.",
        "A: Oh, come on. I was asked after the Berlin thing by a man whom I mentioned earlier, a\nrabbi by the name of Philip Bernstein who was a key figure. First he was the executive\ndirector, I told you, recruiting chaplains. All right, now we're not recruiting any more\nchaplains, but the commanding general in the German theatre beginning with Eisenhower\nhimself, realized that he had to have at his disposal a person of high stature in the Jewish\ncommunity to serve as his advisor on Jewish affairs. That was the bureaucratic name, title\nof the job. Because you're accumulating now thousands and thousands and thousands,\ntens of thousands of people, problems are going to develop, the Army commander says\nhey give me somebody here who can help me or without saying it, but on whom I can\ndump some of this stuff and I don't want to take the heat for it. I don't want to have the\nArmy get into an adversarial position with these DPs. So there was a consultative\narrangement agreed upon among five major Jewish organizations in the United States and\nthe Department of War that whomever they would designate as a candidate whom they\nall agreed upon, the Army would designate that person, give him the simulated rank of a\nTwo-Star General although he was a civilian and remained in civilian clothes, but for\npurposes of access in the Army Two-Star General puts him up there. You get two cartons\nof whiskey a month from the PX, and you get a certain kind of car, and you get a driver,\nand you can call up anybody and you can say this is advisor Bernstein calling and the\nfellow looks at the list and he sees advisor to General McNarney or General Clay, oh this\nis a two-star guy, well you know, I've got to listen to him. Bernstein was brilliant. The\nfirst advisor was a chaplain, a man by the name of Judah Nadich, a conservative rabbi in\nNew York. He remained with Eisenhower for about three months. Eisenhower went\nhome, Nadich went home, okay. That's when the Army decided it better institutionalize\nthis thing. Bernstein came and stayed, I don't know, a year and a half or something like\nthat. Bernstein gets assigned to Army Headquarters which are in Frankfurt in the IG\nFarben building, a great German industrial combine, huge, huge headquarters building.\nFrankfurt bombed to pieces and this building didn't have a window broken because this\nbuilding was designated prior and so informed the Air Force don't touch it. We've got to\nsave something for eventual Army headquarters, okay. Bernstein's office was two offices\naway from General Clay. I mean literally, couldn't be closer. Bernstein called me in\nBerlin and he said hey listen, I don't know anything about the Army, Major-General\nHeichmoten, that doesn't mean anything to me, I am entitled to a military aid, I need you,\nwill you come down to Frankfurt and be my military aid. And I said I will be happy to on\none condition, that he understood that I have Haganah responsibilities.",
        "A: Well, all Army, at his level, all phones are what are called secure. They're constantly\ntested electronically for taps and you didn't have the kind of surveillance by satellite\nwhere today you listen to every long distance phone conversation in the entire world.\nNSA here listens to every single long distance phone conversation it wants to. If you\nwant to talk to your wife anywhere and you say you don't want your privacy invaded,\nthey say oh well we didn't invade your privacy, I mean the satellite was not working over\nyour district today. I mean let's not get into that. Technology wasn't advanced in those\ndays. So he said well I don't know what that means but, you know, come on down and\ntell me. So I came down because I really liked him. We were intellectually close and\nspiritually close, we were on the same wavelength. That guy was as Zionist as I was from\nthe day he was born. I came down and I explained it to him and he said well that's fine,\nI'm all in favor of that, just don't tell me about it. Because the theory always is if the\nsuperior officer doesn't know or it works on the principle of what's called \"The need to\nknow.\" Phil said, I have no need to know so don't tell me, so then I can't be guilty of\nmaking any mistakes and I won't have to lie or anything. Very good, good arrangement.\nBut anything that was to help Palestine or Israel or the cause was fine. And so, yes we\nwere in DP camps all the time. The DP population we decided should get itself with some\nkind of authoritative, authorized base. What does that mean? There was something in\nexistence which had gotten started right after the war called the Central Committee of\nLiberated Jews, and then there was a huge fight as to the preposition. Liberated Jews of\nGermany, Liberated Jews in Germany. Now, those two words tell the whole ideological\ndifference. So the fight raged and finally they settled on of course \"in Germany,\" right.\nCentral Conference [committee??] of Liberated Jews in Bavaria became broadened as the\ncamp population grew and grew to \"In Germany.\" We then arranged a ceremony in '46\nfor a charter of recognition to be granted by the United States Army to the Central\nCommittee. And the ceremony was held at Headquarters, Farben building with a half a\ndozen of the DPs who were the chief officers of the Central Committee and half a dozen\nMajor-Generals and so forth, and the photograph exists where General McNarney and\nRabbi Philip Bernstein are side by side signing the charter of recognition. Now, that\nmeant that the officials of the Central Committee could travel on Army vehicles, 1t meant\nthat they could -- quarter of a million Jews in the camps.\nAT THIS POINT THERE IS APP. 1 MINUTE OF INTERVIEW MISSING",
        "A: I took him into one camp, yes I was. He was on his way to the Ist Zionist Congress that\nwas being held after the war and he remembered me from the first episode even though I\ndidn't know him at that time. So again I got a call from Paris from his bodyguard, a\nfellow by the name of Mordechai Circus (Zirkes?), who said Mr. Ben Gurion wants to\ncome into Germany and will you get him the necessary pass etcetera, and he wants to\nvisit a camp and you decide where. We had had a very terrible episode at a camp called\nBabenhausen which was near Stuttgart. Let's say either Jews from the northern route or\nthe southern route a trainload of a thousand Jews comes in. And the trainload passed\nthrough Munich and comes up to Stuttgart and the train is on the track and their going to\nbe put in this camp. Now, what is this camp? It's a former Russian POW, prisoner of war,\ncamp maintained by the Nazi Army. As a prisoner of war camp the Nazis didn't care how\nthey treated the Russians so there were no beds, there were no bunks, there were concrete\nfloors with straw thrown on them, and totally encircled by a heavy chain link fence,\nbarbed wire, guard towers, machine guns, heavy search lights, the whole apparatus that\nlooked like a bloody extermination camp. I'll never forget it. The train comes around the\ncurve, many cars, freight cars, the same kind of freight cars that were used, a thousand\npeople on it. They've been on the train now three days. And they're being taken and they\nknow by now through the grapevine that a DP camp in Germany was a place where it\nwas not good, but if you had patience someday the problem was going to be solved, and\nif you kept your hope up. So they were not resisting the idea of going into a DP camp, but\nthey resisted the idea of going into this camp which looked to them like an extermination\ncamp. And the bloody officer who had been told to tear down the barbed wire, take down\nthe guard towers, get some cots in there or some mattresses, none of it had been done. It\nwas a typical bureaucratic slip-up, okay.",
        "A: No, not malice, just ineffectiveness. Sit down strike on the train. We're not going to get\noff these cars. And boy there were enough agitators among them who were exercising the\nright of freedom for the first time to talk about their own fate and they say we're not\ngetting off, and, it didn't take three minutes before that mood froze. And I was there, at a\nnew camp I like to see. When you asked the question before, I was in almost every one of\nthose camps all the time traveling, working for Bernstein out of the advisor's office in\nFrankfurt. I set up a microphone alongside the track and tried to talk to these people.\nNothing doing.",
        "A: Yiddish. Yes, Yiddish. I learned German in high school and in college. By the time my\nparents were married English was the language in the house, by the time I was born. So I\ndidn't know any Yiddish, but I knew good German. And so every time I would appear\nbefore the DPs I would use German. One fine day an episode occurred which taught me a\nlesson. There was a little fellow sitting in the front row and he folds his arms like this and\nI can see he's annoyed. And I can hear him say in a low voice: \"Red nicht kain Deitsch\",\n\"Don't speak German.\" I keep speaking German. A little bit louder he says \"Ich forder a\nYiddish wort\", \"I'm demanding a word from you in Yiddish.\" I don't pay any attention to\nhim. Finally he stands up and he shouts :\"Oder Ihr red Yiddish , oder ich laeuf arois fun\ndannen\", he says \"Either you're going to talk Yiddish or I'm going to run out of here.\" So\nthat taught me a lesson. And I tried to twist my German around and ultimately I learned\nYiddish. So, yes, talk on the microphone to the people on the train in Yiddish and\nnothing doing, nothing is happening. General Keys, a Lieutenant-General, Three-Star\nCommander of the Third Army, Patton's successor, comes out to the track. Nobody will\never believe this story, speaks in English over the -- I translate for him, and they see all\nthe stars and all the fruit salad on the uniform and they know, you know, who he is, I've\ntold them who he is. It doesn't make the slightest -- they were polite but. Colonel Ed\nMartin, the Catholic Chief Chaplain of the Third Army, a full Colonel, comes out.\nNothing doing. Abe Heiman, a Major, the guy on our staff, the lawyer we had. The staff\nwas three of us, Phil Bernstein, Abe Heiman and myself, nothing doing. Okay, the first\nnight they sleep in the train. By the second day they're getting a little hungry. We pass\nfood up and down the train and bring out a whole bunch of Army field kitchens to feed\nthem. I mean that you could do with the snap of a finger. When the Army wants to\ncooperate it's easy. After enormous efforts in which they saw whole bunches of soldiers\ncoming out with wire cutters cutting the barbed wire off, knocking down the towers, they\nsaw it physically with their own eyes, and they realized they were not going into any kind\nof a trap, they dismounted from the train. That was the beginning of the camp. That is not\ndesigned to create good morale thereafter. That's the camp that I decided to take Ben\nGurion to. So I said, Zirkes, you want me to take Ben Gurion to one camp, I'm going to\ntake him to Babenhausen, but you have to tell him that that's a very problematic place.\nThe episode of the initial strike took place some months earlier, but the mood in the camp\nis still lousy, it never did get repaired. So okay, it's all right, the old man has been in\ntough situations before. We come in, there are about 5,000 people in the camp, there 1s no\nauditorium, there is no place for 5,000 people to sit, they're standing in what was the\nstable where the horses were kept, a big huge room like an airplane hangar. There's a\nmicrophone, there is a wooden platform. Abe Heiman and I climb up on the platform\nwith the old man and he stands there, and we introduce him. And there is a loud, cheerful,\nhappy welcome because he, you know, he was a figure. And the camp chairman came up\nand said we want to tell you how we feel and started to talk about the fact that life here is\nnot physically dangerous, but life here doesn't have any meaning, what are we doing\nhere? We are trying to teach the children in the school and we are trying to take care of\nthe sick people and we tried to build a life and we have now our own camp police. They\nhad bicycles and they had whistles and they had arm bands, they kept order. It was a sign\nof independence. We're doing everything we can, but it's all nothing. And so you're\ncoming here today brings us the greatest hope in the world and we hope you have\nsomething to tell us. He stood up and he started to talk about what he was trying to build\nin Palestine and what the efforts were that were being made on the great international\npolitical scene with the British and the Americans the Commission of Inquiry and\nsomebody else. \"Noch a mol a Commission\", another time a Commission of Inquiry, who\nneeds it. You know, we got a little heckling from the audience. But he tried to explain\nthat there was a major push on in historic terms to get a state created and a free\ngovernment to which they could come. But he wasn't going to offer them any immediate\npanacea, and he wasn't going to offer them any immediate results because he would be\nkidding them. He talked firmly, he talked beautifully, he talked honestly because that was\nhis strong, his forte. He wasn't a manipulative politician. He was an ideologue. He had\nhis own ideology, but he never tried to say anything to give people false illusions, false\nhopes. When he got through there was silence, no applause. And finally he said \"Listen, I\nhave no certificates in my pocket for you, don't you understand that? But I am telling you\nthat I do bring you hope. Now, let's sing the song of hope. I want to hear Hatikva.\" He\nhad a monotone and he couldn't sing. I have a monotone, I couldn't help him. The crowd\nslowly started kind of a crackling, crack, off key, but it began to build, it began to build\nsome momentum and then it came out into full burst and there was a big singing of\nHatikva by which time he was crying. And that was the end of the meeting and he walked\noff and he was shaking his head. And we got outside, got in the car, he said \"My God, I\ndon't know what's worse, people being burned up in the camps or people waiting 1n these\ncamps without hope. I don't know how to say which is worse.\" And then years later I read\nin his, you know, he wrote voluminously in his diaries, and I want to read here, I have\njust one paragraph, and I don't want to take his words. This is what he wrote \"The people\nof Babenhausen finally understood that their unloved camp was not the end of the line,\nbut a way station on the road to freedom. The distrust and bitterness I had faced that day\nin October gave way in December to patient hope.\" December was the Zionist Congress\nin Basel in 1946. So he sensed the mistrust, he sensed the bitterness, he sensed\neverything, he understood it, but he said he believes that he gave them hope that their\nstay there was a way station on the road, it was not the end of the road. And he and I for\nyears after that, we saw each other very often in the course of the whole UJA career and\nthe course of the years that I lived in Israel after that, and every once in a while he would\nget a glint in his eye and he would say let's talk about Babenhausen. Sort of a symbol to\nhim, the way station. So, yes, we used to go to visit lots of the camps and there were lots\nof problems and riots and Jews breaking out of camps.",
        "A: Yes, that's what we concentrated on. We tried to concentrate, we tried to build up a sense\nthat (a) there was a large group who cared, a group of institutions and individuals who\nand which cared for them, there was somebody caring for them, there was somebody\nlooking after their welfare, there was somebody trying to take care of their immediate\ndaily needs, and somebody trying to build a future for them. And that was the basic\nmessage and we reinforced it all the time by active conduct. The Jewish Agency would\ngive us a Singer or a piano player or somebody. I remember a lady, Paula Padaney, a\ngreat pianist, and put her on the circuit and send her through 30, 40, 50 camps, as much\ntime as she could give us. We did all kinds of things. The Agency sent over about a\nhundred school teachers. It grew even to more than that I think. And we put Palestinian\nschool teachers in the schools which were organized in each camp to keep the kids busy.\nYou did everything you could and you kept publicizing through the camp newspaper\nnetwork every time a ship would go so that -- there was a dreadful thing called the Va'ad\nAliya, the Committee on Immigration, I call it dreadful because it was operated according\nto the Zionist political key.",
        "A: You know, okay. This Mafteach, the key. Depending on --",
        "A: And with every reason to be flip about it or to be more than sarcastic. I called it dreadful.\nIt was not a humane way of handling this, it was a purely political way. The committee\nhad on it representatives of every Zionist political party. The committee fought\nferociously that if a ship had room for 600 people each political party fought for its share\nof the 600 berths. No consideration of women and children first okay. That doesn't go\nanyway because you don't want to separate families. No consideration for family need. I\nmean we knew the populations in each camp so intimately. We never treated them as a\nmass, we always treated them as much individually as possible. So it would be very easy\nto know if there are 600 places, give us the 600 neediest people in camp A, or give us 100\npeople each from six different camps so you'll build a moral in six camps that indeed the\nships are going and maybe someday they'd get on a ship. There would be ways of doing\nit. No, the political key operated. Namely, each party argued what it's relative strength\nwas and demanded the number of berths on that ship according to its strength. My party\nis 13 percent of the Jewish people, I want 13 percent of the seats. If you ask him who he\ncares about, he didn't care about the individuals, give me 13 percent of the seats because\nwhen they get to Palestine they're going to be voters for his party because his party took\nhim out of Germany.",
        "A: The needs were simply spiritual and non-material. They were psychological, spiritual and\npsychological. The people needed to believe that they would not be in these camps\nforever, that this wouldn't be the end, that there was a different end. Now, they knew that\nthey could always be repatriated back to their original land of citizenship. All they had to\ndo was say to the Army, hey, I'm Hungarian so send me back to Hungary. That's not what\nthey wanted. So they were waiting, waiting, waiting. Now, they're not hungry, they're not\nin danger, their medical needs are cared for, so what do they need? They need an\nuplifting of the spirit. They need belief and confidence that there would be a successful\nend.",
        "A: Well, there was always some number. And HIAS at that time, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid\nSociety, was responsible for taking to America those who wanted. And some small\nnumber went to America, but the number was really very small. I don't know how to\nquantify it. HIAS every once in a while, some every few months, there would be a ship\nand the trans-Atlantic vessels always had room for 1,200 people, 1,500 people. So I don't\nknow, if there was a ship a month you were talking about 15, 20,000 people per year\ncompared to the large number. I say I can't really quantify it, and I don't know if anybody\nhas got a statistic.",
        "A: Oh, Palestine. Listen, Palestine, you talk about if you recite the Schmona Ezrei every\nday, if you do, then you're talking about rebuilding Zion and rebuilding Jerusalem. I\nmean it was bread into the bone from these people who came out of the small towns and\nvillages of Eastern Europe. And even the sophisticated ones from the bigger cities had\nsome memory of that tradition. I'm not saying that there was a lot of religiosity in formal\nsense of that word. Yes, there was a synagogue in every camp and there was a rabbi in\nevery camp, and he took care of second marriages which were very frequent, people who\nmarried during those three and a half years in the camps, but you're not talking about a\ndevout, you're talking about skeptics as far as religion is concerned. Belief in God, where\nwas he, and maybe, and you know. But the ethnic and the folk traditions, the memories of\nholidays and the memories of food and the memories of basic prayers. So they were all\noriented toward rebuilding Zion. If you recited the blessing after meals, in the blessing\nafter every meal, if you said it, 1s the \"Benei Yerushalayim\" etcetera, \"in our day\nquickly.\" So that was their orientation. I remember once there was a camp outside of\nFrankfurt called Saosheim and Eleanor Roosevelt came to visit. She stood up there and\nshe was trying, she was kind of a good rabbel rouser, she always could get the crowd to\nrespond to her. She thought that awakened the crowd out of any lethargy. That's the way\nshe explained it to me later. We became friendly. She said \"Perhaps you do not want to\ngo to Palestine, perhaps it takes too long, perhaps the British don't--perhaps you'll lose\nconfidence, you'll lose faith in it. Do you really want to go to Palestine?\" You know, the\nway the question was phrased was in order to evoke that massive roar. But she couldn't\nhave evoked it if they didn't feel it. They were almost homogeneously, almost\nunanimously zeroed in that that was the only future they had.",
        "A: Leave Europe, let me think. Let's see, there was the Exodus. No, no, I left before the\nExodus. The Exodus sailed in, I think 1t was September, I'm not sure, but I think it was\nSeptember '47, so right before that, August, July, summer of '47.",
        "A: Why did I go home. A very interesting story. Professor Scholem, Gershom Scholem from\nthe Hebrew University in Jerusalem had come to Germany. We got a pass for him.",
        "A: Jewish mysticism, a German Jew by origin, intellect to the nth degree, a warm Jew, loved\nto be in Israel, was not against his will, he was not dragged there unwillingly. And he\ncame on a mission in the uniform of UNRRA, United Nationals Relief and\nRehabilitation. So strangers who came in on specific jobs will have to be in uniform. It\nwas a military empire there. So he wore an UNRA uniform and he had a 90 day permit\nand he was working in a warehouse in Offenbach across the river from Frankfurt where\nAlfred Rosenberg, the philosopher of the Nazi movement had collected several million\nvolumes --",
        "A: Okay, another tape, right.",
        "A: This is a great story.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: The other thing besides the Talmud story is the story of the Kielce Pogrom, that's a very\ncrucial story.",
        "A: Crucial story. Okay.",
        "A: But we're past it 1n point of view of time.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: He received permission to come into Germany to visit and work in the Offenbach depot\nof approximately 3,000,000 volumes which Rosenberg had collected. The intent of which\nwas to form a basic library of Judaica which German scholars would study and find in the\nvery Jewish sources the words with which to condemn the Jewish people as being\nparasites and destroyers and anti-Christ and everything else so that you would condemn\nthe Jewish people out of their very own mouths. What came out of their mouths would\ncondemn them. But somebody had to find it and collate 1t and synthesize it into one\nsimple volume that then would become the property of every single decent person on\nearth. And after we have killed their bodies we will then also kill their soul and their\nspirit. So this was the intention of Alfred Rosenberg and this was the process. Now, what\nwas collected, literally actually collected physically, in that warehouse were mostly claye\nkodesh and repetitious forms of the same prayer book in different languages.",
        "A: Holy books, the holy books. But among that mass of 3 million fairly unimportant\nvolumes, from his point of view, there were 1,300 priceless incunabula, manuscripts\nhandwritten from early Middle Ages and Scholem worked for 90 days like a beaver, slept\nin that same warehouse, sorting out 3 million volumes and had these 1,300 precious,\npriceless, irreplaceable items set aside. He packed them into five large wooden packing\ncrates, each five feet by five feet, not impossible to handle, not gigantic, and labeled\nthem. And that's where the fear started. Because a couple of days before his time ran out\nhe came to me and he said what are we going to do. I have applied for permission to take\n* \"Claye Kodesh\" are literally holy utensils.\nthese to the Hebrew University, the monuments and fine arts section of military\ngovernment in Germany of the American Army, monuments and fine arts section, has\nrefused me permission. They're the ones who allowed me to come and do the sorting.\nThey now refuse me permission to take these to Palestine. And at first they wouldn't give\nme an explanation for that refusal, and then I finally pushed and I got it, and the\nexplanation was that there is a rabbinical seminary in New York, I'm not sure of the name\nof it, I think it's the Theological Seminary which says that there is no reason why all of\nthese precious things should go to Palestine. All of them or some of them should be\nplaced in our library, the greatest Jewish library in New York, the greatest Jewish\npopulation in the world. This is a clear reflection of the absolutely indifferent or neutral, I\ndon't want to say anti-Zionist position of the seminary. I don't even want to say the whole\nconservative movement in 1946. And I state this publicly and it can be interpreted as a\ncondemnation. I'm not trying to condemn anybody, I'm trying to say that they had a letter\nfrom the chancellor saying, and that had to be I think at that time, Finkelstein, that the\nArmy should not allow, they should not send all these documents to Palestine. They had\nbeen collected from all the locations in Europe whose descendants are either dead or have\nmigrated to the new world. So that was their sort of cool, cold objective reasoning. The\nArmy didn't want to get into an internecine Jewish fight so it put a hold on it. And he was\ndistraught because his time was up, could not be renewed, and he didn't know what to do.\nHere he's got the stuff in five packing cases and what does he do with it. Again you have\nto make a decision at a certain moment in time and you make it, and I said Professor, go\nhome, relax, don't worry about it, I'll steal them, I'll get them out of the warehouse and I'll\nget them to you, and don't ask me how because I don't know yet myself. I was sorry that\nhe had labeled them because what was happening in Germany at the time was a very\nactive black market in pages of Beethoven and pages of Mozart, and one page was\nbringing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Much later on when the story finally broke on\nthe front page of the Stars and Stripes, and I can show you the issue which I have kept to\nthis day, it listed the value of this treasure as $5 million. He went home. What I did very\nsimply was on New Years Eve when it everybody was off duty or drunk I took a JDC\nambulance, drove it to the back loading dock. There was a Jewish captain in command of\nthe warehouse, his name was Benkovich, he was from some place in Texas, Jacob I think.\nI said listen turn your head the other way, I'm going to sign for these as though I am a\nman by the name of Koppel Pinson who was no longer in Germany, he had gone home\nfour months earlier --",
        "A: Right. And he worked for the JDC, the Joint, and he had permission to draw from that\nwarehouse in Offenbach books to be distributed through the camps to any children's\nschool or camp libraries that wanted any of these books so long as the officer in charge of\nthe warehouse certified that they were not irreplaceable, that they were just common\nordinary books. So Pinson had the authority to sign to draw stuff out. I signed his name,\nput my initials underneath his name. He hadn't been in Germany for four months already.\nBenkovich concurred with me, conspired jointly with me, and I said turn your head the\nother way and I'm going to take the boxes. So I took them out in the ambulance, they just\nfit. And I hid the ambulance until such time as I could get the boxes on to a freight train\nto Paris where I intended to go to 135 Avenue, Wagram, which was the Office of the\nJewish Agency, give them the boxes and say hey, deliver to Scholen. They refused to\ntake them. They wouldn't have anything to do with it. But they gave me a tip that did turn\nout to be useful, they said that Chaim Weizmann's library was being shipped from\nEngland to Palestine and it was stopping in the port at Antwerp and I could get my boxes\nof books on to the ship and mix them in with his boxes of books. They would get in to\nPalestine probably without being recognized. The British didn't care about this. This was\nWeizmann's library and Scholem's name is a professor, it was on the outside of the boxes\nso it would go okay.",
        "A: That's the same gentleman. He lived in England for decades and had accumulated a\nmarvelous library there and at this point in his life decided that he wanted to get it\nshipped over to Palestine. An antecedent, precedent to his eventual move himself. So the\nthing was neatly executed, neatly done, and I went off on a short leave to Denmark\nbecause I wanted to see Hamlet's castle. And a few days later I came back and found two\nCID guys sitting in my office waiting for me. CID, Criminal Investigation Division of the\nUnited States Army. Very nice, sympathetic, friendly guys, not threatening, but very\nfirm. And they said listen, Chaplain, you are now under investigation seriously. This will\nlead to general court marshall. We would just like to tell you that we have you dead to\nrights, but what we really do is we need your confession, that's all. Now, here is your\nsignature on the paper your signed to draw the boxes out. Here is the number of the\nambulance of the JDC which you used to transport. Here is the number of the freight car\non which you loaded them and on which you slept overnight from Frankfurt to Paris in\nthe boxcar with the boxes. Here is the number of the truck you used to go from Paris to\nAntwerp. So, you know --",
        "A: -- what are you kidding about now, so would you just sign this please and then we'll get\non with it. I went to Bernstein. I stalled them and I said well listen, come on fellows, you\nknow, I mean this 1s like a bombshell, I don't know what you're talking about, I haven't\ngot any idea what this is all about, so let me try to rock it and sleep over on it and, you\nknow, I'll meet you tomorrow. I went to Bernstein and I said you remember our principle\nof need to know, well I think this one you need to know, and I told him. Without any\nmore ado he picked up the phone and he called General Clay. We're two offices away. He\nsays General, I've got to come in and see you about something, and Clay always took him\nin immediately. And it worked so well for us all the time normally. And he told Clay and\nthen he brought me in and Clay looked at me and he said why did you do it? I said\nbecause I didn't want the stuff to get stolen and lost a second time. Those boxes wouldn't\nbe secure in that warehouse, somebody would rip them open, somebody would see the\nstuff, somebody would recognize it. An antiquarian would be approached, the stuff has\nvalue. And it was lost once. Its owners are gone. The Jewish people collectively is\nconcentrating in Palestine. Palestine will be free one fine day. These should be in the\nNational Jewish Library in Palestine, that's the successor, inheritor of all this stuff. That's\nwhy I did it. He said I have to ask you a formal question, did you have any intention ever\nof diverting any of this to your own use and selling it for your own. I said no. He said I\nbelieve you. He knew me reasonably well. He said well, all right then here is what I'm\ngoing to do. I am going to order that the boxes be brought back here because I am not\ngoing to get into a fight with the seminary in New York, and I am going to let the\nmonuments and fine arts section decide on the distribution and that's the Army way. I\nsaid, sir, for God's sake don't do that, don't subject them to another voyage. An airplane\ncan go down, a ship can go down, they are irreplaceable. Don't do it. There is an\ninventory, Professor Scholem has it, he knows what he put in the boxes, there are 1,300\nitems. Have the boxes opened in Israel in the presence of any authority you trust. There's\nan American Councel there attached to the British Headquarters, take somebody, an\nAmerican, a military or non military, have him stand there as the boxes are opened and\ncheck the inventory, and then leave it there. If you want to leave it for future eventual\ndistribution, good. I'm not going to argue with you about that, but leave it there, don't\nmove it. So he looks at me, he said yes possession is 9/10ths of the law isn't it? Once it's\nthere it's there, isn't 1t? I said, sir, don't get me into that discussion. So we immediately we\nhad an understanding. So he said okay, it's a very reasonable suggestion. So ordered, and\nI will so organize it. Now, what do we do about you? I mean this is a long answer to your\nquestion about what provoked my leaving the scene. He picked up the phone, called head\nof the CID, said I want you to kill the court marshall, that's out and over, I'm sending this\nofficer back to the ZI, back to the zone of the interior. That's what the United States was\ncalled as far as the Army overseas. The United States is the interior. So this officer is\nbeing dismissed from my command and will be discharged from the Army and so you\nkill the court marshall. Finished just like that. And he came back from the phone and he\nsaid, and the boxes will remain there, are you happy, he said. Perfectly satisfied. Now, it's\nbetween Scholem and your surrogate, whoever your person is over there in charge, and\nI'm satisfied that it will work out the way we hope it will. So I was given orders to go\nback and be discharged. That story ended. I went to Fort Dix in New Jersey and the\ncustomary procedure there is that when you're being discharged they ask you a bunch of\nquestions, have you returned your gas mask, have you returned your rifle, blah, blah,\nblah. And one of the questions is, do you wish to remain in the United States Army\nReserve Corps retaining your commission and advancing in rank. So the Sergeant who is\nreading all of this to me, you know, he's doing it by rote. All of a sudden he stops\nhimself, do you wish to remain and he said oops, he said that doesn't apply to you. There\nis a note here that you are not authorized to remain in the Reserves, you are out. That's\nhow that ended. That was after being four days in the stockade for a whole other story\nbecause Morgenthau. Henry Morgenthau who was the head of the UJA said I need you to\ngo around with me making speeches in America and you've got stories to tell that will\nhelp raise a lot of money. And I said but I have to go to Fort Dix and be discharged. And\nhe said well, I'll call the Secretary of War and I said no, sir, call the Ist sergeant at the\nseparation center and he said I don't deal with sergeants, I deal with cabinet members. So\nI said well then get something in writing. He did indeed call Secretary of War Patterson,\nwho told them over the phone yes you want to keep this man with you 30 days,\nabsolutely, in uniform on detached service to you, I'll write the orders. I never got a copy\nof the orders, Fort Dix never got a copy of the orders. I had gone back 30 days later and\nI'm arrested at the gate for being AWOL, absent without leave, and the Chaplain of all\npeople to be absent without leave, I mean how can you do this. It took me four days to\nconvince them to give me a dime and let me make a phone call. And then the\ncommanding officer, general somebody, was told by Morgenthau yes I had the man on\nduty with me and I will get you a telex from Secretary Patterson and you'll have it in ten\nminutes, this guy came back to me in the cell, he gives me a cigar and he says don't hold\nanything against me. I said come on, come on, you don't think I know the racket well\nenough. No, of course it's not against you, it's against stupid Mr. Secretary Morgenthau,\nhe didn't get me anything in writing, the Army goes by what's on paper. The end of the\nstory in Israel, in Palestine was the American guy witnessed the opening of the boxes,\nagrees that not a piece 1s missing. They nail the boxes up again and they take them up to\nMount Scopus to the library. Now, we are talking about 1947, okay. In the war in 1948\nwe lose Mount Scopus, don't we? So the boxes are up there now once again in jeopardy.",
        "A: Originally.",
        "A: Was lost to Jordan.",
        "A: Okay, so this Israeli contingent, 140 men, were allowed to inhabit a trench between the\nAugusta Victoria Hospital on the one side and some other marker on the other side which\nwas on the apex of the hill on the top of the ridge. And these 140 guys were a symbolic\nIsraeli presence to validate Israel's previous ownership, and hopefully ultimate future\nownership, and it was one of those cockamamie arrangements that was part of the\narmistice treaty and this group of 140 men sat up there for two weeks and played cards\nand twiddled their thumbs, couldn't do any training, couldn't do anything. They were in\nthe trench. It was dreadful duty. You could only keep them up there two weeks. Every\ntwo weeks they came down under supervision of a UN convoy team which escorted them\ndown the hill to the UN truck at the bottom which took them away and replaced them\nwith 140 other guys who stayed up there for two weeks, so there was a rotation, okay.\nThe end of the story is that it took several years for the 1,300 items to come down, one by\none by one, tucked under the shirts and jackets of the rotating platoon. And every piece\ncame down finally to: \" Sof hadavar\": At the end of the story. And Scholem had the\nprivilege of putting them all in the rare book room of the new campus at Givat Ram, what\nwas then the new campus. I don't know what it is now. And I saw him, the last time I saw\nhim was a couple of years ago before he died, and I said I have to make sure. I saw a\nstory once in the Jerusalem Post by Abraham Rabinovitz who wrote the story telling\nabout the bringing down, did it all work out, did you really get them all in the end. He\nsaid every last one. And we shook hands and that was the end of the story and it was the\nlast time I ever saw him. So that's what happened to the books, that's what happened to\nme, and --",
        "A: Yes. I went back to Denver, the original congregation. I went with Morgenthau who was\nthe chairman, and then I went with Edward Borger?. For the next several years, let's see,\nthis is from '47, for the next eight years, the next eight years, I was a volunteer chairman\nof the Speakers Bureau for the National UJA and I was out three or four days a week,\nMonday through Thursday. I got home for the weekend, Shabbat. Anybody wants to get\nmarried we collect all the people and we do it on Sunday. Anybody wants to die better do\nit on Sunday. By Monday I'm off again and running. And eight years. Twice in that\ninterim they came and asked me if I would become the professional director of the\norganization and I turned it down. But then after a while Mr. Warburg and Mr.\nRosenwald who were the two ranking chairman of the of the UJA, both from those\naristocratic families they really said look you must do this, there is nobody like you,\nnobody has your background, nobody has your experience in the United States, not only\nwhat you did in Germany, what you have done here, the public knows you now in every\ncity in the country and you know the leading big givers in every city in the country,\nyou've been talking to them as a volunteer, now become our professional head. And there\nwas a big shuffle, a long story, I don't want to get involved in that, about the bonds and\nthe newly organized bond organization of which I was one of the founders and fully\nagreed to and didn't see why there should be any fight in any community between the\nUJA and the bonds, and that was a very precious attitude to have because so few people\nhad it at the beginning. At the beginning there was dreadful fear and competition. One\nlay leader sticks in my mind as a man who rose above it and that was a man from\nBaltimore by name of Joseph Meyerhoff and he said, he was marvelous, he said the way I\nwill prove this is that I will be the chairman of the UJA drive in Baltimore and I will be\nthe chairman of the bond drive in Baltimore and I will do them both in the same year and\nI will separate them so that they don't impinge on each other, and he was role model\nnumber one of what a good lay leader should be. And we trotted around the country\ntogether for years, he and I. And his son now is the Chairman of the Council of the\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. So the bond organization needed somebody to run it, and\nthe UJA organization needed somebody to run it, and the big boys in Israel got into the\nact because this was, we're talking heavy money, so Eshkol got into the act, Menachem\n[Nahum?] Goldmann got into the act.",
        "A: Later Prime Minister. And then Menachem [Nahum?] Goldmann was President of the\nWorld Zionist Congress following Chaim Weitzman.|[?] [Nahum Goldmann was\npresident of the World Jewish Congress] So when the heavy weights got in and came\npressing on me I really couldn't say no. I shifted in the interim from being the rabbi in\nDenver to being in Milwaukee, and they came to Milwaukee and they spoke to the board\nand they said you've got to release this man. So they did, and I did and that was it. Then I\nswitched over from being a volunteer to being the executive, the CEO, of the UJA, and\ndid that until the '70s when we left and moved over to live in Israel for a period of years,\nwith every intention of remaining. Got diverted because of some family illness and\nwound up back here.",
        "A: It's really a serious question and it's easily answered. The DPs lived mostly in camps.\nThere were no machine guns aimed at them and there were no guards at the gates, but\nthey were in an encircled area, they were in a camp. A few of them were out and were\nliving freely in rented quarters among the German population, they were comfortable\ndoing that, but 99 percent were in camps. They used to look through the wire around the\ncamps and they used to see Germans going on buses, carrying little briefcases, going to\nwork. The town was working and everybody was living a normal existence except they.\nThey hated the Germans. They resented them. They didn't envy them. They just would\nlike to have torn every German apart if they could get their hands on them. Now, they\ncould because as I said they were not confined, they went out into the towns near which\nthese camps were located. They bought goods in the German stores. They learned to\nspeak German, many of them did. But you could see the look in their eye and they hated\nevery German. Every once in a while some episode would flare up and you would see the\nexpression of it in a physical form of rebellion. And I'll just tell you one story which\nillustrates many many similar things that happened. It was in the camp at Landsberg.\nLandsberg was the town where Hitler was in prison. In that very same German Army\nbarracks in which he was imprisoned in 1925, yes, '24, '25 when he wrote \"Mein Kampf,\"\nare now living Jewish displaced persons. So you can imagine what an irony that was.\nOkay, in this camp at Landsburg one day a rumor spread through the camp that a Jewish\nchild had been kidnapped and killed by the Germans. Immediately a riot started through\nthe whole camp, and a wave rushed out of gates of the camp into town and started to\nbreak store windows, start buildings on fire, over-turned buses, attack and pummel any\nGerman passerby, quickly the town turned into an armed camp. The purpose of the Army\nwas to keep law and order. Here it was breaking down between Jews and Germans, okay.\nThat's dynamite, that's incendiary. So the Army pushed the Jews back into the camp and\nclosed the gates and padlocked them. Okay, now you have U.S. troops ringed around and\na couple of 50 caliber machine guns are brought and set up and a tank is hovering\ndelicately in the background but present, visibly present. And so the Jews start yelling\n\"Amerikanische SS, you American soldiers are acting like the SS. Amerikanische Nazis.\"\nWell, now the lieutenant in charge of this platoon says whoa, whoa, we're not Nazis and\nwe're not here to hurt you, but you can't come and tear and town, and the dialogue goes\nand the Jews boom!, burst out of the padlocked camp once more and break the gates.\nThen the scuffle starts between American troops and Jewish DPs and Germans ringing\naround looking at it with great pleasure, okay.",
        "A: 19 young fellows get arrested. They were the ones at the front. So they were the activists,\nand one of them has a knife in his pocket. Later when they're arrested and they are\nbrought into the police station and one of them has got a piece of lead pipe in his pocket,\nand one of them has got a hammer in his pocket, and anything that could be used as a\nweapon, okay. So they are charged with, I don't know what the technicality of the charge\nis, but it's disturbing the peace and it's inciting to riot, and nobody was murdered and\nnobody was killed. By then incidently it is discovered that the little boy who was missing\nwas not dead, that there was a hole in the fence at the back of the camp going right into\nthe woods, and he had gone out there and he had wanted to do whatever, maybe he\nwanted to smoke a cigarette, nobody knows, but nothing had happened to the kid and the\nkid had came back in. And so the whole rumor that had started the whole thing was of\ncourse inaccurate. But by now you've got 19 fellows in the stockade. Word of this gets\nback to the United States. There was a Congressman from Illinois by the name of Adolph\nSabboth, an old guy, he was about 80 years old. He informed the press and the\nDepartment of War that he intended to go to Germany and himself make sure that these\nJews got an honest and fair treatment from the American Army and the American Army\nwasn't going to treat them like the Nazis did. And he's shaking his fist in everybody's\nface. And of course word of this gets back to General Clay and this is exactly what he\nneeds his advisor for, so General Clay says to me you go down to -- Bernstein says to me\nyou go down to Landsburg, you sort this thing out, you make sure that these guys get a\nproper defense. They're in front of a court marshall of seven officers, so it's going to have\nto be a military officer who will have to defend them and there will be a military\nprosecutor, and I want you there as my personal representative. And you have all of my\nauthority and you report to the commanding general that you are there on my behalf so he\nknows who you are and you follow this thing every step of the way because this is\ndynamite. Okay, the end of the story very quickly, I went to the Judge Advocate General\nand I asked him for the best lawyer he had in the United States Army. And he tells me\nthat guy who handles all death sentences given by courts marshall for murder, rape, all\nthe felony one kind 1s a captain by the name of Abraham Heimann, and I say fine, I want\nhim. Heimann said if I get mixed up in this DP business I'll never get home for five years.\nI'm due to be demobilized. I said Abe, come on, come on, come on. And to make a long\nstory short he came on and he came down and he was the defense attorney and he\ndefended them as well as he could and brilliantly.",
        "A: He did not. He wound up as the last, the final advisor when Ferinwald?, the final camp,\nclosed in 1950 Heimann, the last advisor, went home finally in 1950. So anyhow, the trial\nended. They were given three months which was, you know, the admonitory slap on the\nwrist with time off for good behavior. So they probably might have served, you know,\nthree weeks, four weeks, something like that. However, Heimann pleaded and obtained\nfor the right that they should not be put in a prison with Germans, they should not be put\nin a prison with American soldiers in the stockade, they should be put in some separate\nplace where the Army can have a few guards and watch over them. And we find an old\nabandoned castle nearby, quite nearby, so their families could come and visit them, and\nwithin four weeks we had all 19 of them out and on their way through the Aliyah Bet and\nthey were taken off Marseilles to a ship to Palestine and that was the end of that.",
        "A: Oh, Kielce, the Kielce Pogrom, is that the one you're referring to? Oh, that was a bitter\none, bitter, bitter, bitter. 42 Jews were killed that day and the bodies were laid around the\nfountain in the center of this little medieval looking village, a beautiful little village, and\nthe bodies were like cord wood in a circle around the fountain. A ripple went through all\nof Europe, and of course it reached Germany and it reached Army Headquarters. And\nGeneral McNarney who was the commander at that moment said to Rabbi Bernstein, take\nmy airplane, go over to Warsaw, go to wherever you have to go, find out what's going on\nthere, find out what caused it, find out what it's implications are, and what the\nconsequences might be, if any, for us here in Germany. Because he knew, he was\nsophisticated enough to know that this was going to trigger off another flood of people\nleaving the east and trying to cross the border into Germany where they would be safe.\nWe did, we went. Unbelievable. We went to see the American Ambassador whose name\nwas Arthur Bliss Lane. There was only one hotel in Warsaw, and the Polonia, and it was\nhalf smashed. And he had two rooms, the American Ambassador had two rooms in this\nhotel. That's all he had. No embassy. And he had gout and his foot was up on a hassock\nand he was mean and he was miserable. And he said listen, this has nothing to do with\nme, don't talk to me about these Jews and what happened in Kielce. It's not an American\nproblem, it's not an embassy problem, it doesn't involve anything, it doesn't involve a\nconsular division, it doesn't involve reparations, nothing. And probably whatever\nhappened to them they damn well deserved. That was his parting shot. Thank you, sir,\nMr. Ambassador, very much. We went to see the Prime Minister, Mr. Edward Losupka\nMorafska. Quite bland. I really, you know, there is some latent anti-semitism among the\nPolish people, everybody knows that, that's historic fact, I don't know what triggered if\noff, I don't know what caused it, but it will die down the way it always does. And I mean\nthere is nothing that the Polish government will or can or should do about there. There\nare no culprits, we can't find anybody. We go to see the Cardinal, Augustus Cardinal\nHlond, H-L-O-N-D, a bull-necked, cropped hair, tough as nails. He never asked us to sit\ndown, the whole interview was standing. And his attitude was very simple, these Jews\nbrought Communism here. The head of the Communist party running this country is a\nJew by the name of Yacob Berman. Whatever the Polish people of the town of Kelts did\nto those Jews they did out of anger and fury and rage because the Jews have put this\nanchor around our necks. And the church will do nothing. We tried and we asked him if\nhe would write a pastoral letter which should be read in every church and this would kind\nof put a blanket on the -- he wouldn't do it. So our fourth visit we went to Mr. Berman,\nand Yacob Berman says if the Jews are guilty of having brought Communism here to\nPoland it's the best thing that we could ever do for this country and I will take whatever\nconsequences. And furthermore, if the consequences are that a few Jews get killed, well a\nfew Jews get killed. It's just a few more. We are fighting for a whole new world. And he\nwas a Communist idealogue and he believed it and he preached it. And we're fighting for\na whole new world means for everybody and for a larger number of Jews, and even if\nthere were a few casualties there always are in war. And the last point I want to make\nwith you gentlemen is that they should remain here. If you came from Germany from the\nAmerican commander to find out if the Jews here are going to flee, if I have anything to\ndo I will see to it that they will leave this country nakt und barfuss, they will go out naked\nand barefoot because they shouldn't go out. Well, you know, this was zero for four. We\nhad seen four people, the Ambassador, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal, and then the\nCommunist leader, and you get no sympathy from any of them. But then when we started\nto go around and we began to talk to the Haganah guys who were working in the towns\nand we began to talk to ordinary Jews whom we were recommended to, we got the\npicture that they're packing and leaving. And we returned and we wrote the report to\nMcNarney that he could expect, that the military command in Germany could expect\nover the period of the next year to a year and a half approximately 150,000 people to\ncome flooding in from the east to the west. And the Army had better gear up for it and\nprepare it, and the Army would have a political decision to make, not a military one as to\nwhether the borders should be closed or opened. And if you want to close the borders and\nyou want to try to prevent these Jews from coming in then you're going to have to do it\nby armed force or setting up barriers and blockades. McNarney looked at that and he said\nwell, whoa, this is way over my head. Bernstein, go to Washington please and talk to the\nPresident. A decision about whether the border of Germany is open or closed to 150,000\nrefugees is not for me to make. So Phil did, he flew to Washington and talked to Truman.\nIt took about 15 minutes. He got an immediate green light, and he came back. Okay,\nMcNarney has got a green light from the President, the borders are open. So Lippman is\non the Czechoslovak border and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the borders are all manned\nwith our people and that is what raised the ultimate total to 250,000 people. It's just as\nsimple as that. That was the final result of the Kielce Pogrom. Those 42 victims triggered\noff a major demographic shift. And the accumulation of that many people in the camps in\nGermany itself had the political influence plus the episode of the Exodus to produce that\nvote in the United Nations in November of '47. By November of '47 everything is falling\ninto place.",
        "A: I don't remember the latter date where I was. I was probably -- no, I was still in Denver in\n'47. Of course, I was still in Denver. I was in Denver November 29th '47. May 15th '48 I\nwas shuttling between Denver, New York and Wilmington, Delaware. Wilmington,\nDelaware had to do with DuPont. New York had to do with the Haganah headquarters 1n\nthe United States which was in a hotel, 14th East 60th Street. Next door to the\nCopacabana nightclub. The director of the Haganah in the United States was Mr. Teddy\nKollek, now the Mayor of Jerusalem, a world famous figure. So Teddy had ordered me\nwhen I returned to the States, he reminded me that I was still in the Haganah and never\nmind I was running around making speeches for the UJA, that's kid stuff. As far as the\nHaganah is concerned it's real stuff, and he wanted me to, contrary to the embargo laws\nof the United States Government, to buy, pack, ship out of the United States all the\ndynamite, brick production, of DuPont. A brick is a brick, the size of a brick, the size and\nshape of a brick, but this brick is a piece of dynamite. Now you take three of them, stack\nthem up one on top of each other, and take three more, one on top of each other, and wire\nthe six of them together and attach the wire, whatever length you want, to a detonator and\nyou blow up that package, we called it a satchel charge because you took the six bricks,\nput them inside of a knapsack, you know, a canvas GI knapsack, it looked like a little\nsatchel, it should have been called a knapsack charge more accurately, and it will blow a\nhole in a stone wall or it will blow a hole through an iron gate. And that was the main\nartillery that the Israel Armed Forces had. It didn't have any big artillery, it didn't have\nmortars, Howitzers. So I was buying the dynamite, shipping it to myself in Denver, trans-\nshipping it down to Tampico in Mexico, buying vessels, getting the stuff on board in\ncardboard cartons that said \"Del Monte peaches, fruit salad, pineapples.\" We stole the\ncartons from Del Monte, California. And the ships were manifested to the Far East, but\nwhen they went out of Tampico they didn't turn and go through the canal to the Far East,\nthey went to the Mid East, in the other direction. So that's where I was all through '48. '48\nwas a hell of a year with me and the FBI. But everything came out okay. No charges, no\nnothing, and a happy ending to the story.",
        "A: No, Michael. No, I think we've covered the main things. But the summary of the whole\nbusiness is that you had a population that had the patience and the stamina to overcome\nall of the evil and the agony they had been through, all the losses they had suffered, and\nwho had the hope and the faith in something they believed in that represented their\nfuture. So the patience and the stamina, the faith and hope characterized that DP\npopulation. With all the hatred boiling in them, with all of the stuff that many of them\nhave never gotten out of their systems for their whole lives, that's one element. Then\nyou've got the other supporting elements. You've got the group, you've got the United\nStates Army, benevolent, friendly, cooperative. I can't compliment them enough. Number\ntwo, you've got the group of American Jewish organizations that came in with dough and\nsupport. Number three, you've got the Israelis, the Palestinian personalities beginning\nwith Ben Gurion himself and the whole mechanism of the Haganah and their support that\nthey provided. And then lastly you have won over world public opinion so that you get\nthat great ringing majority vote of two when the resolution was finally passed in\nNovember of '47. It won by two. The two countries were the Philippines and Guatemala,\ngreat big Democratic powers that pushed the ball over the line. But that was the\ncombination. Now, we've talked about the DPs themselves and we've talked about the\nArmy and we've talked about the JDC and the great organizations. We've talked about the\nHaganah and the Israelis. The world conscieuce, feeble as it was, did its trick and the\nState was created. And I sum that whole thing up when I think of myself and my life and\nwhere I am now and what did it all mean, I really believe the following statement, and it\nmay sound strange to you, those three years from 1945 when the war ended until 1948\nwhen the State was established, those three years I think are the single group of any three\nyears in the entire history of the Jewish people, and I mean every single thing I can think\nof that we've been through since Abraham, I don't think there is another period of three\nyears which has ever been so determinative. Because we came out of the death into the\nlife and those are the two extremes, death and life. There aren't any others. There is\nnothing similar. Persecution and inquisition of this one or that one, or running from one\ncountry, running from another country, that's all blips on the screen. But this is the\ndefinitive thing. We could have passed off the stage of history. There's no doubt in my\nmind about it. One third of the people dead in Europe, one third of the people paralyzed\nand ineffective in America during the crucial years, almost another third of the people\nlost behind the Iron Curtain, you couldn't get to them, they couldn't be useful or helpful.\nThe Jewish people almost died, I mean totally and finally and irrevocably. And out of\nthat three short years later you find you're back into vibrancy and action and you're\nwinning a war. That's a miracle. I don't know any other miracle, and I'm even talking\nabout the crossing of the Red Sea, and I'm talking about anything else you want to\nmention, I don't know of anything else that's comparable to it. So if I had the zekhut, the\nmerit, to live through those three years, work my way through those three years, add\nsomething, well then it was a life worth living. And that's how I sum it up.",
