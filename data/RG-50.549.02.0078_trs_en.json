        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby\nHerr collection. This is an interview with Lucie Rosenberg, conducted by Neenah\nEllis on April 16\", 2004, in Washington, D.C.. This interview is part of the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post Holocaust interview project, and it\u2019s a\nRosenberg within the last five years.",
        "Answer: Yes.",
        "Q: Not sure of the date. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. When your video interview ended, you summarized a little bit\nabout what happened to you after your family came to New York. But I\u2019d like to go\nback and talk a little bit more specifically about some of the things that happened to\nyou and your parents and -- when you first arrived there. And y-you mentioned in\nthe -- in your interview that your father went into the mustard business in Brooklyn.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And tell me a little more about that, how did that come about?",
        "A: Well, he and two other people, one, a man from Belgrade who was actually an\nelectrical engineer, and a man by the name of Rolf, who was a Polish refugee,\ndecided that they had to do something and this was apparently available. At one\ntime my father had a -- wa-was in something -- I won\u2019t say -- s-say [indecipherable]\nbut in the alcohol business --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and in a vineg -- he had a vinegar factory in Liublyana. So, he had some notion\nof -- of this -- of a very little. And so they were there, I think my father -- I\u2019m not\nquite sure what year my father sold it out, but it was very traumatic for him, I must\nsay. And particularly negotiations with the union was quite funny.",
        "Q: So these three men pooled their money and bought an existing business?",
        "A: They bought an existing business, yes.",
        "Q: What did they call the mustard?",
        "A: They actually made mustard for various well-known mustard firms, I -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t tell you -- I mean, there were various brands and so on. The thing was called\nOld Dutch mustard company. And as I said, they -- they -- th-they -- I guess they\ngot the labels and the -- and the -- the -- the -- what would you call them, the\ncontainers and so on and they did it for various companies that I don\u2019t remember\nthe name of, but they were certainly better known than the Old Dutch mustard,\nright?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And they did that for roughly how many years?",
        "A: Sic -- I\u2019m trying to think. Maybe five, maybe s-six, and -- I mean, my father\nbailed out very soon afterward, he couldn\u2019t stand it. He couldn\u2019t stand it, he also\ncouldn\u2019t stand driving to Brooklyn daily, and so it was --",
        "Q: Did he go into another business after that?",
        "A: No, I think he mostly invested in real estate and by that time we had already\ngotten -- he -- he\u2019d started working on -- on this project of getting -- getting the\ncompensation from the Yugoslav government and so on, so --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- no.",
        "Q: Can you explain that a little bit, the compensation?",
        "A: Yes. The royal Yugoslav government had deposited in the United States a\nserious sum -- I mean a serious amount of gold, I guess it must have been ingots, or\nwhatever you called gold. And after awhile the Tito government wanted to --\nwanted to get this gold back to Yugoslavia and United States said yes, after you\nhave compensated United States businesses that were there pre-war, and s-some of\nour -- an-and our citizens, American citizens whose -- whose property was\nnationalized. And, as they had nationalized a number of things, number of\nbuildings, number of factories and so on [indecipherable] Yugoslavia after the war.\nWe -- we were within this particular group of people. And this went on for several\nyears and finally -- finally a lump sum came, and then I guess mostly he -- he -- he\ntraveled a great deal, he -- actually he did the trip around the world with some\nfriends, and --",
        "Q: And you were in this group of people because of the businesses that he had?",
        "A: Also my -- no --",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: -- no. Simply because, for instance my -- my -- my mother\u2019s house, which is\nright in the center of Zagreb, supposedly very historic, it was built by her great-\ngrandfather. In fact, this was built -- when this house was being built, Jews were\nstill not allowed to have property, real estate property in Zagreb. But by the time it\nwas finished -- so it star -- it was built under the name of the architect, was a very\nfamous architect by the name of Felbinger. And by the time it had been -- so this\nwas known for years it was a Felbinger house. But by the time the house was\ncompleted, this law had been passed in Austria-Hungary an-and they could, you\nknow --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- own the property.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So this was extremely valuable property because it\u2019s in the very center of the\nmain square in Zagreb, and there\u2019s a great deal of -- of -- of -- I mean, this 1s a\nsmall, this is a two story, very old pa -- I mean, house. But the back 1s very\nvaluable, let\u2019s say like something on Times Square, it -- just the main square in\ntown and so --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: -- just the land itself is extremely valuable and there was another house in the\nback and so -- so that was one of the things and also my father had -- had some --\nano -- some more real estate property in Zagreb and other odds and ends, and --",
        "Q: So he got involved in this compensation negotiation?",
        "A: Yes, ye -- well, not really. I mean, yes, he -- he did, I mean, he and a lawyer and\nso on, it took a great deal of time and cu -- and he had to travel to Washington a\ngreat deal and so on. But this was done through a lawyer here who -- who -- whose\nname I don\u2019t re-recall right now, but was an American lawyer who dealt with this\nand with numerous oth -- not too many, but other people who had arrived about the\nsame time we did, and some a little earlier. Not many who arrived later, because\nfirst of all there was this cut-up -- cut off date and secondly we arrived just -- we\ncrossed the border from --from Austria to Switzerland on the day that the -- the --\nthe -- Belgrade was bombed, so you know, if we had been caught we would have\nbeen obviously in bad shape.",
        "Q: An-And was your father successful in that? Did he get his money?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was serious money at the time. I don\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t remember what -- what\nthe amount was, but it was a lot of money.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And when -- when you were first in New York, you mentioned that you\nwere doing some translating and some research at the library --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- when you met someone who was affiliated with broadcasting. It was the\nprecursor to the VOA. But can you talk a little bit about your life when you first\ncame as a young person and -- and who were your friends and what did you do and\n-- and were you happy to be there, were you -- you know, what -- what were your\nprospects? What did you --",
        "A: Yes -- yes -- yes, I was very happy to be there because -- 1n a way, of course I\nwas sad, because as soon as we started getting news of what was going on, it was\nvery painful. But -- but there was a lot of hope still going on. There was a\ngovernment in exile which was [indecipherable] that was in -- in -- in London and\nthen came back into the United States. We th -- both my brother and I thought this\nwas really fun. We arrived in New York and we stayed in a -- in a -- a what do you\ncall it, an apartment hotel, it was da -- it was on 57\" and Sixth. It was called The\nSalisbury, it was like two or three rooms and a little kitchen in a closet, and a -- and\nof course, you know, they cleaned up and gave you the -- and gave you fresh\nlaundry and so on and there were pa -- I think there were two bedrooms and some\nkind of a living room and so on. And I remember going to a five and 10 cents store\nand we bought all of this crazy china, very cheap stuff, and like four plates and four\nspoons and so on. And it was sort of like playacting almost. Nobody was aware of\nreally what was going on and how it was going to happen. There was -- we knew, of\ncourse, that there were Jews being taken to concentration camps in Austria and\nGermany, but there was no talk of death camps, and there were none at that time, I\ndon\u2019t believe. And so, we were there. Also, at the same time, this gentleman who\nwas in the mustard business with my father, who was from Belgrade, he -- they\ncame -- no, they may have arrived just a little earlier than we did. There was a girl\nwho was about, I don\u2019t know, two, three ye -- two years younger than I am, and a\nboy who was maybe a year or two younger than my brother. And it was fun. My\nmother didn\u2019t have the faintest notion about cooking. This very nice Mrs. Shanser\ntaught her to cook. By that time we had moved to a nice furnished place in river --\nin Riverdale in New York. Do you know where that is, across from [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No, I -- mm-hm.",
        "A: -- but anyhow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s almost on the border of Scarsdale and well,\nWestchester county, or whatever. And they had this very nice apartment building\nthat had a bus taking you to the -- to the subway if you wanted it, several times a\nday, and to the little grocery, to -- to shopping [indecipherable] was where my\nmother used to go with this friend who was teaching her how to cook. And\nhowever, when we got there, we discovered that there really -- we didn\u2019t have\nenough knives and forks and we couldn\u2019t function very well with whatever we had,\nthese four spoons and so on. And that place did not have any tablecloth or any -- it -\n- it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually, the furniture was quite nice, and it was large\nand quite pleasant. So then my father went to an auction in New York. And this was\na extremely sad thing that I\u2019m still -- that is still terribly painful to me. He went to\nthe New York docks, wi -- where there were numerous cra -- not crates, what you\ncall the -- what do you call these things that you send large amounts of furniture,\nhousehold goods?",
        "Q: Containers?",
        "A: Contains.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay. And for non-payment of fees at the dock, these things were auctioned off.\nSo he didn\u2019t really know what -- what was in it, but they would say, I don\u2019t know,\nchina and silverware and odds and ends and so on. And he bought this almost sight\nunseen -- in fact, sight unseen stuff, which then was brought home and I still have\nit, but this -- now it\u2019s going to go [indecipherable]. Very, very elaborate -- if you\nwant I\u2019Il show you the thing because it\u2019s kind of amusing -- china, which was\nobviously bought by a family that was moving to the States with you know, what\ncan we buy that -- that -- of German goods that I -- we\u2019re permitted to take out and\nso on.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: So this is just a lot of gold and a lot -- I'll show it to you -- thing, which we used\nfor everyday use. I think we were cutting things and so on. I mean, our -- our china\nat home was very nice china, but it wasn\u2019t elaborate, I mean was -- it was okay, it\nwas --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- It was a -- we -- we thought this was really fun, both my brother and I. And\nthen one day -- there\u2019s all sorts of stories about it -- one day somebody said, do you\nknow how much this stuff is worth? I said, absolutely no idea, I mean, this is what -\n- yeah, this is what we use. Although we thought it was quite funny that it was as --\nas -- as elaborate as it was. So finally we decided okay, we need to do -- put this\naside. However, later on we did use for slightly better stuff, slightly better\noccasions, this china. And one day -- by that time the government in exile had --\nfrom Yugoslavia, had left London or some parts of 1t and were in London -- were in\nNew York. And as ours was really just about the only family --",
        "Q: Intact.",
        "A: -- intact, and you know, we didn\u2019t live in a -- in a hotel, all of these guys whose\nwives were left either in Zagreb or in Belgrade and whatever, would congregate and\ncome and have coffee with us and -- and kugelhupf and things like that. And by -- I\ndon\u2019t know, this wasn\u2019t at the time, yet maybe it was, that Albina Padovan had\ncome from -- no, I\u2019d -- I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t think so. Anyhow, we were having, I\nremember as today, there were about five or six various ministers of one kind or\nanother. One of them was the minister of -- of the post office, who was a -- who --\nwho -- who had gone to the -- to a -- to a Franciscan seminary, but who became the\nminister of, as I said, of the post -- of post offices in th -- and was a friend, very\nclose friend of my father\u2019s from childhood days. So he was there, and then there\nwas a guy by the name of Gavrilovic who was a -- who was the Minister of Finance.\nHe hadn\u2019t a been, but I\u2019m -- I think he was pre-war, pre -- pre-war, I think he was\nthe -- a congressman in Belgrade. That was Gavrilovic. And there were several\nothers. And then there were some people, some refugees who had meanwhile come\nfrom Belgrade and -- via Cuba, which was another way that people were coming in.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And they got into -- and I had -- this was at the time when there was a\nparticularly horrible story going on with Draza Mihailovic and -- and -- and -- and -\n- and Tito. And it was at the time when the Germans were killing every 10\" child or\nevery 10\" male in one of the cities. And I remember coming back from work and\nthey\u2019re s-standing there and suddenly they got into a horrible fight. One was with a\ncake knife and the other had his -- had the -- a chair, trying to ward off -- I -- I don\u2019t\nremember who was doing what. One of them fainted, and my mother and I just\ndisappeared into the maid\u2019s room and locked ourselves up because we didn\u2019t want\nto be part of this whole story. And in the process one -- one of the cups got broken.\nSo it\u2019s not an absolute --",
        "Q: Perfect set.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] set. So -- so, you know, we must have been -- this wasn\u2019t an\nunusual thing, they were there a lot of the time and so that necklace, one of the\nthings. And then when we opened this -- this case with the set -- with -- with -- they\nhad between it, and I may still have some, little flannel dividers with embroidery,\nhand embroidery around tt.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: You know, it -- it was just --",
        "Q: Heartbreaking.",
        "A: -- heartbreaking. It was awful.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t even think -- this became heartbreaking later to me, th-this -- this was\nstill all in the process, okay --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- so you know, maybe they\u2019re somewhere else. We didn\u2019t know yet what really\nwas going on.",
        "Q: Yeah, and did -- these men were coming -- you knew what was going on,\nbecause you were in touch with these people whose lives and livelihoods were very\ntied up with what was happening there.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: So you were on the edge of --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- knowledge.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it the assumption at that moment in time that you were gonna go back? Was\nthis a temporary situation for you?",
        "A: It was a temporary situation.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: It was so much a temporary situation that I actually thought when I was --\nmarried Morris, that he was going back on his job and I was going with him. And\nthen he had to resign and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Well, you\u2019re jumping ahead a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So your -- your -- your mother and father were assuming that we will maybe stay\nhere --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- til things blew over and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- maybe -- maybe a fe -- years, but --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- we\u2019re going to go back.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me about your job, this job that you got.",
        "A: The job was the -- the organization at that time was called coordinator of\ninformation, and Elmer Davis was the head, the director and whatever you would\ncall it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And at that time I guess there was some broadcasting going on, but I had very\nlittle to do with it. What I did was, I was in something called the media analysis\nsection and with me it mostly consisted of sitting in the public library in New York\ndoing research on the number of speakers of [indecipherable] or -- or -- or -- or\nSerbian or whatever. But I remember mostly it was African and -- and -- and -- and\nAsian languages. I wasn't terribly good at it, but anyhow I did do it. And then this\nmo -- merfed -- morphed, is the word, morphed into a -- into the -- first 1t was called\n-- this was only called va -- as I said, coordinator -- coordinator of information and\nthen it became -- it wasn\u2019t still Voice of America, forget what it was called. It was -\n- that was an in between thing. My husband was in the same building and I didn\u2019t\nknow him at all.",
        "Q: And this was in New York?",
        "A: This was in New York, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There wa -- there -- there was broadcasting going on mostly from London, and\nthere was a man who was a Serb who had lived -- a Yugoslav, but he was a Serb,\nwho had lived in Paris and had been doing broadcasting 1n a very interesting way.\nWe always listened to him in Zagreb, pro-allies and so on. And as the French -- he\nfinally got evacuated and left -- and ended up in New York and continued\nbroadcasting from -- not Voice of America, but what was the pla -- I\u2019m trying to\nthink of what it was called, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t was - 1t was not yet Voice of America, it\nwas coordinator of information. Office of War Information --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, of course, right.",
        "A: -- was what it was called, yeah, okay. So within the Office of War Information,\nthen we got Voice of America. Morris was in a totally different thing and I didn\u2019t\neven know he -- he existed. So this Serbian broadcaster ended up in New York.",
        "Q: Was this Petrovich?",
        "A: Yes, it was Peter Petrovich. How did you know that?",
        "Q: From your other interview.",
        "A: Aha.",
        "Q: You me -- you mentioned his name, yeah.",
        "A: Okay. So s -- Peter Petrovich, who was quite -- I mean, he was very royalist and\nso on, but at that time there was nothing else. I mean, they a -- we just had started\nhearing slowly that there were two movements going on in Yugoslavia. So anyhow,\nI at -- I was -- my job was translating -- I think he -- I don\u2019t know whether it was a\n15 minute broadcast or longer, half hour, it seemed endless, I\u2019Il tell you that. I was\ngiven -- he would -- he would provide a script. And I had to translate that script and\nthis all went into broadcast control or whatever it was called.",
        "Q: From Croatian to English?",
        "A: From Serbian to English, right.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t speak English, or he didn\u2019t -- he would read it --",
        "A: First of all he didn\u2019t speak English, but certainly he wouldn\u2019t have bothered\ntranslating. I mean he was -- he was something of a -- of a star. And he probably\nwould have been bad anyhow. I was -- I was employed there, okay, what are we\ngoing to let her do? At that time I think I was working for something called the\nBalkan section that was being run by a -- first by an Albanian, and then by a Greek,\nthere were no Yugoslavs in left or right, except for me. And I translate at -- at the --\nget this material and -- and in -- I would get it maybe the night before, I\u2019m not quite\nsure. Come in in the morning, I would trans -- I would read it and then I\u2019d translate\nit and I would -- this was then submitted and then he would do his thing. So one day\nhe got very sick, he got pneumonia, but they didn\u2019t want to stop the broadcasts and\nhe didn\u2019t want to stop the broadcasts. And he wrote the fine scripts and I translated\nthem and I voiced them, saying that I was doing this, you know, in the name of, and\nit always ended with long live his highness, kin -- King Peter of Yugoslavia, along\nwith the -- Draza Mihailovic, I mean, that whole event. So --",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to see how we\u2019re doing. Okay, we have a couple more minutes.",
        "A: So this -- this -- this was it. So then finally a section, a Serbo-Croatian section\nwas sSe-set up and a very nice person by the name of Milan Hatzuk, who was a --\noriginally from Zagreb, but who had worked as a journalist in Belgrade for awhile.\nAnd I don\u2019t know when he came to the States, I think before we did -- who was\nthere and got the job. He was not an American citizen yet, but almost. All of us\nwere, you know, sort of -- nobody knew what was going to go, we were we -- some\nof us were -- of course, I mean, I -- I was about to become an American citizen, I\nhad, you know, first papers and the works --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- and so on, so I had very little problems, but we had to be supervised by an\nAmerican and that was it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And there were -- yeah, yeah, which I thought was fine.",
        "Q: Yeah. Was it -- w-was it fun work? Did i -- did you really -- did you like it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you feel a sense of --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- importance in -- 1n it?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Then they had a women\u2019s program finally.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Which was kind of fun, which I th -- which I actually heard from friends who\nhad heard that I was [indecipherable]. I always felt that it was pretty stupid stuff\nbecause -- because, you know, people really did expose themselves. They could\nhave been killed for listening. This -- this was -- this was a very funny thing. This\nwas done -- some of them I did, but they weren\u2019t very interesting. I mean, some\nsuggestions they had, fairly boring. [indecipherable] I used supposedly for interest\nfor women. It was very hard to find any -- whoever was at that time I think was a\nsecretary of -- of labor, a woman in the States [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Perkins.",
        "A: Perkins.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And a number of things of that kind. You know, you tried to do something that\nwasn\u2019t really just stupid, and did it. And this was -- this was beamed to BBC. And\nthen BBC several hours later would -- would beam it --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- to Yugoslavia. And as I said I heard from friends who had heard me and so on,\nalthough I didn\u2019t go by my name.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: What name did you use?",
        "A: Sorell.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: S-o-r-e-l-l. So then -- which is the name that my brother then --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] And this was kind of fun. It was am-amusing because I would\ncome to me -- I would come home and then I would turn on the BBC, I could hear\nmyself several hours later, but at that ti -- you know, and then we had these things\nof -- of -- of dictation speed because of sunspots.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t broadcast --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- at a normal speed.",
        "Q: Very slow, yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] very slowly and then there were things that had to be in -- there\nwere some things that were worthwhile. You would -- you would broadcast, you\nwould hear, for instance, when there was some kind of important action back, or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And you would have reference to it so that they would know that one knows here\nthat this is going on [indecipherable] business.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Let me turn this tape over.",
        "A: Sure.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: So the na -- the nature of these broadcasts that you were doing, even though they\nwere women\u2019s programs --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- you would somehow weave into them war news?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Because you weren't allowed to directly broadcast war news? Can you explain\nthat situation, or what --",
        "A: Not really, because I -- I think it was mostly intimations of -- you would say the\n-- the brave fighters in such and such a place, that so on, so on, one is aware of it, or\nsomething like that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Th-There were intima -- there wa -- there was no direct stuff.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So finally tha -- I mean, this was part of the stuff that I was doing. Meanwhile\nthere was a very nice Yugoslav desk that was set up that had a Slovene, a -- the --\nthe head of the desk, who was this very nice guy from Bel -- originally from\nZagreb, but then later in -- who was a journalist in Belgrade, his name was Hatzuk.\nAnd then there was a very old lady and she seemed even much older than that. She\nwas the mother of a very famous ballerina here, by the name of Pasha Mira. And --\na Yugoslav, bu -- good, I mean, well-known. And she had been the wife of what\noriginally was the [speaks foreign language here] which would be the director of the\nmain Zagreb theater -- well [indecipherable] let\u2019s say th-the equivalent of the\ndirector of -- of the Kennedy Center, because everything took place there, drama\nand comedy and -- and everything. So, very old lady, who had been in the States for\nawhile, and she was supposed to be translating and she was not very good. And then\nwe did future stories of unbelievable boredom to me. And then other things and y-\nyou used to have -- of course you -- you had a headline thing, and then you had a\nfeature and then you had another feature and so on. So for awhile I was -- I was the\nannouncer of, you know, I was the in-between person, you know, you have ju -- you\nhave heard Voice of America, huh?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay, that kind of business. And -- and I was translating. I was doing a little bit\nof writing and I was doing a lot of translating because whatever we did -- this was\non ditto paper, have you ever seen ditto paper? It was ab -- obnoxious stuff that was\nblue, here. And you would type on that and then this was taken to some kind of a\nmachine and that was --",
        "Q: Oh right, yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Copy paper.",
        "A: And all my pants and everything that I wore was blue. Underwear, everything\nwas -- you couldn\u2019t get -- nails. Terrible. Then a very nice woman -- okay, excuse\nme. [tape break] What can I tell you? [indecipherable] Okay, so then a very nice\nwoman by the name of Mary Vucedic came in. Mary Vucedic had been working for\nwhom I had met in Zagreb, who was a few years older than me -- not quite a few\nyears older than me, who died recently in New York, who was married to a Croat,\nwho worked as [indecipherable] a Croat aristocrat, Lemaniti Vucedic, who\n[indecipherable] her to the n\" degree and finally she got divorced. And then we --\nyou know, we went through all of these terrible things. Her father was killed in a --\nin Rome in one of the prisons in Rome, in [indecipherable] was that big -- can you\nimagine giving that name to a -- to -- to a prison? Okay. So that\u2019s where he was\nkilled. He\u2019s an older gentleman. Her mother survived and I don\u2019t know how, she\nwas a very unpleasant and very demanding German Jewish person. Then there was -\n- finally we got somebody by -- by the name of Robert Rosenberg, who had been in\nthe U.S. Army. How he got there, from Tusili in Bosnia, he ended up in the United\nStates Army and was -- I think he got TB or whatever, he was demobilized. And he\nappeared in our midst and we were told, this is a veteran, you give him a job\nwhatever he does. And I will not say that he was -- he was illiterate, but he wasn\u2019t\nvery good either. He was no intellectual. And he -- but, he spoke absolutely\nclassical, beautiful Croatian, which he spoke [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: All of those nice places in Bosnia, I mean, gorgeous. And all of us sort of had --\nZagreb does not have a very nice dialect. And although you spoke standard Serbo-\nCroatian, 1t comes through, you can tell where people are from. Then there was a th\n-- this -- our boss spoke Serbian, although he wasn\u2019t a Serb, but he had lived in\nBelgrade for many times. Then there was a Slovene who had his own broadcast and\nhe tried to keep as far away from us as he could, and -- and --",
        "Q: S-Some things never change.",
        "A: Some things never change. And -- but he -- he was okay. But as I said, wa -- then\nthere was somebody, a middle aged Croat, he seemed very old to me at that time, by\nthe name of Gospodin Katosic. And he later became the head of the desk because\nHerzog decided to join Encyclopedia Britannica films, and did that. Which was very\nsmart. And this went on for awhile, and always the same stuff and so on. Very -- not\ninteresting at all, but very hard. And then later there were various young men that\ntook me out. One, you know -- and I\u2019m just thinking of what -- there was somebody\nby the name of Duncan McDougal junior from the -- from way up in the mountains\nof North Carolina, whose a great, great -- actually, he was th -- my first boss when -\n- in the media analysis section. And he knew a great deal about jazz, so he would\ntake me to the village [indecipherable] and all of these nice things and taught me a\nlot of stuff like that. And I\u2019m just thinking now, two o\u2019clock in the morning he\nwould put me -- and I never thought anything about it, nor did my parents, on the\nsubway in New York, I would go all the way to almost the Bronx there, and then I\nwould take a shuttle bus to the house and it would be three o\u2019clock in the morning\nwhen I came to work, and 1 -- nobody even thought that this might not be very\ngood.",
        "Q: Mm. Mm.",
        "A: That\u2019s how safe New York was.",
        "Q: Yeah. Hm.",
        "A: And then I had a very wonderful friend there whose husband -- whose second\nhusband ma -- later became the Polish ambassador to the United States, and he was\nin the U.N. with a very high job, and he was am-ambassador in London and so on.\nAnd she and I would walk through Central Park West at 11 o\u2019clock at -- I mean,\nthrough Central Park at the -- in the middle of the night, from 47 -- I mean from --\nwhat was the address on Broadway and a -- and -- and 57\" Street to her place, she\nwas somewhere near, I don\u2019t know, 72\u2122 Street and who knows where on the West\nSide.",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you met your husband there?",
        "A: Yes, in a strange way. He had come on leave and he came to tell us he was\nworking for -- well, it wasn\u2019t e -- it wasn\u2019t Voice of America, and wasn\u2019t -- well, 1-it\nwas OWI in a way, but it -- they were attached to OSS, I believe, and so they were\nin uniform, these guys.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Anyhow, and he --",
        "Q: Don\u2019t ask him, don\u2019t --",
        "A: No, no. And he came to tell us how w -- how our broadcast works -- were --\nwere -- were deemed by the Serbs, by the locals one way or another, what we\nshould do one way or another and so on. By that time I was engaged to somebody\nvery funny by the name of Raven McDavid, junior, whose father at the time was the\n-- what was he -- was -- he was -- he wasn\u2019t the governor of South Carolina, but the\nfirst one under, what was the name of it?",
        "Q: Lieutenant governor?",
        "A: Yeah, Lieutenant governor. And I had gone there to visit and -- and I was taken\nto [indecipherable] to meet the governor and so on, I was very embarrassed\n[indecipherable] was terrible. Anyhow, I was enga -- I was -- I was --",
        "Q: You were engaged.",
        "A: I was engaged. I had gone there with my uncle, officially, to Greenville, South\nCarolina and so on and I didn\u2019t even [indecipherable] the assembled guests at this --\nit wasn\u2019t a banquet, it was serious dinner with the na -- with the guys ex-nanny\nserving with white gloves still, around, and then after the dinner he drove her home\nto her place. It was a very strange thing. He was a very good scholar, he was an\nexcellent scholar and he married somebody at the University of Chicago and I\u2019m\nsure this was much better than anything he could have had with me. Plus, my\nmother couldn\u2019t stand him. Okay, and anyhow I was -- I was going to marry this\nguy, and then, you know, Morris turned up and we -- we were both thinking we\nwere going to go back together to Belgrade, he knew a bunch of people, you know,\nhe kept mentioning, that I had known there. And told us what we did right, what we\ndid wrong and then we started going out and we thought we were going back, and\nthen of course it was impossible. I couldn\u2019t and he -- he quit because I couldn\u2019t go\nback and then he started working -- or no -- or -- or -- or trying to find jobs in\nvarious other places. But he was there -- he -- he had gone to Bari, that\u2019s where he\nwas mostly -- no, that\u2019s where he-he was in Bar -- fi-first he was in Algiers. He had\nflown to Algiers and then they bought up these various broadcast stations and did\nleaflets and stuff [indecipherable]. And God, when you think how young they were.",
        "Q: What year did you get married?",
        "A: 1946, I believe it is.",
        "Q: 46.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And -- and what -- wha-what did he settle on? What work did he finally take up?",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t find a job. It was very, very difficult to find a job. He was told by\nseveral people to change his name. This was a very difficult time for -- there was a\nlot of social discrimination. We had one of the most awful things that he kept\nblaming himself and [indecipherable] just awful. About a year or so, I mean a year\nand a half, my mother was still in mourning and so [indecipherable] had been sick\nand friends of ours, non-Jews had told us why don\u2019t you go t -- so and so in\nTennessee, there was a very nice country hotel in the -- and by that time I was\nmarried already -- go up there.",
        "Q: In mourning for your brother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Then we got there and when we signed in they said they didn\u2019t have any room.\nAnd I -- we had to restrain Morris, he wanted to go and, you know, strangle this\npoor pe -- person at the desk.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t, and finally, you know we left.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But that was that and then you know, there were -- there were -- there were ads\nin the papers for -- that weren\u2019t o-o -- I mean, they were obvious to who wanted to\nknow, people that -- we at first didn't understand what this was about and if it -- it\nwould say, I don\u2019t know, apartment for rent, so and so, close to Protestant church or\nclose to such and such a place, or close -- you know, that kind of stuff. And some\nwere more obvious, you know, Christians only, or whatever.",
        "Q: Even in New York?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I -- you know, it wasn\u2019t very hard to find a place in\nNew York where -- where it was okay to live.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- but this 1s something I had never, never, never in my life experienced,\never, ever --",

        "A: Never. This was completely integrated, school, social life, whatever you want.\nThere was always -- the odd thing, the only person that I had ever heard of anything\nhappening like that was a cousin of ma -- not a cousin, a second cousin of mine, we\n-- you know, I guess one heard there were things going on, possibly because this\nwas such an old family, totally integrated, both on my mother\u2019s and my father\u2019s side\nand -- and maybe I don\u2019t like the -- the -- the word, you know, it\u2019s none -- the word\nis not important, but the powerful. I hate to say it but these were people who could\nprobably -- no-nobody would have dared to do it directly to me.",
        "Q: Right, right.",

That -- also I had been to -- and -- and my parents also, so it\u2019s\nnot my generation.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So this was very, very unusual --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to us.",

        "A: Never.",
        "Q: No, never? Really?",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: I think 1t was important -- I\u2019m sure it was important to Morris\u2019s family that he\nmarried a Jewish person, but they didn't quite know. They -- they -- they didn\u2019t\nunderstand really, who we were. I mean, we lived in very integrated society. And I -\n- there was recently at the museum a very nice guy from Israel who had -- he must\nhave had a very, very high position in Israel now because everybody was running\naround him like he was really somebody important. And he -- we found out that he\nhad been in Zagreb the -- this is another thing that has very little to do with me, but\nin a way maybe it\u2019s interesting. He came from a place called Gradisca originally,\nwhich is in the Burgenland, which is on the border of Slovenia and Austria. And it\nis populated mostly by people who were -- who came, I don\u2019t know in which\ncentury, probably in the 17\" or 18\" century from a very poor part of Croatia to this\narea. It\u2019s on the border, sort of Austria, Slovenia, Hungary.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay. And they\u2019re always -- they kept their national costume and they kept their\nsongs and they used to go around all over the -- all over cro -- Yugoslavia and in\nother places to sing. These were well known minorities who, after I don\u2019t know how\nmany centuries still kept their language and everything else. So this gentleman from\nIsrael tells me that he originally came from there. His father had a factory in this\nBurgenland and he told me the name of the town, I think is Firestaat, I\u2019m not quite\nsure what it was. And he was a refugee with his family in Zagreb and they were\nvery Orthodox and he told me about -- they had a separate synagogue, they had the\nseparate -- it wasn\u2019t a synagogue, it was a separate place where they went to pray or\nthey had that -- I had no idea these people existed. I had absolutely no idea. In the\nJewish school where I went, my grade school was the Jewish school in Zagreb,\nthere were a few Sephardim, very few. And there were -- I suspect from the same\nfamily --",
        "Q: From Bosnia?",
        "A: The Sephardim were from Bosnia --",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: -- originally, I\u2019m sure. I can\u2019t imagine any other place. But some Orthodox Jews,\nbecause I know that the boys were -- wore pants and I think they wore a hat, or a --\nor a -- or a [indecipherable] or whatever. They were very, very poor. These were\nfrom around Zagreb somewhere and they were dressed -- I will not say that they --\nthey weren't -- you know, they were wearing jackets, what kids would wear,\nlederhosen, God forbid. They would wear some jackets and so on and now when I\nlook at these pictures I see how they\u2019re really quite distinct. And apparently these\npeople had a -- had a -- not a synagogue, certainly a place where they gathered and\nso on. So this gentleman now from -- from -- who came from Israel was telling me\nabout that. By the way, the museum was fantastically helpful to him. They found\nsome books that -- about stuff that his father had told him originally, and he never\ncould check it out and he saw it, tears were going down his face, I mean, it was just\nunbelievable. But this gentleman told me that he had class and that they were very\nreligious, although not wearing any kind of garb, and that he -- he had the different\nrabbi. I mean, he didn't know about our rabbis, and so -- he was a child there and so\non. Now what I found out later about these peoples -- about this -- this place,\nGradisca, which now is Austria, 1s that they had parallel city governments, they had\na parallel Jewish and non-Jewish police, a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish fire\nbrigade and various other things like that. So during various holidays they would\nspell each other.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So an -- I had no idea about that --",
        "Q: I\u2019ve not heard of such a thing.",
        "A: -- he told me that.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Huh. Now, this is --",
        "A: I also didn\u2019t even know that there were that many Jews there. I remember --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, I can think of Croats and singing and folk costumes, but apparently\nthere was a very, very large Jewish community 1n that place.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: Strange.",
        "Q: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting that you were in New York at that time, where so many\nJews had come from eastern Europe.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you know, starting life all over. And -- and you didn't know that many Jews,\nand you didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: On the other hand, there was a very nice auth -- actually, I -- I did know, I mean,\nthis guy, this Polish person who -- who was a -- who -- who was a partner of my\nfather, they had come -- but I think they had come earlier.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they were not -- they were not Orthodox or anything like that. In fact, the\ndaughter married somebody, a very, very Conservative person, whose name I can\u2019t\nremember now, who I think is either at Harvard or Princeton who -- who you hear\nevery once in awhile, I -- I\u2019Il think of the name. But no, they -- yeah, then in New\nYork there was a wonderful pastry shop called Elite. Th -- I think it -- yeah, Elite.\nThe -- Elite was on 72\u2122 Street between, I think Broadway and whatever the next\nstreet was, and that\u2019s where everybody got together from various parts of -- these\nwere central Europeans, they were not eastern Europeans.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They were Germans, Austrians, Yugoslavs, maybe Czechs. And that Austro-\nHungarian pastry was what was --",
        "Q: Attracted them.",
        "A: -- trac -- was there, and I guess maybe the owners were there and large coffees\nwith heaps of whipped cream and so on. They have disappeared. And they all read,\nincluding my father and so on, was a -- an -- a newspaper called The Aufbau. Have\nyou heard about that? It\u2019s a very interesting -- 1t was a paper people were looking --\nfirst of all it was political, it was very interesting politically. And secondly you\nwould find ads. People looking and looking for so and so from such and such a\nplace, anybody know whether this person survived or not. This went on for years --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- years. And lots of very liberal editorials and so on. I don\u2019t know whether it\nstill exists, but it was called The Aufbau. And as I said, they all sat around waiting\nfor better times, yeah. I\u2019m not quite sure when we started hearing about -- about --\nreally. We knew about concentration camps, but we didn\u2019t know about killing\ncamps until fairly late.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Later than we should.",
        "Q: 45 -- \u00b044 --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- \u00b044.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And there weren\u2019t any, as a matter of fact. I mean, maybe there\nwere, but they were -- they were -- 1t was --",
        "Q: Yeah. You got married in \u00b046?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: No, I don\u2019t, mm-mm.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The other one has two.",
        "Q: Yeah. So what was your early -- the early years of your marriage? What did your\nhusband end up doing and where did you live?",
        "A: We first lived with my parents for a very short time. Then we moved one house\nfur -- one apartment building further on, 1n a studio on Riverside Drive. We were\nthere, I\u2019m not quite sure h-how long. My husband was trying to find a job, didn\u2019t\nfind a job, he -- my father was, I think, hoping that he would be maybe a\nbusinessman, which was the -- the -- the mo -- two times that he -- he tried, it was\ndisastrous, and he was very unhappy, and so that never -- one of them,\nunbelievably, was with a guy who -- who made Desenex, if you know what that 1s.",
        "Q: Oh [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, you can imagine what fun that was. But at that time it was just beginning,\nthey\u2019re probably making millions now.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Okay. That wasn\u2019t quite his thing. Then my uncle got involved -- do you\nremember L\u2019il Abner?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Do you remember the shmoos? Shmoos were little fat things that would -- that\nwould swoon and fall on the st -- on -- on -- just to please you and you could eat\nthem, and that made them very happy, or whatever. So my uncle started -- I don\u2019t\nknow how he got -- I think he got connected with Al Capp somehow, and AI C --\nmy uncle who was a lawyer, who by that time had come from Cuba -- via Cuba,\nlet\u2019s put it. He started the shmoo business and they had little boxes with shmoos on\nit and a tiny little, you know, s -- s -- candy in the little boxes, and I don\u2019t know,\nyou know, these little rings, or little -- little charms, or whatever, were stuck in\nthere. And this went for awhile, and they didn\u2019t do very well, can you well -- you\ncan well imagine it. Then this fell apart and one of the people who had meanwhile\ncome from Yugoslavia, via I\u2019m not sure how, not easily, had come -- who -- who\nwas an extremely well-off person. If I tell you that he owned the salt monopoly in\nYugoslavia --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- and various other odds and ends like that. And he had two sons, one of them\nwas a year, maybe two -- no, two years older than me, who -- one time I think the\nfamilies may have thought we\u2019d get married, but neither he ever wanted to, or I -- I\nmean wa -- not even. And we were constantly having -- we were -- we were always\ntrying to outdo each other in one thing or another and th-this started when we were\nquite small and we were both riding, and we were supposed to -- to have a -- have a\n-- I don\u2019t know, a trial for a -- for a horse show. And, I think I was maybe 11 then\nand we had -- my mother was in Vienna at the time and I had gone with a man na --\nnot with a man, he was the governors by that time, to this place where -- where we -\n- we were supposed -- supposed to practice by jump -- not jumping, but various\nother odds and ends. And there was this very beautiful horse that was very\nunpleasant, very obstreperous and very -- not very good. And this -- he said he\nwouldn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t even thinking of riding this horse, and I was -- and I was\ngoing to do some up -- one-upsmanship, I said I would. And I did, and I had an\nabsolutely horrible fall, they thought I would have had broken everything, I had a --\nI had a problem. In -- in fact, I think I ha -- since that time I have problems with my\n-- not with memory, but with other things. It took -- nothing was broken. It was an\nunbelievable thing, but nothing did. And then this -- his father, the salt monopoly\nperson, who I think by that time had changed his religion, decided to -- to go to the\nsynagogue because it hadn\u2019t -- it was me and not his son who had gotten that fall.\nAnd -- and -- and what else did he do? Yeah, and he didn\u2019t eat on Saturday until\nnoon, or some other kind of thing like that. But we\u2019ve always been friends. So\nanyhow, this guy arrived with a lot of money and he eventually got a -- not a lot,\nwell, back some money. Not quite as well as we did, because he -- they were much,\nmuch better off than we were. In fact, their house in Zagreb now is the German\nembassy residence. No, Austrian, Austrian.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Austrian. And the guy lives in New York and is 1n not very good shape. But\nanyhow, my father s -- decided this is such a wonderful businessman, that Morris,\nwho is such a miserable businessman, but does speak English and does have\nconnections and so on, and certainly knows the south, we went to Athens, Georgia,\nand they bought --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Lucie Rosenberg. This is tape number two, side A. Okay, so you -- you went\nwith this fellow who came --",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: -- to Athens --",
        "A: -- his name was [indecipherable] and there were -- there were quotas that were\navailable for -- I think it was peanut oil, mostly peanut oil. There were great\nshortages in the States and these people had this oil at -- what you would call it?\nNot a factory, 1t was -- it was a plant. And then they would homogenize some and\nthen he would buy futures, you know, like -- like huge con -- railroad containers\nworth of stuff. And then if you were smart you made a lot of money, but they lost a\nlot of money. Drove my husband up the wall and my father was absolutely\nconvinced that this very smart businessman would do it and this very nice person\nwho could, you know, talk to other people, could do anything, fell apart. Morris felt\nawful. We lived in Atlanta for about a year and a half, I believe, at the time.",
        "Q: Hm. Hm.",
        "A: I believe then we came back to New York and I became pregnant. Were -- we\nwere -- we lived in a -- a project -- my mother said it was a project, it\u2019s supposedly\nvery sheik, you know, it was a -- was something called Fresh Meadows, somewhere\nin a -- not too far, let\u2019s say, from LaGuardia airport, I would think that\n[indecipherable] and so on. And still he couldn\u2019t find a job and so on. And then we -\n- by that time my family in Venezuela said to Morris -- oh, and then there were\nseveral, again, suggestions, want you to change your name. And he refused to do\nthat and my -- up -- people at various places made this suggestion. Well meaning,\nyou know, nobody unpleasant. He said no, he wouldn\u2019t, his father had come with\nhis -- this name and, no. And he didn't want to find himself 1n a position where he\nwould, you know, not represent himself [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He is -- he is so scrupulously honest it\u2019s unbelievable, my husband. I -- I -- I can\nsometimes tell a lie if 1t\u2019s necessary. Not a lie, but a, you know, a social lie, so -- but\nhe can\u2019t, he is straight arrow. And -- as, by the way, are both my daughters. I don\u2019t\nknow that I\u2019m devious, but under circumstances I guess I could tell a lic. You know,\nnot -- not -- not for everyday use --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but I could. So then -- my cousins by that time were in Venezuela. They had\ncome via concentration camps in Italy, and for about a year or so. I don\u2019t know how\nlong they were in Spain and my father got them visas. They were going to go on\nfurther, I think, I\u2019m not quite sure where in South America, but they stayed there\nand they did very, very well, extremely well. And at the time the place was really\nstarting to move, and they asked my husband to come and see if there\u2019s anything he\nwould like to do there. He did and we -- I came over and then he -- the AP person\nwas kicked out because he wrote something about the -- the person who was the\ndictator then. And then they asked my husband to take his place, which he did and\nthen later he turned, he -- he was running a -- he and another guy, whose husband\nwas -- whose son was just recently with Bremer, asked for him and he was in -- in\n[indecipherable].

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: With a, I think, nine months old baby, with Jane. And my aunt was there and my\ncousin who is the nearest relative I now have, she\u2019s two and a half years younger\nthan I am, who had married a guy from Belgrade. A sephard -- Sephardi -- but,\noddly enough he was told by at -- it\u2019s a very interesting thing with -- his name is\nPinkas and when we -- when he got -- you know, when -- when his sons started --\nwent to the Jewish schooling -- where, by the way, my Jane also went for awhile,\nwas a very good school. He -- the director of the school said, listen, nobody called\nPinkas is as -- originally a Sephardi, how did this happen?

        "Q: Kids.",
        "A: -- not all the ki -- all the -- all the customs and the food and everything was\nSephardic and he considered himself Sephardic. I mean, he had [indecipherable] I\nguess. But he also said that when he came from the concentration camp to Madrid --\nI think they came [indecipherable] to Madrid, that it was incredible. That it smelled\nlike in his mother\u2019s kitchen, that the food had the same names as in his mother\u2019s\nkitchen, that it all tasted like that, it was totally familiar. They did very well, and he\nis su -- they\u2019re very charitable, they\u2019ve given money left and right and he has now\npaid for the publication of an extremely interesting [indecipherable] now it\u2019s the\nsecond volume, a book -- a book called \u201cMismo Prezimali,\u201d \u201cWe Survived.\u201d And\nit\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a collection of stories of people from all over, from Croatia, from serv --\nSerbia, from everywhere, who survived various camps and so on.",

        "A: Yes. [reads Spanish] and so on.",
        "Q: Right, right, who says he is the father.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Great. How long did you stay then, in -- in Venezuela? He was working as a\njournalist.",
        "A: He was working -- I\u2019m trying to think exactly how many years we were there,\nquite a few. By that time my mother had died. You know, I don\u2019t know exactly the\ndate, I wil -- forget. We were in New York when there was some -- oh, then what I\ndidn\u2019t say was that my husband then -- there w -- there was a weekly English\nlanguage paper, a weekly, called the \u201cCaracas Daily Journal,\u201d which he turned into\na daily. And it\u2019s not the paper th-that -- page that I told you the English page, that\nwas in a place called [indecipherable] I believe. And we were in New York and\nthere was -- on vacation visiting my father, to -- getting ready to go to New York, to\n-- to Europe, I believe, when there was some kind of business manipulation and he\nfound out that it wa -- he didn\u2019t want to stay there any more. They didn\u2019t really oust\nhim, but practically. There was a reason. I\u2019m f -- I\u2019m not quite sure how -- how it\nwent, but anyhow, he never went back. He didn\u2019t ba -- go back for various other\nreasons, and so on. And meanwhile, a very good friend of ours who had previously\nworked for Standard Oil of New Jersey, I believer it was, had been working -- I\nthink he was already in the Ford Foundation and he -- he asked him to join as a\ndirector for east we -- east -- for -- it wasn\u2019t east west [indecipherable] I\u2019m not quite\nsure how. They started at the -- the Institute of International Education, and he was\njust started and they started exchanges with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and\nthey were bringing in scholars and students and so on. And then he took a group of\nU.S. governors through a very extensive trip through the Soviet Union, and there\nwas a lot of, you know, brotherhood and such going on. And then he found that this\nreally bored him terribly because of the director of -- of -- of the Institute of\nInternational Education said Morris, why don\u2019t you present -- you know, do a paper\non that or give a suggestion on that and he would do it within 48 hours, and the man\nsaid you\u2019re supposed to take two months to do that. You -- you\u2019re making life very\nhard for the rest of us. And this went on and on and on like that til finally he -- he\nwasn\u2019t very happy about that. I mean, it was extremely interesting, but -- and by\nthat time students were coming in and graduate students mostly from -- from\nYugoslavia to Russian, so I was -- I thought it was interesting, but it wasn\u2019t fast\nenough for him. So meanwhile, a friend of his at the Associated Press said,\nwouldn\u2019t you please join our [indecipherable] services? [indecipherable] time and\nhe said yes. And then we were in New York til -- again, I can\u2019t tell you everything,\nwe were there for about two years, two and a half years. They -- and then he had all\nsorts of, you know, reporting trips all over the world, you know, mostly Latin\nAmerica. And after that -- let me quickly think how that would -- okay, they asked\nhim to go to Mexico as bureau chief. And again, don\u2019t ask me for dates. Where we\nwere on and off for, I think six or eight years, something like that.",
        "Q: So, sounds like early 60\u2019s you were 1n the --",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: In Mexico.",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Mm. Your mother\u2019s -- when -- before you -- when you were going out\nwith this English fellow --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Your mother was afraid that you were going to go off to the colonies and she\nwas going to lose you.",
        "A: I think maybe England more than anything. The poor guy was, you know\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: But you -- but you ended up traveling all over the world.",
        "A: Yeah, of course.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My -- all my things that I had left -- I had been in school in England, I had left\nthere wearing that disguise, Mother\u2019s house. And I got them after the war.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he was killed, poor soul --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- in Burma, and it was -- it was pretty sad.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t have been successful in any way [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. So we\u2019re up to the early 60\u2019s, let\u2019s take a break, okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s do that. [tape break] Okay, we\u2019re back. We\u2019re going to make a little\ncorrection here to some of the dates that we\u2019ve been talking about, so go ahead,\nLucie.",
        "A: Okay. We arrived in Venezuela in 1950 because Morris couldn\u2019t find any kind\nof job in New York and I had family there that had just, a few years earlier re --\ngotten to Venezuela via camps in Italy, via Spain and then arrived there, I think\ntheir destination was somewhere else, but they stopped there and it seemed to have\nbeen a very good environment for them in every way. And Venezuela was really\nthriving at the time in spite of a very unpleasant dictatorship and -- okay. It -- it\nworked. And as I say, I -- I was some -- not some, but I was quite depressed. I di --\ndidn\u2019t speak Spanish. I helped myself with a little bit of Italian, but there we were\nand Morris then found a job with -- with Associated Press eventually, and we stayed\nin Venezuela until 1958. This was the time when I was teaching English in various\nplaces. It started out the suggestion of a friend of ours who worked for the U.S.\ngovernment, was at the embassy. At that time United States was setting up so called\nbi-national centers throughout Latin America [speaks foreign language here] this\n[indecipherable] that. And this particular one at the time was in downtown Caracas\nin an old, very beautiful colonial house, but obviously not meant for a school. There\nwas a huge patio with a lovely huge tree in which there was a sloth that would turn\nup every so often. And also a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 opened a barba -- opened a\nsteakhouse there. It was very nice, on one end of it. And the rest of it around this\npatio were classes. And I started giving classes to all Venezuelans of one kind or\nanother. Also Spaniards who came, who worked, it was very strange, you would\nhave -- for instance you would have Venezuelans who were -- who hardly had an\neducation at all who were very, very talented and learned the language very fast,\nwhereas you had Spaniards who were -- with -- with university degrees who were\nreally having problems in --",
        "Q: Hm, with English.",
        "A: -- with English.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And this was going on for awhile among -- there were various American\ncompanies that sent their -- their -- their employees that needed to learn the\nlanguage --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- over to the center. So after awhile, a large hotel opened up, a -- belonging to\nan American company, I believe it was Pan American who owned it, but there was\na hotel called Tamana -- the hotel was called Tamana Cuentos, the large new hotel\nin Venezuela. So these people were coming from the site to this center, which was\nin the center of town. And then they decided that this was not good for them and\nthey offered me a contract to simply go to the hotel and sit there and ask the\nemployees, got enough time, they would come and get a class. So then I invented\nsome kind of very unscientific way of teaching them hotel English. Because you\nhad to teach a chambermaid something else than you would have to teach a -- I\ndon\u2019t know, a bellboy or something like that, or a waiter, etcetera.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I made up a lil -- little -- little classes and little phrasebooks for each one of\nthem and they would come, and was wonderful, in the middle of a patio with lovely\nflowers around and so on and they just wait for them. And we found, you know,\nthat if they needed to work, they worked, if they could come, they could come and I\nkept -- and I had a flat salary and it was really very nice doing it. This went on for\nquite awhile, I don\u2019t really remember exactly how -- for how long. And the rest of\nthe time I had a very nice time with -- my cousins were there, there was a large\nYugoslav community of one kind or another there. Mostly refugees, mostly Jews,\nbut not exclusive -- actually, not at all exclusively, there was a very successful\nDalmatian entrepreneur who was building bridges and who was importing cement\nand so on. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re still there, they\u2019re very successful still. He\u2019s in his\n80\u2019s, but he still travels back and forth to Yugoslavia [indecipherable] to Croatia,\nlet\u2019s say, probably -- I --I -- he is from southern Dalmatia, I\u2019m almost certain. And\nthen his sister came, an absolutely gorgeous woman. And --",
        "Q: Let me -- let me interrupt you, you had this community, some of whom had a --\nso-some of them were relatives, and -- and this is now, we\u2019re talking 10 years or so,\nafter the end of World War II.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You know, a lot of people that I talk to say that they -- they didn\u2019t talk much\nabout what they\u2019d been through during the war, that these were years when people\nwere just making every effort to starting over and building a new life and that what\nwas past was past and there really wasn\u2019t much talk about it. Was that your\nexperience? I mean, you --",
        "A: To a certain extent, not -- not 100 percent.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I think they talked among each other quite a bit. This was a very heterogeneous\ngroup. I\u2019m just thinking, for instance, my -- my aunt\u2019s very closest relative was a\nwoman, a Serbian woman from Novi Sad, who lost her son, actually, who drowned\nin Lake Geneva when there were refugees there. And then her husband died very\nfast, so you know, she was absorbed into the community. Some of them had been in\nthe same camps in Italy. There -- there was only one woman that I know who had\nactually been to a very unpleasant, very -- I mean, in the actual killing camp in -- in\nGermany. No, I don\u2019t think so. I -- I think they talked. They didn\u2019t talk -- yeah, th-\nthey -- they -- they talked among each other the most of.",
        "Q: Yeah. But your experience was quite different from most of them.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: Because you\u2019d gotten out.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I didn\u2019t experience any of that, and I -- truly I -- I -- there was a guilt\nfeeling.",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think they thought [indecipherable] may -- maybe to an extent,\nyou know, because my brother was killed, and he was a U.S. soldier, but I -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Talk about that Lucie, how?",
        "A: Well, he -- he --",
        "Q: No, I mean, talk about your feeling, about guilt.",
        "A: You know that you have so many of your friends, huge numbers on all sides, I\nmean, Jews, Catholics, communists, Croatian Nationalists of one kind or another,\neven UstaSas, that you know th-th-they were -- they -- they there were very\nambivalent feelings there. But I don\u2019t think I was ever embittered. I don\u2019t think\neven my -- my parents were. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people who were, I don\u2019t want to\nhear about these people any more, don\u2019t talk to me about it, I don\u2019t care. But I -- I --\nI -- I never had that feeling. I was always very much connected to it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Possibly because I wasn\u2019t there, possibly because there was -- you know,\nwhatever I remembered was very nice.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were you in, during those years after the war, a-after you came to the\nU.S., were you in touch with people who stayed?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. People who sort of started trickling back.",
        "Q: What do you mean, going back? Going back in --",
        "A: No, people -- well, some -- some went back, and jus -- 1n a very -- well, this was\n-- some very sad things happened. For instance, my -- not my -- my -- my cousin,\nMia Bauer Pinkas, she had the large family on her father\u2019s side, th-the Bauers. And\namong them was Hanitsa Bauer, who -- whose father was a -- not a member of the\ncommunist party, but very left leaning and -- and actually had all kinds of trouble\nwith -- he -- he had to be very careful about it. One member of that family, a\nnephew, this was a guy who was a communist who was actually in jail at the age of,\nI don\u2019t know, maybe 18 - 19, pre-war Yugoslavia and who was killed in -- 1t was a\nnational hero and was killed in -- in the jail. His name was [indecipherable]\nFriedman. So, okay, this was a left leaning family. Dr. Bauer and Anitsa, after being\nan -- in ital -- in an Italian camp went to London and spent the blitz in England.\nThey were the first ones to go back. Not with the government in exile, but with -- I\ndon\u2019t know, [indecipherable] was liberated and there was a government. I don\u2019t\nknow whether it was really a government, but yeah, it was, formed, he went back.\nHe was a -- he was a x-ray specialist, a radiologist. And he, I think he was\n[indecipherable] in uniform as a colonel to the Yugoslav army, Tito\u2019s army and so\non and he was on the on the [indecipherable] for awhile. And his daughter Anitsa\nalso went, I don\u2019t know what happened to the wife, I think -- I guess she must have\ngone, too. And after awhile they went to Zagreb. This was not a good thing. They\nwere, after awhile very disappointed that -- what was going on. I believe one of the\nsayings were -- were -- were you -- you were conveniently in London during the\nwar while we were in the mountains. And I think there may have even been some\nintimations of anti-Semitism, but I will not swear, I will not say that. They ended up\nby going to Israel.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And then from Israel to Venezuela.",

But the list consisted of two pair of pajamas, gym\nclothes, shoes --that means special slippers for gym. For a little girl such and such,\nso many pair of socks, for little boys that many underwear. This was absolutely --\nyou know, and that they were changing them, they were not the same. And the\nterrible story about this is that one of the woman, who by the way is part of that\nBauer family. A woman -- a woman who was an entrepreneur by herself in Istanbul\nin the lumber business. I think she was a widow and she was -- she was in the\nlumber business in Istanbul. And one of the people who was supposed to come was\nher grandson, whose name was Fayja, I forget the surname. He\u2019s a boy of maybe\neight, 10, not sure how -- and -- and I saw him on the list, by the way. And -- and\nthe list kept changing, too, you know. I don\u2019t know whether these children have\nbeen -- since then some were -- been taken away, some -- th-there -- there was all\nkinds of [indecipherable] going on there. And finally this group arrived in Istanbul,\nand -- which was known by the way, Croatia society [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Yeah. And it was met, among other people, by this lady. And this lady was\nrunning around and calling this Fayjus\u2019 name. And the local boy presented himself,\nbut it was not Fayja. And you can imagine what kind of a scene that --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Lucie Rosenberg. This is tape number two, side B. But you were saying that\nwhen this group of children arrived in Istanbul --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- this woman met the group and this -- a boy answered to her grandson\u2019s name -",
        "A: A boy son -- a boy ans --",
        "Q: -- but it wasn\u2019t him.",
        "A: -- but it wasn\u2019t him. But what had happened, this boy died in Zagreb of an\ninfectious disease while these lists were, you know, still [indecipherable]. And the -\n- inserted into the group of I don\u2019t know, there had to be that many that were\npermitted to go, was a child from Hungary, who was told to say he was Fayja so\nand so.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And you can imagine that grandmother who thought this child had been saved.\nAnd i -- it --",
        "Q: Jeez, she must have been frantic.",
        "A: She was totally frantic. By the way, there\u2019s a relative of this person in New York\nwho\u2019s a -- who came on a totally different -- who came with some kind of child\ntransport from France, and boy -- and -- and to some foster parents in New Jersey.\nAnd he 1s a very well-known scientist at NYU, and he\u2019s working on that famous\naccelerator in -- in -- in Geneva, or in -- on the -- on the border with France.",

        "Q: You know what -- roughly what year this would have been?",
        "A: I think this must have been \u201941 - \u201942.",
        "Q: Yeah. And were there many groups of children that went out of Croatia like that?",
        "A: I only know of this one, there may have been others. I\u2019m -- there were various\nways of kids being pulled out, but this was an official group and this was going\nthrough -- through the -- I guess the Germans and the -- the Croatian authorities and\ntheir -- I\u2019m telling you, there was more paperwork on -- on -- on what they were\nallowed to bring with them, including gym clothes. This was very important. And --",
        "Q: And did they make it to Israel?",
        "A: They made it to Israel.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah. From Istanbul. Amazingly, one person who actually I -- I don\u2019t -- he -- he\nis not rela -- related to them. There\u2019s a man here who was working at the Institute of\nPeace, who 1s married to this -- let\u2019s see, she\u2019s not a relative of mine, but she 1s --\nsh-sh-she is a -- a close relative of a -- of -- of my cousins, I mean, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s a --\nmy cousin -- they have the same grandmother, let\u2019s put it that way, or great-\ngrandmother, some -- anyhow, she -- she\u2019s a blood relative. She\u2019s not my blood\nrelative, she\u2019s a relative who went to -- who spent the war -- I know I -- probably in\nItaly. Her -- her mother was the sister of this guy, Browning that I told you who was\nthe -- the famous leftist and -- and -- and a national hero and -- in -- in -- in Croatia.\nThis m-ma -- this person whose name is Tuval, who was this professor and -- lately,\nbut he was at Harvard and he\u2019s also at -- at the university in Jerusalem and who\nworked here at the Institute of Peace, and this 1s -- is -- is a very wonderful scholar.\nHis father -- they -- they had emi -- immigrated very much earlier from Novi Sad.\nThey were well known Zionists and his father went to Israel. I think they lived --\nthey lived in Jerusalem. And he went through grade school and unive -- and then --\nand high school and university in -- in Israel or m -- and then came to the States and\nstudied and then went back. There\u2019s a big tragedy in that family, too, but I won\u2019t\ntell you about. He was working with a Jewish a -- Jewish agency, I believe, the\nfather. This person was w-working with a Jewish agency in Istanbul. And the Papal\nNuncio in Jerusalem was the wonderful pope, you know, the -- John the whatever,\nthe -- the -- the super pope. He was nice, wonderful pope was --",
        "Q: What -- hang on a second. [tape break]",
        "A: Yeah, well by then already -- but he was Pope John.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Who helped out with -- wi-wi -- with all kinds of -- of immigration things and\nhelped out with the Germans and so on, was absolutely wonderful in every way.",

        "Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do -- was there any -- did your father ever consider going to\nIsrael instead of the United States?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think so. He was very touched when he first came to Israel, when he\nvisited, he -- he actually felt at home. I -- I -- I did not.",

        "A: I did not.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: It was a very excellent school and ya -- she -- actually she learned to write\nHebrew and -- and -- and Spanish at the same time, because this was bilingual and\nthis -- 1t was span -- it was called -- what was it called? Escuela [indecipherable] my\nGod, how is this, how am I forgetting that? [speaks foreign language here] 1t was\ncalled. And one of her first teachers [indecipherable] was a -- brought from Israel\nand she was of Bosnian descent.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. A very nice woman. The other one was, I guess, either Russian Jewish or\nPolish Jewish or whatever. It was a very, very good school, and it had the regular\ncurriculum of the Venezuelan government, you know, whatever the Ministry of\nEducation had, plus a Jewish curriculum. So, you know, there wa -- there was never\nany -- any doubt in any of that. All --",
        "Q: What do you -- what do you mean, any doubt about what?",

Also, when we got back to New York, about\nwhich we will speak later, my father insisted that Jane go to a Sunday school in\nNew York, a Jewish Sunday school. And num -- and -- and when we were in -- in\nMexico, I had -- Mary went off to a Jewish Sunday school. Not for long, but she did\ngo. And Jane did, and so on.

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean if -- it was like you had dark hair or light hair or whatever, it was part of\nyour -- your being and that was it. And that had a feeling, you know, that it didn\u2019t\nreally require any -- any -- any nurturing. I -- maybe that was a mistake, I mean,\nthey -- they\u2019re well aware of everything and then, in fact, Jane married a non-Jewish\nperson who then, at his own behest became a -- a -- converted to Judaism and 1n his\nsecond marria -- marriage, married another Jewish woman. I thought that was quite\ninteresting.",

        "Q: When your daughters -- your daughters both knew your father and mother.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: No, we -- this -- this was very straightforward.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they were among people 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- who -- who talked about it one way or\nanother. I mean th-this was very fresh in my cousin\u2019s memory, for instance 1n -- in -\n- in Caracas. She was surrounded by people who had been in this camp and that\ncamp and it was -- it was daily conversations.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And some of it was even fun.",
        "Q: How so\u201d?",
        "A: For instance, my cousin met her husband in -- in -- 1n -- actually, near\nDubrovnik, but they were -- they were all -- both sent to a camp in Albania and the\nromance developed then -- then, and then they were sent to a camp in -- in Italy and\nit continued. And when they finally -- this -- this is another thing that very few\npeople talk about and has -- has nothing to do with my families, but I do want to\ncome back to that. You know, they -- they -- they had their own social life and they\ntried to cook and so on together. There was memories that they talked about.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. The camps that your cousin were in were more like detention camps\nthan [indecipherable] what we think of --",
        "A: They were concentration camps, but they were not -- they were not killing camps\nof any kind.",
        "Q: Right. They were forced labor camps?",

One of them I for -- one of them was in -- in -- under Italian -- this was\nobviously by -- at that time Albania was under Italian occupation, had been for\nsome time and they were brought from the Dalmatian coast to -- to Albania and I\ndon\u2019t know exactly how long they were there, but they -- they were then taken to --\nby the Italian army, or Italian authorities to another camp which was called ferra --\nFerramonti di Tarsia in -- I forget where -- where exactly in Italy it was. [tape\nbreak] Think we was talking about the groups and -- no, I don\u2019t remember. [tape\nbreak] -- went over that they -- they -- they came to Spain and from -- and Spain,\nthey sent this telegram to us and then my father was going around to find out who\nwould give them visas and affidavits and -- and obviously deposits at the consulates\nfor money and then that\u2019s how it -- how they got there, they\u2019re all doing very well\nnow.",
        "Q: Hm.",

        "Q: Mm-hm. But that\u2019s the only one?",
        "A: There -- there were some who were maybe more -- yeah. But on the other hand,\nmy cousin didn\u2019t go to Jewish school in Zagreb and I did. I did go to the Jewish\nschool where obviously you had the regular Yugoslav curriculum for -- for grade\nschool, it went from one to four. And -- plus Hebrew.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And actu -- and Biblical history. And at that time already, there w -- and I\u2019m\ntalking in the early 30\u2019s -- late 20\u2019s, early 30\u2019s, there were, in Croatian, Zionist\nchildren\u2019s magazines with beautiful woodblocks in it. And I still remember the\nname of one of them -- an -- of the main one, it was ca-called [indecipherable]. And\nI think it -- they were monthlies. Had stories about children, about Israel. About\nPalestine, not about Israel, about Palestine. And there -- there were people who\nwere leaving. There was, in my class in grade school, the son of the big Zionist\nleader, whose name was Dr. Alexander Leite, who -- whose son was in my class\nand sadly the -- he died at the -- I think the age of nine, maybe even 10, from scarlet\nfever. And that was a horrible loss. And Dr. Leite then went and -- and -- and was\nvery, very active in -- in Israel. I think he -- I th -- I think he survived. Yeah, I think\nhe did. He went over there. And there was a younger daughter by the name of\nTamara who may still be alive in -- in Israel.",
        "Q: Let me ask you about the 50\u2019s.",
        "A: Mm-hm?",
        "Q: It was -- so Tito had taken power and there was so much repression there --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- in the 50\u2019s and people were jailed and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- still terrible things going on there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have -- were you in touch with people who were there, who had\nsurvived in Zagreb and -- Jews or relatives who had survived and stayed on, and did\nyou have any correspondence or connection with them during those first 10 years or\nso after the war?",
        "A: Yes, we did, but those that survived were mostly leftists and those were people\nwho would have been -- who would have been partisans.",
        "Q: And come to power.",
        "A: And come to power.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: And then somewhere, of course, I mean, as I said, Dr. Richard Bauer decided\nthis was not for him and he went --he went to Israel. I know a lot of people who\nfinally did. The person that I mentioned to you before, aga -- who -- who lives here\nnow, she was a little girl, her uncle -- and she -- she -- most of her -- the war she\nspent with her grandmother, she tried to go -- they tried to get visas to go to Israel\nand they could not get a visa and they could not get a visa. And finally they\nappealed the -- the -- the grandmother appealed to one of the politburo members\nwho had been in the same -- I don\u2019t know whether cell, but certainly in the same jail\nas her husband -- I mean as her -- as her son, Branimir. And there was no letter, but\nthey suddenly got a permission to leave for Israel.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s go back to you and Morris are, in the late 50\u2019s, you are in --",
        "A: We are in --",
        "Q: -- Venezuela.",
        "A: -- Venezuela. We\u2019re still in Venezuela.",
        "Q: You go back to New York in 1958.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: For a couple more years?",
        "A: Yeah. This -- this was sort of unexpected, we were supposed to be on vacation\nand then something happened with Morris\u2019s job, which I don\u2019t want to go into right\nnow, it just got to be complicated, and -- and -- and Jane developed the measles, I\nbelieve, or something and we could -- we were supposed to have gone to Europe\nand we did not. And so he started working for first -- the Institute for International\nEducation for east west exchange. But he found that 1t was going mu -- 1t was very\nslow. I mean, he was given a project that was a -- that he finished within, I don\u2019t\nknow, three, four days and this was supposed to take several weeks. And he just\ncouldn\u2019t stand it and then he quit. And meanwhile, at the same time, the Associated\nPress asked him to please come back and he did. There was -- he was on a night\nshift or on -- on -- on -- on an awful shift and at we -- that was pretty stressful I\nmust say. He hardly ever saw the children and so on. And -- but he had some very\ninteresting [indecipherable] etcetera. And we were there from \u201958 to \u201961. The\namusing thing was I, having gone to -- going to a private high school in Yugoslavia\npre-war, there must have been something wrong with you. This was, you know, you\n-- th-that was -- it was looked down upon in a very serious manner. And I remember\nmy poor brother who had been in England and had lost a year\u2019s worth of national\nhistory in the croa -- and the national language. He, in order not to lose a year in\nhigh school, went to a private school and it -- that was the most dramat -- I mean the\nmost horrible thing for him, he absolutely hated it, yeah.",
        "Q: I think that -- yeah, you told this story before.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, you know, you went to a public school.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And as we came -- as I said, as we Ca -- as -- as -- when we came to New York I\ninsisted that Jane go to a public school. And we bought this -- and what was\nsupposed to be a very good public school was P.S. six and P.S. six was in an\nextremely expensive neighborhood and the only wa-way she could have gone, we\nhad to buy acon -- no, not condo, what you call, the -- these other things.",
        "Q: Co-op?",
        "A: Co-op. And finally as we, you know, after a year we saw that she was way\nahead, and so she was taken out and she went to the United Nations school.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Which was very good at that time. The amazing thing was, you know, she would\ngo there, changing buses twice with a friend. And there was, you know, she was\nabout 10. It was very nice, that wa -- that was good. The same time I ran into\nsomebody who had been a very intimate friend of mine for years of -- when we\nwere both at Voice of America, and her name was Mira Mihalofska and her\nhusband was the Polish U.N. ambassador there. We ran into -- into each other at the\ncocktail party. I had no idea that\u2019s where she was. And we\u2019d been in touch ever\nsince. So one of the boys was in Jane\u2019s class at the U.N. school, the ol-older one\nwas also at the U.N., but -- so that was good.",
        "Q: So you had three nice years there.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And also my father was there and there were -- and -- and an aunt of my\nmother\u2019s who was still alive, who had survived in the most horrifying manner. She\nwas in Italy with her husband, who was a -- she was born in Hungary and she was --\nshe grew up in Osiek, her mar -- her -- her mother married a second time, a\nwidower. And they were in something that was known as the con -- a confino\nlibero. Confino libero consisted of you were 1n a small town in Italy and you\nreported to the police, I guess once a w -- day that you were there. And they were\nstaying in a room or two rooms or whatever, in -- in Some pensionne or wherever\nthey were billeted. And that was it. And her husband apparently was -- had gotten\nsome gold pieces that he must have been counting, or somebody was aware of the\nfact that he had them, and they -- some -- th-this had nothing to do with the\nHolocaust or anything, these were plain old robbers, had killed him and hit her on\nthe head and buried them both. And she woke up when she came to and she was\nburied on top of her husband, and she crawled out.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And saw the dead husband there. And there was a big -- do I have, and I\npromised the museum that I would get all of these newspaper clippings 1n Italian\nand give it to them. Things like beautiful Jewess, you know, resurrected from the\ngrave, so to speak. She wasn\u2019t beautiful at all, bu-but she was a younger person, so\nanyhow Italians were being very complimentary. And she stayed there and finally\nwas permitted to go to Switzerland where she worked as a maid. The Swiss were,\nyou know, the Swiss were the way they were. And they permitted her to stay there.\nAgain, she had to go, I think once a week or so or maybe even more often with a --\nwith a little I.D. with her picture on it to present herself to the police that she was\nthere and she worked as a maid, or cleaning woman, I\u2019m not quite sure what.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And finally we were able to get her visa and she came to New York and she\nstayed with us for awhile.",
        "Q: Your father brought her.",
        "A: My mother. This was on my mother\u2019s side. Her name was Clara Frankel.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You mentioned here in the late 50\u2019s that your father was still alive. Had\nyour mother passed away?",
        "A: My mother passed away yes, in her fi -- and we were still in Venezuela,\nsomewhere like \u201957 or so.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yup, but my father was fir -- he came to us and then he went wi -- he went on a\ntrip around the world. And of course he\u2019d been going back and forth to Yugoslavia\na great deal.",
        "Q: Oh, he had?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In the 50\u2019s?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was he -- was he doing business?",
        "A: No, he was seeing friends. He was working on -- on this restitution that we were\nsupposed to get and getting papers together and so on. I still keep finding bits and\npieces of paper that he was working on. And seeing friends. He would go on\nvacation in the north, on -- do you know where Opatiya 1s?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay, to Opatija for weeks at a time. And seeing friends.",
        "Q: When did you finally go back for the first time?",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think -- have -- I went -- I truly -- I do -- I\u2019m trying to remember\nwhether I went with Morris and my uncle or whether I went with my father. I think\nI went with my father. Somewhere in the 50\u2019s.",
        "Q: In the 50\u2019s?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: You had been gone ma -- no, 10 years?",
        "A: Yeah. Even less maybe, I\u2019m -- you know, probably 10 years.",

But that -- 1t was -- it was just the way I had\nbeen sent photographs.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I saw various friends, some who had gotten married. Male friends, boy friends,\nwhatever, people like that who I\u2019d been in correspondence with all the time, and --\nand a few girlfriends. Then -- and -- and my father st -- oddly enough, quite a few\npeople that he knew were still alive, he was seeing them and so on. And by that t-\ntime -- by that time I think quite a few of the -- whoever was Jewish had left, unless\nthat had been really very rabid leftists. My father\u2019s very intimate friend for years\npre-war was the Yugoslav or Croatian, whatever you want to call it, sculptor, Antun\nAugustin\u00e9ic. And they had been in contact pretty much the -- forever, and he was a\nvery close friend of Tito\u2019s and he was very high up in the government.

When that was being put up my -- I\ndon\u2019t know whether Augustin\u00a2i\u00a2 stayed with -- I was not, I was in probably -- Iam\n-- 1am not sure where I was, probably in Caracas at the time.

        "Q: -- that your father was going back to Yugoslavia in the 50\u2019s, and that you went\nback for a visit. It\u2019s so interesting to hear this, because you rarely hear it from\nHolocaust survivors --",

        "A: And one of the strangest -- I don\u2019t know whether I told this story at all, maybe I\ndid, if it\u2019s -- came back and I started visiting people around the place and among oth\n-- and then, you know, Zagreb is a very small town and was a much smaller town\nand suddenly the word was aha, she\u2019s here. And people started inviting me back and\nforth. So one of the peop -- two people remain in my memory, that was first time I\nwent back. One was -- were the parents of a childhood friend of mine by the name\nof Zlatan Blinavich. Zlatan Blinavich I knew when he was 10 years -- when I was\n10 years old and he was 11 years old and we were sort of -- not childhood\nsweethearts, but anyhow, an interest. And we were -- the family was very Croatian\nnationalist, although I would have never thought of them as UstaSa by any means.\nThe mother, I believe, was Austrian, but I\u2019m not sure. Maybe German. Austrian, I\nbelieve. And he and I -- I mean, he went all to -- to, say the equivalent of my\nschool, the [indecipherable] gymnasia, which was in another part of town. But we\nplayed tennis together and we -- we were very close friends. That sort of -- held\nhands maybe, stuff like that. And he apparently collaborated like crazy. If not more\nthan collaborated and immediately after the war, took off for Argentina. And I had\nheard that. You heard all sorts of things because there was -- in particul -- I -- you\nknow, it was a very key generation. People who were between say 18 and 22 - 25\nwhen the war started. [coughs] Excuse me. So this lady heard that [indecipherable]\nand her husband that I was back and she asked me to come and visit her. It was a\nbig story about you know, he hasn\u2019t been -- he really never collaborated, he was\ncalled into the army and he was part of the -- he was -- he was not an UstaSa, he was\njust a foot soldier and so on. But that\u2019s not true because if he had been he would\nhave stayed and he went to Argentina and never came back. And I really don\u2019t\nknow why -- why they called me, but maybe -- you know, they knew me from\nchildhood on and I felt they probably wanted to -- they weren\u2019t -- were they\napologizing? Maybe. Maybe.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- maybe pleased to see that somebody had survived. And I never heard from\nhim, but I heard via others that he was in Argentina and died fairly young, as far as I\nknow. The other person I visited was the mother of a friend of mine who became a\ngreat -- he wasn\u2019t a friend of mine, he -- he was a friend of my brother\u2019s, he went to\nschool with my brother. Her -- his father was a -- one of the few psychiatrists in the\ncountry and he ran a psychiatric hospital near Zagreb and then after the war he was\naccused of some malfeasance by the communists and he committed suicide. That\nwas a horrible story. He was completely innocent, but they kept pushing and\npushing and finally -- and his son was a very, very prominent newspaperman in\nBelgrade later on. He\u2019s a friend of ours. And this lady heard that I was in Zagreb\nand insisted that I come and see her, which I did. And this -- this is a si -- this 1s one\nof those things that I never will get over with, how are you -- how are you, and you\nknow, about the son, who at that time was in Belgrade, married for the second time.\nAnd by the way, we were friends in Mexico, he -- he ba -- he ba [indecipherable]\nthe corresponding [indecipherable] in Mexico. The lady -- I-I walk in and she\u2019s oh,\nhow nice to see you, keeps looking at my clothes, and this, that and the other, and\nsays, you know, I remember exactly what you wore to the opera and tel -- to\nPacival. And describes this dress to me, I had completely forgotten. I mean, here her\nson had gone through partisanship, her husband was -- committed suicide because\nof -- because of pressures. Her life is nothing. By the way, one son is a very\nprominent physician somewhere in -- in -- I don\u2019t know, in the -- in the s -- you\nknow, the United States, in -- in the middle west, I believe. And she\u2019s describing\nmy -- the dress I wore, for Pete\u2019s sakes. You know, wha-what remain -- what goes\non in people\u2019s minds? I couldn\u2019t te -- I don\u2019t know, maybe this is some kind of a\ndefense mechanism because th -- fa -- you know, I remembered eventually, I mean,\nthis was -- as it was I hated all of this getting dressed and dressed up and so on, and\nI hated it. But apparently this was what you did, so --",
        "Q: Hm. Hm.",
        "A: And why was I forced to si-sit through Pacival at age maybe 17 or 18, whatever,\nI can\u2019t imagine either.",

But I saw something that was extremely interesting at\nthe time. They put up a bullfight for Tito. Tito was a very good shot and a very\ngood hunter and so on. And in fact there was a lot of stuff go -- you know, that --\nthere\u2019s -- there was a -- a state owned -- large estate where there were -- there --\nthere were -- I don\u2019t even know what -- or how I would go th -- I -- I think there\nwere -- an agricultural estate called Bainya, and they had [indecipherable] went\nthere for a hunting, and he did too, and he killed a bunch of things, and there were\nremarks about how this was brought there for him to be able to cab -- it\u2019s not true,\nhe was a good shot, and a good hunter, anyhow. But he went to this -- I saw this --\nto this bullfight in Mexico, and there was a very unusual incident where the bull\njumped and got caught, you know, where this -- this blind where the -- where --\nwhere -- where the bullfighter hides?",

        "Q: And he can hide behind it.",
        "A: Yes. Well, this bull got caught between the wall and was sort of straddling this\nand -- and he -- Tito walked away, he couldn\u2019t look at that.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: I mean, I wasn\u2019t that close to him to have -- to have known the remarks, but I\nwas told later on by the ambassador, who was a very nice Macedonian, at the time\nmarried to a Viennese woman, and also this person that I just mentioned before,\nwho became a well-known American jour -- I mean, Yugoslav journalist, that -- that\nhe got so shocked by the brutality of it, he collected himself and left.",
        "Q: Hm, that\u2019s interesting.",

        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah. And he was there for a bullfight, after all.",
        "A: He was there for a bullfight.",
        "Q: Yeah. Huh.",
        "A: That was a a very strange thing, I mean --",
        "Q: So you met him at that time?",
        "A: I met him at that --",
        "Q: You said hello?",
        "A: -- at that -- some kind of a reception --",

        "A: -- that the ma -- the Mexican government gave and -- and Jovanka was there and\nthis was a very sad thing because Ambassador Vlahov\u2019s wife, who was this\nViennese lady -- it\u2019s a funny combination of th-the Macedonian and the -- and the\nViennese. She had a hard time ad -- adjusting to Mexico, I remember very well.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She developed that week, a terrible urinary tract infection, and she had to go by\ncar with Jovanka. The men went fr -- went -- I don\u2019t know whether they went by\nplane or whether they went by a special [indecipherable] group, but she was\nattached up to Mrs. Tito. And they stopped halfway, I think maybe even overnight,\nI\u2019m not sure, in a town between Mexico and Acapulco. And, poor woman, not only\ndid this happen to her, but then they were presented by the governor of this state\nwith a beautiful carved box. And in the box was a very fine rebosa. But it was such\na fine silk rebosa that it was -- it was folded into this box, which I saw, which was\nno bigger than this.",
        "Q: Say what that is.",
        "A: A rebosa is one of those shawls that Mexican women wear.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But there are -- of course there are plain ones that are used every day and this\nwas a super gala one, but it was Mexican, it was not liba -- I\u2019m not quite sure. This\nwas a -- a Specific place where this came from, a very famous, very beautiful,\nterribly thin. Almost like -- like -- like an Indian shawl, it was. I mean Indian from\nIndia.",

        "A: -- entertain that s -- head of s -- I mean, this -- this was really awful. So then they\nwent -- finally then went to -- then there was a huge state reception, with lots of\nmusic and lots of singing and he -- Tito didn\u2019t like -- there was a -- there\u2019s a very\nfamous Mexican female singer of folk songs and there\u2019s a song called Cu cu ru cu\ncu Paloma.",
        "Q: I know that song.",
        "A: Okay. There\u2019s a great deal of Cu cu ru cu cu Paloma going on and Tito liked that\nvery well, and there were a lot of speeches and so on, so okay, we were all part of\nthis business, not because, you know, Lucie Rosenberg of Yugoslavia, but because\nof Morris Rosenberg, the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: So -- or maybe not. Maybe a little bit of both, because we were -- we were fairly\nclose with the Mahoffs, and they lived very near us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Lucie, would you have considered yourself a Tito supporter at that\ntime?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm, yeah. I mean, at the beginning -- at -- at -- at-at that time it was\nstarting to look a little less terrific, but I -- we all knew what was going on, more or\nless.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But maybe by that time no longer. But I -- we\u2019re -- who were you looking for?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There was nobody on the horizon. You could get some very unpleasant Serb\nnationalists or very unpleasant Croatian nationalists. And were very few moderates\nthat you could even think about.",

        "A: Early 60\u2019s. I think we got there in \u201961.",
        "Q: Right. And -- and where would -- where did you go after that?",
        "A: We went to Paris in \u201966.",

        "Q: But those were pretty volatile years in Paris.",
        "A: They were very volatile. We were there during the \u201968 revolution. It was terribly\nexciting. My older daughter got -- well, I think Mary got gassed, too, coming from\nschool. Jane was in -- during this year abroad, doing the [indecipherable] Francaise.\nIt\u2019s the year abroad. This was called, yeah, it was called the year abroad, but what\nwas it? Sen -- not senior, was it fa -- it was a particular year abroad that universities\ncounted actually as a -- as a class -- as -- as a -- you -- you got credit for it. And it\nwas -- she stayed -- I mean, she lived at home, but she went to the Sorbonne and\nvarious other places for classes, French classes and I hardly saw Morris at all\nbecause he was [indecipherable]. For awhile my father was with us, too.",
        "Q: What was Morris covering at that time?",
        "A: He was covering that and then the -- the -- and -- and the Peace talks, the -- the\nVietnam Peace talks were on --",
        "Q: In Paris. Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- at the same time in Paris. But he was bureau chief.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So he was bureau chief for all of Francophone Africa and from -- for France and\nBelgium and Switzerland. So --",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: I mean, the Francophone part. And I was unfortunate -- I don\u2019t know whether I\nshould say unfortunately -- yes, unfortunately, I was the bureau chief\u2019s wife and we\nhad V.I.P.s coming in from all of Latin America, from the States and so on and I\nwas the taker around and [indecipherable] the old-fashioned show, six times of the\nsame show. And taking people shopping and all sorts of unpleasant things like that,\nit went on forever, and everything I don\u2019t want to have. I was happy when I could\nsit at home and have a meal to -- by myself with the kids, it was very, very\ndemanding. After awhile I got a little tired of all of that and I took an -- it -- I -- I --\nI took several courses. I too -- first I took a course at the -- at -- in anthropology, but\nwhat kind of anthropology? I did one with L\u00e9vi-Strauss who was doing stuff about\nthat time at the -- oh, what is it called, that -- they call it the [indecipherable] which\nwas you didn\u2019t get any kind of degrees or any kind of anything for it, but you sat\nthere and this was anthropology and what this was mostly on was -- was northwest\nCanadian Indians, and was wonderful, about the Inuits, and I had always been\ninterested in that. It was a super class, except in a -- when you think how classes are\ntaught nowadays and the way this was taught it was just incredible. Thank\n[indecipherable] was -- the building was, I don\u2019t know, probably 17\" century and\nnothing functioned at all. We started out by seeing nobody is permitted to use any\nkind of -- of recording device and someone actually went around to see what was\ngoing on. Then, as it was open and free, all sorts of hobos would come in and just\nsleep in the back there, because -- because you know, it was free, 1t was warm. And\nthen they had strange old windows that they always had problems getting the blinds\ndown and he had a assistant and they would do projections on the screen. And they\nwere invariably upside down. I mean, I don\u2019t know one time when this was straight.\nI mean, this is the leading anthropologist at that time, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and it w -\n- it w -- had a -- can\u2019t remember exactly how long the course started, who -- I was\nterribly interested in the material, I actually had Morris take me to -- to where --\nwhere this was take -- taking place. I mean, where these Indians were, and so on\nthat\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The northwest.",
        "A: -- Canadian me -- Canadian northwest was fairly fantastic. I was doing that.\nThen I took a course that was being given by an -- that was some kind of branch of -\n- | don\u2019t whether it was NYU, I\u2019m not quite sure -- that was given by the very\nfamous, and this is shameful on me, cultural anthropologist.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Shame on me. He did a wonderful thing on five Mexican families or maybe three\nMexican families at this point. I took that with a friend of mine. Then I decided to\ndo a class to teach -- to teach French. And this was mostly given by fre -- four\nFrench secondary school teachers from Les Colonie deut la mer. Colonies from\nacross th -- I mean, from the other side -- from across the oceans, let\u2019s say. And\nthey consisted fi -- of a number of high school teachers from Martinique, from very\n-- from African high schools and so on. And you know, their -- their curriculum is\nexactly, exactly the same in all of those countries as it is in France, and you can\ncount on it that on the same day the same thing, I -- I think it\u2019s still that way. The\nsame thing is being taught in -- in -- in Guadalupe, and who knows where in Africa,\nas it is in France. And the beginning of these classes when th -- st -- I mean the\nhistory classes, the history books start out by [indecipherable] our ancestors\n[indecipherable]. And I mean, you see these black ladies teaching this to these black\nchildren over there, it\u2019s quite funny. But it\u2019s a very rigorous program and -- and this\nwas taught as the special sk -- a special course for -- I guess maybe they got a little\nmore money for th -- from -- from the Ministry of Education, and they came for this\nspecialization in English.

        "Q: Uh-huh.",

There\u2019s a nice Picasso museum there.\nThere was a wonderful museum which is still there in -- in the same way as it was,\nof the city of Paris which -- with, you know, signs, butcher stores and so on, various\nguilds and everything. Beautifully done. That -- that\u2019s still there. But they now have\nall kinds of super luxury stores and this is a medieval, you know, district. And I --\njust as I said I saw a story where people absolutely shocked and horrified and as I st\n-- as they started buying up these -- these places and turning them into condos and\nturning in -- into fancy s -- modern stores, these people were being pushed out. So\nyou saw much less of that in -- in Paris.",

        "A: I really didn\u2019t want to be because you know, I had very little in common with\nFrench people, that experience wasn\u2019t the same. They\u2019re very exclusive. The French\nare very exclusive people whether -- whether they\u2019re Jewish or not. We knew of a\ncouple of Jewish families. One of them was a family that Morris had met, a French\nfamily who had interests in north Africa and he knew them from Algiers, I believe.\nThey were very upper upper middle class. Nice people, that died since, both of\nthem. And -- I-I -- I\u2019m trying to think. Yes, my -- one of -- I found out that for\ninstance, our physician who we got by recommendation of somebody was -- I think\nhe was a Moroccan Jew. My ophthalmologist was a woman and from what I can see\nher name is something something bennyshu, I think she was probably Algerian or\nMoroccan Jew, so-somebody like that, so some part of that part of the world.",

Also, I had a very good friend from\nYugoslavia, an interesting thing, from Zagreb, she used to be practically a beauty\nqueen, and she was from a mixed marriage. And I don\u2019t know exactly when she\ncame to Paris, but she did and she -- her name was Baccichin, but I don\u2019t know\nwhether this was a -- a name that had been changed at one time or another, but she\nis a hugely tall blonde woma --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",

        "A: She was from Zagreb. She was -- I knew her family pre-war, my father -- she\nwas that much older that she wasn\u2019t a friend of mine in Zagreb, she\u2019s just a -- well,\nshe was maybe three years older, maybe even four, and she was th -- one of the\nglamour girls. And she was working -- this is another interesting thing -- she was\nworking for a manufacturer, clothing manufacturer who produced knock-offs of\nChanel clothes. And she would buy the ma-material and she would, you know, get\nthis kind of extra trimming on it and that kind of short or long or whatever it was.\nBeautiful stuff. This was then sent -- this -- they had lots of American buyers,\namong others, for Sachs Fifth Avenue, where the -- at that time the things were sold\nfor 700 - 900 bucks, stuff like that. And they were produced in one of -- were in --\nin where I saw the workshop in -- in the center of Paris, but not in a -- some kind of\nelegant district. How this was done was incredible. They would bring -- she would\ngo every once in awhile to Yugoslavia and she would recruit one or two tailors and\nthey would bring half the village along. Now this was -- they were all working, you\nknow, illegally, and every so often the f -- the -- the -- the French government\nwould -- would simply raid these places, and they would go -- they would go back.\nAnd then after awhile another village",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- yeah. They were somewhere, they were actually like sweatshops, I think, they\nwere put up in -- and yet they were very anxious to come. This was beautiful stuff,\nyou know, silk lined with -- fantastically finished and so on. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine\nthat there were that many wonderful Serbian tailors, most of them were Serbs.\nWhole villages would come, and in connection with this there was a very funny --\nfunny, sad incident, what can I say? There were very many Roma at the time, many\nGypsies 1n -- in Paris, and they had an extremely bad reputation because what really\nhappened was a number of Yugoslav or other Gypsies la -- ended up in Rome or in\nItaly, and they -- they were trained by -- I gu -- guys who turned them into, you\nknow, pickpockets and this, that and the other. They lived at the end of the town\nand they really were pretty obvious everywhere, on every street. And wi -- the\nFrench police 1s not terribly kind so they, you know, everybody felt sorry for them\nuntil they were -- somebody stole something from them, lots of kids that were\npulling at your clothes and so on, and they was -- actually trained to do it. They\nwould be in Italy and that -- they -- obviously it was so easy to get somebody on a\ntrain, either from Yugoslavia or Italy or whatever and they\u2019d end up in -- in Paris\nand they were on the streets and they slept anywhere, you know, like that. And one\nday, very close to my house is this person, this Roma woman with a small child in\nher arms, and she hands me a piece of paper written on the letterhead of a convent\non the outskirts of Paris, saying so and so has been -- has a very sick husband, or\nhas been abandoned by -- by her -- by her husband and we beg of you, whoever sees\nthis to please help her and so on. This was -- you know, a little suspicious, anyhow,\nlooking, although the tone was right and the -- this was tha -- so I read this in\nFrench and she says the husband -- that she came, that she was a refugee from\nYugoslavia and so on. But I read that, I start talking Croatian to her, and she\npractically faints on the street. And I said, look, I\u2019m not going to give you any kind\nof money, I don\u2019t like the way this is going on, I mean, normally I would, but I\nreally felt badly about this whole thing. So -- as this was just across the street from\nmy house, I went and I got her clothes for her, I got masses of food, I -- you know,\nthank you, thank you very much, this 1s fine. So then two weeks later I get a call\nfrom my friend whose husband was, I think the ABC or CBS correspondent, guy by\nthe name of Bernard Redmont, who lived at another part of Paris, totally different.\nAnd h-he -- they -- you know, they were -- Redmont was in a very bad situation and\nactually had to leave the -- the States because he was implicated -- I don\u2019t know\nwhether implicated, but he was in those McCarthy trials --",

There was three ladies, Romas, but they were\ncalled Gypsies at that time still, who had come from Czechoslovakia and they had\nthese most wonderful silks. Joan had -- used to have her clothes made still, and she\nbought these I don\u2019t know how many cuts for suits and dresses and so on, all of\nwhich, you know, had been smuggled in to -- it\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just not a\nproblem for me.

One of my very intimate friends was a woman\nfrom Zagreb who -- who is a refugee. She had gone again, via Italy to Cuba, to\nMexico. And her husband, her ex-husband had been in the watch business in\nYugoslavia. And she had opened a boutique for women\u2019s clothes, and had stayed in\nMexico, she\u2019s still there. She\u2019s a few years older than I am. Her name is Sophia\nCondon. And she got divorced from her Yugoslav husband and I think he died just\nvery recently in Geneva.

        "A: That\u2019s true too, but I -- there was another great plus and that was that Morris was\nconnected to Yugoslavia. He had been there during World War II. He opened the --\nwhat was known as the American library in Belgrade and in Zagreb and he had\nmany Yugoslav friends. Very many. And that was part of it. He was interested in\nthat culture.

I went with my cousin and I remember using the computers upstairs and\nI mean, whatever it was that we -- we dredged up, Jasenovac, which I believe was\neither misspelled or something was wrong, and we were kind of put off. And then I\nwent, obviously through them -- through the permanent exhibit and everything else,\nand it was horrifying. I was also, at that time very much upset that there was hardly\nanything on Yugoslavia, very little. But then, it really isn\u2019t surprising because, you\nknow, how many Yugoslav Jews, or how many Yugoslavs really survived who\nwent through it, and there was very little left. Now, I did not mention that at the\nvery beginning, when -- when Yugoslav Jews started coming to New York er -- in\nthe 40\u2019s, they bought a plot in the -- in -- in -- in New Jersey where they formed a c1\n-- a cemetery, which is now quite full. And this apparently is very much what\nhappens, because there were groups from Germany, from Austria, from who knows,\nthe Bukovina and so on, who had plots of their own. And that\u2019s where it is, in New\nJersey, in fair -- fair -- Fairview mew -- New Jersey. And there was an association\nof Yugoslav Jews in the United States, which worked on A, helping people who --\nwho were totally, you know, bereft of everything and try -- got visas, worked with\nthe State department, worked with various other governments, helped with this\nrestitution business that I told you about. And then there was this terrible incident of\nOswego, which I don\u2019t know whether you know anything about.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t.",

        "A: \u201947, maybe? \u201946 - \u00b047 -- bringing refugees who were being given shelter in the\nUnited States and most of them were Yugoslavs. So I was sent by Voice of America\nwith some, as I said -- was about to say cameramen. There were some cameramen\nas a matter of fact, too, but mostly sound people. And we got there and this group of\npeople started coming out and they recognized me, a bunch of them, and they\nstarted asking about my brother, who -- so this was very shortly after the end of\nwar, maybe the war was still on. Yeah, the war was still -- and -- and I had to yell\nover, you know, hundreds of people to tell them there was no Mario any more. And\nthen another somebody came and so on. And they looked like absolute hell. These\nwere people who had been living in Italy and doing quite well. Had already, you\nknow, gotten things from the various Jewish organizations and had sort of pulled\nthemselves together, but here was the possibility of going to the United States, so\nwow, great. And it was great, in the end. But they came and they were not allowed -\n- we were behind -- we had barricades, this was yelling through barricades. First\nthing that happened when they arrived, they made -- before they arrived, they made\nthem give all the clothes, which these people had bought with whatever was left\nover, let\u2019s, you know, do a bella figura when you arrive here. And they were thrown\ninto 1 -- 1 -- it\u2019s -- 1-1t to be a -- deloused and [indecipherable]. So you got rags.\nEverything lost its color. They sprayed them with DDT, all these people, I don\u2019t\nknow whether it -- probably DDT, it was awful, they were delousing them and so\non. So these were people who had been living a more or less normal life in Italy,\nwho suddenly came. So then it was this big committee, they took them to Oswego\ninto an ex-army camp and put them behind wires -- I mean, behind -- behind -- I\nthink there was even, if I\u2019m not mistaken a -- a -- you know, wire. And was a big\nscandal. And I remember my father, who at that time I think was the vice-president\nor whatever, secretary of this association of Yugoslav Jews that were going there to\ntry to calm these people down, who were ju -- a great many were Yugoslav Jews,\nnot all, but a great many as this -- you know, they -- they picked them up 1n Italy,\nthese -- these people had already been saved, I mean, you know. They were in no\ndanger. And so first, you know, this -- this was a whole [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t\nknow exactly how -- well, they fe -- 1t got to be where the point where Mrs.\nRoosevelt went there to intervene and one day one of these people turned\nthemselves up -- turned up at our door, one of the women who knew where I was,\nabout maybe two or three years younger than I am. Friend of my brothers. Suddenly\nshe was at our front door in New York on Riverside Drive, and she spent the night\nwe -- my father and sister, she had to go back because otherwise she would have\nbeen, I don\u2019t know, I guess a criminal or whatever.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: And finally with -- I don\u2019t know exactly how long they stayed there -- but there\nwas a film about them, about this ship coming over. Maybe Ruth Grube or someone\nlike that worked on it and they -- as I said quo -- many many of -- there -- there\u2019s\nsome of them still here, one of them 1s a woman who lives in -- in Baltimore, who --\nwho was a -- a child then, a little girl and so on.

And I think this was really\nbehind his thinking most of the time. And if not -- and you know, he was terribly\nhurt -- I can\u2019t [indecipherable] I can\u2019t describe the trauma of a father losing an only\nson, although I was extremely close to my father, it wasn\u2019t that I felt, you know, in\nany way because I was a girl that -- that I counted for any less.

        "Q: And the life he left behind.",
        "A: Yes. No, I don\u2019t think he ever really worried about that too much. It -- it was a --\nyou know, it was a paternalistic st -- society altogether, and I felt strange echoes of\nthis much later. I came, for instance, to Belgrade and we saw Morris\u2019s secretary,\nwho was an old lady, and who recently died -- I think she may have been a hun --\njust under a hundred. She was the oldest person born in Belgrade who died. So she\nwas probably 98 or so. She had been evacuated during World War I, to England. So\nanyhow, he go -- he -- Morris, when they opened this reading room there, this lady\nVera Wynik was one of the secretaries and they -- she had a terrible time because of\nthe communists wanted -- were -- were threatening her in a horrible way. They --\nthey wanted whatever secrets, there were no secrets, but they wanted all kinds of\ninformation, which she refused to give. And they were harassing her to an awful --\nin an awful way, and Morris -- Morris felt -- heard about it later, and he didn\u2019t\nknow, I mean, she was about to commit suicide, and it\u2019s a very sad story. So he was\nvery close to her and he -- he was constantly in touch here and we -- she gave me\nsome of those icons that were there, and -- so, a wonderful woman, whom we\nvisited in Belgrade all -- the first time we went back. And she said to me, do -- I-I\u2019m\ngoing back to the paternalistic societies that were going on then -- she said to me,\nyou know, when your father came to visit me, he -- because my father went back to\nYugoslavia way before we did and Morris said, would you please visit Vera Wynik,\ngiver her my love, see what she needs and so on. Do that. Fine.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",

        "A: Apparently, before my father came to visit, they already knew -- somebody from\nthe secret service came to see her and said -- or maybe -- maybe he had just either\nphoned her or they got together at the very beginning, and said I understand that\nManfred Sternberg has come to visit you. What have you got with Manfred\nSternberg? And apparently she said, he is the broth -- he is the -- the father-in-law\nof an old friend of ours and so on, who was so and so. They knew anyhow. And this\nke -- person kept insisting and insisting and insisting, a very high up person in the --\nin -- in the Secret Service, the OZNA, which was the scary thing, I mean that was\nthe secret police in spades. Turns out that this was a boy who my father had given\nscholarships to. He was -- I knew nothing about this, absolutely nothing. He was the\nson of the workman in -- outside, where the factory was, outside Zagreb, and he was\napparently a talented kid, whom his parents, I think after, I mean, four years or fi --\nof -- of -- or whatever it was, I think maybe it was six years of -- of -- of elementary\nschool, pulled out of school and he would have probably been, you know, working\non the fi -- in the fields or whatever. And my father knew that this was a very smart\nkid, and he apparently gave him a scholar -- gave -- gave the parents, I don\u2019t know,\nthe money for this kid to go -- go through high school. And this was then some\ngreat big -- I mean, he went through the partisans and so on. And he kept asking\nVera Wynik about me, and that if ever I ca -- and the next time, when we came, he\nknew exactly when that we were coming and he asked Vera to -- for me to get in\ntou -- I -- I had no idea who this was. I mean, when I heard the name I knew he was\nsomebody from -- from -- from the village. I mean, where would I be interested for\na little boy who was three or four years younger than I was, you know? He knew\nabout my brother. He knew absolutely everything. And I found out that my father\nhad sent him through school, you know, forever. And I know we were never\npermitted to be near anything like that with the -- the -- you know, they had these\nChristmas things where kids got dressed for winter and you know, and clothes and\nbooks, and this, that and the other, which we weren\u2019t -- had no idea about them. We\nwere totally excluded because these were kids, you know, some of them were in\nschool with us at the same time, some were younger.",

Finally I met him, the\nsecond time I came back and she was saying something to me that, you know, I was\na very young woman then. She said -- Vera said, you know he\u2019s got some kind of a\nnotion about you and he is sure to be disappointed. I don\u2019t know whether you need\nto see him. He is not -- I don\u2019t know, I guess maybe he\u2019s still alive. He finally --\nwhen I came back the first time to the village, one of the village women told me\nthat, you know so and so?

        "A: N-No, because -- yeah, I -- I was reading papers, I w -- I was in touch with\npeople. Every once in awhile I would -- I would hear from friends and there would\nbe snide remarks, wherever I was there were snide remarks about Croats. In\nBelgrade there were more than snide remarks, in Zagreb about people in Belgrade.\nNot to mention that I guess whatever was a communist party that at one time may\nhave been very idealistic or certainly, you know, that had deteriorated into all sorts\nof unpleasant things. And there was some really unpleasant consumption goi -- you\ngop -- you know, there -- there was money being spent on -- on -- on these huge\nhotels that were being built in -- 1n -- in -- say in Dubrovnik was importing\nbathroom fixtures instead of trying to, you know, bring your own.

You would be hired, and you would go there for six\nweeks or -- or -- or three months or whatever and then somebody said you don\u2019t\nneed to come tomorrow any more. And you know, I -- I could survive, but there\nwere people who were doing this who could not survive, and they were all over the\nplace. And I taught maybe in three or four of them anywhere in Arlington, some\nwere even further out.",

Then there were a couple of women from -- and\nthere the -- the Croatian Serbian, they also exploded very often in a very strange\nway, because [indecipherable] people who were teaching who wa -- who was\nteaching along with me was this -- they were teaching Croatian and they were\nteaching Serbian, you had both things. Everybody was politically involved one way\nor another and there was a young Serbian priest who harassed some smart American\nwomen who were working in the Defense department. He harassed them to the\npoint where they were weeping, and -- and then went to somebody and said wasn\u2019t\nwork -- couldn\u2019t quite work out what -- what I was, I mean, you\u2019re not a Croatian,\nyou\u2019re not na -- you know, like that.

        "A: Might be 80\u2019s, early 80\u2019s? Started off a very nice guy who became head of the --\nwhen it was still a Yugoslav desk, but then it became divided into Croatian, and the\nSlovenian desk was always apart, but suddenly we had a -- a Croatian desk and a\nSerbian desk and a this and a that and speakers from all over. And I was doing\ntranslations there. No, it started out as follows, one [indecipherable] this guy, this\nfriend of ours had just retired and turned over -- he\u2019s a Serb from Belgrade who\nMorris also gave his first job. He was a prisoner of war in Germany and Morris\ngave him a first job. And then it turned out he was one of the best friends of my\ncousin\u2019s husband.

        "A: Yes, Slavko Tutorovich. He\u2019s alive, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s in -- here. His wife was my best\nfriend for a long time here, she died unfortunately of cancer and I miss her terribly.\nHe -- very conservative person, but nevermind, was -- both of them, and now has\nturned out to be really a Serb Nationalist who -- I won\u2019t go into that, we don\u2019t talk\nabout that because when we go talk about that, that\u2019s the end. But -- and -- and\nthere\u2019s a lot of conspi -- conspiracy theory about America really, I mean, is in\ncahoots with everybody against the Serbs. So, that\u2019s -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t want to -- but,\nwe said, the problem is, you know, talking about something else. But he\u2019s very nice\notherwise. Anyhow, at first I was doing -- I was given the scripts and I was doing\ntranslations here and just turning them over to the [indecipherable] just -- I hate to\nsay what kind of garbage lot -- I mean, what kind of -- of -- of -- you know, waste\nof time, money, whatever you want, these things were. It was just awful, especially\nthe [indecipherable]. They\u2019re filled with nothing. Like for instance -- trying to\nthink.

        "A: Mm-hm. [tape break]. You know, 10 minute, 15 -- 10 -- 10 minute feature, I\nthink. Very boring. But they were in Croatian and I was the Croatian voice, okay?\nSo then after awhile some of the women, and I think they -- they were right, one of\nthe Serbian woman decided that my voice was too old. I can\u2019t agree more. A -- you\n-- you can tell. Although this was maybe 10 years ago. But yes, if you listen to it\nyou can tell this is not a young person. Okay, doesn\u2019t matter.

I don\u2019t know how long this had been going on. And this young man was in\nthe process of publishing a book on the Croatian peasant party, which he eventually\ndid in English, and was very good. I think it was very good.

And he\nhad met both Goldsteins, and Ivo Goldstein is also a historian and he told them,\nlisten, you just simply have to go there and -- and push and say and get in touch\nwith so and so. He didn't do it. He is working for the Canadian government now and\ntrying to get another academic job and I hope he gets it. This is a nice young man\nbut -- but -- but not sufficiently, let\u2019s say aggressive in that way. Also, he asked me\nseveral times did I know Dr. Mirjana Gross. A-And Mirjana Gross is my friend\nFaya\u2019s childhood friend. I didn\u2019t know her, but I knew who she was.

There were some eyewitness stories\nand so on done by a guy who lives in London who\u2019s a Sephardic Jew. And I can\u2019t\nremember his name right now, but he did it for the museum.

Sometimes it was postponed by a year if you happened to\nbe a student, but no, in fact, when we left he had just finished his one year, he --\nswaggering around in a very elegant uniform, with boots and so on. Very, very\ngood looking. And -- although, I really wa -- you know, he was decorative, I wasn\u2019t\nin love or anything like that, but maybe he was, I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\nbut you know, he -- we went out a few -- we went out, you know, f -- we went out\nfrom here to there together. It\u2019s the going out that was going on and -- and he\naccompanied me under the guidance of everybody else to balls and there\u2019s a thing\nwhen you were 18. Until you were 18 you didn\u2019t count as a human being. And\nwhen you were 18 you went to the journalists ball, and then you were launched.\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Yeah, you mentioned that in your other interview, then you hated that.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s a parade, oh, I hated that. Absolutely hated it. But anyhow, he -- this\nyoung man was a law student, just finishing, I guess, not even that. And he was\ncaught with the first group of people, the first group of young Jewish -- and then I\nguess whatever pro [indecipherable] boys who were there, but mostly Jewish, I\nbelieve. And they were taken to a -- to two camps. But anyhow, he was -- finally he\nended up in a camp in the Velebit mountains. And he came -- and this was told to\nsomebody who was -- who wa -- who was there, he -- this is told by a guy who --",
        "Q: Saw.",
        "A: -- saw it. Who, by the way was a big -- became a career Yugoslav officer, he was\na colonel. And he was a sports person in Zagreb, I think he was a skiing champion\nor whatever, something like that. So, this group was taken to this camp. And as he\nhad just pre -- previously been in the Yugoslav army, he knew that area and he was\ntelling these guys, oh I know where this is, this is not bad, lik -- we\u2019 ll -- we\u2019ll --\nwe'll try and get, you know, get together and all of these things, and maybe it will\nwork out and so on. And as he was taken to this prison, a fr -- somebody from the\nsame year of law school, not a friend but somebody he knew, who became a UstaSa\nofficer, I believe, or maybe n -- anyhow, he was there and saw him. And being a\nnice person, he wrote his parents say -- saying I saw Dragon today at such and such\na place. He didn\u2019t say he\u2019s alive, but that was obvious. They were a fairly prominent\nfamily and -- and the parents took a postcard and wrote him a postcard saying,\nwe're in Zagreb, hope you\u2019re okay, that\u2019s it.

She said these women were coming in and they were\nobviously from town because they were walking with their pocket -- they had\npocketbooks.

And one of the things, of course, was that he was part of that consti -- it\nwasn\u2019t a concern, it wa -- th -- this group of -- of agricultural manufacturers of\nalcohol that were -- that -- that was a -- what should I say, I -- it was a thi -- wi -- I -\n- | will say a -- you know, an organization that got together and so on. And he -- he\nwas part of it and he was absolutely a miserable businessman and my father tried to\nteach him what business was and so on. And he had a particular significance for me\nbecause I\u2019d known him from, you know, childhood on. That point I was maybe 15\nand came in and we shook hands and he kissed my hand and I knew I\u2019d grown up. I\n-- | -- maybe I had just come back from England, maybe I was 16. Boy, I really had\nit. And I thought he was a bachelor the rest -- for all my life, I was very -- we were\nclose, I mean, Father was with him all the time. Not all the time, but often. When\nI\u2019m here at a Slovistics conference, sitting and listening to something, and I had my\ntooth pulled just a couple of days earlier and I was still under all kinds of -- had\nbeen taking all kinds of -- of -- of -- of painkillers and I thought I wasn\u2019t in my right\nmind. I come to this one room and presenting is a Slovistics professor called Joseph\nBombale. So I said, have I gone out of my mind? This was a bachelor when I left.\nHe was -- he was killed in Jasenovac also, by the way. And rightly so. And I went\nto him, I said, what\u2019s going on? And I said, is your aunt so and so? Countess Nun-\nNundine? Married a swi -- a -- a Dutch what would you call it, a dut -- a Dutch\ndiplomat. He said yes. I said, is your aunt so and so, Josephine? He said yes. I said,\nmy God, I thought Joseph Bombale was a bachelor. And he said, that does not mean\nanything. And then I talked some more to him. He knew exactly where, what and so\non.",

And -- which my father knew, that they\u2019d been\nthere.

I would have to look it up exactly how to say -- how it\nworked out. And this good friend of ours was playing two sides.",

At one\ntime my father had a -- wa-was in something -- I won\u2019t say -- s-say [indecipherable]\nbut in the alcohol business --",
        "A: -- and in a vineg -- he had a vinegar factory in Liublyana. So, he had some notion\nof -- of this -- of a very little. And so they were there, I think my father -- I\u2019m not\nquite sure what year my father sold it out, but it was very traumatic for him, I must\nsay. And particularly negotiations with the union was quite funny.",
        "A: They bought an existing business, yes.",
        "A: They actually made mustard for various well-known mustard firms, I -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t tell you -- I mean, there were various brands and so on.

        "A: No, I think he mostly invested in real estate and by that time we had already\ngotten -- he -- he\u2019d started working on -- on this project of getting -- getting the\ncompensation from the Yugoslav government and so on, so --",
        "A: -- no.",
        "A: Yes. The royal Yugoslav government had deposited in the United States a\nserious sum -- I mean a serious amount of gold, I guess it must have been ingots, or\nwhatever you called gold. And after awhile the Tito government wanted to --\nwanted to get this gold back to Yugoslavia and United States said yes, after you\nhave compensated United States businesses that were there pre-war, and s-some of\nour -- an-and our citizens, American citizens whose -- whose property was\nnationalized. And, as they had nationalized a number of things, number of\nbuildings, number of factories and so on [indecipherable] Yugoslavia after the war.\nWe -- we were within this particular group of people. And this went on for several\nyears and finally -- finally a lump sum came, and then I guess mostly he -- he -- he\ntraveled a great deal, he -- actually he did the trip around the world with some\nfriends, and --",
        "A: Also my -- no --",
        "A: -- no. Simply because, for instance my -- my -- my mother\u2019s house, which is\nright in the center of Zagreb, supposedly very historic, it was built by her great-\ngrandfather. In fact, this was built -- when this house was being built, Jews were\nstill not allowed to have property, real estate property in Zagreb. But by the time it\nwas finished -- so it star -- it was built under the name of the architect, was a very\nfamous architect by the name of Felbinger.

I mean, yes, he -- he did, I mean, he and a lawyer and\nso on, it took a great deal of time and cu -- and he had to travel to Washington a\ngreat deal and so on. But this was done through a lawyer here who -- who -- whose\nname I don\u2019t re-recall right now, but was an American lawyer who dealt with this\nand with numerous oth -- not too many, but other people who had arrived about the\nsame time we did, and some a little earlier. Not many who arrived later, because\nfirst of all there was this cut-up -- cut off date and secondly we arrived just -- we\ncrossed the border from --from Austria to Switzerland on the day that the -- the --\nthe -- Belgrade was bombed, so you know, if we had been caught we would have\nbeen obviously in bad shape.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes -- yes -- yes, I was very happy to be there because -- 1n a way, of course I\nwas sad, because as soon as we started getting news of what was going on, it was\nvery painful. But -- but there was a lot of hope still going on. There was a\ngovernment in exile which was [indecipherable] that was in -- in -- in London and\nthen came back into the United States. We th -- both my brother and I thought this\nwas really fun. We arrived in New York and we stayed in a -- in a -- a what do you\ncall it, an apartment hotel, it was da -- it was on 57\" and Sixth. It was called The\nSalisbury, it was like two or three rooms and a little kitchen in a closet, and a -- and\nof course, you know, they cleaned up and gave you the -- and gave you fresh\nlaundry and so on and there were pa -- I think there were two bedrooms and some\nkind of a living room and so on. And I remember going to a five and 10 cents store\nand we bought all of this crazy china, very cheap stuff, and like four plates and four\nspoons and so on. And it was sort of like playacting almost. Nobody was aware of\nreally what was going on and how it was going to happen. There was -- we knew, of\ncourse, that there were Jews being taken to concentration camps in Austria and\nGermany, but there was no talk of death camps, and there were none at that time, I\ndon\u2019t believe. And so, we were there. Also, at the same time, this gentleman who\nwas in the mustard business with my father, who was from Belgrade, he -- they\ncame -- no, they may have arrived just a little earlier than we did. There was a girl\nwho was about, I don\u2019t know, two, three ye -- two years younger than I am, and a\nboy who was maybe a year or two younger than my brother. And it was fun. My\nmother didn\u2019t have the faintest notion about cooking. This very nice Mrs. Shanser\ntaught her to cook. By that time we had moved to a nice furnished place in river --\nin Riverdale in New York. Do you know where that is, across from [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- but anyhow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s almost on the border of Scarsdale and well,\nWestchester county, or whatever. And they had this very nice apartment building\nthat had a bus taking you to the -- to the subway if you wanted it, several times a\nday, and to the little grocery, to -- to shopping [indecipherable] was where my\nmother used to go with this friend who was teaching her how to cook. And\nhowever, when we got there, we discovered that there really -- we didn\u2019t have\nenough knives and forks and we couldn\u2019t function very well with whatever we had,\nthese four spoons and so on. And that place did not have any tablecloth or any -- it -\n- it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually, the furniture was quite nice, and it was large\nand quite pleasant. So then my father went to an auction in New York. And this was\na extremely sad thing that I\u2019m still -- that is still terribly painful to me. He went to\nthe New York docks, wi -- where there were numerous cra -- not crates, what you\ncall the -- what do you call these things that you send large amounts of furniture,\nhousehold goods?",
        "A: Contains.",
        "A: Okay.

And he bought this almost sight\nunseen -- in fact, sight unseen stuff, which then was brought home and I still have\nit, but this -- now it\u2019s going to go [indecipherable]. Very, very elaborate -- if you\nwant I\u2019Il show you the thing because it\u2019s kind of amusing -- china, which was\nobviously bought by a family that was moving to the States with you know, what\ncan we buy that -- that -- of German goods that I -- we\u2019re permitted to take out and\nso on.",
        "A: So this is just a lot of gold and a lot -- I'll show it to you -- thing, which we used\nfor everyday use. I think we were cutting things and so on. I mean, our -- our china\nat home was very nice china, but it wasn\u2019t elaborate, I mean was -- it was okay, it\nwas --",
        "A: -- It was a -- we -- we thought this was really fun, both my brother and I. And\nthen one day -- there\u2019s all sorts of stories about it -- one day somebody said, do you\nknow how much this stuff is worth? I said, absolutely no idea, I mean, this is what -\n- yeah, this is what we use. Although we thought it was quite funny that it was as --\nas -- as elaborate as it was. So finally we decided okay, we need to do -- put this\naside. However, later on we did use for slightly better stuff, slightly better\noccasions, this china. And one day -- by that time the government in exile had --\nfrom Yugoslavia, had left London or some parts of 1t and were in London -- were in\nNew York. And as ours was really just about the only family --",
        "A: -- intact, and you know, we didn\u2019t live in a -- in a hotel, all of these guys whose\nwives were left either in Zagreb or in Belgrade and whatever, would congregate and\ncome and have coffee with us and -- and kugelhupf and things like that. And by -- I\ndon\u2019t know, this wasn\u2019t at the time, yet maybe it was, that Albina Padovan had\ncome from -- no, I\u2019d -- I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t think so. Anyhow, we were having, I\nremember as today, there were about five or six various ministers of one kind or\nanother. One of them was the minister of -- of the post office, who was a -- who --\nwho -- who had gone to the -- to a -- to a Franciscan seminary, but who became the\nminister of, as I said, of the post -- of post offices in th -- and was a friend, very\nclose friend of my father\u2019s from childhood days. So he was there, and then there\nwas a guy by the name of Gavrilovic who was a -- who was the Minister of Finance.\nHe hadn\u2019t a been, but I\u2019m -- I think he was pre-war, pre -- pre-war, I think he was\nthe -- a congressman in Belgrade. That was Gavrilovic. And there were several\nothers. And then there were some people, some refugees who had meanwhile come\nfrom Belgrade and -- via Cuba, which was another way that people were coming in.",
        "A: And they got into -- and I had -- this was at the time when there was a\nparticularly horrible story going on with Draza Mihailovic and -- and -- and -- and -\n- and Tito. And it was at the time when the Germans were killing every 10\" child or\nevery 10\" male in one of the cities. And I remember coming back from work and\nthey\u2019re s-standing there and suddenly they got into a horrible fight. One was with a\ncake knife and the other had his -- had the -- a chair, trying to ward off -- I -- I don\u2019t\nremember who was doing what. One of them fainted, and my mother and I just\ndisappeared into the maid\u2019s room and locked ourselves up because we didn\u2019t want\nto be part of this whole story.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was a temporary situation.",
        "A: It was so much a temporary situation that I actually thought when I was --\nmarried Morris, that he was going back on his job and I was going with him. And\nthen he had to resign and [indecipherable]",

        "A: And at that time I guess there was some broadcasting going on, but I had very\nlittle to do with it. What I did was, I was in something called the media analysis\nsection and with me it mostly consisted of sitting in the public library in New York\ndoing research on the number of speakers of [indecipherable] or -- or -- or -- or\nSerbian or whatever. But I remember mostly it was African and -- and -- and -- and\nAsian languages. I wasn't terribly good at it, but anyhow I did do it. And then this\nmo -- merfed -- morphed, is the word, morphed into a -- into the -- first 1t was called\n-- this was only called va -- as I said, coordinator -- coordinator of information and\nthen it became -- it wasn\u2019t still Voice of America, forget what it was called. It was -\n- that was an in between thing. My husband was in the same building and I didn\u2019t\nknow him at all.",
        "A: This was in New York, yeah.",
        "A: There wa -- there -- there was broadcasting going on mostly from London, and\nthere was a man who was a Serb who had lived -- a Yugoslav, but he was a Serb,\nwho had lived in Paris and had been doing broadcasting 1n a very interesting way.\nWe always listened to him in Zagreb, pro-allies and so on. And as the French -- he\nfinally got evacuated and left -- and ended up in New York and continued\nbroadcasting from -- not Voice of America, but what was the pla -- I\u2019m trying to\nthink of what it was called, it wasn\u2019t -- 1t was - 1t was not yet Voice of America, it\nwas coordinator of information. Office of War Information --",
        "A: -- was what it was called, yeah, okay. So within the Office of War Information,\nthen we got Voice of America. Morris was in a totally different thing and I didn\u2019t\neven know he -- he existed. So this Serbian broadcaster ended up in New York.",
        "A: Yes, it was Peter Petrovich. How did you know that?",
        "A: Aha.",
        "A: Okay. So s -- Peter Petrovich, who was quite -- I mean, he was very royalist and\nso on, but at that time there was nothing else. I mean, they a -- we just had started\nhearing slowly that there were two movements going on in Yugoslavia. So anyhow,\nI at -- I was -- my job was translating -- I think he -- I don\u2019t know whether it was a\n15 minute broadcast or longer, half hour, it seemed endless, I\u2019Il tell you that. I was\ngiven -- he would -- he would provide a script. And I had to translate that script and\nthis all went into broadcast control or whatever it was called.",
        "A: From Serbian to English, right.",
        "A: First of all he didn\u2019t speak English, but certainly he wouldn\u2019t have bothered\ntranslating. I mean he was -- he was something of a -- of a star. And he probably\nwould have been bad anyhow. I was -- I was employed there, okay, what are we\ngoing to let her do? At that time I think I was working for something called the\nBalkan section that was being run by a -- first by an Albanian, and then by a Greek,\nthere were no Yugoslavs in left or right, except for me. And I translate at -- at the --\nget this material and -- and in -- I would get it maybe the night before, I\u2019m not quite\nsure. Come in in the morning, I would trans -- I would read it and then I\u2019d translate\nit and I would -- this was then submitted and then he would do his thing. So one day\nhe got very sick, he got pneumonia, but they didn\u2019t want to stop the broadcasts and\nhe didn\u2019t want to stop the broadcasts. And he wrote the fine scripts and I translated\nthem and I voiced them, saying that I was doing this, you know, in the name of, and\nit always ended with long live his highness, kin -- King Peter of Yugoslavia, along\nwith the -- Draza Mihailovic, I mean, that whole event. So --",
        "A: So this -- this -- this was it. So then finally a section, a Serbo-Croatian section\nwas sSe-set up and a very nice person by the name of Milan Hatzuk, who was a --\noriginally from Zagreb, but who had worked as a journalist in Belgrade for awhile.\nAnd I don\u2019t know when he came to the States, I think before we did -- who was\nthere and got the job. He was not an American citizen yet, but almost. All of us\nwere, you know, sort of -- nobody knew what was going to go, we were we -- some\nof us were -- of course, I mean, I -- I was about to become an American citizen, I\nhad, you know, first papers and the works --",
        "A: -- and so on, so I had very little problems, but we had to be supervised by an\nAmerican and that was it.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Then they had a women\u2019s program finally.",
        "A: Which was kind of fun, which I th -- which I actually heard from friends who\nhad heard that I was [indecipherable]. I always felt that it was pretty stupid stuff\nbecause -- because, you know, people really did expose themselves. They could\nhave been killed for listening. This -- this was -- this was a very funny thing. This\nwas done -- some of them I did, but they weren\u2019t very interesting. I mean, some\nsuggestions they had, fairly boring. [indecipherable] I used supposedly for interest\nfor women. It was very hard to find any -- whoever was at that time I think was a\nsecretary of -- of labor, a woman in the States [indecipherable]",
        "A: Perkins.",
        "A: And a number of things of that kind. You know, you tried to do something that\nwasn\u2019t really just stupid, and did it. And this was -- this was beamed to BBC. And\nthen BBC several hours later would -- would beam it --",
        "A: -- to Yugoslavia. And as I said I heard from friends who had heard me and so on,\nalthough I didn\u2019t go by my name.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: Sorell.",
        "A: S-o-r-e-l-l. So then -- which is the name that my brother then --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] And this was kind of fun. It was am-amusing because I would\ncome to me -- I would come home and then I would turn on the BBC, I could hear\nmyself several hours later, but at that ti -- you know, and then we had these things\nof -- of -- of dictation speed because of sunspots.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t broadcast --",
        "A: -- at a normal speed.",
        "A: [indecipherable] very slowly and then there were things that had to be in -- there\nwere some things that were worthwhile. You would -- you would broadcast, you\nwould hear, for instance, when there was some kind of important action back, or\nwhatever.",
        "A: And you would have reference to it so that they would know that one knows here\nthat this is going on [indecipherable] business.",
        "A: Sure.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Not really, because I -- I think it was mostly intimations of -- you would say the\n-- the brave fighters in such and such a place, that so on, so on, one is aware of it, or\nsomething like that.",
        "A: Th-There were intima -- there wa -- there was no direct stuff.",
        "A: So finally tha -- I mean, this was part of the stuff that I was doing. Meanwhile\nthere was a very nice Yugoslav desk that was set up that had a Slovene, a -- the --\nthe head of the desk, who was this very nice guy from Bel -- originally from\nZagreb, but then later in -- who was a journalist in Belgrade, his name was Hatzuk.\nAnd then there was a very old lady and she seemed even much older than that. She\nwas the mother of a very famous ballerina here, by the name of Pasha Mira. And --\na Yugoslav, bu -- good, I mean, well-known. And she had been the wife of what\noriginally was the [speaks foreign language here] which would be the director of the\nmain Zagreb theater -- well [indecipherable] let\u2019s say th-the equivalent of the\ndirector of -- of the Kennedy Center, because everything took place there, drama\nand comedy and -- and everything. So, very old lady, who had been in the States for\nawhile, and she was supposed to be translating and she was not very good. And then\nwe did future stories of unbelievable boredom to me. And then other things and y-\nyou used to have -- of course you -- you had a headline thing, and then you had a\nfeature and then you had another feature and so on. So for awhile I was -- I was the\nannouncer of, you know, I was the in-between person, you know, you have ju -- you\nhave heard Voice of America, huh?",
        "A: Okay, that kind of business. And -- and I was translating. I was doing a little bit\nof writing and I was doing a lot of translating because whatever we did -- this was\non ditto paper, have you ever seen ditto paper? It was ab -- obnoxious stuff that was\nblue, here. And you would type on that and then this was taken to some kind of a\nmachine and that was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And all my pants and everything that I wore was blue. Underwear, everything\nwas -- you couldn\u2019t get -- nails. Terrible. Then a very nice woman -- okay, excuse\nme. [tape break] What can I tell you? [indecipherable] Okay, so then a very nice\nwoman by the name of Mary Vucedic came in. Mary Vucedic had been working for\nwhom I had met in Zagreb, who was a few years older than me -- not quite a few\nyears older than me, who died recently in New York, who was married to a Croat,\nwho worked as [indecipherable] a Croat aristocrat, Lemaniti Vucedic, who\n[indecipherable] her to the n\" degree and finally she got divorced. And then we --\nyou know, we went through all of these terrible things. Her father was killed in a --\nin Rome in one of the prisons in Rome, in [indecipherable] was that big -- can you\nimagine giving that name to a -- to -- to a prison? Okay. So that\u2019s where he was\nkilled. He\u2019s an older gentleman. Her mother survived and I don\u2019t know how, she\nwas a very unpleasant and very demanding German Jewish person. Then there was -\n- finally we got somebody by -- by the name of Robert Rosenberg, who had been in\nthe U.S. Army. How he got there, from Tusili in Bosnia, he ended up in the United\nStates Army and was -- I think he got TB or whatever, he was demobilized. And he\nappeared in our midst and we were told, this is a veteran, you give him a job\nwhatever he does. And I will not say that he was -- he was illiterate, but he wasn\u2019t\nvery good either. He was no intellectual. And he -- but, he spoke absolutely\nclassical, beautiful Croatian, which he spoke [indecipherable]",
        "A: All of those nice places in Bosnia, I mean, gorgeous. And all of us sort of had --\nZagreb does not have a very nice dialect. And although you spoke standard Serbo-\nCroatian, 1t comes through, you can tell where people are from. Then there was a th\n-- this -- our boss spoke Serbian, although he wasn\u2019t a Serb, but he had lived in\nBelgrade for many times. Then there was a Slovene who had his own broadcast and\nhe tried to keep as far away from us as he could, and -- and --",
        "A: Some things never change. And -- but he -- he was okay. But as I said, wa -- then\nthere was somebody, a middle aged Croat, he seemed very old to me at that time, by\nthe name of Gospodin Katosic. And he later became the head of the desk because\nHerzog decided to join Encyclopedia Britannica films, and did that. Which was very\nsmart. And this went on for awhile, and always the same stuff and so on. Very -- not\ninteresting at all, but very hard. And then later there were various young men that\ntook me out. One, you know -- and I\u2019m just thinking of what -- there was somebody\nby the name of Duncan McDougal junior from the -- from way up in the mountains\nof North Carolina, whose a great, great -- actually, he was th -- my first boss when -\n- in the media analysis section. And he knew a great deal about jazz, so he would\ntake me to the village [indecipherable] and all of these nice things and taught me a\nlot of stuff like that. And I\u2019m just thinking now, two o\u2019clock in the morning he\nwould put me -- and I never thought anything about it, nor did my parents, on the\nsubway in New York, I would go all the way to almost the Bronx there, and then I\nwould take a shuttle bus to the house and it would be three o\u2019clock in the morning\nwhen I came to work, and 1 -- nobody even thought that this might not be very\ngood.",
        "A: That\u2019s how safe New York was.",
        "A: And then I had a very wonderful friend there whose husband -- whose second\nhusband ma -- later became the Polish ambassador to the United States, and he was\nin the U.N. with a very high job, and he was am-ambassador in London and so on.\nAnd she and I would walk through Central Park West at 11 o\u2019clock at -- I mean,\nthrough Central Park at the -- in the middle of the night, from 47 -- I mean from --\nwhat was the address on Broadway and a -- and -- and 57\" Street to her place, she\nwas somewhere near, I don\u2019t know, 72\u2122 Street and who knows where on the West\nSide.",

He had come on leave and he came to tell us he was\nworking for -- well, it wasn\u2019t e -- it wasn\u2019t Voice of America, and wasn\u2019t -- well, 1-it\nwas OWI in a way, but it -- they were attached to OSS, I believe, and so they were\nin uniform, these guys. And he --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t think he wa -- at least he never told me, maybe he was. I\u2019m not\nasking.",
        "A: Anyhow, and he --",
        "A: No, no. And he came to tell us how w -- how our broadcast works -- were --\nwere -- were deemed by the Serbs, by the locals one way or another, what we\nshould do one way or another and so on. By that time I was engaged to somebody\nvery funny by the name of Raven McDavid, junior, whose father at the time was the\n-- what was he -- was -- he was -- he wasn\u2019t the governor of South Carolina, but the\nfirst one under, what was the name of it?",
        "A: Yeah, Lieutenant governor. And I had gone there to visit and -- and I was taken\nto [indecipherable] to meet the governor and so on, I was very embarrassed\n[indecipherable] was terrible. Anyhow, I was enga -- I was -- I was --",

I had gone there with my uncle, officially, to Greenville, South\nCarolina and so on and I didn\u2019t even [indecipherable] the assembled guests at this --\nit wasn\u2019t a banquet, it was serious dinner with the na -- with the guys ex-nanny\nserving with white gloves still, around, and then after the dinner he drove her home\nto her place. It was a very strange thing. He was a very good scholar, he was an\nexcellent scholar and he married somebody at the University of Chicago and I\u2019m\nsure this was much better than anything he could have had with me. Plus, my\nmother couldn\u2019t stand him. Okay, and anyhow I was -- I was going to marry this\nguy, and then, you know, Morris turned up and we -- we were both thinking we\nwere going to go back together to Belgrade, he knew a bunch of people, you know,\nhe kept mentioning, that I had known there. And told us what we did right, what we\ndid wrong and then we started going out and we thought we were going back, and\nthen of course it was impossible. I couldn\u2019t and he -- he quit because I couldn\u2019t go\nback and then he started working -- or no -- or -- or -- or trying to find jobs in\nvarious other places. But he was there -- he -- he had gone to Bari, that\u2019s where he\nwas mostly -- no, that\u2019s where he-he was in Bar -- fi-first he was in Algiers. He had\nflown to Algiers and then they bought up these various broadcast stations and did\nleaflets and stuff [indecipherable]. And God, when you think how young they were.",
        "A: 1946, I believe it is.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He couldn\u2019t find a job. It was very, very difficult to find a job. He was told by\nseveral people to change his name. This was a very difficult time for -- there was a\nlot of social discrimination. We had one of the most awful things that he kept\nblaming himself and [indecipherable] just awful. About a year or so, I mean a year\nand a half, my mother was still in mourning and so [indecipherable] had been sick\nand friends of ours, non-Jews had told us why don\u2019t you go t -- so and so in\nTennessee, there was a very nice country hotel in the -- and by that time I was\nmarried already -- go up there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Then we got there and when we signed in they said they didn\u2019t have any room.\nAnd I -- we had to restrain Morris, he wanted to go and, you know, strangle this\npoor pe -- person at the desk.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t, and finally, you know we left.",
        "A: But that was that and then you know, there were -- there were -- there were ads\nin the papers for -- that weren\u2019t o-o -- I mean, they were obvious to who wanted to\nknow, people that -- we at first didn't understand what this was about and if it -- it\nwould say, I don\u2019t know, apartment for rent, so and so, close to Protestant church or\nclose to such and such a place, or close -- you know, that kind of stuff.

They -- they -- they didn\u2019t\nunderstand really, who we were. I mean, we lived in very integrated society. And I -\n- there was recently at the museum a very nice guy from Israel who had -- he must\nhave had a very, very high position in Israel now because everybody was running\naround him like he was really somebody important. And he -- we found out that he\nhad been in Zagreb the -- this is another thing that has very little to do with me, but\nin a way maybe it\u2019s interesting. He came from a place called Gradisca originally,\nwhich is in the Burgenland, which is on the border of Slovenia and Austria. And it\nis populated mostly by people who were -- who came, I don\u2019t know in which\ncentury, probably in the 17\" or 18\" century from a very poor part of Croatia to this\narea. It\u2019s on the border, sort of Austria, Slovenia, Hungary.",
        "A: Okay. And they\u2019re always -- they kept their national costume and they kept their\nsongs and they used to go around all over the -- all over cro -- Yugoslavia and in\nother places to sing. These were well known minorities who, after I don\u2019t know how\nmany centuries still kept their language and everything else. So this gentleman from\nIsrael tells me that he originally came from there. His father had a factory in this\nBurgenland and he told me the name of the town, I think is Firestaat, I\u2019m not quite\nsure what it was. And he was a refugee with his family in Zagreb and they were\nvery Orthodox and he told me about -- they had a separate synagogue, they had the\nseparate -- it wasn\u2019t a synagogue, it was a separate place where they went to pray or\nthey had that -- I had no idea these people existed. I had absolutely no idea. In the\nJewish school where I went, my grade school was the Jewish school in Zagreb,\nthere were a few Sephardim, very few. And there were -- I suspect from the same\nfamily --",
        "A: The Sephardim were from Bosnia --",
        "A: -- originally, I\u2019m sure. I can\u2019t imagine any other place. But some Orthodox Jews,\nbecause I know that the boys were -- wore pants and I think they wore a hat, or a --\nor a -- or a [indecipherable] or whatever. They were very, very poor. These were\nfrom around Zagreb somewhere and they were dressed -- I will not say that they --\nthey weren't -- you know, they were wearing jackets, what kids would wear,\nlederhosen, God forbid. They would wear some jackets and so on and now when I\nlook at these pictures I see how they\u2019re really quite distinct. And apparently these\npeople had a -- had a -- not a synagogue, certainly a place where they gathered and\nso on. So this gentleman now from -- from -- who came from Israel was telling me\nabout that. By the way, the museum was fantastically helpful to him. They found\nsome books that -- about stuff that his father had told him originally, and he never\ncould check it out and he saw it, tears were going down his face, I mean, it was just\nunbelievable. But this gentleman told me that he had class and that they were very\nreligious, although not wearing any kind of garb, and that he -- he had the different\nrabbi. I mean, he didn't know about our rabbis, and so -- he was a child there and so\non. Now what I found out later about these peoples -- about this -- this place,\nGradisca, which now is Austria, 1s that they had parallel city governments, they had\na parallel Jewish and non-Jewish police, a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish fire\nbrigade and various other things like that. So during various holidays they would\nspell each other.",
        "A: So an -- I had no idea about that --",
        "A: -- he told me that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I also didn\u2019t even know that there were that many Jews there. I remember --",
        "A: -- you know, I can think of Croats and singing and folk costumes, but apparently\nthere was a very, very large Jewish community 1n that place.",
        "A: Strange.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: On the other hand, there was a very nice auth -- actually, I -- I did know, I mean,\nthis guy, this Polish person who -- who was a -- who -- who was a partner of my\nfather, they had come -- but I think they had come earlier.",
        "A: And they were not -- they were not Orthodox or anything like that. In fact, the\ndaughter married somebody, a very, very Conservative person, whose name I can\u2019t\nremember now, who I think is either at Harvard or Princeton who -- who you hear\nevery once in awhile, I -- I\u2019Il think of the name. But no, they -- yeah, then in New\nYork there was a wonderful pastry shop called Elite. Th -- I think it -- yeah, Elite.\nThe -- Elite was on 72\u2122 Street between, I think Broadway and whatever the next\nstreet was, and that\u2019s where everybody got together from various parts of -- these\nwere central Europeans, they were not eastern Europeans.",
        "A: They were Germans, Austrians, Yugoslavs, maybe Czechs. And that Austro-\nHungarian pastry was what was --",
        "A: -- trac -- was there, and I guess maybe the owners were there and large coffees\nwith heaps of whipped cream and so on. They have disappeared. And they all read,\nincluding my father and so on, was a -- an -- a newspaper called The Aufbau. Have\nyou heard about that? It\u2019s a very interesting -- 1t was a paper people were looking --\nfirst of all it was political, it was very interesting politically. And secondly you\nwould find ads. People looking and looking for so and so from such and such a\nplace, anybody know whether this person survived or not. This went on for years --",
        "A: -- years. And lots of very liberal editorials and so on. I don\u2019t know whether it\nstill exists, but it was called The Aufbau. And as I said, they all sat around waiting\nfor better times, yeah. I\u2019m not quite sure when we started hearing about -- about --\nreally. We knew about concentration camps, but we didn\u2019t know about killing\ncamps until fairly late.",
        "A: Later than we should.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And there weren\u2019t any, as a matter of fact. I mean, maybe there\nwere, but they were -- they were -- 1t was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Do you?",
        "A: One of my daughters doesn\u2019t want. Didn\u2019t want and doesn\u2019t.",
        "A: The other one has two.",
        "A: We first lived with my parents for a very short time. Then we moved one house\nfur -- one apartment building further on, 1n a studio on Riverside Drive. We were\nthere, I\u2019m not quite sure h-how long. My husband was trying to find a job, didn\u2019t\nfind a job, he -- my father was, I think, hoping that he would be maybe a\nbusinessman, which was the -- the -- the mo -- two times that he -- he tried, it was\ndisastrous, and he was very unhappy, and so that never -- one of them,\nunbelievably, was with a guy who -- who made Desenex, if you know what that 1s.",
        "A: Okay, you can imagine what fun that was. But at that time it was just beginning,\nthey\u2019re probably making millions now.",
        "A: Okay. That wasn\u2019t quite his thing. Then my uncle got involved -- do you\nremember L\u2019il Abner?",
        "A: Do you remember the shmoos? Shmoos were little fat things that would -- that\nwould swoon and fall on the st -- on -- on -- just to please you and you could eat\nthem, and that made them very happy, or whatever. So my uncle started -- I don\u2019t\nknow how he got -- I think he got connected with Al Capp somehow, and AI C --\nmy uncle who was a lawyer, who by that time had come from Cuba -- via Cuba,\nlet\u2019s put it. He started the shmoo business and they had little boxes with shmoos on\nit and a tiny little, you know, s -- s -- candy in the little boxes, and I don\u2019t know,\nyou know, these little rings, or little -- little charms, or whatever, were stuck in\nthere. And this went for awhile, and they didn\u2019t do very well, can you well -- you\ncan well imagine it. Then this fell apart and one of the people who had meanwhile\ncome from Yugoslavia, via I\u2019m not sure how, not easily, had come -- who -- who\nwas an extremely well-off person. If I tell you that he owned the salt monopoly in\nYugoslavia --",
        "A: -- and various other odds and ends like that. And he had two sons, one of them\nwas a year, maybe two -- no, two years older than me, who -- one time I think the\nfamilies may have thought we\u2019d get married, but neither he ever wanted to, or I -- I\nmean wa -- not even. And we were constantly having -- we were -- we were always\ntrying to outdo each other in one thing or another and th-this started when we were\nquite small and we were both riding, and we were supposed to -- to have a -- have a\n-- I don\u2019t know, a trial for a -- for a horse show. And, I think I was maybe 11 then\nand we had -- my mother was in Vienna at the time and I had gone with a man na --\nnot with a man, he was the governors by that time, to this place where -- where we -\n- we were supposed -- supposed to practice by jump -- not jumping, but various\nother odds and ends. And there was this very beautiful horse that was very\nunpleasant, very obstreperous and very -- not very good. And this -- he said he\nwouldn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t even thinking of riding this horse, and I was -- and I was\ngoing to do some up -- one-upsmanship, I said I would. And I did, and I had an\nabsolutely horrible fall, they thought I would have had broken everything, I had a --\nI had a problem. In -- in fact, I think I ha -- since that time I have problems with my\n-- not with memory, but with other things. It took -- nothing was broken. It was an\nunbelievable thing, but nothing did. And then this -- his father, the salt monopoly\nperson, who I think by that time had changed his religion, decided to -- to go to the\nsynagogue because it hadn\u2019t -- it was me and not his son who had gotten that fall.\nAnd -- and -- and what else did he do? Yeah, and he didn\u2019t eat on Saturday until\nnoon, or some other kind of thing like that. But we\u2019ve always been friends. So\nanyhow, this guy arrived with a lot of money and he eventually got a -- not a lot,\nwell, back some money. Not quite as well as we did, because he -- they were much,\nmuch better off than we were. In fact, their house in Zagreb now is the German\nembassy residence. No, Austrian, Austrian.",
        "A: Austrian. And the guy lives in New York and is 1n not very good shape. But\nanyhow, my father s -- decided this is such a wonderful businessman, that Morris,\nwho is such a miserable businessman, but does speak English and does have\nconnections and so on, and certainly knows the south, we went to Athens, Georgia,\nand they bought --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: -- his name was [indecipherable] and there were -- there were quotas that were\navailable for -- I think it was peanut oil, mostly peanut oil. There were great\nshortages in the States and these people had this oil at -- what you would call it?\nNot a factory, 1t was -- it was a plant. And then they would homogenize some and\nthen he would buy futures, you know, like -- like huge con -- railroad containers\nworth of stuff. And then if you were smart you made a lot of money, but they lost a\nlot of money. Drove my husband up the wall and my father was absolutely\nconvinced that this very smart businessman would do it and this very nice person\nwho could, you know, talk to other people, could do anything, fell apart. Morris felt\nawful. We lived in Atlanta for about a year and a half, I believe, at the time.",
        "A: I believe then we came back to New York and I became pregnant. Were -- we\nwere -- we lived in a -- a project -- my mother said it was a project, it\u2019s supposedly\nvery sheik, you know, it was a -- was something called Fresh Meadows, somewhere\nin a -- not too far, let\u2019s say, from LaGuardia airport, I would think that\n[indecipherable] and so on. And still he couldn\u2019t find a job and so on. And then we -\n- by that time my family in Venezuela said to Morris -- oh, and then there were\nseveral, again, suggestions, want you to change your name. And he refused to do\nthat and my -- up -- people at various places made this suggestion. Well meaning,\nyou know, nobody unpleasant. He said no, he wouldn\u2019t, his father had come with\nhis -- this name and, no. And he didn't want to find himself 1n a position where he\nwould, you know, not represent himself [indecipherable]",
        "A: He is -- he is so scrupulously honest it\u2019s unbelievable, my husband. I -- I -- I can\nsometimes tell a lie if 1t\u2019s necessary. Not a lie, but a, you know, a social lie, so -- but\nhe can\u2019t, he is straight arrow. And -- as, by the way, are both my daughters. I don\u2019t\nknow that I\u2019m devious, but under circumstances I guess I could tell a lic. You know,\nnot -- not -- not for everyday use --",
        "A: -- but I could. So then -- my cousins by that time were in Venezuela. They had\ncome via concentration camps in Italy, and for about a year or so. I don\u2019t know how\nlong they were in Spain and my father got them visas. They were going to go on\nfurther, I think, I\u2019m not quite sure where in South America, but they stayed there\nand they did very, very well, extremely well. And at the time the place was really\nstarting to move, and they asked my husband to come and see if there\u2019s anything he\nwould like to do there. He did and we -- I came over and then he -- the AP person\nwas kicked out because he wrote something about the -- the person who was the\ndictator then. And then they asked my husband to take his place, which he did and\nthen later he turned, he -- he was running a -- he and another guy, whose husband\nwas -- whose son was just recently with Bremer, asked for him and he was in -- in\n[indecipherable]. A very nice guy by the name of Horand. He and Morris then were\nrunning an English language page in one of the local papers.",
        "A: And then a -- he was doing, he was working for a fee and --",
        "A: It was in Caracas.",
        "A: By -- we -- I had gone with a baby.",
        "A: With a, I think, nine months old baby, with Jane. And my aunt was there and my\ncousin who is the nearest relative I now have, she\u2019s two and a half years younger\nthan I am, who had married a guy from Belgrade. A sephard -- Sephardi -- but,\noddly enough he was told by at -- it\u2019s a very interesting thing with -- his name is\nPinkas and when we -- when he got -- you know, when -- when his sons started --\nwent to the Jewish schooling -- where, by the way, my Jane also went for awhile,\nwas a very good school. He -- the director of the school said, listen, nobody called\nPinkas is as -- originally a Sephardi, how did this happen? So what probably\nhappened was that the mother was Sephardic and the father married into the family\nso all the --",
        "A: -- not all the ki -- all the -- all the customs and the food and everything was\nSephardic and he considered himself Sephardic. I mean, he had [indecipherable] I\nguess. But he also said that when he came from the concentration camp to Madrid --\nI think they came [indecipherable] to Madrid, that it was incredible. That it smelled\nlike in his mother\u2019s kitchen, that the food had the same names as in his mother\u2019s\nkitchen, that it all tasted like that, it was totally familiar. They did very well, and he\nis su -- they\u2019re very charitable, they\u2019ve given money left and right and he has now\npaid for the publication of an extremely interesting [indecipherable] now it\u2019s the\nsecond volume, a book -- a book called \u201cMismo Prezimali,\u201d \u201cWe Survived.\u201d And\nit\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a collection of stories of people from all over, from Croatia, from serv --\nSerbia, from everywhere, who survived various camps and so on.",

        "A: Yes. [reads Spanish] and so on.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He was working -- I\u2019m trying to think exactly how many years we were there,\nquite a few. By that time my mother had died. You know, I don\u2019t know exactly the\ndate, I wil -- forget. We were in New York when there was some -- oh, then what I\ndidn\u2019t say was that my husband then -- there w -- there was a weekly English\nlanguage paper, a weekly, called the \u201cCaracas Daily Journal,\u201d which he turned into\na daily. And it\u2019s not the paper th-that -- page that I told you the English page, that\nwas in a place called [indecipherable] I believe. And we were in New York and\nthere was -- on vacation visiting my father, to -- getting ready to go to New York, to\n-- to Europe, I believe, when there was some kind of business manipulation and he\nfound out that it wa -- he didn\u2019t want to stay there any more. They didn\u2019t really oust\nhim, but practically. There was a reason. I\u2019m f -- I\u2019m not quite sure how -- how it\nwent, but anyhow, he never went back. He didn\u2019t ba -- go back for various other\nreasons, and so on. And meanwhile, a very good friend of ours who had previously\nworked for Standard Oil of New Jersey, I believer it was, had been working -- I\nthink he was already in the Ford Foundation and he -- he asked him to join as a\ndirector for east we -- east -- for -- it wasn\u2019t east west [indecipherable] I\u2019m not quite\nsure how. They started at the -- the Institute of International Education, and he was\njust started and they started exchanges with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and\nthey were bringing in scholars and students and so on. And then he took a group of\nU.S. governors through a very extensive trip through the Soviet Union, and there\nwas a lot of, you know, brotherhood and such going on. And then he found that this\nreally bored him terribly because of the director of -- of -- of the Institute of\nInternational Education said Morris, why don\u2019t you present -- you know, do a paper\non that or give a suggestion on that and he would do it within 48 hours, and the man\nsaid you\u2019re supposed to take two months to do that. You -- you\u2019re making life very\nhard for the rest of us. And this went on and on and on like that til finally he -- he\nwasn\u2019t very happy about that. I mean, it was extremely interesting, but -- and by\nthat time students were coming in and graduate students mostly from -- from\nYugoslavia to Russian, so I was -- I thought it was interesting, but it wasn\u2019t fast\nenough for him. So meanwhile, a friend of his at the Associated Press said,\nwouldn\u2019t you please join our [indecipherable] services? [indecipherable] time and\nhe said yes. And then we were in New York til -- again, I can\u2019t tell you everything,\nwe were there for about two years, two and a half years. They -- and then he had all\nsorts of, you know, reporting trips all over the world, you know, mostly Latin\nAmerica. And after that -- let me quickly think how that would -- okay, they asked\nhim to go to Mexico as bureau chief. And again, don\u2019t ask me for dates. Where we\nwere on and off for, I think six or eight years, something like that.",
        "A: Yeah --",

        "A: I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t have been successful in any way [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. We arrived in Venezuela in 1950 because Morris couldn\u2019t find any kind\nof job in New York and I had family there that had just, a few years earlier re --\ngotten to Venezuela via camps in Italy, via Spain and then arrived there, I think\ntheir destination was somewhere else, but they stopped there and it seemed to have\nbeen a very good environment for them in every way. And Venezuela was really\nthriving at the time in spite of a very unpleasant dictatorship and -- okay. It -- it\nworked. And as I say, I -- I was some -- not some, but I was quite depressed. I di --\ndidn\u2019t speak Spanish. I helped myself with a little bit of Italian, but there we were\nand Morris then found a job with -- with Associated Press eventually, and we stayed\nin Venezuela until 1958. This was the time when I was teaching English in various\nplaces. It started out the suggestion of a friend of ours who worked for the U.S.\ngovernment, was at the embassy. At that time United States was setting up so called\nbi-national centers throughout Latin America [speaks foreign language here] this\n[indecipherable] that. And this particular one at the time was in downtown Caracas\nin an old, very beautiful colonial house, but obviously not meant for a school. There\nwas a huge patio with a lovely huge tree in which there was a sloth that would turn\nup every so often. And also a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 opened a barba -- opened a\nsteakhouse there. It was very nice, on one end of it. And the rest of it around this\npatio were classes. And I started giving classes to all Venezuelans of one kind or\nanother. Also Spaniards who came, who worked, it was very strange, you would\nhave -- for instance you would have Venezuelans who were -- who hardly had an\neducation at all who were very, very talented and learned the language very fast,\nwhereas you had Spaniards who were -- with -- with university degrees who were\nreally having problems in --",
        "A: -- with English.",
        "A: And this was going on for awhile among -- there were various American\ncompanies that sent their -- their -- their employees that needed to learn the\nlanguage --",
        "A: -- over to the center. So after awhile, a large hotel opened up, a -- belonging to\nan American company, I believe it was Pan American who owned it, but there was\na hotel called Tamana -- the hotel was called Tamana Cuentos, the large new hotel\nin Venezuela. So these people were coming from the site to this center, which was\nin the center of town. And then they decided that this was not good for them and\nthey offered me a contract to simply go to the hotel and sit there and ask the\nemployees, got enough time, they would come and get a class. So then I invented\nsome kind of very unscientific way of teaching them hotel English. Because you\nhad to teach a chambermaid something else than you would have to teach a -- I\ndon\u2019t know, a bellboy or something like that, or a waiter, etcetera.",
        "A: So I made up a lil -- little -- little classes and little phrasebooks for each one of\nthem and they would come, and was wonderful, in the middle of a patio with lovely\nflowers around and so on and they just wait for them. And we found, you know,\nthat if they needed to work, they worked, if they could come, they could come and I\nkept -- and I had a flat salary and it was really very nice doing it. This went on for\nquite awhile, I don\u2019t really remember exactly how -- for how long. And the rest of\nthe time I had a very nice time with -- my cousins were there, there was a large\nYugoslav community of one kind or another there. Mostly refugees, mostly Jews,\nbut not exclusive -- actually, not at all exclusively, there was a very successful\nDalmatian entrepreneur who was building bridges and who was importing cement\nand so on. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re still there, they\u2019re very successful still. He\u2019s in his\n80\u2019s, but he still travels back and forth to Yugoslavia [indecipherable] to Croatia,\nlet\u2019s say, probably -- I --I -- he is from southern Dalmatia, I\u2019m almost certain. And\nthen his sister came, an absolutely gorgeous woman. And --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: To a certain extent, not -- not 100 percent.",
        "A: I think they talked among each other quite a bit. This was a very heterogeneous\ngroup. I\u2019m just thinking, for instance, my -- my aunt\u2019s very closest relative was a\nwoman, a Serbian woman from Novi Sad, who lost her son, actually, who drowned\nin Lake Geneva when there were refugees there. And then her husband died very\nfast, so you know, she was absorbed into the community. Some of them had been in\nthe same camps in Italy. There -- there was only one woman that I know who had\nactually been to a very unpleasant, very -- I mean, in the actual killing camp in -- in\nGermany. No, I don\u2019t think so. I -- I think they talked. They didn\u2019t talk -- yeah, th-\nthey -- they -- they talked among each other the most of.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I didn\u2019t experience any of that, and I -- truly I -- I -- there was a guilt\nfeeling.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think they thought [indecipherable] may -- maybe to an extent,\nyou know, because my brother was killed, and he was a U.S. soldier, but I -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t think so.",

But I don\u2019t think I was ever embittered. I don\u2019t think\neven my -- my parents were. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people who were, I don\u2019t want to\nhear about these people any more, don\u2019t talk to me about it, I don\u2019t care. But I -- I --\nI -- I never had that feeling. I was always very much connected to it.",
        "A: Possibly because I wasn\u2019t there, possibly because there was -- you know,\nwhatever I remembered was very nice.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. People who sort of started trickling back.",
        "A: No, people -- well, some -- some went back, and jus -- 1n a very -- well, this was\n-- some very sad things happened. For instance, my -- not my -- my -- my cousin,\nMia Bauer Pinkas, she had the large family on her father\u2019s side, th-the Bauers. And\namong them was Hanitsa Bauer, who -- whose father was a -- not a member of the\ncommunist party, but very left leaning and -- and actually had all kinds of trouble\nwith -- he -- he had to be very careful about it. One member of that family, a\nnephew, this was a guy who was a communist who was actually in jail at the age of,\nI don\u2019t know, maybe 18 - 19, pre-war Yugoslavia and who was killed in -- 1t was a\nnational hero and was killed in -- in the jail. His name was [indecipherable]\nFriedman. So, okay, this was a left leaning family. Dr. Bauer and Anitsa, after being\nan -- in ital -- in an Italian camp went to London and spent the blitz in England.\nThey were the first ones to go back. Not with the government in exile, but with -- I\ndon\u2019t know, [indecipherable] was liberated and there was a government. I don\u2019t\nknow whether it was really a government, but yeah, it was, formed, he went back.\nHe was a -- he was a x-ray specialist, a radiologist. And he, I think he was\n[indecipherable] in uniform as a colonel to the Yugoslav army, Tito\u2019s army and so\non and he was on the on the [indecipherable] for awhile. And his daughter Anitsa\nalso went, I don\u2019t know what happened to the wife, I think -- I guess she must have\ngone, too. And after awhile they went to Zagreb. This was not a good thing. They\nwere, after awhile very disappointed that -- what was going on. I believe one of the\nsayings were -- were -- were you -- you were conveniently in London during the\nwar while we were in the mountains. And I think there may have even been some\nintimations of anti-Semitism, but I will not swear, I will not say that. They ended up\nby going to Israel.",
        "A: And then from Israel to Venezuela.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not immediately.",
        "A: Not immediately, but after awhile many did.",
        "A: And there had been a group already there of -- of real Zionists before -- you\nknow, before there was actually an Israel [indecipherable] during the mandate, there\nwas a -- a kibbutz of Jews from -- from Yugoslavia, from that -- maybe early 30\u2019s,\nmaybe --",
        "A: No, no, in Israel they went --",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: They -- that was one of the most horrible things that I re -- read now when I was\nworking in the museum, in the Holocaust Museum. There was an attempt [phone\nrings] during -- maybe in 1941 -- \u201940 -- \u201941 or 42 to bring a -- the group of Jewish\nchildren to Israel via Turkey -- via -- from hung -- yeah, via Hungary and to Turkey,\nand then from Turkey to Palestine. [tape break] I was talking about this group of\nJewish children that were being evacuated, supposedly, via Turkey --",
        "A: -- to Israel. And I saw, in the museum now, lists -- and I don\u2019t know how this\ncame, this was probably st -- came with all th -- all -- all the papers, all the -- all the\ndocuments that were photographed in -- I mean, not photographed, whatever you\ndo, copied in -- in Zagreb from -- from the archives.",
        "A: Endless lists of what these children have to bring along as clothing, and I mean,\nmost of them are -- were killed. But the list consisted of two pair of pajamas, gym\nclothes, shoes --that means special slippers for gym. For a little girl such and such,\nso many pair of socks, for little boys that many underwear. This was absolutely --\nyou know, and that they were changing them, they were not the same. And the\nterrible story about this is that one of the woman, who by the way is part of that\nBauer family. A woman -- a woman who was an entrepreneur by herself in Istanbul\nin the lumber business. I think she was a widow and she was -- she was in the\nlumber business in Istanbul. And one of the people who was supposed to come was\nher grandson, whose name was Fayja, I forget the surname. He\u2019s a boy of maybe\neight, 10, not sure how -- and -- and I saw him on the list, by the way. And -- and\nthe list kept changing, too, you know. I don\u2019t know whether these children have\nbeen -- since then some were -- been taken away, some -- th-there -- there was all\nkinds of [indecipherable] going on there. And finally this group arrived in Istanbul,\nand -- which was known by the way, Croatia society [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A boy son -- a boy ans --",
        "A: -- but it wasn\u2019t him. But what had happened, this boy died in Zagreb of an\ninfectious disease while these lists were, you know, still [indecipherable]. And the -\n- inserted into the group of I don\u2019t know, there had to be that many that were\npermitted to go, was a child from Hungary, who was told to say he was Fayja so\nand so.",
        "A: And you can imagine that grandmother who thought this child had been saved.\nAnd i -- it --",
        "A: She was totally frantic. By the way, there\u2019s a relative of this person in New York\nwho\u2019s a -- who came on a totally different -- who came with some kind of child\ntransport from France, and boy -- and -- and to some foster parents in New Jersey.\nAnd he 1s a very well-known scientist at NYU, and he\u2019s working on that famous\naccelerator in -- in -- in Geneva, or in -- on the -- on the border with France.",
        "A: And this was a --",
        "A: But not this transport, this was a totally different, this was a --",
        "A: I think this must have been \u201941 - \u201942.",
        "A: I only know of this one, there may have been others. I\u2019m -- there were various\nways of kids being pulled out, but this was an official group and this was going\nthrough -- through the -- I guess the Germans and the -- the Croatian authorities and\ntheir -- I\u2019m telling you, there was more paperwork on -- on -- on what they were\nallowed to bring with them, including gym clothes. This was very important. And --",
        "A: They made it to Israel.",
        "A: Yeah. From Istanbul. Amazingly, one person who actually I -- I don\u2019t -- he -- he\nis not rela -- related to them. There\u2019s a man here who was working at the Institute of\nPeace, who 1s married to this -- let\u2019s see, she\u2019s not a relative of mine, but she 1s --\nsh-sh-she is a -- a close relative of a -- of -- of my cousins, I mean, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s a --\nmy cousin -- they have the same grandmother, let\u2019s put it that way, or great-\ngrandmother, some -- anyhow, she -- she\u2019s a blood relative. She\u2019s not my blood\nrelative, she\u2019s a relative who went to -- who spent the war -- I know I -- probably in\nItaly. Her -- her mother was the sister of this guy, Browning that I told you who was\nthe -- the famous leftist and -- and -- and a national hero and -- in -- in -- in Croatia.\nThis m-ma -- this person whose name is Tuval, who was this professor and -- lately,\nbut he was at Harvard and he\u2019s also at -- at the university in Jerusalem and who\nworked here at the Institute of Peace, and this 1s -- is -- is a very wonderful scholar.\nHis father -- they -- they had emi -- immigrated very much earlier from Novi Sad.\nThey were well known Zionists and his father went to Israel. I think they lived --\nthey lived in Jerusalem. And he went through grade school and unive -- and then --\nand high school and university in -- in Israel or m -- and then came to the States and\nstudied and then went back. There\u2019s a big tragedy in that family, too, but I won\u2019t\ntell you about. He was working with a Jewish a -- Jewish agency, I believe, the\nfather. This person was w-working with a Jewish agency in Istanbul. And the Papal\nNuncio in Jerusalem was the wonderful pope, you know, the -- John the whatever,\nthe -- the -- the super pope. He was nice, wonderful pope was --",
        "A: Yeah, well by then already -- but he was Pope John.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Who helped out with -- wi-wi -- with all kinds of -- of immigration things and\nhelped out with the Germans and so on, was absolutely wonderful in every way.",
        "A: So, you know, th-ther -- there was stuff going on, there were undergrounds, there\nwere -- there were official ways, there -- and, you know, there\u2019s that -- this was the\ntime of the mandate, there was no Israel [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think so. He was very touched when he first came to Israel, when he\nvisited, he -- he actually felt at home. I -- I -- I did not.",
        "A: I did not.",
        "A: Yes, I -- you know, you are what you are.",
        "A: This -- this was never a re -- a religious community, but for instance, my\ndaughter Jane went to Jewish grade school in -- in Caracas.",
        "A: It was a very excellent school and ya -- she -- actually she learned to write\nHebrew and -- and -- and Spanish at the same time, because this was bilingual and\nthis -- 1t was span -- it was called -- what was it called? Escuela [indecipherable] my\nGod, how is this, how am I forgetting that? [speaks foreign language here] 1t was\ncalled. And one of her first teachers [indecipherable] was a -- brought from Israel\nand she was of Bosnian descent.",
        "A: Yeah. A very nice woman. The other one was, I guess, either Russian Jewish or\nPolish Jewish or whatever. It was a very, very good school, and it had the regular\ncurriculum of the Venezuelan government, you know, whatever the Ministry of\nEducation had, plus a Jewish curriculum. So, you know, there wa -- there was never\nany -- any doubt in any of that. All --",
        "A: I mean, you know, I was Jewish, I was Jewish. It was --",

        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t",
        "A: I mean, how could I when -- no. Also, when we got back to New York, about\nwhich we will speak later, my father insisted that Jane go to a Sunday school in\nNew York, a Jewish Sunday school. And num -- and -- and when we were in -- in\nMexico, I had -- Mary went off to a Jewish Sunday school. Not for long, but she did\ngo. And Jane did, and so on. But neither of them are religious in any way.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That was not a very religious family.",
        "A: Yeah. No, no. I mean, there were certain customs that were kept and that was it.",
        "A: I mean if -- it was like you had dark hair or light hair or whatever, it was part of\nyour -- your being and that was it. And that had a feeling, you know, that it didn\u2019t\nreally require any -- any -- any nurturing. I -- maybe that was a mistake, I mean,\nthey -- they\u2019re well aware of everything and then, in fact, Jane married a non-Jewish\nperson who then, at his own behest became a -- a -- converted to Judaism and 1n his\nsecond marria -- marriage, married another Jewish woman. I thought that was quite\ninteresting.",

        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: From the very beginning.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, we -- this -- this was very straightforward.",
        "A: And they were among people 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- who -- who talked about it one way or\nanother. I mean th-this was very fresh in my cousin\u2019s memory, for instance 1n -- in -\n- in Caracas. She was surrounded by people who had been in this camp and that\ncamp and it was -- it was daily conversations.",
        "A: And some of it was even fun.",
        "A: For instance, my cousin met her husband in -- in -- 1n -- actually, near\nDubrovnik, but they were -- they were all -- both sent to a camp in Albania and the\nromance developed then -- then, and then they were sent to a camp in -- in Italy and\nit continued. And when they finally -- this -- this is another thing that very few\npeople talk about and has -- has nothing to do with my families, but I do want to\ncome back to that. You know, they -- they -- they had their own social life and they\ntried to cook and so on together. There was memories that they talked about.",
        "A: They were concentration camps, but they were not -- they were not killing camps\nof any kind.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. Maybe detention is more that --",
        "A: Yeah. One of them I for -- one of them was in -- in -- under Italian -- this was\nobviously by -- at that time Albania was under Italian occupation, had been for\nsome time and they were brought from the Dalmatian coast to -- to Albania and I\ndon\u2019t know exactly how long they were there, but they -- they were then taken to --\nby the Italian army, or Italian authorities to another camp which was called ferra --\nFerramonti di Tarsia in -- I forget where -- where exactly in Italy it was. [tape\nbreak] Think we was talking about the groups and -- no, I don\u2019t remember. [tape\nbreak] -- went over that they -- they -- they came to Spain and from -- and Spain,\nthey sent this telegram to us and then my father was going around to find out who\nwould give them visas and affidavits and -- and obviously deposits at the consulates\nfor money and then that\u2019s how it -- how they got there, they\u2019re all doing very well\nnow.",
        "A: And they were -- Dr. Bauer actually was a Zionist, was an active Zionist. My\naunt\u2019s husband.",
        "A: My cousin Mia\u2019s husband.",
        "A: There -- there were some who were maybe more -- yeah. But on the other hand,\nmy cousin didn\u2019t go to Jewish school in Zagreb and I did. I did go to the Jewish\nschool where obviously you had the regular Yugoslav curriculum for -- for grade\nschool, it went from one to four. And -- plus Hebrew.",
        "A: And actu -- and Biblical history. And at that time already, there w -- and I\u2019m\ntalking in the early 30\u2019s -- late 20\u2019s, early 30\u2019s, there were, in Croatian, Zionist\nchildren\u2019s magazines with beautiful woodblocks in it. And I still remember the\nname of one of them -- an -- of the main one, it was ca-called [indecipherable]. And\nI think it -- they were monthlies. Had stories about children, about Israel. About\nPalestine, not about Israel, about Palestine. And there -- there were people who\nwere leaving. There was, in my class in grade school, the son of the big Zionist\nleader, whose name was Dr. Alexander Leite, who -- whose son was in my class\nand sadly the -- he died at the -- I think the age of nine, maybe even 10, from scarlet\nfever. And that was a horrible loss. And Dr. Leite then went and -- and -- and was\nvery, very active in -- in Israel. I think he -- I th -- I think he survived. Yeah, I think\nhe did. He went over there. And there was a younger daughter by the name of\nTamara who may still be alive in -- in Israel.",
        "A: Mm-hm?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, we did, but those that survived were mostly leftists and those were people\nwho would have been -- who would have been partisans.",
        "A: And come to power.",
        "A: And then somewhere, of course, I mean, as I said, Dr. Richard Bauer decided\nthis was not for him and he went --he went to Israel. I know a lot of people who\nfinally did. The person that I mentioned to you before, aga -- who -- who lives here\nnow, she was a little girl, her uncle -- and she -- she -- most of her -- the war she\nspent with her grandmother, she tried to go -- they tried to get visas to go to Israel\nand they could not get a visa and they could not get a visa. And finally they\nappealed the -- the -- the grandmother appealed to one of the politburo members\nwho had been in the same -- I don\u2019t know whether cell, but certainly in the same jail\nas her husband -- I mean as her -- as her son, Branimir. And there was no letter, but\nthey suddenly got a permission to leave for Israel.",
        "A: So.",
        "A: We are in --",
        "A: -- Venezuela. We\u2019re still in Venezuela.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. This -- this was sort of unexpected, we were supposed to be on vacation\nand then something happened with Morris\u2019s job, which I don\u2019t want to go into right\nnow, it just got to be complicated, and -- and -- and Jane developed the measles, I\nbelieve, or something and we could -- we were supposed to have gone to Europe\nand we did not. And so he started working for first -- the Institute for International\nEducation for east west exchange. But he found that 1t was going mu -- 1t was very\nslow. I mean, he was given a project that was a -- that he finished within, I don\u2019t\nknow, three, four days and this was supposed to take several weeks. And he just\ncouldn\u2019t stand it and then he quit. And meanwhile, at the same time, the Associated\nPress asked him to please come back and he did. There was -- he was on a night\nshift or on -- on -- on -- on an awful shift and at we -- that was pretty stressful I\nmust say. He hardly ever saw the children and so on. And -- but he had some very\ninteresting [indecipherable] etcetera. And we were there from \u201958 to \u201961. The\namusing thing was I, having gone to -- going to a private high school in Yugoslavia\npre-war, there must have been something wrong with you. This was, you know, you\n-- th-that was -- it was looked down upon in a very serious manner. And I remember\nmy poor brother who had been in England and had lost a year\u2019s worth of national\nhistory in the croa -- and the national language. He, in order not to lose a year in\nhigh school, went to a private school and it -- that was the most dramat -- I mean the\nmost horrible thing for him, he absolutely hated it, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So, you know, you went to a public school.",
        "A: And as we came -- as I said, as we Ca -- as -- as -- when we came to New York I\ninsisted that Jane go to a public school. And we bought this -- and what was\nsupposed to be a very good public school was P.S. six and P.S. six was in an\nextremely expensive neighborhood and the only wa-way she could have gone, we\nhad to buy acon -- no, not condo, what you call, the -- these other things.",
        "A: Co-op. And finally as we, you know, after a year we saw that she was way\nahead, and so she was taken out and she went to the United Nations school.",
        "A: Which was very good at that time. The amazing thing was, you know, she would\ngo there, changing buses twice with a friend. And there was, you know, she was\nabout 10. It was very nice, that wa -- that was good. The same time I ran into\nsomebody who had been a very intimate friend of mine for years of -- when we\nwere both at Voice of America, and her name was Mira Mihalofska and her\nhusband was the Polish U.N. ambassador there. We ran into -- into each other at the\ncocktail party. I had no idea that\u2019s where she was. And we\u2019d been in touch ever\nsince. So one of the boys was in Jane\u2019s class at the U.N. school, the ol-older one\nwas also at the U.N., but -- so that was good.",
        "A: Very nice.",
        "A: And also my father was there and there were -- and -- and an aunt of my\nmother\u2019s who was still alive, who had survived in the most horrifying manner. She\nwas in Italy with her husband, who was a -- she was born in Hungary and she was --\nshe grew up in Osiek, her mar -- her -- her mother married a second time, a\nwidower. And they were in something that was known as the con -- a confino\nlibero. Confino libero consisted of you were 1n a small town in Italy and you\nreported to the police, I guess once a w -- day that you were there. And they were\nstaying in a room or two rooms or whatever, in -- in Some pensionne or wherever\nthey were billeted. And that was it. And her husband apparently was -- had gotten\nsome gold pieces that he must have been counting, or somebody was aware of the\nfact that he had them, and they -- some -- th-this had nothing to do with the\nHolocaust or anything, these were plain old robbers, had killed him and hit her on\nthe head and buried them both. And she woke up when she came to and she was\nburied on top of her husband, and she crawled out.",
        "A: And saw the dead husband there. And there was a big -- do I have, and I\npromised the museum that I would get all of these newspaper clippings 1n Italian\nand give it to them. Things like beautiful Jewess, you know, resurrected from the\ngrave, so to speak. She wasn\u2019t beautiful at all, bu-but she was a younger person, so\nanyhow Italians were being very complimentary. And she stayed there and finally\nwas permitted to go to Switzerland where she worked as a maid. The Swiss were,\nyou know, the Swiss were the way they were. And they permitted her to stay there.\nAgain, she had to go, I think once a week or so or maybe even more often with a --\nwith a little I.D. with her picture on it to present herself to the police that she was\nthere and she worked as a maid, or cleaning woman, I\u2019m not quite sure what.",
        "A: And finally we were able to get her visa and she came to New York and she\nstayed with us for awhile.",
        "A: My mother. This was on my mother\u2019s side. Her name was Clara Frankel.",
        "A: My mother passed away yes, in her fi -- and we were still in Venezuela,\nsomewhere like \u201957 or so.",
        "A: Yup, but my father was fir -- he came to us and then he went wi -- he went on a\ntrip around the world. And of course he\u2019d been going back and forth to Yugoslavia\na great deal.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, he was seeing friends. He was working on -- on this restitution that we were\nsupposed to get and getting papers together and so on. I still keep finding bits and\npieces of paper that he was working on. And seeing friends. He would go on\nvacation in the north, on -- do you know where Opatiya 1s?",
        "A: Okay, to Opatija for weeks at a time. And seeing friends.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think -- have -- I went -- I truly -- I do -- I\u2019m trying to remember\nwhether I went with Morris and my uncle or whether I went with my father. I think\nI went with my father. Somewhere in the 50\u2019s.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Even less maybe, I\u2019m -- you know, probably 10 years.",
        "A: It was sad. It was sad but it was nice too, because I saw friends. I went so see the\nhouse in the country, which was -- which was a ruin then, which didn\u2019t, you know,\nwas a ruin, it was a ruin, I me -- I -- I started getting sad and nostalgic when they\nstarted rebuilding it, unnecessarily. But that -- 1t was -- it was just the way I had\nbeen sent photographs.",
        "A: I saw various friends, some who had gotten married. Male friends, boy friends,\nwhatever, people like that who I\u2019d been in correspondence with all the time, and --\nand a few girlfriends. Then -- and -- and my father st -- oddly enough, quite a few\npeople that he knew were still alive, he was seeing them and so on. And by that t-\ntime -- by that time I think quite a few of the -- whoever was Jewish had left, unless\nthat had been really very rabid leftists. My father\u2019s very intimate friend for years\npre-war was the Yugoslav or Croatian, whatever you want to call it, sculptor, Antun\nAugustin\u00e9ic. And they had been in contact pretty much the -- forever, and he was a\nvery close friend of Tito\u2019s and he was very high up in the government. And I think\nwhen they were -- Yugoslavia gave as a present to the United Nations this\nequestrian statue which is still standing there. When that was being put up my -- I\ndon\u2019t know whether Augustin\u00a2i\u00a2 stayed with -- I was not, I was in probably -- Iam\n-- 1am not sure where I was, probably in Caracas at the time. He saw my father and\nthen when the statue was actually brought, he also brought the st -- this statue which\nwas given to us, which was -- which 1s part of a -- one of those partisan monuments\nthat are all over Yugoslavia and which -- which stood in our garden in -- in Caracas\nand to which Mary referred to as la nifa boomboom, because she has a -- she has a -\n- a -- a gun in her hand, a -- a -- what is known as a [indecipherable] in Croatian, but\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s a submachine gun, as you can see.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The sad part of course was that you kept getting details of who did what to\nwhom, and that was very prevalent.",
        "A: And one of the strangest -- I don\u2019t know whether I told this story at all, maybe I\ndid, if it\u2019s -- came back and I started visiting people around the place and among oth\n-- and then, you know, Zagreb is a very small town and was a much smaller town\nand suddenly the word was aha, she\u2019s here. And people started inviting me back and\nforth. So one of the peop -- two people remain in my memory, that was first time I\nwent back. One was -- were the parents of a childhood friend of mine by the name\nof Zlatan Blinavich. Zlatan Blinavich I knew when he was 10 years -- when I was\n10 years old and he was 11 years old and we were sort of -- not childhood\nsweethearts, but anyhow, an interest. And we were -- the family was very Croatian\nnationalist, although I would have never thought of them as UstaSa by any means.\nThe mother, I believe, was Austrian, but I\u2019m not sure. Maybe German. Austrian, I\nbelieve. And he and I -- I mean, he went all to -- to, say the equivalent of my\nschool, the [indecipherable] gymnasia, which was in another part of town. But we\nplayed tennis together and we -- we were very close friends. That sort of -- held\nhands maybe, stuff like that. And he apparently collaborated like crazy. If not more\nthan collaborated and immediately after the war, took off for Argentina. And I had\nheard that. You heard all sorts of things because there was -- in particul -- I -- you\nknow, it was a very key generation. People who were between say 18 and 22 - 25\nwhen the war started. [coughs] Excuse me. So this lady heard that [indecipherable]\nand her husband that I was back and she asked me to come and visit her. It was a\nbig story about you know, he hasn\u2019t been -- he really never collaborated, he was\ncalled into the army and he was part of the -- he was -- he was not an UstaSa, he was\njust a foot soldier and so on. But that\u2019s not true because if he had been he would\nhave stayed and he went to Argentina and never came back. And I really don\u2019t\nknow why -- why they called me, but maybe -- you know, they knew me from\nchildhood on and I felt they probably wanted to -- they weren\u2019t -- were they\napologizing? Maybe. Maybe.",

        "A: -- maybe pleased to see that somebody had survived. And I never heard from\nhim, but I heard via others that he was in Argentina and died fairly young, as far as I\nknow. The other person I visited was the mother of a friend of mine who became a\ngreat -- he wasn\u2019t a friend of mine, he -- he was a friend of my brother\u2019s, he went to\nschool with my brother. Her -- his father was a -- one of the few psychiatrists in the\ncountry and he ran a psychiatric hospital near Zagreb and then after the war he was\naccused of some malfeasance by the communists and he committed suicide. That\nwas a horrible story. He was completely innocent, but they kept pushing and\npushing and finally -- and his son was a very, very prominent newspaperman in\nBelgrade later on. He\u2019s a friend of ours. And this lady heard that I was in Zagreb\nand insisted that I come and see her, which I did. And this -- this is a si -- this 1s one\nof those things that I never will get over with, how are you -- how are you, and you\nknow, about the son, who at that time was in Belgrade, married for the second time.\nAnd by the way, we were friends in Mexico, he -- he ba -- he ba [indecipherable]\nthe corresponding [indecipherable] in Mexico. The lady -- I-I walk in and she\u2019s oh,\nhow nice to see you, keeps looking at my clothes, and this, that and the other, and\nsays, you know, I remember exactly what you wore to the opera and tel -- to\nPacival. And describes this dress to me, I had completely forgotten. I mean, here her\nson had gone through partisanship, her husband was -- committed suicide because\nof -- because of pressures. Her life is nothing. By the way, one son is a very\nprominent physician somewhere in -- in -- I don\u2019t know, in the -- in the s -- you\nknow, the United States, in -- in the middle west, I believe. And she\u2019s describing\nmy -- the dress I wore, for Pete\u2019s sakes. You know, wha-what remain -- what goes\non in people\u2019s minds? I couldn\u2019t te -- I don\u2019t know, maybe this is some kind of a\ndefense mechanism because th -- fa -- you know, I remembered eventually, I mean,\nthis was -- as it was I hated all of this getting dressed and dressed up and so on, and\nI hated it.

And in fact there was a lot of stuff go -- you know, that --\nthere\u2019s -- there was a -- a state owned -- large estate where there were -- there --\nthere were -- I don\u2019t even know what -- or how I would go th -- I -- I think there\nwere -- an agricultural estate called Bainya, and they had [indecipherable] went\nthere for a hunting, and he did too, and he killed a bunch of things, and there were\nremarks about how this was brought there for him to be able to cab -- it\u2019s not true,\nhe was a good shot, and a good hunter, anyhow. But he went to this -- I saw this --\nto this bullfight in Mexico, and there was a very unusual incident where the bull\njumped and got caught, you know, where this -- this blind where the -- where --\nwhere -- where the bullfighter hides?",
        "A: It\u2019s like a wall.",

The men went fr -- went -- I don\u2019t know whether they went by\nplane or whether they went by a special [indecipherable] group, but she was\nattached up to Mrs. Tito. And they stopped halfway, I think maybe even overnight,\nI\u2019m not sure, in a town between Mexico and Acapulco. And, poor woman, not only\ndid this happen to her, but then they were presented by the governor of this state\nwith a beautiful carved box. And in the box was a very fine rebosa.

        "A: Okay. There\u2019s a great deal of Cu cu ru cu cu Paloma going on and Tito liked that\nvery well, and there were a lot of speeches and so on, so okay, we were all part of\nthis business, not because, you know, Lucie Rosenberg of Yugoslavia, but because\nof Morris Rosenberg, the [indecipherable]",

        "A: But maybe by that time no longer. But I -- we\u2019re -- who were you looking for?",
        "A: There was nobody on the horizon. You could get some very unpleasant Serb\nnationalists or very unpleasant Croatian nationalists. And were very few moderates\nthat you could even think about.",

And taking people shopping and all sorts of unpleasant things like that,\nit went on forever, and everything I don\u2019t want to have. I was happy when I could\nsit at home and have a meal to -- by myself with the kids, it was very, very\ndemanding. After awhile I got a little tired of all of that and I took an -- it -- I -- I --\nI took several courses. I too -- first I took a course at the -- at -- in anthropology, but\nwhat kind of anthropology? I did one with L\u00e9vi-Strauss who was doing stuff about\nthat time at the -- oh, what is it called, that -- they call it the [indecipherable] which\nwas you didn\u2019t get any kind of degrees or any kind of anything for it, but you sat\nthere and this was anthropology and what this was mostly on was -- was northwest\nCanadian Indians, and was wonderful, about the Inuits, and I had always been\ninterested in that. It was a super class, except in a -- when you think how classes are\ntaught nowadays and the way this was taught it was just incredible. Thank\n[indecipherable] was -- the building was, I don\u2019t know, probably 17\" century and\nnothing functioned at all. We started out by seeing nobody is permitted to use any\nkind of -- of recording device and someone actually went around to see what was\ngoing on. Then, as it was open and free, all sorts of hobos would come in and just\nsleep in the back there, because -- because you know, it was free, 1t was warm. And\nthen they had strange old windows that they always had problems getting the blinds\ndown and he had a assistant and they would do projections on the screen. And they\nwere invariably upside down. I mean, I don\u2019t know one time when this was straight.\nI mean, this is the leading anthropologist at that time, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and it w -\n- it w -- had a -- can\u2019t remember exactly how long the course started, who -- I was\nterribly interested in the material, I actually had Morris take me to -- to where --\nwhere this was take -- taking place. I mean, where these Indians were, and so on\nthat\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- Canadian me -- Canadian northwest was fairly fantastic. I was doing that.\nThen I took a course that was being given by an -- that was some kind of branch of -\n- | don\u2019t whether it was NYU, I\u2019m not quite sure -- that was given by the very\nfamous, and this is shameful on me, cultural anthropologist.",
        "A: It\u2019s American, I should know it.",
        "A: Shame on me. He did a wonderful thing on five Mexican families or maybe three\nMexican families at this point. I took that with a friend of mine. Then I decided to\ndo a class to teach -- to teach French. And this was mostly given by fre -- four\nFrench secondary school teachers from Les Colonie deut la mer. Colonies from\nacross th -- I mean, from the other side -- from across the oceans, let\u2019s say. And\nthey consisted fi -- of a number of high school teachers from Martinique, from very\n-- from African high schools and so on. And you know, their -- their curriculum is\nexactly, exactly the same in all of those countries as it is in France, and you can\ncount on it that on the same day the same thing, I -- I think it\u2019s still that way. The\nsame thing is being taught in -- in -- in Guadalupe, and who knows where in Africa,\nas it is in France. And the beginning of these classes when th -- st -- I mean the\nhistory classes, the history books start out by [indecipherable] our ancestors\n[indecipherable]. And I mean, you see these black ladies teaching this to these black\nchildren over there, it\u2019s quite funny. But it\u2019s a very rigorous program and -- and this\nwas taught as the special sk -- a special course for -- I guess maybe they got a little\nmore money for th -- from -- from the Ministry of Education, and they came for this\nspecialization in English.

        "A: I taught, but privately.",
        "A: Not -- not -- no. By that time the problem became that if you were not European,\nand the union just started, if you were English you could get permission to teach,\nbut not in -- in big schools. I mean, in actual classes.",

And people were\nbuying a -- these houses and renovating them, the apartments. There were some\nabsolutely wonderful, wonderful palaces there from early French history.

One of them was a family that Morris had met, a French\nfamily who had interests in north Africa and he knew them from Algiers, I believe.\nThey were very upper upper middle class. Nice people, that died since, both of\nthem. And -- I-I -- I\u2019m trying to think. Yes, my -- one of -- I found out that for\ninstance, our physician who we got by recommendation of somebody was -- I think\nhe was a Moroccan Jew.

And she was working -- this is another interesting thing -- she was\nworking for a manufacturer, clothing manufacturer who produced knock-offs of\nChanel clothes. And she would buy the ma-material and she would, you know, get\nthis kind of extra trimming on it and that kind of short or long or whatever it was.\nBeautiful stuff. This was then sent -- this -- they had lots of American buyers,\namong others, for Sachs Fifth Avenue, where the -- at that time the things were sold\nfor 700 - 900 bucks, stuff like that. And they were produced in one of -- were in --\nin where I saw the workshop in -- in the center of Paris, but not in a -- some kind of\nelegant district. How this was done was incredible. They would bring -- she would\ngo every once in awhile to Yugoslavia and she would recruit one or two tailors and\nthey would bring half the village along. Now this was -- they were all working, you\nknow, illegally, and every so often the f -- the -- the -- the French government\nwould -- would simply raid these places, and they would go -- they would go back.\nAnd then after awhile another village",
        "A: -- yeah. They were somewhere, they were actually like sweatshops, I think, they\nwere put up in -- and yet they were very anxious to come. This was beautiful stuff,\nyou know, silk lined with -- fantastically finished and so on. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine\nthat there were that many wonderful Serbian tailors, most of them were Serbs.\nWhole villages would come, and in connection with this there was a very funny --\nfunny, sad incident, what can I say? There were very many Roma at the time, many\nGypsies 1n -- in Paris, and they had an extremely bad reputation because what really\nhappened was a number of Yugoslav or other Gypsies la -- ended up in Rome or in\nItaly, and they -- they were trained by -- I gu -- guys who turned them into, you\nknow, pickpockets and this, that and the other. They lived at the end of the town\nand they really were pretty obvious everywhere, on every street. And wi -- the\nFrench police 1s not terribly kind so they, you know, everybody felt sorry for them\nuntil they were -- somebody stole something from them, lots of kids that were\npulling at your clothes and so on, and they was -- actually trained to do it. They\nwould be in Italy and that -- they -- obviously it was so easy to get somebody on a\ntrain, either from Yugoslavia or Italy or whatever and they\u2019d end up in -- in Paris\nand they were on the streets and they slept anywhere, you know, like that. And one\nday, very close to my house is this person, this Roma woman with a small child in\nher arms, and she hands me a piece of paper written on the letterhead of a convent\non the outskirts of Paris, saying so and so has been -- has a very sick husband, or\nhas been abandoned by -- by her -- by her husband and we beg of you, whoever sees\nthis to please help her and so on. This was -- you know, a little suspicious, anyhow,\nlooking, although the tone was right and the -- this was tha -- so I read this in\nFrench and she says the husband -- that she came, that she was a refugee from\nYugoslavia and so on. But I read that, I start talking Croatian to her, and she\npractically faints on the street. And I said, look, I\u2019m not going to give you any kind\nof money, I don\u2019t like the way this is going on, I mean, normally I would, but I\nreally felt badly about this whole thing. So -- as this was just across the street from\nmy house, I went and I got her clothes for her, I got masses of food, I -- you know,\nthank you, thank you very much, this 1s fine. So then two weeks later I get a call\nfrom my friend whose husband was, I think the ABC or CBS correspondent, guy by\nthe name of Bernard Redmont, who lived at another part of Paris, totally different.\nAnd h-he -- they -- you know, they were -- Redmont was in a very bad situation and\nactually had to leave the -- the States because he was implicated -- I don\u2019t know\nwhether implicated, but he was in those McCarthy trials --",

And then I\nwent, obviously through them -- through the permanent exhibit and everything else,\nand it was horrifying. I was also, at that time very much upset that there was hardly\nanything on Yugoslavia, very little. But then, it really isn\u2019t surprising because, you\nknow, how many Yugoslav Jews, or how many Yugoslavs really survived who\nwent through it, and there was very little left. Now, I did not mention that at the\nvery beginning, when -- when Yugoslav Jews started coming to New York er -- in\nthe 40\u2019s, they bought a plot in the -- in -- in -- in New Jersey where they formed a c1\n-- a cemetery, which is now quite full. And this apparently is very much what\nhappens, because there were groups from Germany, from Austria, from who knows,\nthe Bukovina and so on, who had plots of their own. And that\u2019s where it is, in New\nJersey, in fair -- fair -- Fairview mew -- New Jersey. And there was an association\nof Yugoslav Jews in the United States, which worked on A, helping people who --\nwho were totally, you know, bereft of everything and try -- got visas, worked with\nthe State department, worked with various other governments, helped with this\nrestitution business that I told you about.

        "A: \u201947, maybe? \u201946 - \u00b047 -- bringing refugees who were being given shelter in the\nUnited States and most of them were Yugoslavs. So I was sent by Voice of America\nwith some, as I said -- was about to say cameramen. There were some cameramen\nas a matter of fact, too, but mostly sound people. And we got there and this group of\npeople started coming out and they recognized me, a bunch of them, and they\nstarted asking about my brother, who -- so this was very shortly after the end of\nwar, maybe the war was still on. Yeah, the war was still -- and -- and I had to yell\nover, you know, hundreds of people to tell them there was no Mario any more. And\nthen another somebody came and so on. And they looked like absolute hell. These\nwere people who had been living in Italy and doing quite well. Had already, you\nknow, gotten things from the various Jewish organizations and had sort of pulled\nthemselves together, but here was the possibility of going to the United States, so\nwow, great. And it was great, in the end. But they came and they were not allowed -\n- we were behind -- we had barricades, this was yelling through barricades. First\nthing that happened when they arrived, they made -- before they arrived, they made\nthem give all the clothes, which these people had bought with whatever was left\nover, let\u2019s, you know, do a bella figura when you arrive here. And they were thrown\ninto 1 -- 1 -- it\u2019s -- 1-1t to be a -- deloused and [indecipherable]. So you got rags.\nEverything lost its color. They sprayed them with DDT, all these people, I don\u2019t\nknow whether it -- probably DDT, it was awful, they were delousing them and so\non. So these were people who had been living a more or less normal life in Italy,\nwho suddenly came. So then it was this big committee, they took them to Oswego\ninto an ex-army camp and put them behind wires -- I mean, behind -- behind -- I\nthink there was even, if I\u2019m not mistaken a -- a -- you know, wire. And was a big\nscandal. And I remember my father, who at that time I think was the vice-president\nor whatever, secretary of this association of Yugoslav Jews that were going there to\ntry to calm these people down, who were ju -- a great many were Yugoslav Jews,\nnot all, but a great many as this -- you know, they -- they picked them up 1n Italy,\nthese -- these people had already been saved, I mean, you know. They were in no\ndanger. And so first, you know, this -- this was a whole [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t\nknow exactly how -- well, they fe -- 1t got to be where the point where Mrs.\nRoosevelt went there to intervene and one day one of these people turned\nthemselves up -- turned up at our door, one of the women who knew where I was,\nabout maybe two or three years younger than I am. Friend of my brothers. Suddenly\nshe was at our front door in New York on Riverside Drive, and she spent the night\nwe -- my father and sister, she had to go back because otherwise she would have\nbeen, I don\u2019t know, I guess a criminal or whatever.",
        "A: And finally with -- I don\u2019t know exactly how long they stayed there -- but there\nwas a film about them, about this ship coming over. Maybe Ruth Grube or someone\nlike that worked on it and they -- as I said quo -- many many of -- there -- there\u2019s\nsome of them still here, one of them 1s a woman who lives in -- in Baltimore, who --\nwho was a -- a child then, a little girl and so on.

It -- it was a --\nyou know, it was a paternalistic st -- society altogether, and I felt strange echoes of\nthis much later. I came, for instance, to Belgrade and we saw Morris\u2019s secretary,\nwho was an old lady, and who recently died -- I think she may have been a hun --\njust under a hundred. She was the oldest person born in Belgrade who died. So she\nwas probably 98 or so. She had been evacuated during World War I, to England. So\nanyhow, he go -- he -- Morris, when they opened this reading room there, this lady\nVera Wynik was one of the secretaries and they -- she had a terrible time because of\nthe communists wanted -- were -- were threatening her in a horrible way. They --\nthey wanted whatever secrets, there were no secrets, but they wanted all kinds of\ninformation, which she refused to give. And they were harassing her to an awful --\nin an awful way, and Morris -- Morris felt -- heard about it later, and he didn\u2019t\nknow, I mean, she was about to commit suicide, and it\u2019s a very sad story. So he was\nvery close to her and he -- he was constantly in touch here and we -- she gave me\nsome of those icons that were there, and -- so, a wonderful woman, whom we\nvisited in Belgrade all -- the first time we went back. And she said to me, do -- I-I\u2019m\ngoing back to the paternalistic societies that were going on then -- she said to me,\nyou know, when your father came to visit me, he -- because my father went back to\nYugoslavia way before we did and Morris said, would you please visit Vera Wynik,\ngiver her my love, see what she needs and so on.

What have you got with Manfred\nSternberg? And apparently she said, he is the broth -- he is the -- the father-in-law\nof an old friend of ours and so on, who was so and so. They knew anyhow. And this\nke -- person kept insisting and insisting and insisting, a very high up person in the --\nin -- in the Secret Service, the OZNA, which was the scary thing, I mean that was\nthe secret police in spades. Turns out that this was a boy who my father had given\nscholarships to. He was -- I knew nothing about this, absolutely nothing.

        "A: Very, very tense times. You could tell that Yugoslavia was falling apart, and this\nwas very evident on that desk, I mean, they were in each other\u2019s hair in the most\nawful way. Although the head of, I guess what\u2019s known as the Yugoslav desk, is a\nwoman by the name of Mya, I forget the surname now, who was a Croat. And she\nstill is. But obviously with an American citizenship [indecipherable] and so on. So -",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I received one of the bulletins and I saw that they had a grant for a year for\na young man -- a young scholar, Canadian scholar who had just come -- who -- who\nwas just doing translations and make -- no, not doing translations, sorting and\narranging and trying to get under this huge material that they had gotten from\nZagreb, from the archives of Zagreb, and this -- I don\u2019t know exactly how this\nworked, but they had sent over somebody who -- who had microfilmed or whatever\nall of this material which was then there and it was there and nobody did anything\nwith it. I don\u2019t know how long this had been going on. And this young man was in\nthe process of publishing a book on the Croatian peasant party, which he eventually\ndid in English, and was very good. I think it was very good. And who then went\nback for the museum, I [indecipherable] but I\u2019m no -- yeah, I guess for the museum\nto partly -- to Zagreb, three years ago [indecipherable] three years ago.",
        "A: And was trying to get more stuff and so on from the archives. I -- this is a\nscholar and he really doesn\u2019t know how to push and penetrate. And when he came\nback to Zagreb the second time they suddenly, the -- the -- the [indecipherable]\nwhoever was in charge of -- of -- of permitting you to have paper, to have -- to\nmicrowave, or -- not microwave, I mean --",
        "A: -- microfilm, or -- or make copies or -- of any kind of m-material that you found,\nonly permitted them, I don\u2019t know, like eight a day or something crazy like that.\nAnd he 1s a ver -- not shy, but he is a retiring young man, and he didn't know how to\nsay listen, I am doing so and so, this is the book I have written now, and so on, I\nwant this. He just didn\u2019t do it. And I met him on a couple of occasions, I think there\nwere other distractions there, but I don\u2019t know what they were. And he -- he didn\u2019t\nfinish everything that needed to be done there, I don\u2019t think, for his --",
        "A: -- for hi -- for -- for -- for -- not for the museum, but for his own sake. And he\nhad met both Goldsteins, and Ivo Goldstein is also a historian and he told them,\nlisten, you just simply have to go there and -- and push and say and get in touch\nwith so and so. He didn't do it. He is working for the Canadian government now and\ntrying to get another academic job and I hope he gets it. This is a nice young man\nbut -- but -- but not sufficiently, let\u2019s say aggressive in that way. Also, he asked me\nseveral times did I know Dr. Mirjana Gross. A-And Mirjana Gross is my friend\nFaya\u2019s childhood friend. I didn\u2019t know her, but I knew who she was. She 1s the\nprofessor of history and I think mostly 18\" and 19\" cr -- century Croatian history.\nSo exactly the -- the -- the -- that era that he was writing on and so on, and a great\nexpert on the Croatian peasant party and so on. And I got them together and I\npractically -- and Mirjana Gross had to pull it out of him, she wanted a book, both\nfor the -- for the department -- or for the -- for the library, and for herself. I mean,\nhe had been asking me for -- and he kept, you know, oh, I don\u2019t know, do I have\nenough, [indecipherable] you know, and sh -- did -- he did. And then she said, well\nI hope you\u2019re going to 1n1 -- to initiate it -- yeah, to -- to initial it for me and he did,\nfinally. He\u2019s just not aggressive enough, but he\u2019s a good scholar. He says he\u2019s an\nexcellent scholar of Croatian stuff.",
        "A: Anyhow, I saw that he was here and that the stuff was there and I called him\nbecause I saw he was Canadian and I had my doubts about cron -- Canadian\nCroatian scholars, I didn\u2019t know what this was.",
        "A: Ah, wait a minute. This 1s -- really should be [indecipherable], Ill get it in a\nsecond.",
        "A: Can you -- can you -- [tape break] his book here.",
        "A: His name was Mark Biondich. He\u2019s a very talented young man and did really\nexcellent scholarly work on the -- on -- on this particular part of Croatian history.\nAnd he was a scholar in residence for a year there, and -- although this -- this really\nwasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t his -- his -- his -- let\u2019s say his branch of -- he knew very little about\nJewish history. He knew a lot about -- about what the UstaSa did and so on, that he\nwas well informed.",
        "A: But on the other hand, he couldn\u2019t put a face to any of that.",
        "A: And he and I together went through these documents, through these microfiches\nand ran into absolutely the most unbelievable stuff. I mean the -- whole classes of\npeople I knew and friends and schoolmates of my brother\u2019s. And people -- I mean,\nthe most unbelievable things. This was done mostly alphabetically.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Were killed. And in connection with this, for instance, later on, we --\n[indecipherable] who was working on the project kept getting these -- these requests\nfrom people to see whether they knew what happened to their brothers, to their\nparents and so on. And we got a request from a woman in California looking for her\nfather and her uncles and so on. And we immediately found the various uncles and\nso on. And then we found her name listed as perished at the [indecipherable] place,\nwhich we sent her.",
        "A: [indecipherable] person. And she had been -- she had come to Austria, sh -- her\nmother had smuggled her out with the help of a German officer and so on.

        "A: Yes, it was, yes it was.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was extremely -- I really, I tell you, honored is not quite the word to say, but I\nfelt it was -- I could contribute some way. I mean, there are not that many Serbo --\nSerbo-Croat speakers in -- in -- who have the time to do it in -- in Washington. So I\nwas extremely happy. And of course, the material had just arrived. I mean, this --\nnot just arrived, just been sorted out up to a certain point.",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- extremely so. There were a number of things that I didn\u2019t know about. I also\nfound, through some of the recordings, which I don\u2019t know who paid for, I believe\nthe museum must have paid for it -- for this. There were some eyewitness stories\nand so on done by a guy who lives in London who\u2019s a Sephardic Jew. And I can\u2019t\nremember his name right now, but he did it for the museum. And he told the story\nof a young man who was my boyfriend, so to speak. I mean, he -- he wasn\u2019t, but he\nwas, Okay [indecipherable] a very nice young man who was a law student, who\nperished in the most incredible, dreadful, complicated way that one can only\nimagine. He was a law student, he had been in the Yugoslav army, yo- you know,\nyou had to do your year. Sometimes it was postponed by a year if you happened to\nbe a student, but no, in fact, when we left he had just finished his one year, he --\nswaggering around in a very elegant uniform, with boots and so on. Very, very\ngood looking. And -- although, I really wa -- you know, he was decorative, I wasn\u2019t\nin love or anything like that, but maybe he was, I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\nbut you know, he -- we went out a few -- we went out, you know, f -- we went out\nfrom here to there together. It\u2019s the going out that was going on and -- and he\naccompanied me under the guidance of everybody else to balls and there\u2019s a thing\nwhen you were 18. Until you were 18 you didn\u2019t count as a human being. And\nwhen you were 18 you went to the journalists ball, and then you were launched.\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: -- it\u2019s a parade, oh, I hated that. Absolutely hated it. But anyhow, he -- this\nyoung man was a law student, just finishing, I guess, not even that. And he was\ncaught with the first group of people, the first group of young Jewish -- and then I\nguess whatever pro [indecipherable] boys who were there, but mostly Jewish, I\nbelieve. And they were taken to a -- to two camps. But anyhow, he was -- finally he\nended up in a camp in the Velebit mountains. And he came -- and this was told to\nsomebody who was -- who wa -- who was there, he -- this is told by a guy who --",
        "A: -- saw it. Who, by the way was a big -- became a career Yugoslav officer, he was\na colonel. And he was a sports person in Zagreb, I think he was a skiing champion\nor whatever, something like that. So, this group was taken to this camp. And as he\nhad just pre -- previously been in the Yugoslav army, he knew that area and he was\ntelling these guys, oh I know where this is, this is not bad, lik -- we\u2019 ll -- we\u2019ll --\nwe'll try and get, you know, get together and all of these things, and maybe it will\nwork out and so on. And as he was taken to this prison, a fr -- somebody from the\nsame year of law school, not a friend but somebody he knew, who became a UstaSa\nofficer, I believe, or maybe n -- anyhow, he was there and saw him. And being a\nnice person, he wrote his parents say -- saying I saw Dragon today at such and such\na place. He didn\u2019t say he\u2019s alive, but that was obvious. They were a fairly prominent\nfamily and -- and the parents took a postcard and wrote him a postcard saying,\nwe're in Zagreb, hope you\u2019re okay, that\u2019s it. The commander of the camp saw this,\nthis was intercepted and brought to the commander of the camp, the UstaSa, who\nsaid, how come your parents know where you are? This guy had absolutely --",
        "A: -- I mean this had been -- this had been intercepted. He never got the card from\nthe parents. He said, what are you talking about? He says, you told your parents,\nyou wrote your parents to say where you were. He said, no I did not\n[indecipherable]. And -- and -- and he executed him right there on the spot, he cut\nhis head off. I mean, this guy knows, who told this story. This kind of material I\nwas running into.",
        "A: I mean, this -- this is somebody with -- I was photographed with, you know,\nstanding behind me and I guess doing waltzes and stuff.",
        "A: It -- it was just, you know. And some of it -- y -- all of it was pretty devastating,\nbut when this was some -- and the horrible part about this guy was that he begged\nmy father the way we -- the day before we left, why don\u2019t you take [indecipherable]\nwe all going to get messed up, you are bu -- you know who you are, you -- you --\nyou know, you -- I can\u2019t.

        "A: And not even vaguely. Not even vaguely. We knew that people were starving,\nbut we didn\u2019t know to what extent this went. We knew that people were rounded\nup. One of the touching stories that -- that came from the museum was a woman\nfrom a village --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: This woman tells the story. She was -- I don\u2019t know whether she was -- she --\nshe mu -- she was probably a peasant. She says, we were standing there, and women\n-- and then later I think she wa -- she says Jewish women, but I don\u2019t think she --\nthis was her first thought. This must have been what [indecipherable] I mean\nsuggested to her, maybe. She said these women were coming in and they were\nobviously from town because they were walking with their pocket -- they had\npocketbooks. They had never s -- you know, this was not common in\n[indecipherable] where you had things in pockets, hidden pockets, or in -- in\nbandanas or whatever, like that. But she said these were women from town and they\nwere -- they were dressed with hats and -- and some had -- this came up later in the\nstory, they -- some came with -- with children in -- in prams, you know, in -- what\ndo you call those, strollers? No, they didn\u2019t have strollers, but whatever. They wer -\n- had babies in th -- in baby carriages. And -- and dressed with hats, maybe even\ngloves, who knows? It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: This -- this is how she identified these were people from town.",

And he -- he\nwas part of it and he was absolutely a miserable businessman and my father tried to\nteach him what business was and so on. And he had a particular significance for me\nbecause I\u2019d known him from, you know, childhood on. That point I was maybe 15\nand came in and we shook hands and he kissed my hand and I knew I\u2019d grown up. I\n-- | -- maybe I had just come back from England, maybe I was 16. Boy, I really had\nit. And I thought he was a bachelor the rest -- for all my life, I was very -- we were\nclose, I mean, Father was with him all the time. Not all the time, but often. When\nI\u2019m here at a Slovistics conference, sitting and listening to something, and I had my\ntooth pulled just a couple of days earlier and I was still under all kinds of -- had\nbeen taking all kinds of -- of -- of -- of painkillers and I thought I wasn\u2019t in my right\nmind. I come to this one room and presenting is a Slovistics professor called Joseph\nBombale. So I said, have I gone out of my mind? This was a bachelor when I left.\nHe was -- he was killed in Jasenovac also, by the way. And rightly so. And I went\nto him, I said, what\u2019s going on? And I said, is your aunt so and so? Countess Nun-\nNundine? Married a swi -- a -- a Dutch what would you call it, a dut -- a Dutch\ndiplomat. He said yes. I said, is your aunt so and so, Josephine? He said yes. I said,\nmy God, I thought Joseph Bombale was a bachelor. And he said, that does not mean\nanything. And then I talked some more to him. He knew exactly where, what and so\non.",
        "A: And there\u2019s a very nice picture of the place where they lived, it was the most\nbeautiful park in all of Croatia, is a nav -- a natura -- a park with fantastic things\nthat had been done by his -- planted by his grandfather, great grandfather, and so --\nso anyhow, this man, first of all he was taken to jail because he was a Freemason,\nand he was killed. But also, I think, in fact I\u2019m sure, he was being extra smart and\nthe UstaSa were smarter. He had been a hunting companion of Count Charno, who\nwas Mussolini\u2019s brother-in-law. And -- which my father knew, that they\u2019d been\nthere. But what my father didn\u2019t know is that they had sort of worked it out that --\nand in fact this went on for a little while, that some Italian prince was going to be\ndeclared the king of Croatia -- and this went on for a very short while and then this\nwas somehow eliminated. I would have to look it up exactly how to say -- how it\nworked out. And this good friend of ours was playing two sides.",
