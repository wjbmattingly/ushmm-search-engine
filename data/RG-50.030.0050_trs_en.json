        "A: I was born in Romania, near the city of Bac_u, uh June 25th, 1925.",
        "Q: Tell me about your family--about your parents, first.",
        "A: Yah. My parents uh...uh lived in Bac_u. My mother was not originally from Bac_u, [but]\nfrom another smaller city. But when she got married, she moved to Bac_u with my father.\nThey had a grocery. And my mother used to help my father. They were working together.\nUh, my father was a--how to say? A very special person. Uh, not because I am his daughter;\nbut uh everybody used to say the same thing. He was a very good and uh kind, and very...\nUh, a man who helped everybody, whenever everyone needed something, you know. He\ncould...you could wake him up at midnight or 2 o'clock in the morning. And uh if he was\ncalled to help somebody, or to...to bring something to somebody, or you know to call a\ndoctor or something; he would do anything for everybody and anybody. He was really a very\ngood-at-heart uh man. And he suffered a lot during his lifetime, because he fought in the...the\nFirst War...World War...World War (laughter) First... Okay. And he was just on the first uh\nline of the battlefield. He was decorated uh on the battlefield, you know; and he was\nwounded at a certain moment. And um...he was taken uh prisoner, as a prisoner. Yah. And\nwhen uh...well, when the [First] World War was over, he came back to Bac_u, his native\ncity. Uh... uh, they were uh a big family. They were 10 children--uh, two girls and eight\nbrothers. Uh, well, my father had a stepmother; because uh the first wife of my grandfather\nuh passed away. So my grandfather remarried, so they had more children. So...but she was a\nvery good mother for my husb...for my father, too. Excuse me. Uh, and they lived all in the\nsame city, you know. Now, most of them are now in Israel. They emigrated during the years.\nAnd um...he was very close to...to his family, to his brothers and sisters. And um...when the\nSecond World War broke out, you know, uh we were already in...we moved to Bucharest in\n'38. [In] 1938, we moved to Bucharest. Uh, my father has been very sick, very ill; and uh he\nlost everything--his shop, everything. So we moved to...to Bucharest. And um...he got a job,\na very small job, over there; because he was very sick before. And um...we went to school.\nMy sister--I have an older sister, two years older than myself. Excuse me--than myself. And\num...then when, you know, the Fascists came to power and the...all the Jewish students and\nyoungster were uh thrown out from all the schools, all grades of the schools, uh we went to\nthis Jewish schools. And um...that were organized uh...then, at that time. Because uh the\nyoung people, they had...there were this dreadful measures against Jewish people and Jewish\nstudents. They had to go uh...in uh to...to the labor...labor camps, most of the youngster. And\num...they weren't allowed to...to be in the state school anymore. So a whole system of school\nhad to be organized and put up, in order to fit in all these Jewish students and pupils--from\nkindergarten to elementary schools to high school and colleges. And um...the Jewish\ncommunity, uh they...uh had the very bright uh leaders. And um...they organized all this, all\nthis...the system of schools for everybody. Every student and child. And they printed books,\nschoolbooks. They printed university courses. And um...they uh...organized this...this\nclasses. So we went to this uh Jewish... I went to Jewish high school; and my sister, and\neverybody. It was very hard at the beginning. Because they were not... You know, it was the\nbeginning of this uh schools. And they had teachers, Jewish teachers; because the Jewish\nteachers were not allowed to...to teach in the state schools. Uh, very high level teachers. And\num...but they had to rent, you know, apartments or rooms for the schools, you know. Uh,\nthey organized the schools in some old synagogues or old Jewish schools, or just rented\nsome other uh...uh apartments for the schools. So it was quite uh hard to adjust. But the\nteachers were so good. And everybody was so willing to...to learn, you know, and to...to be\nat the same level with the other students. And besides, uh the synagogues uh played a big\nrole in uh keeping the uh Jewish tradition and culture and spirit, you know. So they\norganized all kinds of uh meetings and festivals. And um... Not just religious, uh from the\npoint of view of religion; but culture in the same times. You know, tradition. And uh they\nhad uh...you know, uh chorus--a music uh chorus, with students. And um...it was a place\nwhere we met, you know, and were able to discuss all our...all our, you know,\ndisappointments and sufferings. And um...uh then they organized uh this uh...some\nprofessional schools and courses. Because uh they said, \"Well, if not all the students will be\nable to attend the schools, at least they should have a profession later on.\" So they organized\nall kind of professional uh courses. And um...you know, technical, electrical--like to be a\ntailor, or to be a carpenter, or to be a shoemaker. And I went to a course of uh bookbinding. I\ntook a course of [this], because I like to read, (laughing) you know, and being related more to\nthis. So I...1 went to take this course. And besides they organized the clinic. How to say,\npolyclinic--health center-- for the Jewish people. Because uh they couldn't go to be treated\nanymore to the state uh health centers. So they organized. And uh, you know, the best\ndoctors and surgeons were treat...treating these people, sick people--Jewish sick people. And\nin the same time, they organized the...around this health center, uh medical courses for\nmedical students. So they were able to attend these courses. (Sigh)",
        "Q: Tell me what...what your parents were doing during this time. And what was your daily life\nlike as a family?",
        "A: Yah. Well, as I said, we...we went to all the holidays, to the synagogue, to all the festivals.\nUm, they tried, you know, to...to make the best of the life that was, you know, going on that\ntime. And um...they had a lot of frustration, of course. You know, because uh...uh they felt\nlike pariah, you know, among other people. You know, everybody feeled... felt the same.\nAnd um...we tried to be as much as possible together with our friends and family, of course.\nAnd um...you know, not to...to suffer of spiritually too much, you know. And um...they tried\nto...to help us, you know, with, you know, what we needed to have; everything we needed,\nyou know, our parents. So they didn't have too many meals at that time, you know, in this\nperiod of time. Because they lost almost everything. And besides, because my father had\na...a Store, you know, uh they were obliged to give to the state and to the army uh clothes and\nfood. You know, I remember. I was, you know, still quite young. Uh, my parents had to buy;\nyou know, they...they loaded two big couches...coaches...carriages, coaches, with, you know,\nclothes--all kinds of clothes and boots and winter coats--and food and everything. Uh, you\nknow, they [NB: the Romanian government] said that uh due to the fact that they [NB: her\nparents] had a...a grocery--they had a shop, you know--they must have been very uh...at least\nrich or something like this. So they had to...to give a lot of things. Really, they had to buy\nnew things, just new things. Not, you know, old things--clothes, or... So then, you know,\nlinen for beds and pillows and um...comforters and um...all kinds of things, you know.\nBecause they were sent uh on the battlefields, for the army on the front. Anyway. So it was\nuh really hard for them. Really hard for them. But they had to do it. They were obliged, you\nknow, to do this. And um besides, uh all the Jews were obliged, you know, to clean the\nstreets from the snow. To, you know, to uh do all kinds of uh \"city work,\" how to say, you\nknow. But especially the Jews were put to clean the streets and the snow; and to...to keep\nclean everything, you know, in the city. Which was, you know, hard for older people like\nmy...my parents. Nothing for younger people; but it was harder for older people to do things\nlike this. And besides, you were always afraid that somebody will knock at your door. And,\nyou know, there were so many people arrested, you know, for no reason. And uh you always\nlived in a kind of terror, you know; scared that somebody will... When you heard the uh bell\nringing, you were scared who...who could be. You know, you were afraid somebody would\ncome and take your father, take your mother, arrest you. And um...this was the way of life,\nthen. And um...as I said, uh they put up this uh very good schools and colleges and\nuniversities. Were uh brilliant teachers, you know. They organized even a uh...uh, how to\nsay, uh medical uh...uh college of medicine...college of medicine. Was a brilliant teachers.\nVery well known teachers.

And um...such a scare period of time, scareful period of time,\nfor everybody. And then, you know, they...the other, the Antonescu government, you know,\nhe took the power. So things changed, in a way, a little bit. You know, not they ...1t was\nbetter for the Jews. But uh anyway uh they were no more killing after the...the Legionnaires,\nyou know, uh uh were no more in power. But it was another hard period for...for the Jewish\npeople with even under Antonescu, until '44; because they were again...against the Jewish\npeople, you know. There were all these deportations, and um...all the...the uh measures\nagainst the Jewish people, you know. The Jewish population in general.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about the deportations? What did you see?",

And from\nBessarabia, and from the part of uh...the border with Hungaria [NB: Hungary], uh many,\nmany Jewish people were deported. From Bucharest itself, not too many were deported. I\ndon't know how we escaped in this way, you know. We didn't escape the bombardments, for\ninstance. In '44, when the American came...before the Russian came to liberate Romania,\nuh...the Americans started to bombard the railroads. And there's a city where--uh uh Ploie_ ti,\nwhere is uh the oil, you know-- because they wanted to...uh they didn't want to allow the\nGermans, you know, to advance to...to do... They had to cut the Germans [off]. So the\nRussians came, and the Germans left. So they uh tried to cut.

        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Yah. Yah. We...we stayed there 1n the cellars all the time, you know, with pots and pans over\nour heads. And scared to death, really. Because they were heavy bombardments. Because as\nI said, beside the oil areas--uh, Ploie ti is a city very close to Bucharest. Very close. And so\nthey crossed...you know, they flew over Bucharest to go to Ploie ti, you know; and from\nPloie ti to Bucharest. And to cut the...the Germans--who were, you know, advancing. And\num...so they bombard Bucharest and Ploie_ti and other cities. So it was very, very scary, and\nvery... You...you could be killed. We spent almost all the time in the cellars. Yah. The bombs\nwere fall...falling, you know, very close to our house.",
        "Q: Tell us about what happened after that.",
        "A: Yah. After uh then, the Russian, uh they liberated. So we said, \"Now, we'll have freedom.\nAnd our life will be much better and easier.\" You know, the Communists, they came to\npower. Of course, it was better in a way. But uh still, you know, um...you couldn't uh be very\nhappy.

But then, 1t was\nagain uh hard...hard. Because they started to...to close, you know; to uh give less uh\nopportunities and um \"advantages,\" how to say, you know, for the Jewish people. So we\nstarted to think, you know, for the future of our daughter, especially, you know.",
        "Q: Wait. Let's back up, because I didn't know you'd gotten married.",

So\nhe came over there. And so we met at the Writer's Union. And then, after two years we got\nmarried. Yah. And um we...we had our daughter. And then, we said... We couldn't leave\nearlier, because my parents have been very sick. My father died, then my mother was very\nsick. So we couldn't leave earlier. We wanted to leave earlier, but we had to stay with my\nmother. You know, we couldn't leave her. Because my sister, she left before, the country.\nAnd um...when we heard... You know, after my mother died...after almost two years, we...we\nleft the country. We...we uh started, we...we decided to emigrate, you know.",
        "Q: And this was in what year?",
        "A: In '76. Yah. In '76, we came here. So, as I said, for uh...we are not anymore young people.\nAnd it's hard to start from the beginning. So...but we saw just that our daughter wouldn't\nhave any...any future, you know. Because they always asked about your background, if you\nwant to go...she wanted to go uh to uh the university, you know. Uh, they...the Communists\nalways said, you know, \"Your background is not good. You are not from uh workers, you\nknow...'background,' how to say, you know.\" If you are intellectual or something, or if your\nparents had a shop, you know, it means you are not good uh citizens, how to say. Not the\nright uh level. So 1t would have been very, very hard for her to get into the university, you\nknow, to...to learn, to study. And um...we said that uh we have to think at her future, you\nknow. And that's why we decided to...to leave. It was hard to start from the beginning, and at\nour age. But for..just for her, we decided that we have to leave. And we are really very glad\nthat here she had the opportunity. And she could go to school and um...uh study and um...\nIt's really a great country, where if somebody works hard and wants to achieve something,\nyou know. And you have all the opportunities and all the uh doors open, how to say. And\num...uh regardless of your beliefs or, you know, race or whatever, you can really achieve\nwhatever you want if you really want and work hard, you know. And the freedom, that's\nsomething that it's the first, you know, the most uh...uh wonderful thing, you know, that you\ncan have, really.",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add?",
        "A: Uh, well, that's uh...I'm...we are really very happy here, and um we are very uh grateful that\nuh this country, you know, allowed us to...to come here and um to...to work and to be free.\nAnd um...for our daughter to...to achieve something, you know, to do whatever she wanted\nto do and to...to be able to raise a family.
