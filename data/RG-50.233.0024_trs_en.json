        "ENGEL, Selma\nRG-50.233*0024\nFebruary 28, 1992\nAbstract\nSelma Engel 1s interviewed regarding her family and her early family life in Holland. Her\nmother, Alidy Nathans Wijnberg was born on April 10, 1887 in Vries, Holland. She was the\neldest of eight children. As a teenager, her mother sold textiles from the family textile store to\nfarmers. She married in 1909 (?) and became President of her Hadassah group in Zwolle,\nHolland. Selma was born in Zwolle where her parents ran a kosher hotel after their brush factory\nwent bankrupt. Selma, who enjoyed swimming, was the only girl, the youngest of four children.\nThey all attended Dutch public school and Hebrew afternoon school. The eldest was Braham,\nborn on May 14, 1916. Although he had a scholarship to go to college, he could not attend\nbecause he had to help in the hotel when it was just getting started. Later, he went to hotel\nschool and also became a dance master. He was hidden during the war along with his wife and\nchildren. After the war he took over the hotel, but ran into problems with the police when he\nrefused to do business with any Germans. He and his family then emigrated to Toronto, Canada.\nThe other brothers were Marthyn and Maurits. Marthyn was born on December 23, 1920, and\nplayed the violin, piano, saxophone, and accordion. He became a fine baker after attending\nculinary school, and at 18, worked as a headmaster at a fine pastry place in Rotterdam. He was a\nsergeant in the military and ten days after the war began, he returned to Zwolle and hid. He and\nSelma helped the mother in the hotel. Maurits was born in De Leek on January 10, 1918, four\nyears before Selma. He was very sick with meningitis when he was 12. After high school, he\nattended textile school to learn the business. He enjoyed ice skating, and took Selma to the\nmovies and dancing. Around age 21 or 22, he married a Jewish woman, Bep Jakobs, during the\nwar, and first they were hidden and then later sent to Poland. Their father died in 1941, anda\nmaid cared for Selma because her mother was busy with the hotel. The family was kosher and\nobservant, although very assimilated. The brothers played cards on the Sabbath when the parents\nwere out. In 1942, the Germans threw the family out of their hotel and placed them in a small\nhouse with no electricity or bathroom. Selma hid; she said goodbye to her mother and brothers\nin July 1942, and never saw them again. She was sent to Sobibor the following year when her\nmother was sent to Poland. Selma said that her brothers, Maurits and Marthyn, were sent to a\nwork camp, like \u201call the Jews in Holland.\u201d She said that almost all of the Jews who had lived in\nnorthern Holland, were killed. Most of the survivors went to Israel, and a few went to America.\nSelma mentioned that all small towns in Holland have memorials to the Jews who were killed\nduring the war.\nSelma also tells how at the beginning of the war and in 1945 their hotel was used as a place to\nhide German Jews who were smuggled to Belgium.\nSIDE A",
        "It\u2019s Friday, February 28\" and we are speaking with Selma Engel in Branford, Connecticut\nabout her mother, Alidy Nathans Wijnberg. Mrs. Engel, could you tell us a little bit about\nyour mother, her date of birth, where she was born?\nHer date of birth was 1887, April 10 and she was born in Holland; in a very small town. Not\nmany Jews lived, and I remember that my mother told me there was a lot of anti-Semitism. It\nwas in Vries in Drenthe in Holland. My mother come from a family from eight children. She\nwas the oldest; and they had a store, a textile store. I remember we were once in Holland, and\nsomebody showed us this store. My mother went to the farmers on a bicycle; and she had the\nsuitcases in the front of the bicycle; and she went selling textiles, as she had to do a lot of helping\nfor the whole family.\nThis was when she was a teenager?\nYeah.\nOr younger?\nNo, it was a teenager, I think; that I don\u2019t know exactly, I think like a teenager. My mother got\nmarried very late in life. I think they got shadchaned (ph? c. 14). In that time they put people\ntogether, man and wife. I think my mother was not young, and my father was also not young\nwhen they got married. So...\nDo you know much about her education?\nNo, I don\u2019t. She was a very intelligent woman. She read a lot, and she was president in my\nhome \u2014 in Zwolle, in Holland. My parents had their own hotel and she was president from\nHadassah.\nOkay, could you tell me once again the name of that organization?\nIt was Practice (ph? c. 20) Palestine Work. It was something from Jews in Holland; had worked\nfor Israel. It was not Israel in that time, it was Palestine. My mother was president from the\ngroup, and I remember she had to make a speech and worked together with my brother on it.\nThey were very active in a Jewish \u2014 a Jewish temple in my hometown, in Zwolle.\nDo you know of anything else about her childhood, or her youth, or the year that she got\nmarried?\nNo, I don\u2019t know much about it. Somehow, I put that really out of my mind. No, I don\u2019t know.\nMaybe we should move up to Zwolle. This is where she and your father settled?\nNo. My father and mother had a brush factory in Groningen; that\u2019s not far from where my\nmother lived. In 1929, the difficult time, they went bankrupt. So they had to do something else;\nand they bought a hotel, a kosher hotel, in Zwolle, that\u2019s another state, Overijssel. That was the\nonly kosher hotel. My father and mother worked that \u2018til they went \u2014 my father died in 1941\u2014\nuntil they went to the concentration camp. My mother was very active in Drenthe (? c. 34) when\nshe lived there.",
        "Why don\u2019t you tell us a little about your family? When did your mother start having\nchildren, and how many children did she have?\nWe \u2014 I don\u2019t remember when my mother had children. I was the youngest from the four\nchildren and the only girl. I had two, three older brothers; one was two years older, one was four\nyears older, and one was six years older. The one what was six years older was Braham, and he\nwas hidden in the war; and he got out of it. He had himself four children, and he came alive out\nof the war with his wife and the four children. I had two other brothers, one was named Marthyn\n(Marthijn), we have a picture of him; and one was named Maurits. What you want to know\nmore? We had a very nice family. We went bicycle riding a lot, and we fought a lot. We lived\n\u2014 my parents had a hotel on a cattle market, and it came a lot of Jewish salesmen; they slept\novernight in our hotel. It was very Jewish oriented; still, we didn\u2019t wear payos (peyes, peyess,\npeyos, payas) or stuff like that. We were religious, but very assimilated; and religious. My\nmother, when my brothers were young, they had to lay tefillin and all these things. Still, it was\nvery different than in Poland; and much more assimilated. I had a lot of not Jewish girlfriends; I\nstayed overnight there. I remember I had to take my own sandwich with me when I went there,\nbut we had a lot of non-Jewish people. And also when we were always \u2014 prayers on Shabbat,\nafter dinner, that we always did that. Not the outside world; it was always private, things like\nthat. My brothers \u2014 one brother went to college. We had a \u2014.\nIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d just like to go back a little. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about\nyour mother as a person, what was she like?\nMy mother was a very nice person; she was always very happy, and she was singing a lot. I\ndon\u2019t remember everything exactly; somehow, I don\u2019t remember much when I was young. I\nvery completely \u2014 I don\u2019t know; I try to block it out perhaps, I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t\nremember. I remember that my mother was very religious, and she prayed in the morning and in\nthe afternoon; especially when difficult times. We had to go every Friday evening, every\nShabbos morning we had to go the temple. Then we came home, and we had, you know, nice\nthings, lunch together, very fresh (?) cholent (c. 65) together. Also Friday evening there was a\nvery big thing always with Kabbalat Shabbat. Also in the evening the making the end of the\nShabbat; it was very religious. And also with Passover, everything is changed. We had a hotel,\nso there was a lot of work; all the glasswork had to be kosher-made. My mother was a very\nreligious person; my father was not, but my mother was very religious. And the hotel was also a\nkosher hotel, strict kosher. Many times there was the old rabbi standing in the hotel when there\nwas dinners, from the kosher thing. ___(c. 71). My mother was a very nice person, and very\npleasant. What it was, they were always very busy in the business, 1n the hotel. Because in the\nevening there were so many salesmen stayed overnight; so I was never allowed to come in the\nroom, the hall where they was sitting, most of the time. So the maid brought me to bed; I\u2019m\nreally brought up by the maid, I think, because I don\u2019t remember much that my mother went to\nme and kissed me good-night or something like that. I don\u2019t know; in Holland, they are much\ncolder, I think, the people. They didn\u2019t kiss so much, and they didn\u2019t show so much the affection\nto each other. I remember when I once lay on my mother\u2019s shoulder that my brother said, don\u2019t\ndo so childish or so. You know, the people in Holland were not too affectionate. That is really",
        "what she was \u2014 a very strong, capable person. Of course, it was the religion, I think, that helped\nher a lot; because my father died in 1941, and she had the whole load on her shoulders by\nherself. In the beginning of 1942, she had to go out of the hotel, and she was a very strong\nperson; much stronger than I am, I think, very strong, very business-like, very intelligent.\nDo you remember any particular times that you spent together? Any particular trip that\nyou took or anything like that?\nMy father and mother never took vacations. They went \u2014 they only worked. I remember they\nwent when there was something from the Queen, in The Hague (? c. 88). Then they took a taxi,\nand they went to The Hague and saw the Queen and the King; not the king, the prince. The\nQueen, they saw her, and that was for her the biggest thing. I don\u2019t remember that my father and\nmother ever went on vacation, never. They always worked; that was the system. I don\u2019t\nremember that they took vacations, no. I don\u2019t remember \u2014 we went on Shabbat\u2014on Shabbos\nwe went, walked. For hours, we walked; my mother and my father and I. My brothers never\nwent; my brothers stayed always home with friends and played cards. But my mother, when my\nmother came in, there was not allowed on Shabbat. I remember that I had to walk with them.\nThey came together a lot with friends; was very nice Jewish kehillah, community, very nice. A\nlot of things going on always in the hotel, Jewish. There was a Jewish organization and kept the\nclubs in our hotel, and we had something to do. And then we went to Sunday school, and there\nwas parties always from Sunday school. There was a very large community, Jewish community,\nand very active.\nThat\u2019s nice.\nYeah, it was really very nice. I had a very nice youth, very nice. I went to camp when I was\nyoung, Zionist camp, and there was lands en trein veer (ph? c.102) came together with all the\nyouth from Holland. I know a lot of people; I had a lot of Jewish friends also in other towns. I\nwent to visit other people in other towns. It was very nice. When my father and mother worked\nvery hard, yeah; we had it perhaps, easier.\nIs there any way that we can get a little bit closer type to the period between 1940 and 1944\nthat you know what happened to your mother? Is there anything that you might know,\nmaybe you could tell me?\nWhat it has to do with the war?\nYes.\nMy mother\u2014in 1942 the Germans came and told my mother that she has to go out of the hotel.\nThey put her in a very small house; very poor neighborhood.\nThis was in Zwolle?\nEverything was Zwolle. Z-o-w-l-l-e.\nZ-w-0.",
        "Oh, yeah, yeah. I told you that we were once picked up and sent\u2014. She was a very strong\nperson. Also, I don\u2019t know, she never showed really her fear for anything. I remember that she\nwas always knitting; she knitted everything for me. She was always knitting; she knit whole\nsuits and socks and stockings and sweaters. She was always knitting in that poor house, that\nlittle house where we lived. There was no electricity; there was no bathroom; there was \u2014\nbarrel, came once a week to empty it; was no shower there. I thought it was horrible. I didn\u2019t\nwant to stay there; I didn\u2019t stay there much.\nHow long were you there?\nThat was in 1942. So I went in 1943; I went away from home and was hidden in another place.\nMy mother stayed there \u2018til 1943; in 1943, they sent her away.\nYou don\u2019t know what month that was?\nI don\u2019t know; I never wanted to know.\nWe have a correction. We were going to go back, and it was still in 1942\u2014.\n1942. Because in 1943, I went already to Sobibor. In 1942, I was hidden. And my mother in\nthe time that I was hidden, somebody told me, that on the way out, that she was planning to go\nand hide somewhere. The police came, and I think that perhaps the Gestapo; and they picked her\nup and sent her to Poland. So that\u2019s all that I know about my mother. My brothers are living; I\nnever exactly found out. I really never wanted to know. Lately, now we talk more about it, I\nthink I should find out; I really don\u2019t want to know. Because I don\u2019t want to know if they\nsuffered a lot, and when I know what camp they went, it suffered more; and I hope that they\nwent to a camp like Sobibor that they went right away to the gas chamber. So I really never\nwanted to know exactly because it doesn\u2019t make me happier; doesn\u2019t fulfill my life when I know.\nWell, thank you very much. Maybe we should move on now to talk about your brothers.\nPm sorry this is a difficult topic but thank you. Okay, we\u2019re now talking with Mrs. Engel\nabout her brother, ..\nMarthyn.\nMarthyn Wijnberg. Mrs. Engel what can you tell us about your brother? When was he\nborn?\nHe was born in December 23, 1920. He was two years older than Iam. I remember that we\nwent every Sunday bicycle riding; before breakfast we went to a little town. We drove 20, 30\nmiles every Sunday morning, and then we came back for breakfast. We were always singing, the\nbathroom was downstairs and his was upstairs, and we were always singing. He could sing very\nbeautiful; he was very musical inclined. We got along very well. We had a very\u2014. I remember\nwhen we were young. We were\u2014we had a very nice time together. We were already teenagers;\nthat\u2019s the time I can remember the most.\nWhat type of schools did he attend?",
        "He went high school; he went to a culinary school too. He was a very good, exceptional fine\nbakery, but the same bakery what they do in Holland. In Holland they have very fine pastry, and\nhe was very, very good in it. He could make a \u2014 I remember he made once a very large bridge\nfrom sugar, you know. Yeah, very large; and it was in our hotel in one of the cabinets; and it\nwas dancing evening, and the thing broke. Very fine make; he really could paint from marzipan.\nIn Holland this is very big, the pastry business; and he was very good at it. Also he could play\nmusic; any instrument. He could play the piano and saxophone and accordion. We had always a\nlot of fun with him. That he did\u2014. You know, one brother played the piano, and he played on\nthe accordion or the violin. It was very nice. We had a very nice\u2014. We went\u2014I went\u2014he was\nvery young already and went out of the house.\nAbout what age?\nI think he was 17, 18. So I don\u2019t remember so much what we did together. He went also to\nschool away from home, so I don\u2019t remember so much that I went out with him.\nCan we just back up for a minute? Can you tell me what type of schools\u2014were these\nDutch public schools?\nOh, yeah, Dutch public schools. After school, every day, we went to a Hebrew school; I hated it.\nWhen we went\u2014we had to go every day after school; we went to Hebrew school.\nOh, every day?\nEvery day; not a Friday, but every other day we had to go. I don\u2019t remember Sunday, but I know\nafter school we had to go there.\nDid you learn Hebrew there?\nYeah, we learned Hebrew there, and we learned history. We got Jewish education in this school,\noh yeah.\nThese were Zionistly inclined schools?\nNo, that was not Zionistly inclined. Was a Zionist organization in my home town, a youth\norganization; and I was really the only one of all the kids, from the four kids, that was very\nactive in it. Went to a Zionist camp in the summer, and we went bicycle riding and met other\ngroups to other little towns. There was all little towns; all over lived Jews. A lot of Jewish\npeople lived in the whole area outside\u2014very small towns. In every small town was a synagogue\nin Holland. Then we came together always, every other Sunday, and it was very active always\nwith the...\nBut Marthyn was not as involved as\u2014\nNo, he was not so much involved in that somehow. The other brothers were not so much\ninvolved. Maurits was more involved, but Marthyn was not involved, and my oldest brother was\nnot so much involved.\nDid he go out\u2014was he in any bands or anything if he was so musical?",
        "No, there was no such a ... I don\u2019t remember that really. He was away; he went to school, and\nhe had to make a living. I don\u2019t remember that. I really don\u2019t remember that; that he was in a\nband.\nWhen he left the house, you said as a late teenager, is that when he went to go to the\nculinary school?\nYes, he went to the culinary school. Then he went, when he was 18, he went working in\nRotterdam; he was in a very fine place. He was the headmaster already from that place for\npastry. Big business was that. He was a very charming guy.\nHe had a lot of friends growing up?\nI don\u2019t know. Yeah, he had friends; he lived still. Friends what he had, I know. He had very\nclose friends, and he lived still in Holland. When we were at Maten (? c. 195) Holland, I met\nthis friend, and he told me about him. They were very close friends. This friend is very, very\nreligious, now in Holland. He doesn\u2019t take the telephone; he teaches Sunday school; he has the\nsynagogue; he\u2019s the president from the synagogue. So we come from a very religious\nbackground, very religious. I never had anything that was not kosher, you know. First thing I\nhad not kosher was in concentration camp. Perhaps in jail or somewhat...\nSo do you know what happened to Marthyn after\u2014?\nNot exactly, I don\u2019t exactly\u2014what was going on. I really don\u2019t\u2014I never want to find out\nexactly\u2014that was my whole system really. That I never want to go ...\nAll right. So basically after he had left home and gone to the culinary institute, did he come\nback to Zwolle?\nYeah, he came back in the war; he came back to Zwolle.\nAbout what year was that?\nHe was in the military.\nHe was?\nHe was in the military, and he was a sergeant in the military. He was in the war too. He fought\nin the war.\nIn World War IT?\nYeah, in World War II. Well, only ten days; the war was only ten days. But he was in the war,\nand he was in the military from the beginning of the war\u2014already before the war, he was a\nmilitary.\nHe had been conscripted? There was a draft?\nYeah, there was a draft, yeah. He was in the...\nThen he came back to the family (? c. 214).",
        "Yeah, he came back to the family after the war. He came back to his family, and then we had to\ngo out of the hotel. Then he stayed also in the\u2014he slept in the hotel\u2014in that little house. But I\ndon\u2019t remember so much in daytime. He was always out with friends; that\u2019s what I remember.\nAt that time, we didn\u2019t have so much contact with him. When I went away from home, in 1942\nalready, I was away. It was already in July, 1942, I say goodbye to my brothers and my mother;\nI never saw them again. That was the last time I saw. After the war, I was so occupied with my\nown life, I think, that I didn\u2019t want to know exactly what.\nWhen you say that he was out with friends, was it dangerous for people, for Jews to be out\nor \u2014?\nNo, not in daytime. It was dangerous ever, and I think, perhaps, he stayed overnight. I don\u2019t\nremember much, I really don\u2019t remember.\nFor example, could you go in the street and buy groceries and things like that? Or I mean\nthere probably weren\u2019t too many groceries at a certain point, but\u2014?\nI don\u2019t remember.\nYou don\u2019t remember.\nI think\u2014of course we had groceries in the house. In daytime we were allowed to go out.\nBut you had to wear the star?\nI had to wear a star, yeah. I had to wear a star.\nSo basically once you had gone to go into hiding, you didn\u2019t see your brother again.\nNo, I never saw him again.\nYou\u2019re not sure of his fate? You know he was somehow he\u2014?\nWhat it was... I think he was hidden, I remember. He was not home; because in 1941, there\ncame in man to our hotel. He say when you give me money, I will help that your brothers will\nget them to Switzerland. So I give him all the money; he was a traitor, that guy, and I didn\u2019t\nknow. He was a very charming man. He came to our hotel and give lots of money, lots of\nmoney. And he didn\u2019t do anything. So they were hidden; he was hidden. He was not home;\nanyway, he was not home. I don\u2019t know much; he was not home. He was hidden perhaps in the\nwar; he was not home. I don\u2019t remember much, it\u2019s strange. I just put it klun (ph? c.243)\ncompletely out of my mind, all these things. I should go and be hypnotized.\nMaybe you\u2014.\nWho cares? He\u2019s gone. They\u2019re dead.\nWell, I think\u2014.",
        "They\u2019re dead, and my kids never ask about it; and then they never want to know about it.\nNobody wants to know about it. I know that he was sent to Poland; but what it was; now I\nremember. This brother had to go to a work camp.\nWhat was his name?\nMaurits; he had to go to a work camp, work camp. All the Jews in Holland \u2014 had to go, were\nmade \u2014they had to go to a work camp; weekends, sometimes home. And he say when he goes\nto a work camp, I go too; when I can help him. So he went free over to the work camp.\nMarthyn joined your other brother?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, to the work camp.\nBut they were not incarcerated there? They didn\u2019t have to sleep there?\nOh, yeah, they had to sleep there. They went away for the whole week, and on weekends\nsometimes they came home from the beginning. Weekends they came home. So the Germans\ndid as soon as the people went home...\nOkay, we had a brief interruption, but we were just finishing up about what you were\ntelling me about Marthyn.\nMarthyn. Just Marthyn.\nYes.\nIt\u2019s not written here.\nWell, it must be some\u2014we\u2019re looking at the picture. And there, a picture of Marthyn and\nhis friend with...\nYeah, but you don\u2019t want to make a picture from this star, with a Jewish star. It was very\nimportant to them that they have a picture. They went to a real photographer and had a picture\nmade from Jewish star; so idiot. Yeah, joke. You see how they can joke...\nYes, yes. OK. Well, thank you very much for this information, and we can move on now to\ntalk about one of your other brothers.\nYeah.\nOkay, we\u2019re talking with Selma Engel about her brother Maurits, Maurits Wijnberg.\nHe was a very nice guy, a very soft-spoken nice boy. He went always skating, and he was once\nvery sick. When he was twelve years old, he had meningitis.\nMeningitis, oh my.\nYeah. He was very , very sick. I remember that my father and mother put hay on the street that\nthe cars didn\u2019t make too much noise in the hotel, in another hotel. When my father and mother\nbuild it later, this new hotel in Zwolle, not new any more, of course. He was very, very sick. I",
        "think he came out very well because he went to high school. He had studied very hard, much\nharder after the sickness, I think. He went to high school, and he helped a lot in the hotel. He\nwent to a textile school and learned for business; he was in business.\nCan we back up for one second?\nYeah.\nCan you tell me his date of birth and where he was born?\nHe was born in De Leek next to Groningen. He was born in January 10, I think, 1918. He was\nfour years older than Iam. He was very active also in the Zionist organization. He was the only\none from the boys that was active, active in the Zionist organization together with me. We went\nalways there together. He went out a lot with not Jewish girls, I remember. My father and\nmother were very upset about it \u2014 when he was young.\nEven though he was in the Zionist\u2014?\nYeah, yeah, yeah. He had a lot of not Jewish girls. He went skating with them, and he took me\nout always to the movies. When we were dancing, organizations, he took me out dancing. No,\nhe was a very\u2014he was very young already\u2014had later on not Jewish, Jewish girlfriend. That\u2019s\nthe girl that he married to. He got married in the war, so he was very young. He got married\nwhen he was 21; 21, 22. He got also married to a not Jewish \u2014 to a Jewish girl, a Jewish girl. I\nhave a picture from her, too. He was hidden. I don\u2019t remember much what we did when we\nwere children. I don\u2019t remember much. I remember that he had a lot of\u2014we had a lot of Jewish\nfriends; and Shabbos when my father and mother were not home, they played cards. When my\nfather and mother was there, they were not allowed to play cards on Shabbat. When they came\nhome, they put the cards quickly under the table so my mother wouldn\u2019t see it; that I remember.\nBut I don\u2019t remember much about him at all. I don\u2019t remember much, I don\u2019t\u2014it somehow...\nYou were telling me that he hadn\u2019t studied tech, he went to a business school?\nYeah, he went to a special\u2014Handelsschool (ph, c. 303), that was in Holland. He went to that\nschool.\nWhere was it located?\nIn Zwolle, in my hometown. Later he went to a business school, that I remember; he went to a\nbusiness school. I remember that he was very young already. He was 17, 18; he went with this\nJewish girl later on \u2014Bep Davidson, Beppie (Betje) Davidson, Davidson. [Note: last name was\nmore likely Jakobs; her sister married Dolf Davidson].\nDo you know how to spell that?\nDavidson.\nOh, no, no. The first name?\nBep. B-e-p. She\u2014they went very young already together. Then they broke up; they went\ntogether again; finally they got married \u2014in the war they got married. I remember he was\u2014you",
        "were not allowed from the Germans to exchange your address, so he went at 11 o\u2019clock, dark on\nthe side of the houses, he went to her house. He was sure that in the morning before\u2014very early\nin the morning\u2014it was very dangerous what he did\u2014he came back to the house again. So, but\nhe was a lot with my mother and also his wife. They were a lot in my mother\u2019s little\u2014that house\nafter the war. He helped a lot my mother also when my father died in 1940; he helped my\nmother a lot in the hotel. My oldest brother was married already, and he was not home anymore.\nSo he helped my mother a lot. He and I, I don\u2019t remember, he and I went very early over in the\nmorning and made coffee for the people that came to the hotel. We made breakfast together for\nthe people in the hotel. Yeah, that I forgot. But\u2014he was a very big help for my mother, much\nmore than I am; I remember. But he was a big help, and he helped my mother a lot. He was\nhidden.\nWhen did he leave the little house to go into hiding?\nHe was\u2014when we lived in the little house, he was hidden. Then they told my sister-in-law, he\nwas married already then; that when somebody in the family was hiding, that her father had to go\nto Poland right away or had to go to camp. So he came out of the hiding place because his wife,\nthat was his wife already, told him to get out of this hiding place. Then I went already very early\nout of the house, it was in July, 1942; I went away so I don\u2019t know exactly what was going on\nthen. I didn\u2019t have any contact with them; only that I know that they were all sent to Poland.\nWho told his wife this, that they would be\u2014?\nI don\u2019t know; it was just a rumor, what goes around. The Jewish (Joodse, Joodsche) Raad; there\nwas a Jewish group of Jewish people what helped the Germans really to organize everything.\nThat was very active in Holland, I think. So anyway, somehow there was \u2014 and he was \u2014\nthat\u2019s the way he went out of the hiding place, and he went together with her. I think \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow together with her; I don\u2019t know how they went over to Poland; I don\u2019t know. I never\nfound out anything.\nThat was in \u201942?\nThat was in \u201942, yeah, 1942. Very surely in the area where we lived; much more than in\nAmsterdam. In Amsterdam, was the underground much quicker and was already going on in\nthere. The Jews were\u2014our life much more from Amsterdam area. But the Jews lived northern\nHolland where I come from, they all got killed; almost nobody left. The few what are left, they\nlive in Israel. There\u2019s a lot of Dutch, not a lot; there are Dutch Jews what are alive, they all\nwent away to Israel. The most other to America, but not many to America; the most went to\nIsrael. They\u2014but I know that all little towns where you go now in Holland, you see all\nmemorials in every little town. In every little town there was a Jewish community; they all had\nsynagogues there. In all these little towns where I come from, from northern Holland \u2014 from\nOverijssel, Drenthe, Groningen \u2014 all province like Connecticut; there\u2019s nothing left. In\nFriesland there\u2019s nothing left. They all got killed in early \u201942; a lot got caught too.",
        "Can we try to shift back a little? You said your brother was very\u2014do you know of his\nother interests? You said he was very soft-spoken and nice. Did he have any hobbies like\nyour other brother, or\u2014?\nHe was\u2014no, I don\u2019t remember. I remember he was active in the Jewish organization, also in the\nZionist organization. I remember that the war broke out in 1940; that he was there, and he\nhelped my mother a lot in the hotel in that time. He was already very young with this Bep; was\nvery young, they went together. So they went ice-skating together, and that\u2019s what I remember.\nI don\u2019t remember much that he had hobbies and things like that, no; I don\u2019t, no.\nOkay, that\u2019s fine. So is there anything else you\u2019d like to tell me about your brother\nMaurits?\nNo, that\u2019s what I remember. He went to Handelsschool. He did the high school and went to the\ncollege there.\nHandel as in the composer? H-a-n-d-e-l.\nHandelsschool, yes. There was like a MULO, like in high school, like in high school; especially\nfor business. Yeah. He studied always, he studied always; that I remember. Then he met this\ngirl, and he was a lot over her house. So that\u2019s the ... And I was a lot out of the house; then\nwhen the war broke out, and I was not much home. When we were younger, I really don\u2019t\nremember much. I somehow put things out of my memory (? c. 388). We had a very nice life,\nlike the kids here. We went out, lots ski; he went always ice skating. I went swimming a lot, so\nwe didn\u2019t have the same interests. I went every day swimming, and he went more with the boys\nout. He studied a lot; he went to school and studied a lot. I went ice skate ... , swimming a lot\nand every day, so we didn\u2019t have much ...\nIf he was going ice skating, where were you\u2014you were swimming in the winter or \u2014?\nIn the winter, yes. We went the whole winter through. There was a house where you could\nswim.\nOh an indoor, an indoor\u2014?\nAn indoor swimming pool, oh yeah, an indoor swimming pool; not outdoors.\nYou were that \u2014?\nNo, no, no. In the indoor swimming pool in Holland; I forgot the name. There was an outdoor\nswimming pool also in my hometown. In summer I went on the bicycle; and I remember I had\nthe bicycle; I had to bring food to the Jewish patients in the hospital on the bicycle. He went too\na lot; he did. We helped my mother a lot after my father died. He was a very big help in the\nhotel. My other brother was married, so he helped my mother in the hotel.\nOkay, well that\u2019s great. Thank you very, very much.\nSIDE B",
        "February 6.\nOK. Do you know anything about his childhood \u2014 what type of an education he had, what\nkind of a family?\nNo. His father and mother had a factory in \u2014 no, his father went, made brushes and made from\nrotan. (ph? c. 03) or \u2014 see like that.\nOh, a rug.\nYeah; a rug cleaner. Yeah, he and my grandfather went to the farmers to sell 1t from door by\ndoor. They were very, very poor. And later on they started a little factory, and my father had,\ntogether with his brother, a factory \u2014 made brushes. And my father traveled always to Germany\non the motorcycle, and he sold the business in Germany. That\u2019s what I know.\nWere they religious Jews?\nNo, they\u2019re not religious. No, my father was not comnatra (ph? c. 10). Very Jewish, I think,\nwhen they came from a small town, De Leek; very small town. But they were not very religious;\nno, no, no.\nDid he have brothers and sisters?\nYeah, he had six brothers and sisters; six or seven brothers and sisters.\nWow. OK, so do you know anything about closer to his adulthood, like how he met your\nmother?\nI think they were brought together; marriage \u2014 how you call that?\nArranged marriage.\nArranged marriage, yes; an arranged marriage. My mother was very orthodox and come from a\nvery orthodox family; and my father was not orthodox. Very orthodox was my mother \u2014 from\nAgudah (ph? c. 16).\nReally?\nYes, very orthodox; and my father was not orthodox. I remember as a child, and Friday evening\nwe were not allowed to put electricity out; and the maid was not there, so my father\u2019s hands put\nthe lights out. My father was very charming man, he was very good-looking, he could sing very\nnice; and my mother was really the businesswoman. And my father helped, cooked in the ....\nMy father was also baker a short time, because in the hotel he made cake; he made special Dutch\ncake, boterkoek he made; and he baked raisin bread, and he cooked a lot. My father cooked a lot\nin the kitchen. And my mother did was always in the front, in the business; and that\u2019s really....\nAnd he was very .... I remember when the waiters in the hotel didn\u2019t have a good day, that he\nput always some money on the floor; so when they clean the floor, that they found some money.\nAnd he was a very generous man, very generous. He \u2014 I mean on Friday evening he bought\nalways so much fruit \u2014 all different kind of things that we had on Friday evening for Kabbalat",
        "Shabbat; we made very big. What I remember more from my father? He was very generous\nguy; everybody liked him.\nYou said in 1929 is when they bought the hotel?\nYeah. My father and mother lost de daad (ph? c.29). In 1929 they lost everything, in the\nfactory; in the brush factory when everything got electric, get mechanical done, so they .... The\nbusiness didn\u2019t do well, and they sold it; and then the family helped of course. And they bought\na hotel, a kosher hotel, in Zwolle, in Holland; that was 1931. And that hotel was on a cattle\nmarket; but they moved that cattle market two years later. But they didn\u2019t know when they\nbought the hotel, and they had to build a new hotel on the new cattle market; and that was also in\nZwolle. And \u2014 Daddy (ph? c.36) did very well; 1t was very hard, when they didn\u2019t have so\nmuch money when they lost the money in 1929. And they had to build up the hotel; and got\nloans from the beer factories and from the banks and .... Later on, I remember when I was a\nteenager, they did already very well. It was already out of the difficult times.\nOK. And you said that your father died in 1940?\nNo, my father died in 19 \u2014 41 or \u00b040?\n5701\nYeah.

And it was good; then he\u2019s buried in\nHolland.\nSo he hadn\u2019t really experienced too much of the ...\nNo, nothing at all; no, no, almost nothing at all. I don\u2019t think so; no.\nOK, but do you think it was part of the pressure of what was going on with the Nazis\ninvading?\nPossible, possible; that had something to do with the heart attack.\nWas there talk of that in your family when ...?\nOf course; when the war broke out, we did; we right away saw .... We never saw there was a\nconcentration camp, gas chambers, but .... I was a tomboy, and I was very young. I was \u2014 not",
        "so young \u2014 I was 18. I never \u2014 talked seriously; they never talked with me when I was there\naround, like money worries, not. And, so \u2014 of course, we talked about it. When all the\nGerman Jews came to our hotel, and they stayed overnight many times in the hotel; and then they\nwere smuggled to Belgium. And then when boats went away from there; so we had a lot of\npeople always overnight when we had, were still in the hotel. We get also after the war, we did a\nlot of people came over to the hotel, and they were smuggled out, and slept in the attic.\nOh really?\nYeah. A lot of from the camps slept in the attic with us and were smuggled to Belgium and \u2014\nWas your father involved in helping any of these, or was this afterwards?\nI don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember. But that\u2019s what I tell .... What\u2019s also in the war we had a\nlot of Germans came to our hotel, German Jews, and stayed in the hotel overnight and when\nsmuggled someplace else; in the beginning, yeah. But also in 1945, that was already after the\nwar, we had a lot of Jewish people that stayed in the attic the whole night, and we give them\nfood; 50, 60 stayed in the attic, slept \u2014 we had the beds on the floor. And then they were picked\nup and cycled (ph? c. 62) in the evening, and they were sent to Belgium; I think like that.\nWhen would that begin \u2014 the smuggling? Do you know what year, approximately?\nThat was in 1945 already.\nOh, after ...\nAlso, in the war, that was in the very beginning, very beginning; yeah, very beginning \u2014 in\n1940.\n1940?\nYeah, yeah, 1940; that we had the Jews in the hotel.\nAnd you knew that this was going on?\nOf course you knew. The help (? c. 67) was not allowed to talk about it with anybody; and\nnobody came to the hotel and things like that. But it was very short time that could have done.\nRight. OK. Well, is there anything else you\u2019d like to tell me about what you can\nremember? About your father?\nNo.\nNo? That should do it.\nYeah, that should do it.\nOK; all right. Thank you very much.\nYou\u2019re welcome.",
        "OK. We\u2019re speaking with Selma Engel about her late sister-in-law, Bep Jakobs. Mrs.\nEngel, what can you tell us about Bep? What do you know anything about her birthday or\nwhen she was born?\nShe was born in Emmen in, also in Drenthe; in Overijssel is a little town and she comes ... Her\nfather and mother had a very beautiful store in Zwolle.\nWhat type of store?\nA big sports store; very, very, they did very, very well. And she had another sister, \u201cvoti ellipse\u201d\n(ph? c. 75), in Holland, in Zwolle. And they went toget ... my brother and her they went\ntogether when they was 16. And my father and mother were a little bit against it; I don\u2019t know\nwhy, since we were not so rich ... (? c.78); they were very well to do already. And they ..., I\nknow she was a very nice person; and they went ice skating together. And she was very musical;\nshe played beautiful piano. And she went to college.\nOh. Do you know what she studied?\nI don\u2019t know; no, no. I think she just went to high ... like gymnasiums.\nRight, right.\nBut it\u2019s like a college here \u2014 gymnasium. She was very intelligent; she was very business-like;\nand I know that she was very nice. And she came always; in the war she stayed with my mother\nwhen I wasn\u2019t there, and also Maurits was with the mother. And they were very much in love\nand was a very nice couple together. And she played tennis; I know remember she plays tennis.\nWas she involved in any of the Jewish groups, do you know?\nNo, no. She was not so much involved in Jewish groups. No; her sister was involved in Jewish\ngroups. She was not so much involved in the Jewish groups. She went to school; and she was\nnot so much in Zwolle that I remember. She was, perhaps, not in the town so ... I, I was not\nfriendly with her; she was two years older, there was a big difference in the age group. I was\nfriendly with her sister. And I don\u2019t think she was from ...; I didn\u2019t see her so much. And, she\nwas a very nice person, she was very close with my mother; there was really very happy with.\nAnd she could knit, and her knitted together also with my mother. They talk about books; she\nread a lot.\nAnd so she married your brother in 1940?\nIn 1940; and she stayed in the parents\u2019 house.\nWas that before your father died that they got married?\nAfter my father died; after my father died.\nAnd she stayed in her parents\u2019 house separately?\nYeah, because she was not allowed from the Germans to change the address. So middle in the\nnight, 11 o\u2019clock it was dark, 10 o\u2019clock it was dark; my brother went dark places and went to",
        "her house. In the morning, early, he came back to our house. When daytime, they were together.\nBut nights, she was not allowed changes from address. And officially, perhaps, the Germans\nwere not allowed them to get married. So that was ...\nAnything else? So she was with you ...\nShe was a big help for my mother to, to ... you know. I was not much home, see, so I don\u2019t\nknow exactly what was going .... I couldn\u2019t sit in a little house; I hated it. So I went away on\nSunday, and I came back Friday evening; something like that.\nSo, the last time you saw her then, would have been in 1942?\nYeah. The last time that I saw her was beginning 1942.\nYou believe that she probably ...\nShe, I think she went, perhaps, together with my brother. Her father and mother would have\nbeen out to, I think, to Auschwitz; they went out to Auschwitz. Anybody would want to know it\nexactly, they could find it out in Westerbork, in the archives in Westerbork. When you want to\nwrite that, they will tell you exactly; the Westerbork of the Red Cross. In Holland, they have it\nexactly written down, and they will tell you exactly. When you want to know, write me a letter.\nExactly, also my brothers and everything, you can find it out exactly in Holland. ... (? c.110). I\nnever want to .... I was always afraid that I would know that they were martyred (? c.110) and\nthings like that, and hoped that they went to a camp like Sobibor always; but they didn\u2019t go to\nSobibor. Oh well, I saw many, many people from my home town walk to the gas chamber.\nSo you said, I\u2019m sorry, just to reiterate; she had one brother and one sister; or one sister?\nNo; she had one sister; one sister, yeah. And her sister lives in Zwolle.\nWhat is her name?\nSaartje.\nHow do you spell that?\nS-A-A-R-T-J-E\nS-A-A-R-T-J-E\nIt\u2019s my maiden name too. (? c.115)\nOK; all right. Well, thank you very much. Is there anything else that you can remember\nthat you\u2019d like to tell us?\nWhat I could tell you about \u2014 my brother, my brother Braham, didn\u2019t tell you anything.\nRight, right. We\u2019ll move on to him.\nNo, I don\u2019t know.\nOK; thank you.",
        "OK. We\u2019re talking with Selma Engel about her brother, Braham Wijnberg. Mrs. Engel,\nwhen was Braham born and where?\nBraham was six years older that I am, so he\u2019s born in 1916 in De Leek, May the 14\".\nAnd what do you remember about him as a youth? He was a bit older, so he would have\nbeen a little bit ahead of you.\nYeah, he was six years older than I am, and he was like my father. He was very wise, and I\ncould always ask him all the questions what I didn\u2019t get from anybody else. And I never went to\nmy father; I went always to him when I want to know things. And he was very intelligent, and\nhe was very nice; and he helped in the hotel. Because he had a scholarship, in Groningen, to go\nto college, but he had to go and help in the hotel because they just started the hotel; and my\nparents couldn\u2019t afford it. So he didn\u2019t go to college. Later, he went to the hotel school; culinary\nschool. Hotel school is that \u2014 in Holland. And he graduated from that, and he helped in the\nhotel many years. And he was also a dance, dancing teacher; because in Holland, when there is a\nparty, there has to be a dance master. For the Holland government you\u2019re not allowed to dance\nwhen there\u2019s no .... So he was very popular in Holland for the not Jewish places. And he was\nvery popular, and he worked very hard, and give also dancing lessons in the hotel; also before\nthe war. And I helped him dancing always.\nDo you remember which dances you would do?\nAny dance; any kind of foxtrot and rumba; and we danced for public. Remember once for 1,000\npeople were watching; we were dancing. And we went to Amsterdam; we learned to dance.\nAnd I danced, I was always dancing with him. She has this picture with my dancing clothes\ntogether with my brother; from this woman. Yeah, he was very, very good brother; we getting\nalong very well. And he took me out a lot, and we had a very nice understanding together.\nSo basically, was he with you in the hotel when the war broke out?\nNo; he got married. He got married in 1940 \u2014 May 8, 1940. He moved out, and he lived in\nUtrecht together with her family. And he was not in the hotel, and he was not in the war time too\nconnected with us at all.\nDo you know what happened to him during the war?\nHe was hidden in the war.\nBy a gentile family?\nBy a gentile family, with his wife; and he got four children in the war. And the one, the\nyoungest, was born after the war. And they all were hidden in the war. And very coincident,\neven the doctor what brought one of the children in the world got in contact with them not long\nago; with one of the girls \u2014 she\u2019s now 46 years old. And the doctor what brought her in the\nworld wanted to now what came out of her.",
        "So during the duration of the war, they weren\u2019t deported?\nNo. They were not deported; they were all hidden in Holland. In Holland, by not Jewish people\n\u2014 different people.\nDid they remain in Holland after the war?\nAnd they remained in Holland after the war when they went to Canada in 1956. They went to\nCanada; they emigrated with the whole family to Toronto, in Canada.\nOK. And the children still live there?\nAnd the children still live there, yeah.\nOK. Well, is there anything else you\u2019d like to tell me about him?\nNo. He died very young; he was very upset what was happened in the war. And he had a\ntremendous guilt feeling, I think, that he didn\u2019t tell my parents, my mother, and my brothers that\nthey should hide somewhere. And he was very, very bitter. And when he was in Holland later,\nhe took the hotel over. We went out of the hotel, and he took the hotel over. And when there\ncame Germans in the hotel, he didn\u2019t want have any Germans in the hotel; and throw them out,\nout of the hotel. So he get a lot of problems with the police; when officially it\u2019s a public place\nand you\u2019re not allowed to discriminate people. And so he had a lot of problems that, so he, he\nwas very unhappy to be in the hotel. And he sold the hotel and went to Canada. That was, I\nthink, was one of the reasons he went to Canada. He was very unhappy person; very unhappy\nman; and, I think, because of the war. He felt very guilt feeling. And he died when he was 62\nyears in a heart attack, and he didn\u2019t want to live; he didn\u2019t took care of his health. He smoked a\nlot \u2014 three packs of cigarettes a day; and drank coffee a lot. I think he didn\u2019t want to live; he\ndied really young.\nThat\u2019s a shame.\nYeah; it was a shame. He was very nice guy; I liked him very much.\nWell, thank you very much.\nHe had four wonderful children; they grow up wonderful. So he did a very good job in bringing\nup the kids.\nVery nice. Thank you.\nYou\u2019re welcome.",
