        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Farkas-Marton, Barbara. I was born in, uh, Beliu--that's in Arad [NB: province],\nNorth Transylvania, Romania.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: In May 4th, 1920.",
        "Q: OK. Uh, Barbara, would you tell me, um, a little bit about uh growing up, about your family?",
        "A: We were living in Beliu until 1937. I went to elementary school in that town, lived there.\nWas a small community of Jewish families. So around thirty, thirty-five families. We had a\nsynagogue. We had a rabbi, a shochet. And the life was pretty good in that time. We have\nPurim balls, Hannakah balls, get together. Many friends. And we were uh at least fifteen,\ntwenty children. And uh on Sunday morning when we went to the rabbi's house, and they\nteach us Hebrew and brochas [NB: blessings]. And that mean...when I reach the elementary\nschool, I know to read, to pray. I know all the brochas. And the life was pretty good. Until,\nuh...",
        "Q: Excuse me. Be...before we go on, what did your father do?",
        "A: My father had a grocery store, and my mother was helping him in the store. We had a maid\nwho was taking care of the house. I mean, cleaning and uh...but not cooking, just cleaning.\nAnd working in the garden. We have a beautiful flower garden. And, uh, we had a pretty\ngood life, that time.",
        "Q: What was it like to be a Jew? Did you feel different because you were a Jew?",
        "A: No. In that time, it was...I didn't, uh, have any bad uh treatment. I mean, uh, antisemite, uh,\nexpression in the school. Nothing. Was very, very friendly situation in the school. I mean, in\nthe elementary school; and also with the Romanian people. They were our, uh, clients in the\nstore, and good relation.",
        "Q: OK. What, um...what happened?",
        "A: In, uh, 1933, we get a other store, a competition. And my husband gets bankrupt.",
        "Q: Your husband?",
        "A: My...I'm sorry. My father gets bankrupt, the store. And then after that, we open again the\nstore on my mother's name. But the situation...the economical situation get worst. And in\n1937--oh, I forgot to tell that when I finished the elementary school, the first two grades, I...I\nwas learning at home the high ...the high school classes. And a teacher was uh tutoring all\nthat...we other too children. And we went to Betu_ for exam. But on the third, fourth and\nfifth grade, I was a regular student in Beiu_. That's a bigger town than Beliu, also in Bihar\n[NB: province]. Was a very...it's a very old school, with a...with French nuns and French uh\npriests, them...the boys school. And uh I was there until uh I finished the fifth grade. Then, in\n1937, we sold the house and the store; and we moved to Oradea,\u2019 which is a big city also in\nNorth Transylvania--some seventy, seventy-five kilometers from Beliu. There we had...my\nfather bought a house, a small house; and also in that house he opened a grocery story again.\nAnd I continue my high school in Oradea. [Altiadona (ph)] was the name of the high school;\na very good, state high school--a girl's high school. Because in Romania the girls were\nseparated from boys--different uh building, different street even. And I graduated there; and I\nwas a very good student. Every...end of every year in Oradea, I was uh...I get medals;\nbecause I was a very good student. You call it premiums? Books and some medals; and I\nwas considered a very good student. And I...really I was. That means when I graduated,\nwhen I...when ...when I had the baccalaureate exam at the end; because in Romania, that you\nfinish with the high school you have to pass a other very, very difficult exam. They call it\nbaccalaureate exam. And to that exam, they came from the other cities student to the Institute\nto pass that...that exam. The commission was formed from university professors, not local.\nAnd we were to that...inscribed to that uh exam, around seventy students; and I was the third\none 1n the grade which I pass it. Very good grade. That was in May...in June 1940; and that\nwas the last graduation at Romanian schools in North Transylvania. Because on August 30\nwas the Vienna Dictatum, and in September 6th the Hungarian army entered in North\nTransylvania. That mean, uh Oradea became uh Hungary; but South Transylvania, where 1s\npart of my family was living there, there...that's Romania, and...still Romania. Because the\nHungarian had a law--uh, Numerus Nullus--for the students to enter the universities in the\nfirst year and the second year, I was not accepted to study further. I mean, to go to\nuniversity. Because I would like to, in that time and after that, very much to study further.\nBut I wasn't accepted, because of this law. And uh...then at the end of September, I went to\nthe Jewish hospital in Oradea. Was a medium-sized Jewish hospital, some one hundred beds.\nAnd I was train to work 1n the laboratory of that hospital. And then, after very short time, I\nget a job. That means I was paid. Very low salary, but I had something to do. And I was...I\nworked there until, uh, came the... the Nazis enter in Oradea in 19...I mean, in Hungary in 19\nMarch, 1940--'44. '44,",
        "Q: Can we stop at this point? Can you tell me a little bit about what Oradea was like between\n1940 when the Hungarians came in and 1944 when the Nazis came in? What was it like?",
        "A: Was...was a...a atmosphere of antisemitism. The Arrow Cross uh Party in Hungary--the\n' Also: Oradea Mare. Hungarian name: Nagyvarad. German name: Grosswardein.\nNyilaskeresztes Party they call it--start to make propaganda and wrote all kinds of graffiti on\nthe walls against the Jew. And, uh, the commun...the people, if they thought that they are\ncommunist, they were taken away. And, uh, was a very strange atmosphere. People\nwere...it...we...we heard about what happened in Poland and, uh, in Germany, about the\nKristallnacht. And, uh, we got a little bit, uh, scared, but everything happen far away from\nus. Even we saw, because we were living very close to the main railroad station in Oradea. I\nsaw long wagons with people taken from...they said they are from Ukraine. I don't know, I\ndon't think they were Jew. They were prisoners, and they take them to Germany to work.\nAnd people start...uh, tried to give them bread and water through the window. They were\nin...1n cattle wagons. But the Hungarian, uh, gendarmes didn't let ge...uh, get close to those\nwagons. That I saw, and 1 ...I hear about what's going on. We had radios, and we hear what is\nhappening; but we said, \"This can't happen to us.\u201d We very... we were very optimistic, a little\nbit. Very fool optimistic. And then when the Nazis, the Germans, occupy Hungary--really\noccupy, in 19...March 1944, that was March 19th--starting from April Ist, 1st of April, we\nwere uh wearing the David uh star on our clotheses. And I was afraid to go in downtown or\nin the streetcars without star on...on my coat--because was still uh spring, and I was wearing\nstill a coat. But I went to work. That time, I left the hospital because the hospital was\noccupied by SS. And uh Jewish girl, other friend of mine, was working in the x-ray lab. She\nalso didn't went to work for them. And also I left the hospital, because we were afraid to go\nto work for uh ...1n the presence of the SS. Maybe they wouldn't take it out either. But I left\nthe hospital, and I start to work only a few weeks at [Angelo (ph)|--was the name of that\nphoto company. And I was working their laboratory developing films and doing copies\non...and so on. And I went home always when was already dark; and I put a uh overcoat over\nuh...about my coat, that the uh... the Star of David can't be seen. But my parents didn't let me\ncontinue to work; that they were very afraid that they're going to catch me. That means, I\nstopped working at [Angelo (ph)] before the ghetto, be two weeks. Then on--that was from\nIst of April, we had the Star of David. At first May, the same year--I mean, '44, 1944--they\nstart to take people into the ghetto in Oradea. Ghetto was around the orthodox synagogue in\nOradea. That was the Jewish quarter...quartier. And in the hospital... they...the...in the\nsynagogue, they set up the hospital. And uh in the ghetto, we moved to a family who was the\nrabbi in the town of Beliu. But unfortunately, he too, after the Hungarian came to\nOradea...come North Transylvania, he want to be moved from Beliu to Oradea. And\nthey...we move in their apartment; because we stay in the one room, and they stay--only the\nold man and his wife--in the other room. And I start to work in the hospital in the ghetto;\ndoing very simple, very routine test. Because they didn't have the equipment. They don't let\nto take the equipment from the Jewish hospital to the ghetto. Just simple test: drawing blood\nand doing some urine test. Very simple test. And also they trained me to give shots, because\nthey didn't have enough nurses. And that was from 4th May. That was my birthday when\nthey took me to the ghetto. And we were there until May 26th, when start the deportation\nfrom the ghetto. I didn't want to let my parents alone; and I preferred to stay with them and\ngo with them, not with the hospital group. And that was my luck, because the people with\nthe hospital group--nurses, uh sick people, everybody, doctors--they were taken direct in\nAuschwitz to the crematorium. That at Ist of June, going to the rail station--not the main\ntrain station in Oradea, to a littlest rail station in the [Rajdio (ph)] Park--they put us in the\nwagons. Cattle wagons, very very crowded wagons. We...everyone had just a little room to\nsit down. They put a [kibla (ph)] for uh toilet. No water, no nothing...a little water daily, but\nin a half-hour it was gone. And they locked the door from outside, and the train left the\nrailroad. They told us--these were the Hungarian gendarmes who take us to the...to the...to\nthe wagons--in the way before we start to leave the ghetto, they came with a bag to each of\nus and say, \"You have to put in this bag all your jewelry.\u201d They took my earrings, my watch,\nmy ring. Everybody put his jewelry in that bag. That means the Hungarian gendarmes took\nthose jewelries, not to... Because people, uh...they hide at home, or give to somebody to keep\nthem; but even they keep earrings or uh watches. Then the wagons start and they said that\nthey will take us to north Hungary in the puszta [the Hungarian prairie] to work in ...on the\nfarms. And we...we trust them; but later on they mis...we find out that they misled us.\nBecause then we arrived in Kassa.* That was the last Hungarian north city in Hungary. After\nKassa start already...well, the...the border to Czechoslovakia, which was occupied by\nGerman in that time. And because we then...they didn't get out at Kassa, didn't let out us to\nget out from the wagon in Kassa. They...the wagon and the train went to Poland. And...in\nCzechoslovakia, and then to Poland. In that moment, everybody was very very very scared;\nbecause we find out that they misled us, that we be in no Hungary, no puszta work, no\nnothing. They took us to Poland, but we didn't know where. And we traveled...I don't know,\nfrom Monday morning 'til uh Thursday dawn--I mean, Thursday early morning--when we\narrive in...1n Auschwitz. When we arrived there, we smelled the smoke. Was dark. And\nwhen we get out from the wagons, we saw people out the doors stripped dresses...uh, coats.\nThey were Polish people, mostly. They speak Yiddish; and they said, \"You have to do\nseparate lanes...uh, lines. The men for on one side, the women on the other side.\u201d And they\ntold to the womens--they have young children on their arms, or uh beside them--they said,\n\"Give the children to the old people, old womans.\u201d We didn't...these poor womans, they\ndidn't know what means. Which mother would left their child out from their hands? And\nthen we have...there we have time to say adieu to my father, to kiss him. And then (pause -\ncrying) ...then we start to go ahead in line. I was 1n the same line (pause - crying) ...with my\nmother and with the lady what...who...whom house we were living in the ghetto. I mean, the\nrabbi wife. And we just passed a few, I don't know maybe ha...quarter of mile. Very short\nway. And we saw a big side lights on the...directed towards us, that...and on there was\nstaying a very nice looking SS man. And we find out later that man was Mengele. And\nbeside him there were some helper--people with those stripped coats; and with the...his hand\nhe pointed to people. And because I was not on his side on the line--I was the inside line--he\npointed to me, and came two men. They grabbed me and put me out from the line, on the\nright side. I didn't have time to kiss my mother, or to see...to say something to her. I was\nterrible shock. And after that we find out that the people, they... I mean, the women, they...\nAll the people--I mean, my mother and all the others-- they then direct to the crematorium.\n* Hungarian name for city currently located in Czechoslovakia. Czech name: Ko%ice (German\nname: Kaschau). Located in an area which originally belonged to Hungary, but was made part of\nCzechoslovakia in 1918; occupied by Hungary from 1938 to 1945, but returned to Czechoslovakia\nafter the war ended.\nAnd they...when we were around one uh hundred or maybe more on the right side, they take\nus to the bath. We left all our clotheses on the floor. They cut our hair from all our body; and\nwe get a shower. We...you know? We...and then, with[out] any towel or anything, just that's\nhow we were, they give us a very very strange looking dress: long, short, terrible-looking.\nAnd some also very bad shoes; and they put us immediately, still wet, outside in the... in the\nyard. Outside the wash building. And there, from far away, were the mens also; because we\nsaw people with those stripped coats. And up today, I think--and maybe was just imagining--\nthat I saw my father between them. But I have...I was not sure. Then from there after a while,\nafter waiting outside maybe one hour, two hours--I don't remember exactly how long time --\nwe marched to the C Lager. And they put us in the Block 15. There was nothing. Just some\nuh straw on the floor. And, uh, the Blockalteste who was a Slovak--I mean, the Jewish girl\nfrom Slovakia--that was the Blockalteste. I mean, the boss over us. And she has some\nStubdienst--I mean, some helper--also Slovakian, because they spoke German. These people,\nthey were...they have some, uh, position. I mean, Blockalteste or Stubdienst were, uh,\nchoosed by the SS because they spoke...spake, uh, German, or a little bit Yiddish. They\nunderstood German. And those Blockaltestes, they're very very bad people. They start to\nscream to us, \"Why you came...let them to take you here? You know they are...they want to\nput you in the crematorium. Your parents are on the smoke.\u201d Uh, terrible things they\ntalk...talk. Everybody was in shock--crying, screaming. We didn't know...up to that moment,\nwe didn't know anything what's going on. And many people, they lost their consciousness\nand they get their prayers.... Terrible situation happen in the block. Crying, screaming.\nMany, uh, some of them went to the...to the fence, touched the wire. Get, uh...and they die,\nbecause they were with electricity. Very, very terrible situation happens. Then...we were\nsleeping on the floor, on that straw. And...and the night was pretty cold, because in--I don't\nknow what kind of climate-- maybe because we had only one cloth on...one dress on us. In\nearly morning in dark, they took us outside from the block to say the \"Appell\"--counting us.\nSitting five in a row or, uh, sometimes more, and they count and they count us hundred\ntimes, \u2018cause they knew how many should be. And the many times they made mistakes, and\nagain count. And we stood out on that terrible.... I mean, was cold in the early morning.\nVery, very, uh, tight to each other; and finally when the SS, uh, woman came and recount us,\nsome of us, they fell down or sit down because they couldn't stay. She start to beat that...that\nperson in the face. And was...was a...was a terrible, uh, way to...to stay at say the \"Appell.\u201d\nAnd this say the \"Appell\" again was afternoon. That means, was very warm. The sun was\nvery...very warm, that people were fainting from the warm...uh, from the warm. In the\nmorning, was very cold. In afternoon, late afternoon was very cold...very hot. Finally when\nwe get in the block, we get in a big bowl some kind of food: some soup--sometimes with a\npiece of...of, uh, potato in, sometimes just fluid. And we passed that bowl around five, six\npeople; and we were counting how many sips each one did. And save God if somebody\ndid...took more sips than, uh, uh, we were, uh, agreed to take each one. And we get a piece of\nbread--was all as ...as black, almost black and strong like a...like a stone. But we were very,\nvery hungry, and we eat every.... Somebody, some people couldn't eat; and those people they\ncouldn't eat, or [NB: either] they were very fancy or, uh, they didn't like it. They didn't\nrealize that is for survival. They die for famine. And uh the food had some kind of smell,\n[cabron (ph)]. There, after that, we found out that they put some bromide in the food to make\nthat the woman don't have the period. And I didn't have the period more that one year. And\nuh that was starting from June Ist. Then...I was eating, forcing myself to eat everything. The\nbread. Sometimes they give us a little little piece of margarine, or a little bit of piece of\nwurst--I mean, uh, cold cut. But very little. In--I don't know exactly--in July, they came and\nask us who wants to help to take some container to the other side, to the other, uh, lager--to\nthe B Lager. Because the kitchen was in C Lager. And those girls or women who get to work\nin the kitchen, they had a good life. I mean, they have enough food. And I went and I said, \"I\nwant to...to work, to take those container to the B Lager.\u201d Because they said, \"You will get a\nlittle bit more food when you finish with that work.\u201d And because I was hungry, I said I\npreferred to go and held those heavy containers and get a little food. And they took us...they\ntake us very early, in dark in the morning, to take out those containers to the B Lager. And\nwe...we passed through the main gate of C Lager, and that then we pass through the B gate\nof the ...of the B Lager, the gate of the B Lager. Once happen that uh the two of girls who\nwere coming on back of my side push us, touch our container. And the food was not\ncovered--I mean, the container was not covered. And a little bit of food spill out from the\ncontainer; and the SS uh woman saw this, and they punish both of us. We put down the\ncontainer aside, and they take us to the C Lager gate, and said to us to kneel. And we took\nbricks, bricks in our hands. We held up our hands with the bricks, and stayed there from\nthe...from dawn until the sun was...I think was already noon. And we were very afraid with\nthe other girl, because we...in that time, we know already about crematorium. And we were\nafraid that maybe as a punishment they going to take us to the crematorium. But uh at noon,\nthey let us go back to the block. And during that time when we were staying kneeling with\nthe bricks on our hands, we were uh heard from far...from far away their music bands\nplaying \"The Merry Widow.\u201d And we were crying and crying (crying), listening to that\nmusic; because I knew that uh music from my home, from before. And then finally at noon\nthey let us go back to the to the block, and we were happy that we escaped and they didn't\ntake us to the crematorium. And since then, I never went to carry those uh container. Even\nwhen I was very hungry, I was very afraid of something happen and that's the end. In\nAugust, came...they announce in the block that those people they were working in before--I\nmean, in their homes, in laboratory, in photography, as uh seam...as uh tailors--that means\nthey have fine hands, fine fingers. They go aside, and they choose us. I don't know how\nmany we were in our block. Maybe twenty-five, thirty. They take us to the Lager, the Block\nnumber 10. And there were also girls from other uh blocks from the C Lager, also in the\nsame category. After a while--maybe one week, ten days later--came a commission... I mean,\ntwo civil wearing.... I mean, not SS. Two men, and uh two SS men; and we had to pass in\nfront. They took in a...1n a room where on the wall there were a sign like in a ophthalmology\noffice. And we, they put us to read the numbers, to what...and they were looking how our\neyes are good or not. I mean, what line, lower line you can read. And also they touch our\nfingers. And uh I was choosen to go with that group, but I don't know where. We didn't\nknow where, whats means that. And they choose three hundred of us. Only three hundred.\nThey take us to B Lager in a block. Empty block. That means, only we were there. They say\nthat they going to keep us in quarantine for...I don't, I think three weeks. To see if somebody\ngets sick or some contagious illness. Unfortunately, one of the girls get sick; and they said\nthat she has typhus. I don't know if it's true or not, but they keep us, I think, two...uh ten days\nmore, to see if other girls get sick or not. But nobody gets sick; and I don't think she had\ntyphus. Just a diarrhea, or something [like] that. We don't...didn't have doctors there, just uh\nuh nurses; or there wasn't a good diagnostic to say that is typhus or not. Anyway, after...1n\nthe...after the quarantine was over, in the end of September, they put us in a wagon, in a\ntruck. They take us to the wash...I mean, to the shower room in Auschwitz. We were afraid\nto go...always we were afraid to go to shower, because in the shower happened that they let\nthe gas come out 1n...instead of water, they said. I don't know, but they said that that was the\nway how they did it. We...we get a shower there, and we get pretty good dre...clotheses.\nUnderwear, better dress, coat, better shoes, some uh stockings. That was something uh batik\n[NB: a scarf] on the...1n the head. We...we feel pretty ba...good, because we we didn't have\nlice in that time. But uh we very much afraid of lice. During the Auschwitz stage, I passed\ntwo times through a selection. There came doctors from uh...I don't know from where, SS\ndoctor; and we...we...naked, we shoot past in front of them. And if somebody have some\nlittle uh sign on his...on his uh body, this for put on the left. And they took them to the\ncrematorium. Was terrible selection, because they were afraid that the whole Lager B is\ngoing to have typhus or some kind of contagious diseases. And they do this...I was passing\ntwo times this kind of selection; but thanks God, I didn't have any thing on my body and I...I\ngo through. Now after we had that better clothes, we...they take us in a wagon. Not... not\ncattle wagon; a better wagon. Was not dirty, was pretty good. And they take us to\nWeifwasser.\u201d Was a place that the telephone ca...company had a big factory of air plane\nlamps. My factory was very close to Breslau [NB: Wroc_aw]. And there we have three\nbarracks. Each one of us, we had individual beds; uh, some, uh...some, uh, beds...not bed\nsheets, but uh blankets. Was uh was aa brick oven there. That means, in the winter we had\nsome brick, and we...we...we stay in warm room. And from there we were walking every\nmorning to the factory, under the supervision of the SS woman. And, uh, we worked eight\nhours, and at night we came home. I was working first in the chemistry lab, because I was\nregistered as a laboratory technician. But then they put me to...after a short while they\ntransfer me to the Cathode Abteilung [NB: Cathode Workshop]. That means I did the\ncathode part of the...of those lamps. Very fine, very little pieces, with, uh, four chips\nworking, uh...very, very fine. Very small, and very fine job. All day with the lights on those\ncathodes; and with some machine, I pinch each one and put something on the end. Anyway,\nwas very...a good situation there; because we was warm in the la...in the factory. That means,\nwe were not feeling the winter. Was already winter. The food was not too much; but, uh, we\nhad a nurse 1n the...in that, uh, barracks, was a part of barracks was the infirmary. There\nsomebody if he has something, uh, sick or, uh, cold or diarrhea was taken there; and the\nnurse was a Jewish girl was taking care. But they didn't keep...keep us too long in the\ninfirmary, because they were also afraid that they going to take us to crema[torium]. Because\nthey say that GroB Rosen--or I don't know which camp--was not far from there. And I\n* Subcamp of GroB Rosen. There were actually two subcamps with this name, one located at Kreis\nRothenberg in Lower Silesia and the other at Kreis Hohenstadt in the Sudetenland. The camp in\nSudetenland is where Firma Telefunken had its facility. The camp in Lower Silesia had a\nglassworks. It was evacuated in February 1945.\nremember I was one time I was very very hungry and very very very weak. I went to the\nfactory. I work, but I feel very weak. And the nurse was a very good person. I still...a long\ntime I keep in touch with her. She remain in Sweden. She married a Swedish man. And we\n...when we...when I was in the infirmary, she gave me extra food; and I get it, little bit, I feel\nmuch better after uh three, four days. And also she told me to came...after they divided the\nfood to everybody, to came to the infirmary. And she gave me a little extra food. She was a\nvery good person. She gave extra food to those girls they were a little bit...know a little bit\nthey were weaker. And I was between those. Then, at end of February--we were there from\nOctober [1944] 'til end of February [1945 ]--during the night we start to hear all kind of\nnoises; airplane and shooting. And they said that the Russia are starting to clo...to get closer\nand closer. And they evacuate the...that... those barracks, and they put us on feet to walk. I\ndon't remember exact the place where they took us--other Lager. And there also were a good\nnumber of people. They took those people, too; attached to our group, go further. Like a\nsnowball; at the end, we were a lot of people. I don't know how many--thousand, maybe.\nAnd from that date--from Feb...end of February until end of April, that means March--two\nmonths, more than two months, we were all the time going from here to there by foot, by\ntrain...uh getting out from the train, on the camp. And eating green leaves, and no water. And\nthen we start to get a lot, a lot of lice; because we didn't have water to drink nor to wash\nourselfs. And already was uh...at one night we were in wagon and the wagon was lock up.\nOne night we heard the SS men outside talking, of the wagon, \"Our Fuhrer is dead.\"-- \"Alter\nist tot,\" he said. And we...we just were listening, and we di.. we didn't know which Fuhrer;\nbecause was a Fuhrer of the camp, and was the Fuhrer Hitler. And then after that--that was\naround end of April...23, 24th April. Something like that; we didn't know exactly. I just\nglad said these, uh...find out this date. After a while, they...we were very close to\nDenmark, we find out; to the Denmark border. They put us...they take us from the wagon,\nand they set us in lane on that camp. And around us they set up some cannons, you know?\nAnd we were very, very afraid that they going to kill us. You know, I don't know how you\ncall those, which uh...Katushka* or something, they kill in line people. We say, \"Now, this is\nthe end!\" But after short time, maybe half hour, we saw an airplane flying very low. And\nthen gear down, landed not far from that point. Pass maybe one hour, two hours. They said,\n\"Get up, go back to the wagon.\u201d We didn't know what happened. Then we were sitting 1n the\nwagon; and in that moment, the SS was change to the Wehrmacht. People came...I mean,\nWehrmacht soldiers came to take over the wagons. And they were sit...they opened the door,\nand we were sitting on the floor with the legs outside, clinging outside from the wagon. And\nhe said--I remember I was very close to the door--and he said, \"Yah, you're going to go to\nthe good places. What...I don't know what going to happen to us.\u201d\u2019 And we passed through\nvery nice places, very nice uh towns and very nice places we go ...we went with the wagons\nthrough. And we didn't know what were going on. After a short while the train stop, they\nopen large the doors; and we saw... I was not in the first wagon. I was mostly in the middlest\npart of the wagon, but was a very long train. I find out later that we...that mean, we were four\nthousand. And during this uh going and coming, many times we... we observe that in the\n* NB: Katusha rockets, or perhaps reference is to machine guns (such as Kalashnikov rifle).\nmorning we are in the same place, circling around. And during the night, we heard many\nshootings; because they said that men started to try to escape. Anyway, when uh they opened\nthe doors, we look out and we saw nurses with white dresses and caps with red cross on their\nfront head. And...on the caps. And uh when they arrived to our wagon, there were two or\nthree civilian...two or three nurses and the Wehrmacht people. Maybe one Wehrmacht\nperson. And a man said to us, \"You are free now, and you going to stay overnight here.\u201d\nYah, they said that we are in the border with Denmark, at Padborg. That was a town or city.\nWe were not in the city; we...they take us to a farm during the ni...over the night. They said,\n\"You are now in the border of Denmark and uh...and uh Germany; and tomorrow you will\ngo to Sweden. You stay here overnight, and you are now free people.\u201d Everybody start to\ncry, to scream: \"Where is my mother? Where is my sister? Where is my father?\" We were\nin terrible shock. We didn't know what to...what to...what to think. Then came the Red Cross\ncars at every wagon, and they put us in those wagons, take us to the...to a very close farm.\nAnd so full with lice; they didn't uh disinfect us. They put us to a table, and they give us to\neat uh oatmeal with a little milk. Not too much milk. And naturally, we eat like wolves. We\nvery hungry; and they said that they don't give us too much food, because they don't want\nafter that big starving to eat too much. Because will not be good for us. And uh they give us\nsome, uh, sleep bags. And, uh, in a barn, a covered barn, we stayed there. We sleep in those\nsleeping bags over night. What was interesting in that barn, that in our...that group there were\nalso Kapos, Jewish Kapos, and the Blockaltestes and Stubdienstes. They were strong. You\ncan see from that picture, the last picture of mine, not everybody was skinny. Those, uh,\ngood looking girls, they were Stubdienst or...or Blockaltestes. They were eating well, from\nour food. Some strong--stronger, not too very strong--people are start to beat them well with\nsome sticks, start to...to beat them. But, uh, even they arrested one of them, one of the Kapos.\nBecause the girls start to scream that he was a Kapo, he was a devil; and they arrested that\nperson. In the morning, they took us to the railroad--so full with lice, with the same clotheses\non us...on us. And, uh, they put us in some wagons, first class wagon. All, everything was in,\nuh, velvet. You can't imagine. We are so...feel so bad, too, with those lice and dirty how we\nwere, to sleep on those velvet, uh, seats. And they...I don't know, they...where they took us,\nto Copenhagen or where. And then we ...",

        "Q: OK. We're on? Are we? We're on. OK. You've arrived in a city, which the train took you\nwhere...",
        "A: To take us, they...the cit...the train took us to the port. And they, we took a sh...they put us in\na ship. And we went to Malmo in Sweden. The ship debark in Malm6--that's the southern uh\nport of Sweden. In Malm6, also they put us in some uh Red Cross trucks. And they take us in\na forest; some military camp was there somehow, because there were tents. And that... there,\nthey disinfected us. They took...take all our clotheses. They look over our body...body. They\nwash us. Two persons wash us on a...on a bed--you know, a rubber bed. Because we have...I\nhave, I was so skinny that I couldn't wash myself. And uh because I have so many lice uh\npinches on my skin, the doctor thought that I have scabies. And they put a note on my wrist--\n\"Scabies.\u201d And I said, \"I'm sorry, it's not scabies.\u201d Because I know that scabies is itching,\nand I didn't feel any itching. And I said, \"These are lice pinches.\u201d Anyway, they put some uh\nsol...solution on my body. They wash it. They put some DD...DDT on my hair, because my\nhair uh where I had a little hair on uh... They put the DDT on my head. They made a turban\nwith a towel. And they give us very nice clotheses--a coat, nice shoes. Everything new. And\nfrom there we went to Landskrona, where in a school they set up a quarantine from us...for\nus. We get some uh sleep bags, and where we...we were uh sleeping on those sleep... uh\nsleep bags on the floor in...in the classes. The second day after we arrived there,\nthey...everyone was taken to x-ray, to a medical center or some...I don't know. Was a\nhospital, I think. They made x-ray on everyone. They check us; a very long medical check-\nup. They didn't took any blood. Just physically they check us: the eyes, the throat,\neverything. And then, who they find out they are sick--something on the lung, or they find\nsomething wrong--immediately they take them to the hospital. I didn't have anything wrong.\nI mean, just I was very very skinny. I had sixty pounds--thirty kilos. I was almost bone\nand...and skin. But in the quarantine, we had very very good food. I mean, very dietetic food\nthat didn't hurt. Nobody get diarrhea or stomach pain. Very, very careful given...uh, they\ngive us very careful, uh, dieting food, that after, uh, ten days everybody get a lot of pounds.\nAnd I don't know how many pounds I get, but I feel much stronger. And in this time, start to\ncome every day, uh, Jewish woman [NB: women], some... I don't know what was the name\nof the Jewish association of that...those women. They came to visit us, and ask about our\nfamily; and everybody was asking, \"How I can find out about my family--my parents, my\nsister, my husband?\" And they take the addresses and, uh, try to to find the list, what they\nfind in the...at the Nazis. Because they have lists. For example, our group--the three hundred\npeople--they find the group a telephone can with our names. I found this out not that time,\nbut later on. And, uh, that was May 4th when we arrive in Sweden. At May 7 was the end of\nthe war; and was a big procession in the street with flags, with uh...with uh... How you call?\nUh, Christian, uh, reverends, or...1n their, uh...",
        "Q: The priests in their robes?",
        "A: ..1n their, uh, church robes, with, uh, lights, with, uh... How you call those? Uh... Saw\nlighting in the hand...",
        "Q: Torches?",
        "A: Torches, yah. With torches. They parading 1n the street for the Peace Day. We find...they\nsaid that the...the war is over. And they stop in front of the...of the school--that was the\nschool then where we in, uh, staying. And they star...start to cheer us. Everybody was crying.\n(Crying) And then during that time already, we find out that North Transylvania became\nagain Romania. And we were from Romania--I mean, from North Transylvania--from\nHungary, from uh the...all part of Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland. All kinds of\npeople we were there. And the consulates from these countries came to visit us, and make\nthe list. And because I was from...taken from Oradea, they said, \"Oradea now is Romanian;\nyou belong to Romania now.\u201d And they give us...I don't know, very little of money; and they\nsaid to write letters if we have some relatives in South Transylvania. Because they knew that\nin North Transylvania, no Jewish relatives survive. And I knew the address of my uncle in\nArad, who was South Transylvania; but I miss the address with one number. I put 34\n[Nikoufilipescou (ph)]| Street instead of 32 [Filipesc... (ph)]; and he never get the letter.\nBecause the 32 was a dormitory of uh...I don't know which school, and they never get the\nletter. That means, from May I didn't get any answers. Nothing. I was very very...feeling\nvery very alone, and very so lonely; because other girls, they get immediately telegrams and\nuh news by telephone to the embassy that uh they were happy that they are alive, so on. I\ndidn't get anything. And then from there, after the quarantine was over, they take the\nRomanian woman from the quarantine to a place near Stockholm. I don't remember the\nname. There, we were only girls and womans from... from Romania. I mean, from North\nTransylvania; because all the Romania was not deported. And uh we were very well treated\nthere: food, and we get other clotheses. And from Stockholm, ...we were...1t was very close\nto Stockholm, that place. There were some villas on the seashore; very nice place. And uh\nwe had movies; and uh the Jewish ladies--I don't know exactly, I don't remember the\nassociation of those ladies--they came. They took us to Stockholm, to visit...to see\nStockholm. And they take care of us very closely. Very...very nicely. And we start to...to\nregain our...our uh lost pounds. And uh after a while, when we feel ex...not strong, we...we\nfeel boring [NB: bored] there. Because we didn't have what to do all day; just talking all the\ntime about the lager, about our life before, and.... We didn't ha...do anything, just waiting\nwhat going to happen. And once... after a while, we find out that we can go to work. And I\nget very friendly with three sisters. They, three of them, they get ...they survive. The older\nwas a seam... How you say it? She made uh clotheses...",
        "Q: Seamstress.",
        "A: Seamstress, yah. The older--the younger, the middle one and the younger, they had no any\nskill. Myself, also; because we were just graduated from high school. And we said,\n\"What...what to do? How...what to work? What work we can take?\" And this older sister\nsaid... She left her girl in Budapest at the Red Cross; and she find out, until that time then we\nwere in that place, that her si...her little girl survive. And she was so happy, and...but she\ncan't get home immediately. Anyway, she said, \"Come with me to work as uh...in a\nconfection factory. And you have to say that uh you work in the past--a little lie--to work, to\nbe together, to don't separate us.\u201d And they...they... we went to Orebro. It's a pretty big city,\nwest of Stockholm. Not very far from Stockholm; maybe, I don't know, one hundred and\nfifty miles from Stockholm. A very very nice old city; and there was a confection factory by\nname [Tulene's (ph)]. They did uh suits for men and coats, for men and womans too. And we\nstart to work there. They...you know, the work in factory goes in line. We did all the...all day\nthe same thing. Uh sewing the line of around the hems, in...1n the vest of the...of the suits.\nThat means, uh was a very nice place. The daughter of the owner find us a nice apartment\nwith two bedrooms; and we stay in the same apartment and went to work. Very close was\nthe work place, in downtown Orebro.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there?",
        "A: We stayed there...I stayed there--my friends, they went home earlier than me, because they\nlet go home first those people they find their closest relatives. I mean, the oldest--by name\nBlanca--she finds her daughter. She was the first. She went home. The middle one had uh get\ntelegram from her fianc\u00e9, who came from Ru...from uh Russia. I mean, from the forced camp\nlabor. The youngest one, they didn't want to separate them, they went together home first.\nThat mean, I was left alone. And I feel very bad; plus, I didn't know anything about my\nfamily. Finally, around Christmas, somebody gave me the idea... Because I know for sure\nthat my uncle is alive in Arad. I was thinking maybe they changed apartments or new\naddress, but I didn't know that. And somebody told me, \"Write a let...a telegram, send a\ntelegram to the Jewish community in Arad. Give their name, his wife name, his son name,\napproximately their age. And maybe they knew them, and they will answer you.\u201d And I did\nthat. And after very short time, maybe ten days, I get answer from them. From my uncle,\nsaying in the telegram, \"Came home! We...we wait you with open arms.\u201d And I was very\nvery happy that finally I get in touch with them. We start to write to each other; but that was\nChristmas '45. But I can't...couldn't go home until '46 in September. All that time, I was\nworking at [Tulene's (ph)]. I getting friendly with other girls; because in that factory, there\nother girls from other groups also taken from uh Germany camps. And we get friendly with\nthe..I get friendly with them; and uh we went to each other. We get in to movies. We have a\npretty good life there. The Swedish people were very, very nice to us. They invited to their\nhouses. But we didn't speak so well; very very little we speak Swedish. And when we start to\nspeak a little bit better, they still invited us; but we didn't felt good to go up to go to their\nhome. Because they all the time they were...they were asking us about how it was in the\ncamps, in the lager; and we were so...feel so bad that we didn't want to talk anymore about\n[it]. And finally in September, ...because I write...wrote a letter to the Romanian embassy\nthat I want to go to university and if I don't go uh sooner I will miss the scholar...the starting\nof the...the school year. Finally they send me...send me home in September. The coming\nhome was a torture; because we --together with other girls from other group--seventy of us,\nwe came by plane 'til Prague. Was exactly between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. That\nmeans, we spent the holidays there in Prague, in a hotel uh supported by Joint. Forty people,\nthey were going to America, to other countries. And when we said that we came from\nSweden and we go home to Romania. They said, \"You are crazy. You go back. We just go\nuh...leave Romania, and go to...\u201d And we were a little disappointed, but was no way to turn\nback. Finally, the Romanian embassy in Prague took--I don't know how many--fifteen or\ntwenty former war prisoner--Romanian, non-Jewish war prisoner. They were prisoner in the\nwest. I don't know by the Germans or by who. And they came together with us. We had a\ncommon...together the same visa, the enter visa to Romania--those prisoners and seventeen\nof us. They were very good people. I mean, uh they help us very much; because we be... we\nhad heavy luggages, you know? And they help us to carry those luggages. They...we give\nthem cigarettes and uh chocolate we have. And uh we pass from uh Prague to Budapest in a\nwagon full with uh wood. In the front of wood trains, where are the longer bars 1s a little\nplace. We were staying there until we passed the...the border. When we arrived in Hungary--\nI don't remember the name of that town--was a Sunday afternoon, and the peasants were\nstaying in. You know, 1n the...in the country, the peasants go to the railroad station to see\nwho is coming, who is going. And they were then, when they sawed us and they asked,\n\"Who are you?\" We said that we are uh coming back from the lagers, and so on. And they\nsaid--you know what they said. That was the first first disappointment of ours. They said,\n\"Oh, they come more people back than uh they left.\u201d And then from there, we went to\nBudapest; and from Budapest, again by very strange way, we went to Arad. Because Arad is\non the border between Romania and Hungary. And at the border of Romanian...Romanian\nuh...last Hungarian station and between the Romanian station, was a big trouble. The former\nprisoner, they have some blankets; and they said that those blankets are stealed, I don't from\nwhere stolen from. And they had a big discussion, and almost they fight. We were very\nscared, because that station was full with Russia soldiers. And the Russia soldiers that time,\nthey're taking everything what they can from the people and rape the women, and so on. And\nwe were very very scared in that little station, because they didn't let the train to pass to\nRomania. They stopped it; because they said that those uh prisoners, they have stealen some\nblankets. I don't know from where they said from them. I don't remember exactly. But we\nwere staying there overnight. Very scary. Then finally, we went though. We arrive in Curtici\n(Hung: Kiirtos]. That's the border, uh first stop in Romania. And uh from there...there I\nfind... Naturally, they... all of us went out from the train, and they start to look in our\nluggages. To control the... How you say? The...",

        "A: Immigration.",
        "Q: We need to move on a bit. Uh, you went from there back to Arad finally?",
        "A: [...my...I sent a note with somebody who says he goes to Arad to my uncle. That \"I am here,\nand please come to see me, take me from here.\u201d Because we...we stood there more...more\nthan a half day. They look in the baggage for... What is it? The Custom[s]. And my uncle\ncame with my...his son to Curtici, and we met there. And uh he came with a car. I don't\nknow, was not his car. He didn't have car. And they took me home, to his...to Arad.",
        "Q: How long did you stay...did you live in Arad?",
        "A: After the holiday--was after Yom Kippur, because was the Yom Kippur coming--I said to\nmy uncle, \"Look, I came home because I want to go to study. I can stay in Sweden, but I\ndidn't want to be a a confection worker all my life in a confection factory. I want to study.\u201d\nAnd uh he said, \"You can go to Cluj.\u201d\u2019 Cluj is the biggest uh city, university city, in\nTransylvania. Has a very old university, very famous university; and I went to Cluj and I get\nfirst grade at uh... How you say? Uh, I mean I didn't pay any tuition, any...",

        "A: Yeah. I was in...in Cluj, I stood [NB: stayed] two years in a Jewish dormitory, supported by\nJoint. The name was [Anton Mark (ph)]. He was a famous mathematician, director of the\nJewish school in Cluj; and the dormitory and the canteen get the name of this very famous\nman. He die in the deportation. After two years, the...all the private dormitory were\nnationalized; and I went to live in a dormitory with other Romanian girls together. Was very\nnice. Was not any anti-Semitism. Was...was a good place. And I studied in Cluj until from\n'46 till '51; and I graduated as a industrial pharmacist, majoring 1n indus...industrial\npharmacy and minoring in bio-chemistry. That was '51. In 19...1n vacation I used to go home\nto my...to Arad, to my uncle. He send me money for the railroad, and I went home to their\nhome...uh house in vacations. And I met my husband in that time. In 1950, we get married;\nand one year we were separated. I mean, I was finishing the last year in Cluj and he was in\nArad. When I finished...I graduated from university, they were asking of everybody in that\ntime where you want to work. And because my husband had a good job in Arad, I said--and\nbecause in Arad was not any pharmaceutical factory--they said, \"You should work as a bio-\nchemist in a hospital laboratory.\u201d And I choose that, and I accepted. And I went to Arad in\n'51, and I get a job there. I get the job. They was something official. You know, in Romania\nat that time you didn't have to look for job. They sent you to the fixed job. And I started to\nwork there, and I work there until 1961. This time, we ask for immigration. Right in the\nbeginning. In uh '51, we ask...then start to...people to ask for immigration to Israel. We asked\nalso; we fill out all the papers, a long questionnaire, to go to Israel. We waited from '51 \u2018til\n'61 to get to Israel. And when we left Romania, we didn't left with a visa to Israel; because in\nthat time they didn't let people to go to Israel, because they were very friendly with the\nArabs. And how to cheat them, people were asking to emigrate to other country but they turn\nin Vienna to Israel. And because two of my friends get married in Sweden to Swedish uh\nmen, I...I wrote to them to send me a letter that I am their relative. In a very, very, very...in a\nvery very strange way I sent that letter; because they...they censored the letters. Somebody\nwent to Israel, and I told her their address and she wrote to thems. Very very difficult way.\nAnd she send me a letter, and with that letter we went to Swedish embassad [NB: embassy].\nThey give us a visa, and we get out from Romania with visa to Sweden. But when we arrive\nin Vienna, we turn and we get into Israel.",
        "Q: You lived...you lived in Israel for how long before you came to the States?",
        "A: We live in Israel from January 9...uh 19 '62 until uh February 12th--Lincoln's birthday, I\nremember exactly--19...uh 1968. That means, seven years. Yah. In Israel, uh we were... they\nput us in Afula, in some [sfrifim (ph) |--[academaim sfrifim (ph)], they call it. I get the job\nimmediately in the first week to work in the Afula Hospital laboratory. That was uh one of\nthe first hospitals in Israel, from the Englishman that time. My husband, being a... They said\nthat you don't need to speak Hebrew, because in the lab they had Hungarian and Romanian\npeople and you can understand each other and do the job. And really, was that way. My\nhusband being an accountant, they put him in a ulpan in Haifa; and every Friday afternoon\nhe came to Afula, which was very close. Forty minutes, by bus. And after he finished, he\ncan't get a job in Afula. And uh he get a job in Jerusalem. Some friends of our was living\nthere. They have a bakery factory, and they give him a job. And very difficult way, I get a\ntransfer from Afula to Jerusalem.",

        "A: My name is Farkas-Marton, Barbara. I was born in, uh, Beliu--that's in Arad [NB: province],\nNorth Transylvania, Romania.",
        "A: In May 4th, 1920.",
        "A: We were living in Beliu until 1937. I went to elementary school in that town, lived there.\nWas a small community of Jewish families. So around thirty, thirty-five families. We had a\nsynagogue. We had a rabbi, a shochet. And the life was pretty good in that time. We have\nPurim balls, Hannakah balls, get together. Many friends. And we were uh at least fifteen,\ntwenty children. And uh on Sunday morning when we went to the rabbi's house, and they\nteach us Hebrew and brochas [NB: blessings]. And that mean...when I reach the elementary\nschool, I know to read, to pray. I know all the brochas. And the life was pretty good. Until,\nuh...",
        "A: My father had a grocery store, and my mother was helping him in the store. We had a maid\nwho was taking care of the house. I mean, cleaning and uh...but not cooking, just cleaning.\nAnd working in the garden. We have a beautiful flower garden. And, uh, we had a pretty\ngood life, that time.",
        "A: No. In that time, it was...I didn't, uh, have any bad uh treatment. I mean, uh, antisemite, uh,\nexpression in the school. Nothing. Was very, very friendly situation in the school. I mean, in\nthe elementary school; and also with the Romanian people. They were our, uh, clients in the\nstore, and good relation.",
        "A: In, uh, 1933, we get a other store, a competition. And my husband gets bankrupt.",
        "A: My...I'm sorry. My father gets bankrupt, the store. And then after that, we open again the\nstore on my mother's name. But the situation...the economical situation get worst. And in\n1937--oh, I forgot to tell that when I finished the elementary school, the first two grades, I...I\nwas learning at home the high ...the high school classes. And a teacher was uh tutoring all\nthat...we other too children. And we went to Betu_ for exam. But on the third, fourth and\nfifth grade, I was a regular student in Beiu_. That's a bigger town than Beliu, also in Bihar\n[NB: province]. Was a very...it's a very old school, with a...with French nuns and French uh\npriests, them...the boys school. And uh I was there until uh I finished the fifth grade. Then, in\n1937, we sold the house and the store; and we moved to Oradea,\u2019 which is a big city also in\nNorth Transylvania--some seventy, seventy-five kilometers from Beliu. There we had...my\nfather bought a house, a small house; and also in that house he opened a grocery story again.\nAnd I continue my high school in Oradea. [Altiadona (ph)] was the name of the high school;\na very good, state high school--a girl's high school. Because in Romania the girls were\nseparated from boys--different uh building, different street even. And I graduated there; and I\nwas a very good student. Every...end of every year in Oradea, I was uh...I get medals;\nbecause I was a very good student. You call it premiums? Books and some medals; and I\nwas considered a very good student. And I...really I was. That means when I graduated,\nwhen I...when ...when I had the baccalaureate exam at the end; because in Romania, that you\nfinish with the high school you have to pass a other very, very difficult exam. They call it\nbaccalaureate exam. And to that exam, they came from the other cities student to the Institute\nto pass that...that exam. The commission was formed from university professors, not local.\nAnd we were to that...inscribed to that uh exam, around seventy students; and I was the third\none 1n the grade which I pass it. Very good grade. That was in May...in June 1940; and that\nwas the last graduation at Romanian schools in North Transylvania. Because on August 30\nwas the Vienna Dictatum, and in September 6th the Hungarian army entered in North\nTransylvania. That mean, uh Oradea became uh Hungary; but South Transylvania, where 1s\npart of my family was living there, there...that's Romania, and...still Romania. Because the\nHungarian had a law--uh, Numerus Nullus--for the students to enter the universities in the\nfirst year and the second year, I was not accepted to study further. I mean, to go to\nuniversity. Because I would like to, in that time and after that, very much to study further.\nBut I wasn't accepted, because of this law. And uh...then at the end of September, I went to\nthe Jewish hospital in Oradea. Was a medium-sized Jewish hospital, some one hundred beds.\nAnd I was train to work 1n the laboratory of that hospital. And then, after very short time, I\nget a job. That means I was paid. Very low salary, but I had something to do. And I was...I\nworked there until, uh, came the... the Nazis enter in Oradea in 19...I mean, in Hungary in 19\nMarch, 1940--'44. '44,",
        "A: Was...was a...a atmosphere of antisemitism. The Arrow Cross uh Party in Hungary--the\n' Also: Oradea Mare. Hungarian name: Nagyvarad. German name: Grosswardein.\nNyilaskeresztes Party they call it--start to make propaganda and wrote all kinds of graffiti on\nthe walls against the Jew. And, uh, the commun...the people, if they thought that they are\ncommunist, they were taken away. And, uh, was a very strange atmosphere. People\nwere...it...we...we heard about what happened in Poland and, uh, in Germany, about the\nKristallnacht. And, uh, we got a little bit, uh, scared, but everything happen far away from\nus. Even we saw, because we were living very close to the main railroad station in Oradea. I\nsaw long wagons with people taken from...they said they are from Ukraine. I don't know, I\ndon't think they were Jew. They were prisoners, and they take them to Germany to work.\nAnd people start...uh, tried to give them bread and water through the window. They were\nin...1n cattle wagons. But the Hungarian, uh, gendarmes didn't let ge...uh, get close to those\nwagons. That I saw, and 1 ...I hear about what's going on. We had radios, and we hear what is\nhappening; but we said, \"This can't happen to us.\u201d We very... we were very optimistic, a little\nbit. Very fool optimistic. And then when the Nazis, the Germans, occupy Hungary--really\noccupy, in 19...March 1944, that was March 19th--starting from April Ist, 1st of April, we\nwere uh wearing the David uh star on our clotheses. And I was afraid to go in downtown or\nin the streetcars without star on...on my coat--because was still uh spring, and I was wearing\nstill a coat. But I went to work. That time, I left the hospital because the hospital was\noccupied by SS. And uh Jewish girl, other friend of mine, was working in the x-ray lab. She\nalso didn't went to work for them. And also I left the hospital, because we were afraid to go\nto work for uh ...1n the presence of the SS. Maybe they wouldn't take it out either. But I left\nthe hospital, and I start to work only a few weeks at [Angelo (ph)|--was the name of that\nphoto company. And I was working their laboratory developing films and doing copies\non...and so on. And I went home always when was already dark; and I put a uh overcoat over\nuh...about my coat, that the uh... the Star of David can't be seen. But my parents didn't let me\ncontinue to work; that they were very afraid that they're going to catch me. That means, I\nstopped working at [Angelo (ph)] before the ghetto, be two weeks. Then on--that was from\nIst of April, we had the Star of David. At first May, the same year--I mean, '44, 1944--they\nstart to take people into the ghetto in Oradea. Ghetto was around the orthodox synagogue in\nOradea. That was the Jewish quarter...quartier. And in the hospital... they...the...in the\nsynagogue, they set up the hospital. And uh in the ghetto, we moved to a family who was the\nrabbi in the town of Beliu. But unfortunately, he too, after the Hungarian came to\nOradea...come North Transylvania, he want to be moved from Beliu to Oradea. And\nthey...we move in their apartment; because we stay in the one room, and they stay--only the\nold man and his wife--in the other room. And I start to work in the hospital in the ghetto;\ndoing very simple, very routine test. Because they didn't have the equipment. They don't let\nto take the equipment from the Jewish hospital to the ghetto. Just simple test: drawing blood\nand doing some urine test. Very simple test. And also they trained me to give shots, because\nthey didn't have enough nurses. And that was from 4th May. That was my birthday when\nthey took me to the ghetto. And we were there until May 26th, when start the deportation\nfrom the ghetto. I didn't want to let my parents alone; and I preferred to stay with them and\ngo with them, not with the hospital group. And that was my luck, because the people with\nthe hospital group--nurses, uh sick people, everybody, doctors--they were taken direct in\nAuschwitz to the crematorium. That at Ist of June, going to the rail station--not the main\ntrain station in Oradea, to a littlest rail station in the [Rajdio (ph)] Park--they put us in the\nwagons. Cattle wagons, very very crowded wagons. We...everyone had just a little room to\nsit down. They put a [kibla (ph)] for uh toilet. No water, no nothing...a little water daily, but\nin a half-hour it was gone. And they locked the door from outside, and the train left the\nrailroad. They told us--these were the Hungarian gendarmes who take us to the...to the...to\nthe wagons--in the way before we start to leave the ghetto, they came with a bag to each of\nus and say, \"You have to put in this bag all your jewelry.\u201d They took my earrings, my watch,\nmy ring. Everybody put his jewelry in that bag. That means the Hungarian gendarmes took\nthose jewelries, not to... Because people, uh...they hide at home, or give to somebody to keep\nthem; but even they keep earrings or uh watches. Then the wagons start and they said that\nthey will take us to north Hungary in the puszta [the Hungarian prairie] to work in ...on the\nfarms. And we...we trust them; but later on they mis...we find out that they misled us.\nBecause then we arrived in Kassa.* That was the last Hungarian north city in Hungary. After\nKassa start already...well, the...the border to Czechoslovakia, which was occupied by\nGerman in that time. And because we then...they didn't get out at Kassa, didn't let out us to\nget out from the wagon in Kassa. They...the wagon and the train went to Poland. And...in\nCzechoslovakia, and then to Poland. In that moment, everybody was very very very scared;\nbecause we find out that they misled us, that we be in no Hungary, no puszta work, no\nnothing. They took us to Poland, but we didn't know where. And we traveled...I don't know,\nfrom Monday morning 'til uh Thursday dawn--I mean, Thursday early morning--when we\narrive in...1n Auschwitz. When we arrived there, we smelled the smoke. Was dark. And\nwhen we get out from the wagons, we saw people out the doors stripped dresses...uh, coats.\nThey were Polish people, mostly. They speak Yiddish; and they said, \"You have to do\nseparate lanes...uh, lines. The men for on one side, the women on the other side.\u201d And they\ntold to the womens--they have young children on their arms, or uh beside them--they said,\n\"Give the children to the old people, old womans.\u201d We didn't...these poor womans, they\ndidn't know what means. Which mother would left their child out from their hands? And\nthen we have...there we have time to say adieu to my father, to kiss him. And then (pause -\ncrying) ...then we start to go ahead in line. I was 1n the same line (pause - crying) ...with my\nmother and with the lady what...who...whom house we were living in the ghetto. I mean, the\nrabbi wife. And we just passed a few, I don't know maybe ha...quarter of mile. Very short\nway. And we saw a big side lights on the...directed towards us, that...and on there was\nstaying a very nice looking SS man. And we find out later that man was Mengele. And\nbeside him there were some helper--people with those stripped coats; and with the...his hand\nhe pointed to people. And because I was not on his side on the line--I was the inside line--he\npointed to me, and came two men. They grabbed me and put me out from the line, on the\nright side. I didn't have time to kiss my mother, or to see...to say something to her. I was\nterrible shock. And after that we find out that the people, they... I mean, the women, they...\nAll the people--I mean, my mother and all the others-- they then direct to the crematorium.\n* Hungarian name for city currently located in Czechoslovakia. Czech name: Ko%ice (German\nname: Kaschau). Located in an area which originally belonged to Hungary, but was made part of\nCzechoslovakia in 1918; occupied by Hungary from 1938 to 1945, but returned to Czechoslovakia\nafter the war ended.\nAnd they...when we were around one uh hundred or maybe more on the right side, they take\nus to the bath. We left all our clotheses on the floor. They cut our hair from all our body; and\nwe get a shower. We...you know? We...and then, with[out] any towel or anything, just that's\nhow we were, they give us a very very strange looking dress: long, short, terrible-looking.\nAnd some also very bad shoes; and they put us immediately, still wet, outside in the... in the\nyard. Outside the wash building. And there, from far away, were the mens also; because we\nsaw people with those stripped coats. And up today, I think--and maybe was just imagining--\nthat I saw my father between them. But I have...I was not sure. Then from there after a while,\nafter waiting outside maybe one hour, two hours--I don't remember exactly how long time --\nwe marched to the C Lager. And they put us in the Block 15. There was nothing. Just some\nuh straw on the floor. And, uh, the Blockalteste who was a Slovak--I mean, the Jewish girl\nfrom Slovakia--that was the Blockalteste. I mean, the boss over us. And she has some\nStubdienst--I mean, some helper--also Slovakian, because they spoke German. These people,\nthey were...they have some, uh, position. I mean, Blockalteste or Stubdienst were, uh,\nchoosed by the SS because they spoke...spake, uh, German, or a little bit Yiddish. They\nunderstood German. And those Blockaltestes, they're very very bad people. They start to\nscream to us, \"Why you came...let them to take you here? You know they are...they want to\nput you in the crematorium. Your parents are on the smoke.\u201d Uh, terrible things they\ntalk...talk. Everybody was in shock--crying, screaming. We didn't know...up to that moment,\nwe didn't know anything what's going on. And many people, they lost their consciousness\nand they get their prayers.... Terrible situation happen in the block. Crying, screaming.\nMany, uh, some of them went to the...to the fence, touched the wire. Get, uh...and they die,\nbecause they were with electricity. Very, very terrible situation happens. Then...we were\nsleeping on the floor, on that straw. And...and the night was pretty cold, because in--I don't\nknow what kind of climate-- maybe because we had only one cloth on...one dress on us. In\nearly morning in dark, they took us outside from the block to say the \"Appell\"--counting us.\nSitting five in a row or, uh, sometimes more, and they count and they count us hundred\ntimes, \u2018cause they knew how many should be. And the many times they made mistakes, and\nagain count. And we stood out on that terrible.... I mean, was cold in the early morning.\nVery, very, uh, tight to each other; and finally when the SS, uh, woman came and recount us,\nsome of us, they fell down or sit down because they couldn't stay. She start to beat that...that\nperson in the face. And was...was a...was a terrible, uh, way to...to stay at say the \"Appell.\u201d\nAnd this say the \"Appell\" again was afternoon. That means, was very warm. The sun was\nvery...very warm, that people were fainting from the warm...uh, from the warm. In the\nmorning, was very cold. In afternoon, late afternoon was very cold...very hot. Finally when\nwe get in the block, we get in a big bowl some kind of food: some soup--sometimes with a\npiece of...of, uh, potato in, sometimes just fluid. And we passed that bowl around five, six\npeople; and we were counting how many sips each one did. And save God if somebody\ndid...took more sips than, uh, uh, we were, uh, agreed to take each one. And we get a piece of\nbread--was all as ...as black, almost black and strong like a...like a stone. But we were very,\nvery hungry, and we eat every.... Somebody, some people couldn't eat; and those people they\ncouldn't eat, or [NB: either] they were very fancy or, uh, they didn't like it. They didn't\nrealize that is for survival. They die for famine. And uh the food had some kind of smell,\n[cabron (ph)]. There, after that, we found out that they put some bromide in the food to make\nthat the woman don't have the period. And I didn't have the period more that one year. And\nuh that was starting from June Ist. Then...I was eating, forcing myself to eat everything. The\nbread. Sometimes they give us a little little piece of margarine, or a little bit of piece of\nwurst--I mean, uh, cold cut. But very little. In--I don't know exactly--in July, they came and\nask us who wants to help to take some container to the other side, to the other, uh, lager--to\nthe B Lager. Because the kitchen was in C Lager. And those girls or women who get to work\nin the kitchen, they had a good life. I mean, they have enough food. And I went and I said, \"I\nwant to...to work, to take those container to the B Lager.\u201d Because they said, \"You will get a\nlittle bit more food when you finish with that work.\u201d And because I was hungry, I said I\npreferred to go and held those heavy containers and get a little food. And they took us...they\ntake us very early, in dark in the morning, to take out those containers to the B Lager. And\nwe...we passed through the main gate of C Lager, and that then we pass through the B gate\nof the ...of the B Lager, the gate of the B Lager. Once happen that uh the two of girls who\nwere coming on back of my side push us, touch our container. And the food was not\ncovered--I mean, the container was not covered. And a little bit of food spill out from the\ncontainer; and the SS uh woman saw this, and they punish both of us. We put down the\ncontainer aside, and they take us to the C Lager gate, and said to us to kneel. And we took\nbricks, bricks in our hands. We held up our hands with the bricks, and stayed there from\nthe...from dawn until the sun was...I think was already noon. And we were very afraid with\nthe other girl, because we...in that time, we know already about crematorium. And we were\nafraid that maybe as a punishment they going to take us to the crematorium. But uh at noon,\nthey let us go back to the block. And during that time when we were staying kneeling with\nthe bricks on our hands, we were uh heard from far...from far away their music bands\nplaying \"The Merry Widow.\u201d And we were crying and crying (crying), listening to that\nmusic; because I knew that uh music from my home, from before. And then finally at noon\nthey let us go back to the to the block, and we were happy that we escaped and they didn't\ntake us to the crematorium. And since then, I never went to carry those uh container. Even\nwhen I was very hungry, I was very afraid of something happen and that's the end. In\nAugust, came...they announce in the block that those people they were working in before--I\nmean, in their homes, in laboratory, in photography, as uh seam...as uh tailors--that means\nthey have fine hands, fine fingers. They go aside, and they choose us. I don't know how\nmany we were in our block. Maybe twenty-five, thirty. They take us to the Lager, the Block\nnumber 10. And there were also girls from other uh blocks from the C Lager, also in the\nsame category. After a while--maybe one week, ten days later--came a commission... I mean,\ntwo civil wearing.... I mean, not SS. Two men, and uh two SS men; and we had to pass in\nfront. They took in a...1n a room where on the wall there were a sign like in a ophthalmology\noffice. And we, they put us to read the numbers, to what...and they were looking how our\neyes are good or not. I mean, what line, lower line you can read. And also they touch our\nfingers. And uh I was choosen to go with that group, but I don't know where. We didn't\nknow where, whats means that. And they choose three hundred of us. Only three hundred.\nThey take us to B Lager in a block. Empty block. That means, only we were there. They say\nthat they going to keep us in quarantine for...I don't, I think three weeks. To see if somebody\ngets sick or some contagious illness. Unfortunately, one of the girls get sick; and they said\nthat she has typhus. I don't know if it's true or not, but they keep us, I think, two...uh ten days\nmore, to see if other girls get sick or not. But nobody gets sick; and I don't think she had\ntyphus. Just a diarrhea, or something [like] that. We don't...didn't have doctors there, just uh\nuh nurses; or there wasn't a good diagnostic to say that is typhus or not. Anyway, after...1n\nthe...after the quarantine was over, in the end of September, they put us in a wagon, in a\ntruck. They take us to the wash...I mean, to the shower room in Auschwitz. We were afraid\nto go...always we were afraid to go to shower, because in the shower happened that they let\nthe gas come out 1n...instead of water, they said. I don't know, but they said that that was the\nway how they did it. We...we get a shower there, and we get pretty good dre...clotheses.\nUnderwear, better dress, coat, better shoes, some uh stockings. That was something uh batik\n[NB: a scarf] on the...1n the head. We...we feel pretty ba...good, because we we didn't have\nlice in that time. But uh we very much afraid of lice. During the Auschwitz stage, I passed\ntwo times through a selection. There came doctors from uh...I don't know from where, SS\ndoctor; and we...we...naked, we shoot past in front of them. And if somebody have some\nlittle uh sign on his...on his uh body, this for put on the left. And they took them to the\ncrematorium. Was terrible selection, because they were afraid that the whole Lager B is\ngoing to have typhus or some kind of contagious diseases. And they do this...I was passing\ntwo times this kind of selection; but thanks God, I didn't have any thing on my body and I...I\ngo through. Now after we had that better clothes, we...they take us in a wagon. Not... not\ncattle wagon; a better wagon. Was not dirty, was pretty good. And they take us to\nWeifwasser.\u201d Was a place that the telephone ca...company had a big factory of air plane\nlamps. My factory was very close to Breslau [NB: Wroc_aw]. And there we have three\nbarracks. Each one of us, we had individual beds; uh, some, uh...some, uh, beds...not bed\nsheets, but uh blankets. Was uh was aa brick oven there. That means, in the winter we had\nsome brick, and we...we...we stay in warm room. And from there we were walking every\nmorning to the factory, under the supervision of the SS woman. And, uh, we worked eight\nhours, and at night we came home. I was working first in the chemistry lab, because I was\nregistered as a laboratory technician. But then they put me to...after a short while they\ntransfer me to the Cathode Abteilung [NB: Cathode Workshop]. That means I did the\ncathode part of the...of those lamps. Very fine, very little pieces, with, uh, four chips\nworking, uh...very, very fine. Very small, and very fine job. All day with the lights on those\ncathodes; and with some machine, I pinch each one and put something on the end. Anyway,\nwas very...a good situation there; because we was warm in the la...in the factory. That means,\nwe were not feeling the winter. Was already winter. The food was not too much; but, uh, we\nhad a nurse 1n the...in that, uh, barracks, was a part of barracks was the infirmary. There\nsomebody if he has something, uh, sick or, uh, cold or diarrhea was taken there; and the\nnurse was a Jewish girl was taking care. But they didn't keep...keep us too long in the\ninfirmary, because they were also afraid that they going to take us to crema[torium]. Because\nthey say that GroB Rosen--or I don't know which camp--was not far from there. And I\n* Subcamp of GroB Rosen. There were actually two subcamps with this name, one located at Kreis\nRothenberg in Lower Silesia and the other at Kreis Hohenstadt in the Sudetenland. The camp in\nSudetenland is where Firma Telefunken had its facility. The camp in Lower Silesia had a\nglassworks. It was evacuated in February 1945.\nremember I was one time I was very very hungry and very very very weak. I went to the\nfactory. I work, but I feel very weak. And the nurse was a very good person. I still...a long\ntime I keep in touch with her. She remain in Sweden. She married a Swedish man. And we\n...when we...when I was in the infirmary, she gave me extra food; and I get it, little bit, I feel\nmuch better after uh three, four days. And also she told me to came...after they divided the\nfood to everybody, to came to the infirmary. And she gave me a little extra food. She was a\nvery good person. She gave extra food to those girls they were a little bit...know a little bit\nthey were weaker. And I was between those. Then, at end of February--we were there from\nOctober [1944] 'til end of February [1945 ]--during the night we start to hear all kind of\nnoises; airplane and shooting. And they said that the Russia are starting to clo...to get closer\nand closer. And they evacuate the...that... those barracks, and they put us on feet to walk. I\ndon't remember exact the place where they took us--other Lager. And there also were a good\nnumber of people. They took those people, too; attached to our group, go further. Like a\nsnowball; at the end, we were a lot of people. I don't know how many--thousand, maybe.\nAnd from that date--from Feb...end of February until end of April, that means March--two\nmonths, more than two months, we were all the time going from here to there by foot, by\ntrain...uh getting out from the train, on the camp. And eating green leaves, and no water. And\nthen we start to get a lot, a lot of lice; because we didn't have water to drink nor to wash\nourselfs. And already was uh...at one night we were in wagon and the wagon was lock up.\nOne night we heard the SS men outside talking, of the wagon, \"Our Fuhrer is dead.\"-- \"Alter\nist tot,\" he said. And we...we just were listening, and we di.. we didn't know which Fuhrer;\nbecause was a Fuhrer of the camp, and was the Fuhrer Hitler. And then after that--that was\naround end of April...23, 24th April. Something like that; we didn't know exactly. I just\nglad said these, uh...find out this date. After a while, they...we were very close to\nDenmark, we find out; to the Denmark border. They put us...they take us from the wagon,\nand they set us in lane on that camp. And around us they set up some cannons, you know?\nAnd we were very, very afraid that they going to kill us. You know, I don't know how you\ncall those, which uh...Katushka* or something, they kill in line people. We say, \"Now, this is\nthe end!\" But after short time, maybe half hour, we saw an airplane flying very low. And\nthen gear down, landed not far from that point. Pass maybe one hour, two hours. They said,\n\"Get up, go back to the wagon.\u201d We didn't know what happened. Then we were sitting 1n the\nwagon; and in that moment, the SS was change to the Wehrmacht. People came...I mean,\nWehrmacht soldiers came to take over the wagons. And they were sit...they opened the door,\nand we were sitting on the floor with the legs outside, clinging outside from the wagon. And\nhe said--I remember I was very close to the door--and he said, \"Yah, you're going to go to\nthe good places. What...I don't know what going to happen to us.\u201d\u2019 And we passed through\nvery nice places, very nice uh towns and very nice places we go ...we went with the wagons\nthrough. And we didn't know what were going on. After a short while the train stop, they\nopen large the doors; and we saw... I was not in the first wagon. I was mostly in the middlest\npart of the wagon, but was a very long train. I find out later that we...that mean, we were four\nthousand. And during this uh going and coming, many times we... we observe that in the\n* NB: Katusha rockets, or perhaps reference is to machine guns (such as Kalashnikov rifle).\nmorning we are in the same place, circling around. And during the night, we heard many\nshootings; because they said that men started to try to escape. Anyway, when uh they opened\nthe doors, we look out and we saw nurses with white dresses and caps with red cross on their\nfront head. And...on the caps. And uh when they arrived to our wagon, there were two or\nthree civilian...two or three nurses and the Wehrmacht people. Maybe one Wehrmacht\nperson. And a man said to us, \"You are free now, and you going to stay overnight here.\u201d\nYah, they said that we are in the border with Denmark, at Padborg. That was a town or city.\nWe were not in the city; we...they take us to a farm during the ni...over the night. They said,\n\"You are now in the border of Denmark and uh...and uh Germany; and tomorrow you will\ngo to Sweden. You stay here overnight, and you are now free people.\u201d Everybody start to\ncry, to scream: \"Where is my mother? Where is my sister? Where is my father?\" We were\nin terrible shock. We didn't know what to...what to...what to think. Then came the Red Cross\ncars at every wagon, and they put us in those wagons, take us to the...to a very close farm.\nAnd so full with lice; they didn't uh disinfect us. They put us to a table, and they give us to\neat uh oatmeal with a little milk. Not too much milk. And naturally, we eat like wolves. We\nvery hungry; and they said that they don't give us too much food, because they don't want\nafter that big starving to eat too much. Because will not be good for us. And uh they give us\nsome, uh, sleep bags. And, uh, in a barn, a covered barn, we stayed there. We sleep in those\nsleeping bags over night. What was interesting in that barn, that in our...that group there were\nalso Kapos, Jewish Kapos, and the Blockaltestes and Stubdienstes. They were strong. You\ncan see from that picture, the last picture of mine, not everybody was skinny. Those, uh,\ngood looking girls, they were Stubdienst or...or Blockaltestes. They were eating well, from\nour food. Some strong--stronger, not too very strong--people are start to beat them well with\nsome sticks, start to...to beat them. But, uh, even they arrested one of them, one of the Kapos.\nBecause the girls start to scream that he was a Kapo, he was a devil; and they arrested that\nperson. In the morning, they took us to the railroad--so full with lice, with the same clotheses\non us...on us. And, uh, they put us in some wagons, first class wagon. All, everything was in,\nuh, velvet. You can't imagine. We are so...feel so bad, too, with those lice and dirty how we\nwere, to sleep on those velvet, uh, seats. And they...I don't know, they...where they took us,\nto Copenhagen or where. And then we ...",
        "A: OK.",
        "A: To take us, they...the cit...the train took us to the port. And they, we took a sh...they put us in\na ship. And we went to Malmo in Sweden. The ship debark in Malm6--that's the southern uh\nport of Sweden. In Malm6, also they put us in some uh Red Cross trucks. And they take us in\na forest; some military camp was there somehow, because there were tents. And that... there,\nthey disinfected us. They took...take all our clotheses. They look over our body...body. They\nwash us. Two persons wash us on a...on a bed--you know, a rubber bed. Because we have...I\nhave, I was so skinny that I couldn't wash myself. And uh because I have so many lice uh\npinches on my skin, the doctor thought that I have scabies. And they put a note on my wrist--\n\"Scabies.\u201d And I said, \"I'm sorry, it's not scabies.\u201d Because I know that scabies is itching,\nand I didn't feel any itching. And I said, \"These are lice pinches.\u201d Anyway, they put some uh\nsol...solution on my body. They wash it. They put some DD...DDT on my hair, because my\nhair uh where I had a little hair on uh... They put the DDT on my head. They made a turban\nwith a towel. And they give us very nice clotheses--a coat, nice shoes. Everything new. And\nfrom there we went to Landskrona, where in a school they set up a quarantine from us...for\nus. We get some uh sleep bags, and where we...we were uh sleeping on those sleep... uh\nsleep bags on the floor in...in the classes. The second day after we arrived there,\nthey...everyone was taken to x-ray, to a medical center or some...I don't know. Was a\nhospital, I think. They made x-ray on everyone. They check us; a very long medical check-\nup. They didn't took any blood. Just physically they check us: the eyes, the throat,\neverything. And then, who they find out they are sick--something on the lung, or they find\nsomething wrong--immediately they take them to the hospital. I didn't have anything wrong.\nI mean, just I was very very skinny. I had sixty pounds--thirty kilos. I was almost bone\nand...and skin. But in the quarantine, we had very very good food. I mean, very dietetic food\nthat didn't hurt. Nobody get diarrhea or stomach pain. Very, very careful given...uh, they\ngive us very careful, uh, dieting food, that after, uh, ten days everybody get a lot of pounds.\nAnd I don't know how many pounds I get, but I feel much stronger. And in this time, start to\ncome every day, uh, Jewish woman [NB: women], some... I don't know what was the name\nof the Jewish association of that...those women. They came to visit us, and ask about our\nfamily; and everybody was asking, \"How I can find out about my family--my parents, my\nsister, my husband?\" And they take the addresses and, uh, try to to find the list, what they\nfind in the...at the Nazis. Because they have lists. For example, our group--the three hundred\npeople--they find the group a telephone can with our names. I found this out not that time,\nbut later on. And, uh, that was May 4th when we arrive in Sweden. At May 7 was the end of\nthe war; and was a big procession in the street with flags, with uh...with uh... How you call?\nUh, Christian, uh, reverends, or...1n their, uh...",
        "A: ..1n their, uh, church robes, with, uh, lights, with, uh... How you call those? Uh... Saw\nlighting in the hand...",
        "A: Torches, yah. With torches. They parading 1n the street for the Peace Day. We find...they\nsaid that the...the war is over. And they stop in front of the...of the school--that was the\nschool then where we in, uh, staying. And they star...start to cheer us. Everybody was crying.\n(Crying) And then during that time already, we find out that North Transylvania became\nagain Romania. And we were from Romania--I mean, from North Transylvania--from\nHungary, from uh the...all part of Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland. All kinds of\npeople we were there. And the consulates from these countries came to visit us, and make\nthe list. And because I was from...taken from Oradea, they said, \"Oradea now is Romanian;\nyou belong to Romania now.\u201d And they give us...I don't know, very little of money; and they\nsaid to write letters if we have some relatives in South Transylvania. Because they knew that\nin North Transylvania, no Jewish relatives survive. And I knew the address of my uncle in\nArad, who was South Transylvania; but I miss the address with one number. I put 34\n[Nikoufilipescou (ph)]| Street instead of 32 [Filipesc... (ph)]; and he never get the letter.\nBecause the 32 was a dormitory of uh...I don't know which school, and they never get the\nletter. That means, from May I didn't get any answers. Nothing. I was very very...feeling\nvery very alone, and very so lonely; because other girls, they get immediately telegrams and\nuh news by telephone to the embassy that uh they were happy that they are alive, so on. I\ndidn't get anything. And then from there, after the quarantine was over, they take the\nRomanian woman from the quarantine to a place near Stockholm. I don't remember the\nname. There, we were only girls and womans from... from Romania. I mean, from North\nTransylvania; because all the Romania was not deported. And uh we were very well treated\nthere: food, and we get other clotheses. And from Stockholm, ...we were...1t was very close\nto Stockholm, that place. There were some villas on the seashore; very nice place. And uh\nwe had movies; and uh the Jewish ladies--I don't know exactly, I don't remember the\nassociation of those ladies--they came. They took us to Stockholm, to visit...to see\nStockholm. And they take care of us very closely. Very...very nicely. And we start to...to\nregain our...our uh lost pounds. And uh after a while, when we feel ex...not strong, we...we\nfeel boring [NB: bored] there. Because we didn't have what to do all day; just talking all the\ntime about the lager, about our life before, and.... We didn't ha...do anything, just waiting\nwhat going to happen. And once... after a while, we find out that we can go to work. And I\nget very friendly with three sisters. They, three of them, they get ...they survive. The older\nwas a seam... How you say it? She made uh clotheses...",
        "A: Seamstress, yah. The older--the younger, the middle one and the younger, they had no any\nskill. Myself, also; because we were just graduated from high school. And we said,\n\"What...what to do? How...what to work? What work we can take?\" And this older sister\nsaid... She left her girl in Budapest at the Red Cross; and she find out, until that time then we\nwere in that place, that her si...her little girl survive. And she was so happy, and...but she\ncan't get home immediately. Anyway, she said, \"Come with me to work as uh...in a\nconfection factory. And you have to say that uh you work in the past--a little lie--to work, to\nbe together, to don't separate us.\u201d And they...they... we went to Orebro. It's a pretty big city,\nwest of Stockholm. Not very far from Stockholm; maybe, I don't know, one hundred and\nfifty miles from Stockholm. A very very nice old city; and there was a confection factory by\nname [Tulene's (ph)]. They did uh suits for men and coats, for men and womans too. And we\nstart to work there. They...you know, the work in factory goes in line. We did all the...all day\nthe same thing. Uh sewing the line of around the hems, in...1n the vest of the...of the suits.\nThat means, uh was a very nice place. The daughter of the owner find us a nice apartment\nwith two bedrooms; and we stay in the same apartment and went to work. Very close was\nthe work place, in downtown Orebro.",
        "A: We stayed there...I stayed there--my friends, they went home earlier than me, because they\nlet go home first those people they find their closest relatives. I mean, the oldest--by name\nBlanca--she finds her daughter. She was the first. She went home. The middle one had uh get\ntelegram from her fianc\u00e9, who came from Ru...from uh Russia. I mean, from the forced camp\nlabor. The youngest one, they didn't want to separate them, they went together home first.\nThat mean, I was left alone. And I feel very bad; plus, I didn't know anything about my\nfamily. Finally, around Christmas, somebody gave me the idea... Because I know for sure\nthat my uncle is alive in Arad. I was thinking maybe they changed apartments or new\naddress, but I didn't know that. And somebody told me, \"Write a let...a telegram, send a\ntelegram to the Jewish community in Arad. Give their name, his wife name, his son name,\napproximately their age. And maybe they knew them, and they will answer you.\u201d And I did\nthat. And after very short time, maybe ten days, I get answer from them. From my uncle,\nsaying in the telegram, \"Came home! We...we wait you with open arms.\u201d And I was very\nvery happy that finally I get in touch with them. We start to write to each other; but that was\nChristmas '45. But I can't...couldn't go home until '46 in September. All that time, I was\nworking at [Tulene's (ph)]. I getting friendly with other girls; because in that factory, there\nother girls from other groups also taken from uh Germany camps. And we get friendly with\nthe..I get friendly with them; and uh we went to each other. We get in to movies. We have a\npretty good life there. The Swedish people were very, very nice to us. They invited to their\nhouses. But we didn't speak so well; very very little we speak Swedish. And when we start to\nspeak a little bit better, they still invited us; but we didn't felt good to go up to go to their\nhome. Because they all the time they were...they were asking us about how it was in the\ncamps, in the lager; and we were so...feel so bad that we didn't want to talk anymore about\n[it]. And finally in September, ...because I write...wrote a letter to the Romanian embassy\nthat I want to go to university and if I don't go uh sooner I will miss the scholar...the starting\nof the...the school year. Finally they send me...send me home in September. The coming\nhome was a torture; because we --together with other girls from other group--seventy of us,\nwe came by plane 'til Prague. Was exactly between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. That\nmeans, we spent the holidays there in Prague, in a hotel uh supported by Joint. Forty people,\nthey were going to America, to other countries. And when we said that we came from\nSweden and we go home to Romania. They said, \"You are crazy. You go back. We just go\nuh...leave Romania, and go to...\u201d And we were a little disappointed, but was no way to turn\nback. Finally, the Romanian embassy in Prague took--I don't know how many--fifteen or\ntwenty former war prisoner--Romanian, non-Jewish war prisoner. They were prisoner in the\nwest. I don't know by the Germans or by who. And they came together with us. We had a\ncommon...together the same visa, the enter visa to Romania--those prisoners and seventeen\nof us. They were very good people. I mean, uh they help us very much; because we be... we\nhad heavy luggages, you know? And they help us to carry those luggages. They...we give\nthem cigarettes and uh chocolate we have. And uh we pass from uh Prague to Budapest in a\nwagon full with uh wood. In the front of wood trains, where are the longer bars 1s a little\nplace. We were staying there until we passed the...the border. When we arrived in Hungary--\nI don't remember the name of that town--was a Sunday afternoon, and the peasants were\nstaying in. You know, 1n the...in the country, the peasants go to the railroad station to see\nwho is coming, who is going. And they were then, when they sawed us and they asked,\n\"Who are you?\" We said that we are uh coming back from the lagers, and so on. And they\nsaid--you know what they said. That was the first first disappointment of ours. They said,\n\"Oh, they come more people back than uh they left.\u201d And then from there, we went to\nBudapest; and from Budapest, again by very strange way, we went to Arad. Because Arad is\non the border between Romania and Hungary. And at the border of Romanian...Romanian\nuh...last Hungarian station and between the Romanian station, was a big trouble. The former\nprisoner, they have some blankets; and they said that those blankets are stealed, I don't from\nwhere stolen from. And they had a big discussion, and almost they fight. We were very\nscared, because that station was full with Russia soldiers. And the Russia soldiers that time,\nthey're taking everything what they can from the people and rape the women, and so on. And\nwe were very very scared in that little station, because they didn't let the train to pass to\nRomania. They stopped it; because they said that those uh prisoners, they have stealen some\nblankets. I don't know from where they said from them. I don't remember exactly. But we\nwere staying there overnight. Very scary. Then finally, we went though. We arrive in Curtici\n(Hung: Kiirtos]. That's the border, uh first stop in Romania. And uh from there...there I\nfind... Naturally, they... all of us went out from the train, and they start to look in our\nluggages. To control the... How you say? The...",
        "A: Immigration.",
        "A: [...my...I sent a note with somebody who says he goes to Arad to my uncle. That \"I am here,\nand please come to see me, take me from here.\u201d Because we...we stood there more...more\nthan a half day. They look in the baggage for... What is it? The Custom[s]. And my uncle\ncame with my...his son to Curtici, and we met there. And uh he came with a car. I don't\nknow, was not his car. He didn't have car. And they took me home, to his...to Arad.",
        "A: After the holiday--was after Yom Kippur, because was the Yom Kippur coming--I said to\nmy uncle, \"Look, I came home because I want to go to study. I can stay in Sweden, but I\ndidn't want to be a a confection worker all my life in a confection factory. I want to study.\u201d\nAnd uh he said, \"You can go to Cluj.\u201d\u2019 Cluj is the biggest uh city, university city, in\nTransylvania. Has a very old university, very famous university; and I went to Cluj and I get\nfirst grade at uh... How you say? Uh, I mean I didn't pay any tuition, any...",
        "A: A scholarship. I get a first grade. I am excited, I get first grade scholarship--not to tuition, no\npay for the dormitory.",
        "A: Yeah. I was in...in Cluj, I stood [NB: stayed] two years in a Jewish dormitory, supported by\nJoint. The name was [Anton Mark (ph)]. He was a famous mathematician, director of the\nJewish school in Cluj; and the dormitory and the canteen get the name of this very famous\nman. He die in the deportation. After two years, the...all the private dormitory were\nnationalized; and I went to live in a dormitory with other Romanian girls together. Was very\nnice. Was not any anti-Semitism. Was...was a good place. And I studied in Cluj until from\n'46 till '51; and I graduated as a industrial pharmacist, majoring 1n indus...industrial\npharmacy and minoring in bio-chemistry. That was '51. In 19...1n vacation I used to go home\nto my...to Arad, to my uncle. He send me money for the railroad, and I went home to their\nhome...uh house in vacations. And I met my husband in that time. In 1950, we get married;\nand one year we were separated. I mean, I was finishing the last year in Cluj and he was in\nArad. When I finished...I graduated from university, they were asking of everybody in that\ntime where you want to work. And because my husband had a good job in Arad, I said--and\nbecause in Arad was not any pharmaceutical factory--they said, \"You should work as a bio-\nchemist in a hospital laboratory.\u201d And I choose that, and I accepted. And I went to Arad in\n'51, and I get a job there. I get the job. They was something official. You know, in Romania\nat that time you didn't have to look for job. They sent you to the fixed job. And I started to\nwork there, and I work there until 1961. This time, we ask for immigration. Right in the\nbeginning. In uh '51, we ask...then start to...people to ask for immigration to Israel. We asked\nalso; we fill out all the papers, a long questionnaire, to go to Israel. We waited from '51 \u2018til\n'61 to get to Israel. And when we left Romania, we didn't left with a visa to Israel; because in\nthat time they didn't let people to go to Israel, because they were very friendly with the\nArabs. And how to cheat them, people were asking to emigrate to other country but they turn\nin Vienna to Israel. And because two of my friends get married in Sweden to Swedish uh\nmen, I...I wrote to them to send me a letter that I am their relative. In a very, very, very...in a\nvery very strange way I sent that letter; because they...they censored the letters. Somebody\nwent to Israel, and I told her their address and she wrote to thems. Very very difficult way.\nAnd she send me a letter, and with that letter we went to Swedish embassad [NB: embassy].\nThey give us a visa, and we get out from Romania with visa to Sweden. But when we arrive\nin Vienna, we turn and we get into Israel.",
        "A: We live in Israel from January 9...uh 19 '62 until uh February 12th--Lincoln's birthday, I\nremember exactly--19...uh 1968. That means, seven years. Yah.

That was uh one of\nthe first hospitals in Israel, from the Englishman that time. My husband, being a... They said\nthat you don't need to speak Hebrew, because in the lab they had Hungarian and Romanian\npeople and you can understand each other and do the job. And really, was that way. My\nhusband being an accountant, they put him in a ulpan in Haifa; and every Friday afternoon\nhe came to Afula, which was very close. Forty minutes, by bus. And after he finished, he\ncan't get a job in Afula. And uh he get a job in Jerusalem. Some friends of our was living\nthere. They have a bakery factory, and they give him a job.
