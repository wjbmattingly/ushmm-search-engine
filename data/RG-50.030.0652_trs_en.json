        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFred Lorber, on December 2\", 2011. The interview is conducted by Noemi\nSzekely-Popescu, in Washington, D.C. Fred Lorber is in Des Moines, Iowa. This\nconversation is being taped over the phone. Fred, can you tell me where and when\nyou were born, and your name at birth, please?",
        "Answer: I was born in Vienna, Austria, at that time an independent country, on\nNovember the 23\"4, 1923.",
        "Q: Thank you. And your name was?",
        "A: My name was the same, except I changed my first name; it was Fritz, and when I\ncame to the United States, it was changed to Fred.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Otherwise we \u2014 all names are the same, I-o-r-b-e-r.",
        "Q: Thank you. And can you tell me where and when your parents were born, along\nwith their names?",
        "A: Yes. My father was born in 1898 in Nadworna, which is a small town in western\nPoland, and he left there just at the beginning, or before the start of World War I,\nand emigrated to Vienna. My mother was born of five children. Excuse me, my dad\nwas of \u2014 was one of two children \u2014 two or three, and I don\u2019t quite recall. My mother\nwas one of five, and she and her parents left Belz, b-e-l-z, Poland. Again, that was\nDecember 2, 2011\nunder the governing ship of Austria at that time, before the first World War, and\nwhen the war broke out, my grandfather apparently had a general store in Belz, and\nthey buried all their merchandise, because they felt that the war would be taking\nplace where they lived, and they went on to the west, and they ended up with\nrelatives in Budapest for a very short time; then emigrated to Vienna at the\nbeginning of World War I.",
        "Q: How old were your parents around one \u2014 World War I?",
        "A: My parents were in their late 30s. Excuse me, when \u2014 you mean when they left?",
        "Q: Wh-When they got to Vienna.",
        "A: They were very young. I think \u2014 well, 1914 when the war broke out, so they were\neither 16 or 17 years old.",
        "Q: And how did they meet?",
        "A: That is a puzzle. I don\u2019t know. I think that the Jewish population of Vienna was\npretty large. I think the city itself was \u2014 had a population of about two and a half\nmillion, and about 200,000 were Jewish. And so apparently the people that came\nfrom the same areas in the \u2014 eastern Europe, because the Hapsburg Empire at that\ntime was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of western\nPoland, and Czechoslovakia and went as far as down to northern \u2014 what later\nbecame northern Italy. And so there was a lot of social activity going on, and I\nDecember 2, 2011\nreally don\u2019t quite know how they really met. All I knew that I was a child that really\nbe \u2014 that came in 1923, so the war was over in 1918, so this was a very difficult\neconomic time, and I \u2014 not very much was talked about on how they met, and I\nreally never found out.",
        "Q: Did they speak \u2014",
        "A: I should have been much more inquisitive.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what language did they speak with each other?",
        "A: They spoke German and Yiddish. And my \u2014 I think they both knew some Polish,\nbut I don\u2019t think \u2014 think \u2014 because their schooling both was done in ger \u2014 in\nGerman, because I| think that the Austrian empire at that time went as far east as\nwhere they lived. And most of the Jewish populations in these small cities, either\nhad a chayder, which was a religious school, where things were taught in Hebrew\nand in Yiddish. And then I think there was another school that I attended, which was\nin German.",
        "Q: What kind of \u2014 o-obviously they were Jewish, what kind of religious\nbackgrounds did they have? Did they have different tradition \u2014",
        "A: Ah, it was Orthodox.",
        "Q: Both of them?",
        "A: Semi-Orthodox. Modern Orthodox.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: Mod-Modern Orthodox?",
        "A: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did they keep a different religious life as adults than they had \u2014 had as\nchildren?",
        "A: Yeah, we joined a synagogue in \u2014 when I grew up. And I think that was rather\nlate. At that time there were small, and I think it then continued also in the United\nStates, there were little, itty-bitty storefronts, which functioned at high holidays, and\na rabbi somehow, he was \u2014 had another job, and then he conducted services at Rosh\nHashanah and Yom Kippur; the two, you know, very important Jewish holidays.\nAnd they were sometimes held at a storefront. But we belonged to a conservative\nsynagogue in Vienna when I was growing up. I don\u2019t know what the sh \u2014 really\nreligious affiliations were before I was born. I just never really \u2014 was so, I guess\ninvolved with the present time, and changes that took place culturally, and language-\nwise, and new locations, and all the things that took place that I think that the\ninquisitiveness was not there to find out how all these things really came to be.",
        "Q: Sure. Did your father serve in World War I?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did your father serve in World War I?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: No. He was \u2014 I think he was \u2014 he must have been 16 \u2014 15 years old, or 16 years\nold when the war broke \u2014 the war broke out in 1914 \u2014",
        "Q: \u00b014?",
        "A: \u2014 and he was born in 80 ni \u2014 in \u201998, so, he was 16 years old.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And he \u2014",
        "A: And I don\u2019t think he was an aus \u2014 I think he was a Polish citizen rather than an\nAustrian one, they [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 became later. So, he was not drafted.",
        "Q: I see. Did they speak German with you at home \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 or you were just \u2014 German?",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: Did you know Yiddish at all?",
        "A: Somewhat, yes. Not very well, but they did speak Yiddish and German and\nsometimes fall into Polish, but not very often.",
        "Q: What part of Vienna did you live in?",
        "A: In the 20\" district, which was a \u2014 Vienna had 21 districts, the first district was\nthe inner city, where all the [indecipherable] buildings, museums, and the opera\nDecember 2, 2011\nand all the public buildings were and the \u2014 was in central Vienna, and it \u2014 even\nthough it was the 20\" district, it \u2014 it joined the second district, which was very \u2014 it\nhad a very substantial Jewish population. The 20\" district also had a good size \u2014\nwell, not so [indecipherable] but had a sprinkling of Jewish population. And it was\nnext to the second district and the first district. So, 1t was pretty close within the\ninner city, even though the numbers really were the disparity.",
        "Q: What kind of socio-economic groups lived there? Was this a middle class, a\nmerchant \u2014",
        "A: Middle class. I would say middle class.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what was your \u2014 did \u2014 did both of your parents work, or only your\nfather?",
        "A: No, my mother never worked. My father worked for a fairly large manufacturing\ncompany of textiles, who had plants in Czechoslovakia. They made tablecloths and\ntowels and other linens, and their headquarters was 1n the first district in Vienna,\nand he was one of the sales \u2014 started out as one of the salesmen, later became the\nsales manager for the company for Vienna.",
        "Q: Do you recall the company\u2019s name?",
        "A: Yes. Heinrich Klinger, k-I-i-n-g-e-r.",
        "Q: And \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: They were on [indecipherable] I remember the address.",
        "Q: Oh, go ahead, give us the address.",
        "A: It was on Rudolfplatz(ph) and at least the significant, it stands out in my mind,\nbecause the Gestapo later on was kind of cattycorner from \u2014 there\u2019s a square, they\nwere on a kind of a small square, if I remember, with trees, and some \u2014 a few\nbenches, and diag \u2014 di \u2014 dial \u2014 diagonally \u2014 diagonally? Right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: There was a hotel, kind of a meet \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a luxury hotel, but 1t was a \u2014 it was a\ngood sized hotel called the Metropole Hotel, which later became the SS\nheadquarters and the Gestapo headquarters for \u2014 for Austria. And I'll refer to it later\non, because it did play a part 1n our lives.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you have a sense \u2014 do you recall the \u2014 the dates that \u2014 or maybe even\njust the years that your father worked there? Do you know the beginning and the end\nof the \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 I think \u2014 I can only give you a rough \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 estimate on that. I think he started working there at the end of \u2014 or the\nbeginning of peace, 1919 or 1918, and then became the sales manager, as I\nmentioned before, I think, for the \u2014 for the company, for the city of Vienna.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: Okay. Were you born an Austrian citizen?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was it an integrated group, did you go to a Jewish school?",
        "A: Yes. I went to \u2014 the first part I went to called a Volksschule, which 1s first four\ngrades, and did very \u2014 from what I understand, I did very well. Not because I was so\nsmart, but I think the competition wasn\u2019t very great \u2014 it was in a neighborhood\nschool, in a very traditional school building. It was, as a matter of fact, when I\nvisited Vienna later on, it was still there, and I \u2014 really, I think I was a little bit of\nteacher\u2019s pet, because my parents always got very good reports. I don\u2019t quite\nremember the names of the teacher, but there was a close relationship. In other\nwords, a respect between my parents and the teachers of that school, and I did come\nout pretty well academically.",
        "Q: And this was a public school?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: It\u2019s a\u2014no, it\u2019s a sc \u2014 well, yes, it was a public school, this one was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: From there I went to gymnasium, which is a kind of semi-private, or it was really\nthe track up to the university. And \u2014",
        "Q: Do you recall which one it was? The name of the school?",
        "A: Yes, Ul-Ultaberg(ph) gymnasium. It was named after the street 1t was on, 1t was\nnext to a very large well-known park called the Augarten, and it wasn\u2019t very far\naway from where we lived; I would walk to school. I took a \u2014 used to take me about\nprobably 25 or 30 to 30 fo \u2014 maybe 40 minutes, every day.",
        "Q: And the school did not have a religious denomination?",
        "A: They had a religious \u2014 they had a \u2014 Catholics had a priest come in and the class\nwas separated at that time, twice a week, I think, maybe an hour each time. The\nsame thing, we had a Jewish rabbi that came in, the students would be pulled out,\nthe Jewish students, and took religious in-instruction. I think that still 1s the German\nway of doing things, I think they still do that.",
        "Q: Do you recall \u2014 sorry \u2014 do you recall how many Jewish students went to your\ngrade?",
        "A: Yes, my class had a number of Jewish students, because the neighborhood, you\nknow, where we lived did not have many Jewish people, but there were maybe three\nDecember 2, 2011\nto four families on one large city block, or a couple of city blocks. And further\n[indecipherable] one fur-further toward the center of the city, the Jewish population\nbecame much larger. So, we did have an \u2014 quite a good part, I would say 30 percent\nof the students must have been Jewish.",
        "Q: Now what years \u2014",
        "A: The boys were separated from the girls, and I mentioned before that a rabbi\nwould come in twice \u2014 I think once or twice a week, and the Jewish students would\nbe separated again, and would take Jewish instruction.",
        "Q: And now what years were you at the gymnasium?",
        "A: What year was I at the gymnasium?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Ah, let\u2019s figure that out. Had to be from 1930 f-\u2014 let\u2019s see, I was born in \u201923, so\nsix \u2014 four \u20141n 10 years, when I was 10 or 11 years old, I went on to gymnasium\nfrom Volksschule. So I would assume I must have been 11.",
        "Q: Okay, so isn\u2019t that 1934?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And you were at the gymnasium until when?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: At when \u2014 when did you f \u2014 did you f \u2014 get to finish the gymnasium, or did you\nhave to leave?",
        "A: No. It\u2019s an eight year cour \u2014 it\u2019s an eight year \u2014",
        "Q: Eight years, okay.",
        "A: Yes, so I did the first four years.",
        "Q: First four. So 1934 through 1938.",
        "A: That 1s \u2014 so 1938, and when the Nazis took over in March of 1938, by May they\ntold us the Jewish students could no longer go to any public or semi-private school\nin \u20141n Vienna.",
        "Q: Okay, now I \u2014",
        "A: And I got kicked \u2014 in other words, all the students got kicked out.",
        "Q: Okay. Now da \u2014 I \u2014 I just want to go back a little bit \u2014",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 to the 30s. Do you have \u2014 do you have memories of 1933? Do you have any\nmemories of your parents discussing the Nazi party\u2019s rise to power in Germany?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what are those?",
        "A: The \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 what stands out in my memory, and it sometimes fades out, but I still\nremember, in 1938 \u2014 January of 1938, at that time the German and Austrian schools\nDecember 2, 2011\nhad a winter vacation. In Austria, their national sport is skiing, and soccer. And I\nwas just \u2014 I was put on skis at only six years old. So, I was with my school on a\nwinter vacation at \u2014 at some of the mountains, the [indecipherable] kind of not the\nAlps, but kind of the foothills of the Alps for one week with my school, skiing \u2014 for\na skiing vacation. And it was \u2014 had to be January of 1938. I still remember it\nbecause I wa \u2014 I participated in a ski race, and I won kind of a little trophy, and I\nwas very proud of it, and I \u2014 but by the second run or whatever it is, I ken \u2014I had a\nbad fall, or whatever it was, and I kind of dislocated my thumb, and I remember that.\nSo, when my parents picked me up at the railroad station, coming back from that\nschool vacation, they seemed at edge, and explained to me that things were not\ndoing very well. They had received information and in contact with some friends or\nrelatives in Germany \u2014 and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time,\nthe Nuremberg laws, which this qualified and you know, makes the Jews of\nGermany not only second class, but third and fourth class citizens and they lost\ntheir jobs, particularly if they were government jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies,\nor livit \u2014 or publishing and things like that, the discrimination really was beginning\nto really hurt in Germany, and my parents were very much aware of it. So when I di\n\u2014 they picked me up and I still remember they picked me up at a \u2014 at the railroad\nstation and on the way home were telling me what was going on politically in\nDecember 2, 2011\nAustria at that time. And it was, if you go back into history, there was a chancellor\nof Austria, his name was Schuschnigg, and he represented the \u2014 kind of a little bit\nof a also \u2014I would say little bit a of a dictatorship, but not as strongly as what the\nNazis had. He represented the Christian Austrian Christian party, which was the \u2014\nthe Conservative party. Vienna\u2019s representation was more social democratic, and\nmy father was involved in the social democratic party. And at that time there were\nall kinds of demonstrations in Vienna. The Nazis had become determined again that\nthey were, since 1934 the Nazi party was outlawed in Germany \u2014 in Austria,\nbecause they had tri-tried to have a putsch, and overthrow the government. They\nkilled Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr \u2014 in trying to do it, but that was aborted,\nand the Austrian government was able to arrest and \u2014 and kill some of the people\nwho tried to overthrow the government, and this \u2014 and that time outlawed the Nazi\nparty. So, in 1938, the beginning, the negotiations were going on between the pr \u2014\nthe president of Austria and Hitler. He would summon him \u2014 Hitler would\nsummon him to Berchtesgaden and really threaten him with all kinds of bad things,\nand scream at him, and was looking to annex Austria to Germany. And the guy\nstood firm, Schuschnigg did, for a while. So all this demonstration of voting for\nannexation to Austria, or Austria re-remaining independent, took place in the\nbeginning of 1938. Some of the negotiations that took place which \u2014 in Austria and\nDecember 2, 2011\nGermany, that Austria submitted to Germany, and let some people, Nazis, out of\nprison, and \u2014 and also appointed them to certain key jobs within the Austrian\ngovernment. Seyss-Inquart was one of them, and I don\u2019t quite remember what\nnames of the other people that became like the commissioner of safety, and some\nother tr \u2014 cabinets \u2014 j-jobs, and it really did not look very well for the independence\nof Austria at that time. I know a lot of street demonstrations in which my father had\nparticipated.",
        "Q: Do you recall \u2014",
        "A: So they were telling me this whole story, what was going on at that time.",
        "Q: Do you recall what they were saying?",
        "A: What they were doing? They \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, do you \u2014 do you recall what they were saying to you on the way back\nfrom \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s \u2014 they told me the politic \u2014 about the political situation.",
        "Q: Okay, and \u2014",
        "A: I also remember we went to a movie that day.",
        "Q: What was the movie?",
        "A: Yes, if I remember correctly, 1t was John Hall and Dorothy Lamour. Some\nmovie called \u201cHurricane.\u201d An American movie.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: Was any part of the conversation geared towards \u2014",
        "A: I should tell you my grandparents, who lived also in Vienna, had it \u2014 owned the\nmovie theater.",
        "Q: Oh. Which movie theater was that?",
        "A: That\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m sorry you asked me that, I don\u2019t remember the name.",
        "Q: Do you remember the location?",
        "A: I could point \u2014 I could point it out when \u2014 1f we would \u2014 you go to Vienna with\nme, I could point it out where the movie was.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember the approximate location, or what part of town it was in?",
        "A: Yeah, it was in the 20\" district, next \u2014 facing a \u2014 a park called the Augarten.\nAnd that\u2019s when movies were silent.",
        "Q: Were these your maternal \u2014",
        "A: They later on sold \u2014 they later \u2014 later on, I think gave up that and sold the movie\nto somebody else.",
        "Q: Were these your maternal or paternal grandparents?",
        "A: My maternal grandparents.",
        "Q: Did they speak German well?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is that something \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: They were fairly \u2014 they were well educated.",
        "Q: So this would have been a language they spoke back in Poland too?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you recall \u2014 be-before 1938, do you recall \u2014 oh, first of all, did you have any\nnon-Jewish friends, given that you were going to a new school?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes now, quite a few.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of their names?",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I played on a soccer team with non-Jewish friends.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I competed with the \u2014 I think that we were 12 and under. And I had a team that I\nwas part of it, and the day that I got the measles, the day that we was \u2014 I remember\nthat, because I couldn\u2019t participate when they played for the city championship.",
        "Q: Do you remember the team\u2019s name?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 growing up, and this is again, before 1938, an-and because you were in a \u2014\nin an integrated part of the city, and in a mixed school, did you witness \u2014 did you\nfeel any anti-Semitism growing in the 30s, did you witness any violence?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Good question. Let me just think for a minute. There were occasionally some\nwords thrown, anti-Semitic, you know, about Jews, but not too much, because many\nof my friends were non-Jewish, even though I had my \u2014 I also had two cousins to\nwhom I was very close, my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s sons. And one was same age as I, and\none was a year and a half younger. And they were very di \u2014 they, at very young,\nwere very involved in Hashomer Hatzair, which was a left wing of the Zionist\nmovement in Austria. And I used to also belong to that youth group. I'd go\noccasionally. I wasn\u2019t this vehement about it that \u2014 as my two cousins, to whom I\nwas very close. And we would sometimes walk together. And I don\u2019t quite\nremember, and I \u2014 I just don\u2019t know if there were ever any anti-Semitic sl \u2014 you\nknow, slogans \u2014",
        "Q: Slurs?",
        "A: \u2014 or words thrown at us. I \u2014 there must have been, but it may have happened\nlater, and not about that time. I think I lived a very secure \u2014 being an only child, and\nfairly \u2014 my parents, you know, were fairly well-off, and we lived a very\ncomfortable, middle class life, and I was never aware of these things, and I \u2014 most of\nthe kids I went to school with \u2014 not most, but a great portion of them were not\nJewish.",
        "Q: So, y-you just said that you were a member of Hashomer Hatzair?\nDecember 2, 2011",

And\nsomehow or other, I don\u2019t know, politically, I think we\u2019re \u2014 we were maybe much\nmore assimilated. My parents are very \u2014 they did \u2014 they were Zionists, to a degree. I\nmean, I remember going to certain propaganda movies that we went to as a family,\nwhich there was a tremendous amount \u2014 well, actually, tremendous is a little bit \u2014 as\nyou know, Herzl the founder of Israel was a li \u2014 you know, lived in Austria, lived\nin Vienna, and there was a \u2014 a very strong Zionist Jewish force that really played \u2014\nplayed a very, I \u2014 I think positive role in the Jewish life of Vienna. You know, there\nare 250,000 Jews living, so you had all kinds of political positions and beliefs. And\nsomehow my two cousins were very much into \u2014 into \u2014 even though they were one a\nyear younger, and one the same age as me, either 15 and 16 years, or 14 and 15\nyears old, they went to a lot of those meetings, and I didn\u2019t. Why? I still question it\nbecause later on I became very strong, both in my, you know, in my I-living here in\nDecember 2, 2011\nIowa, I was very involved in Jewish affairs, I was president of federation, I was\npresident of annual drive, and I\u2019ve been participatory in national politics, you know,\nwith AIPAC and some other organizations.

        "A: I don\u2019t quite remember, except my mother was \u2014 did give her money a few times.\nWe were fairly not \u2014 somewhat affluent, and \u2014 because I remember that \u2014 that many\nJewish people had no money, my parents used to dish out money. And there was a \u2014\na system where rel \u2014 if you had relatives, for example, in the United States, and\nthey had poor people, or people who ran out of money, or had \u2014 didn\u2019t have jobs, to\ntry to help the people in Vienna.

There\u2019s a\nblack market thing going on and you would have to pay 20 marks for one dollar.\nAnd this way \u2014 my parents would give money out that way to people who really\nneeded it, and the relatives who \u2014 to put some money into a bank account in \u2014 in\nNew York, that my parents had.",
        "Q: This would be your mother\u2019s brother, who had emigrated?",

        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go forward to 1938. Oh \u2014 ho-how do you remember that year?",
        "A: Well, I remember coming back from my \u2014 as I mentioned before, coming back\nfrom vacation and going back to school, and knowing what was going on politically,\non the outside, and that there was all the \u2014 there were all these demonstrations. Then\nin March \u2014 was it February \u2014 February, March, that the \u2014 the \u2014 the one Saturday\nmorning, the negotiations stopped, and the German army marched into Austria, and\nAustria became part of the German Reich.",

Things\non the radio, you know, warned you \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any private radio, or the radio\nwas controlled by the government, there was one station. No TV, of course, and we\nwere told to stay at home. There were all kinds of warnings given out. The \u2014 I think\nit must have been on a Saturday, and the German army marched in.",
        "Q: The warnings were over the radio, or did some friends stop by?",
        "A: It\u2019s over the radio, it was over the radio. And of course, I mean, words traveled in\nbetween people, and friends and relatives and \u2014 so you heard this really changed\nfrom a\u2014 it was expected, you know, it wasn\u2019t anything that surprised people, except\nit shocked everybody. So, many of my friends went out to the Rykestrasse, it was\njust a main drag in Vienna in the first district, on which all museums or parliament\nand the opera, and all the \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s where wos \u2014 it\u2019s like Champs Elysees in\nParis, it\u2019s a six \u2014 six or eight or 10, or I think in \u2014 avenues, like very wide and dep \u2014\nso there was a parade there of the German \u2014 as the German army marched in.",
        "Q: Were you there with your friend?",
        "A: No, no, I was at \u2014 two weeks later [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Were these \u2014 were any of these friends Jewish?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Some were ja \u2014 yes, but they were \u2014 did not live \u2014 what hap \u2014 to \u2014 one friend that\nlived next building to us, who was about eight months older than me, or a year older,\nand the rest of them were not Jewish. The [indecipherable] friends I had lived next\ndistrict, in the second district, what a \u2014 18\" district, or \u2014 or were school friends that\ndid not live where I lived. So there was one or two Jewish, I think one that I was\nclose to. I still remember his name, Leo Schickler(ph), and we were kept at home\ntha-that day. So, things changed very rapidly. I was told that our school would stop;\nJewish kids would no longer go to school after summer vacation. I mean, July, we \u2014\nwe were all kicked out. At \u2014 what happened at that particular time, the \u2014 the\nimmensity of the political change really did move very fast, but it was not at that to\n\u2014 time, life threatening. It wasn\u2019t a point that I would get beat up on the street, or\nwould get arrested. So, what really happened to begin with, that small Jewish\nbusinesses, of which there were many in \u2014 in Vienna, you know, haberdashery\nstores, or grocery stores, or what the case may be, all the graffiti was to be painted\non their windows, don\u2019t buy here, Juden, it would say, or they would have the star\nJew \u2014 you know, Star of David painted on the windows, or they would \u2014 they would\nput an SA guy as a Brownshirt, you know, semi-military person in front of the store\nand discourage people from walking in.",
        "Q: Do you remember what that was like to see one of those graffitis?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yes. It was scary. The \u2014 I could tell you what \u2014 what kind of threw me off. I used\nto read quite a few books and I belonged to a private library, and so I went to return\na book to the library, and want to take out another book, and they told me that I\ncould no longer have a membership there. And I was startled, and I said why? Well,\nhe said, you\u2019re Jewish and we cannot any more allow you to be a member here. I\nwas in \u2014 I think of all the things I\u2019ve no longer been able to go to the movie, or to\nstand on a railroad ca \u2014 excuse me, on a streetcar, rather than sitting down, or that \u2014\nthat was long before Jews were forced to wear a Jewish star, you know, on their\ngarments. We had no identification except everybody wore a swastika in their lapel,\nexcept the Jews. So I was, you know, you\u2019re easily recognized.",
        "Q: Now you say \u2014",
        "A: You were Jewish.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you say except the Jews. Did your \u2014 did your \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: You were saying everyone was wearing swastika lapel \u2014 o-on their lapel \u2014",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable] Jew was \u2014 was \u2014 and there were different kinds of\nswastikas, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 you know, the early Nazis had a number on their swastika emblem, and they\nhad a red \u2014 it was red and black, and it was a \u2014 with a swastika in the middle, so you\nknew they were party members, and that there were others. But everyone wore a\nswastika except \u2014 if I would have been caught wearing a swastika, I don\u2019t know\nwhat could have happened. So Jews didn\u2019t do that. They were not allowed.",
        "Q: Did your parents have any non-Jewish friends?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. We had some neighbor friends, to \u2014 my parents did. I\nlater found out that they were very helpful to my parents, and I\u2019Il mention that later,\nbecause I returned, you know, to Vienna as a soldier. And then later my mother\nwould say, and she sent me money to give out, American dollars. I went to \u2014 to our\nold building and I knocked on doors, and I dished out like hundred dollar bills on\nmy visit there, to certain people that Mother \u2014 my mother gave me names, who were\nhelpful, who were \u2014",
        "Q: How far did a hundred dollars go?",
        "A: \u2014 or 50 dollars, or 20 dollars, but th \u2014 she did send me hundred dollar bills, I\nremember, and she gave me instructions who to give the money to.",
        "Q: But you were unaware, or you hadn't much \u2014",
        "A: I was unaware who \u2014 I think it was kept fairly secret, you know, on what help\nthey received. And because we \u2014 there was no \u2014 one other Jewish family that lived\nDecember 2, 2011\nin our apartment building, who left very early, they were very close friends from my\nparents. And another Jewish family which was really half Jewish, where the husband\nwas Jewish, but the wife wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did they leave?",
        "A: And that was the Jewish \u2014 and then next building to ours, there lived a Jewish\nfamily, and when my father was arrested in November 10\", you know,\nKristallnacht, my f\u2014 one of my friends lived next building, also was arrested. And\nthey were arrest \u2014 they came to arrest me on November the 10\", and my mother \u2014\nand came \u2014 two storm troopers came to our apartment and wanted to arrest my\nfather and me.

So, because it was all done, they burned down every synagogue on\nNovember the ninth and 10\", and \u2014 and then by the 11\" and 12, it just \u2014 they\narrested so many people they had no room, and th \u2014 1t overwhelmed them. My father\nwas \u2014 we found out that somebody said they saw him carrying out \u2014 the field\nkitchen, helping carry out a big pot, which they fed, at one of the closed schools\nwher-where we lived, in the same district. So we rushed over there, and sure enough\nwe saw my dad carry out a big \u2014 a \u2014 with another man, a big pot, you fill it up with\nfood or soup or whatever it was, from \u2014 it was \u2014 the field kitchen was on the \u2014 you\nknow, on the street, and a lot of people smelling around, watching and trying to find\ntheir relatives. They had heard they was arrested there. And we waved to him, and\nthat was the last we saw him. He then, the last we heard was we got a postcard,\nwhich was preprinted. It must be somewheres around, I don\u2019t know. I hope I kept it.\nI don\u2019t know where it is. My wife and I are going to \u2014 through \u2014 go through some of\nour things that are stored away in our basement. And \u2014 and we wave and my \u2014 we\nhollered, and \u2014 and we threw kisses, and that was last we saw him. And next thing\nwe heard was that postcard, preprinted, and all \u2014 it was kind of green, I remember.\nAnd it \u2014 on it had my father had a very Leon \u2014 Leo Lorber with a big, very nicely\nhandwriting. And the only thing that was there was all preprinted, I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m\nDecember 2, 2011\nfine, I\u2019m all this, and all that. Which every postcard said the same thing, and then his\nsignature, which we recognized.",
        "Q: Did he \u2014",
        "A: So we knew he was alive, and that was from Dachau.",
        "Q: Did it give his location, did it say it was Dachau?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, I \u2014I just want to go back very briefly to the night that your father is\narrested. You said that the \u2014 the two men who came were not physically violent?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they say \u2014",
        "A: They were very correct.",
        "Q: Did they say why they were taking him, and where they were taking him?",
        "A: Yes. No. They didn\u2019t say what, he said, we have orders to come to arrest wip \u2014 th\n\u2014 every synagogue has been burned down. Your \u2014 it was called the [indecipherable]\ntemple, where we worshipped, not far \u2014 well, a few blocks \u2014 quite a few blocks from\nour house. And \u2014 and we\u2019re here to arrest Mr. Lorber, Herr Lorber, and\n[indecipherable] Fritz Lorber. They showed that they had a warrant for our arrest.\nSo, that was it.",
        "Q: Okay, so they take him away, and \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yes. And then you heard what \u2014 that the last \u2014 next we heard. He later told me\nthat \u2014 this \u2014 the most people \u2014 1t was November, and it was cold, that the \u2014 it was a\nkind of a cold November. And many people when they got arrested, they didn\u2019t\nbring warm clothes. And they put them on these for \u2014 what we called 40 and eights.\nIt\u2019s a\u2014no, it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s a railroad car, you know, where they transport horses\nor \u2014 or merchandise, you know, not \u2014 not a passenger car.",
        "Q: Sure, sure.",
        "A: And they were so crowded, that people stood up. And they would \u2014 they would\nhave that real \u2014 that train stopped on [indecipherable]. And it took from Vienna to\nMunich, where Dachau is located, I don\u2019t know, two days, three days, and it was\nvery cold, and people would defecate \u2014 they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t let them out of\nthose boxcars \u2014 right there. And many people who were old and fragile, not \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how many, but some people died on his \u2014 where he was standing. He was less\nthan \u2014 you know, you\u2019re born in eight \u2014 1980 \u2014 eight nine \u2014 \u201989 \u2014 \u201998 \u2014 \u00b098?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019m getting confused [indecipherable] the numbers. And \u2014 and so he was\n\u2014 this was 1938.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was 40 years old. He was a young man.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And so he was strong, he was \u2014 he was \u2014 I\u2019m looking here, I have a picture of\nhim here in my o \u2014 I\u2019m sitting in my offi \u2014I have an office in my home, and \u2014 and\nthere were people that were 70 - 75 years old, who couldn\u2019t stay, you know, who\ndied, on the short trip \u2014",
        "Q: In \u2014 on the \u2014 on the transit.",
        "A: Yes, on the transit. And he said that was very, very terrible. He would ra \u2014 never\nspeak, or try. Never \u2014 I tried to, and he didn\u2019t want to talk about his in \u2014 being\nincarcerated into Dachau.",
        "Q: He never wanted to talk about Dachau itself, or the ride to Dachau?",
        "A: No. The ride, nor about Dachau.",
        "Q: Now, the \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: Was very unpleasant. He told me one thing \u2014 no, he didn\u2019t tell me this, I heard it\nfrom a relative of ours who was in the same barracks as he was. My father was very\namb \u2014 he was a \u2014 he was a very hard worker, and very conscientious about what he\ndid. And this is what I heard; he would never tell me that. He washed handkerchiefs,\nhe washed rags in \u2014 you know, where water was available at night, during the night,\nfor people. A rag in your pocket was probably the most important possession. Every\nmorning they \u2014 all the prisoners were in mass formation, like six o\u2019clock or 5:30 in\nDecember 2, 2011\nthe morning, standing out there, you know, by barracks, and they would count them\noff and make sure that nobody escaped, which was a \u2014 which was a lot of bull, but\nthey kept this discipline in this thing. And as a matter of fact, my friend who was\narrested was a year older than me, lived next door to us \u2014 I mean, next building to\nus, Leo Schickler(ph) his name was, also told me his experience, you know, in the\nmorning. And they would say that barracks number 104 can go to the latrine at 10\no\u2019clock at night. No other time. And everybody, every barracks was assigned a\ncertain time to go to the bathroom, to relieve themselves. And there was a lot of\ndysentery, so people couldn\u2019t control their bodily functions. And they would have to\nwait. So they would, you know, make up and make it in pa \u2014 in the pants. And they\nneeded to have a rag to wipe themselves with. And that was very important\npossession. And then at night, they would \u2014 he would help people who we-were\nincapable of doing it, to wash their rags. I heard that from another person that \u2014\nabout my dad.",
        "Q: This was a person who had been incarcerated with your father?",
        "A: He did it for a lot of people.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you friend Leo Schickler(ph) ever encounter \u2014",
        "A: Well, he tells me that story, my friend \u2014 this is fore be \u2014 before penicillin and we\nall, including me, always had earaches, very early in \u2014 you know, the de \u2014 there was\nDecember 2, 2011\nno \u2014 you just to outgrow something, you \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, but we all had\nearaches when we grew up. And he was a year older than I, and he was standing in\nformation at five or six o\u2019clock in the morning, and \u2014 and a guard came by, you\nknow, the counting off, and he said anybody \u2014 he said, anybody needs to go to the \u2014\nto see a doctor, what is it, to \u2014 to the \u2014 what am I thinking of, what word?",
        "Q: Infirmary, hospital?",
        "A: Yeah, clinic, clinic \u2014",
        "Q: Clinic?",
        "A: \u2014 whatever they had, yeah. And he raised his hand, and he said, what\u2019s wrong \u2014\nand a guard came over to him, and he says, number \u2014 had a number, didn\u2019t call you\nby name, called you by number. He says, what\u2019s wrong? And he says, I have an\nearache very bad, and I need something, terrible. He says, which ear, and he show \u2014\npoints to his right ear. And the guy takes the stock of his rifle and smashes it across\nhis right ear, knocks him unconscious. He says, now this will help you, ther \u2014 it will\nstop hurting. It was little things like that \u2014",
        "Q: And I \u2014 I\u2019m assuming Leo survived?",
        "A: And I figured you know, and then \u2014 and then the rest of them didn\u2019t want to talk\nabout. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it just seems almost unbelievable that a culture or a \u2014 you know, a\ncivilized people would have members in their midst who would carry out these\nDecember 2, 2011\nterrible things. And you know, and particularly Germany that, you know, has a rich\nhistory of democracy and civil \u2014 and scholarship and education and health care and\nall the other things that took place in the 18\" and 19\" century, would \u2014 would be\nable to change a people to these murderers, and unbelievably s \u2014 without conscience\ntype of animals. I mean, they lost all their sense of value, and sense of humanity.\nAnd that always puzzles me. I\u2019ve had some discussions on that when I talked to\nsome German soldiers, you know, that we \u2014 in \u2014 that we had in our \u2014 we picked up,\nand \u2014 when I was overseas. All right, so that was \u2014 now I will tell you how we got\nmy dad out.",
        "Q: Now hold on, I\u2019m just \u2014",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: \u2014 I\u2019m going to pause just for a moment.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: One second. Okay, I\u2019ve un-paused it. I just asked Fred whether he wanted to take\na break, but he is good to go. And my question is, your friend \u2014 your friend Leo, did\nhe survive the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Then we\u2019ll get back to the story later. You wanted to talk about how \u2014\nabout your father.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t quite recall the panic, or the helplessness, cause I don\u2019t remember\nthat. I just tried very hard to try to figure out what did it really feel like. And what I\nwas really doing. Well, in the meantime, there were some Jewish organizations and\nsome Americans that came to, or were in Vienna and established some trains, and\npicked up where the public schools left off. I was given a choice to \u2014 to learn a trade.\nSo I was 15 years old. And I was assigned to a Jewish dentist, who could only do \u2014\ntreat Jewish patients, and became his assistant. I would, you know, mix plaster of\nParis and help make false teeth, now, you know, to put people\u2019s \u2014 that had problems\nwith their dentures and other things like that, and I would assist this and learn how\nto give the right instrument to this \u2014",
        "Q: Was dentistry \u2014",
        "A: And that was a Jewish je \u2014 single, young man who was a doctor, and I was\nassigned to be his assi \u2014 learn the trade, as a mit \u2014 as a dental mechanic, or whatever\nit was called, and \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t go to school, there was no school for Jewish\nchildren.",
        "Q: So was dentistry something you could choose amongst other things, or was this\nassigned as a \u2014 a subject?",
        "A: It was a big \u2014 I have a picture of \u2014 someplace, of the sign, his sign on the outside\nof \u2014 of this apartment building. Big sign, with a Jewish star on it, and it says, you\nDecember 2, 2011\nknow, it gives his name, being a dentist, and underneath it said, only Jewish patients,\nhe could not treat anybody else. And I worked for him maybe for \u2014 this is a time that\nmy father was gone, and so that must have taken some \u2014 some of the hurt and guilt\nfeelings and uncertainties away from me, you know, learning a trade, or learning a\nprofession.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it a choice amongst trades, or were you assigned this trade?",
        "A: Yes, I think there must have been, and I don\u2019t quite \u2014 I don\u2019t remember whether I\nchose it, or they told me that\u2019s what I have to do, or here\u2019s my chance to do it. His\noffice was not very far away from where we lived, so I could walk there in the\nmorning, and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you recall what street 1t was on?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Do you recall what street 1t was on?",
        "A: I\u2014I could point it out to you. I don\u2019t remember the name of the street, 1t was on\n\u2014 my \u2014 you know, my German is really \u2014 it has disappeared quite \u2014 quite a bit. Let\nme just think. There is a danuk(ph) \u2014 have you ever been in Vienna?",
        "Q: Yes, but I\u2019m not very good with the topography.",
        "A: Okay, there is a\u2014 a river that runs through the city \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 and it\u2019s like the canal, the Danube canal, it\u2019s a \u2014 they had \u2014 it\u2019s an artificial\nthing. It\u2019s not the Danube, the Danube is on the outskirts of Vienna, but it\u2019s in the\ninner city. And my \u2014 then there is a \u2014 between the first and the 20\" district, ther \u2014 th-\ntha-that Danube canal runs. And next to it is a park that runs along the river, with\nbenches and trees. And my grandparents\u2019 apartment was \u2014 it was called the Lande,\nl-a-n-d-e, with an umlaut \u2014 with that umlaut over the A. And his \u2014 they \u2014 he was\nabout a block away or a few buildings away, the dentist, from where my\ngrandparents had lived, in this very, very nice apartment, on the Lande. So \u2014",
        "Q: Speaking of benches, did \u2014 do you recall any benches being segregated?",
        "A: Every bench. I\u2019ve gotta tell you, because this \u2014 about \u2014 you asked me. When I got\nout of school, gymnasium, there was a park called the Augarten, which is a very\nlarge park. It is part of \u2014 was right next to the exit of my gymnasium, and the kids\nwould meet out there after school, and there were benches in that park. Every bench,\nin every park in Vienna was immediately, they have stenciled on the back of each\none, Juden verboten. Jews \u2014 Jews cannot sit on a bench. Now, I\u2019ve been in Vienna\nfour or five, maybe six times, and I\u2019ve been riding my bike someti \u2014 there\u2019s a bike\npath that runs from Germany into Vienna and I\u2019ve been on that a few times with\nmy bicycle, and \u2014 and some time it occurred to me what I have to do is go to this\nDecember 2, 2011\npark where they \u2014 every bench said Juden verboten, I would sit on these bench \u2014 I\nsat on eight benches there in a half hour, just to get even with them.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: I think it was about three, four years ago. And I think people sitting there,\nlooking like I was crazy. And anyways, I felt I had to do that.",
        "Q: D-Do you recall any incident when you were \u2014 in \u00b038, when you would be going\nthrough this park, perhaps with non-Jewish classmates? Any kind of sense of you\nbeing different?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: D-Do you have any \u2014 any story that illustrates that?",
        "A: I felt insecure. I fa \u2014 if I see a group of young people, men, you know, boys,\ntravel \u2014 who are walking, you know, they\u2019re with four or five, six together. I would\nfind a \u2014 out pretty quick \u2014 I was running, I was a\u2014I was on a track team in my\ngymnasium also. So I was little \u2014 I was somewhat athletic. And \u2014 so I would find\nsomeplace that I could disappear, or run, or make sure I don\u2019t cross that path.",
        "Q: This would have been before or after you were wearing the star? I\u2019m assuming at\none point you had to wear a star.",
        "A: There was no star.",
        "Q: There was no star?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Never. No, no, we left before the star became law.",
        "Q: Were you running because you felt that they would recognize you?",
        "A: I would tra \u2014 yes, they would \u2014 I would be threatened, or I would be beat up, or\nwould had some confrontation, and I tried to avoid that.",
        "Q: Was that because they knew who you were, or was there a way of recognizing\nyou?",
        "A: Well, they knew it would \u2014 I mean, the first thing is \u2014 I should ste \u2014 send you a\npicture, do I look Jewish? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Well, the question is, did they think you look Jewish?",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly it. I didn\u2019t wear a swastika in my lapel, an-and \u2014 and I have curly\nhair, to this very day. And \u2014 and I think that maybe I do look \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I look\nJewish or not. I think in the United States I don\u2019t, but I think in Austria I may have.\nAnd you know, I was 14 - 15 years old. So it \u2014",
        "Q: Now was there any altercation that actually happened, or did you just \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I knew it was going to happen, I would get confrontation.",
        "Q: What would they say?",
        "A: They would, you know, call me names, dirty Jew, or this and that. And at this\ntime I was very sensitive to that. I had \u2014 I did have a number of non-Jewish friends\nwho were very \u2014 who really stuck with me, very early in the game. And I \u2014 when I\nDecember 2, 2011\nwent with them, was no problem. But my mother was not very happy that I would\ngo to places I shouldn\u2019t be.",
        "Q: What kind of places?",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to a movie, and I did sneak in a few times. I-I think\nthere are certain places that \u2014 where Jews were not allowed, a park. I did not sick on\na park \u2014 I did not sit on a park bench until that episode I mentioned. And I was very\nsensitive and really very careful on how \u2014 what my behavior was, and that almost\nany time I walked or went someplace, I was very, very \u2014 I knew I was very\nvulnerable, and I was very careful about doing things.",
        "Q: This heightened sense of vulnerability, did this only, well, grow after\nKristallnacht, or where you already quite sensitive before?",
        "A: Well, how do I \u2014 okay, there was a famous Jewish \u2014 that\u2019s not \u2014 I\u2019m sorry,\nfamous German author called Karl May. Ever hear of him?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: He wrote 64 books, each one four, five, 600 pages, I\u2019ve \u2014 I think I read every one\nof them. And he wrote about America and about the Indians and the trappers and\nthe west \u2014 the American west, the \u2014 he had heroes like Winnetou and Old\nShatterhand \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, Iam \u2014I am familiar with those books.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Okay. I read every one of the books. And it \u2014 he really \u2014 and the guy never left\nGermany. He \u2014 all out of his head. As a matter of fact, two of my friends and I, we\ndecided to revisit some of our last \u2014 was it two years ago, we went to Paris and\nBerlin and \u2014 and Vienna, and doing kind of some spots from the second World\nWar, and they\u2019re both veterans. And we stopped in Berlin for a week, and they had\nan ex \u2014 they had a special exhibition at one of the museums, the city museum of\nBerlin, of Karl May. He was a faker, you know, but he wrote the books that to this\nvery day are very popular, a hundred years later, still very popular in Germany. It\u2019s\nall about America, the American west, Indians and trappers and the whole thing. So\nI was big fan of that. As a matter of fact, once one of my teachers asked my mom to\ncome to school because te \u2014 she felt I was reading too many of those books. So I had\nthat little adventure seed planted into me. So it became a game to me a little bit, of\navoiding being \u2014 you know, meeting someone that \u2014 with whom I would have a\nconfrontation. And having \u2014 and living in an area which there were mostly non-\nJews. I was used to that, and the people were somewhat protective of us wher-where\nwe lived. I don\u2019t ever remember being threatened or \u2014 except that one thing of our\ncleaning lady coming and then demanding money from my mom.",
        "Q: Was this before or after \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: And our neighbors \u2014 our neighbors were very, very \u2014 they didn\u2019t go out of their\nway, they didn\u2019t ou \u2014 they didn\u2019t violate any of the Nazi laws, but they were\nprotective of us.",
        "Q: The cleaning lady who came to demand money, this was before or after they took\naway your father?",
        "A: I have to think about that. I think it was after they took my father away.\n[indecipherable] that my mother was \u2014 she was very strong, she was really\ndetermined. And she \u2014 we got my \u2014 I got \u2014 we got my dad out of \u2014",
        "Q: Dachau?",
        "A: Dachau.",
        "Q: What \u2014 I \u2014 and I want to talk about that, about \u2014 but one question. Be-Because it\nwas your mother who stopped the \u2014 the officers from taking you away on\nKristallnacht, did her attitude change about safety, especially your safety in the\nmonths after Kristallnacht? Was she particularly concerned?",
        "A: I think she very \u2014 she became very careful, and very sensitive to what was going\non and wan-wanted to make certain that I don\u2019t make any waves, or to open up my\nmouth and say the wrong things.",
        "Q: Di-Did she say something specifically? What not to say?",

        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I think it\u2019s primarily the environment she created, probably more than\nanything else. She was a gutsy lady, she was very smart. And not because she was\nmy mom, and I\u2019Il \u2014 it\u2019Il come as I tell you my story, but she \u2014 she had her \u2014 her feet\non the ground almost all the time. She never panicked. And there was plenty of\nopportunities to panic.",
        "Q: You were talking ab-about trying to get out of the way of \u2014 of young men on the\nstreet \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 but that you felt relatively safe when you were walking with non-Jewish\nfriends. Do you recall whether these friends perhaps were wearing any swastikas on\ntheir lapel?",
        "A: Yes, they all did.",
        "Q: They all did?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How did they reconcile that with the fact that you were Jewish? Was this ever a \u2014\na conversation?",
        "A: That\u2019s my phone, so don\u2019t worry about that.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Ah, 11 o\u2019clock here. Give me your question again?",
        "Q: Well, the question was, you \u2014 you were feeling relatively safe walking \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t quite say [indecipherable] I think they all wore swastikas, I can\u2019t swear\non that. But I think that was the \u2014 that was the law. That was to be able to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nsurvive, to be \u2014 you know, the whole country took on an entire different look. Go\nand see that film that \u2014 that is \u2014 you have in your library, about Vienna. It\u2019s a 10\nminute film \u2014 if I have it handy here \u2014 no, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s someplace here in my office.\nAnd, I could look at it. And you have it. And it shows you the enthusiasm, and the \u2014\nthis 1s in March of 19 \u2014 or April second of 1938 when Hitler first comes back into\nVienna and \u2014 and the whole town goes berserk. So you have this \u2014 the ab \u2014 the\nunbelievable propaganda machine working with such efficiency and dedication to\nturn the whole culture around. This was the ability that they were able to do. I mean,\nif you go \u2014 you were in an environment where you see all the shoes and all the\nluggage and all the boxcars and \u2014 in your mu \u2014 in the museum. And you say, how do\nthe civilized and \u2014 civilized people do that? And here\u2019s a guy, you know, here\u2019s that\nDecember 2, 2011\n\u2014 that \u2014 that believe this \u2014 this unbelievable corruption of morality and ethics and\nhumanity and everything that we have been taught to believe in as we live on this\nearth, go to pot. So you see that tremendous change that takes place within people\nthat just \u2014 to this very day I don\u2019t quite understand it, how a normal, civilized people\ngo and kill people, or put them into a gas chamber.",
        "Q: The f \u2014 the friends that you were with when you were walking outside, did they\nchange during those months in \u201938? Did \u2014",
        "A: Yes, they did, I\u2019m sure.",

        "A: Though there\u2019s always this emotional exception that people make.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did any one of them actually say something like that to you, or was it a\nsense?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember any of the conversations, because these\ninstances of me walking with them, or talking to my friends, or the ones I went to\nschool with, the \u2014 the \u2014 the occurrence of that were overco \u2014 you know, were really\nDecember 2, 2011\n\u2014 became minor. The \u2014 the major things that \u2014 that one was thinking about was well,\nhow do we get out of here? What do we do, what\u2019s the future? How do I get my\nfather out of Dachau, what has to be done, you know, how are we \u2014 what\u2019s our\nfuture going to be? I can\u2019t go to school any more, or I\u2019m now working for a dentist,\nor \u2014 so he \u2014 your values system takes a dive, and all the things you\u2019ve been taught\njust absolutely disappear.",
        "Q: Do you know why your parents didn\u2019t choose to emigrate when your\ngrandparents emigrated?",
        "A: Well, that was going over the \u2014 because we had applied very early, my \u2014 either\nmy dad or my mom went to the American embassy and put our name on the list.\nAnd then we received an affidavit from relative of ours, that lived in Cincinnati,\nwhom I never met, who sent us an affidavit.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: 1930 \u2014 must have been in 1930 \u2014 the end of \u201937, or to be \u2014 or the first month in \u2014\nor January 1938 that they went to the American embassy and they said well, you\nhave \u2014 you put your name here, on the list, because there\u2019s a waiting list that once\nyou get your affidavit, before, we going to issue visas depending upon when your\nname appeared on this list. So that name didn\u2019t appear on this list until November\nDecember 2, 2011\n1939. That\u2019s our names. And that was \u2014 it had to be very early, before the Nazi\ntakeover of Austria.

        "A: No, no, not Jewish. I hadn't seen him since the end \u2014 since July 1938.",
        "Q: Okay. All right, and \u2014",
        "A: So [ ran into him a year later.",
        "Q: A year later, okay. So \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: Or something like that, you know. June \u2014 had to be June or July. And he asked\nme what was going on, and I started crying, telling him about my dad, we don\u2019t\nknow what to do. And he listened very patiently, and I never will forget him. And he\nsaid to me, you know, I have an \u2014 my uncle is a sturm(ph) something.\nObersturmgon(ph) something fuehrer in the SA. That\u2019s before they got rid of the\nBrownshirts, there were the SS and the SA, they were kind of semi-military. They\ngot rid of some of them, but I think this guy was a very high up in \u2014 he says, I\nDecember 2, 2011\nshould go and come \u2014 he\u2019s gonna see his uncle, and I should go, my mother and I\nshould come and visit.",

        "Q: Not at all.",
        "A: But all these things happened, you know, so fast. I don\u2019t remember very \u2014 you\nknow, I remember the things that happened, but don\u2019t ask me for details.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Cause I \u2014 somehow my mind doesn\u2019t click that way. And I was really bad about\nstre \u2014 cause, you know, I was back in Vienna, looking up people. But anyways, my\nmom and I went to see his uncle. He had a travel agency. And he said, there are\nways to get out of \u2014 of Austria to go to \u2014 I think I mentioned that, to go to China, to\nShanghai. And he fou \u2014 and he sold some tickets to some Jewish people. And\n[indecipherable] the whole thing, it\u2019s just my mother, you know, were talking. And\nI said to her, listen to this, and when she tells him that we can\u2019t leave, because my\nDecember 2, 2011\nfather is in Dachau, and we\u2019re not gonna leave and leave my father in Dachau. And\nhe said, oh. He says he\u2019s gonna find out who has responsibilities, or who is involved\nwith Dachau. And he was pretty high up in the es \u2014 this hierarchy, the Brownshirts.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t remember his name, right?",
        "A: Beg your pardon \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 remember his name at all.",
        "Q: Ye \u2014 ye \u2014 okay, all right.",
        "A: I just remember what he looked like. And you come back to this \u2014 we met at his\noffice, and my friend was there, and his father, who was a brother to this big shot in\nthe Nazi party. Now, to be a big shot in the Nazi party, you had to be an \u2014 a member\nof the Nazi party for a long time, during the time that it was illegal. So this guy must\nhave been \u2014 for many years been a Nazi, which doesn\u2019t sit very pleasant with us \u2014\npleasantly. So we came back, I think a week or two later, and he found out that if we\ncould go to that \u2014 he found out who has responsibility of the Dachau inmates that\nwere arrested in Vienna, and it\u2019s an SS officer that has a desk at the Metropole\nHotel in first district on Rudolfsplatz(ph) and he was going to make an appointment\nwith \u2014 for my mother to meet this officer, and find out what has to be done, if we\ncould get my father out of camp. He said to us that we, I think, have to show proof\nthat we would leave within a very short time. So where would we go? You know,\nEurope at that time, almost every border was closed. My mother had an ex \u2014 old\nDecember 2, 2011\nboyfriend who was English Jewish person, that she was, I think seeing romantically,\nor just a good friend, before she married. And he was a British officer by this time,\nJewish fellow.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: No. I should. Some are \u2014",
        "Q: No. It\u2019s not a value judgment, I\u2019m just curious.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 they\u2019ll be someplace. I may have to think up these things in my\ndocuments that I haven\u2019t had the energy to kind of go my \u2014 down the basement and\nstart \u2014 we\u2019re getting rid of things, you know, and not fast enough. So, we didn\u2019t \u2014 I\nmean, that \u2014 that developed itself later in Israel, but so he made an appointment\nwith \u2014 for my mother to see this guy at the \u2014 at the headquarters of the Gestapo.",
        "Q: Why did this man help you?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Why did this man help you?",
        "A: Because he was an uncle to my friend that I went to school with. The \u2014 remember\nI met him on the street \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 and he brought me to his uncle.",
        "Q: Pm\u2014 I\u2019m -\u2014I\u2019m asking this kind of bald-faced question because I\u2019m \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: I also think \u2014 know that there was some money passed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We are \u2014 he sold \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m not sure about this, and I can\u2019t really pr \u2014 take \u2014 swore\non it, but I think that my mother bought three tickets on a boat to go to China from\nhim; he had \u2014 he owned a travel agency. So \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure about it, but I think\nthis has something to do with it. So all this conversation took place, and\nappointments were made and \u2014 now let\u2019s see, what did I forget? And there was a\nquestion about getting a visa that was \u2014 visas sold illegally by a embass \u2014 a Chinese\nembassy official who \u2014 who wasn\u2019t supposed to do it, but sold permits to go to\nShanghai from Vienna, and also, it was done out of Germany. So that\u2019s, you\nknow, a number of people, Jewish people landed up in Shanghai, and later found\nout they were \u2014 they \u2014 they sold those to make money, and it was not a policy of the\nChinese government. But the \u2014 they did s-save a number of Jewish families.",
        "Q: Now, 1-1f I\u2014",
        "A: I know two of them here, that lived in Des Moines.",
        "Q: If I understand correctly, this was \u2014 this was probably costing quite a little bit.\nDuring \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and given that your father was incarcerated, and he had, I \u2014\nI\u2019m supposing, lost his job earlier, were there any financial difficulties during these\nmonths?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: For us?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, because my mother still was dishing out money to people who\nhad no money.",
        "Q: Was this through any organization, any charitable organization?",
        "A: It was kind of a unofficial done, you know, that things happened when \u2014 when\npanic strikes, that people find ways of doing things. It was not official. I don\u2019t think\nit was an organization like HIAS or anything like that. Be \u2014 was that somebody had\nre \u2014 a relative in \u2014 in New York, and \u2014 who had money, or was willing to help this\nperson living in Vienna who had no money. So they would say if \u2014 if the official\nexchange of marks \u2014 used to be shillings and then it became German marks, was\nfive marks to the d \u2014 10 marks to the dollar \u2014 I\u2019ve forgotten what the exchange rate\nwas, the black market would pay 20 marks to a person in \u2014 1n Vienna, instead of 10.\nSo it paid for the relative to deal to that black market, or whatever it was called, to\nthat conduit. And so if you had money and you lived in Vienna, and you \u2014 there\nwere Jewish people who had no money, and they need to buy groceries. And they\nhad relatives that would give \u2014 who would contribute some money. So that\u2019s why I\nthink \u2014 where the money flow went, back and forth.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re suspecting that perhaps there were some family\nmembers in the United States that were helping?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not much \u2014 some stuck and some didn\u2019t. So it\u2019s \u2014 our parents lost quite a bit of \u2014\nmy parents lost quite a bit of money in the transactions, I guess. So, where was I?",
        "Q: So the \u2014 the uncle of your friend \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 made an appointment for you.",
        "A: Oh, she made appointment, and he sold three sh \u2014 steamship tickets, so that\u2019s\nhow he made money, to my mother to go to China, once my dad was \u2014 and then we\nhad to get a visa from a Chinese embassy, and I don\u2019t know if that was done or not.\nIt was almost a way of, you know, paying off the guy. So she went through the\nHotel Metropole. I went with her, but I stayed outside, I remember that. And there\nwas a big line-up outside of people waiting. They had people in \u2014 in prison and\ntortured at that building, down in the basement. The building, last time I was in\nVienna it no longer existed, but they did put a monument there, just historically,\nwhat \u2014 that the Gestapo headquarters was there. And my mom was ushered in, after\nwaiting in line for a couple hours or more, and she always described this, she was\nDecember 2, 2011\nvery \u2014 she had a wonderful memory, and one of \u2014 my lawyer here in town 1s a\nfellow named David Bellon(ph) [indecipherable] he was also on the Warren\nCommission, and very \u2014 became very prominent nationally, you know\n[indecipherable]. Unfortunately, he died, but was also a close friend of mine. And\nhe heard my mother\u2019s story and \u2014 and he wanted to record \u2014 record that part where\nshe told the details of her visit at the Gestapo, with the black uniform, and the heil\nHitlers and the \u2014 and everybody was throwing out their arm, and you know, heil\nHitler, and it \u2014 and clicking their heels, and she went to \u2014 so finally met the guy,\nand the guy interviewed for about two hours, and then asked her to come back, she\ncame \u2014 we went back, same old thing and he said to her, he would release my father.\nThere was no money exchanged at all, and it was on the \u2014 really on the push of my\nfriend\u2019s uncle, who was a friend of this Gestapo guy. And he would come out in\nabout two weeks, three weeks. And he \u2014 she has to bring him to meet \u2014 to meet \u2014 he\nwanted to meet my dad.",

        "Q: The uncle of your friend, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, the Gestapo.",
        "Q: The Gestapo.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yeah. And she says to Gestapo officer, why do you want to meet my husband?\nHe sees enough of black uniforms in Dachau. And he \u2014 he said, I want to know\nwhat kind of a man marries such a woman like you. So she always told that story,\nwhat the Gestapo officer \u2014 you know, she was a gutsy lady and she was very\narticulate and was able to convince this guy. So, sure enough, my dad come out \u2014",
        "Q: What month is this?",
        "A: It had to be, I would guess July, August, maybe later, September. I can\u2019t\nremember, I have to go really \u2014",
        "Q: But we\u2019re in 19 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and find \u2014 I have papers like that, 1t was sometimes in 1939.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The war started September first. And he was really \u2014 I don\u2019t think he was ever\nthe same. He never wanted to talk about it. He had \u2014 never wanted to go on vacation,\nhe never wanted \u2014 he wanted to work. He had guilt feelings, survivor\u2019s kind of why\nwas he had the privilege of getting out of Dachau, and other people died there. That\nbothered him a great, great deal. So he had these \u2014 which was not uncommon type of\nDecember 2, 2011\nguilt feelings, of been able to have got out, wh-when he \u2014 people that he knew never\nmade it out of there.",

        "A: Yes, Geringer, Josef \u2014 you \u2014 Josef Geringer then became concertmaster at the\nMetropolitan Opera in New York. Hake \u2014 he was in there with my dad. And Irving\nwas one of my very closest friends, he went to si\u2014 he was one class \u2014 he was one\nclass higher in the same gymnasium I went to, and his brother was in my class, I\nthink [indecipherable] two classes or one class, I don\u2019t quite remember. And he \u2014\nI\u2019m just gonna give you a sideline. I was taking basic \u2014 infantry basic training in\nCamp Croft in 1943. And I was assigned to a group of people they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with. I think our I.Q. had something to do with it, and not being a citizen,\nI was just in this country four years, and I was in there with people that were much\nsmarter than me, that \u2014 some of them older, substantial, were all born not in the\nDecember 2, 2011\nUnited States. And people in the music business who escaped out of Germany and\nAustria. Zero Mostel was in my barracks, you remember him?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Who he was?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. And so I\u2019m sitting outside one day after whatever training I went through\nthat day, and I became an infantry \u2014 I became a machine gun \u2014 what the \u2014 rifleman\nand machine gun. That was my spec. I see this guy looks familiar walking across the\ncommon and I recognize, oh my God, that\u2019s Irving Geringer. I si \u2014 hollered at him,\nIrving, Irving, is that you? Sure enough he turns around, it\u2019s him. He \u2014 he was a\nbrilliant guy; I think his I.Q. must have been 160 or so, and they put him as the\nhistorical section for the Fifth Army. So we landed \u2014 we move \u2014 when we are\nshipped overseas into North Africa and then into Italy, he also got shipped over,\nand he ran the historic section for the Fifth Army, so he wrote a book about the\ncampaign. So everywhere I was, he showed up. He had that freedom. And we were\nalmost inseparable during our army days. No matter where we went, he always\nfound me.",
        "Q: An-And you have said that Irving had been incarcerated?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Irving, unfortunately he died. He later became editor of the \u201cSaturday Review\nof Literature,\u201d and his father was the concertmaster for the orchestra at the\nMetropolitan Opera.",
        "Q: And had they both been incarcerated in Dachau?",
        "A: No, no, no, just his dad.",
        "Q: Just his father.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 ha \u2014",
        "A: And when they \u2014 they lur \u2014 moved \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know much about New\nYork City, but when they came to the United States, he immediately, you know, he\nwas well-known; didn\u2019t have a pr \u2014 his father. And they lived on Gramercy Park,\nwhich is like 23rd Street and Fifth Ave. \u2014 23\u2019 \u2014 Second Avenue in New York\nCity. And I spent a lot of time with them when I came out of the army. He had a\nsister who lives in Washington, and I think a brother in Saint Louis. He died,\nunfortunately, my friend. And he wrote the book about the campaign in Italy. So,\nthe \u2014 and his dad \u2014 well, why do I mention it? Because his dad also was arrested and\nwas \u2014 spent time, and they got him out also. Somebody in the music business, and\nfamous within the \u2014 in the ar \u2014 with the \u2014 I think with the administration that time,\nDecember 2, 2011\nthe [indecipherable] administration in Vienna, because he was well-known as a\nmusician, you know, and the executive \u2014 okay, where were we?",
        "Q: Well, you said that your father then had been incarcerated for about 10 months,\nright?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: This would have been early November through the summer.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Was there \u2014",
        "A: Or maybe 10 \u2014 nine months.",
        "Q: Nine, 10 months. Was there any communication from him, aside from that one\npostcard?",
        "A: There wa \u2014 there was what?",
        "Q: Was there any communication with him aside from that one postcard?",
        "A: No. There was po \u2014 a repetition of the postcards.",
        "Q: How frequently, how many\u201d?",
        "A: That I can\u2019t reve \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay, then let\u2019s go back to \u2014 to th-the \u2014 the chronology of the story. So this\nGestapo man told your mother that he would like to see her husband once he 1s out,\nand then \u2014 then what happens?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yes. Well, then we received \u2014 now, I think it was afore we received that we\u2019re\nsupposed to go to China. And we received a police permit to \u2014 and I don\u2019t know\nwas four weeks or six weeks to prepare us to leave.",
        "Q: But did they release your father immediately?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did they release your father immediately? How \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, my father came out.",
        "Q: Was it only a few days between the meeting, or weeks, or \u2014",
        "A: A few days between \u2014 no \u2014",
        "Q: Between your mother\u2019s meeting with the Gestapo officer.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, he came out. It took several weeks, I think, or \u2014 maybe several\nweeks, maybe two weeks for my father to \u2014 to come out from Dachau. And she took\nhim up to meet that officer. So she made three visits to this SS guy at the Metropole\nHotel. And we received \u2014 we told \u2014 we were told that we had to leave within four\nweeks. And we had those steamship tickets and permits to go to Shanghai. We\ndidn\u2019t want to go to Shanghai \u2014 it\u2019s just not me, but my parents. And she \u2014 my\nfather went every four weeks to get an extension of this permit to stay. Waiting for \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011\nmy mother knew \u2014 pretty much guessed when we possibly \u2014 our visa number would\ncome up to go to United States. So we didn\u2019t use those tickets to \u2014 steamship\ntickets. I don\u2019t think we did anything with it. I\u2019m not sure whether we bought them\nor didn\u2019t buy them, and I u \u2014 I-I just can\u2019t remember. I wish my mother were alive,\nand she would probably really tell the story much better than I can.",
        "Q: You're telling it very well.",
        "A: [indecipherable] pretty \u2014 pretty much out of \u2014 you\u2019re out of \u2014 you know, out of\nsi\u2014 you know, she \u2014 there was a lot of things happening that I \u2014 you know, 15 years\nold, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I was a little bit out of sync.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And so we \u2014 we lived from month to month, getting a permit from the police\ndepartment, and \u2014 which I remember the police department, or the police station,\nbecause I went back there as a soldier, I looked them up. And it was until \u2014 we\nstayed there \u2014 the war started September first, and we\u2019re still in Vienna, and things\ngot to be worse. I think they began to issue us permits to buy food. Now what would\nI call it, I forgot now, I can\u2019t get \u2014 put my name on it. Oh, ration cards. And so \u2014 oh,\nand we got an order to \u2014 we must leave our apartment.",
        "Q: When was that?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: It had to be in September or October. Things were really heating up, they ge-\ngetting worse. The Nazi takeover of Jewish businesses was going on and \u2014 much,\nmuch more ra-rapidly. Less and less Jewish business existed, you know, with graffiti\non their windows, they were all taken over. People lost their fortunes. Rich people\nwere able to get out very early, the Rothschilds, and whoever they all \u2014 the other\npeople were, the Blochs(ph) and so on. And they took over their palaces and their\nfacilities and confiscated most of their wealth and paintings, and I \u2014 really got tough.\nAnd in the meantime my dad would go out to the police, get an extension. And we\nwould go pretty often to \u2014 not I, but mom and dad \u2014 to the American embassy to\nfind out where we were on that list. It looked more and more that we had a chance to\nreally go to America. And finally, our visa came \u2014 not visa, but our number came\nup, and we were able to get the visa in November to departure in that wa \u2014 I think it\ncame up in October, for us to leave in November. We packed up one container with\npersonal things. I took my three-speed bike, my so-soccer ball, and my skis.",
        "Q: And this was already from another location, cause you had to \u2014 had to leave your\nhome, is that correct?",
        "A: Yes, everything \u2014 oh, yes, we were moved out to where we li \u2014 from our\napartment, somebody else took it over, a Nazi member. And we moved \u2014",
        "Q: Was there any compensation?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 in with \u2014 yes, into a \u2014 which they had planned to make it a ghetto in second\ndistrict, and we moved in \u2014 now I don\u2019t quite remember, I think one family or two\nfamilies which \u2014 whom we \u2014 Jewish families. And one of the families \u2014 so\neverybody had a bedroom, we shared a living room and a kitchen. And one of them,\nI found out with the lady, because she was beautiful, and she was an actress, with\nher husband with her. And she was a \u2014 on the cover of \u201cDie Buhne,\u201d the stage, a\nfamous theatrical magazine.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No. I wish I did. You know, it\u2019s so \u2014 as I look back, our \u2014 psychologically and \u2014\nand I would guess no matter what, it was so important that our lives, you know,\nwere at constant danger. And si \u2014 never did I ever have the desire to start \u2014 we put\ntogether \u2014 some people did, I just didn\u2019t, and my parents did \u2014 didn\u2019t. We want to\nget rid of this whole history, and we should have really kept so many things that\nwould have been very valuable today, to create my story. And it really \u2014 I just want\nto get out, and the less I had \u2014 I was more interested in my soccer ball and my\nbicycle and my skis than anything else.",
        "Q: Now it \u2014 it\u2019s interesting that your \u2014 your \u2014 describing this as \u2014",
        "A: We had one \u2014 they let us take out one container.",
        "Q: Yeah?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You\u2019re describing this as a \u2014 as a\u2014 as a period where the priority was to get out.\nBut it\u2019s interesting to me that you\u2019re saying that your parents pretty much turned\ndown the opportunity to go to Shanghai. So it was \u2014 they wanted to get out, but it\nwas still a priority to get out \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to the United States.",
        "A: But you know, nobody knew what was going to ha \u2014 nobody could have\nimagined, or perceived the \u2014 what the Nazis were going to do.",
        "Q: Certainly.",
        "A: It wa \u2014 it just \u2014 you know, your mind did not grasp the evil, or grasp this \u2014 these\npeople would have gas chambers and put thousands of people to death. It \u2014 your\nmind and your culture and your upbringing did not perceive that kind of crime. It\nwas just not \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it just couldn\u2019t happen.",
        "Q: Was your fam \u2014",
        "A: Until it happened.",
        "Q: Was your family offered any kind of monetary compensation for the seizure of\nthe apartment?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: So you had to \u2014 you had to move into this other location.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Can you tell me again where that was?",
        "A: Second district, Leopold str \u2014 Leopold something. Leopoldsdorf(ph)? Second\ndist \u2014 there are 21 districts in Vienna, this was the second district, not far from\nwhere we lived before.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And \u2014 and you had to share this \u2014",
        "A: Was not very far from where my an \u2014 aunt and uncle lived.",
        "Q: And you had to share these quarters with two other families, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, that was their plan, to build a ghetto in \u2014",
        "Q: And how long \u2014 how long did you stay there?",
        "A: Not very long. Two months? A month, six weeks. And I\u2019m guessing at the time\nframe.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: And then we got \u2014 the visas showed up, and we packed a\u2014 we got a \u2014 a shipping\nagent company that would ship our stuff out. And what \u2014 they let us take one\ncontainer out, a big container. And that\u2019s what I put my stuff in, and some of my\nparents\u2019 dishes, and whatever they \u2014 you know, they felt was valuable, and \u2014 to start\na new life. And we left \u2014 I \u2014 it had to be the first week in November, 1939. The war\nDecember 2, 2011\nstarted September first, so the Nazis or the Germans, Austrians were happy with all\nthe conquests they were making at that particular time. So they didn\u2019t have time for\nus at that si \u2014 I don\u2019t think, to worry about what we took out, or who we were. They\nwere \u2014 they were glorifying themselves and you know, they were chasing the British\nthrough the English channel, to Dunkirk. And taken over at that time Belgium and\n\u2014 and Holland.",
        "Q: So how \u2014 I\u2014 can you \u2014 can you tell me a bit how you got out of Austria and\nGermany, did you take a train first?",
        "A: Yes, we took a train to Trieste.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we took a ship, was a luxury ship called Saturnia, was an Italian ship. It\nwas all lit up because of all the U-boats. And Italy at that time was not in the war. It\ndeclared \u2014 they went on the side of Germany, I think, three or four months later, or\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t remember. And we went on this very beautiful ship, I \u2014 it\nwas very luxurious, except that they put \u2014 I stayed with my dad in a cabin, and my\nmom was with other women. And there were \u2014 there are other, one or two other\nwomen, and they overburdened the ship. In other words, to try to put the \u2014 put as\nmany people on it as they could, many of whom were refugees like us. And we\nlanded in New York in November, I don\u2019t remember the date. And my \u2014 our\nDecember 2, 2011\nrelatives were at the dock. I never forgotten, never, that in \u2014 I was always thankful\nthat the ship did not dock. It stayed outside the harbor in New York City. And\nEurope at that time was in [indecipherable] blacked out. Couldn\u2019t think of it. There\nwere no lights at night. Cars had no headlights, they had slits on their headlights, and\nit was \u2014 there were no public, no streetlights, no nothing. The war was on, they were\nalways afraid of bombings, so every light at night at \u2014 wherever it was, whether it\nwas Berlin or Vienna or anyplace else, were totally, totally blacked out. And a ship\ndocked, came there in the evening of whatever that date was in November, and it\ndocked on the other side that later became the Verrazano bridge. And you saw the\ntip of Manhattan, the skyscrapers or the tip, the Woolworth buildings and \u2014 all lit\nup. It was totally disbelief. I stood out there on the dock and it was cold, and seeing\nNew York City all lit up; it was unbelievable. And next morning we passed the\nStatue of Liberty, I shall never forget that. It was the most glorifying day of my\nlife, and I became an American overnight, emotionally, at that particular time. I \u2014 so\nwe landed in New York, and we moved in with our friends who were \u2014 lived in the\nsame building in Vienna, who got and had many relatives, cousins and brothers and\nsisters lived in New York. And Schultzenberg(ph) the name was, in Brooklyn. We\nlived with them for about a month or two, and I think maybe six weeks. I\nimmediately went into high school. I went to boys \u2014 in Brooklyn, there was boys\u2019\nDecember 2, 2011\nschool called \u2014 what was it called? He \u2014 Alexander Hamilton High. And I think \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t quite remember if I went in as a sophomore, I think, or as junior.",
        "Q: Now, you didn\u2019t speak any English before you arrived, is that right?",
        "A: Very little. I took two years of English in gymnasium, but my \u2014 th-the most\ncomplicated book I read was \u201cMy Bonnie Flies Over the Ocean.\u201d",
        "Q: Was that a book?",
        "A: Yes, was a book, a children\u2019s book. And \u2014 and really my English was no, no \u2014\nunbelievably limited, and I was, as I \u2014 I never forget, they introduced in in assembly\nat \u2014 at the Alexander Hamilton High, who \u2014 which was later \u2014 now it\u2019s called Paul\nRobeson High. And at \u2014 at the \u2014 in the auditorium, on the stage, I think I wore\nknickers. And they\u2019d never seen somebody like me. And I had a teacher, a English\nteacher I shall never forget, Miss Rossman(ph), who stayed with me after school,\ntaught me how to pronounce the Hs.",
        "Q: The Hs.",
        "A: Yeah, the Hs. The. It is a foreign sound in German. And also, I was determined\nto be an American. Three \u2014 I went there for just one term, and then my parents got\nan apartment on the Lower East Side of New York. My father started \u2014 took the\n[indecipherable] my mom took two \u2014 two \u2014 do you know anything about New\nYork City?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: A little.",
        "A: A little, okay. So we were \u2014 got an apartment. And I don\u2019t remember the name of\nthe \u2014 I \u2014I va \u2014I think [ll think of the name of the street. And my dad decided he\u2019s \u2014\nwe need to make money, we need to make a living, we need to be in business, so we\nneed to do something. We don\u2019t want to depend upon anybody, this is no\nunemployment, this was nothing. We had no ways of getting any help from anyone.\nAnd what little money they \u2014 we were able to transport out at these exchanges, you\nknow, that took place over a couple of years, so we had some money in a bank\naccount. He went to Orchard Street which is kind of \u2014 used to be a wholesale\nplaces, it\u2019s right, but now it\u2019s kind of a san \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a bargain street in new ye \u2014\nin the Lower East Side of New York, and they found a wholesaler of socks, men\u2019s\nsocks, and he filled up a suitcase, my parents [indecipherable] black and brown and\nwhite and by men\u2019s socks, on one suitcase. And then my dad found sections in New\nYork, the Lower East Side where people spoke either German or Yiddish, and\ncould understand him. And he knocked on doors and he peddled. And he never came\nhome until \u2014 until the suitcase was empty. And peddled those socks. He would ask\nhim, do s \u2014 you know, yeveten(ph) Yiddish, you can speak Yiddish, as he knocked\non the door. Most people could, you know, a lot of Jewish sections in the Lower\nEast Side of New York. A lot of places in Brooklyn, and he would sell those socks.\nDecember 2, 2011\nAnd then, first money they were able to accumulate, they opened up a little grocery\nstore on East Church Street at Avenue C.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: Had to be 1940 \u2014 40. I went \u2014 transferred to Seward Park High School, and I\nhad a cousin there, my mother\u2019s brother, who had \u2014 they lived in United States for\nlong time, and she grew up. And my cousin at that time is a freshman at CCNY,\nCity College. And he introduced me to all his friends: girlfriends and boyfriends and\nstudents and freshmen, and that\u2019s how I learned. They took me in like I was their\nbrother. And I went to Seward Park High School, and I finished high school in a\ncouple of years, went to CCNY.",
        "Q: Was this a mixed group of friends, Jews, non-Jews?",
        "A: Yes, they were all Jewish, they were all Jewish.",
        "Q: They were all Jewish, mm-hm.",
        "A: All Jews. Yeah, they lived on the Lower East Side. We used to hang out in back\nof a place called Hamilton Fish Library, and they were bright, they were\nundemanding, totally unprejyudiced. I learned English very rapidly. I did well in high\nschool.",
        "Q: Did you ever have to use your German?\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: No. I got rid of ger \u2014 I lost my German, totally. I mean, I spoke it a little bit, but I\n\u2014I could probably speak it again, but I just have not used it, and I don\u2019t want to use\nit. I have no desire to do that. So I wanted to be an American so bad, and wanted to\nbe part of, that for a whole while people never do. When I came to Des Moines \u2014\ntrying to remember what I had when I finished school. I got a job in the textile\nindustry, after I came home from the army, in \u2014 in New York City. And I never,\never let people know that I was born in \u2014 I really had a \u2014 I had a fixation that I\nwanted to be an American and I don\u2019t want to talk about my past in Europe, and I \u2014\nand it was very unpleasant for me, and I tried everything possible to lose my accent.\nI had learned English very rapidly. And it was really a psychological jump to at \u2014\nmy \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141f I wouldn\u2019t tell you today, people here in Des Moines thing well, oh\nFred Lorber, yeah, he\u2019s got that New York accent. So I go back to New York\nCity, which quite often I used to, either five, six times a year, they all even think oh,\nit\u2019s Fred, now got a \u2014 got a Midwestern accent. So, it\u2019s neither. And so e \u2014 I had this\n\u2014 this anks \u2014 was it \u2014 not anxiety, but somehow I wouldn\u2019t tell people I was born in\nEurope, for a long time. And one of the greatest thing happened to me, that I got\ndrafted. And I, it turn out, was in the army for close to three years. And it was the\nbest thing that happened to me, and it really \u2014 it established my self-worth and \u2014 and\nI became an American.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "Q: Let me stop you again right now.",

I mean, these were all, you know, pre-\nprinted letters, so that\u2019s how you were drafted. But that\u2019s when your notice came\nthat you had to report to your local draft board. And I was absolutely delighted,\nbecause many of my friends had left, already been in basic training and went to an\nSA \u2014 ASDP training session, where college students primarily were sent to learn a\nlanguage, or a\u2014 some kind of specialty. So, many of my friends had been \u2014 already\nbeen gone, and I was one of the youngest in the group, so \u2014 and I think they were\nalso pretty bis \u2014 much undecided, the draft board, whether they can draft non-\nDecember 8, 2011\ncitizens. Previously, I think maybe a year before or two years before, the post office\nused to have kind of posters as you walked in to mail your letters, so got a mail \u2014\nmail order, a la \u2014 excuse me, a money order, or anything like that, had a sign up:\nbeware of enemy aliens. And being born in Vienna, Austria, I was, at that time,\nreally considered an enemy alien. That was kind of \u2014",

So, it had to be 1942 when those things\nappeared in the post offices, and other federal offices in New York City. It was\ncreating a little bit of a shock to me, because I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I no longer considered\nmyself an Austrian ail \u2014 an Austrian citizen, because, you know, we were\ndisenfranchised; a very early part of the annexation of Austria to Germany.",

        "A: I was outside, listening to a football \u2014 I was out with friends of mine, and I could\ntell you exactly who it \u2014 where it was, it was av \u2014 in New York City, in the Lower\nEast Side, on Avenue C, between Second and Third Street, on the north side of\naven \u2014 on the north side of Avenue C, and that was in front of a candy store. At that\ntime the hangouts of young people were outside of candy stores. I didn\u2019t know if\nyou knew about that or not, but \u2014",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t. My grandparents owned a candy store, but I did not know that.",
        "A: Okay. So \u2014 and then something came across the radio of an attack on Pearl\nHarbor. Well, Pearl, we \u2014 there used to be some \u2014 number of women and young\ngirls, they were in the Lower East Side, they were called Pearl. And we just didn\u2019t\nknow, as I talked to some of my friends, where was pe \u2014 who was Pearl Harbor\u2019?\nWhere \u2014 or \u2014 there was very little knowledge about it. And came as such a surprise.\nAnd what happened that the broadcast of the New York Giants football game,\nwhich was played at the Polo Grounds at that time, was a ballpark in New York\nCity, and it was interrupted with the news of Japanese bombarding Pearl Harbor,\nin Hawaii.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 on East Church Street, right off the corner of Avenue C, one \u2014 maybe just\none, maybe a half a building. Was on the south side of the street, on East Church\nStreet, and Avenue C, at the corner. And, small store, and no help. It was my dad,\nDecember 8, 2011\nmy mom and I. But I just worked there part time after school. I would help out, or\ndeliver orders into the tenements, there were no elevators at all [indecipherable]\nsteps, you know.

        "Q: Did they have to work very long hours?",
        "A: Yes, we sa \u2014 opened up usually 6:30 in the morning, and closed about 10. No\nhelp.",
        "Q: Any days off?",
        "A: No. There was just my mom \u2014 excuse me, my dad, my mother and I. Well, I had\na very small part, it was just them, those two. But the store was very small. It was \u2014\nI don\u2019t think he could have put another employee in there, it was kind of a \u2014\nelongated and narrow. And we sold all \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a delicatessen \u2014",
        "Q: Do I-",
        "A: \u2014 [indecipherable] and things like that.",
        "Q: Do I remember correctly that your \u2014 your mother had basically been at home in\nAustria, she had not \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 needed to work?",
        "A: Never worked.",
        "Q: How did she handle the transition to working, and working very long hours?\nDecember 8, 2011",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I never really even thought about that, because we came,\nyou know, we were immigrants. We were \u2014 we had to reestablish ourselves. So it\nwas either we did it and everybody worked, or you just \u2014 you became a dependent \u2014\nor even that not being citizen, I don\u2019t know whether or not there was money\navailable, like unemployment or things like that, and I don\u2019t think so. So if you\nwere going to have your self-respect, and made a livi \u2014 you know, knew that you\nhad to make an honest living, you had to go to work. And to get a job, I think my\ndad or my mom would not been able to do that, because they\u2019re very limited on\ntheir English language at that time. And they picked it up, you know, as they start\nworking in the store. And many of their customers were \u2014 were Jewish, and they\nspoke Yiddish. And, it was a very Jewish neighborhood.",
        "Q: So, does that mean that it was relatively easy for them to start their lives here,\nbecause there were so many people they could interact with?",
        "A: No, I think it was very difficult. You worked long hours, which my mother never\nworked in Vienna, you know, we had a very \u2014 well, kind of a comfortable life, and\nmiddle-class. She didn\u2019t \u2014 never had a job. She \u2014 all she did, you know, she was\ncooking and taking care of the house, and took care of me s \u2014 when I was a small\nchild. And my father had a very good job. Worked five days a week. We went away\nDecember 8, 2011\nevery summer, took a place out in the country. So that you \u2014 the quality of life was\nquite substantially better.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: But the key issue though, coming to the United States was the freedom. The\nacceptance of us being foreigners, being Jewish, having just escaped this den of\nanti-Semitism, you know, it \u2014 th-the dilemma of not being a citizen any more, and\nour lives being very, very vulnerable. You know, my dad being \u2014 having been in a\nconcentration camp. So every little thing that we saw in America was a blessing.",

        "A: Yes, I\u2014 and \u2019'm \u2014 I\u2019m kind of an embarrassen \u2014 embarrassed to tell you that.",
        "Q: Oh no.",
        "A: Because I wanted to be an American so bad, and I had all American friends, I\nreally lost contact \u2014 I knew a few people from Vienna, friends, you know, or people\nDecember 8, 2011\nI went to school with, but somehow I lost all contacts, because all my friends were\nAmerican. And I decided I wanted to be an American and I began hiding my\nidentity. In other words, I didn\u2019t tell peop \u2014 once my English got \u2014 1s like it is today,\nvery shortly, I really \u2014 I should tell you my first book report in high school, where\nmy English was absolutely almost nonexistent. And it was \u201cA Tale of Two Cities,\u201d\nby Dickens. And I read it in German, I cut it out of the \u2014 I found the book at the\nlibrary in German and also in English, and I translated it, and I know no English, I\nused an American English dictionary, and an English and a German English\ndictionary and \u2014 to do the book report. At that kind of got \u2014 convinced me, 1n order\nfor me to forget about that I came from Vienna, that I came from Austria, and to be\nan American, just like everybody else, I had to learn English. And before I\ntransferred to Seward Park High School, I went to Alexander Hamilton High in\nBrooklyn for just one semester.",
        "Q: Why did you transfer?",
        "A: When I first \u2014 we first came. I think it was one semester, maybe two, but really\nthink it was one. And I had an English teacher, a \u2014 a \u2014 a woman, it\u2019s just her name\nescapes me right now, but sh \u2014 it\u2019Il come back to me, cause she was indelible in my\nmind, who stayed with me after school maybe two times a week.

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So, that had tremendous impact upon me, and I was determined the only way I\ncan truly be accepted like everybody else, and not be called a refugee, a\n[indecipherable] and they had all kinds of names for people that \u2014 it \u2014 I don\u2019t think\nthat new immigrants were very welcome at that time, even though there were many\nin \u2014 new immigrants, you know, living \u2014 your grandparents or whoever it was, had\ncome from another country.",
        "Q: Sure. Did you \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and they assimilated, but then again, there was a \u2014 there was a resistance\nof the Jewish community, I think, to new people coming in from the occupied\nterritories in Europe.",
        "Q: Did it \u2014 did you feel like it mattered that you had come from Austria, and was \u2014\nwas that an issue for the Jewish community, and had you come from Poland, it\nwould have been different?",
        "A: No. I think \u2014 that\u2019s a good question. I think Austrian \u2014 Austrian Jews were more\nassimilated than the Jews that came from Poland. You know, they came from the\nlittle shtetls, small villages, and that \u2014 we were well educated in Jewish history and\nDecember 8, 2011\nlanguage and \u2014 and probably \u2014 and maybe have learned a lot of language, Polish or\nGerman, particularly where \u2014 it was \u2014 if 1t was worse than Poland, which was part\nof the Hapsburg empire at one time. Still, the American Jews looked down on the\nimmigrants at that particular time. That changed \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: Were there any incidents that you can recall?",
        "A: Yeah, but I think that \u2014 that the \u2014 I come \u2014 come from \u2014 more from a western\npart of Europe, that I was a little different. Many of people who came from\nGermany, Jews who came from Germany, and from Austria and some of the\nwestern countries, settled in upper bra \u2014 on upper Broadway. You know, 68\"\nStreet and up. And that was \u2014 became a very strong Jewish immigrant community,\nand they even had their own newspaper called the auf \u2014 I think it was called the\n\u201cAufbau,\u201d meaning building, again, or you know, building in new community. And\nlot of German speaking businesses existed there. So I had a cousin who was a\nphysician, who could not get into medical school in the United States, and when\nDecember 8, 2011\nthe war ended, he went to Italy to get his medical training. And he later became\nIsaac Bashevis Singer [indecipherable]",

        "Q: A little.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014 and when \u2014 I se \u2014 a little side story, I\u2019ll \u2014 when Isaac Bashevis su \u2014\nSinger received the Nobel prize for literature in Stockholm, he was going to go\nwith him.

        "A: I wanted \u2014 yes, I want \u2014 1-1-in other words, if I understand you correctly, I\nwanted to be an American so badly, so \u2014 I interacted all with Americans, young\npeople. They became my friends, I became their friend.",

        "A: I think immediately, when \u2014 soon as I got \u2014 I was absolutely very vulnerable.\nWhen I moved war \u2014 I took a job in Des Moines. At that time my English \u2014 which\nwas in 19 \u2014 January \u2014 early December of 1949, or fift \u2014 no, it\u2019s really January of\n1950 \u2014 no one knew, including the people who hired me \u2014 that I was just going to\nstay in Des Moines for \u2014 for a couple years. We are \u2014 we were \u2014 we were married\nto an American girl. We had one child, and my wife was pregnant with the second\none, and we moved here, and I never, ever let on that I came from Vienna, Austria.\nDecember 8, 2011\nTo this very day, I think 90 percent people here \u2014 because I became very active in\nthe community, knew that I came from a foreign country. It wasn\u2019t until about 25\nyears ago, or 30 years ago that it \u2014 that it all of a sudden it didn\u2019t matter to me ata \u2014\nagain. I was enough self-confidence that apparently I built. I mean, it\u2019s just like a\nself-analysis, but \u2014 that I felt I\u2014 my ego really wasn\u2019t vulnerable any more.

        "A: But they\u2019re not going to say this \u2014 yeah. Or it was my feeling that I wanted to be\nlike every \u2014 I think if really, if I had some sub \u2014 subconscious motivations, I think\nthat\u2019s probably what it was, to be recognized, and that was just [indecipherable]\nDecember 8, 2011\nlike everybody else.

        "Q: No, I don\u2019t think you need it.",
        "A: I know \u2014 no, I\u2019ve figured out you know, I had the \u2014 a couple of friends of mine\nwho were psychiatrists and \u2014 and I always remember one time we were at a dinner\nand I was sitting next to one of the \u2014 one of the physicians who was very quiet, but\nhe was a \u2014 a therapist. And he turns to me, he says \u2014 and \u2014 and I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m kind of,\nvery social, and he turns to me, he says, you really are \u2014 Fred, you rece \u2014 you\u2019re so\nsocial because you\u2019re really an introvert.",
        "Q: What an insight.\nDecember 8, 2011",
        "A: It shocked me, oh, it sho \u2014 it shocked me.",
        "Q: Do you think he was onto something?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Do you think he was onto something?",
        "A: I think probably I\u2019m overcompensating. I think so. I think that\u2019s what motivated\nme. You know, I took this job and I became president, it was a very \u2014 what do I say,\na very American company, and I became president of the company. Never planned\nit to me. I went to \u2014 then I also bought \u2014 I left the company after I was president and\nbought an interest in another company, and I s-started another company with a\ncouple of immigrants, Russian immigrants, which they still work \u2014 still running\nhere in \u2014 in I \u2014 in Des Moines, now owned by a large syndicate, and has about 300\nemployees. And two Russians were started in business, because I was, at that time I\nthink, president of the Jewish Federation, and I went to the airport to greet two 1m \u2014\nwhen we took at \u2014 every community at that time, took it upon themselves to resettle\nsome Russian Jews that were able to get out of Russia where there was a lot of anti-\nSemitism at that time in the Soviet Union.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what years were these?",
        "A: Ah, it has \u2014 it had to be 1940 \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, 1970 \u2014 \u201973 or \u201974. So what happened\nwas, I went to the airport to greet them, in \u2014 on behalf of the Jewish community,\n100December 8, 2011\ntwo couples. Should I share that with you?",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: Okay. One couple was SteralzesIsky(ph), the other was Ruchstein(ph), they\nwere both engineers. One wife was a physician and the other wife a concert pianist.\nAnd I was taken with them immediately, because I somehow superimposed myself\ninto their situation, I guess: new immigrants, well-educated, talented. And I got\nthem jobs, and \u2014 at a engineering company, they were both engineers, the men. One\nwife was a physician, the other wife a pianist, a \u2014 played at the Kir-Kirov-Kirov \u2014\nKirov Opera Company in Leningrad, at that time, now St. Petersburg. And \u2014\nand I got to be very close to them, because these were the first immigrants we \u2014 that\nthe Jewish community took on upon themselves to settle them. We got them an\napartment, we \u2014 I got them English teachers, and found jobs for them. A friend of\nmine that was president of a steel company here and also was Jewish, I called him\nup and I says, you got \u2014 you know, got to help me. I have these two Russians, they\nvery \u2014 look like very smart engineers, they don\u2019t speak much English, I need jobs\nfor them. So he gave them the jobs. And I got fairly close to them, and my\nassociates at the business that I just was buying 1n, there\u2019s a father and son who\nowned that company, it\u2019s a company that was making quilted nylon fabrics in Des\nMoines and had another plant in Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas. And about six\nDecember 8, 2011\nmonths later, my friend who owned \u2014 excuse me, who was president of steel\ncompany called Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel called me up, he says, I\u2019m not doing\nthese two Russians any favors. I said, why? He said, well, they\u2019re to \u2014 two\nsophisticated engineers, and I should find them other jobs. So I met with them, and\nthey showed me patents, but I couldn\u2019t read them as done in Cyrillic Russian, and \u2014\nbut I could make out their names. So I went to my two partners and I said, why\ndon\u2019t we each put in some money and il \u2014 and \u2014 would \u2014 enough to kind of get a\nlawyer and get \u2014 get their \u2014 get their patents that they had in Russia registered in\nthe United States [indecipherable] on controlling any kind of liquid going through\npipelines, and through compressors and things like that, and they had figured out a\nsystem that would automatically control those compressors. So one thing that they\nmoved into my office, so I learned a little Russian, I listened to Russian music\n[indecipherable] little \u2014 little radios tuned into a Russian \u2014 I don\u2019t know how they\nheck they got the Russian station. So we became very good friends and we got them\ntheir patents and then my three \u2014 two partners and I put in each 25,000 dollars to get\nthem rolling. And that\u2019s when they moved into my office, I kind of forgot about\nthat. So that\u2019s \u2014 after 10 or 12 years of this \u2014",
        "Q: Of them in your office?\n102December 8, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 and it caused a lot of problems and it was a really \u2014 it was a \u2014 it turned out if I\nsucceeded, it was sold, the first company was sold the first time for \u2014 oh, a\ninvestment company in Minneapolis bought 60 percent and I \u2014 I don\u2019t quite\nremember the numbers, but they were like six million dollars \u2014",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: \u2014 that they invested, and then \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want to sell the company, but my\ntwo other partners and \u2014 and now Mr. Ruzelski(ph) then became president, and he\nwanted to buy \u2014 he wanted \u2014 he had gotten a condo in [indecipherable] they had\nthe beautiful home in Palisades in New York, and \u2014 and Kahn(ph) was the other\none, in par \u2014 I mean, in \u2014 1n France. So we sold the company the first time at I\nthink about 25 million dollars.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So then it was \u2014 we got it back \u2014 it was a whole nars \u2014 it \u2014 it deserves another\nbook.",
        "Q: Okay. Did the Russians stay in your office for 10 years?",
        "A: So \u2014 yeah, anyways \u2014 anyways, yeah, the company is owned by a conglomerate,\nand we still \u2014 I think we still employ about 250 or 300 people here in Des Moines.",
        "Q: Oh, goodness.",
        "A: So, it was really a \u2014 the Russians are out.\n103December 8, 2011",
        "Q: The Russians are out?",
        "A: They\u2019re all sold out, yes. Even \u2014 [ll tell you who was our sales manager for a\nwhile, Shevalski(ph).",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: You know who sh \u2014 sh \u2014 you know who the Shevalskis(ph) are, that\u2019s the\nbrother of the Israeli Shevanksi(ph) \u2014 Shevanski(ph). So I got involved with the\nRussian community. We brought a lot of Russians into Des Moines at that time.\nNow the company may have three or four Russians left, that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: Now when \u2014 when \u2014 when \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s another story we could probably write.",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when you helped those two families come here in the early 70s, was\n\u2014 was that the first time you were helping refugees from Europe after the war, or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So in the immediate postwar period, you were not \u2014 you were not part of any\nkind of communities who were \u2014 who were either placing refugees, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, no, we were busy establishing ourselves.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And both, you know, commercially, or financially, or emotionally or\npsychologically.\n104\nDecember 8, 2011",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t think my parents ever really assimilated, and they sold \u2014 they \u2014 they\ngot into a bigger store, and then another bigger store and they finally sold out, and\nthey retired, and moved into Brooklyn, on eastern \u2014 not Eastern Parkway, Ocean\nParkway. | used to go and go visit them. And my father couldn\u2019t stand retiring, so\nthey bought a little business in kind of a market on \u2014 selling haberdashery. And it\ngot held up one time, and the guy left him bloody and unconscious on the floor. I\nflew into New York at that time. I used to go to New York about four or five times\non business every year. And \u2014 and then I flew in for that, and my dad was in the\nhospital, and at that time I sold up \u2014 I went and sold th-their business, I would not\nlet him go back.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what year was this \u2014",
        "A: So he retired \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 how old was he at the time?",
        "A: That had to be, I don\u2019t know, 60s, or 70s, late 60s.",
        "Q: So he would have been around 70 by then?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see. I just celebrated my 88\" birthday, so that had to be \u2014 I was in my\n60s, probably. Had to be, yeah, yeah, I was still young. I was still flying all over the\ncountry. So I\u2014 and you know \u2014 and I\u2019m trying to remember whether I was still\n105\nDecember 8, 2011\nworking for ya \u2014 my other company, was president, or was my new company. So I\ng \u2014I have to go back and talk to my wife about that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, let\u2019s go back to the years \u00b041 and 42. When \u2014 when did you get your\ncitizenship?",
        "A: Four \u2014 exactly? 1940 \u2014 I was drafted 19 \u2014 the war started 1941 - \u201942. I went in\nthe army in \u00b043. Okay, 1943.",
        "Q: That is when you got your citizenship?",
        "A: Yes, I wa \u2014I was in \u2014 I was finish basic training in Camp Croft, South\nCarolina.",
        "Q: In basic training, did you \u2014 I \u2014 1 \u2014I-\u2014I\u2019d like to get a \u2014 a better picture of you as\na young man. Were you \u2014 were you a \u2014 a sporty type? Wa-Was this a hard thing for\nyou to go through, basic training?",
        "A: Yes. It wasn\u2019t hard, no, I hated it.",
        "Q: Why did you hate it?",
        "A: I hated bayonet training, I hated sleeping in a ditch. I \u2014 I trained as an infantry, I\nhad a [indecipherable] 745, which was my [indecipherable] rifleman and machine\ngunner. Zero Mostel, you know, who he was?\n106\nDecember 8, 2011",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: He was in my barracks.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: He hated it worse than I did. I used to do his field packs and help him, because\nhe really was like \u2014 there\u2019s a Jewish expression, like a laymach(ph). That was he\nwas very \u2014 not very coordinated, believe it or not, at that time. He was heavy\noverweight, and everything was a joke with him. So, we remained friends, I mean,\nsomewhat, I didn\u2019t see him very often. I \u2014 every time I \u2014 when I go to New York I\nwould look him up if he was in a play. So, it was a \u2014 but the basic training that I\ntook was in vi \u2014 but it \u2014 many of the people in my company were foreign born.\nThey had \u2014 they didn\u2019t know what to do with us. So, we all took basic training, and\nmany of the \u2014 many of the people were older than I was. I was, you know, I was\nfairly young, and had a great education, or had special talents. And I remember\ndoing KP.",
        "Q: What is that?",
        "A: Kitchen \u2014 kitchen duty, you know. Every so often you had to help out in the\nkitchen. Hated it. You know, peel potatoes and things like that for the rest of the \u2014",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what did you hate about it? Was it the discomfort? Did you feel that it\nwas pointless \u2014\n107December 8, 2011",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hate it, I loved the army.",
        "Q: Oh you \u2014 but you hated the basic training.",
        "A: Yeah, it was, you know, being that I was tired all the time, and I slept in \u2014 in\nfoxholes. They taught us \u2014 and I was in the infantry, which is \u2014 that\u2019s the one they\ndo all the fighting. So there \u2014 you know, these are the people that are in combat\npositions. So I tell you, one day I\u2019m sitting outside after a hard day of training, and I\nwas sitting in a common disc \u2014 ara \u2014 area which 1s called the common. You know,\nin front of the barracks, and it must have been summer. And I look up and I see a\nguy, boy that looks familiar. Oh my God, can it be? Someone that was in the same\ngymnasium or the same school in Vienna \u2014",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: \u2014 that I was. Name was Irving Geringer, and I holler, Irving, Irving. He turns\naround, it was him. And he and his brother were \u2014 didn\u2019t live far from us. His father\nwas a first violinist at the Vienna Philharmonic before the Nazis came, and Irving\nwas extremely smart, I remember him in gymnasium. He was born a year ahead of\nme and \u2014 but he was a very smart student, like, you know, like a four point. And \u2014\nand I saw \u2014 I was so startled, you know, to meet someone from my gymnasium, my\nhigh school in Vienna, same company. And we spent men \u2014 much of our army time\ntogether. He \u2014 he had a very high I.Q., and he became [indecipherable] he was \u2014\n108December 8, 2011\nreally did the job, did most of the work. He worked with one major, it\u2019s an officer,\nto write the story of the campaign, of the Italian campaign, because he and I both\nlanded up in North Africa, and then on in Italy. And I spent all my \u2014 year of my \u2014\nthe war years in Italy. And he wrote a b \u2014 he wrote the official book of the\ncampaign, which is in Library of Congress, and I looked it up one day. And he and I\n\u2014 wherever I was, Irving had this freedom to travel throughout the \u2014 the war area,\nbecause he was doing all this \u2014 this all historic writing \u2014",
        "Q: He \u2014 he \u2014 he was doing that during what time?",
        "A: \u2014 and he would look and hound me everyplace I went.",
        "Q: Th-This was after the war ended, 1s that right?",
        "A: No, that was during the war.",
        "Q: It was during the war?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so \u2014 so he had been recruited for his \u2014 his writing talents, into a special \u2014 he\nhad some sort of special position?",
        "A: Yes, yes, but he was much smarter, he had a high \u2014 much higher I.Q. than I did.",
        "Q: Did you get an I.Q. test?",
        "A: Yeah, I did.",
        "Q: Did they give you one at the \u2014 in the army?\n109December 8, 2011",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019ve got an L.Q. test. I \u2014 there wasn\u2019t as \u2014 I thought I was much smarter than\nwhat the test [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you and Irving speak German or English to each other?",
        "A: No, we talked English only.",
        "Q: So Irving was \u2014",
        "A: And we kept our friendship right through the war, and we were very close while\nwe lived in New York. His father became the concertmaster at the \u2014 which is the\nfirst chair in the orchestra \u2014 at the Metropolitan Opera Company. And so we went to\nthe opera very often, for free. And became kind of a steady guy at the Metropolitan\nOpera \u2014 that\u2019s when they were still down on 1407, which is 1407 Broadway, and\nthen they moved uptown to Lincoln Center, and we did \u2014 I still remember going,\nhow amazed we were [indecipherable] opera company, Irving and I did. We were\n\u2014 became very good fre \u2014 I gotta tell you a quick anec \u2014 ac \u2014 anecdote. Not\nanecdote, thing that happened to him and me. When the war ended, I moved up\nfrom Italy into \u2014 of \u2014 U-USF \u2014 US \u2014 US force \u2014 USFA. US Forces in Austria.\nThey apparently went through my \u2014 through, you know, my \u2014 every G.I. had that\nIBM card. I didn\u2019t have it, but they had it. We traveled with trucks 1n the wors \u2014 in\nworse environments, that had the first machines, IBM cards, they were \u2014 had holes\nin them. And they had these machines in the trucks, they\u2019re big, big \u2014 they were\nDecember 8, 2011\nvery big semis. And \u2014 and you \u2014 all your \u2014 your record and who you are, your\nnames, your schooling, your I.Q., whatever you did, was on that one card, it had\nholes in it. So if they want to pull the \u2014 that the army wanted to pull you up, because\nlooking for certain specialties that people may have, they would somehow run these\ncards through these machines, and itll come up. So, when the war ended, my outfit\nwas moved \u2014 was going to be moved back to the States, but then they redirected it\nto Japan \u2014 not to Japan, but to the Pacific. So, I got pulled out, and I always\nwondered how \u2014 why didn\u2019t I go with my outfit? So apparently my Viennese birth\nand my German knowledge, I landed up in US Forces in Austria, on the mar \u2014 on\nthe [indecipherable]. Then, he was the commanding general of the campaign in \u2014\nin Italy, that went from the bottom of the boot all the way up to the Po River,\nwhere I served all my military overseas. So then my friend Irving wrote the book\nabout the campaign, the Italian campaign. So, I-I find myself pulled out and sent to\na staging area and then I get orders that I am now part of USFA ma \u2014 US Forces in\nAustria. So I am the only really Viennese person in a contingent of about 200 - 300\nG.L.s that will make the invasion back in \u2014 not invasion, but because the Russians\ngot there before us, but reoccupation of Vienna. I \u2014 did I tell you that yet?",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure whether it was part of the recording, but I certainly knew that as a\npart of your story \u2014\n111December 8, 2011",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and I do want to hear more about that, but I think we\u2019re ahead of ourselves. So",
        "A: Okay, Ill go back.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back to 1943, and your basic training and your time, before you get\nshipped out; did you ever feel any hostility because you were foreign born?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel \u2014",
        "A: In fact, one day \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: \u2014I got called to the orderly room. And the first sergeant 1s tell me that recent\ntelegram to me. He said he has a request from \u2014 order from Hapsburg\n[indecipherable] of K-Kaiser Franz Joseph from Austria, that they starting an\nAustrian battalion, part of the US Army, or the \u2014 their allies, that they want me to\njoin to go to become part of the Austrian \u2014 I was Austrian battalion, you know,\ncombat battalion. I was so shocked when they read that to me and asked me if I\nwant to go, and I said absolutely not, I\u2019m an American and I want to stay here and I\nwant to train here and I want to stay in the American army. I have no desire to fight\nfor the Austrians.\n112December 8, 2011",
        "Q: You were already a citizen when you got that \u2014 when you got that \u2014",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: Not yet, okay.",
        "A: \u2014I was not a citizen. I was just here four years.",

        "A: So, you want to hear what happened?",
        "Q: Definitely.",
        "A: So I\u2019m getting sh \u2014 now we get orders to ship out. I now get assigned to overseas\nreplacement, no outfit, but the \u2014 I was called a \u2014 a replacement, going to a repo\ndepot. That was like where you waited, and then, for example, the third division, or\nthe 45\" or 36\", that was \u2014 is a fighting position in Italy. When they had casualties\nthey would put in a request for replacements. So that\u2019s what I was trained to be, a\nreplacement. So, on the way, to figure out that we\u2019re going overseas, from\nHampton Roads, Virginia, they find out I\u2019m not a citizen, the army. So they take\nme in Pennsylvania \u2014 we were a staging area, Camp Shenango, | still remember\nthat. And they find a federal judge \u2014 I\u2019m only in this country four years and to be a\ncitizen you have to be here five years, to be naturalized. And they convince a judge\nthat I have to ship overseas, and they need me overseas and I\u2019ve been trained, to\n113December 8, 2011\nmake me a citizen. So, I think I\u2019m the only citizen in the United States that kind of\ndid it in four years, rather than this 1s required five years.",
        "Q: It was advanced placement.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: It was advanced placement.",
        "A: Yeah, whatever it was. So, I can\u2019t \u2014 I became a citizen.

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t care. I just couldn\u2019t wait. What a way to get even. What was what \u2014\nyou know, what an opportunity, to become part of the American milieu and the\nAmerican army, finally, you know, nobody\u2019s going to question my citizenship, so\nnobody\u2019s going to question who I am, because now I\u2019m serving in the American\narmy, and I\u2019m fighting for \u2014 for our existence and to bring democracy back.",

We\u2019re\nvery close. We really for a while were \u2014 were able to stay together, and never has\nthere ever been a question of my religion, or of being Jewish or not, for some\nreason. Maybe I assimilated well, I don\u2019t know, but I think that maybe had\nsomething to do with it. I found two of my cousins that came from Vienna. This is\nmy cell phone.

And so,\n117December 8, 2011\nbecause it\u2019s casualty rate was pretty high at that time. So \u2014 and we didn\u2019t know very\nmuch.

        "Q: It was \u2014 it was in the daytime that you were so \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And it was fantastic. We had just finished and one \u2014 chased the\nGermans out of Sicily, and now we\u2019re getting ready to march up, or to \u2014 to chase\nthem out of Italy, you know, the boot, we\u2019re at the bottom of the boot. So I\u2014",

        "Q: Was that a disappointment?",
        "A: Well, kind of a mixed feeling. Number one, I \u2014 you know, I did experience a\nlittle bit of combat, but not as much as I should have. I got \u2014 we got stuck before, at\nthe Rapido River, which was in southern Italy, and at a place called Cassino,\nwhich was an abbey on top of a mountain, that the Germans has put big guns on it\nand we couldn\u2019t get across the Rapido River. I got in too late into Anzio, which is a\nbeach, was an attack trying to circumvent the uk \u2014 the [indecipherable] way\nbecause it was muddy and \u2014 and very difficult, and Germans had really great\npositions on it. So, it was great, I had \u2014 I was \u2014 I went from Naples, as we\nconquered territories up to Rome, from Rome to Venice \u2014 not, sorry, from Rome to\nFlorence, and from Florence to the heck \u2014 over on the Adriatic, I\u2019ve forgotten the\nname of the town.

        "A: Yes. There were friendships \u2014 not friendships, no. And that\u2019s what bothered me\nsomewhat, and I think maybe I had an extraordinary sensitivity to that. The\nGermans \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the Italians were \u2014 the G.Is called them guineas or wops.\nThey called the Germans krauts, they called the French, the frogs, and I \u2014 bothered\nme a great deal. It was insulting. And I always wondered \u2014 that was the one minus\nthat I always felt that we did not do a good job to \u2014 in other words, the American\nG.I. had a great sense of superiority, emotionally, and looked down on almost\nanybody that wasn\u2019t American. And I was sensitive to that.",

My son-\nin-law, married to our youngest daughter, who 1s dean of this law school in \u2014\nthey\u2019re Californian, and his father, my son-in-law\u2019s dad, was a major or colonel in\nthe tank corps.

I don\u2019t know if I\nmake myself clear.",
        "Q: Oh, sure.",
        "A: And he used to call his wife the kraut. She was born in Germany, and she was a\nwar bride. It always bothered me and I once \u2014 I\u2019d never really \u2014 I was going to talk\nto him about this, but I never really felt I wanted to get into that kind of\ninvolvement. So, I felt the same way, that I didn\u2019t want to diminish people\u2019s \u2014 what\n\u2014 cultural background, even though they were the enemies, I didn\u2019t \u2014 they were\nGermans.",

They were \u2014 I \u2014 the concentration camps were \u2014\nguards were Germans, the Nazis were Germans.

        "Q: Absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "A: So I looked at them as who they were. I interrogated some, when they needed\nsomeone to speak to a prisoner or two. And everybody told me they weren\u2019t Nazis.\nI never found a Nazi. But they all lied. They were always very [indecipherable] but\nI did the \u2014 later on, toward \u2014 when I was in Austria I did interrogate some SS\npeople. So that\u2019s [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Well, at wh-wha \u2014 when \u2014 when do you leave Italy, and for what reason?",
        "A: Oh. I was in northern Italy, I moved up from Naples, from \u2014 into some other\ntown, two little towns, I don\u2019t even remember their names. And when the war\nended, I was much in northern Italy, not far from the Po River, and I forget the little\ntown that we were in. I wish I\u2019d remember, and I didn\u2019t keep records of these\n129December 8, 2011\nthings. And I remember [indecipherable] for some reason I \u2014 we \u2014 I landed up\nbefore that at \u2014 at the Adriatic, and I have to look at the map to see what the name\nof the town was that I was in, because most of the time I was over of the\nMediterranean part of Italy. So I get pulled out of my outfit, and get into a \u2014 and I\ndon\u2019t quite remember all that, how \u2014 where I landed up, it\u2019s someplace that I\ndisliked the master sergeant that seemed to have no combat experience or any else,\nhad just come from the u \u2014 from the States. He was a regular army guy, never really\nparticipated in any of the combat situations [indecipherable] it all back, and he just\nhad come to northern Italy. And he tried to tell all these guys that had been there for\ntwo years or more how they should behave, you know, like back in the States, very\nG.I.",
        "Q: Now was it \u2014 was it a behavior \u2014 was it a discipline, or was it fraternizing \u2014",
        "A: Discipline, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Discipline?",
        "A: \u2014 get up in the morning and stand at attention and count off numbers and things\nhe didn\u2019t do any more, things that were done in basic training. And this guy, this\nmaster sergeant insisted on it. So it was a lot of \u2014 a lot of complaints about it, and\nthey finally stopped it and they kind of got rid of this guy. And I waited there for \u2014\n130December 8, 2011\nand I wasn\u2019t quite sure what my assignment was going to be, when I heard I was\nnow part of US forces in Austria.",
        "Q: Now, prior \u2014",
        "A: But before that my \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 prior to that, you had never been asked to used your German for the arm \u2014",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Prior to that \u2014",
        "A: They never used \u2014 they never, ever \u2014 this is the first time that my IBM card\ncame up \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 with that information apparently, because otherwise I would have gone with\nmy outfit and left Italy when the war ended. So I land up, and they tell me I am\nnow part of General Mark Clark, who was the commanding general, of whom I\nknew his aides because I traveled with them most of the time in Italy, the\nheadquarters of the Fifth Army. That\u2019s where I was ass \u2014 really originally assigned\nto. So it was kind of surprising to me. And once I get an order and tell that I\u2019m \u2014\nwe're going into \u2014 travel into Salzburg, which is a beautiful place.",
        "Q: Had you ever been there as a child?",
        "A: No. My friend Irving was \u2014 has been there.\n131December 8, 2011",
        "Q: And he was with you during that time?",
        "A: No, no, but he came \u2014 he \u2014 he wou \u2014 he would come for two hours, or three\nhours, or four hours. And he tells me, here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do in Salzburg,\nyou know, boom, boom, boom, because every \u2014 the Salzburg Festival are held\nevery summer, and the Vienna Philharmonic goes there and plays.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they have opera, you know, it\u2019s the birthplace of Mozart.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So he tells me, oh, you\u2019re going to Salzburg. Why am I going to Salzburg?\nBecause we\u2019re negotiating with the Russians, and according to the Potsdam treaty,\nthe United States and Great Britain and France and Russia\u2019s supposed to\nadminister and be the occupation forces for two cities: Berlin and Vienna. And the\nRussians were not going to let \u2014 they were playing possum with us, and possum,\nand they would not let us in, and from what I understood at that time, that they had\nnot paid their troops for three years, four years. And they \u2014",
        "Q: They would not let you in where?",
        "A: That was in nine \u2014 in May of 1944.",
        "Q: And they would not let you in where, exactly?",
        "A: That was in \u2014 that was, at that time, in Salzburg.\n132December 8, 2011",
        "Q: So \u2014 but they were not letting you go to \u2014",
        "A: No, they were at a place called Enz, on the Enz River, and Linz and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, and they weren\u2019t letting you go towards Vienna?",
        "A: No, they was \u2014 the \u2014 Austria was occ \u2014 it was separated, it was \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, it\nwas divided between \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember the British \u2014 I think the British had a\npiece of it, we had a piece of it. We were \u2014 north of Linz into Salzburg, was all\nAmerican.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Other parts were British, and little parts were French and most \u2014 and Vienna was\nall under the Russians. And if \u2014 from what I understand, it\u2019s never been publicized\nthat we gave \u2014 you see, everything at that time in Europe had printed money \u2014 had\nmoney printed in Baltimore, occupational money. Th-The local money was\nwithdrawn and not worth anything, or \u2014 and occupation money became the \u2014 the a \u2014\nis what you traded in. So we apparently gave them a truckload of printed money \u2014",
        "Q: Them being \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 occupation money, and they let it, and \u2014",
        "Q: Who is them?",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014I\u2014I mean, I love Salzburg, I \u2014 for a short time I stayed at this\nunbelievable chateau [indecipherable] we almost got kicked out, the G.I.s did,\n133December 8, 2011\ncause Mark Clark took it over. And it\u2019s now a si \u2014 it used \u2014 Arthur Miller, you\nknow, the playwright \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: \u2014 used to have a school there of a dramat \u2014 drama and it\u2019s now owned by some\nAmerican foundation. And a friend of mine\u2019s wife was a professor here at Drake\nUniversity and now retired, went there for six months.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of the chateau?",
        "A: No. It wasn\u2019t Mirabell(ph), which is a Mozart thing, and I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s\ncalled now, and I \u2014 I have to really go into my computer to figure out the name of tt.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Absolutely gorgeous. I didn\u2019t stay there long, about a couple weeks \u2014",
        "Q: So, you \u2014 you get into Austria, you get to Salzburg, you get to that chateau,\nwhat is going through your mind that you\u2019re back in Austria, what \u2014 what are you\nthinking?",
        "A: Unbelievable. Yes, I\u2014 I mean, it\u2019s almost indescribable. I mean, the emotional \u2014\nnever in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that that \u2014 that was \u2014 that would\nhappen to me. That where I got \u2014 I couldn\u2019t sit in a\u2014 in a park bench in Vienna, I\ncould not ride the tr \u2014 the trolley, I couldn\u2019t go to a movie, and here all of a sudden\nI\u2019m the conquering hero in Austria, walking around like I own the joint.\n134December 8, 2011",
        "Q: What \u2014 what \u2014 what were you and your unit doing, by the way, during the days?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: You were waiting for orders?",
        "A: Waiting for orders to see \u2014",
        "Q: And wer \u2014 did you have a lot of freedom to move around?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I gave you a \u2014 I'll give you a little anecdote, happened. So my \u2014 who\nshows up? My friend Irving. So he knows \u2014 he knows the surrounding. He \u2014 they\nused to come every summer they \u2014 they have rented a place because his father\nplayed at the orchestra. And so I get this whole history about Mozart and\neverything that really was important and what house he lived in, and the\nMozarteum, and we go to the library, and we see things I\u2019ve never expected to see,\nyou know, going back 500 years. And \u2014 and one day we go into a little shop to send\n\u2014 get some postcards to send home. And he pulls out of \u2014 we look at these\npostcards, quite old, and he pulls out one postcard, and it\u2019s Toscanini. You know\nwho he is?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You \u2014 you know who he was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Hello?\n135\nDecember 8, 2011",
        "Q: Yes, yes, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. He was probably the most famous conductor in the world at one time. He\nconducted the NBCs Philharmonic, the symphony. He was the \u2014 if you go and look\nup \u2014 go to Google and look up a Toscanini, you\u2019 ll be \u2014 there wasn\u2019t \u2014 nobody\u2019s\never been suppersed(ph) \u2014 sup \u2014 really has got the fame that he had as a conductor,\nItalian fellow. So he is conducting \u2014 no, he\u2019s rehearsing \u2014 on this postcard, he\u2019s\nrehearsing the Vienna Philharmonic. And there are people in shirtsleeves, and\nthere are people standing around on the periphery of this orchestra. And my friend\nIrving pulls it out and he shows me one of the peoples \u2014 boys, he was like 14 years\nold, or 13 years old, was him.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Is that [indecipherable]? So, when I was",
        "Q: Did he buy the postcard?",
        "A: Yes, he bought it. I looked for others, but it\u2019s the only one where he had. So I\nwent \u2014 I was a \u2014 three years ago I was with two friends, I was in Munich and\nBerlin and I stopped over in \u2014 1n \u2014 in Salzburg. I went to that little shop, and this\nlittle old lady, and this little old guy, still in that same shi \u2014 same people.",
        "Q: Really?\n136December 8, 2011",
        "A: And I went through again, trying to find another postcard like that, but I\ncouldn\u2019t. I spent about a half hour going through their inventory. So, it was a very\nfascinating, to me, you know? So here we are, and finally get orders to drive with\nanother guy, we had our own Jeep, to drive into Vienna.",
        "Q: One more question before \u2014 before we get to the part where you get back to\nVienna.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 I do have one more question before we get to the part where you get to\nVienna.",
        "A: Yes, sure.",
        "Q: In Salzburg, I\u2019m guessing you are interacting with the locals cause you have the\nfreedom to move around and you speak the language.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What is your sense from them? How are they reacting to you as an American,\nand how are you react \u2014 reacting to them as Austrians?",
        "A: I acted like an American. I didn\u2019t speak German, I wouldn\u2019t speak German.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Unless I had to. I had this \u2014 and I\u2019m ashamed to tell you this, because things\nchange, that I truly \u2014 I was a \u2014 I\u2019d lorded it over them. I\u2019m a conqueror. They\n137December 8, 2011\nkicked me out. You know, this is a terrible, hurtful thing for us. My father was in\nDachau.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We took \u2014 you know, we saw what happened to Austria, we see how the\nAustrians responded and what they did to the Jewish people.",
        "Q: And when you say you \u2014",
        "A: So [had this, you know, this feeling, and it translated itself, I think, in my\nbehavior.",
        "Q: How \u2014 how did it translate itself? What did you do?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 you know, I never told people that I\u2019m Austrian.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was an American, period. That\u2019s how far it went.",
        "Q: But was there anything else that you did that was \u2014 where you used your\nposition?",
        "A: No, I\u2014I just \u2014 I\u2019m like an observer. Really, you know, I was a\u2014 I wasn\u2019t even\nofficer, I was a s \u2014 you know, I was a sergeant. And so I didn\u2019t have much\nauthority. I had enough authority because of my uniform, and it was \u2014 you know, it\n\u2014 that was enough. So you had to be pretty careful about yourself, that it didn\u2019t run\naway with \u2014 with \u2014 with it. It wa \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult, I think, to describe what it\n138December 8, 2011\nfeels like to be a conqueror, or to be in a foreign country, even though to me it\nwasn\u2019t \u2014 Salzburg was no longer my country, it was \u2014 \u2019m an American. And that\nwas very important to me, to make this distinction. And I looked at it like an\nobserver. I didn\u2019t have a feeling any more for being a native of Austria, or have a\nsense of pride.",
        "Q: Did the Austrians \u2014",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did the Austri \u2014 did the Austrians fear the Americans? Was this \u2014 was there any\nkind of sense that they were worried about what was coming?",
        "A: No? You mean, the Americans, or the \u2014 the Germans?",
        "Q: The \u2014 the \u2014 the Austrians, the locals around Salzburg. Was there any feeling \u2014",
        "A: Well, there was [indecipherable] yes, they were very \u2014 I think they were very\nvulnerable. The ec \u2014 the economics were pretty bad. Food was not easily available.\nThe \u2014 the natives kind of did not really have a high profile, they kind of stuck to\ntheir homes. And you know, they saw the Nazis behavior. And I think there was a\ncertain amount of submerged \u2014 whatever they tell you that they didn\u2019t know what\nwas going on with the concentration camps and the gassing and all this, they knew\nit. So, I think in their own psyche, they felt this basic sense of insecurity, because\nthe German army, and the Austrian army, though it really was really part of the\n139December 8, 2011\nGerman army \u2014 and you know, if you go back in the history, more Austrians were\nassociated with the concentration camps than Germans. They were probably the\nworst anti-Semites. So you felt very, very \u2014 I think they were \u2014 they themselves\nknew what they did, and kept a low, low profile. And so, I really \u2014 my opportunity\nto talk to local people was really not that big.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were there any American G.I.s who were somehow using their status\nor their power for nefarious goals?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. The \u2014 there \u2014 there was no questioning about the occupation.\nThe United States moved in there very \u2014 with lock, stock and barrel. I mean, we\nhad everything. We had food, we had \u2014 you know, had PXs, we had \u2014 we took over\nthe best hotels. We were \u2014 we were the conquerors. And we had strong feelings of\nsuperiority, subconsciously and consciously.",
        "Q: And di \u2014",
        "A: So we made these people feel pretty small, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 and they if \u2014 and\nthe worse they behaved during the war, I think the more afraid they were.",
        "Q: Was there any fraternization with Austrian women?",
        "A: Yes, some. Wer \u2014 I never had any. I\u2019m trying to think why I never had any. I\nhand a girlfriend at home, and I was corresponding with her almost on a daily basis.\nYou know [indecipherable] V \u2014 V-letters. She\u2019s \u2014 my wife is a very wonderful\n140December 8, 2011\nwriter. She has a fantastic ability. She really should have been an author. She never\nreally pursued it, but she wrote the most beautiful letters. So I really was very much\nin love with her. And so really I had no \u2014 ever had any kind of relationship with any\nwoman. I\u2019m trying to think \u2014 not even, you know, I spoke the language.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I never \u2014 I never \u2014 never occurred to me. And the other thing, I think \u2014\nokay, I will tell you a story that \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I should really \u2014 okay. The \u2014\nthe \u2014 somehow, I had a sense of \u2014 was it discipline or morals or ethics, or whatever\nyou may want to call it, instilled to me by my parents. There was no deviation. I\nnever messed around with any woman. And \u2014 except one time. And that later came,\nbefore going home, that I had to get up on ship \u2014 I mean, I had no \u2014 no\nrelationships, but I got involved into a situation in Marseilles, France, which was\nvery strange. Now, if we have time I\u2019Il tell you about it \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, we have plenty of time.",
        "A: \u2014 and promise not to put it into my biography.",
        "Q: Oh, no.",
        "A: Because it was so unusual, yeah, yes.",
        "Q: Sure.\n141December 8, 2011",
        "A: And \u2014 and my wife, you know, everybody, all of my friends know that story, my\nwife knows the story. But anyways, up to that time, there wasn\u2019t anything that \u2014 that\nreally I felt was \u2014 somehow it never appeared, I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember. I can remember\nwhy I never had any attraction to any of the German or Austrian women, or Italian\nwomen. I did make the acquaintances of one Jewish woman in Naples, and she was\na violinist, and the only thing that we had was my love for music and her talent.\nAnd I went to her \u2014 with her a few \u2014 she was Jewish and she was a violinist and she\ngave recitals, and I went with her while I stayed in Naples, up to a few of her\nrecitals. And that was a f\u2014 one woman that I met and I helped her out a little bit\nwith food, what they were very short on at that particular time, with her mother.",
        "Q: In Salzburg, were there G.I.s helping out the local Austrians with food, or was\nthat \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think so. The \u2014 the women in Austria, particularly in Vienna.\nVienna was starved for men, because they either were in prisons, they were in\nstalags, or they were in \u2014 killed. And it was a shortage of male people when I got\ninto Vienna. The G.I.s were just having a ball.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s talk about getting into Vienna. How did that happen?",
        "A: So, the Russians finally said okay, you come in. So that time was springtime,\nand my \u2014 one of my \u2014 and I can\u2019t \u2014 a-all I remember, this guy and I were assigned\n142December 8, 2011\nto this Jeep, or this Jeep was assigned to us. And we were in Linz at that time,\nwhich was the border between \u2014 we were waiting for the opportunity to get into \u2014\nacross the Russian zone. And they finally \u2014 th \u2014 we negotiated that \u2014 I didn\u2019t, but\nyou know, the army did, and got the signal to drive into Vienna and to take over\ncertain da \u2014I got places, and a list of places that we should take over, at which hotel\nwe should stay, and some apartments that were at one time held by some Nazi\nfunctionaries, to take over for our incoming troops. And only about 200 Americans\nto be \u2014 that were going into the first occupation. I think that\u2019s what the number was,\nbut don\u2019t pin me down on it, but I don\u2019t quite remember. So we got into our Jeep\nand got our stuff in the back. And I remember picking up a \u2014 a Russian officer, and\nwe offered him some cognac, and he \u2014 I think he drank that whole bottle, we just\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. And we got into Vienna at about \u2014 oh, must have been after\nlunch, something like one o\u2019clock or so, and the place was very few people. What\nhappened as we drove through the \u2014 from the suburbs in, that every time there was\nsome people walking and they saw us, they would duck into the closest building,\nwhere the doors were open maybe, you know, the gates.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Apparently, they thought we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have much \u2014 I don\u2019t think we had any\nAmerican flag painted on our Jeep, or our uniforms didn\u2019t \u2014 weren\u2019t very\n143December 8, 2011\nrecognizable. I wore fatigues, so did my buddy. And I had my helmet packed in a\nbag, in my barracks bag, and \u2014 and on our way in I say to this fellow in the camp,\nhe was from \u2014 near Cincinnati \u2014 Covington \u2014 coving \u2014 Covington, Kentucky. I\nsays, I want to take you to my old neighborhood where I grew up. Want to do that?\nHe says, absolutely. So we \u2014 we \u2014 we kind of turned the Jeep into that direction.\nIt\u2019s like the suburb \u2014 not suburb, but next to the first district was where our district\nwas, not far walking distance to where the opera 1s, and the Ringstrasse \u2014 you ever\nbeen in Vienna?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Have you?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yes, yes.",
        "A: You did? So, not far. Even though it\u2019s the 20\" district, it was very close to the\nfirst district. We drive up on our street where our buil \u2014 where we sh \u2014 we s \u2014 lived\nin an apartment house, and didn\u2019t see a soul. And there\u2019s certain \u2014 several buildings\nhad been shelled. There were holes in them, big ones, and probably nobody living\nin them. But my \u2014 our building was not damaged, and \u2014 and the buildings across the\nstreet were not damaged. And we pulled our Jeep up, and it \u2014 when places have\nbeen shelled, that \u2014 kind of a funny silence, there\u2019s no birds singing, or things like\nthat, and it was spring \u2014 it was late spring, the beginning of summer, I think. And\n144\nDecember 8, 2011\nwe pulled up, and I showed this guy, my buddy what \u2014 second floor up here, he\nlook up and that\u2019s where our apartment was. I wonder if we can go in there, in the\nbuilding, then \u2014 maybe the front \u2014 the gate was open, and see who lives there, who\ntook over our apartment, and \u2014 and what it looks like. And just about when we\u2019re\ndiscussing this, and no people, this place is empty, a woman comes out of the\nbuilding that we lived in, and she\u2019s carrying a pail. And there\u2019s, across the street\nfrom the building, an \u2014 a lot of cobblestones in Vienna, and \u2014 it\u2019s an old city. And\nshe keeps her head down, because she sees these two soldiers sitting in this open\nJeep, and there have been a lot of rapes before we got there, by the Russians\n[indecipherable]. But she\u2019s an elderly woman. And keeps her head down, but she\nlooks \u2014 turns it and looks at us, and I had my \u2014 I don\u2019t have my hat on. I recognize\nher, who she was. She was a neighbor of ours. And she looks, and all of a sudden,\nshe drops the pail [music \u2014 phone ringing] who is this? That\u2019s my wife, hold on a\nsecond.",
        "Q: Sure.",

She\u2019s telling me I\u2019m\ntying up the phone. Okay, I know. Anyways, we get this \u2014 wrong part for her to do\nit. Well, we\u2019re going to conclude. So anyways, she looks and recognizes me \u2014 and I\n145\nDecember 8, 2011\nhave curly hair \u2014 and she drops the pail and screams my name. And all of a sudden\n\u2014 and she comes rushing over to me, and starts hugging and kissing me, and \u2014 and\nall of a sudden the street fills up with, I don\u2019t know, hundreds \u2014 hundred \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, lots of people. They all kissing me and hugging me and my God, then where\nis my mom and my dad, and where are the Schtolzenbergs(ph), which is another\nJewish family lived in that building, and they knew they were \u2014 they left for the\nUnited States much before us. And \u2014 oh, and Walter is here. That\u2019s a guy I used to\nplay with when I was very young, his grandmother lived in that same building, he\nused to come and visit. He had just come out of a prison camp. American stalag.\nAnd \u2014 and so he came down, and I didn\u2019t know what to say to him, and vice versa. I\ngave away everything I had, like rations and \u2014 K-rations, or whatever I had, and\nsaid, Pll be back. I never went back. I went back many years later, s \u2014 not \u2014 maybe\n10 years later, and my mother sent me a bunch of money, I should give \u2014 she gave\nme a bunch of names, and I should give out money to some neighbors that were\nvery supportive of us. Which I didn\u2019t know. And I found them, and I start \u2014 I gave\nthem like hundred dollar bills. They really were very sup \u2014 most appreciative with\nus. So I \u2014",

        "A: Yes, correct. It\u2019s kind of a love-hate, or hate-love, or whatever. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe that\u2019s the wrong term, but it was things that, you know, where were you?\nWhere were they when we needed them? But they couldn\u2019t help themselves. So,\nthey always wanted to know how are my dad, and how is my mom, and what\u2019s\ngoing on, and so \u2014 how did I come, and I\u2019m an American soldier. And they treated\nme like I was, you know, the Prince of Wales, or President Roosevelt, or whoever.\nIt was \u2014 and then I said, I\u2019ll be back, I\u2019ll be \u2014 but I never gone. And I went, did\nsome foolish things. I remember that I used to hang out 1n a place called the\nAugarten \u2014 Ausarten(ph) \u2014 Augarten, which was next to my gymnasium, and\nwhere kids would hang out. And then when the Nazis took over, they put the graffiti\non every bench, no Jews allowed, you know, Juden verboten. Couldn\u2019t sit on a\npark bench. So I went back there, I think I sat on 20 different benches.",

She had a\nsister lived in Israel. And I was \u2014 I think I made five to six trips to Israel. And I\n148\nDecember 8, 2011\nfound some people there, my [indecipherable] girlfriend. She was 16 and I was 16.\nSo then I finally got home. In Marseilles I had some experience that were\nsomewhat funny. And if you promise not to put it into my biography, I\u2019ll tell you.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: It was \u2014 I was waiting in Marseilles, and just actually waiting for \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nfor how long, because there was so many people going home, and so few ships. So\nwe had what\u2019s called a s \u2014 they had cigarette camps. They were \u2014 camps were\ncalled Pall Mall, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, all after cigarettes. And they were\nbig camps, were all staging areas, you know. We had several million G.I-s in\nEurope, they had all \u2014 they had \u2014 all had to come home. And one day a few guys\ncame in, and they said they want to go to Marseilles, and I said I have no interest.\nAnd they said well, we want to check out a weapons\u2019 carrier, and a Jeep, then we\ncan\u2019t check it out with you. Without me. So I succumbed to the things, and I didn\u2019t\nrealize that the jees \u2014 well, I knew that the \u2014 three of those guys were made \u2014 had to\n\u2014 made the invasion of Marseilles with the 42\u2122 division, and they knew the town.\nAnd I said, Pll go to go in, but what are you guys \u2014 I\u2019m going to go and find \u2014 if I\nfind some museum, or find a synagogue or something that I \u2014 I was always\ninterested in art, and see what the town looked like, and always remember Charles\nBoyer, about France and Marseilles, and anyways, he was a big movie star at one\n149December 8, 2011\ntime, and so \u2014 French \u2014 so I went, and the first thing, that was in the morning, early,\nthey want to go to the house of prostitution. Well, not me. I said, I\u2019m not going, I'll\ndrop you guys off, and Pll pick you up in an hour, an hour and a half, whatever. So,\nthis 1s nine o\u2019clock in the morning, and they\u2019re knocking on our door, and it\u2019s \u2014 that\ntime, prostitution was legalized in France until we came, the Americans, and made\nit illegal. But \u2014 so this place was one of the legalized places, and they had signs\noutside, off-limits, and out of bounds for the British, that\u2019s what they said. We said\noff-limits, you couldn\u2019t go in, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Who \u2014 who said that it was off-limits?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Which authority said it was off-limits, who put the signs out?",
        "A: The \u2014 the British put down \u2014 we put on off-limits, and the British put down out\nof bounds. That\u2019s what they call it, we call it \u2014",
        "Q: I see. So which \u2014 which sign was it, was if off-limits or out of bounds?",
        "A: Both, both signs, both [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Both. So American G.I.s were not supposed to frequent the house, okay.",
        "A: Right. And neither do \u2014 neither were the \u2014 neither were \u2014",
        "Q: British.",
        "A: \u2014 British.\n150December 8, 2011",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But they\u2019re banging on the door, and I\u2019m sitting in that weapons carrier, and\nwaiting to see what time they want me to come back, there\u2019s \u2014 coming across the\nstreet, they say \u2014 you gotta come. Why? We need 10 people like a million. But 1\u2014\nwhat do you need 10 people? Well, they got a show. And we \u2014 they don\u2019t want to\nput it on unless they have 10 and you\u2019re the number 10. So I go in and they put on a\nporno sh \u2014 girls \u2014 they wake up the girls and they \u2014 they all lived there. It was like\nMarlene Dietrich was in that place, you know, the \u2014 the lampshades had little\nstrings around them, and \u2014 and they had an old Victrola that you had to wind up,\nand they had these couches. And I had a sat \u2014 I had not sat on a couch for two years.\nSo I sat there, you know, the girls come over and they try to entice you, and so it\nwas all a si\u2014 to make a long story short, I decided I behaved myself for two years,\nI\u2019m not gonna go get a venereal disease or get [indecipherable] and how will I\nexplain it to my \u2014 which I hope will be my fianc\u00e9e, and tell the story? Finally, they\nstart drinking, they were selling cognac, and \u2014 and I\u2019m ready to go and one of \u2014 one\nof the guys gets drunk. Big fellow, and \u2014 but that time he sees no evil, and I finally\nconvince him to get out of there. Some girls \u2014 some guys check \u2014 you know,\nshacked up with these girls. Didn\u2019t take very long, and we\u2019re carrying out this one\nguy who had \u2014 so drunk he couldn\u2019t walk. And we went back to camp, okay\u2019? End\n151December 8, 2011\nof story. Not the real end of story. Twenty-five or 30 years later, I\u2019m in \u2014 in \u2014 I live\nin Des Moines, and maybe was longer than that, and this is a group that I have\nnever known \u2014 never heard of Des Moines when I was in Marseilles, I never heard\nof Iowa. I lived in New York City, right? And you know, I came to New York, I\nlived in New York, I went to school in New York, I had hoped to stay in New\nYork, and never heard of Iowa. So I\u2019m in \u2014 back in \u2014 maybe 34 years \u2014 30 years\nlater, maybe more. And I\u2019m in charge \u2014 I think I was president of the federation, or\nsomething, or \u2014 anyways, I\u2019m in charge of the Holocaust Memorial Service. I think\nI was somehow either vice president or president of the federation. And \u2014 Jewish\nfederation. So somebody says to me, I should guy \u2014 call a guy \u2014 oh, no, wait a\nminute. I\u2019m sorry, I got the story wrong. I\u2019m going to a \u2014 a national convention,\nSaint Louis, representing Des Moines, I was president of the federation here, of the\nGA, general \u2014 it\u2019s called the General Assembly of all the Jewish communities that\nmeet once a year, the officers. And this is in Saint Louis. And I had some good\ncustomers in Saint Louis, who \u2014 whose owner \u2014 one of the owners of this\nmanufacturing company was also president of the Jewish Federation of Saint\nLouis, and I was of the Jewish Federation in Des Moines. So we\u2019re business\ncolleagues, and they were my customers and he calls me up and he says, I want you\n[indecipherable] and I\u2019m there, you know, at the convention. We\u2019re having a\n152December 8, 2011\nFriday night Shabbat dinner, and I want you to come, and I want you to meet some\nother people. Okay, there were about 12 people there, one of which was \u2014 this is\nbefore the Holocaust Museum was \u2014 they were just planning it. I think the\ngovernment had just given land to it. And one of the persons there \u2014 there were\nsome well-known Jewish people there at the dinner, and one of the persons there\nwas \u2014 and I can\u2019t remember his name, and he says to me \u2014 we\u2019re talking, and he\nwas in charge of the \u2014 I think this was during Carter\u2019s administration, that the land\nwas given by the government to the Jewish community to build the Holocaust\nMuseum on the mall. And he was, at the time, the person responsible for getting the\nplanning done and everything else. Not the \u2014 okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He\u2019s a well-known \u2014 and I can\u2019t remember his name, but a well-known person in\nthe Jewish commun \u2014 in Jewish national affairs.

And one fellow was one of the first pers \u2014 into Dachau, the\nliberation, and he\u2019s never forgotten it, is from Iowa.

He lives in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and he gave me his name. And he says,\nif you ever have something, you know, about the Holocaust, in the memorial, or you\ndo it once a year, remembrance day, call him up and get him to speak.

        "A: I just wanted to get out. It somehow reproduced memories, and I knew how \u2014\nhow bad the Nazis were. I tried to find some Jewish people when I was in Vienna. I\nthink there may have been maybe 10 or 12, or maybe 20, but \u2014",
        "Q: How did you find it, did you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they were just trying to get a community going, and they were this \u2014 they\nweren\u2019t even from Vienna. I did meet one \u2014 I was back there a few years later. I\nwas skiing in \u2014 in Innsbruck, in the mountains, and I \u2014 then somehow, I don\u2019t\nknow why, we did go to Vienna for a few days, couple of days, I think, and I ran\ninto a Jewish ski instructor, young man. And he told me at that time that there\nwasn\u2019t hardly any Jews, he stay \u2014 he was hidden during the war, or not hidden\n[indecipherable] didn\u2019t know \u2014 people didn\u2019t know he was Jewish.

        "A: Yes, yes, I\u2014 I \u2014 trying to think. It had to be \u2014 I lived with it, because of my\nrelatives. But we never knew \u2014 never knew the en \u2014 well, we knew the enormity\nbecause the people all disappeared. I had a grandfather that disap \u2014 that I don\u2019t \u2014\nnever met, I never saw, or a couple of uncles. And I found my mother\u2019s sister, who\nper \u2014 was supposed to \u2014 said she was the housekeeper, but I think she may have\nbeen the mistress of the \u2014 one of the \u2014 the Supreme Court Justices at \u2014 in \u2014 in\nBelgium, who left her this palatial home, right smack on the \u2014 what was it, Rue de\nJustice in Brussels. And I met my other, and I found my other co \u2014 I found a cousin\nwho lived through it. I ran into my first girlfriend, I \u2014 I mean, I never ran into her, I\nfound her in \u2014 in Canada, and she told me how she was s-smuggled over the\nmountains, the Alps, into Italy.",

And there was a lot of\nblack market going on, big time. You buy s \u2014 carton of cigarettes for 50 cents, and\nyou sold it for t\u2014 for a hundred dollars, or 200 dollars, in all occupation money. I\njust give you an idea of that. So all of this was such an unnatural situation; things\nthat I didn\u2019t want to be involved with. And \u2014 and I had these responsibilities, and I\nwanted out, and I want to go home, I had a girlfriend. I just couldn\u2019t wait to go back\nto the States. And I saw \u2014 I saw Vienna naked.",

        "A: Anti-Semitic, hated Jews. They worst \u2014 I think they were worse than the\nGermans. I have a good friend, he always jokes to me about it, he says Vienna is a\nbeautiful city, there\u2019s only one thing wrong. What\u2019s that? Vien \u2014 the Viennese. And\nto this very dear \u2014 very day I think there is \u2014 anti-Semitism is still very strong in\nAustria.",

        "A: I\u2014I had been \u2014 I had been in Vienna a few times and I\u2019d taken two by \u2014 I had\nridden my bikes twice, from Germany into Vienna on a bike path along the\nDanube. And I\u2019ve taken a group of people from Des Moines twice. And somehow\n\u2014 it\u2019s maybe me, it may not be them, that I have this oversensitivity, the amount of \u2014\nof vulnerability, and I don\u2019t feel \u2014 I just don\u2019t \u2014 I feel so \u2014 I, you know, I live ina\ncommunity of 450,000 - 500,000 people, and about 1200 Jewish families here. I\nfeel comfortable, I feel secure. I feel part of the community, and it\u2019s \u2014 and when I\ngo to Vienna, I feel the opposite. There is that vulnerability that they somehow\n160December 8, 2011\nwere able to trans \u2014 trans \u2014 transfer to them s \u2014 to me, yeah. I \u2014 I was \u2014 in one of my\nski trips, I left my group, and \u2014 and I was going to go to Dachau. And I went to\nMunich, and I never been in Dachau.

I went, I\nbought a ticket in the \u2014 the automatic kiosk, and I couldn\u2019t get on the train. I just\ncouldn\u2019t make it, I just couldn\u2019t get on. And I went out to get lunch, and I saw these\npeople with the tyr \u2014 Tyrolean, or alpine outfits, and laughing, and sitting by\nthemselves. I felt so terribly vulnerable and insecure and said, what in the world am\nI doing here. And that\u2019s the kind of feeling that I\u2019ve never been able to lose when I\n\u2014 and I\u2019ve been in Vienna, I don\u2019t know, four, five, six times. And I go there, it\u2019s\nlike some people go to \u2014 you know, they go to [indecipherable] they kind of have a\nholiday where they \u2014 they whip each other, they whip themselves. And I go\n[indecipherable] get my whipping. It\u2019s \u2014 I have no any more, any traditional\nfeelings about tt.",

        "Q: You got it out of your system.",
        "A: I got it out of my system. I belong to a hundred year old discussion club, and \u2014\nand once every si\u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there are 47 \u2014 42 members, and once a month\nsomebody presents a paper. And it can\u2019t have anything to do with your profession,\nor the [indecipherable] gotta hide the content of the paper, because after\ndiscussion, you know, they don\u2019t want to shoot you down. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a kind of a\nhard club to get into. So, my paper last \u2014 my turn came up, and I decided to do a\npaper on \u2014 I have an 11\" \u2014 this 11 minute film about Hitler coming to Vienna. I got\nit from the Holocaust Museum.

And the town in this movie \u2014 it\u2019s done, the\nmovie is silent. It was done by an American professor who were visiting there, who\nhad a little Kodak camera. And he was just \u2014 he had this unbelievable ability to be\nat the right time, to take pictures of Hitler coming to Vienna, and the \u2014 the beez \u2014\nand the enthusiasm with which the Viennese greeted the Nazis. And also there\u2019s a\nlittle episodes in there about his wife trying to go into a Jewish shop, and the SA\nguy wouldn\u2019t let her in, you know, because he said, this is a Jewish merchant, you\nshouldn\u2019t buy here. It\u2019s an 11 minute film. Let me tell you what \u2014 I have, someplace\nhere in my office \u2014 Ill \u2014 before I \u2014 we hang up, Pll \u2014 Pll give you \u2014 oh, here it 1s.\nSo you may want to take a look at it, all right?",

        "A: \u2014 APO. So I \u2014 in other words, this, the \u2014 an APO, no matter where it was, was\nextremely important. That was the only kind of communication the G.I.s had, of re\n\u2014 you know, sending home letters, of receiving letters, or sending home packages,\nor may \u2014 sending home money and money orders. So, it was an army post office,\nwhich was very \u2014 part of the adjutant general\u2019s thing. So I got into that field, which\n\u2014 no experience, so anyways, I think of my honesty, integrity, or whatever. Okay, so\nwe\u2019re close to occupation, I want to get out of here, I want to go home. I want to go\nhome so badly. Finally my number came up, my points I had \u2014 you had to have so\nmany points to get discharged. I wrote to you \u2014 I did mention that I found my\nmother\u2019s sister.",

It\u2019s in the\n168December 8, 2011\nfirst district and it\u2019s in a building. You can\u2019t know it\u2019s a synagogue unless \u2014 unless\nyou \u2019ve been there before. You walk through a regular apartment building and inside\nis another \u2014 almost another building, and that\u2019s a synagogue.

        "A: Yes. My father was born in 1898 in Nadworna, which is a small town in western\nPoland, and he left there just at the beginning, or before the start of World War I,\nand emigrated to Vienna. My mother was born of five children. Excuse me, my dad\nwas of \u2014 was one of two children \u2014 two or three, and I don\u2019t quite recall. My mother\nwas one of five, and she and her parents left Belz, b-e-l-z, Poland. Again, that was\nDecember 2, 2011\nunder the governing ship of Austria at that time, before the first World War, and\nwhen the war broke out, my grandfather apparently had a general store in Belz, and\nthey buried all their merchandise, because they felt that the war would be taking\nplace where they lived, and they went on to the west, and they ended up with\nrelatives in Budapest for a very short time; then emigrated to Vienna at the\nbeginning of World War I.",

        "A: They were very young. I think \u2014 well, 1914 when the war broke out, so they were\neither 16 or 17 years old.",
        "A: That is a puzzle. I don\u2019t know. I think that the Jewish population of Vienna was\npretty large. I think the city itself was \u2014 had a population of about two and a half\nmillion, and about 200,000 were Jewish. And so apparently the people that came\nfrom the same areas in the \u2014 eastern Europe, because the Hapsburg Empire at that\ntime was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of western\nPoland, and Czechoslovakia and went as far as down to northern \u2014 what later\nbecame northern Italy. And so there was a lot of social activity going on, and I\nDecember 2, 2011\nreally don\u2019t quite know how they really met. All I knew that I was a child that really\nbe \u2014 that came in 1923, so the war was over in 1918, so this was a very difficult\neconomic time, and I \u2014 not very much was talked about on how they met, and I\nreally never found out.",

And my \u2014 I think they both knew some Polish,\nbut I don\u2019t think \u2014 think \u2014 because their schooling both was done in ger \u2014 in\nGerman, because I| think that the Austrian empire at that time went as far east as\nwhere they lived.

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 what stands out in my memory, and it sometimes fades out, but I still\nremember, in 1938 \u2014 January of 1938, at that time the German and Austrian schools\nDecember 2, 2011\nhad a winter vacation. In Austria, their national sport is skiing, and soccer. And I\nwas just \u2014 I was put on skis at only six years old. So, I was with my school on a\nwinter vacation at \u2014 at some of the mountains, the [indecipherable] kind of not the\nAlps, but kind of the foothills of the Alps for one week with my school, skiing \u2014 for\na skiing vacation. And it was \u2014 had to be January of 1938. I still remember it\nbecause I wa \u2014 I participated in a ski race, and I won kind of a little trophy, and I\nwas very proud of it, and I \u2014 but by the second run or whatever it is, I ken \u2014I had a\nbad fall, or whatever it was, and I kind of dislocated my thumb, and I remember that.\nSo, when my parents picked me up at the railroad station, coming back from that\nschool vacation, they seemed at edge, and explained to me that things were not\ndoing very well. They had received information and in contact with some friends or\nrelatives in Germany \u2014 and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time,\nthe Nuremberg laws, which this qualified and you know, makes the Jews of\nGermany not only second class, but third and fourth class citizens and they lost\ntheir jobs, particularly if they were government jobs, or sensitive jobs like movies,\nor livit \u2014 or publishing and things like that, the discrimination really was beginning\nto really hurt in Germany, and my parents were very much aware of it. So when I di\n\u2014 they picked me up and I still remember they picked me up at a \u2014 at the railroad\nstation and on the way home were telling me what was going on politically in\nDecember 2, 2011\nAustria at that time. And it was, if you go back into history, there was a chancellor\nof Austria, his name was Schuschnigg, and he represented the \u2014 kind of a little bit\nof a also \u2014I would say little bit a of a dictatorship, but not as strongly as what the\nNazis had. He represented the Christian Austrian Christian party, which was the \u2014\nthe Conservative party. Vienna\u2019s representation was more social democratic, and\nmy father was involved in the social democratic party. And at that time there were\nall kinds of demonstrations in Vienna. The Nazis had become determined again that\nthey were, since 1934 the Nazi party was outlawed in Germany \u2014 in Austria,\nbecause they had tri-tried to have a putsch, and overthrow the government. They\nkilled Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr \u2014 in trying to do it, but that was aborted,\nand the Austrian government was able to arrest and \u2014 and kill some of the people\nwho tried to overthrow the government, and this \u2014 and that time outlawed the Nazi\nparty. So, in 1938, the beginning, the negotiations were going on between the pr \u2014\nthe president of Austria and Hitler. He would summon him \u2014 Hitler would\nsummon him to Berchtesgaden and really threaten him with all kinds of bad things,\nand scream at him, and was looking to annex Austria to Germany. And the guy\nstood firm, Schuschnigg did, for a while. So all this demonstration of voting for\nannexation to Austria, or Austria re-remaining independent, took place in the\nbeginning of 1938. Some of the negotiations that took place which \u2014 in Austria and\nDecember 2, 2011\nGermany, that Austria submitted to Germany, and let some people, Nazis, out of\nprison, and \u2014 and also appointed them to certain key jobs within the Austrian\ngovernment. Seyss-Inquart was one of them, and I don\u2019t quite remember what\nnames of the other people that became like the commissioner of safety, and some\nother tr \u2014 cabinets \u2014 j-jobs, and it really did not look very well for the independence\nof Austria at that time. I know a lot of street demonstrations in which my father had\nparticipated.",

        "A: No.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Good question. Let me just think for a minute. There were occasionally some\nwords thrown, anti-Semitic, you know, about Jews, but not too much, because many\nof my friends were non-Jewish, even though I had my \u2014 I also had two cousins to\nwhom I was very close, my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s sons. And one was same age as I, and\none was a year and a half younger. And they were very di \u2014 they, at very young,\nwere very involved in Hashomer Hatzair, which was a left wing of the Zionist\nmovement in Austria. And I used to also belong to that youth group. I'd go\noccasionally. I wasn\u2019t this vehement about it that \u2014 as my two cousins, to whom I\nwas very close. And we would sometimes walk together. And I don\u2019t quite\nremember, and I \u2014 I just don\u2019t know if there were ever any anti-Semitic sl \u2014 you\nknow, slogans \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or words thrown at us. I \u2014 there must have been, but it may have happened\nlater, and not about that time. I think I lived a very secure \u2014 being an only child, and\nfairly \u2014 my parents, you know, were fairly well-off, and we lived a very\ncomfortable, middle class life, and I was never aware of these things, and I \u2014 most of\nthe kids I went to school with \u2014 not most, but a great portion of them were not\nJewish.\nDecember 2, 2011",

        "A: I don\u2019t think of \u2014 I think because of maybe my economic status \u2014 not mine, but\nmy parents\u2019, and they \u2014 I think I was more sheltered, being an only child. And\nsomehow or other, I don\u2019t know, politically, I think we\u2019re \u2014 we were maybe much\nmore assimilated. My parents are very \u2014 they did \u2014 they were Zionists, to a degree. I\nmean, I remember going to certain propaganda movies that we went to as a family,\nwhich there was a tremendous amount \u2014 well, actually, tremendous is a little bit \u2014 as\nyou know, Herzl the founder of Israel was a li \u2014 you know, lived in Austria, lived\nin Vienna, and there was a \u2014 a very strong Zionist Jewish force that really played \u2014\nplayed a very, I \u2014 I think positive role in the Jewish life of Vienna. You know, there\nare 250,000 Jews living, so you had all kinds of political positions and beliefs. And\nsomehow my two cousins were very much into \u2014 into \u2014 even though they were one a\nyear younger, and one the same age as me, either 15 and 16 years, or 14 and 15\nyears old, they went to a lot of those meetings, and I didn\u2019t. Why? I still question it\nbecause later on I became very strong, both in my, you know, in my I-living here in\nDecember 2, 2011\nIowa, I was very involved in Jewish affairs, I was president of federation, I was\npresident of annual drive, and I\u2019ve been participatory in national politics, you know,\nwith AIPAC and some other organizations. So, it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 that time, for some reason,\nI was much more assimilated.",

        "A: I don\u2019t quite remember, except my mother was \u2014 did give her money a few times.\nWe were fairly not \u2014 somewhat affluent, and \u2014 because I remember that \u2014 that many\nJewish people had no money, my parents used to dish out money. And there was a \u2014\na system where rel \u2014 if you had relatives, for example, in the United States, and\nthey had poor people, or people who ran out of money, or had \u2014 didn\u2019t have jobs, to\ntry to help the people in Vienna.

There\u2019s a\nblack market thing going on and you would have to pay 20 marks for one dollar.\nAnd this way \u2014 my parents would give money out that way to people who really\nneeded it, and the relatives who \u2014 to put some money into a bank account in \u2014 in\nNew York, that my parents had.",
        "A: Yes. Was somebody that yes, I think they probably did establish some bank\naccount. So when we came to the United States, there was some money that\nallowed us \u2014 that allowed my par \u2014 [Il tell you about that later.",
        "A: Well, I remember coming back from my \u2014 as I mentioned before, coming back\nfrom vacation and going back to school, and knowing what was going on politically,\non the outside, and that there was all the \u2014 there were all these demonstrations. Then\nin March \u2014 was it February \u2014 February, March, that the \u2014 the \u2014 the one Saturday\nmorning, the negotiations stopped, and the German army marched into Austria, and\nAustria became part of the German Reich.",

        "A: Yes. My parents kept me at home. We didn\u2019t know what to really expect. Things\non the radio, you know, warned you \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any private radio, or the radio\nwas controlled by the government, there was one station. No TV, of course, and we\nwere told to stay at home. There were all kinds of warnings given out. The \u2014 I think\nit must have been on a Saturday, and the German army marched in.",
        "A: It\u2019s over the radio, it was over the radio. And of course, I mean, words traveled in\nbetween people, and friends and relatives and \u2014 so you heard this really changed\nfrom a\u2014 it was expected, you know, it wasn\u2019t anything that surprised people, except\nit shocked everybody. So, many of my friends went out to the Rykestrasse, it was\njust a main drag in Vienna in the first district, on which all museums or parliament\nand the opera, and all the \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s where wos \u2014 it\u2019s like Champs Elysees in\nParis, it\u2019s a six \u2014 six or eight or 10, or I think in \u2014 avenues, like very wide and dep \u2014\nso there was a parade there of the German \u2014 as the German army marched in.",
        "A: No, no, I was at \u2014 two weeks later [indecipherable]\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Some were ja \u2014 yes, but they were \u2014 did not live \u2014 what hap \u2014 to \u2014 one friend that\nlived next building to us, who was about eight months older than me, or a year older,\nand the rest of them were not Jewish. The [indecipherable] friends I had lived next\ndistrict, in the second district, what a \u2014 18\" district, or \u2014 or were school friends that\ndid not live where I lived. So there was one or two Jewish, I think one that I was\nclose to. I still remember his name, Leo Schickler(ph), and we were kept at home\ntha-that day. So, things changed very rapidly. I was told that our school would stop;\nJewish kids would no longer go to school after summer vacation. I mean, July, we \u2014\nwe were all kicked out. At \u2014 what happened at that particular time, the \u2014 the\nimmensity of the political change really did move very fast, but it was not at that to\n\u2014 time, life threatening. It wasn\u2019t a point that I would get beat up on the street, or\nwould get arrested. So, what really happened to begin with, that small Jewish\nbusinesses, of which there were many in \u2014 in Vienna, you know, haberdashery\nstores, or grocery stores, or what the case may be, all the graffiti was to be painted\non their windows, don\u2019t buy here, Juden, it would say, or they would have the star\nJew \u2014 you know, Star of David painted on the windows, or they would \u2014 they would\nput an SA guy as a Brownshirt, you know, semi-military person in front of the store\nand discourage people from walking in.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yes. It was scary. The \u2014 I could tell you what \u2014 what kind of threw me off. I used\nto read quite a few books and I belonged to a private library, and so I went to return\na book to the library, and want to take out another book, and they told me that I\ncould no longer have a membership there. And I was startled, and I said why? Well,\nhe said, you\u2019re Jewish and we cannot any more allow you to be a member here. I\nwas in \u2014 I think of all the things I\u2019ve no longer been able to go to the movie, or to\nstand on a railroad ca \u2014 excuse me, on a streetcar, rather than sitting down, or that \u2014\nthat was long before Jews were forced to wear a Jewish star, you know, on their\ngarments. We had no identification except everybody wore a swastika in their lapel,\nexcept the Jews. So I was, you know, you\u2019re easily recognized.",
        "A: You were Jewish.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",

        "A: \u2014 you know, the early Nazis had a number on their swastika emblem, and they\nhad a red \u2014 it was red and black, and it was a \u2014 with a swastika in the middle, so you\nknew they were party members, and that there were others. But everyone wore a\nswastika except \u2014 if I would have been caught wearing a swastika, I don\u2019t know\nwhat could have happened. So Jews didn\u2019t do that. They were not allowed.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. We had some neighbor friends, to \u2014 my parents did. I\nlater found out that they were very helpful to my parents, and I\u2019Il mention that later,\nbecause I returned, you know, to Vienna as a soldier. And then later my mother\nwould say, and she sent me money to give out, American dollars. I went to \u2014 to our\nold building and I knocked on doors, and I dished out like hundred dollar bills on\nmy visit there, to certain people that Mother \u2014 my mother gave me names, who were\nhelpful, who were \u2014",

And they used them for\nper \u2014 for \u2014 for person \u2014 not person, for putting in Jewish men [coughs] excuse me \u2014\nJewish men into arrest, because they filled up all the prisons. If there were 240 some\nodd thousand Jewish families, I would say there must have been a substantial\nnumber of Jewish men. And they didn\u2019t catch everybody. Whoever was \u2014 like my\nfather, we were not very smart sp \u2014 staying home, but if he would have been hidden\nby someone, or gone to a non-Jewish neighbor or friend, they never would have\nDecember 2, 2011\nfound him. So, because it was all done, they burned down every synagogue on\nNovember the ninth and 10\", and \u2014 and then by the 11\" and 12, it just \u2014 they\narrested so many people they had no room, and th \u2014 1t overwhelmed them. My father\nwas \u2014 we found out that somebody said they saw him carrying out \u2014 the field\nkitchen, helping carry out a big pot, which they fed, at one of the closed schools\nwher-where we lived, in the same district. So we rushed over there, and sure enough\nwe saw my dad carry out a big \u2014 a \u2014 with another man, a big pot, you fill it up with\nfood or soup or whatever it was, from \u2014 it was \u2014 the field kitchen was on the \u2014 you\nknow, on the street, and a lot of people smelling around, watching and trying to find\ntheir relatives.

It must be somewheres around, I don\u2019t know. I hope I kept it.\nI don\u2019t know where it is.

        "A: He was 40 years old. He was a young man.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: And so he was strong, he was \u2014 he was \u2014 I\u2019m looking here, I have a picture of\nhim here in my o \u2014 I\u2019m sitting in my offi \u2014I have an office in my home, and \u2014 and\nthere were people that were 70 - 75 years old, who couldn\u2019t stay, you know, who\ndied, on the short trip \u2014",
        "A: Yes, on the transit. And he said that was very, very terrible. He would ra \u2014 never\nspeak, or try. Never \u2014 I tried to, and he didn\u2019t want to talk about his in \u2014 being\nincarcerated into Dachau.",
        "A: No. The ride, nor about Dachau.",
        "A: Was very unpleasant. He told me one thing \u2014 no, he didn\u2019t tell me this, I heard it\nfrom a relative of ours who was in the same barracks as he was. My father was very\namb \u2014 he was a \u2014 he was a very hard worker, and very conscientious about what he\ndid. And this is what I heard; he would never tell me that. He washed handkerchiefs,\nhe washed rags in \u2014 you know, where water was available at night, during the night,\nfor people. A rag in your pocket was probably the most important possession. Every\nmorning they \u2014 all the prisoners were in mass formation, like six o\u2019clock or 5:30 in\nDecember 2, 2011\nthe morning, standing out there, you know, by barracks, and they would count them\noff and make sure that nobody escaped, which was a \u2014 which was a lot of bull, but\nthey kept this discipline in this thing. And as a matter of fact, my friend who was\narrested was a year older than me, lived next door to us \u2014 I mean, next building to\nus, Leo Schickler(ph) his name was, also told me his experience, you know, in the\nmorning. And they would say that barracks number 104 can go to the latrine at 10\no\u2019clock at night. No other time. And everybody, every barracks was assigned a\ncertain time to go to the bathroom, to relieve themselves. And there was a lot of\ndysentery, so people couldn\u2019t control their bodily functions. And they would have to\nwait. So they would, you know, make up and make it in pa \u2014 in the pants. And they\nneeded to have a rag to wipe themselves with. And that was very important\npossession. And then at night, they would \u2014 he would help people who we-were\nincapable of doing it, to wash their rags. I heard that from another person that \u2014\nabout my dad.",
        "A: He did it for a lot of people.",
        "A: Well, he tells me that story, my friend \u2014 this is fore be \u2014 before penicillin and we\nall, including me, always had earaches, very early in \u2014 you know, the de \u2014 there was\nDecember 2, 2011\nno \u2014 you just to outgrow something, you \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, but we all had\nearaches when we grew up. And he was a year older than I, and he was standing in\nformation at five or six o\u2019clock in the morning, and \u2014 and a guard came by, you\nknow, the counting off, and he said anybody \u2014 he said, anybody needs to go to the \u2014\nto see a doctor, what is it, to \u2014 to the \u2014 what am I thinking of, what word?",
        "A: Yeah, clinic, clinic \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 whatever they had, yeah. And he raised his hand, and he said, what\u2019s wrong \u2014\nand a guard came over to him, and he says, number \u2014 had a number, didn\u2019t call you\nby name, called you by number. He says, what\u2019s wrong? And he says, I have an\nearache very bad, and I need something, terrible. He says, which ear, and he show \u2014\npoints to his right ear. And the guy takes the stock of his rifle and smashes it across\nhis right ear, knocks him unconscious. He says, now this will help you, ther \u2014 it will\nstop hurting. It was little things like that \u2014",
        "A: And I figured you know, and then \u2014 and then the rest of them didn\u2019t want to talk\nabout. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it just seems almost unbelievable that a culture or a \u2014 you know, a\ncivilized people would have members in their midst who would carry out these\nDecember 2, 2011\nterrible things. And you know, and particularly Germany that, you know, has a rich\nhistory of democracy and civil \u2014 and scholarship and education and health care and\nall the other things that took place in the 18\" and 19\" century, would \u2014 would be\nable to change a people to these murderers, and unbelievably s \u2014 without conscience\ntype of animals. I mean, they lost all their sense of value, and sense of humanity.\nAnd that always puzzles me. I\u2019ve had some discussions on that when I talked to\nsome German soldiers, you know, that we \u2014 in \u2014 that we had in our \u2014 we picked up,\nand \u2014 when I was overseas. All right, so that was \u2014 now I will tell you how we got\nmy dad out.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yes.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t quite recall the panic, or the helplessness, cause I don\u2019t remember\nthat. I just tried very hard to try to figure out what did it really feel like. And what I\nwas really doing. Well, in the meantime, there were some Jewish organizations and\nsome Americans that came to, or were in Vienna and established some trains, and\npicked up where the public schools left off. I was given a choice to \u2014 to learn a trade.\nSo I was 15 years old. And I was assigned to a Jewish dentist, who could only do \u2014\ntreat Jewish patients, and became his assistant. I would, you know, mix plaster of\nParis and help make false teeth, now, you know, to put people\u2019s \u2014 that had problems\nwith their dentures and other things like that, and I would assist this and learn how\nto give the right instrument to this \u2014",
        "A: And that was a Jewish je \u2014 single, young man who was a doctor, and I was\nassigned to be his assi \u2014 learn the trade, as a mit \u2014 as a dental mechanic, or whatever\nit was called, and \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t go to school, there was no school for Jewish\nchildren.",
        "A: It was a big \u2014 I have a picture of \u2014 someplace, of the sign, his sign on the outside\nof \u2014 of this apartment building. Big sign, with a Jewish star on it, and it says, you\nDecember 2, 2011\nknow, it gives his name, being a dentist, and underneath it said, only Jewish patients,\nhe could not treat anybody else. And I worked for him maybe for \u2014 this is a time that\nmy father was gone, and so that must have taken some \u2014 some of the hurt and guilt\nfeelings and uncertainties away from me, you know, learning a trade, or learning a\nprofession.",
        "A: Yes, I think there must have been, and I don\u2019t quite \u2014 I don\u2019t remember whether I\nchose it, or they told me that\u2019s what I have to do, or here\u2019s my chance to do it. His\noffice was not very far away from where we lived, so I could walk there in the\nmorning, and \u2014",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: I\u2014I could point it out to you. I don\u2019t remember the name of the street, 1t was on\n\u2014 my \u2014 you know, my German is really \u2014 it has disappeared quite \u2014 quite a bit. Let\nme just think. There is a danuk(ph) \u2014 have you ever been in Vienna?",
        "A: Okay, there is a\u2014 a river that runs through the city \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 and it\u2019s like the canal, the Danube canal, it\u2019s a \u2014 they had \u2014 it\u2019s an artificial\nthing. It\u2019s not the Danube, the Danube is on the outskirts of Vienna, but it\u2019s in the\ninner city. And my \u2014 then there is a \u2014 between the first and the 20\" district, ther \u2014 th-\ntha-that Danube canal runs. And next to it is a park that runs along the river, with\nbenches and trees. And my grandparents\u2019 apartment was \u2014 it was called the Lande,\nl-a-n-d-e, with an umlaut \u2014 with that umlaut over the A. And his \u2014 they \u2014 he was\nabout a block away or a few buildings away, the dentist, from where my\ngrandparents had lived, in this very, very nice apartment, on the Lande. So \u2014",
        "A: Every bench. I\u2019ve gotta tell you, because this \u2014 about \u2014 you asked me. When I got\nout of school, gymnasium, there was a park called the Augarten, which is a very\nlarge park. It is part of \u2014 was right next to the exit of my gymnasium, and the kids\nwould meet out there after school, and there were benches in that park. Every bench,\nin every park in Vienna was immediately, they have stenciled on the back of each\none, Juden verboten. Jews \u2014 Jews cannot sit on a bench. Now, I\u2019ve been in Vienna\nfour or five, maybe six times, and I\u2019ve been riding my bike someti \u2014 there\u2019s a bike\npath that runs from Germany into Vienna and I\u2019ve been on that a few times with\nmy bicycle, and \u2014 and some time it occurred to me what I have to do is go to this\nDecember 2, 2011\npark where they \u2014 every bench said Juden verboten, I would sit on these bench \u2014 I\nsat on eight benches there in a half hour, just to get even with them.",
        "A: I think it was about three, four years ago. And I think people sitting there,\nlooking like I was crazy. And anyways, I felt I had to do that.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I felt insecure. I fa \u2014 if I see a group of young people, men, you know, boys,\ntravel \u2014 who are walking, you know, they\u2019re with four or five, six together. I would\nfind a \u2014 out pretty quick \u2014 I was running, I was a\u2014I was on a track team in my\ngymnasium also. So I was little \u2014 I was somewhat athletic. And \u2014 so I would find\nsomeplace that I could disappear, or run, or make sure I don\u2019t cross that path.",
        "A: There was no star.",
        "A: Never. No, no, we left before the star became law.",
        "A: I would tra \u2014 yes, they would \u2014 I would be threatened, or I would be beat up, or\nwould had some confrontation, and I tried to avoid that.",
        "A: Well, they knew it would \u2014 I mean, the first thing is \u2014 I should ste \u2014 send you a\npicture, do I look Jewish? I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly it. I didn\u2019t wear a swastika in my lapel, an-and \u2014 and I have curly\nhair, to this very day. And \u2014 and I think that maybe I do look \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I look\nJewish or not. I think in the United States I don\u2019t, but I think in Austria I may have.\nAnd you know, I was 14 - 15 years old. So it \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I knew it was going to happen, I would get confrontation.",
        "A: They would, you know, call me names, dirty Jew, or this and that. And at this\ntime I was very sensitive to that. I had \u2014 I did have a number of non-Jewish friends\nwho were very \u2014 who really stuck with me, very early in the game. And I \u2014 when I\nDecember 2, 2011\nwent with them, was no problem. But my mother was not very happy that I would\ngo to places I shouldn\u2019t be.",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to a movie, and I did sneak in a few times. I-I think\nthere are certain places that \u2014 where Jews were not allowed, a park. I did not sick on\na park \u2014 I did not sit on a park bench until that episode I mentioned. And I was very\nsensitive and really very careful on how \u2014 what my behavior was, and that almost\nany time I walked or went someplace, I was very, very \u2014 I knew I was very\nvulnerable, and I was very careful about doing things.",
        "A: Well, how do I \u2014 okay, there was a famous Jewish \u2014 that\u2019s not \u2014 I\u2019m sorry,\nfamous German author called Karl May. Ever hear of him?",
        "A: He wrote 64 books, each one four, five, 600 pages, I\u2019ve \u2014 I think I read every one\nof them. And he wrote about America and about the Indians and the trappers and\nthe west \u2014 the American west, the \u2014 he had heroes like Winnetou and Old\nShatterhand \u2014\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Okay. I read every one of the books. And it \u2014 he really \u2014 and the guy never left\nGermany. He \u2014 all out of his head. As a matter of fact, two of my friends and I, we\ndecided to revisit some of our last \u2014 was it two years ago, we went to Paris and\nBerlin and \u2014 and Vienna, and doing kind of some spots from the second World\nWar, and they\u2019re both veterans. And we stopped in Berlin for a week, and they had\nan ex \u2014 they had a special exhibition at one of the museums, the city museum of\nBerlin, of Karl May. He was a faker, you know, but he wrote the books that to this\nvery day are very popular, a hundred years later, still very popular in Germany. It\u2019s\nall about America, the American west, Indians and trappers and the whole thing. So\nI was big fan of that. As a matter of fact, once one of my teachers asked my mom to\ncome to school because te \u2014 she felt I was reading too many of those books. So I had\nthat little adventure seed planted into me. So it became a game to me a little bit, of\navoiding being \u2014 you know, meeting someone that \u2014 with whom I would have a\nconfrontation. And having \u2014 and living in an area which there were mostly non-\nJews. I was used to that, and the people were somewhat protective of us wher-where\nwe lived. I don\u2019t ever remember being threatened or \u2014 except that one thing of our\ncleaning lady coming and then demanding money from my mom.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: And our neighbors \u2014 our neighbors were very, very \u2014 they didn\u2019t go out of their\nway, they didn\u2019t ou \u2014 they didn\u2019t violate any of the Nazi laws, but they were\nprotective of us.",
        "A: I have to think about that. I think it was after they took my father away.\n[indecipherable] that my mother was \u2014 she was very strong, she was really\ndetermined. And she \u2014 we got my \u2014 I got \u2014 we got my dad out of \u2014",
        "A: Dachau.",
        "A: I think she very \u2014 she became very careful, and very sensitive to what was going\non and wan-wanted to make certain that I don\u2019t make any waves, or to open up my\nmouth and say the wrong things.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I think it\u2019s primarily the environment she created, probably more than\nanything else. She was a gutsy lady, she was very smart. And not because she was\nmy mom, and I\u2019Il \u2014 it\u2019Il come as I tell you my story, but she \u2014 she had her \u2014 her feet\non the ground almost all the time. She never panicked. And there was plenty of\nopportunities to panic.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, they all did.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s my phone, so don\u2019t worry about that.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: No, then I'll lose you.",
        "A: Yeah, they\u2019ll call, I'll leave a message.",
        "A: Ah, 11 o\u2019clock here. Give me your question again?",
        "A: I don\u2019t quite say [indecipherable] I think they all wore swastikas, I can\u2019t swear\non that. But I think that was the \u2014 that was the law. That was to be able to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nsurvive, to be \u2014 you know, the whole country took on an entire different look. Go\nand see that film that \u2014 that is \u2014 you have in your library, about Vienna. It\u2019s a 10\nminute film \u2014 if I have it handy here \u2014 no, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s someplace here in my office.\nAnd, I could look at it. And you have it. And it shows you the enthusiasm, and the \u2014\nthis 1s in March of 19 \u2014 or April second of 1938 when Hitler first comes back into\nVienna and \u2014 and the whole town goes berserk. So you have this \u2014 the ab \u2014 the\nunbelievable propaganda machine working with such efficiency and dedication to\nturn the whole culture around. This was the ability that they were able to do. I mean,\nif you go \u2014 you were in an environment where you see all the shoes and all the\nluggage and all the boxcars and \u2014 in your mu \u2014 in the museum. And you say, how do\nthe civilized and \u2014 civilized people do that? And here\u2019s a guy, you know, here\u2019s that\nDecember 2, 2011\n\u2014 that \u2014 that believe this \u2014 this unbelievable corruption of morality and ethics and\nhumanity and everything that we have been taught to believe in as we live on this\nearth, go to pot. So you see that tremendous change that takes place within people\nthat just \u2014 to this very day I don\u2019t quite understand it, how a normal, civilized people\ngo and kill people, or put them into a gas chamber.",
        "A: Yes, they did, I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: But you see, you \u2014 you \u2014 here\u2019s what happens. Yeah, I \u2014 you know, I\u2019m an anti-\nSemite, but you are my \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re my Jewish friend.

The \u2014 the major things that \u2014 that one was thinking about was well,\nhow do we get out of here? What do we do, what\u2019s the future? How do I get my\nfather out of Dachau, what has to be done, you know, how are we \u2014 what\u2019s our\nfuture going to be? I can\u2019t go to school any more, or I\u2019m now working for a dentist,\nor \u2014 so he \u2014 your values system takes a dive, and all the things you\u2019ve been taught\njust absolutely disappear.",
        "A: Well, that was going over the \u2014 because we had applied very early, my \u2014 either\nmy dad or my mom went to the American embassy and put our name on the list.\nAnd then we received an affidavit from relative of ours, that lived in Cincinnati,\nwhom I never met, who sent us an affidavit.",
        "A: 1930 \u2014 must have been in 1930 \u2014 the end of \u201937, or to be \u2014 or the first month in \u2014\nor January 1938 that they went to the American embassy and they said well, you\nhave \u2014 you put your name here, on the list, because there\u2019s a waiting list that once\nyou get your affidavit, before, we going to issue visas depending upon when your\nname appeared on this list. So that name didn\u2019t appear on this list until November\nDecember 2, 2011\n1939. That\u2019s our names. And that was \u2014 it had to be very early, before the Nazi\ntakeover of Austria.

But anyways, my\nmom and I went to see his uncle. He had a travel agency. And he said, there are\nways to get out of \u2014 of Austria to go to \u2014 I think I mentioned that, to go to China, to\nShanghai. And he fou \u2014 and he sold some tickets to some Jewish people. And\n[indecipherable] the whole thing, it\u2019s just my mother, you know, were talking. And\nI said to her, listen to this, and when she tells him that we can\u2019t leave, because my\nDecember 2, 2011\nfather is in Dachau, and we\u2019re not gonna leave and leave my father in Dachau. And\nhe said, oh. He says he\u2019s gonna find out who has responsibilities, or who is involved\nwith Dachau. And he was pretty high up in the es \u2014 this hierarchy, the Brownshirts.",
        "A: Beg your pardon \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 remember his name at all.",
        "A: I just remember what he looked like. And you come back to this \u2014 we met at his\noffice, and my friend was there, and his father, who was a brother to this big shot in\nthe Nazi party. Now, to be a big shot in the Nazi party, you had to be an \u2014 a member\nof the Nazi party for a long time, during the time that it was illegal. So this guy must\nhave been \u2014 for many years been a Nazi, which doesn\u2019t sit very pleasant with us \u2014\npleasantly. So we came back, I think a week or two later, and he found out that if we\ncould go to that \u2014 he found out who has responsibility of the Dachau inmates that\nwere arrested in Vienna, and it\u2019s an SS officer that has a desk at the Metropole\nHotel in first district on Rudolfsplatz(ph) and he was going to make an appointment\nwith \u2014 for my mother to meet this officer, and find out what has to be done, if we\ncould get my father out of camp. He said to us that we, I think, have to show proof\nthat we would leave within a very short time. So where would we go? You know,\nEurope at that time, almost every border was closed. My mother had an ex \u2014 old\nDecember 2, 2011\nboyfriend who was English Jewish person, that she was, I think seeing romantically,\nor just a good friend, before she married. And he was a British officer by this time,\nJewish fellow.",
        "A: No. I should. Some are \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 they\u2019ll be someplace. I may have to think up these things in my\ndocuments that I haven\u2019t had the energy to kind of go my \u2014 down the basement and\nstart \u2014 we\u2019re getting rid of things, you know, and not fast enough. So, we didn\u2019t \u2014 I\nmean, that \u2014 that developed itself later in Israel, but so he made an appointment\nwith \u2014 for my mother to see this guy at the \u2014 at the headquarters of the Gestapo.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: Because he was an uncle to my friend that I went to school with. The \u2014 remember\nI met him on the street \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and he brought me to his uncle.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: I also think \u2014 know that there was some money passed.",
        "A: We are \u2014 he sold \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m not sure about this, and I can\u2019t really pr \u2014 take \u2014 swore\non it, but I think that my mother bought three tickets on a boat to go to China from\nhim; he had \u2014 he owned a travel agency. So \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure about it, but I think\nthis has something to do with it. So all this conversation took place, and\nappointments were made and \u2014 now let\u2019s see, what did I forget? And there was a\nquestion about getting a visa that was \u2014 visas sold illegally by a embass \u2014 a Chinese\nembassy official who \u2014 who wasn\u2019t supposed to do it, but sold permits to go to\nShanghai from Vienna, and also, it was done out of Germany. So that\u2019s, you\nknow, a number of people, Jewish people landed up in Shanghai, and later found\nout they were \u2014 they \u2014 they sold those to make money, and it was not a policy of the\nChinese government. But the \u2014 they did s-save a number of Jewish families.",
        "A: I know two of them here, that lived in Des Moines.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: For us?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, because my mother still was dishing out money to people who\nhad no money.",
        "A: It was kind of a unofficial done, you know, that things happened when \u2014 when\npanic strikes, that people find ways of doing things. It was not official. I don\u2019t think\nit was an organization like HIAS or anything like that. Be \u2014 was that somebody had\nre \u2014 a relative in \u2014 in New York, and \u2014 who had money, or was willing to help this\nperson living in Vienna who had no money. So they would say if \u2014 if the official\nexchange of marks \u2014 used to be shillings and then it became German marks, was\nfive marks to the d \u2014 10 marks to the dollar \u2014 I\u2019ve forgotten what the exchange rate\nwas, the black market would pay 20 marks to a person in \u2014 1n Vienna, instead of 10.\nSo it paid for the relative to deal to that black market, or whatever it was called, to\nthat conduit. And so if you had money and you lived in Vienna, and you \u2014 there\nwere Jewish people who had no money, and they need to buy groceries. And they\nhad relatives that would give \u2014 who would contribute some money. So that\u2019s why I\nthink \u2014 where the money flow went, back and forth.\nDecember 2, 2011",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not much \u2014 some stuck and some didn\u2019t. So it\u2019s \u2014 our parents lost quite a bit of \u2014\nmy parents lost quite a bit of money in the transactions, I guess. So, where was I?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh, she made appointment, and he sold three sh \u2014 steamship tickets, so that\u2019s\nhow he made money, to my mother to go to China, once my dad was \u2014 and then we\nhad to get a visa from a Chinese embassy, and I don\u2019t know if that was done or not.\nIt was almost a way of, you know, paying off the guy. So she went through the\nHotel Metropole. I went with her, but I stayed outside, I remember that. And there\nwas a big line-up outside of people waiting. They had people in \u2014 in prison and\ntortured at that building, down in the basement. The building, last time I was in\nVienna it no longer existed, but they did put a monument there, just historically,\nwhat \u2014 that the Gestapo headquarters was there. And my mom was ushered in, after\nwaiting in line for a couple hours or more, and she always described this, she was\nDecember 2, 2011\nvery \u2014 she had a wonderful memory, and one of \u2014 my lawyer here in town 1s a\nfellow named David Bellon(ph) [indecipherable] he was also on the Warren\nCommission, and very \u2014 became very prominent nationally, you know\n[indecipherable]. Unfortunately, he died, but was also a close friend of mine. And\nhe heard my mother\u2019s story and \u2014 and he wanted to record \u2014 record that part where\nshe told the details of her visit at the Gestapo, with the black uniform, and the heil\nHitlers and the \u2014 and everybody was throwing out their arm, and you know, heil\nHitler, and it \u2014 and clicking their heels, and she went to \u2014 so finally met the guy,\nand the guy interviewed for about two hours, and then asked her to come back, she\ncame \u2014 we went back, same old thing and he said to her, he would release my father.\nThere was no money exchanged at all, and it was on the \u2014 really on the push of my\nfriend\u2019s uncle, who was a friend of this Gestapo guy. And he would come out in\nabout two weeks, three weeks. And he \u2014 she has to bring him to meet \u2014 to meet \u2014 he\nwanted to meet my dad.",

        "A: Yeah. And she says to Gestapo officer, why do you want to meet my husband?\nHe sees enough of black uniforms in Dachau. And he \u2014 he said, I want to know\nwhat kind of a man marries such a woman like you. So she always told that story,\nwhat the Gestapo officer \u2014 you know, she was a gutsy lady and she was very\narticulate and was able to convince this guy. So, sure enough, my dad come out \u2014",
        "A: It had to be, I would guess July, August, maybe later, September. I can\u2019t\nremember, I have to go really \u2014",

He had \u2014 never wanted to go on vacation,\nhe never wanted \u2014 he wanted to work. He had guilt feelings, survivor\u2019s kind of why\nwas he had the privilege of getting out of Dachau, and other people died there. That\nbothered him a great, great deal. So he had these \u2014 which was not uncommon type of\nDecember 2, 2011\nguilt feelings, of been able to have got out, wh-when he \u2014 people that he knew never\nmade it out of there.",
        "A: Yeah, but at that time \u2014 as a matter of fact, one of my other closest friend that I\nwent to school with, to \u2014 Jewish \u2014 his father was the concertmaster for the Des\nMoines \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m si\u2014 Des Moines, but the Vienna Philharmonic and also a\nprofessor of vi\u2014 violin, you see, well-known violinist.",

And he \u2014\nI\u2019m just gonna give you a sideline. I was taking basic \u2014 infantry basic training in\nCamp Croft in 1943. And I was assigned to a group of people they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with. I think our I.Q. had something to do with it, and not being a citizen,\nI was just in this country four years, and I was in there with people that were much\nsmarter than me, that \u2014 some of them older, substantial, were all born not in the\nDecember 2, 2011\nUnited States. And people in the music business who escaped out of Germany and\nAustria. Zero Mostel was in my barracks, you remember him?",
        "A: Who he was?",
        "A: Okay. And so I\u2019m sitting outside one day after whatever training I went through\nthat day, and I became an infantry \u2014 I became a machine gun \u2014 what the \u2014 rifleman\nand machine gun. That was my spec. I see this guy looks familiar walking across the\ncommon and I recognize, oh my God, that\u2019s Irving Geringer. I si \u2014 hollered at him,\nIrving, Irving, is that you? Sure enough he turns around, it\u2019s him. He \u2014 he was a\nbrilliant guy; I think his I.Q. must have been 160 or so, and they put him as the\nhistorical section for the Fifth Army. So we landed \u2014 we move \u2014 when we are\nshipped overseas into North Africa and then into Italy, he also got shipped over,\nand he ran the historic section for the Fifth Army, so he wrote a book about the\ncampaign.

And they lived on Gramercy Park,\nwhich is like 23rd Street and Fifth Ave. \u2014 23\u2019 \u2014 Second Avenue in New York\nCity. And I spent a lot of time with them when I came out of the army.

So,\nthe \u2014 and his dad \u2014 well, why do I mention it? Because his dad also was arrested and\nwas \u2014 spent time, and they got him out also.

Less and less Jewish business existed, you know, with graffiti\non their windows, they were all taken over. People lost their fortunes. Rich people\nwere able to get out very early, the Rothschilds, and whoever they all \u2014 the other\npeople were, the Blochs(ph) and so on. And they took over their palaces and their\nfacilities and confiscated most of their wealth and paintings, and I \u2014 really got tough.\nAnd in the meantime my dad would go out to the police, get an extension. And we\nwould go pretty often to \u2014 not I, but mom and dad \u2014 to the American embassy to\nfind out where we were on that list. It looked more and more that we had a chance to\nreally go to America. And finally, our visa came \u2014 not visa, but our number came\nup, and we were able to get the visa in November to departure in that wa \u2014 I think it\ncame up in October, for us to leave in November.

And my \u2014 our\nDecember 2, 2011\nrelatives were at the dock. I never forgotten, never, that in \u2014 I was always thankful\nthat the ship did not dock. It stayed outside the harbor in New York City. And\nEurope at that time was in [indecipherable] blacked out. Couldn\u2019t think of it. There\nwere no lights at night.

The war was on, they were\nalways afraid of bombings, so every light at night at \u2014 wherever it was, whether it\nwas Berlin or Vienna or anyplace else, were totally, totally blacked out. And a ship\ndocked, came there in the evening of whatever that date was in November, and it\ndocked on the other side that later became the Verrazano bridge.

And one of the greatest thing happened to me, that I got\ndrafted. And I, it turn out, was in the army for close to three years. And it was the\nbest thing that happened to me, and it really \u2014 it established my self-worth and \u2014 and\nI became an American.\nDecember 2, 2011",

At that kind of got \u2014 convinced me, 1n order\nfor me to forget about that I came from Vienna, that I came from Austria, and to be\nan American, just like everybody else, I had to learn English.

So, I think that\u2019s what it was,\nand to this very day, you know, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m pres \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m on \u2014 I\u2019m the\nonly Jewish member of a Methodist college called Citizen College. I\u2019m trying to\nfind somebody else that\u2019s Jewish that would serve on the board here. And I \u2014 and I\nwas pretty participatory in many other organizations. So I think all that may have\nbeen, if you really cut it deep into my \u2014 my own emotional, I guess deeds or\ninadequacies, I think that helped me a great deal.",
        "A: Yeah, but I \u2014 you know, maybe I should have gone for therapy sometimes.",
        "A: I know \u2014 no, I\u2019ve figured out you know, I had the \u2014 a couple of friends of mine\nwho were psychiatrists and \u2014 and I always remember one time we were at a dinner\nand I was sitting next to one of the \u2014 one of the physicians who was very quiet, but\nhe was a \u2014 a therapist. And he turns to me, he says \u2014 and \u2014 and I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m kind of,\nvery social, and he turns to me, he says, you really are \u2014 Fred, you rece \u2014 you\u2019re so\nsocial because you\u2019re really an introvert.\nDecember 8, 2011",
        "A: It shocked me, oh, it sho \u2014 it shocked me.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: I think probably I\u2019m overcompensating. I think so. I think that\u2019s what motivated\nme. You know, I took this job and I became president, it was a very \u2014 what do I say,\na very American company, and I became president of the company. Never planned\nit to me. I went to \u2014 then I also bought \u2014 I left the company after I was president and\nbought an interest in another company, and I s-started another company with a\ncouple of immigrants, Russian immigrants, which they still work \u2014 still running\nhere in \u2014 in I \u2014 in Des Moines, now owned by a large syndicate, and has about 300\nemployees. And two Russians were started in business, because I was, at that time I\nthink, president of the Jewish Federation, and I went to the airport to greet two 1m \u2014\nwhen we took at \u2014 every community at that time, took it upon themselves to resettle\nsome Russian Jews that were able to get out of Russia where there was a lot of anti-\nSemitism at that time in the Soviet Union.",
        "A: Ah, it has \u2014 it had to be 1940 \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, 1970 \u2014 \u201973 or \u201974. So what happened\nwas, I went to the airport to greet them, in \u2014 on behalf of the Jewish community,\n100December 8, 2011\ntwo couples. Should I share that with you?",
        "A: Okay. One couple was SteralzesIsky(ph), the other was Ruchstein(ph), they\nwere both engineers. One wife was a physician and the other wife a concert pianist.\nAnd I was taken with them immediately, because I somehow superimposed myself\ninto their situation, I guess: new immigrants, well-educated, talented. And I got\nthem jobs, and \u2014 at a engineering company, they were both engineers, the men. One\nwife was a physician, the other wife a pianist, a \u2014 played at the Kir-Kirov-Kirov \u2014\nKirov Opera Company in Leningrad, at that time, now St. Petersburg. And \u2014\nand I got to be very close to them, because these were the first immigrants we \u2014 that\nthe Jewish community took on upon themselves to settle them. We got them an\napartment, we \u2014 I got them English teachers, and found jobs for them. A friend of\nmine that was president of a steel company here and also was Jewish, I called him\nup and I says, you got \u2014 you know, got to help me. I have these two Russians, they\nvery \u2014 look like very smart engineers, they don\u2019t speak much English, I need jobs\nfor them. So he gave them the jobs. And I got fairly close to them, and my\nassociates at the business that I just was buying 1n, there\u2019s a father and son who\nowned that company, it\u2019s a company that was making quilted nylon fabrics in Des\nMoines and had another plant in Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas. And about six\nDecember 8, 2011\nmonths later, my friend who owned \u2014 excuse me, who was president of steel\ncompany called Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel called me up, he says, I\u2019m not doing\nthese two Russians any favors. I said, why? He said, well, they\u2019re to \u2014 two\nsophisticated engineers, and I should find them other jobs. So I met with them, and\nthey showed me patents, but I couldn\u2019t read them as done in Cyrillic Russian, and \u2014\nbut I could make out their names. So I went to my two partners and I said, why\ndon\u2019t we each put in some money and il \u2014 and \u2014 would \u2014 enough to kind of get a\nlawyer and get \u2014 get their \u2014 get their patents that they had in Russia registered in\nthe United States [indecipherable] on controlling any kind of liquid going through\npipelines, and through compressors and things like that, and they had figured out a\nsystem that would automatically control those compressors. So one thing that they\nmoved into my office, so I learned a little Russian, I listened to Russian music\n[indecipherable] little \u2014 little radios tuned into a Russian \u2014 I don\u2019t know how they\nheck they got the Russian station. So we became very good friends and we got them\ntheir patents and then my three \u2014 two partners and I put in each 25,000 dollars to get\nthem rolling. And that\u2019s when they moved into my office, I kind of forgot about\nthat. So that\u2019s \u2014 after 10 or 12 years of this \u2014\n102December 8, 2011",

        "A: \u2014 that they invested, and then \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want to sell the company, but my\ntwo other partners and \u2014 and now Mr. Ruzelski(ph) then became president, and he\nwanted to buy \u2014 he wanted \u2014 he had gotten a condo in [indecipherable] they had\nthe beautiful home in Palisades in New York, and \u2014 and Kahn(ph) was the other\none, in par \u2014 I mean, in \u2014 1n France.

That was he\nwas very \u2014 not very coordinated, believe it or not, at that time. He was heavy\noverweight, and everything was a joke with him.

And \u2014\nand I saw \u2014 I was so startled, you know, to meet someone from my gymnasium, my\nhigh school in Vienna, same company. And we spent men \u2014 much of our army time\ntogether.

His father became the concertmaster at the \u2014 which is the\nfirst chair in the orchestra \u2014 at the Metropolitan Opera Company. And so we went to\nthe opera very often, for free. And became kind of a steady guy at the Metropolitan\nOpera \u2014 that\u2019s when they were still down on 1407, which is 1407 Broadway, and\nthen they moved uptown to Lincoln Center, and we did \u2014 I still remember going,\nhow amazed we were [indecipherable] opera company, Irving and I did. We were\n\u2014 became very good fre \u2014 I gotta tell you a quick anec \u2014 ac \u2014 anecdote. Not\nanecdote, thing that happened to him and me. When the war ended, I moved up\nfrom Italy into \u2014 of \u2014 U-USF \u2014 US \u2014 US force \u2014 USFA. US Forces in Austria.\nThey apparently went through my \u2014 through, you know, my \u2014 every G.I. had that\nIBM card. I didn\u2019t have it, but they had it. We traveled with trucks 1n the wors \u2014 in\nworse environments, that had the first machines, IBM cards, they were \u2014 had holes\nin them. And they had these machines in the trucks, they\u2019re big, big \u2014 they were\nDecember 8, 2011\nvery big semis. And \u2014 and you \u2014 all your \u2014 your record and who you are, your\nnames, your schooling, your I.Q., whatever you did, was on that one card, it had\nholes in it. So if they want to pull the \u2014 that the army wanted to pull you up, because\nlooking for certain specialties that people may have, they would somehow run these\ncards through these machines, and itll come up. So, when the war ended, my outfit\nwas moved \u2014 was going to be moved back to the States, but then they redirected it\nto Japan \u2014 not to Japan, but to the Pacific. So, I got pulled out, and I always\nwondered how \u2014 why didn\u2019t I go with my outfit? So apparently my Viennese birth\nand my German knowledge, I landed up in US Forces in Austria, on the mar \u2014 on\nthe [indecipherable]. Then, he was the commanding general of the campaign in \u2014\nin Italy, that went from the bottom of the boot all the way up to the Po River,\nwhere I served all my military overseas. So then my friend Irving wrote the book\nabout the campaign, the Italian campaign. So, I-I find myself pulled out and sent to\na staging area and then I get orders that I am now part of USFA ma \u2014 US Forces in\nAustria. So I am the only really Viennese person in a contingent of about 200 - 300\nG.L.s that will make the invasion back in \u2014 not invasion, but because the Russians\ngot there before us, but reoccupation of Vienna.

I was so shocked when they read that to me and asked me if I\nwant to go, and I said absolutely not, I\u2019m an American and I want to stay here and I\nwant to train here and I want to stay in the American army. I have no desire to fight\nfor the Austrians.\n112December 8, 2011",

I now get assigned to overseas\nreplacement, no outfit, but the \u2014 I was called a \u2014 a replacement, going to a repo\ndepot. That was like where you waited, and then, for example, the third division, or\nthe 45\" or 36\", that was \u2014 is a fighting position in Italy. When they had casualties\nthey would put in a request for replacements. So that\u2019s what I was trained to be, a\nreplacement. So, on the way, to figure out that we\u2019re going overseas, from\nHampton Roads, Virginia, they find out I\u2019m not a citizen, the army. So they take\nme in Pennsylvania \u2014 we were a staging area, Camp Shenango, | still remember\nthat. And they find a federal judge \u2014 I\u2019m only in this country four years and to be a\ncitizen you have to be here five years, to be naturalized. And they convince a judge\nthat I have to ship overseas, and they need me overseas and I\u2019ve been trained, to\n113December 8, 2011\nmake me a citizen.

        "A: Unless I had to. I had this \u2014 and I\u2019m ashamed to tell you this, because things\nchange, that I truly \u2014 I was a \u2014 I\u2019d lorded it over them. I\u2019m a conqueror. They\n137December 8, 2011\nkicked me out. You know, this is a terrible, hurtful thing for us. My father was in\nDachau.",
        "A: We took \u2014 you know, we saw what happened to Austria, we see how the\nAustrians responded and what they did to the Jewish people.",
        "A: So [had this, you know, this feeling, and it translated itself, I think, in my\nbehavior.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 you know, I never told people that I\u2019m Austrian.",
        "A: I was an American, period. That\u2019s how far it went.",
        "A: No, I\u2014I just \u2014 I\u2019m like an observer. Really, you know, I was a\u2014 I wasn\u2019t even\nofficer, I was a s \u2014 you know, I was a sergeant. And so I didn\u2019t have much\nauthority. I had enough authority because of my uniform, and it was \u2014 you know, it\n\u2014 that was enough. So you had to be pretty careful about yourself, that it didn\u2019t run\naway with \u2014 with \u2014 with it. It wa \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult, I think, to describe what it\n138December 8, 2011\nfeels like to be a conqueror, or to be in a foreign country, even though to me it\nwasn\u2019t \u2014 Salzburg was no longer my country, it was \u2014 \u2019m an American. And that\nwas very important to me, to make this distinction. And I looked at it like an\nobserver. I didn\u2019t have a feeling any more for being a native of Austria, or have a\nsense of pride.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: No? You mean, the Americans, or the \u2014 the Germans?",
        "A: Well, there was [indecipherable] yes, they were very \u2014 I think they were very\nvulnerable. The ec \u2014 the economics were pretty bad. Food was not easily available.\nThe \u2014 the natives kind of did not really have a high profile, they kind of stuck to\ntheir homes. And you know, they saw the Nazis behavior. And I think there was a\ncertain amount of submerged \u2014 whatever they tell you that they didn\u2019t know what\nwas going on with the concentration camps and the gassing and all this, they knew\nit. So, I think in their own psyche, they felt this basic sense of insecurity, because\nthe German army, and the Austrian army, though it really was really part of the\n139December 8, 2011\nGerman army \u2014 and you know, if you go back in the history, more Austrians were\nassociated with the concentration camps than Germans. They were probably the\nworst anti-Semites. So you felt very, very \u2014 I think they were \u2014 they themselves\nknew what they did, and kept a low, low profile. And so, I really \u2014 my opportunity\nto talk to local people was really not that big.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. The \u2014 there \u2014 there was no questioning about the occupation.\nThe United States moved in there very \u2014 with lock, stock and barrel. I mean, we\nhad everything. We had food, we had \u2014 you know, had PXs, we had \u2014 we took over\nthe best hotels. We were \u2014 we were the conquerors. And we had strong feelings of\nsuperiority, subconsciously and consciously.",
        "A: So we made these people feel pretty small, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 and they if \u2014 and\nthe worse they behaved during the war, I think the more afraid they were.",
        "A: Yes, some. Wer \u2014 I never had any. I\u2019m trying to think why I never had any. I\nhand a girlfriend at home, and I was corresponding with her almost on a daily basis.\nYou know [indecipherable] V \u2014 V-letters. She\u2019s \u2014 my wife is a very wonderful\n140December 8, 2011\nwriter. She has a fantastic ability. She really should have been an author. She never\nreally pursued it, but she wrote the most beautiful letters. So I really was very much\nin love with her. And so really I had no \u2014 ever had any kind of relationship with any\nwoman. I\u2019m trying to think \u2014 not even, you know, I spoke the language.",
        "A: And I never \u2014 I never \u2014 never occurred to me. And the other thing, I think \u2014\nokay, I will tell you a story that \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I should really \u2014 okay. The \u2014\nthe \u2014 somehow, I had a sense of \u2014 was it discipline or morals or ethics, or whatever\nyou may want to call it, instilled to me by my parents. There was no deviation. I\nnever messed around with any woman. And \u2014 except one time. And that later came,\nbefore going home, that I had to get up on ship \u2014 I mean, I had no \u2014 no\nrelationships, but I got involved into a situation in Marseilles, France, which was\nvery strange. Now, if we have time I\u2019Il tell you about it \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and promise not to put it into my biography.",
        "A: Because it was so unusual, yeah, yes.\n141December 8, 2011",
        "A: And \u2014 and my wife, you know, everybody, all of my friends know that story, my\nwife knows the story. But anyways, up to that time, there wasn\u2019t anything that \u2014 that\nreally I felt was \u2014 somehow it never appeared, I \u2014 I can\u2019t remember. I can remember\nwhy I never had any attraction to any of the German or Austrian women, or Italian\nwomen. I did make the acquaintances of one Jewish woman in Naples, and she was\na violinist, and the only thing that we had was my love for music and her talent.\nAnd I went to her \u2014 with her a few \u2014 she was Jewish and she was a violinist and she\ngave recitals, and I went with her while I stayed in Naples, up to a few of her\nrecitals. And that was a f\u2014 one woman that I met and I helped her out a little bit\nwith food, what they were very short on at that particular time, with her mother.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think so. The \u2014 the women in Austria, particularly in Vienna.\nVienna was starved for men, because they either were in prisons, they were in\nstalags, or they were in \u2014 killed. And it was a shortage of male people when I got\ninto Vienna. The G.I.s were just having a ball.",
        "A: So, the Russians finally said okay, you come in. So that time was springtime,\nand my \u2014 one of my \u2014 and I can\u2019t \u2014 a-all I remember, this guy and I were assigned\n142December 8, 2011\nto this Jeep, or this Jeep was assigned to us. And we were in Linz at that time,\nwhich was the border between \u2014 we were waiting for the opportunity to get into \u2014\nacross the Russian zone. And they finally \u2014 th \u2014 we negotiated that \u2014 I didn\u2019t, but\nyou know, the army did, and got the signal to drive into Vienna and to take over\ncertain da \u2014I got places, and a list of places that we should take over, at which hotel\nwe should stay, and some apartments that were at one time held by some Nazi\nfunctionaries, to take over for our incoming troops. And only about 200 Americans\nto be \u2014 that were going into the first occupation. I think that\u2019s what the number was,\nbut don\u2019t pin me down on it, but I don\u2019t quite remember. So we got into our Jeep\nand got our stuff in the back. And I remember picking up a \u2014 a Russian officer, and\nwe offered him some cognac, and he \u2014 I think he drank that whole bottle, we just\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. And we got into Vienna at about \u2014 oh, must have been after\nlunch, something like one o\u2019clock or so, and the place was very few people. What\nhappened as we drove through the \u2014 from the suburbs in, that every time there was\nsome people walking and they saw us, they would duck into the closest building,\nwhere the doors were open maybe, you know, the gates.",
        "A: Apparently, they thought we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have much \u2014 I don\u2019t think we had any\nAmerican flag painted on our Jeep, or our uniforms didn\u2019t \u2014 weren\u2019t very\n143December 8, 2011\nrecognizable. I wore fatigues, so did my buddy. And I had my helmet packed in a\nbag, in my barracks bag, and \u2014 and on our way in I say to this fellow in the camp,\nhe was from \u2014 near Cincinnati \u2014 Covington \u2014 coving \u2014 Covington, Kentucky. I\nsays, I want to take you to my old neighborhood where I grew up. Want to do that?\nHe says, absolutely. So we \u2014 we \u2014 we kind of turned the Jeep into that direction.\nIt\u2019s like the suburb \u2014 not suburb, but next to the first district was where our district\nwas, not far walking distance to where the opera 1s, and the Ringstrasse \u2014 you ever\nbeen in Vienna?",
        "A: Have you?",
        "A: You did? So, not far. Even though it\u2019s the 20\" district, it was very close to the\nfirst district. We drive up on our street where our buil \u2014 where we sh \u2014 we s \u2014 lived\nin an apartment house, and didn\u2019t see a soul. And there\u2019s certain \u2014 several buildings\nhad been shelled. There were holes in them, big ones, and probably nobody living\nin them. But my \u2014 our building was not damaged, and \u2014 and the buildings across the\nstreet were not damaged. And we pulled our Jeep up, and it \u2014 when places have\nbeen shelled, that \u2014 kind of a funny silence, there\u2019s no birds singing, or things like\nthat, and it was spring \u2014 it was late spring, the beginning of summer, I think. And\n144\nDecember 8, 2011\nwe pulled up, and I showed this guy, my buddy what \u2014 second floor up here, he\nlook up and that\u2019s where our apartment was. I wonder if we can go in there, in the\nbuilding, then \u2014 maybe the front \u2014 the gate was open, and see who lives there, who\ntook over our apartment, and \u2014 and what it looks like. And just about when we\u2019re\ndiscussing this, and no people, this place is empty, a woman comes out of the\nbuilding that we lived in, and she\u2019s carrying a pail. And there\u2019s, across the street\nfrom the building, an \u2014 a lot of cobblestones in Vienna, and \u2014 it\u2019s an old city. And\nshe keeps her head down, because she sees these two soldiers sitting in this open\nJeep, and there have been a lot of rapes before we got there, by the Russians\n[indecipherable]. But she\u2019s an elderly woman. And keeps her head down, but she\nlooks \u2014 turns it and looks at us, and I had my \u2014 I don\u2019t have my hat on. I recognize\nher, who she was. She was a neighbor of ours. And she looks, and all of a sudden,\nshe drops the pail [music \u2014 phone ringing] who is this? That\u2019s my wife, hold on a\nsecond.",
        "A: Yeah, Mickie(ph)? Hello? Yes, I\u2019m still on the ph \u2014 yes, I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re getting\nclose, okay? All right. Yes, so be \u2014 I know, okay, all right. She\u2019s telling me I\u2019m\ntying up the phone. Okay, I know. Anyways, we get this \u2014 wrong part for her to do\nit. Well, we\u2019re going to conclude. So anyways, she looks and recognizes me \u2014 and I\n145\nDecember 8, 2011\nhave curly hair \u2014 and she drops the pail and screams my name. And all of a sudden\n\u2014 and she comes rushing over to me, and starts hugging and kissing me, and \u2014 and\nall of a sudden the street fills up with, I don\u2019t know, hundreds \u2014 hundred \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, lots of people. They all kissing me and hugging me and my God, then where\nis my mom and my dad, and where are the Schtolzenbergs(ph), which is another\nJewish family lived in that building, and they knew they were \u2014 they left for the\nUnited States much before us. And \u2014 oh, and Walter is here. That\u2019s a guy I used to\nplay with when I was very young, his grandmother lived in that same building, he\nused to come and visit. He had just come out of a prison camp. American stalag.\nAnd \u2014 and so he came down, and I didn\u2019t know what to say to him, and vice versa. I\ngave away everything I had, like rations and \u2014 K-rations, or whatever I had, and\nsaid, Pll be back. I never went back. I went back many years later, s \u2014 not \u2014 maybe\n10 years later, and my mother sent me a bunch of money, I should give \u2014 she gave\nme a bunch of names, and I should give out money to some neighbors that were\nvery supportive of us. Which I didn\u2019t know. And I found them, and I start \u2014 I gave\nthem like hundred dollar bills. They really were very sup \u2014 most appreciative with\nus. So I \u2014\n146December 8, 2011",
        "A: Yes, correct. It\u2019s kind of a love-hate, or hate-love, or whatever. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe that\u2019s the wrong term, but it was things that, you know, where were you?\nWhere were they when we needed them? But they couldn\u2019t help themselves. So,\nthey always wanted to know how are my dad, and how is my mom, and what\u2019s\ngoing on, and so \u2014 how did I come, and I\u2019m an American soldier. And they treated\nme like I was, you know, the Prince of Wales, or President Roosevelt, or whoever.\nIt was \u2014 and then I said, I\u2019ll be back, I\u2019ll be \u2014 but I never gone. And I went, did\nsome foolish things. I remember that I used to hang out 1n a place called the\nAugarten \u2014 Ausarten(ph) \u2014 Augarten, which was next to my gymnasium, and\nwhere kids would hang out. And then when the Nazis took over, they put the graffiti\non every bench, no Jews allowed, you know, Juden verboten. Couldn\u2019t sit on a\npark bench. So I went back there, I think I sat on 20 different benches.",
        "A: My God, the people thought I was nuts.",
        "A: Yes, much later.",
        "A: So that\u2019s kind of \u2014 I really wanted to come \u2014 go home, I had enough.\n147December 8, 2011",
        "A: Maybe three to four months.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s \u2014 I think it started like June, May or June, and I came home at\nChristmastime.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t come home \u2014 in other words, I didn\u2019t stay in Vienna all this time. I\nwas \u2014 I f\u2014I went to France, I went to Belgium and France, and I \u2014 staging area,\nand embar \u2014 port of embarkation waiting for a ship, and I landed up in Marseilles. I\nfound my mother\u2019s sister in Brussels. I \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and another sister-in-law of my mother in Brussels, whose husband got\nincarcerated and died in one of the con \u2014 in Dachau \u2014 no ca \u2014 not in Dachau, in\nbuch \u2014 in \u2014 forgotten which camp it was now. And so, it wasn\u2019t until after the war\nthat I \u2014 my mother and I, I went \u2014 I made a few trips to Israel, my mother mi \u2014 I\nthink she got an award from EI AI for all the trips she made to Israel. She had a\nsister lived in Israel. And I was \u2014 I think I made five to six trips to Israel. And I\n148\nDecember 8, 2011\nfound some people there, my [indecipherable] girlfriend. She was 16 and I was 16.\nSo then I finally got home. In Marseilles I had some experience that were\nsomewhat funny. And if you promise not to put it into my biography, I\u2019ll tell you.",
        "A: It was \u2014 I was waiting in Marseilles, and just actually waiting for \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nfor how long, because there was so many people going home, and so few ships. So\nwe had what\u2019s called a s \u2014 they had cigarette camps. They were \u2014 camps were\ncalled Pall Mall, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, all after cigarettes. And they were\nbig camps, were all staging areas, you know. We had several million G.I-s in\nEurope, they had all \u2014 they had \u2014 all had to come home. And one day a few guys\ncame in, and they said they want to go to Marseilles, and I said I have no interest.\nAnd they said well, we want to check out a weapons\u2019 carrier, and a Jeep, then we\ncan\u2019t check it out with you. Without me. So I succumbed to the things, and I didn\u2019t\nrealize that the jees \u2014 well, I knew that the \u2014 three of those guys were made \u2014 had to\n\u2014 made the invasion of Marseilles with the 42\u2122 division, and they knew the town.\nAnd I said, Pll go to go in, but what are you guys \u2014 I\u2019m going to go and find \u2014 if I\nfind some museum, or find a synagogue or something that I \u2014 I was always\ninterested in art, and see what the town looked like, and always remember Charles\nBoyer, about France and Marseilles, and anyways, he was a big movie star at one\n149December 8, 2011\ntime, and so \u2014 French \u2014 so I went, and the first thing, that was in the morning, early,\nthey want to go to the house of prostitution. Well, not me. I said, I\u2019m not going, I'll\ndrop you guys off, and Pll pick you up in an hour, an hour and a half, whatever. So,\nthis 1s nine o\u2019clock in the morning, and they\u2019re knocking on our door, and it\u2019s \u2014 that\ntime, prostitution was legalized in France until we came, the Americans, and made\nit illegal. But \u2014 so this place was one of the legalized places, and they had signs\noutside, off-limits, and out of bounds for the British, that\u2019s what they said. We said\noff-limits, you couldn\u2019t go in, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: The \u2014 the British put down \u2014 we put on off-limits, and the British put down out\nof bounds. That\u2019s what they call it, we call it \u2014",
        "A: Both, both signs, both [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. And neither do \u2014 neither were the \u2014 neither were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 British.\n150December 8, 2011",
        "A: But they\u2019re banging on the door, and I\u2019m sitting in that weapons carrier, and\nwaiting to see what time they want me to come back, there\u2019s \u2014 coming across the\nstreet, they say \u2014 you gotta come. Why? We need 10 people like a million. But 1\u2014\nwhat do you need 10 people? Well, they got a show. And we \u2014 they don\u2019t want to\nput it on unless they have 10 and you\u2019re the number 10. So I go in and they put on a\nporno sh \u2014 girls \u2014 they wake up the girls and they \u2014 they all lived there. It was like\nMarlene Dietrich was in that place, you know, the \u2014 the lampshades had little\nstrings around them, and \u2014 and they had an old Victrola that you had to wind up,\nand they had these couches. And I had a sat \u2014 I had not sat on a couch for two years.\nSo I sat there, you know, the girls come over and they try to entice you, and so it\nwas all a si\u2014 to make a long story short, I decided I behaved myself for two years,\nI\u2019m not gonna go get a venereal disease or get [indecipherable] and how will I\nexplain it to my \u2014 which I hope will be my fianc\u00e9e, and tell the story? Finally, they\nstart drinking, they were selling cognac, and \u2014 and I\u2019m ready to go and one of \u2014 one\nof the guys gets drunk. Big fellow, and \u2014 but that time he sees no evil, and I finally\nconvince him to get out of there. Some girls \u2014 some guys check \u2014 you know,\nshacked up with these girls. Didn\u2019t take very long, and we\u2019re carrying out this one\nguy who had \u2014 so drunk he couldn\u2019t walk. And we went back to camp, okay\u2019? End\n151December 8, 2011\nof story. Not the real end of story. Twenty-five or 30 years later, I\u2019m in \u2014 in \u2014 I live\nin Des Moines, and maybe was longer than that, and this is a group that I have\nnever known \u2014 never heard of Des Moines when I was in Marseilles, I never heard\nof Iowa. I lived in New York City, right? And you know, I came to New York, I\nlived in New York, I went to school in New York, I had hoped to stay in New\nYork, and never heard of Iowa. So I\u2019m in \u2014 back in \u2014 maybe 34 years \u2014 30 years\nlater, maybe more. And I\u2019m in charge \u2014 I think I was president of the federation, or\nsomething, or \u2014 anyways, I\u2019m in charge of the Holocaust Memorial Service. I think\nI was somehow either vice president or president of the federation. And \u2014 Jewish\nfederation. So somebody says to me, I should guy \u2014 call a guy \u2014 oh, no, wait a\nminute. I\u2019m sorry, I got the story wrong. I\u2019m going to a \u2014 a national convention,\nSaint Louis, representing Des Moines, I was president of the federation here, of the\nGA, general \u2014 it\u2019s called the General Assembly of all the Jewish communities that\nmeet once a year, the officers. And this is in Saint Louis. And I had some good\ncustomers in Saint Louis, who \u2014 whose owner \u2014 one of the owners of this\nmanufacturing company was also president of the Jewish Federation of Saint\nLouis, and I was of the Jewish Federation in Des Moines. So we\u2019re business\ncolleagues, and they were my customers and he calls me up and he says, I want you\n[indecipherable] and I\u2019m there, you know, at the convention. We\u2019re having a\n152December 8, 2011\nFriday night Shabbat dinner, and I want you to come, and I want you to meet some\nother people. Okay, there were about 12 people there, one of which was \u2014 this is\nbefore the Holocaust Museum was \u2014 they were just planning it. I think the\ngovernment had just given land to it. And one of the persons there \u2014 there were\nsome well-known Jewish people there at the dinner, and one of the persons there\nwas \u2014 and I can\u2019t remember his name, and he says to me \u2014 we\u2019re talking, and he\nwas in charge of the \u2014 I think this was during Carter\u2019s administration, that the land\nwas given by the government to the Jewish community to build the Holocaust\nMuseum on the mall. And he was, at the time, the person responsible for getting the\nplanning done and everything else. Not the \u2014 okay.",
        "A: He\u2019s a well-known \u2014 and I can\u2019t remember his name, but a well-known person in\nthe Jewish commun \u2014 in Jewish national affairs. And we talking, and having this\nconversation, and he says to me, oh, you\u2019re from Des Moines? He says oh, you\nknow, we have done \u2014 we have a project. This is gonna be part of the museum, that\nwe have con \u2014 trying to contact every G.I. that had something to do with the\nliberation \u2014 not G.I., but every soldier had something to do with the liberation of the\nconcentration camps. And one fellow was one of the first pers \u2014 into Dachau, the\nliberation, and he\u2019s never forgotten it, is from Iowa. And he is \u2014 his story is so\n153December 8, 2011\npowerful, we brought him to Washington to record it.

I\nwas skiing in \u2014 in Innsbruck, in the mountains, and I \u2014 then somehow, I don\u2019t\nknow why, we did go to Vienna for a few days, couple of days, I think, and I ran\ninto a Jewish ski instructor, young man.

But we never knew \u2014 never knew the en \u2014 well, we knew the enormity\nbecause the people all disappeared. I had a grandfather that disap \u2014 that I don\u2019t \u2014\nnever met, I never saw, or a couple of uncles. And I found my mother\u2019s sister, who\nper \u2014 was supposed to \u2014 said she was the housekeeper, but I think she may have\nbeen the mistress of the \u2014 one of the \u2014 the Supreme Court Justices at \u2014 in \u2014 in\nBelgium, who left her this palatial home, right smack on the \u2014 what was it, Rue de\nJustice in Brussels.

And there was a lot of\nblack market going on, big time. You buy s \u2014 carton of cigarettes for 50 cents, and\nyou sold it for t\u2014 for a hundred dollars, or 200 dollars, in all occupation money. I\njust give you an idea of that. So all of this was such an unnatural situation; things\nthat I didn\u2019t want to be involved with. And \u2014 and I had these responsibilities, and I\nwanted out, and I want to go home, I had a girlfriend. I just couldn\u2019t wait to go back\nto the States.

I\nfeel comfortable, I feel secure. I feel part of the community, and it\u2019s \u2014 and when I\ngo to Vienna, I feel the opposite. There is that vulnerability that they somehow\n160December 8, 2011\nwere able to trans \u2014 trans \u2014 transfer to them s \u2014 to me, yeah. I \u2014 I was \u2014 in one of my\nski trips, I left my group, and \u2014 and I was going to go to Dachau. And I went to\nMunich, and I never been in Dachau.

And I went out to get lunch, and I saw these\npeople with the tyr \u2014 Tyrolean, or alpine outfits, and laughing, and sitting by\nthemselves. I felt so terribly vulnerable and insecure and said, what in the world am\nI doing here. And that\u2019s the kind of feeling that I\u2019ve never been able to lose when I\n\u2014 and I\u2019ve been in Vienna, I don\u2019t know, four, five, six times. And I go there, it\u2019s\nlike some people go to \u2014 you know, they go to [indecipherable] they kind of have a\nholiday where they \u2014 they whip each other, they whip themselves.

So I am on a kind of a speaking circuit, and \u2014 and I\nshowed this film, 11 minutes. You could see it, they \u2014 get 1t out of your library. It\u2019s\nHitler\u2019s coming into Vienna and one, two weeks after the \u2014 or three weeks after the\n162December 8, 2011\ntakeover of Germany \u2014 of Austria. And the town in this movie \u2014 it\u2019s done, the\nmovie is silent. It was done by an American professor who were visiting there, who\nhad a little Kodak camera. And he was just \u2014 he had this unbelievable ability to be\nat the right time, to take pictures of Hitler coming to Vienna, and the \u2014 the beez \u2014\nand the enthusiasm with which the Viennese greeted the Nazis. And also there\u2019s a\nlittle episodes in there about his wife trying to go into a Jewish shop, and the SA\nguy wouldn\u2019t let her in, you know, because he said, this is a Jewish merchant, you\nshouldn\u2019t buy here. It\u2019s an 11 minute film.

That was the only kind of communication the G.I.s had, of re\n\u2014 you know, sending home letters, of receiving letters, or sending home packages,\nor may \u2014 sending home money and money orders. So, it was an army post office,\nwhich was very \u2014 part of the adjutant general\u2019s thing.

        "A: Yeah. And they were the first \u2014 I think they left in 1938. They both since have\ndied. I was close with them, I visit them. They came here, they were our guests in\nDes Moines, with their wives. One married a girl from Berlin, and the other one\nmarried a Sabra.
