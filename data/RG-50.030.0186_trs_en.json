        "Q: Would you... Uh, welcome. And would you tell me your name, please?",
        "A: My name is Liane Reif-Lehrer.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: Iwas born in Vienna, Austria, Zweitebitziek, on November 14th, 1934.",
        "Q: Uh, tell me about your parents. Uh, what did your father do?",
        "A: Uh, my father was born in Poland, and came to Vienna to go to medical school. And then uh\nwent on, after he finished medical school, to study dentistry; and then opened a dental\npractice uh in Vienna. Uh, my mother was also born in Poland; and came to Vienna, I think,\nprobably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that.\nAnd somehow met my father. Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in\nVienna. And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's\npractice off the ground. And I think during those early years my mother helped out--\nanswering the phone and...and things like that. But then after that, she really did not work as\nlong as we were still in Europe. And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was\ninside our house. There were two apartments that ...and they had the wall broken down\nbetween them. So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen rooms on one\nlevel. At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our living quarters. Uh,\nso I guess it...it was fairly thriving. And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social\nactivity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know. Maybe some theater.\nAnd uh I think once a week they went to some relatives' and played cards. And uh, you\nknow, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have\nbeen doing.",
        "Q: Uh, what about your...your very uh early years? Uh, you were born in '34. What do you\nremember of your very early childhood?",
        "A: Well, my memories are very spotty. Uh, but uh...[ remember ...J remember my father's\noffice, and I remember my own room and I remember parts of the layout of the apartment\nquite well. Not all of it. I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map. But I uh...I remember\nthe dining room, for example; and I remember the kitchen. Uh, I think I liked messing\naround in the kitchen a lot. And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in\nthere and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that. Uh\n,the cook used to let me stand up on a chair and help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother\nwas not too thrilled about that. Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act...\nWe...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but \"servants,\" in the house. I mean,\npeople who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were\nsort of fun for me. And I remember a fair number of...of things. Like when they uh ...they\nused to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the roof\nmaybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles. And when they rolled up...\nEspecially there were long hallways in the apartment. So we had these long runners, and\nthey would let me stand or sit on one end; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a\nride. Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know,\ngetting swung in the sheets. Uh, and I remember getting rides on brooms. You know, I'd put\nmy feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along. Uh, so I remember that.\n[...1 remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my\nroom, actually. I think in my room there was my uh sort of crib and...and maybe... I only\nremember that there was a crib, although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to\nbelieve that I still slept in a crib. But who knows? And then right in...in uh line with that,\nthere was this other bed where I think the governess slept. Uh, and I remember quite well\nthe layout of my room and where there was a dresser, and I think there was a furry animal,\nand...and where the window was. Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about\nthose early uh years.",
        "Q: What about people? What about your parents? What do you remember about them? What\ndo you remember about...? I believe you had a brother. Tell me about it.",
        "A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the Vienna era about people.\nUh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was\nyounger. But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we\nwere already in the United States long since by that time. But my mother always had a large\npicture of my father on her bed, uh her night table; and I remember a day when I looked at\nthat picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered\nhaving then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph.",
        "Q: OK. Let's get a sense of...of... You described a child having a good time in the house. Uh,\nas the Hitler years progressed and we move toward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh\ncan you tell me what happened?",
        "A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about\nKristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity. Uh, my mother was holding\nme in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt. Uh, and there was this knock at\nthe door. And uh I re...1 mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the\nevening. And uh my mother went to... We had one of these peepholes that has like a metal\ncover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody\nwhammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass. And then the superintendent called\nout, \"Don't worry for life. It's just me; let us in.\" I thought two men came in, but my brother\ntells me actually were five or six. Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant. And uh I\nthink they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually. They kind of rummaged through\nthe house. And I...and I...they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically\nremember them taking is that the cook... There was a white closet in the kitchen where they\nkept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things. And...and there was a uh...a tall\ncan from these things called \"pastilles,\" which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind.\nAnd this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are\nsort of like pennies. And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they\ntook that. And I was not disturbed...[ don't remember being disturbed about them taking\nanything else. But I remember being disturbed about them taking that. And uh...so that\nevening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind. But I...you know, then it blacks\nout on either side of that. Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother-\n-who has often asked me, you know, \"Why do you think backwards instead of living your\nlife forwards?\" Uh, and I...I mean, that's a hard question to answer. But about a year ago,\nwhen he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter. I\nsuddenly realized that I guess... guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that\nera, it's perhaps a little easier. I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what\nhappened and then what happened. And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of\na black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open. And uh\nI guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I\nsuppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person\nor some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to\nremind me of... But I...I can't get it back. And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a\nlot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me,\nand...aand so on. And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that\nrelationship might have been like, but I can't. I can't bring it back.",
        "Q: Alright. You've moved to your father. And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on\neither side of Kristallnacht. You had started...your parents had started looking for papers to\ncome to America, or a way to come to America? What happened?",
        "A: Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father\nwas one of uh quite a few children. And some people say five, some people say seven, some\npeople say nine. I don't know. I have a feeling it was either seven or nine. Uh, and there\nactually was a set of twins in the family. But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to\nAmerica, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's. And there had been some talk in the family,\napparently, of coming to America to join them. Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk\ngot more. Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, \"Look, I'm forty years old.\nI don't know English. Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in America\nwithout extensive re-training. How can I...? And, you know, I have such a good practice\nhere. How can I just get up and go?\" Uh, well, my father never made it to Kristallnacht.\nUh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave. And so, uh on\nthe morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the house in the morning to\ndo a number of chores. And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did.\nUh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they\nwere supposed to meet, I think, either at home or at the home of this cousin where they\nsometimes played cards. But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon. And my\nfather never came back. And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story\nstairwell. And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly\ndepressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer\nallowed to to work. Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide. And so I kind of grew\nup with uh...[ mean, a very strange thing. I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had\ncommitted suicide. Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and\nshe...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that. And I think, really, that\nmust have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up. But anyway, you know,\nI didn't really think about it very much uh either. As an adult now, as I look back and I ask\npeople, \"Well, how...?\" You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things\nthat were being done to people, my question has been: \"How do you know that he jumped?\"\nAnd, well, you know, and they say, \"Well, we don't know that he jumped. But he was very\ndepressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide.\" And uh...and my brother also\nprovides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would\nbe better off without a male. Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this. But I can't help\nalways wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him?\nI mean, nobody would know the difference. So I don't know what the answer to that is.\nBut, anyway, he never came back.",
        "Q: OK. So you and your mother now were left--this is at the end of September 1938--uh\nwithout a father and husband.",
        "A: And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morning were taken on\nKristallnacht. So...",
        "Q: OK. So we move from September to November. Kristallnacht happens. You are without\npassports. What did your mother do? What did you do? All of you?",
        "A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately\ndid. I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which\nwas my father's sister in New York. Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this\nwas, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous van came to the house.\nAnd my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's\ndeath. Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think,\nthe packing of this van. Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what\ncame out of it at the other end. And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous\nassortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects. But anyway, this van was\npacked, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to New York; and\nit was in storage for three years until we finally came there. Uh, so I...I do think I remember\nthe day the van was being packed. But then again, there 1s...",
        "Q: What did you do? The van was packed; and then what did you and your mother do,\nspecifically?",
        "A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this ship that was leaving from\nHamburg, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here. Uh, and because people were\nnot allowed to take money out of the country--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars\nper person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class\ntickets, uh bought first class tickets. Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you\nmight as well, you know, spend it on this. Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got\nthese visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money. Uh, and on...in early May of 1939,\nwe took a train to Hamburg uh to get on this boat. Now, I don't remember anything about\nthe voyage except, I think, I remember two things. One is that there's kind of a sense of fear\nthat I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of checkpoints. And I think that\npart of that must have started at that time. And from what my brother tells me it was very\nscary in Hamburg, because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on? Was\nsomething going to happen before you get on got on? And so on. Uh, and the other thing is\nthat I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the ship;\nand I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white\nsun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. (Laughter) Uh,\nand then I don't remember anything else from from the ship. But uh...I mean, I know that the\nship, of course, came to Cuba and we were not allowed in. Uh, and my brother tells me that\nuh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in Cuba at\nthat the time that the boat docked. And he rode out on a little boat to come and see us. Uh...",
        "Q: Who was the lawyer? Was he a connection with you personally, or with your family?",
        "A: Well, we were quite friendly with them then when we came to the United States. But I think\nwe were friends...I'm not sure that our parents were such good friends. I have a feeling that\nthe friendship might have come about through the friendship between their son and my\nbrother, but I'm not sure about that. But they certainly figured in our lives. I mean, I...I\nremem...they were always talked about. Uh, so he came to the ship, to...to see us,\napparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the ship 1is...1s\nof course well-known, historically. And the ship was turned back, and we went to France.\nAnd that's when I start to have much more coherent memories.",
        "Q: Tell us what happened when the ship docked. What did you do?",
        "A: You mean, when we got back to France?",
        "Q: When you got back to France, yes.",
        "A: Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little town in uh centrally...central France called Loudun.",
        "Q: How did you get there? Do you remember?",
        "A: I don't remember getting to Loudun. But uh in Loudun, we were put up in this hotel. And I\nguess there must have been a group of about twenty of us from the St. Louis. Uh, and I\nremember this hotel, and I remember this...what I thought was a very, very large square in\nfront of the hotel. But in my adult life--when I went back in 1978, I think it was, to Loudun-\n-the square didn't look nearly as large as I remembered it. (Laughter) Uh, uh the things I\nremember from the hotel in Loudun: uh, I remember where our room was--it was a little\nroom on the side. And uh...and I remember some fairly dramatic things. I remember having\nthis little so-called boyfriend that I guess I played with. Uh... What I remember much more\ndramatically are two things. Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember. I\nremember my mother was always very neat and clean. Uh, and I remember that my mother\nwas really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this hotel, and that there were cats running\naround on the food preparation tables. Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely\nhorrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the hotel. There were toilets, but\nno, you know, bathing rooms. And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the\nhotel where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know. And\nmy mother was totally horrified by that. And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did\ntalk about \"You don't know how much perfume this lady wore,\" and so on. So I remember\ntrivia like that, and I remember somehow running around. And I remember uh...I remember\nonce these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a\nchicken that was going to be used for dinner. And...and that was really... remember that\nwith great horror. You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me. Uh, so\nI remember that. But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke\nup and there uh was this incredible commotion outside. And there were uh shots; and, I\nmean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were. And the Germans had\ncome in to Loudun. And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived\nin this hotel, and uh a lot of the German soldiers either... I don't know if they also lived\nthere, but they certainly were around all the time and they had meals there. And one of the\nthings that I remember, to this day, being incredibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I\nwas only about five and a half or so--uh is that I was... First of all, you have to understand I\nwas always a very \"good girl,\" and I always did everything I was told. Uh, and I was told\nthat under no circumstances was I to let on that I spoke German. Now, how they expected to\nperpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French. My brother had had\nFrench lessons in Vienna, so he probably did have some command of French. But I was\nkind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me. And I remember\nvery clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, \"Je ne comprends pas. Je ne\ncomprends pas.\" And I remember also thinking that there was something very funny about, I\nguess, having always been taught that you're not supposed to lie and here I was being\ninstructed to tell this out-and-out lie. And also nobody explained to me why I was telling\nthis lie. And so I was really very perplexed, I think, by this whole thing. But I did exactly\nwhat I was told. And I remember the soldiers saying all these things to me--which I, of\ncourse, understood perfectly--but just saying \"Je ne comprends pas.\" So that was one thing.\nAnother thing... Oh, even before that time, there was one other thing I remember. There\nwas an air raid one night, and I...somehow I...I got away from my mother and I ran outside.\nAnd they had to come and retrieve me. I somehow thought it was interesting, or fun, or\nwhatever. Uh, but anyway, uh...so for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this hotel in\nLoudun, in the morning the Germans would do these...1 don't know. Whatever you call\nthem--you know, maneuvers or something. They'd march around the hotel in formation,\nwith their big boots and things. And uh my mother and my brother and I would watch from\nthe window. And there was one soldier...and I don't remember his face, but I remember, I\nremember his form. And I remember that he had sort of wavy sandy-colored hair. And I...I\ncan't help wondering, in retrospect, maybe he didn't even know I was Jewish. I mean, or\nmaybe he did. I don't know. I always sort of in the past assumed that he knew. But now I\nthink, \"Well, you know, maybe he didn't know.\" Who knows? But he threw me candies uh\non a number of occasions. And my mother was sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them\nanyway. And here Iam. And then, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me a\nlittle doll. And I think that interaction through; I think that interaction very, very strongly\ncolored my life attitudes. Uh, because I think...I think even then, you know, I somehow must\nhave known that these were the bad guys. But this guy, who I have a feeling might have\nbeen you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was just nice, you know; and he was nice to me.\nUh, and...and maybe I jump to conclusions on very naive grounds; but several years later,\nwhen I came to the United States, and kids would and...and their parents ask me, you know,\nreally ridiculous things to say to a child--like, uh, \"How do you like America?\" And, \"Do\nyou hate the Germans?\" And I remember always saying, \"No, I don't hate the Germans.\nThere are good Germans, and there are bad Germans.\" And I ...1 mean maybe this is\nsimplistic, but I've always thought that it really had to do with this one soldier that somehow\nmade me get a...a very sensible attitude, even though I was so young, about the differences\nbetween people. And I've always sort of very fondly remembered that.",
        "Q: OK. So you were in Loudun, uh and you had these these memories. Uh, how long were you\nin Loudun?",
        "A: Uh, we must have been in Loudun for somewhere between nine months and a year.",
        "Q: What is your perception of your mother during that period?",
        "A: I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I had realized this more when she was still around--\nmy mother must have really, basically, been an incredibly strong person to have gone\nthrough that. Because when I try to think back on it, I often think I...you know, I don't think\nI could have done the things that she did.",
        "Q: That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking what your memory of her...",
        "A: [...1 know what you're asking, and I...I really had to give that preamble; because my...my\nsense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow\nnever got it all together except for the practical things. That she somehow was so...I'm not\nsure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic. I mean, she was... And who knows? I\nmean, maybe I would have been the same way. But I mean, she really...she was in mourning\nfor my father for the rest of her life. And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84. I\nguess she was a woman who already had learned something like five languages, but she\ncould not learn French. You know, it was not just there at that time. Uh, and I think uh... I\nwish I could remember the German word that that she used to use a lot. That she was just\nuh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know what to do, you know, with herself or what was\ngoing on, and so on. Uh, and I think the... What she had always told me was that after the\nGermans came into Loudun, that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess,\nuh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in Loudun, and that whether\nshe left or not he was leaving. Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those\nterms. What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some\nrefugees in the hotel, and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there. Uh,\nand there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who\ndecided not to go. And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the\npicture of before. And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947. But\nanyway, so I don't remember that. What I do remember is that one night we left everything\nthat we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and\nstuff. We left everything, and we left in the dark of night. And I think I have a...my\nrecollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin. And this\ngroup of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a train that went\nto the south of France. Uh, and then uh so I remem.... I remember walking to the train\nstation in Loudun, but I don't remember anything of this trip. But what my brother tells me\nis that uh when we got to the border--which I guess was Poitiers--and we had to go through\nthis uh...you know, whatever you do at borders, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940,\nthe lower echelon people in these offices were still French people rather than Germans. And\napparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this office, and said,\n\"Look, you know, I've really got to get across the border, because I'm here and my husband\nis already on the other side.\" And so this woman said, \"Yeah, alright.\" You know, and\nstamped her whatever you needed to get stamped. And then she turned and said, \"You\nknow, that's also the situation for all these other people. They also have somebody else\nwaiting on the other side.\" And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said,\n\"Yeah, yeah. OK.\" And so we all got across. And we went to somehow uh to Limoges, and\nnow that's where my memory picks up again. Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in\nthe railroad station; and I...I remember, I think I slept on a...on a scale. You know, the kind\nof thing you weigh the baggage on. Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just\none night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an\nabandoned uh circus arena that was...I guess it was stone. And uh...and I remember waking\nup the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just\nsleeping on this...on this stone. Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for\nsix weeks and that people graduated. You know, gradually people found places to live, and\nso you kind of got to move to the better seats. And then, apparently, the...the most desirable\nplace was around the periphery of the arena. There were these uh...what I call orange crate\nmake-shift beds that had straw mattresses in them. And so that was... for the last few days\nwe were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those. And then, uh somehow there was a...\nthis Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees. And they found uh a\nuh place that I think had been a pool hall, and there was a small room that must have been...\nI mean, it was really not a very big room. It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty\nfeet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet. Certainly not...not any bigger than that. Uh,\nand there were about thirty women who slept in that room. And then, right above that, there\nwas another room where all the...the men slept. And I don't remember there being any other\nfemale children except for me. And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection\nof anything but adults. And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he\nmight have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well. But then, I mean, this is\nwhere I really start to remember. I mean, I remember this place well. And actually, I went\nback there in 1963 to visit it. And uh so we slept in this room; and at night we had these\nstraw mattresses, and we'd line them up. It was body to body on the floor. Uh, and then in\nthe morning, they would get piled up against the side of the room. And there were all these\nsort of orange crates, you know, really wooden kind of crates that got pulled out. And we sat\non those and...and ate off them and...and so on. And uh so we were in this room for...I don't\nknow, quite a long time. And I began going to school. My first year of schooling was in\nLimoges; and I remember walking to the school, and I remember the classroom. And I still\nhave my three notebooks from that year. And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember\nas a quite not very pleasant woman. And uh she seemed very old to me them. I mean, she\nhad sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she\nsat up on a dias. And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things\nthat stand out in my mind. Uh one is that every morning she would come down every aisle\nof seats with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I\nguess. And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually\nspreading this. And so sure enough, one day I came home and one of the women spotted\nthat I had lice. And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every\nday who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it\nmercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head\nout. So that was kind of horrible. The other thing that I remember is I was ...I was very\nanxious to be very good in school, and I did very well at almost everything except\npenmanship. I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever;\nand I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French 1's and s's you're\nsupposed to have this little bump, you know at the top. And I could never quite get that\nright. I mean, she did...she accepted all the others. I've never had a good penmanship, but\nshe accepted everything else. But she was constantly after me about that little, you know,\nsquiggle that I couldn't get right. So I remember that. The other thing that I remember is\nthat everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get. And so uh I...my\nbrother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh\nsomething that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle. And my mother\ninsisted that we share that. And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this\nmilk. Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that\nI really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I\ngot sent into bakeries to beg for bread. And the line was, \"I've got uh...I have... have\nmoney, and I have ration coupons. But uh...\" Or maybe we didn't have ration coupons,\nwhatever it was, you know. \"...we really need bread.\" And so that was my role. And I\nwould...that bread was not only for us, but 1t would be shared with some of the other people.\nAnd when I was interviewing my brother last year--because I wrote an article about this--\n[...I said to my brother, \"Did it ever occur to anybody how incredibly demeaning it must\nhave been to a little girl to have to go in and beg for bread?\" And my brother, who is a very\npractical person, looked me straight in the eye and said, \"It wasn't demeaning. It was bread.\"\nAnd uh...but somehow I can't feel that way about it. And uh...and I guess... mean, I guess\nwe shared duties in that he had to...all the...you know, he filled out all the forms, and when\nthings had to be packed or when you had to go to an office to ask about visas, I mean, he got\nto do all that. And, of course, I was too young to do that. But uh but I got this horrible chore\nto do, because I was younger and cuter I guess. Uh, so I remember that. Uh, and then I\nremember very clearly, two times uh...I think you were allowed a pound of potatoes per\nmonth per person and one egg per month per person, according to these ration coupons. And\nso, one time my mother heard that there were eggs out in this farm, which was...I mean, I\nremember just walking what seemed like miles and miles and miles. And we came home\nwith these eggs, and my mother opened them and they were all rotten. And then another\ntime, we heard that there were potatoes. And again, I mean, you know, it seemed as though\nwe walked for just ages and we came home with these three pounds of potatoes. And I guess\nwe were just... this is like such a feast that uh my mother just cooked the three pounds of\npotatoes. And I think we just ate them all up. Uh, and then there was a...probably the most\nwonderful birthday of my life happened in this period. I don't know how my mother pulled\nthis off; but on my birthday, uh she came with a little brown paper bag. And 1n this paper\nbag was--I don't remember, I think it might have been like a peach, or...and one other big\nfruit and some dried fruits. And it was probably the nicest present I've ever gotten. So, uh so\nI remember that. And...and the two other dramatic things that I remember from that era is\none that my brother somehow had a Bar Mitzvah in the midst of this. And I don't remember\nmuch about the Bar Mitzvah, except that he was given a...a silk...a beautiful blue silk string\nbag--which we had for years--and it was filled with uh, I don't know, just a lot of different\ngoodies that were kind of nice. Uh so that was one thing I remember. And the other thing--\nand we still have one of these, and it's in my son's car, as a matter of fact. And I just said to\nmy son the other day, \"Don't you ever lose this!\" Uh, somewhere, after...[ don't know\nwhether it was weeks or months, uh two things happened. First of all--and I can't remember\nwhich happened first--but one day these two guys walked down. It was sort of a mild hill,\nthe street we were on; and these two guys came down the hill, and each of them was holding\none end of a bolt of grey blanket cloth. And it...[ mean, I still have it. So I can tell you with\nwith great accuracy that this is the...the worst quality fabric I have ever felt in my life. IL..I\ndon't think it had an 1ota of warmth in it. But uh it was such a...I remember that nice feeling\nof these guys coming with this blanket cloth, and they just had like a knife or something.\nAnd they just stood there and kind of, you know, pulled off...I don't know, maybe a yard and\na half. Uh, and everybody kind of got a square of this, and...and we got two squares. Uh and\nthat was, you know, that was like manna from heaven. Uh, and as I say, that grey blanket is\nin...in ... One of them got lost somewhere; but the other one is in my son's car. Uh, and then\nI guess somewhere along those uh months, the little house right next door to where we were\nstaying became free. And I don't know why we had the good fortune, but the little place next\ndoor was a one...I think it was just a one story place, and it had two rooms. And there was a\nsmaller inner room, and then this larger outer room. And my brother and mother and I were\ngiven that little inner room. And the outer room was kind of divided in half. And the back\npart of it was given to these two sisters who were married to two brothers. And one of the\nbrothers was named [Lutz (ph)]. I don't remember his last name. And he was almost blind.\nHe had very bad vision, and he spent a lot of his time cutting out those kind of leather belt\nloops that, you know, you hook one into the other and make belts. And I...1 remember we\nused to help him do that sometimes. And he did that in the outer part of this room, which\nwas like his workspace. Uh, so those are, those are some of my... Oh, there was one other\nnice thing that I remember from Limoges. There was a...a carpenter that we somehow got to\nknow. Uh, and I think he was kind of a very mellow-looking guy, with maybe reddish kind\nof hair and beard. And you know, he seemed old to me then; but in retrospect he probably\nwas thirty-five or something. Uh but he made a wonderful little set of toy furniture for me\nout of wood, and then he...he glued little pieces of wallpaper on the chairs, you know, to\nmake it look as though they were upholstered. And uh I certainly had those for years and\nyears after that, and always treasured them greatly. Uh, so I guess those are uh... Oh. One\nthing that I didn't mention, uh and this was from Loudun. We went from Loudun to Paris, to\ntry to get visas; and that must have been like late in August of 1939. Uh, and I remember\nthere was an air raid. My mother and my brother and I were in a hotel. There was an air\nraid, and for some reason we didn't hear it and we didn't wake up. Somebody came and\nbanged on our door and woke us up, and we all rushed to this air raid [shelter] in the middle\nof this huge boulevard. And what I remember is that the smell of dog doo in that air raid\nshelter was just overwhelming; and I remember that sort of scary feeling of being down there\nand the sirens and the commotion. And then...and then we were told to go back to Loudun,\nand that we would get visas in, you know, whatever it was--six weeks or something. But\nthen, of course, the war officially started. The Germans came in, and uh...and...and we never\ngot back there. But...but that I do remember--being in Paris in the air raid shelter. So then\nuh... Well, I remember a lot about school. I mean, I remember doing design in school. I\nguess that was one of my favorite subjects. It was uh...1t was...1t was a very controlled kind\nof art class. Design, it was...it was not the kind of thing that kids do now. And you know,\nyou colored in and out the little squares and things.",
        "Q: Did you have any friends?",
        "A: You know, that's a very interesting question. I don't remember having any friends in\nLimoges. I must have known some of the kids in my class. My brother, I think, had a very\nnice sort of older boy, who was a pianist, who took him under his wing and I think did a lot\nfor him. But I don't remember...I don't remember any friends. And I...I think 1t was a very\nlonesome time for me. Uh, but I, you know, somehow I...I played, and I played with the\nlittle doll furniture; and I uh...I think I spent a lot of time in school, and I think my mother\nplayed with me. And I... do remember one thing, actually. And I think this was in\nLimoges, but I'm not sure. Uh, and I think this has also stayed with me for life. I remember\nmy brother was playing with a group of kids his age, and they were running. Maybe they\nwere playing hide-and-seek, or something. And I was trying to keep up with them. And I\nfell, and I remember having these enormous scabs on...on both knees for a long time. And\nI...I...I know I've always had a fear of falling. And when our kids were small, I...I ust found\nit intolerable to see them run. And so I would always let my husband take care of that, you\nknow; and I would sort of turn the other way. Because I didn't want to inhibit them. But uh\n[...1 remember that day, I remember those bloody horrible knees. And...and you know, and\nuh...but I don't remember having any little friends of my own.",
        "Q: Why... When did you leave Limoges, and why?",
        "A: Uh, we had been in touch with my father's sister and her children, and they were trying very\nhard to get us visas. And apparently we would get a visa; the visas, I guess, expired in fairly\nshort periods. And so we would... apparently, we would get a visa and there would be no\nship, or we couldn't get to the ship. And then there would be a ship, but no visa. And...but\napparently somehow things came together, and we left and went to Marseilles. And again, I\nthought that was just for a couple of days; but my brother tells me we were there for several\nweeks. Uh, and I don't remember Marseilles at all. But apparently my brother did a lot of uh\nleg work there, and it was a matter of just standing in line after line after line. And then,\nfinally, everything worked out. You know, we had to get an entry visa for Spain, and an\nentry visa for Portugal, and an exit visa for France; and it had to be done in the right order,\nbecause, you know, one couldn't be had without the other one first. And apparently there\nwas an incredible amount of... of red tape and bureaucracy and waiting lines, and there was\nno food; and it was just a mess. And I don't remember any of that. The only thing I\nremember quite clearly is getting on a train one night and going through Spain. Now I don't\nremember... didn't remember, until my brother told me, that we stopped I guess twice in\ncities in Spain. But I remember sitting in this train, which was...I mean, it was like New\nYork during rush hour. Uh, and I remember that it was like this sort of totally chaotic scene.\nI mean, there were women in babushkas with big baskets; and I think there was one woman\nwho had a chicken in her basket, you know, tied up with a scarf. And uh this sort of\npandemonium scene, and being on this train. And then I don't remember anything else until\nwe got on the ship going to the U.S. Uh, but my brother uh has a lovely story about going\nthrough the uh border check, uh at the Portuguese border. And he said... you know, I mean,\nthere was no food on the train. It was a mess. It was dirty and everything. And then\neverybody had to get off to go through customs; and my brother said, \"When we got back on\nthe train, it was like a different world. You could smell fresh rolls, and it was all clean.\"\nAnd uh so he...he just, you know... I mean, when he tells that, he just breaks out into this\nwonderful smile. Uh, and I don't remember being in Lisbon. Apparently, we walked around\nthere for two weeks, waiting for this ship--which was called the S.S. Exeter--to sail.",
        "Q: Let's hold it there for a minute.",
        "A: We skipped the St. Louis, huh? (Laughter)",
        "Q: We'll change tapes.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Let's pick up now. You are on the train, and you have arrived in Portugal. Uh, what\nhappens when you get off the train? Where did you go? What do you remember?",
        "A: I don't remember anything until we got on the ship. And then I only remember something\nwhich is not very pleasant; and that is, that I guess on the ship uh there was, you know,\nsuddenly food. I mean, real meals, and...you know, and a dining room which looked nice,\nand so on. But all three of us were seasick, essentially, the whole way across the Atlantic.\nAnd so uh I don't think we were able to, after finally getting to some nice food, uh to really\navail ourselves of it. Uh, and I guess that's about all I remember about that trip, uh until we\narrived in the U.S. And one of my earliest recollections, there was something that was very\nuh...1t caused a lot of apprehension in me; because uh I had never seen an oral thermometer,\nbecause in Europe we use these underarm, you know, mammoth-sized thermometers. And\nthese people, I think, in white uniforms came around; and I remember sitting in this big room\nin these chairs, and somebody came around and stuck an oral thermometer in everybody's\nmouth. Uh, so I think I was apprehensive, not only because I was little and I...you know, this\nseemed like really weird. Uh, but as an adult, as I look back, I have a feeling that I also was\nvery aware that this was still another check point and that you could still be turned away.\nAnd I don't know whether somebody had told me that, you know, if you weren't healthy you\ncouldn't come in. I mean, maybe my mother had been talking about that or something. But I\nremember that arrival time as being a time of...of apprehension. And then I remember being\npicked up by the relatives. Uh, and what I...what I remember most dramatically... Well, first\nof all, there was this...I think 1t was a big fancy black car. I mean, not fancy by American\nterms; but to a small kid who, you know, just had not seen anything like this for a long time.\nUh, and I was sitting in the back seat with my mother and my brother. And my mother was\nnext to me, and she was at the window seat; and my aunt lived in uh...in the lower part of\nManhattan, which was not a very nice place--uh, Avenue D. And uh as we drove into that\nneighborhood, my mother...I mean, I could hear her. I could hear her very audibly. My\nmother whispered in German, under her breath, something like, \"Have I suffered so long,\nand come all this way, for this?\" And I think that that was...I mean, that struck me as being...\nI mean, in retrospect... As I think back on it, I don't know what I thought at the time. But in\nretrospect, 1t seems like such an ungrateful statement to make at that moment. Because, you\nknow, I mean, suddenly we were free. And uh...but I think she was so appalled. And I\ndon't...you know, I'm not sure why she was so appalled, because it surely must have been\nbetter than, you know, what had been in France, and so on. But uh...but anyway, that's ...I\nremember her saying that. And uh so then uh we went and lived in my Aunt Lena, who was\nLena Klinghoffer. Uh she had what was really quite a small apartment, and she had five\nchildren. And they were grown; but three of them were still living in this apartment. Uh,\nand Leon and [Albe (ph)], the two boys, were living at home; and the youngest daughter,\nDorothy. Uh, and somehow she made the kids double up. And...and so my brother and my\nmother and I got one tiny bedroom, and we actually lived there with her for about three\nmonths. And uh I guess my mother went out apartment hunting and job hunting, and so on.\nUh, and I mean, I remember a lot of anecdotal things happened in my Aunt Lena's house.\nLike uh uh...I mean, everybody sort of assumed that, because we had been starving for the\nlast two years, that we would eat anything that was put in front of us. Well, that was not true\nat all. My brother and I were the world's fussiest, pickiest eaters. And you know, and this\nfood that was put in front of us was...I mean, it was very alien kind of...of food. Uh, and so\nwe...we...and probably our stomachs were so shrunken anyway that we didn't need very\nmuch. And so we...we were very...you know, we didn't eat a lot of things that were put in\nfront of us. And I think my aunt thought that was very peculiar. And uh uh...and then I...]\nremember, uh you know, my mother had always been very proud of the fact that she never\nlearned to cook, and that she...you know, that other people had done things for her. And uh,\nof course, she very quickly, when we got out apartment, learned how to cook a certain\nnumber of things. But uh she would always say, \"I don't even know how to boil water.\"\nAnd then one time my Aunt Lena got sick, and the kids were out. And...and I think my\nmother really...1 don't know, she was supposed to make some porridge or something. And\nshe really...she sort of couldn't do it, you know. Hard to believe. And I don't know; I\nsometimes get the feeling that it was like almost, you know, could she really not do this? I\nmean, how do you get to grow up and not know how to do this? Or was it all a put-up job?\nWell, I don't know. Uh, turned out that my mother was a very talented lady. And uh...and\nuh very quickly learned how to do all the things that...that were needed. And I think the\nreally sad thing is that uh there was nobody around to really guide her about what she should\ndo. And you know, and...and my Aunt Lena was not a wealthy woman. And uh so I think it\nwas...1t was necessary to uh... to sort of quickly get something going. And so my mother did\nuh the easiest thing, and the first thing that came her way. And she spent the whole rest of\nher life working as a sewing machine operator in a factory. Which was kind of very heavy\nwork, uh but I think... And she's a very hard worker, but... And I think it was not so much\nthe hard work that bothered her; but I think she was...she was very, very bothered by the\nkinds of people that she met in the factory, and she felt totally alien from those people. You\nknow, they uh... I mean, she was...she made acquaintances very easily, but she didn't make\nfriends very easily. Uh, and I think the people that she tended to make real friendships with,\ninsofar as she did, were always, you know, other people her age from Vienna, or other places\nlike that, who sort of...you know, where they could talk about what had been, or whatever it\nwas. Uh, and she just found the conditions in the factory appalling. Uh, I mean she was so\n...first of all, she was so European and so formal. And I mean, it...it drove her crazy that\npeople called her by her first name. I mean, nobody every would have done that. You\nknow, she was \"Frau Dr. Reif,\" and not, you know... And all of a sudden, she's \"Klara.\" Uh,\nshe would come home, and sometimes... I think one time she even cried, because she\nwalked into an office and some guy was sitting at the desk with his feet up; and he didn't take\nhis feet off the desk when she walked in. Well, you know, you didn't treat ladies that way.\nAnd uh uh...and then, I mean, the whole new thing to her was the kind of language that\npeople used in the factory. I mean, she had never heard anything like this before. And so\nshe...you know, and...and gradually she learned to cope with it, and she kind of... You know,\nshe would kid around with people at work; but I don't think she ever, you know, really felt\nhappy in that situation. And as I say, it wasn't just the hard work, but it was really more that\nshe just felt this was not her milieu. Uh so she was a very... mean, she was a very...basically\na lonesome, unhappy woman in many ways in her life. But, on the other hand, on the\nsurface she was not. I mean, she...you know, she always kept herself busy and very involved\nin this and that and the other thing. And she learned English, I think, relatively quickly. Uh,\nand uh she...you know, kept herself active and always knew where all the free concerts and\nfree plays were, and took advantage of all those cultural things, and ran around to the\nmuseums. And uh uh...and so she did all those things. And I...actually, I should say that\nreally was much later; because in the early days, life uh... in the early years, life was very\nvery difficult. So after three months, when we left my Aunt Lena's house and got an\napartment in Brooklyn, uh I think at her first job she was earning $15 a week. And I think\nthe rent was $45 a month in this apartment, or maybe $35 a month. So for...for a long time\nshe hardly ate. I mean, you know, all her money went to paying the rent and feeding us.\nAnd uh...1 mean, she was the usual, you know, Jewish mother. I mean, we came first\nalways, everything, you know. Uh, and she gradually...you know, she...I...she never... I\nmean, she would have been a fantastic bookkeeper, and she would have been so much\nhappier, you know, if somebody had led her into that when she...once she mastered the\nlanguage. But they didn't. So she spent the rest of the time in the factories. And uh she...uh\nshe really...she did not... I don't know what to call it. I mean, for example, my brother and I\nnever worked. You know, and in retrospect that's really weird. Nobody ever asked us to\ncontribute to the family income. Uh, our job was to study; and everything, you know, kind\nof rotated around that. Uh, so that...and in some sense, I mean, you could say that I was a\nspoiled brat once I came here. Because when I wanted to do my homework, I told my\nmother she couldn't wash the dishes until after I finished. Because the noise of the water\nrunning bothered me. So here's this lady who's been working in the factory and then, you\nknow, travelling and...and coming home. And I mean, I did help around the house a little bit.\nUh, but I mean, she basically made dinner and she washed the dishes. I think I sometimes\ndried them. And uh so she did all this work, and then she...she did this incredible\nbookkeeping thing every night. She would not go to sleep until the amount of money in her\nchange purse matched with this little...she had a little book she carried with her. And\nevery...even if it was only two cents, it got written down; uh and it had to match to the\npenny. And she would go over it, and over it and over it again. You know, \"Where did I\nspend that extra ...?\" Whatever, even if it was only three cents, until that matched everyday.\nAnd it got to be funny, because in...1in later years once I remember having a little argument\nwith her about how much a certain dress that I had cost. And she just went right back and\npulled out her book. \"No, that was...you know, it was $13.95!\" (Laughter)",
        "Q: What about uh you, during these years?",
        "A: Well, uh I think I was kind of a...1n some sense, a dual personality kid. I mean, I was...I liked\nto play, and I was kind of, you know, fun-loving and...on one side. Uh, but there was this\nother side of me that was serious and thoughtful, and I guess introspective and a lot of other\nthings. And...and lonesome. Uh, not the kind of lonesome that... I wrote a poem about this,\nactually. More thinking about my mother; but not the kind of lonesome that goes away\nwhen other people are around, but just a kind of inherent feeling of...1 don't know. Uh, I\nmean, only now in recent years I very often think that the only way I can explain it is, you\nknow, maybe it's what happens to a kid... I mean, what happens when a four year-old kid 1s\ntold that she's never going to see her father again. Especially, you know, having been told\nthat...that he was incredibly affectionate to me. I mean, what does that do? What does that\nmean? Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basically...I...you know, I love to dance and I like to\nsing. I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes. And my brother and I love to tell jokes. Uh\nuh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of my brother, which is much more evident I\nthink in him than in me. But there's a very morbid part of me also. I mean, it's a...I don't,\nyou know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but 1t never goes away. So uh...and then I think, I\nmean, my mother certainly tried very hard. But I think she did and said some things that\nwere not really very good for kids growing up. She always told us that we were different. I\ndon't think that was very good for us. Uh, we were supposed to be \"aristocratic\"--you know,\nin quotes. I mean, that was a myth. I don't...we were not aristocratic in Europe, either. I\nmean, we were just reasonable, middle-classed people. Uh, but uh so I always felt different.\nI felt different, anyway. I mean, you know, I come, here I am at age seven learning my third\nlanguage, and sort of--if you consider the whole Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age\nseven. And I remember coming to school in the U.S.; and you know, all the little girls and\nboys around me are, you know, obviously talking about me. And I can't understand what\nthey're saying. Well, I learned English really fast, let me tell you. Uh, but I always felt\ndifferent. Well, you know, the more different you feel, somehow you stay different and you\nbecome different. And uh uh...and to this day, I still...1 mean, no matter...1 mean, I always\nfeel different. And I think I never thought of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning\nphysicist that they interviewed in the [Boston] Globe; and he said, \"I always felt a little\ndifferent, and it always hurt a little.\" And when I read that, I thought, \"That's...that's\nreally...that describes me.\" Because I think subconsciously, somehow I've always wanted to\nbelong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatever, you know, groups of things. Not ever\nto belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things and I don't want to belong. I don't uh...I don't\nlike being associated with divisive things. I mean, I have very mixed feelings about, you\nknow, even about belonging to the...the quality of being Jewish, or whatever you want to call\nit. Uh, because I think that's very divisive. I mean, I...you know, all the divisive things that\nhave happened in history have happened because people are...you know, belong to...to some\nof these things. So that's not the kind of belonging that I want. But the...belonging to...to,\nfor example, uh... Oh, you know. Within an academic environment, uh people who have\nsimilar interests or people who like to do some activity or something. And I always...I mean,\nI'm 55 years old but I still always feel that there 1s something different about me compared to\nall these other people. And it always...in some strange way, there's a difference. Uh, and\nthen, of course, when I was little, the difference became greatly exacerbated because there\nwas such an an emphasis put on learning and studying and so on. And that was not the\nfavorite activity of most of the other kids at 1092 President Street. And so the other kids\nwould come home and uh go out and, you know, play--this, that and the other thing. And I\nwould very often...I mean, I did play outside in the street, too. But I did a Hell of a lot of\nhomework. And in retrospect, I think I did a lot more homework than was ever assigned.\nUh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids were different. They were not interested.\nAnd I, at some very early age, decided I was going to be a scientist and I was going to do\nthis and that and the other thing. And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations. And uh\nI suppose part of that was enhanced, in that, you know, I mean my mother just kind of\nexpected that we would do things and she knew that they were not going to do things. And\nuh...and I think she did not let that pass quietly by. Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I\nplayed and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not allowed to do anything dangerous. And that\nincluded uh... My mother used to have a fit. I mean, in those days people thought that if you\nwalked up and down the stairs--and we lived on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a\nheart attack. So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time\nI had to walk up and down the stairs. Uh, I was not allowed to uh ride a bicycle, uh when the\nother kids were learning to ride bicycles; and I think...I think partly that was a financial\nmatter. You know, I mean, it took a quarter an hour to rent a bicycle. Uh, but I think mostly\nit was a safety matter. But one of the things that happened very early on is that uh...I mean, I\nhad this brother who was almost eight years older, who was a very...we were very close; and\nI had my mother, who was a very worrisome Jewish mother. And I think very early on,\nthere were many times when my mother would say \"Black,\" and my brother would say,\n\"White.\" And at a very early age, I think I discerned that my brother's responses came from\nthe head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut. And that, obviously, from\nthe head was better. And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to make a\ndecision between the two opinions, I almost invariably did what my brother said. Uh, and he\nwas very protective of me; and we had a very sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in\nretrospect. But it was a very uh uh loving, and very uh you know sort of...we were always,\nyou know, sort of kissing and that kind of thing. And, by and large, people did not yell,\nand...and so on. But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the kitchen,\nbecause I...he had his own room but I studied in the kitchen, uh he would be right there.\n\"What are you saying to this child?\" And uh I remember funny things, like uh if I had a cold\nuh my mother would say, \"Well, maybe you should stay home from school and stay in bed.\"\nAnd my brother said, \"You take two handkerchiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're\nusing the other one. And go to school.\" Well, I mean, I went to school with the two\nhandkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess, I probably spent or tried to spend and\nprobably did spend a certain amount of time with my brother's friends, who were much older\nthan me. I mean, they were adults and I was still a kid. And I think they were trying to get\nrid of me a certain amount of the time. I mean, they did...my brother took me to my first\nmuseum. And one of his friends took me to my first ballet, and so on. Uh, and I remember\nonce my mother getting involved, because my brother didn't want to take me someplace he\nwas going with a friend. And my mother - I remember this 1s so ridiculous - my mother said,\n\"You can't go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't.\"\n(Laughter) Uh, so it was not a typical childhood, in that sense.",
        "Q: OK. Thank you very much. You seem to have pulled a lot of it together. I think before we\nbreak, though, what I'd like to ask you... First of all, 1s there anything that you want to add\nthat you haven't already covered?",
        "A: Well, uh, yeah. I think maybe I'd like to mention that I talk about this very easily now, but\nthat all the times when my mother was still alive and that she wanted to talk about some of\nthese things, I really didn't want to hear about it. I didn't want to listen. Uh, first of all,\nbecause she would get very emotional, and I... And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate\nthat. Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my\nkids responding in the same way. I mean, that [they] don't really need this. Uh, and so I\nreally went through very many years, essentially, not thinking very much about this and\nmaking believe it never happened. And when the other kids or other people would ask me,\n\"Well, what effect do you think your background had on you?\" I would say, \"Well, I was\ntoo young and I don't remember anything, and I don't think it had any effect on me.\" And I\nthink uh--and I've been trying to write about some of these issues--I think that there's a\ncertain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and\nyou're sort of building your life and it's very easy to sort of not look back and push\neverything aside. And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think\nfor other people also, somehow the back...background comes back to haunt you. And it\nwasn't really until after our kids were born, and...and uh you know maybe when I was about\n35, that I started noticing that I...that certain things I did were not really logically explainable\nby...by things that were happening then. And that the only logical explanation of why I was\ndoing certain things in that way, or doing them at all, had to do probably with some of the\nthings that had happened very early in life in Vienna. And you know, my father\ndisappearing and uh...and things that happened tn... in France and uh...and in that school in\nLimoges, and uh... and that whole business of sort always being on the run for those years,\nand being scared, and uh... And I think there is a lot of interesting material uh to explore\nthere. Uh, and uh...and to explore with other people who have had similar experiences. Uh,\nI think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, I mean, I would always like to have a\ncontrolled experiment, and of course there is no controlled experiment--but trying to pick\napart. Uh, and of course it's only conjectural, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but\nsomehow trying to define for myself, you know, what things that have stayed with me are\nreally due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in\nFrance, and so on. And what things are just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents\nby and large are crazy anyway. Right? And...and so you, your parents uh somehow inflict\non you uh some of that craziness that they have. Uh, and it's hard to tell, because of course I\ndon't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started. And it's only in\nrecent years, and actually since she's died, that I've really thought enough about this to to\nrealize that, you know, she might have been and probably was a very sort of, you know,\nhappy carefree person in many ways uh but I never knew her. I mean, my mother wore\nblack for years and years and years; and then she finally switched to navy. And it was, you\nknow, it was only very very late, when I was already essentially an adult that she would ever\nwear anything that was red, or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she\nkept up on [my] father's grave. She always you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle. Uh uh she\nshe always uh...you know, I mean, she always I think in...1n many ways--in her thoughts, at\nleast--she always lived in her past. Not...not in her actions, but you know... \"If I only had\nmy sister to talk to,\" and so on. And then one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh\nbecause I...1 do remember this and it was very dramatic was right after the war was over.\nThere was a blue letter that arrived from...I think it was from a cousin of my mother's who\nended up in Israel--and I don't know if he's still alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had\nhappened to many of our relatives. And I mean, that, you know, I remember it as being\nhorrendous; but now, when I think back, that must have been just such an incredible\nnightmare to my mother. Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean,\nessentially everybody was killed, and...and some of them in rather grotesque ways. Uh and\n[...1 guess I wish I could have been a little bit more understanding of me in relation to my\nbackground, and I think that would have lead to...to my having a better understanding and\nappreciation of my mother uh during those years. Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got\nalong very well uh until the other girls started dating. And then she got... END OF TAPE\n...like our live-in baby sitters. And I had my very strong, very very democratic ideas about\nuh...you know, the way those people should be done, should be treated. And I...and I think\nin some sense there was kind of...I guess, she verbalized it often. She felt that we treated our\nlive-in baby sitters better than we treated her. And that was probably true, because they\ndidn't sort of interfere in our lives. And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when\nshe should have become a friend. And I think...I mean, in retrospect now that was because\nshe was very lonesome. So there's a lot more, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it\nsometime.",
        "Q: OK. I hope you do. Uh, thank you.",
        "A: Is there anything else you wanted to...?",
        "Q: As a postscript, yeah. We'll get to photos in a minute, but because you lived in the\nKlinghoffers...lived with the Klinghoffers for a while and there has been a great interest\nlately in Leon Klinghoffer, after the Achille Lauro incident, do you remember Leon? Can\nyou describe him as a child?",
        "A: Uh, I remember...I remember all five children uh very well. Uh, I guess I sort of uh really\nliked at first the youngest daughter best, because she was so pretty and dynamic and she\ndressed so nicely. And I was a little girl, and uh...and I guess, I didn't take very much\ninterest in the two boys. I think partly because they were involved in, you know, they ran\nthis hardware store and they were busy; but I think also they seemed a little gruff to me. Uh,\nthe girls, all - actually it's funny - the girls were all very well-spoken even, though the boys\ncome in the middle. But the boys have much more of a vernacular New York way of\nspeaking, and uh... But anyway, they...they were - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they\nwere not so interesting to me when I was a little girl. And I did occasionally go to the store\nand so on. But the thing that I remember just incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere\nalong the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this\nabsolutely horrible teacher. I mean, it was a dollar an hour. And I don't know whether that\nwas a lot in those days - I think it was not even a lot in those days. But she was...she was not\na very good teacher. Uh but anyway. And I only took lessons for maybe a year or\nsomething, but somehow in the course of that year--or maybe it was a little longer--there\nwere two recitals where I played, you know, a diddley something-- \"In My Country Garden,\"\nor something-- for you know thirty seconds. At one of these recitals uh... and you have to\nunderstand that in those days I could never have anything that any of the other kids had, and\nI rationalized it very well. I always said I didn't want any of the other things. But uh at\nEaster time, you know, the other kids would get new suits, and I...I usually didn't, and so on.\nLeon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet\nof pink peonies, you know; which are these really hugh full flowers. And I...I Just will never\nforget that. I mean, that was...that made quite an impression. And just a few months ago, I\nwas thumbing through one of my mother's old photo albums and on one of the last pages\nthis, there was this bunch of flower petals, and in one corner one of these flower petals - you\nknow, they were all brown, there was still a little bit of pink and I suddenly realized that\nthose were probably the left-over of the pink peonies uh so that was one thing. Then I\nremember Leon Klinghoffer went into the army and I remember hearing that he uh I don't\nknow whether - but anyway something happened and I guess he was in Europe and he\nbecame hard of hearing in one ear uh and then he came back and he met this very attractive\ndoll-like woman who he married, Marilyn Klinghoffer. Uh and I remember sort of thinking,\nbecause he was not really very attractive physically, and uh I think he already then maybe\nhad a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me, and here, you know,\nhe married this incredibly uh pretty uh woman uh and they went on to have kids. And my\nmother kind of kept contact and went to the wedding and I don't remember where I was at\nthe time, but I I didn't go and I didn't see Leon Klinghoffer for a long time. I did\noccasionally, like in college I needed something and I went to his store to buy it and uh but\nabout what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a\nbar mitzvah in Worcester and Leon came. And by that time, he had already had a stroke.\nUh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even\nthen--he pulled me over. And his speech was quite slurred, because of the stroke, at that\ntime; and we just talked for a little while. And he said, \"You know, I want you to know that\nyour mother was really a very good woman.\" Uh, and I...[ remember being incredibly\nimpressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn. And she was still so attractive-looking; and\nthinking, you know, \"What a fantastic lady this is! I mean, she takes care of him, she\nworks...\" And you know, and she had told me all these stories about the some of the things\nshe did for her kids. And I...I really felt this incredible feeling of respect for her; and I took\nher business card, because she was working I think for a publishing company at the time, and\nI put it on my bulletin board. And I said, \"You know, I really think I ought to get to know\nMarilyn better.\" But then, of course, you know, she was in New York and I was in New\nEngland. And uh I guess I talked to her maybe once or twice more at another family\nfunction. And then there was this morning in October of '85. I was sitting at breakfast next\nto my husband, and he had the newspaper open. And I was reading something else. And I,\nout of the corner of my eye, I saw this picture. And the thought went through my mind,\n\"Gee, that lady looks just like Marilyn Klinghoffer.\" And just seconds later, my husband\nsaid, \"Isn't your cousin's name Klinghoffer?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And he showed me this\narticle uh about the highjacking of the Achille Lauro. And I...I couldn't believe it. And I\nthink it was either later that same day or the next morning, we turned on the television and he\nhad been shot. And I...I mean, I was just totally incredulous. Uh, well, I think would have\nbeen incredulous if it had been anybody that I knew on that ship, anyway. But somehow for\nit to be this person who was part of the family, that helped get us over here; and it was now,\nyou know, forty-five years later. Uh, I mean, I...and you know, I kept...I kept thinking to\nmyself, you know, \"Statistically, what are the chances that these two events should be in the\nsame person's life?\" And I...1t was... Anyway, I went down to that funeral. And that whole\nfamily is very...they are very closed-mouthed about when things go wrong. I mean, in\ncontrast to the people that I hang around with, who...who are very...you know, they sort of\ntalk about this one's got this and this one just had an operation and so on. And so, when I\nwas going down to the funeral, somebody--it was Dorothy, I think--said to me, \"Well, you\nknow, I think Marilyn's been ill.\" And because I have this morbid streak, I mean,\nimmediately the worst thing crossed my mind. But I...you know, nobody had said anything.\nAnd so... But then after the funeral, everybody went to Marilyn's house; and she just looked\nlike living Hell. And I, as I was leaving to go back on the train, I...I kissed her good-bye.\nAnd I ...and I said, you know, \"Well, maybe you'd like to come up and visit us, or something.\nAnd I'll see you again.\" And she sort of looked at me; and she said, you know, \"OK,\ndarling. And uh...and I...[ thought, \"Something is wrong with this woman.\" And a minute\nlater, I said, you know, \"Don't be silly!\" I mean, you know, how would you look if you had\njust been through this whole thing, and...and your husband had been shot, and so on? And\nuh...and then nobody said anything. And then I remember, in...I guess it was in December,\nwe wake up to the news; and the minute the news went on, the first thing was that Marilyn\nKlinghoffer had died of cancer. And, you know, it was just...well, I...I1 never knew her that\nwell. And I just...you know, I just felt very sad, because I somehow thought that I'd like to\nget to know her better and I never did. And all those other good things. But, so uh...that's\nthe connection.",
        "Q: OK. Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you.\nDOCUMENTS & PHOTOGRAPHS\n(1) Uh this 1s my mother and my father and I think this was probably uh shortly after they had\ngotten either engaged or married, which I think must have been about 1925. They got\nengaged in '25; so this is from that general period. My brother was born in '27.\n(2) This is a picture that was taken shortly after my father's death. And uh uh that's me cheek-to-\ncheek with my mother, and uh that's my brother on the other side. And uh I don't know.\nSomehow, to me this picture says it all. It's just, I mean, all the faces look very grief-\nstricken. And especially--I didn't mention this before, but--my brother. Who, of course, was\nmuch older; was uh...he, I guess he never got along very well with my mother. But he really\nliked my father very much. And I think he was incredibly devastated. And I think during\nthose times when my father was so uh depressed, I know he told me that that my mother just\ncouldn't take it anymore and she would go off and do other things. And he would stand in a\ndark room, just holding my father's hand. And I think...I think he was just totally, you know,\nknocked for a loop that his favorite parent was taken away from him that way. And I think it\nreally shows in his face. And I think uh...I think you can see in my mother's face that she 1s\njust totally, you know, broken up; and...and I have a feeling that I probably didn't really\nunderstand too much about what was going on. But I think I must have reflected all the\nfeelings that were happening around me.\n(3) Uh, this June there was a 50th reunion of the survivors of the St. Louis uh in Miami. And uh\none evening, there was a dinner and a lot of people brought various artifacts. And this uh\nwoman by the name of Mr.... Actually, a couple--the Irones (ph)--brought a photo album;\nand I was sort of thumbing through it, and I found these two photographs with me in it. And\nthis one not only had me--and here I am, right here--uh but this one also had a picture of my\nbrother looking absolutely miserable. And my first thought was that he look miserable\nbecause he was forced to wear a double-breasted suit with short pants. But uh I think he\nlooked miserable because he just really knew what was going on; and I think he was very\nserious and unhappy on the trip. But I guess this was mostly a group of the children; uh and\nthis is actually the woman with whom I roomed at the reunion, and who I had gone to visit\nabout fifteen years ago. She lives near Philadelphia. Uh, so that was a great find.\n(4) This is a photograph of one page of our passport, which we have in a very well-preserved\ncondition. It's the usual passport, with the swastika on the cover and a big red J; and uh it\nhas a lot of information. It tells that we left from Hamburghafen on May 13th, 1939. And\nthen it has a picture of my mother on one page, and our names with the uh the Jewish middle\nnames--uh, Sarah for me--appended. And on this page, it says in French: \"Refugees of the\nS.S. St. Louis. Reif, Chaje\"--which is my mother's Jewish name--\"et ses deux enfants, uh\nFriedrich et Liane\"--\"and her two children, Frederick and Liane.\" Uh, and of course there\nare many such passports. But for me, uh somehow especially because I didn't think about\nthis for such a long time, every once in a while when this whole episode comes into my\nmind, I sort of think, you know, this...this can't possibly really have happened to me. This is\nsome movie I saw, or some dream. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION. And then I go and\nfish out the passport, and convince myself that it really was real.",

        "A: My name is Liane Reif-Lehrer.",
        "A: Iwas born in Vienna, Austria, Zweitebitziek, on November 14th, 1934.",
        "A: Uh, my father was born in Poland, and came to Vienna to go to medical school. And then uh\nwent on, after he finished medical school, to study dentistry; and then opened a dental\npractice uh in Vienna. Uh, my mother was also born in Poland; and came to Vienna, I think,\nprobably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that.\nAnd somehow met my father. Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in\nVienna. And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's\npractice off the ground. And I think during those early years my mother helped out--\nanswering the phone and...and things like that. But then after that, she really did not work as\nlong as we were still in Europe. And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was\ninside our house. There were two apartments that ...and they had the wall broken down\nbetween them. So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen rooms on one\nlevel. At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our living quarters. Uh,\nso I guess it...it was fairly thriving. And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social\nactivity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know. Maybe some theater.\nAnd uh I think once a week they went to some relatives' and played cards. And uh, you\nknow, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have\nbeen doing.",
        "A: Well, my memories are very spotty. Uh, but uh...[ remember ...J remember my father's\noffice, and I remember my own room and I remember parts of the layout of the apartment\nquite well. Not all of it. I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map. But I uh...I remember\nthe dining room, for example; and I remember the kitchen. Uh, I think I liked messing\naround in the kitchen a lot. And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in\nthere and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that. Uh\n,the cook used to let me stand up on a chair and help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother\nwas not too thrilled about that. Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act...\nWe...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but \"servants,\" in the house. I mean,\npeople who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were\nsort of fun for me. And I remember a fair number of...of things. Like when they uh ...they\nused to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the roof\nmaybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles. And when they rolled up...\nEspecially there were long hallways in the apartment. So we had these long runners, and\nthey would let me stand or sit on one end; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a\nride. Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know,\ngetting swung in the sheets. Uh, and I remember getting rides on brooms. You know, I'd put\nmy feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along. Uh, so I remember that.\n[...1 remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my\nroom, actually. I think in my room there was my uh sort of crib and...and maybe... I only\nremember that there was a crib, although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to\nbelieve that I still slept in a crib. But who knows? And then right in...in uh line with that,\nthere was this other bed where I think the governess slept. Uh, and I remember quite well\nthe layout of my room and where there was a dresser, and I think there was a furry animal,\nand...and where the window was. Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about\nthose early uh years.",
        "A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the Vienna era about people.\nUh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was\nyounger. But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we\nwere already in the United States long since by that time. But my mother always had a large\npicture of my father on her bed, uh her night table; and I remember a day when I looked at\nthat picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered\nhaving then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph.",
        "A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about\nKristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity. Uh, my mother was holding\nme in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt. Uh, and there was this knock at\nthe door. And uh I re...1 mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the\nevening. And uh my mother went to... We had one of these peepholes that has like a metal\ncover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody\nwhammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass. And then the superintendent called\nout, \"Don't worry for life. It's just me; let us in.\" I thought two men came in, but my brother\ntells me actually were five or six. Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant. And uh I\nthink they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually. They kind of rummaged through\nthe house. And I...and I...they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically\nremember them taking is that the cook... There was a white closet in the kitchen where they\nkept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things. And...and there was a uh...a tall\ncan from these things called \"pastilles,\" which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind.\nAnd this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are\nsort of like pennies. And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they\ntook that. And I was not disturbed...[ don't remember being disturbed about them taking\nanything else. But I remember being disturbed about them taking that. And uh...so that\nevening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind. But I...you know, then it blacks\nout on either side of that. Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother-\n-who has often asked me, you know, \"Why do you think backwards instead of living your\nlife forwards?\" Uh, and I...I mean, that's a hard question to answer. But about a year ago,\nwhen he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter. I\nsuddenly realized that I guess... guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that\nera, it's perhaps a little easier. I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what\nhappened and then what happened. And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of\na black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open. And uh\nI guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I\nsuppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person\nor some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to\nremind me of... But I...I can't get it back. And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a\nlot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me,\nand...aand so on. And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that\nrelationship might have been like, but I can't. I can't bring it back.",
        "A: Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father\nwas one of uh quite a few children. And some people say five, some people say seven, some\npeople say nine. I don't know. I have a feeling it was either seven or nine. Uh, and there\nactually was a set of twins in the family. But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to\nAmerica, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's. And there had been some talk in the family,\napparently, of coming to America to join them. Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk\ngot more. Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, \"Look, I'm forty years old.\nI don't know English. Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in America\nwithout extensive re-training. How can I...? And, you know, I have such a good practice\nhere. How can I just get up and go?\" Uh, well, my father never made it to Kristallnacht.\nUh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave. And so, uh on\nthe morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the house in the morning to\ndo a number of chores. And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did.\nUh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they\nwere supposed to meet, I think, either at home or at the home of this cousin where they\nsometimes played cards. But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon. And my\nfather never came back. And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story\nstairwell. And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly\ndepressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer\nallowed to to work. Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide. And so I kind of grew\nup with uh...[ mean, a very strange thing. I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had\ncommitted suicide. Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and\nshe...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that. And I think, really, that\nmust have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up. But anyway, you know,\nI didn't really think about it very much uh either. As an adult now, as I look back and I ask\npeople, \"Well, how...?\" You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things\nthat were being done to people, my question has been: \"How do you know that he jumped?\"\nAnd, well, you know, and they say, \"Well, we don't know that he jumped. But he was very\ndepressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide.\" And uh...and my brother also\nprovides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would\nbe better off without a male. Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this. But I can't help\nalways wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him?\nI mean, nobody would know the difference. So I don't know what the answer to that is.\nBut, anyway, he never came back.",
        "A: And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morning were taken on\nKristallnacht. So...",
        "A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately\ndid. I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which\nwas my father's sister in New York. Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this\nwas, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous van came to the house.\nAnd my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's\ndeath. Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think,\nthe packing of this van. Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what\ncame out of it at the other end. And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous\nassortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects. But anyway, this van was\npacked, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to New York; and\nit was in storage for three years until we finally came there. Uh, so I...I do think I remember\nthe day the van was being packed. But then again, there 1s...",
        "A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this ship that was leaving from\nHamburg, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here. Uh, and because people were\nnot allowed to take money out of the country--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars\nper person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class\ntickets, uh bought first class tickets. Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you\nmight as well, you know, spend it on this. Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got\nthese visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money. Uh, and on...in early May of 1939,\nwe took a train to Hamburg uh to get on this boat. Now, I don't remember anything about\nthe voyage except, I think, I remember two things. One is that there's kind of a sense of fear\nthat I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of checkpoints. And I think that\npart of that must have started at that time. And from what my brother tells me it was very\nscary in Hamburg, because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on? Was\nsomething going to happen before you get on got on? And so on. Uh, and the other thing is\nthat I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the ship;\nand I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white\nsun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. (Laughter) Uh,\nand then I don't remember anything else from from the ship. But uh...I mean, I know that the\nship, of course, came to Cuba and we were not allowed in. Uh, and my brother tells me that\nuh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in Cuba at\nthat the time that the boat docked. And he rode out on a little boat to come and see us. Uh...",
        "A: Well, we were quite friendly with them then when we came to the United States. But I think\nwe were friends...I'm not sure that our parents were such good friends. I have a feeling that\nthe friendship might have come about through the friendship between their son and my\nbrother, but I'm not sure about that. But they certainly figured in our lives. I mean, I...I\nremem...they were always talked about. Uh, so he came to the ship, to...to see us,\napparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the ship 1is...1s\nof course well-known, historically. And the ship was turned back, and we went to France.\nAnd that's when I start to have much more coherent memories.",
        "A: You mean, when we got back to France?",
        "A: Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little town in uh centrally...central France called Loudun.",
        "A: I don't remember getting to Loudun. But uh in Loudun, we were put up in this hotel. And I\nguess there must have been a group of about twenty of us from the St. Louis. Uh, and I\nremember this hotel, and I remember this...what I thought was a very, very large square in\nfront of the hotel. But in my adult life--when I went back in 1978, I think it was, to Loudun-\n-the square didn't look nearly as large as I remembered it. (Laughter) Uh, uh the things I\nremember from the hotel in Loudun: uh, I remember where our room was--it was a little\nroom on the side. And uh...and I remember some fairly dramatic things. I remember having\nthis little so-called boyfriend that I guess I played with. Uh... What I remember much more\ndramatically are two things. Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember. I\nremember my mother was always very neat and clean. Uh, and I remember that my mother\nwas really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this hotel, and that there were cats running\naround on the food preparation tables. Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely\nhorrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the hotel. There were toilets, but\nno, you know, bathing rooms. And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the\nhotel where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know. And\nmy mother was totally horrified by that. And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did\ntalk about \"You don't know how much perfume this lady wore,\" and so on. So I remember\ntrivia like that, and I remember somehow running around. And I remember uh...I remember\nonce these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a\nchicken that was going to be used for dinner. And...and that was really... remember that\nwith great horror. You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me. Uh, so\nI remember that. But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke\nup and there uh was this incredible commotion outside. And there were uh shots; and, I\nmean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were. And the Germans had\ncome in to Loudun. And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived\nin this hotel, and uh a lot of the German soldiers either... I don't know if they also lived\nthere, but they certainly were around all the time and they had meals there. And one of the\nthings that I remember, to this day, being incredibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I\nwas only about five and a half or so--uh is that I was... First of all, you have to understand I\nwas always a very \"good girl,\" and I always did everything I was told. Uh, and I was told\nthat under no circumstances was I to let on that I spoke German. Now, how they expected to\nperpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French. My brother had had\nFrench lessons in Vienna, so he probably did have some command of French. But I was\nkind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me. And I remember\nvery clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, \"Je ne comprends pas. Je ne\ncomprends pas.\" And I remember also thinking that there was something very funny about, I\nguess, having always been taught that you're not supposed to lie and here I was being\ninstructed to tell this out-and-out lie. And also nobody explained to me why I was telling\nthis lie. And so I was really very perplexed, I think, by this whole thing. But I did exactly\nwhat I was told. And I remember the soldiers saying all these things to me--which I, of\ncourse, understood perfectly--but just saying \"Je ne comprends pas.\" So that was one thing.\nAnother thing... Oh, even before that time, there was one other thing I remember. There\nwas an air raid one night, and I...somehow I...I got away from my mother and I ran outside.\nAnd they had to come and retrieve me. I somehow thought it was interesting, or fun, or\nwhatever. Uh, but anyway, uh...so for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this hotel in\nLoudun, in the morning the Germans would do these...1 don't know. Whatever you call\nthem--you know, maneuvers or something. They'd march around the hotel in formation,\nwith their big boots and things. And uh my mother and my brother and I would watch from\nthe window. And there was one soldier...and I don't remember his face, but I remember, I\nremember his form. And I remember that he had sort of wavy sandy-colored hair. And I...I\ncan't help wondering, in retrospect, maybe he didn't even know I was Jewish. I mean, or\nmaybe he did. I don't know. I always sort of in the past assumed that he knew. But now I\nthink, \"Well, you know, maybe he didn't know.\" Who knows? But he threw me candies uh\non a number of occasions. And my mother was sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them\nanyway. And here Iam. And then, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me a\nlittle doll. And I think that interaction through; I think that interaction very, very strongly\ncolored my life attitudes. Uh, because I think...I think even then, you know, I somehow must\nhave known that these were the bad guys. But this guy, who I have a feeling might have\nbeen you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was just nice, you know; and he was nice to me.\nUh, and...and maybe I jump to conclusions on very naive grounds; but several years later,\nwhen I came to the United States, and kids would and...and their parents ask me, you know,\nreally ridiculous things to say to a child--like, uh, \"How do you like America?\" And, \"Do\nyou hate the Germans?\" And I remember always saying, \"No, I don't hate the Germans.\nThere are good Germans, and there are bad Germans.\" And I ...1 mean maybe this is\nsimplistic, but I've always thought that it really had to do with this one soldier that somehow\nmade me get a...a very sensible attitude, even though I was so young, about the differences\nbetween people. And I've always sort of very fondly remembered that.",
        "A: Uh, we must have been in Loudun for somewhere between nine months and a year.",
        "A: I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I had realized this more when she was still around--\nmy mother must have really, basically, been an incredibly strong person to have gone\nthrough that. Because when I try to think back on it, I often think I...you know, I don't think\nI could have done the things that she did.",
        "A: [...1 know what you're asking, and I...I really had to give that preamble; because my...my\nsense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow\nnever got it all together except for the practical things. That she somehow was so...I'm not\nsure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic. I mean, she was... And who knows? I\nmean, maybe I would have been the same way. But I mean, she really...she was in mourning\nfor my father for the rest of her life. And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84. I\nguess she was a woman who already had learned something like five languages, but she\ncould not learn French. You know, it was not just there at that time. Uh, and I think uh... I\nwish I could remember the German word that that she used to use a lot. That she was just\nuh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know what to do, you know, with herself or what was\ngoing on, and so on. Uh, and I think the... What she had always told me was that after the\nGermans came into Loudun, that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess,\nuh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in Loudun, and that whether\nshe left or not he was leaving. Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those\nterms. What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some\nrefugees in the hotel, and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there. Uh,\nand there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who\ndecided not to go. And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the\npicture of before. And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947. But\nanyway, so I don't remember that. What I do remember is that one night we left everything\nthat we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and\nstuff. We left everything, and we left in the dark of night. And I think I have a...my\nrecollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin. And this\ngroup of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a train that went\nto the south of France. Uh, and then uh so I remem.... I remember walking to the train\nstation in Loudun, but I don't remember anything of this trip. But what my brother tells me\nis that uh when we got to the border--which I guess was Poitiers--and we had to go through\nthis uh...you know, whatever you do at borders, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940,\nthe lower echelon people in these offices were still French people rather than Germans. And\napparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this office, and said,\n\"Look, you know, I've really got to get across the border, because I'm here and my husband\nis already on the other side.\" And so this woman said, \"Yeah, alright.\" You know, and\nstamped her whatever you needed to get stamped. And then she turned and said, \"You\nknow, that's also the situation for all these other people. They also have somebody else\nwaiting on the other side.\" And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said,\n\"Yeah, yeah. OK.\" And so we all got across. And we went to somehow uh to Limoges, and\nnow that's where my memory picks up again. Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in\nthe railroad station; and I...I remember, I think I slept on a...on a scale. You know, the kind\nof thing you weigh the baggage on. Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just\none night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an\nabandoned uh circus arena that was...I guess it was stone. And uh...and I remember waking\nup the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just\nsleeping on this...on this stone. Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for\nsix weeks and that people graduated. You know, gradually people found places to live, and\nso you kind of got to move to the better seats. And then, apparently, the...the most desirable\nplace was around the periphery of the arena. There were these uh...what I call orange crate\nmake-shift beds that had straw mattresses in them. And so that was... for the last few days\nwe were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those. And then, uh somehow there was a...\nthis Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees. And they found uh a\nuh place that I think had been a pool hall, and there was a small room that must have been...\nI mean, it was really not a very big room. It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty\nfeet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet. Certainly not...not any bigger than that. Uh,\nand there were about thirty women who slept in that room. And then, right above that, there\nwas another room where all the...the men slept. And I don't remember there being any other\nfemale children except for me. And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection\nof anything but adults. And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he\nmight have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well. But then, I mean, this is\nwhere I really start to remember. I mean, I remember this place well. And actually, I went\nback there in 1963 to visit it. And uh so we slept in this room; and at night we had these\nstraw mattresses, and we'd line them up. It was body to body on the floor. Uh, and then in\nthe morning, they would get piled up against the side of the room. And there were all these\nsort of orange crates, you know, really wooden kind of crates that got pulled out. And we sat\non those and...and ate off them and...and so on. And uh so we were in this room for...I don't\nknow, quite a long time. And I began going to school. My first year of schooling was in\nLimoges; and I remember walking to the school, and I remember the classroom. And I still\nhave my three notebooks from that year. And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember\nas a quite not very pleasant woman. And uh she seemed very old to me them. I mean, she\nhad sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she\nsat up on a dias. And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things\nthat stand out in my mind. Uh one is that every morning she would come down every aisle\nof seats with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I\nguess. And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually\nspreading this. And so sure enough, one day I came home and one of the women spotted\nthat I had lice. And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every\nday who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it\nmercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head\nout. So that was kind of horrible. The other thing that I remember is I was ...I was very\nanxious to be very good in school, and I did very well at almost everything except\npenmanship. I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever;\nand I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French 1's and s's you're\nsupposed to have this little bump, you know at the top. And I could never quite get that\nright. I mean, she did...she accepted all the others. I've never had a good penmanship, but\nshe accepted everything else. But she was constantly after me about that little, you know,\nsquiggle that I couldn't get right. So I remember that. The other thing that I remember is\nthat everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get. And so uh I...my\nbrother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh\nsomething that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle. And my mother\ninsisted that we share that. And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this\nmilk. Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that\nI really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I\ngot sent into bakeries to beg for bread. And the line was, \"I've got uh...I have... have\nmoney, and I have ration coupons. But uh...\" Or maybe we didn't have ration coupons,\nwhatever it was, you know. \"...we really need bread.\" And so that was my role. And I\nwould...that bread was not only for us, but 1t would be shared with some of the other people.\nAnd when I was interviewing my brother last year--because I wrote an article about this--\n[...I said to my brother, \"Did it ever occur to anybody how incredibly demeaning it must\nhave been to a little girl to have to go in and beg for bread?\" And my brother, who is a very\npractical person, looked me straight in the eye and said, \"It wasn't demeaning. It was bread.\"\nAnd uh...but somehow I can't feel that way about it. And uh...and I guess... mean, I guess\nwe shared duties in that he had to...all the...you know, he filled out all the forms, and when\nthings had to be packed or when you had to go to an office to ask about visas, I mean, he got\nto do all that. And, of course, I was too young to do that. But uh but I got this horrible chore\nto do, because I was younger and cuter I guess. Uh, so I remember that. Uh, and then I\nremember very clearly, two times uh...I think you were allowed a pound of potatoes per\nmonth per person and one egg per month per person, according to these ration coupons. And\nso, one time my mother heard that there were eggs out in this farm, which was...I mean, I\nremember just walking what seemed like miles and miles and miles. And we came home\nwith these eggs, and my mother opened them and they were all rotten. And then another\ntime, we heard that there were potatoes. And again, I mean, you know, it seemed as though\nwe walked for just ages and we came home with these three pounds of potatoes. And I guess\nwe were just... this is like such a feast that uh my mother just cooked the three pounds of\npotatoes. And I think we just ate them all up. Uh, and then there was a...probably the most\nwonderful birthday of my life happened in this period. I don't know how my mother pulled\nthis off; but on my birthday, uh she came with a little brown paper bag. And 1n this paper\nbag was--I don't remember, I think it might have been like a peach, or...and one other big\nfruit and some dried fruits. And it was probably the nicest present I've ever gotten. So, uh so\nI remember that. And...and the two other dramatic things that I remember from that era is\none that my brother somehow had a Bar Mitzvah in the midst of this. And I don't remember\nmuch about the Bar Mitzvah, except that he was given a...a silk...a beautiful blue silk string\nbag--which we had for years--and it was filled with uh, I don't know, just a lot of different\ngoodies that were kind of nice. Uh so that was one thing I remember. And the other thing--\nand we still have one of these, and it's in my son's car, as a matter of fact. And I just said to\nmy son the other day, \"Don't you ever lose this!\" Uh, somewhere, after...[ don't know\nwhether it was weeks or months, uh two things happened. First of all--and I can't remember\nwhich happened first--but one day these two guys walked down. It was sort of a mild hill,\nthe street we were on; and these two guys came down the hill, and each of them was holding\none end of a bolt of grey blanket cloth. And it...[ mean, I still have it. So I can tell you with\nwith great accuracy that this is the...the worst quality fabric I have ever felt in my life. IL..I\ndon't think it had an 1ota of warmth in it. But uh it was such a...I remember that nice feeling\nof these guys coming with this blanket cloth, and they just had like a knife or something.\nAnd they just stood there and kind of, you know, pulled off...I don't know, maybe a yard and\na half. Uh, and everybody kind of got a square of this, and...and we got two squares. Uh and\nthat was, you know, that was like manna from heaven. Uh, and as I say, that grey blanket is\nin...in ... One of them got lost somewhere; but the other one is in my son's car. Uh, and then\nI guess somewhere along those uh months, the little house right next door to where we were\nstaying became free. And I don't know why we had the good fortune, but the little place next\ndoor was a one...I think it was just a one story place, and it had two rooms. And there was a\nsmaller inner room, and then this larger outer room. And my brother and mother and I were\ngiven that little inner room. And the outer room was kind of divided in half. And the back\npart of it was given to these two sisters who were married to two brothers. And one of the\nbrothers was named [Lutz (ph)]. I don't remember his last name. And he was almost blind.\nHe had very bad vision, and he spent a lot of his time cutting out those kind of leather belt\nloops that, you know, you hook one into the other and make belts. And I...1 remember we\nused to help him do that sometimes. And he did that in the outer part of this room, which\nwas like his workspace. Uh, so those are, those are some of my... Oh, there was one other\nnice thing that I remember from Limoges. There was a...a carpenter that we somehow got to\nknow. Uh, and I think he was kind of a very mellow-looking guy, with maybe reddish kind\nof hair and beard. And you know, he seemed old to me then; but in retrospect he probably\nwas thirty-five or something. Uh but he made a wonderful little set of toy furniture for me\nout of wood, and then he...he glued little pieces of wallpaper on the chairs, you know, to\nmake it look as though they were upholstered. And uh I certainly had those for years and\nyears after that, and always treasured them greatly. Uh, so I guess those are uh... Oh. One\nthing that I didn't mention, uh and this was from Loudun. We went from Loudun to Paris, to\ntry to get visas; and that must have been like late in August of 1939. Uh, and I remember\nthere was an air raid. My mother and my brother and I were in a hotel. There was an air\nraid, and for some reason we didn't hear it and we didn't wake up. Somebody came and\nbanged on our door and woke us up, and we all rushed to this air raid [shelter] in the middle\nof this huge boulevard. And what I remember is that the smell of dog doo in that air raid\nshelter was just overwhelming; and I remember that sort of scary feeling of being down there\nand the sirens and the commotion. And then...and then we were told to go back to Loudun,\nand that we would get visas in, you know, whatever it was--six weeks or something. But\nthen, of course, the war officially started. The Germans came in, and uh...and...and we never\ngot back there. But...but that I do remember--being in Paris in the air raid shelter. So then\nuh... Well, I remember a lot about school. I mean, I remember doing design in school. I\nguess that was one of my favorite subjects. It was uh...1t was...1t was a very controlled kind\nof art class. Design, it was...it was not the kind of thing that kids do now. And you know,\nyou colored in and out the little squares and things.",
        "A: You know, that's a very interesting question. I don't remember having any friends in\nLimoges. I must have known some of the kids in my class. My brother, I think, had a very\nnice sort of older boy, who was a pianist, who took him under his wing and I think did a lot\nfor him. But I don't remember...I don't remember any friends. And I...I think 1t was a very\nlonesome time for me. Uh, but I, you know, somehow I...I played, and I played with the\nlittle doll furniture; and I uh...I think I spent a lot of time in school, and I think my mother\nplayed with me. And I... do remember one thing, actually. And I think this was in\nLimoges, but I'm not sure. Uh, and I think this has also stayed with me for life. I remember\nmy brother was playing with a group of kids his age, and they were running. Maybe they\nwere playing hide-and-seek, or something. And I was trying to keep up with them. And I\nfell, and I remember having these enormous scabs on...on both knees for a long time. And\nI...I...I know I've always had a fear of falling. And when our kids were small, I...I ust found\nit intolerable to see them run. And so I would always let my husband take care of that, you\nknow; and I would sort of turn the other way. Because I didn't want to inhibit them. But uh\n[...1 remember that day, I remember those bloody horrible knees. And...and you know, and\nuh...but I don't remember having any little friends of my own.",
        "A: Uh, we had been in touch with my father's sister and her children, and they were trying very\nhard to get us visas. And apparently we would get a visa; the visas, I guess, expired in fairly\nshort periods. And so we would... apparently, we would get a visa and there would be no\nship, or we couldn't get to the ship. And then there would be a ship, but no visa. And...but\napparently somehow things came together, and we left and went to Marseilles. And again, I\nthought that was just for a couple of days; but my brother tells me we were there for several\nweeks. Uh, and I don't remember Marseilles at all. But apparently my brother did a lot of uh\nleg work there, and it was a matter of just standing in line after line after line. And then,\nfinally, everything worked out. You know, we had to get an entry visa for Spain, and an\nentry visa for Portugal, and an exit visa for France; and it had to be done in the right order,\nbecause, you know, one couldn't be had without the other one first. And apparently there\nwas an incredible amount of... of red tape and bureaucracy and waiting lines, and there was\nno food; and it was just a mess. And I don't remember any of that. The only thing I\nremember quite clearly is getting on a train one night and going through Spain. Now I don't\nremember... didn't remember, until my brother told me, that we stopped I guess twice in\ncities in Spain. But I remember sitting in this train, which was...I mean, it was like New\nYork during rush hour. Uh, and I remember that it was like this sort of totally chaotic scene.\nI mean, there were women in babushkas with big baskets; and I think there was one woman\nwho had a chicken in her basket, you know, tied up with a scarf. And uh this sort of\npandemonium scene, and being on this train. And then I don't remember anything else until\nwe got on the ship going to the U.S. Uh, but my brother uh has a lovely story about going\nthrough the uh border check, uh at the Portuguese border. And he said... you know, I mean,\nthere was no food on the train. It was a mess. It was dirty and everything. And then\neverybody had to get off to go through customs; and my brother said, \"When we got back on\nthe train, it was like a different world. You could smell fresh rolls, and it was all clean.\"\nAnd uh so he...he just, you know... I mean, when he tells that, he just breaks out into this\nwonderful smile. Uh, and I don't remember being in Lisbon. Apparently, we walked around\nthere for two weeks, waiting for this ship--which was called the S.S. Exeter--to sail.",
        "A: We skipped the St. Louis, huh? (Laughter)\nTAPE #2",
        "A: I don't remember anything until we got on the ship. And then I only remember something\nwhich is not very pleasant; and that is, that I guess on the ship uh there was, you know,\nsuddenly food. I mean, real meals, and...you know, and a dining room which looked nice,\nand so on. But all three of us were seasick, essentially, the whole way across the Atlantic.\nAnd so uh I don't think we were able to, after finally getting to some nice food, uh to really\navail ourselves of it. Uh, and I guess that's about all I remember about that trip, uh until we\narrived in the U.S. And one of my earliest recollections, there was something that was very\nuh...1t caused a lot of apprehension in me; because uh I had never seen an oral thermometer,\nbecause in Europe we use these underarm, you know, mammoth-sized thermometers. And\nthese people, I think, in white uniforms came around; and I remember sitting in this big room\nin these chairs, and somebody came around and stuck an oral thermometer in everybody's\nmouth. Uh, so I think I was apprehensive, not only because I was little and I...you know, this\nseemed like really weird. Uh, but as an adult, as I look back, I have a feeling that I also was\nvery aware that this was still another check point and that you could still be turned away.\nAnd I don't know whether somebody had told me that, you know, if you weren't healthy you\ncouldn't come in. I mean, maybe my mother had been talking about that or something. But I\nremember that arrival time as being a time of...of apprehension. And then I remember being\npicked up by the relatives. Uh, and what I...what I remember most dramatically... Well, first\nof all, there was this...I think 1t was a big fancy black car. I mean, not fancy by American\nterms; but to a small kid who, you know, just had not seen anything like this for a long time.\nUh, and I was sitting in the back seat with my mother and my brother. And my mother was\nnext to me, and she was at the window seat; and my aunt lived in uh...in the lower part of\nManhattan, which was not a very nice place--uh, Avenue D. And uh as we drove into that\nneighborhood, my mother...I mean, I could hear her. I could hear her very audibly. My\nmother whispered in German, under her breath, something like, \"Have I suffered so long,\nand come all this way, for this?\" And I think that that was...I mean, that struck me as being...\nI mean, in retrospect... As I think back on it, I don't know what I thought at the time. But in\nretrospect, 1t seems like such an ungrateful statement to make at that moment. Because, you\nknow, I mean, suddenly we were free. And uh...but I think she was so appalled. And I\ndon't...you know, I'm not sure why she was so appalled, because it surely must have been\nbetter than, you know, what had been in France, and so on. But uh...but anyway, that's ...I\nremember her saying that. And uh so then uh we went and lived in my Aunt Lena, who was\nLena Klinghoffer. Uh she had what was really quite a small apartment, and she had five\nchildren. And they were grown; but three of them were still living in this apartment. Uh,\nand Leon and [Albe (ph)], the two boys, were living at home; and the youngest daughter,\nDorothy. Uh, and somehow she made the kids double up. And...and so my brother and my\nmother and I got one tiny bedroom, and we actually lived there with her for about three\nmonths. And uh I guess my mother went out apartment hunting and job hunting, and so on.\nUh, and I mean, I remember a lot of anecdotal things happened in my Aunt Lena's house.\nLike uh uh...I mean, everybody sort of assumed that, because we had been starving for the\nlast two years, that we would eat anything that was put in front of us. Well, that was not true\nat all. My brother and I were the world's fussiest, pickiest eaters. And you know, and this\nfood that was put in front of us was...I mean, it was very alien kind of...of food. Uh, and so\nwe...we...and probably our stomachs were so shrunken anyway that we didn't need very\nmuch. And so we...we were very...you know, we didn't eat a lot of things that were put in\nfront of us. And I think my aunt thought that was very peculiar. And uh uh...and then I...]\nremember, uh you know, my mother had always been very proud of the fact that she never\nlearned to cook, and that she...you know, that other people had done things for her. And uh,\nof course, she very quickly, when we got out apartment, learned how to cook a certain\nnumber of things. But uh she would always say, \"I don't even know how to boil water.\"\nAnd then one time my Aunt Lena got sick, and the kids were out. And...and I think my\nmother really...1 don't know, she was supposed to make some porridge or something. And\nshe really...she sort of couldn't do it, you know. Hard to believe. And I don't know; I\nsometimes get the feeling that it was like almost, you know, could she really not do this? I\nmean, how do you get to grow up and not know how to do this? Or was it all a put-up job?\nWell, I don't know. Uh, turned out that my mother was a very talented lady. And uh...and\nuh very quickly learned how to do all the things that...that were needed. And I think the\nreally sad thing is that uh there was nobody around to really guide her about what she should\ndo. And you know, and...and my Aunt Lena was not a wealthy woman. And uh so I think it\nwas...1t was necessary to uh... to sort of quickly get something going. And so my mother did\nuh the easiest thing, and the first thing that came her way. And she spent the whole rest of\nher life working as a sewing machine operator in a factory. Which was kind of very heavy\nwork, uh but I think... And she's a very hard worker, but... And I think it was not so much\nthe hard work that bothered her; but I think she was...she was very, very bothered by the\nkinds of people that she met in the factory, and she felt totally alien from those people. You\nknow, they uh... I mean, she was...she made acquaintances very easily, but she didn't make\nfriends very easily. Uh, and I think the people that she tended to make real friendships with,\ninsofar as she did, were always, you know, other people her age from Vienna, or other places\nlike that, who sort of...you know, where they could talk about what had been, or whatever it\nwas. Uh, and she just found the conditions in the factory appalling. Uh, I mean she was so\n...first of all, she was so European and so formal. And I mean, it...it drove her crazy that\npeople called her by her first name. I mean, nobody every would have done that. You\nknow, she was \"Frau Dr. Reif,\" and not, you know... And all of a sudden, she's \"Klara.\" Uh,\nshe would come home, and sometimes... I think one time she even cried, because she\nwalked into an office and some guy was sitting at the desk with his feet up; and he didn't take\nhis feet off the desk when she walked in. Well, you know, you didn't treat ladies that way.\nAnd uh uh...and then, I mean, the whole new thing to her was the kind of language that\npeople used in the factory. I mean, she had never heard anything like this before. And so\nshe...you know, and...and gradually she learned to cope with it, and she kind of... You know,\nshe would kid around with people at work; but I don't think she ever, you know, really felt\nhappy in that situation. And as I say, it wasn't just the hard work, but it was really more that\nshe just felt this was not her milieu. Uh so she was a very... mean, she was a very...basically\na lonesome, unhappy woman in many ways in her life. But, on the other hand, on the\nsurface she was not. I mean, she...you know, she always kept herself busy and very involved\nin this and that and the other thing. And she learned English, I think, relatively quickly. Uh,\nand uh she...you know, kept herself active and always knew where all the free concerts and\nfree plays were, and took advantage of all those cultural things, and ran around to the\nmuseums. And uh uh...and so she did all those things. And I...actually, I should say that\nreally was much later; because in the early days, life uh... in the early years, life was very\nvery difficult. So after three months, when we left my Aunt Lena's house and got an\napartment in Brooklyn, uh I think at her first job she was earning $15 a week. And I think\nthe rent was $45 a month in this apartment, or maybe $35 a month. So for...for a long time\nshe hardly ate. I mean, you know, all her money went to paying the rent and feeding us.\nAnd uh...1 mean, she was the usual, you know, Jewish mother. I mean, we came first\nalways, everything, you know. Uh, and she gradually...you know, she...I...she never... I\nmean, she would have been a fantastic bookkeeper, and she would have been so much\nhappier, you know, if somebody had led her into that when she...once she mastered the\nlanguage. But they didn't. So she spent the rest of the time in the factories. And uh she...uh\nshe really...she did not... I don't know what to call it. I mean, for example, my brother and I\nnever worked. You know, and in retrospect that's really weird. Nobody ever asked us to\ncontribute to the family income. Uh, our job was to study; and everything, you know, kind\nof rotated around that. Uh, so that...and in some sense, I mean, you could say that I was a\nspoiled brat once I came here. Because when I wanted to do my homework, I told my\nmother she couldn't wash the dishes until after I finished. Because the noise of the water\nrunning bothered me. So here's this lady who's been working in the factory and then, you\nknow, travelling and...and coming home. And I mean, I did help around the house a little bit.\nUh, but I mean, she basically made dinner and she washed the dishes. I think I sometimes\ndried them. And uh so she did all this work, and then she...she did this incredible\nbookkeeping thing every night. She would not go to sleep until the amount of money in her\nchange purse matched with this little...she had a little book she carried with her. And\nevery...even if it was only two cents, it got written down; uh and it had to match to the\npenny. And she would go over it, and over it and over it again. You know, \"Where did I\nspend that extra ...?\" Whatever, even if it was only three cents, until that matched everyday.\nAnd it got to be funny, because in...1in later years once I remember having a little argument\nwith her about how much a certain dress that I had cost. And she just went right back and\npulled out her book. \"No, that was...you know, it was $13.95!\" (Laughter)",
        "A: Well, uh I think I was kind of a...1n some sense, a dual personality kid. I mean, I was...I liked\nto play, and I was kind of, you know, fun-loving and...on one side. Uh, but there was this\nother side of me that was serious and thoughtful, and I guess introspective and a lot of other\nthings. And...and lonesome. Uh, not the kind of lonesome that... I wrote a poem about this,\nactually. More thinking about my mother; but not the kind of lonesome that goes away\nwhen other people are around, but just a kind of inherent feeling of...1 don't know. Uh, I\nmean, only now in recent years I very often think that the only way I can explain it is, you\nknow, maybe it's what happens to a kid... I mean, what happens when a four year-old kid 1s\ntold that she's never going to see her father again. Especially, you know, having been told\nthat...that he was incredibly affectionate to me. I mean, what does that do? What does that\nmean? Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basically...I...you know, I love to dance and I like to\nsing. I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes. And my brother and I love to tell jokes. Uh\nuh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of my brother, which is much more evident I\nthink in him than in me. But there's a very morbid part of me also. I mean, it's a...I don't,\nyou know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but 1t never goes away. So uh...and then I think, I\nmean, my mother certainly tried very hard. But I think she did and said some things that\nwere not really very good for kids growing up. She always told us that we were different. I\ndon't think that was very good for us. Uh, we were supposed to be \"aristocratic\"--you know,\nin quotes. I mean, that was a myth. I don't...we were not aristocratic in Europe, either. I\nmean, we were just reasonable, middle-classed people. Uh, but uh so I always felt different.\nI felt different, anyway. I mean, you know, I come, here I am at age seven learning my third\nlanguage, and sort of--if you consider the whole Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age\nseven. And I remember coming to school in the U.S.; and you know, all the little girls and\nboys around me are, you know, obviously talking about me. And I can't understand what\nthey're saying. Well, I learned English really fast, let me tell you. Uh, but I always felt\ndifferent. Well, you know, the more different you feel, somehow you stay different and you\nbecome different. And uh uh...and to this day, I still...1 mean, no matter...1 mean, I always\nfeel different. And I think I never thought of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning\nphysicist that they interviewed in the [Boston] Globe; and he said, \"I always felt a little\ndifferent, and it always hurt a little.\" And when I read that, I thought, \"That's...that's\nreally...that describes me.\" Because I think subconsciously, somehow I've always wanted to\nbelong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatever, you know, groups of things. Not ever\nto belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things and I don't want to belong. I don't uh...I don't\nlike being associated with divisive things. I mean, I have very mixed feelings about, you\nknow, even about belonging to the...the quality of being Jewish, or whatever you want to call\nit. Uh, because I think that's very divisive. I mean, I...you know, all the divisive things that\nhave happened in history have happened because people are...you know, belong to...to some\nof these things. So that's not the kind of belonging that I want. But the...belonging to...to,\nfor example, uh... Oh, you know. Within an academic environment, uh people who have\nsimilar interests or people who like to do some activity or something. And I always...I mean,\nI'm 55 years old but I still always feel that there 1s something different about me compared to\nall these other people. And it always...in some strange way, there's a difference. Uh, and\nthen, of course, when I was little, the difference became greatly exacerbated because there\nwas such an an emphasis put on learning and studying and so on. And that was not the\nfavorite activity of most of the other kids at 1092 President Street. And so the other kids\nwould come home and uh go out and, you know, play--this, that and the other thing. And I\nwould very often...I mean, I did play outside in the street, too. But I did a Hell of a lot of\nhomework. And in retrospect, I think I did a lot more homework than was ever assigned.\nUh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids were different. They were not interested.\nAnd I, at some very early age, decided I was going to be a scientist and I was going to do\nthis and that and the other thing. And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations. And uh\nI suppose part of that was enhanced, in that, you know, I mean my mother just kind of\nexpected that we would do things and she knew that they were not going to do things. And\nuh...and I think she did not let that pass quietly by. Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I\nplayed and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not allowed to do anything dangerous. And that\nincluded uh... My mother used to have a fit. I mean, in those days people thought that if you\nwalked up and down the stairs--and we lived on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a\nheart attack. So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time\nI had to walk up and down the stairs. Uh, I was not allowed to uh ride a bicycle, uh when the\nother kids were learning to ride bicycles; and I think...I think partly that was a financial\nmatter. You know, I mean, it took a quarter an hour to rent a bicycle. Uh, but I think mostly\nit was a safety matter. But one of the things that happened very early on is that uh...I mean, I\nhad this brother who was almost eight years older, who was a very...we were very close; and\nI had my mother, who was a very worrisome Jewish mother. And I think very early on,\nthere were many times when my mother would say \"Black,\" and my brother would say,\n\"White.\" And at a very early age, I think I discerned that my brother's responses came from\nthe head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut. And that, obviously, from\nthe head was better. And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to make a\ndecision between the two opinions, I almost invariably did what my brother said. Uh, and he\nwas very protective of me; and we had a very sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in\nretrospect. But it was a very uh uh loving, and very uh you know sort of...we were always,\nyou know, sort of kissing and that kind of thing. And, by and large, people did not yell,\nand...and so on. But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the kitchen,\nbecause I...he had his own room but I studied in the kitchen, uh he would be right there.\n\"What are you saying to this child?\" And uh I remember funny things, like uh if I had a cold\nuh my mother would say, \"Well, maybe you should stay home from school and stay in bed.\"\nAnd my brother said, \"You take two handkerchiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're\nusing the other one. And go to school.\" Well, I mean, I went to school with the two\nhandkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess, I probably spent or tried to spend and\nprobably did spend a certain amount of time with my brother's friends, who were much older\nthan me. I mean, they were adults and I was still a kid. And I think they were trying to get\nrid of me a certain amount of the time. I mean, they did...my brother took me to my first\nmuseum. And one of his friends took me to my first ballet, and so on. Uh, and I remember\nonce my mother getting involved, because my brother didn't want to take me someplace he\nwas going with a friend. And my mother - I remember this 1s so ridiculous - my mother said,\n\"You can't go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't.\"\n(Laughter) Uh, so it was not a typical childhood, in that sense.",
        "A: Well, uh, yeah. I think maybe I'd like to mention that I talk about this very easily now, but\nthat all the times when my mother was still alive and that she wanted to talk about some of\nthese things, I really didn't want to hear about it. I didn't want to listen. Uh, first of all,\nbecause she would get very emotional, and I... And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate\nthat. Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my\nkids responding in the same way. I mean, that [they] don't really need this. Uh, and so I\nreally went through very many years, essentially, not thinking very much about this and\nmaking believe it never happened. And when the other kids or other people would ask me,\n\"Well, what effect do you think your background had on you?\" I would say, \"Well, I was\ntoo young and I don't remember anything, and I don't think it had any effect on me.\" And I\nthink uh--and I've been trying to write about some of these issues--I think that there's a\ncertain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and\nyou're sort of building your life and it's very easy to sort of not look back and push\neverything aside. And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think\nfor other people also, somehow the back...background comes back to haunt you. And it\nwasn't really until after our kids were born, and...and uh you know maybe when I was about\n35, that I started noticing that I...that certain things I did were not really logically explainable\nby...by things that were happening then. And that the only logical explanation of why I was\ndoing certain things in that way, or doing them at all, had to do probably with some of the\nthings that had happened very early in life in Vienna. And you know, my father\ndisappearing and uh...and things that happened tn... in France and uh...and in that school in\nLimoges, and uh... and that whole business of sort always being on the run for those years,\nand being scared, and uh... And I think there is a lot of interesting material uh to explore\nthere. Uh, and uh...and to explore with other people who have had similar experiences. Uh,\nI think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, I mean, I would always like to have a\ncontrolled experiment, and of course there is no controlled experiment--but trying to pick\napart. Uh, and of course it's only conjectural, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but\nsomehow trying to define for myself, you know, what things that have stayed with me are\nreally due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in\nFrance, and so on. And what things are just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents\nby and large are crazy anyway. Right? And...and so you, your parents uh somehow inflict\non you uh some of that craziness that they have. Uh, and it's hard to tell, because of course I\ndon't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started. And it's only in\nrecent years, and actually since she's died, that I've really thought enough about this to to\nrealize that, you know, she might have been and probably was a very sort of, you know,\nhappy carefree person in many ways uh but I never knew her. I mean, my mother wore\nblack for years and years and years; and then she finally switched to navy. And it was, you\nknow, it was only very very late, when I was already essentially an adult that she would ever\nwear anything that was red, or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she\nkept up on [my] father's grave. She always you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle. Uh uh she\nshe always uh...you know, I mean, she always I think in...1n many ways--in her thoughts, at\nleast--she always lived in her past. Not...not in her actions, but you know... \"If I only had\nmy sister to talk to,\" and so on. And then one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh\nbecause I...1 do remember this and it was very dramatic was right after the war was over.\nThere was a blue letter that arrived from...I think it was from a cousin of my mother's who\nended up in Israel--and I don't know if he's still alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had\nhappened to many of our relatives. And I mean, that, you know, I remember it as being\nhorrendous; but now, when I think back, that must have been just such an incredible\nnightmare to my mother. Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean,\nessentially everybody was killed, and...and some of them in rather grotesque ways. Uh and\n[...1 guess I wish I could have been a little bit more understanding of me in relation to my\nbackground, and I think that would have lead to...to my having a better understanding and\nappreciation of my mother uh during those years. Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got\nalong very well uh until the other girls started dating. And then she got... END OF TAPE\n...like our live-in baby sitters. And I had my very strong, very very democratic ideas about\nuh...you know, the way those people should be done, should be treated. And I...and I think\nin some sense there was kind of...I guess, she verbalized it often. She felt that we treated our\nlive-in baby sitters better than we treated her. And that was probably true, because they\ndidn't sort of interfere in our lives. And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when\nshe should have become a friend. And I think...I mean, in retrospect now that was because\nshe was very lonesome. So there's a lot more, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it\nsometime.",
        "A: Is there anything else you wanted to...?\nyou describe him as a child?",
        "A: Uh, I remember...I remember all five children uh very well. Uh, I guess I sort of uh really\nliked at first the youngest daughter best, because she was so pretty and dynamic and she\ndressed so nicely. And I was a little girl, and uh...and I guess, I didn't take very much\ninterest in the two boys. I think partly because they were involved in, you know, they ran\nthis hardware store and they were busy; but I think also they seemed a little gruff to me. Uh,\nthe girls, all - actually it's funny - the girls were all very well-spoken even, though the boys\ncome in the middle. But the boys have much more of a vernacular New York way of\nspeaking, and uh... But anyway, they...they were - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they\nwere not so interesting to me when I was a little girl. And I did occasionally go to the store\nand so on. But the thing that I remember just incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere\nalong the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this\nabsolutely horrible teacher. I mean, it was a dollar an hour. And I don't know whether that\nwas a lot in those days - I think it was not even a lot in those days. But she was...she was not\na very good teacher. Uh but anyway. And I only took lessons for maybe a year or\nsomething, but somehow in the course of that year--or maybe it was a little longer--there\nwere two recitals where I played, you know, a diddley something-- \"In My Country Garden,\"\nor something-- for you know thirty seconds. At one of these recitals uh... and you have to\nunderstand that in those days I could never have anything that any of the other kids had, and\nI rationalized it very well. I always said I didn't want any of the other things. But uh at\nEaster time, you know, the other kids would get new suits, and I...I usually didn't, and so on.\nLeon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet\nof pink peonies, you know; which are these really hugh full flowers. And I...I Just will never\nforget that. I mean, that was...that made quite an impression. And just a few months ago, I\nwas thumbing through one of my mother's old photo albums and on one of the last pages\nthis, there was this bunch of flower petals, and in one corner one of these flower petals - you\nknow, they were all brown, there was still a little bit of pink and I suddenly realized that\nthose were probably the left-over of the pink peonies uh so that was one thing. Then I\nremember Leon Klinghoffer went into the army and I remember hearing that he uh I don't\nknow whether - but anyway something happened and I guess he was in Europe and he\nbecame hard of hearing in one ear uh and then he came back and he met this very attractive\ndoll-like woman who he married, Marilyn Klinghoffer. Uh and I remember sort of thinking,\nbecause he was not really very attractive physically, and uh I think he already then maybe\nhad a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me, and here, you know,\nhe married this incredibly uh pretty uh woman uh and they went on to have kids. And my\nmother kind of kept contact and went to the wedding and I don't remember where I was at\nthe time, but I I didn't go and I didn't see Leon Klinghoffer for a long time. I did\noccasionally, like in college I needed something and I went to his store to buy it and uh but\nabout what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a\nbar mitzvah in Worcester and Leon came. And by that time, he had already had a stroke.\nUh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even\nthen--he pulled me over. And his speech was quite slurred, because of the stroke, at that\ntime; and we just talked for a little while. And he said, \"You know, I want you to know that\nyour mother was really a very good woman.\" Uh, and I...[ remember being incredibly\nimpressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn. And she was still so attractive-looking; and\nthinking, you know, \"What a fantastic lady this is! I mean, she takes care of him, she\nworks...\" And you know, and she had told me all these stories about the some of the things\nshe did for her kids. And I...I really felt this incredible feeling of respect for her; and I took\nher business card, because she was working I think for a publishing company at the time, and\nI put it on my bulletin board. And I said, \"You know, I really think I ought to get to know\nMarilyn better.\" But then, of course, you know, she was in New York and I was in New\nEngland. And uh I guess I talked to her maybe once or twice more at another family\nfunction. And then there was this morning in October of '85. I was sitting at breakfast next\nto my husband, and he had the newspaper open. And I was reading something else. And I,\nout of the corner of my eye, I saw this picture. And the thought went through my mind,\n\"Gee, that lady looks just like Marilyn Klinghoffer.\" And just seconds later, my husband\nsaid, \"Isn't your cousin's name Klinghoffer?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And he showed me this\narticle uh about the highjacking of the Achille Lauro. And I...I couldn't believe it. And I\nthink it was either later that same day or the next morning, we turned on the television and he\nhad been shot. And I...I mean, I was just totally incredulous. Uh, well, I think would have\nbeen incredulous if it had been anybody that I knew on that ship, anyway. But somehow for\nit to be this person who was part of the family, that helped get us over here; and it was now,\nyou know, forty-five years later. Uh, I mean, I...and you know, I kept...I kept thinking to\nmyself, you know, \"Statistically, what are the chances that these two events should be in the\nsame person's life?\" And I...1t was... Anyway, I went down to that funeral. And that whole\nfamily is very...they are very closed-mouthed about when things go wrong. I mean, in\ncontrast to the people that I hang around with, who...who are very...you know, they sort of\ntalk about this one's got this and this one just had an operation and so on. And so, when I\nwas going down to the funeral, somebody--it was Dorothy, I think--said to me, \"Well, you\nknow, I think Marilyn's been ill.\" And because I have this morbid streak, I mean,\nimmediately the worst thing crossed my mind. But I...you know, nobody had said anything.\nAnd so... But then after the funeral, everybody went to Marilyn's house; and she just looked\nlike living Hell. And I, as I was leaving to go back on the train, I...I kissed her good-bye.\nAnd I ...and I said, you know, \"Well, maybe you'd like to come up and visit us, or something.\nAnd I'll see you again.\" And she sort of looked at me; and she said, you know, \"OK,\ndarling. And uh...and I...[ thought, \"Something is wrong with this woman.\" And a minute\nlater, I said, you know, \"Don't be silly!\" I mean, you know, how would you look if you had\njust been through this whole thing, and...and your husband had been shot, and so on? And\nuh...and then nobody said anything. And then I remember, in...I guess it was in December,\nwe wake up to the news; and the minute the news went on, the first thing was that Marilyn\nKlinghoffer had died of cancer. And, you know, it was just...well, I...I1 never knew her that\nwell. And I just...you know, I just felt very sad, because I somehow thought that I'd like to\nget to know her better and I never did. And all those other good things. But, so uh...that's\nthe connection.",
        "A: Thank you.\nDOCUMENTS & PHOTOGRAPHS\n(1) Uh this 1s my mother and my father and I think this was probably uh shortly after they had\ngotten either engaged or married, which I think must have been about 1925. They got\nengaged in '25; so this is from that general period. My brother was born in '27.\n(2) This is a picture that was taken shortly after my father's death. And uh uh that's me cheek-to-\ncheek with my mother, and uh that's my brother on the other side. And uh I don't know.\nSomehow, to me this picture says it all. It's just, I mean, all the faces look very grief-\nstricken. And especially--I didn't mention this before, but--my brother. Who, of course, was\nmuch older; was uh...he, I guess he never got along very well with my mother. But he really\nliked my father very much. And I think he was incredibly devastated. And I think during\nthose times when my father was so uh depressed, I know he told me that that my mother just\ncouldn't take it anymore and she would go off and do other things. And he would stand in a\ndark room, just holding my father's hand. And I think...I think he was just totally, you know,\nknocked for a loop that his favorite parent was taken away from him that way. And I think it\nreally shows in his face. And I think uh...I think you can see in my mother's face that she 1s\njust totally, you know, broken up; and...and I have a feeling that I probably didn't really\nunderstand too much about what was going on. But I think I must have reflected all the\nfeelings that were happening around me.\n(3) Uh, this June there was a 50th reunion of the survivors of the St. Louis uh in Miami. And uh\none evening, there was a dinner and a lot of people brought various artifacts. And this uh\nwoman by the name of Mr.... Actually, a couple--the Irones (ph)--brought a photo album;\nand I was sort of thumbing through it, and I found these two photographs with me in it. And\nthis one not only had me--and here I am, right here--uh but this one also had a picture of my\nbrother looking absolutely miserable. And my first thought was that he look miserable\nbecause he was forced to wear a double-breasted suit with short pants. But uh I think he\nlooked miserable because he just really knew what was going on; and I think he was very\nserious and unhappy on the trip. But I guess this was mostly a group of the children; uh and\nthis is actually the woman with whom I roomed at the reunion, and who I had gone to visit\nabout fifteen years ago. She lives near Philadelphia. Uh, so that was a great find.\n(4) This is a photograph of one page of our passport, which we have in a very well-preserved\ncondition. It's the usual passport, with the swastika on the cover and a big red J; and uh it\nhas a lot of information. It tells that we left from Hamburghafen on May 13th, 1939. And\nthen it has a picture of my mother on one page, and our names with the uh the Jewish middle\nnames--uh, Sarah for me--appended. And on this page, it says in French: \"Refugees of the\nS.S. St. Louis. Reif, Chaje\"--which is my mother's Jewish name--\"et ses deux enfants, uh\nFriedrich et Liane\"--\"and her two children, Frederick and Liane.\" Uh, and of course there\nare many such passports. But for me, uh somehow especially because I didn't think about\nthis for such a long time, every once in a while when this whole episode comes into my\nmind, I sort of think, you know, this...this can't possibly really have happened to me. This is\nsome movie I saw, or some dream. TECHNICAL CONVERSATION. And then I go and\nfish out the passport, and convince myself that it really was real.\n"
