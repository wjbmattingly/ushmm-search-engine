I had a first cousin, Suzanna, that I was\nseeing from first grade on together. She was not there anymore. She was assigned to some other\njob. So anyway she became Suzy Jakab. And was represented a sister of mine and we really\nstayed together to the very end. Now the interesting thing it was, that for me to work outdoors,\nshoveling things, it's very difficult, I'm not physically strong. She was very strong physically so\nshe took over the heavy job. And the job she got that was a sort of like a railroad inside the big\nbarn looking thing that they were transporting items from one to the other. She taught me how to\nuse that particular machinery. It was something like a railroad. And you had a little, like a little\nchoo choo train to drive it. I drove it several times against the wall. That they didn't kill me for\nit I don't know, but anyway I did it. But what did she teach me to do, I never did in my life to\nsabotage the inside, what is inside.

        "Q: Why do you think you were so brave?",

I mean it's unbelievable.\nFor instance for many, many years, many, many people ask, you know, did you tell your\nchildren? I said why should I darken their young ears with horror stories such as this? And I\nnever did. It was very difficult for me to even think about these things, nevertheless to talk to\nmy own kids or to my grandchildren. Sometimes my son asked about interesting stories.

        "A: No, that happened already when we arrived to the Saar region. We were dancing in one of\nthose bunkers, all right? The place where we arrived was heavily bunked by the Germans. And\nthey asked for five volunteer women to peel potatoes. And that was asked by German soldiers.\nAnd we decided what did we have to lose, at least we eat for a few days because whatever\nrations they gave, if you peel potatoes, we get the benefit ourselves. So we went potato peeling,\nfive of us. That was myself and my stepsister and three other women. And after about a week of\nthis treat, because really it was a treat because we ate, the soldiers said now you have to return to\nyour camp. And we thought surely the moment we going to turn our back, they are going to\nshoot us, but they didn't. They walked thataway and we walked thataway. And after a few\nminutes we looked back, we didn't see the German soldiers, we saw the bunker flocked down in\nthere. So there was a bombing. The Germans were bombing that Saar region. And my sister or\nstepsister got a shrapnel through her through her leg.",
        "Q: Eye?",
        "A: I was next to her like even closer than I am to you right now. I didn't have a scratch. But\nanyway I ripped up something. I don't know whatever she wore or I wore to make a tourniquet,\nall right? And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the\nwar is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life. It was a hand rolled, hand\nrolled and hand cut tobacco. So anyway I never smoked. And I handed it to my stepsister who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n51\nwas actually in the underground, and she was a smoker already from the age of 16 or whatever,\nnot that it helped her because she wasn't paid. We didn't have anything. So after about a day or\nso ambulance came and took all five of us to a hospital. But three of the women were pretty\ngood looking, hefty looking were raped in front of my eyes.",
        "Q: The other three women?",
        "A: The other three, not me. I was like a walking skeleton and, of course, my stepsister was\ninjured with the tourniquet and the loss of blood so she was got away.",
        "Q: Who raped the other three women, the Russians?",
        "A: Um?",
        "Q: Who raped the women, the Russian soldiers?",
        "A: The Russian soldiers.",
        "Q: Were you afraid it was going to happen to you?",
        "A: Ina way, yes. But then again, I looked at myself, and I said who would want this walking\nskeleton even to touch. I mean I was just really skin and bones even though I was still young.",
        "Q: Had you been getting your period during the war?",
        "A: No, I didn't for a whole year. I didn't for a whole year. I was convinced that there is\nsomething in the food which suppresses all that all that feminine action. I mean it's part of life.",
        "Q: Umhum.",
        "A: But the doctor convinced me that's not the case.",
        "Q: So",
        "A: Actually I became pregnant in August.",
        "Q: We'll talk about that. What was your feeling when the Russian soldier came and told you the\nwar was over? What do you remember what you thought?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n52",
        "A: I was hoping it's true. And then I heard also horrible thing, which I heard. There were very\nfew people sort of half dead, half dead wandering around that camp. It's called Mashata (ph). It\njust occurred to me. Mashata (ph) _ +.",
        "Q: So you didn't quite believe it when you first when the Russian soldiers said the war is over?",
        "A: Not really, however, the Germans did something horrible. There were few sort of half dead\nwandering around. It looked like that the whole camp was either + or diseased or, you know,\njust ready to be buried. The few alive people who were still alive transported on a boat and the\nboat was blown up so they all went down. They all went down. That's awful that the Germans\ndid that. Now, that's something which they they didn't gain by killing another 50 people or\nanother 25 people, but they did it.",
        "Q: After liberation, you were with your sister?",
        "A: So actually what you want me to tell you, what do you want me to tell you?",
        "Q: I want you to tell me about the ending of the war and so now you are in Nostach (ph).",
        "A: Nostach (ph).",
        "Q: Nostach (ph) okay, and your sister, Susan, what happened to her?",
        "A: She was in the hospital, and it just so happened that the farmer's daughter died in the same\nroom where my stepsister was, Suzy. Okay? And I went to that farmer. I said I will be glad to\nwork for them if they let me visit my sister at least once a day or at least three times a week so I\nsee how she's getting along. So I was so I was with Polish farmer. They didn't even know I'm\nJewish. And I never advertised it because I didn't know. I didn't trust them.",
        "Q: What were you wearing though, didn't you have",
        "A: I still had the so I was a political prisoner.",
        "Q: You took your star off?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n a3",
        "A: I took my star off, but I was a political prisoner.",
        "Q: When did you take your star off?",
        "A: Sometime in the hospital most likely.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All right? The number didn't make any difference because the political prisoners had\nnumbers also. And they were not that well educated. So anyway I went to see my sister, how\nshe's coming along, and she was sometimes on very high fever. And we were very, very\nconcerned, but she had a very strong constitution and she pulled through very good. And anyway\nI went and I was able to take a little meal again, a little cheese and a little sugar or whatever they\ngave me. God forbid that I should take 1t without asking. But I asked if I may take something\nfor my sister. And I was scrubbing the toilet for them and I was tending the whatever _ or\nfeeding these or whatever I was assigned to do. It didn't make any difference to me as long as I\nwas able to provide a little help for my helper. And slowly but surely she got a little better, but I\ngot very bad, and I was admitted to the hospital for a few weeks for better nourishment, and it\nwas middle of or end of July that finally",
        "Q: Who was running the hospital?",
        "A: The it must have been the",
        "Q: The Russians?",
        "A: Russians, yes. It definitely was. The Saar region was definitely occupied by the Russians,\nyes. And then I was admitted to the hospital for a little better nourishment to build up my\nstrength. And then finally we got our walking papers, and then it took a few kilometers, a very\nfew kilometers either by train or by bus or by whatever to get closer and closer because we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n54\nwanted to approach, again, my city, that if there is anything underway somebody will be\nregistered. And the first sign of registration I found in Budapest. That took a good two months.",
        "Q: How did you ride on the train? Did you need tickets or would they just let you ride?",
        "A: No, we had papers. We had papers, you know, so many kilometers. I mean there was\nalways Jewish communities who were helping people to get home and search for their relatives.",
        "Q: Where did your papers come from, the Jewish community or the Russians?",
        "A: Russian Jewish community.",
        "Q: Gave you papers?",
        "A: German, whoever community gave us papers for the rides.",
        "Q: For the rides?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And then you got to Budapest?",
        "A: I got to Budapest and that's where at first, I found that Imre Wollner is looking for Anna\nWollner. And, of course, I left my that Imre Wollner is looking for Anna Wollner.",
        "Q: What was your feeling when you heard that he was alive?",
        "A: Well, I was very happy at least that I was married and we were in love and it was a\nwonderful feeling, that he's looking for me and I'm looking for him. But I found no trace of my\nparents nor of my brother, and that was a very sad thing. The interesting thing that when we met\nin my city, the first thing I said let's go home. I have a feeling there is nothing to look for and we\ncan find out later if there is anybody alive.",
        "Q: So you went from Budapest back to your town?",
        "A: Back to my town but we stayed there for",
        "Q: And your husband was in the town at the time when you found\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n55",
        "A: No, he came out, I believe, another day or another day later. I don't know. It was something.\nBut anyway we had within a day or so we met.",
        "Q: You were together?",
        "A: The same city where we got married, yes.",
        "Q: And was your stepsister with you?",
        "A: Um?",
        "Q: Was your stepsister with you, Suzy, was she with you, your stepsister, Suzy, was still with\nyou?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: She was still with you?",
        "A: She was still with me and we lost contact only after we got in the United States.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: She was a big Communist. And actually her and my husband didn't get along at all. I mean\nlet's be honest about it. I would like to be honest about it. But I mean really we help each other.\nWe were just really like sisters.",
        "Q: So you saw your husband and you said let's not stay here?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so then what happened?",
        "A: We stayed.",
        "Q: You did stay?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because he wanted to stay?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n _",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, he established with two of his friends, a business which they called\nimport/export _. And it went well. We did pretty good. And Peter was born. Peter was born.\nHe was one of the first in my city. He was born in April.",
        "Q: And you stayed how long?",
        "A: We stayed until King Carl was exiled. I mean he had to leave the country, and then his son,\nMikial (ph) became king. And when he had to leave also, I said I'm not going to raise my son\nunder Stalin after Hitler. And that's when we decided that we leave and how did we leave? We\npaid a peasant to sneak us across the border to Hungary or a hay bagger. And the three of us\nwent to Hungary and then from Hungary to Austria and then from Austria to Munchen. And\nfrom Munchen, we requested the refugee porter to the United States, and it took us a year.\nArriving in the United States in '49, in '49.",

        "Q: So you left with a two year old smuggling in a hay wagon. How did you keep him quiet?",
        "A: The doctor gave him tranquilizer, but it didn't work. He was hollering all through the hay\nride and fell asleep after we got to the Hungarian side, but nothing happened, thank God. He's\nhere. He's here.",
        "Q: And then you went from Munich to the United States?",
        "A: We requested the quota. You know _ + had a refugee quarter so to be accepted as an\nintended United States citizen _ and we got it.",
        "Q: And you came to the United States?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n57",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you come?",
        "A: Also on a boat, steerage.",
        "Q: Umhum.",
        "A: Yes. Arrived to Ellis island. Peter had the measles so we were quarantined. Then we got to\nNew York finally, and I said this is not the city I want to live in United States. And that's how\nwe got to Memphis, Tennessee. I wanted a leisure southern town, friendly so I heard, and it was\nlovely. I really liked Memphis, Tennessee. That's where my kids were educated. There was a\nvery lovely Jewish community. There was a Jewish school. It started with kindergarten, and\nthen it became a yeshiva, a high school for the girls. I mean it really turned out lovely.",
        "Q: Did you get anymore education in the United States?",
        "A: More or less I would call it self taught. I mean I practically lived in the libraries.",
        "Q: Umhum.",
        "A: Catching up things. And also I was accepted, which is a very unusual thing in the niklivi\n(ph) for arts and crafts for _+. I wanted to teach actually in Israel, but at the time that I have\nfinished the nikliv (ph), I would have been a certified teacher, I was close to 60. There is no way\nin the world that you can get a permanent job or __ at that age. There is no way. So I just gave\nup. Who needs a piece of paper if I cannot earn anything with it?",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Every year there is no grandchild that was born without me. And I have 13. God bless them.",
        "Q: Wonderful. Can we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n59",
        "A: [have three great grandchildren. I think I told you. Can we? Yes.",
        "Q: Can we now talk a little bit about your feelings and reflections about your experience? Has\nthe war, your experience during the war, has it made you more Jewish? What is your feelings\nabout being Jewish considering what you went through?",
        "A: I'm very proud to be Jewish. But then again on the other hand, I'm very proud to be Jewish.\nAnd I declare it especially here in the United States when they the people make completely\nuncalled for remarks, you know, jew you down or, you know, expressions such as that. So\nusually make the remark, the Jewish people usually are very fair and sincere, and they don't want\nto cheat people out of anything. As a matter of fact, you can rely on a Jewish person because\nholically (ph) or according to the law it's a sin to cheat. And anybody who's observant is going\nto respect that. There's another thing, which is very much observed that is in the ten\ncommandments to respect and honor your elders. That's a very important thing in the Jewish\nlaw. That's one of the dos instead of do nots. And I think that the almighty was very kind to us.\nThat was when we reach a certain age that we need protection and we need his protection. I\nthink it's wonderful.",
        "Q: You had said that you really didn't talk to your children or grandchildren very much",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: about your experiences. Did you ever share your experiences with others?",
        "A: No, hardly. It's difficult. It hurt to talk about it. It hurts to talk about it. Now, what would I\nsay to a ten year old? And then he's going to look at the other young mothers, maybe they are\nyounger than Iam. I was 30 years old when George was born. And I was 37 when Teddi was\nborn, when my daughter was born. I was 37. She was born in 1960. That is seven years\ndifference between my children. It wasn't my choosing. It just happened so what can I tell a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n <0\nchild about my experiences? And then he's going to look at his best friend that he comes over to\nplay football with or hockey or just do homework together. And then he's going to say, what,\nyour mom I mean this is something, you know, you read not even in history I don't think. They\ndon't even have these things in history books or do they?",
        "Q: Does the war still affect you? Does your experiences and what you suffered still affect you?",
        "A: For a long time I had been asking why me? Somehow I don't ask it anymore. I don't know\nwhy me. I mean really and truly so many so much better people perished. I feel, for instance,\nthat I always envied my brother who's younger than me that he's such he's so much better person\nas a human being than I am. Why not him and why me? Somehow or other I feel guilty about\nbeing alive and him not being alive or, for instance, the event that the war was over, and Hitler\ndoes not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun\nBrown, right? I asked dear God why did we deserve this? Why did you do this to us? What\nhave we done? I mean I'm not speaking only about our group? It happened in Poland. It was\nreally something. So I don't know. I mean I am asking a lot of questions, but I am asking less\nand less as the time goes by. I live to see a whole generation of new grandchildren that my two\nof my granddaughters are married. One of them already have three children. So I have great\ngrandchildren. So maybe there is a purpose in all of these I mean I have three I have a big\nfamily again and I came home alone. Alone with my husband, the two of us. It's not alone\nanymore. But I didn't even know when I was liberated by the Russians that I do have a husband\nhere that took several months to arrive to the particular to that particular moment.",
        "Q: Do you receive war reparations?",
        "A: No, I never asked.",
        "Q: Why not?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n61",
        "A: Because I don't want their money. Money doesn't it doesn't mean that much to me. There is\nnothing they could they could pay me a million, but my mother and father will not rise from\ntheir grave. My parents will always be there, and my brother is nonexistent. I've never asked for\nreparation. I don't want their money. It's very funny. I'm going to have fantastic expenses, and I\nknow that I don't even know if I'm going to survive this ordeal or not, but somehow I feel that I\ndid not leave in vain. And the reparation would make much different. Maybe it would make a\ngreat deal of difference for the children. Maybe I should because of them. But for me money\nhas no, no value in that particular thing. I have seen people selling houses, homes, fortunes,\nyachts for a crust of bread, really. I mean when it comes down to value, what is value? Life is\nvaluable. How you live your life is valuable, but not money. The money is not doesn't\nsomehow or other I am completely nonmaterialistic. Maybe, maybe it's foolish. And I should be\na little bit have a little bit more foresight, and the children are going to be burdened with my\nexpenses and whatever. But for myself, I don't want their money.",
        "Q: Is there anything you wanted to share about being Jewish with your children or grandchildren\nor great grandchildren?",
        "A: Yes, to be proud of it. Just to be proud of the fact that they are they have an inheritance,\nthousands of years old, and be proud of it. It makes me very proud to see my oldest son sit down\nwith the two youngsters, the two ten year olds, Rosalee's son and his son are about the same age.\nAnd he's learning with them half an hour every evening, so he's transferring his knowledge, his\ndoctora with the young children and that's beautiful. To me, it gives a wonderful satisfaction.\nThat's value. To me, that's value. It's not the new outfits, and the new bicycles and pizza shops\nand God knows what, that's beside the point. But the inheritance, our history to be transferred to\nthe children, to teach them how to put the feeling on. To go through bar mitzvah. To be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n =\nprepared he prepares them for the bar mitzvah. He doesn't hire another tutor. It's a wonderful\nthing. To me that means a great deal and so did my younger son, not to mention my daughter.\nThey became so religious. He's teaching in a yeshiva, and she's a__ now. And she's very, very\nrespected in the Jewish community in Brooklyn. And, listen, being in Brooklyn you have to be\nvery religious in order to fit in. And she is fitting in. As a matter of fact, she's a foster mother to\naretired _ besides her own five children. I mean I'm very proud of my kids.",
        "Q: Wonderful. Anything you'd like to add before we finish?",
        "A: Well, I don't know. Ask me. Is there anything I need to add?",
        "Q: Just any other thoughts that you have?",
        "A: Um?",
        "Q: Any other thoughts about what you went through in the war?",
        "A: Well, the only thing is that there must be a purpose, only God knows what that I went\nthrough, and I'm here. It must be a purpose to it. It couldn't be just a coincidence because I think\nthat in our in the whole world, nothing just happens just by coincidence. Why this happened to\nus? Why exactly that particular community, 1t was hit so very hard, only God knows. But I'm\nsure it's not only question of money. We did have some rich people who were able to buy fake\npapers or went to Switzerland or whatever. Still somehow even they getting a certain tradition\nwith us with them. Don't you think? And they assured us or the survivor of certain amount of\npeople. It's could be it was their own family. It could be somebody outside the family, but I\nthink that it nevertheless saved a certain amount of people. So it was not in vain.",

        "A: Did something to my heart.",
        "A: No question about it because of the writings, the Hebrew letters, and that's what we were\nbreaking up. The interesting thing it was, it was very cold.",
        "A: By the time we got to Riga.",
        "A: Not necessarily because after Auschwitz we didn't get straight wait just a moment. We\ndidn't get straight to Riga, and we didn't get straight to Riga, we had a",
        "A: Yes, but I must have been somewhere. Let me have, if I it won't help me. After I went to\nAuschwitz, we were transferred to Stoll and to Stutthof.",
        "A: Labor camps, yes. They were labor camps. Now, here it's a very interesting thing. I got the\njob. I had a very good friend who actually who was actually in the underground in Germany as\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n38\nwell I mean in Austria as well as in Hungary. And we have decided since somehow or other our\nfirst cousins scattered or were assigned different kind of camps. We going to stay like sisters.\nSo she took up my maiden name. Suzy Jakab or Yakab. I had a first cousin, Suzanna, that I was\nseeing from first grade on together. She was not there anymore. She was assigned to some other\njob. So anyway she became Suzy Jakab. And was represented a sister of mine and we really\nstayed together to the very end. Now the interesting thing it was, that for me to work outdoors,\nshoveling things, it's very difficult, I'm not physically strong. She was very strong physically so\nshe took over the heavy job. And the job she got that was a sort of like a railroad inside the big\nbarn looking thing that they were transporting items from one to the other. She taught me how to\nuse that particular machinery. It was something like a railroad. And you had a little, like a little\nchoo choo train to drive it. I drove it several times against the wall. That they didn't kill me for\nit I don't know, but anyway I did it. But what did she teach me to do, I never did in my life to\nsabotage the inside, what is inside. Two of us sometimes went in there breaking things and then\nreceiving the box __+ like it would have arrived, you know, it arrived broken.",
        "A: What do you mean how did you break them? If you smash a carton which has light bulbs in\nit, how does it break, okay, or if you puncture plastic bottles with some kind of chemicals, what\nhappens to it, all right? We took really big chances. We could have been hung for it.",
        "A: I don't know, because she encouraged me. And I think that somehow or other I felt that it's\ncoming to them. I mean they did, I mean they kill us without even I mean, we are not human\nbeings with them. They exterminating us. So what, so we do a bit of damage, too. I mean really\nit was my step sister so called that we cooperated, and somehow we got away with it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n 39",
        "A: It was either Stuffhof or Stoll or maybe both places. And that was before we even ever got\non the road to Riga.",
        "A: No, I don't know if anybody found out who did it, but that somebody did it. That's for sure.",
        "A: Well, we could have been hung for it easily or shot for it easily without any whatever. But\nsomehow it was a revenge.",
        "A: No, only between the two of us. It was our secret. I don't know. I mean it's unbelievable.\nFor instance for many, many years, many, many people ask, you know, did you tell your\nchildren? I said why should I darken their young ears with horror stories such as this? And I\nnever did. It was very difficult for me to even think about these things, nevertheless to talk to\nmy own kids or to my grandchildren. Sometimes my son asked about interesting stories. I said I\nmight have interesting stories, but it's not for the ears of children. Those are horror stories.\nThose are ghost stories. And I don't want to frighten them.",
        "A: Not too bad. Not too bad. We had those bunk beds, which I hate to this day. I wouldn't have\na bunk bed in my house or nothing. And all of my grandchildren do have bunk beds. And when I\nsee them, I say, honey, how can you put lovely grandchildren stack over stack. I mean all right,\nit saves beds, because the bedrooms are not and especially if you have five kids, you do need the\nspace, right?

We got a little bit of a report just\npassing by, but they were definitely on the other side. And we were on the other side so there\nwasn't, you know, just really straight contact. The one interesting thing it was for me that guy\nwas walking by and said, my, you must have been a beautiful child or a beautiful young girl.\nWell, I was still a young girl, but my head was shaved and I had no idea how I looked like. But\nanyway that was a compliment.",

It's an awful feeling\nseeing those Hebrew letters scattered and using for gravel for filling in roads or whatever. It's an\nawful feeling for the person who is doing it and you have to. There is just no two ways about it\nbecause those supervisors are standing over you and you have a certain assignment and you have\nto break up this much during your work day, and that's all there is to it. There is just no\nargument about it.",

And it dawned on me that is the moonlight\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n47\nsonata, Beethoven. And I can't hardly describe the feeling.

        "A: I don't know because Suzy tend that to me with all sorts of creams and whatever, hot cloth\nand washed it and, you know, to make it feel a little better.",
        "A: So I'd be able to stand up and line up the next morning.",
        "A: She tended to me practically all night to make me feel a little better. I was black and blue.",
        "A: So I mean that was an experience also.",
        "A: Then they brought us back, they brought us back, I don't know, we made a long, long march\ntowards one of the camps, but I can't quite remember the name.",
        "A: When we went back to Germany.",
        "A: Yes, we also came back on a boat from Riga.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n 19",
        "A: March to a new camp, but I don't remember",
        "A: Very difficult because many people fell out, and they were either shot or just left by the\nwayside.",
        "A: Apparently. I had lost one first cousin during that particular march, not her sister was next\nto her. But she fell out and they didn't let her help her up or anything. There was three sisters,\nand two of them made it and one didn't.",
        "A: Apparently. I'm here. I don't even know how or why or when.",
        "A: It must have been at least a week or more, at least. All I know is that somehow towards the\nend we wound up in the Saar region dancing, and that's where I was liberated by the Russian\nsoldiers.",
        "A: No, not really, not really. Only thing I know of that a number of people fell out and never\nmade it.",
        "A: We stopped somewhere, but I don't know where. It must have been a bunker or some kind of\na you know, they had bunkers.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n50",
        "A: Along the roads, you know those zigzag things.",
        "A: Yes, the trenches, that the Germans themselves used. My stepsister, Suzy, Suzy Jakab or\nJakabs, Suzy Jakab. She got shrapnel through her eye.",
        "A: No, that happened already when we arrived to the Saar region. We were dancing in one of\nthose bunkers, all right? The place where we arrived was heavily bunked by the Germans. And\nthey asked for five volunteer women to peel potatoes. And that was asked by German soldiers.\nAnd we decided what did we have to lose, at least we eat for a few days because whatever\nrations they gave, if you peel potatoes, we get the benefit ourselves. So we went potato peeling,\nfive of us. That was myself and my stepsister and three other women. And after about a week of\nthis treat, because really it was a treat because we ate, the soldiers said now you have to return to\nyour camp. And we thought surely the moment we going to turn our back, they are going to\nshoot us, but they didn't. They walked thataway and we walked thataway. And after a few\nminutes we looked back, we didn't see the German soldiers, we saw the bunker flocked down in\nthere. So there was a bombing. The Germans were bombing that Saar region. And my sister or\nstepsister got a shrapnel through her through her leg.",
        "A: I was next to her like even closer than I am to you right now. I didn't have a scratch. But\nanyway I ripped up something. I don't know whatever she wore or I wore to make a tourniquet,\nall right? And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the\nwar is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life. It was a hand rolled, hand\nrolled and hand cut tobacco. So anyway I never smoked. And I handed it to my stepsister who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n51\nwas actually in the underground, and she was a smoker already from the age of 16 or whatever,\nnot that it helped her because she wasn't paid. We didn't have anything. So after about a day or\nso ambulance came and took all five of us to a hospital. But three of the women were pretty\ngood looking, hefty looking were raped in front of my eyes.",
        "A: The other three, not me. I was like a walking skeleton and, of course, my stepsister was\ninjured with the tourniquet and the loss of blood so she was got away.",
        "A: Um?",
        "A: The Russian soldiers.",
        "A: Ina way, yes. But then again, I looked at myself, and I said who would want this walking\nskeleton even to touch. I mean I was just really skin and bones even though I was still young.",
        "A: No, I didn't for a whole year. I didn't for a whole year. I was convinced that there is\nsomething in the food which suppresses all that all that feminine action. I mean it's part of life.",
        "A: But the doctor convinced me that's not the case.",
        "A: Actually I became pregnant in August.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n52",
        "A: I was hoping it's true. And then I heard also horrible thing, which I heard. There were very\nfew people sort of half dead, half dead wandering around that camp. It's called Mashata (ph). It\njust occurred to me. Mashata (ph) _ +.",
        "A: Not really, however, the Germans did something horrible. There were few sort of half dead\nwandering around. It looked like that the whole camp was either + or diseased or, you know,\njust ready to be buried. The few alive people who were still alive transported on a boat and the\nboat was blown up so they all went down. They all went down. That's awful that the Germans\ndid that. Now, that's something which they they didn't gain by killing another 50 people or\nanother 25 people, but they did it.",
        "A: So actually what you want me to tell you, what do you want me to tell you?",
        "A: Nostach (ph).",
        "A: She was in the hospital, and it just so happened that the farmer's daughter died in the same\nroom where my stepsister was, Suzy. Okay? And I went to that farmer. I said I will be glad to\nwork for them if they let me visit my sister at least once a day or at least three times a week so I\nsee how she's getting along. So I was so I was with Polish farmer. They didn't even know I'm\nJewish. And I never advertised it because I didn't know. I didn't trust them.",
        "A: I still had the so I was a political prisoner.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n a3",
        "A: I took my star off, but I was a political prisoner.",
        "A: Sometime in the hospital most likely.",
        "A: All right? The number didn't make any difference because the political prisoners had\nnumbers also. And they were not that well educated. So anyway I went to see my sister, how\nshe's coming along, and she was sometimes on very high fever. And we were very, very\nconcerned, but she had a very strong constitution and she pulled through very good. And anyway\nI went and I was able to take a little meal again, a little cheese and a little sugar or whatever they\ngave me. God forbid that I should take 1t without asking. But I asked if I may take something\nfor my sister. And I was scrubbing the toilet for them and I was tending the whatever _ or\nfeeding these or whatever I was assigned to do. It didn't make any difference to me as long as I\nwas able to provide a little help for my helper. And slowly but surely she got a little better, but I\ngot very bad, and I was admitted to the hospital for a few weeks for better nourishment, and it\nwas middle of or end of July that finally",
        "A: The it must have been the",
        "A: Russians, yes. It definitely was. The Saar region was definitely occupied by the Russians,\nyes. And then I was admitted to the hospital for a little better nourishment to build up my\nstrength. And then finally we got our walking papers, and then it took a few kilometers, a very\nfew kilometers either by train or by bus or by whatever to get closer and closer because we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n54\nwanted to approach, again, my city, that if there is anything underway somebody will be\nregistered. And the first sign of registration I found in Budapest. That took a good two months.",
        "A: No, we had papers. We had papers, you know, so many kilometers. I mean there was\nalways Jewish communities who were helping people to get home and search for their relatives.",
        "A: Russian Jewish community.",
        "A: German, whoever community gave us papers for the rides.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I got to Budapest and that's where at first, I found that Imre Wollner is looking for Anna\nWollner. And, of course, I left my that Imre Wollner is looking for Anna Wollner.",
        "A: Well, I was very happy at least that I was married and we were in love and it was a\nwonderful feeling, that he's looking for me and I'm looking for him. But I found no trace of my\nparents nor of my brother, and that was a very sad thing. The interesting thing that when we met\nin my city, the first thing I said let's go home. I have a feeling there is nothing to look for and we\ncan find out later if there is anybody alive.",
        "A: Back to my town but we stayed there for\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n55",
        "A: No, he came out, I believe, another day or another day later. I don't know. It was something.\nBut anyway we had within a day or so we met.",
        "A: The same city where we got married, yes.",
        "A: Um?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: She was still with me and we lost contact only after we got in the United States.",
        "A: She was a big Communist. And actually her and my husband didn't get along at all. I mean\nlet's be honest about it. I would like to be honest about it. But I mean really we help each other.\nWe were just really like sisters.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We stayed.",
        "A: Yes.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n _",
        "A: Yes. As a matter of fact, he established with two of his friends, a business which they called\nimport/export _. And it went well. We did pretty good. And Peter was born. Peter was born.\nHe was one of the first in my city. He was born in April.",
        "A: We stayed until King Carl was exiled. I mean he had to leave the country, and then his son,\nMikial (ph) became king. And when he had to leave also, I said I'm not going to raise my son\nunder Stalin after Hitler. And that's when we decided that we leave and how did we leave? We\npaid a peasant to sneak us across the border to Hungary or a hay bagger. And the three of us\nwent to Hungary and then from Hungary to Austria and then from Austria to Munchen. And\nfrom Munchen, we requested the refugee porter to the United States, and it took us a year.\nArriving in the United States in '49, in '49.",
        "A: Well, he was born in '46.",
        "A: We left in '46. He was two years old. '49.",
        "A: The doctor gave him tranquilizer, but it didn't work. He was hollering all through the hay\nride and fell asleep after we got to the Hungarian side, but nothing happened, thank God. He's\nhere. He's here.",
        "A: We requested the quota. You know _ + had a refugee quarter so to be accepted as an\nintended United States citizen _ and we got it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n57",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Also on a boat, steerage.",
        "A: Yes. Arrived to Ellis island. Peter had the measles so we were quarantined. Then we got to\nNew York finally, and I said this is not the city I want to live in United States. And that's how\nwe got to Memphis, Tennessee. I wanted a leisure southern town, friendly so I heard, and it was\nlovely. I really liked Memphis, Tennessee. That's where my kids were educated. There was a\nvery lovely Jewish community. There was a Jewish school. It started with kindergarten, and\nthen it became a yeshiva, a high school for the girls. I mean it really turned out lovely.",
        "A: More or less I would call it self taught. I mean I practically lived in the libraries.",
        "A: Catching up things. And also I was accepted, which is a very unusual thing in the niklivi\n(ph) for arts and crafts for _+. I wanted to teach actually in Israel, but at the time that I have\nfinished the nikliv (ph), I would have been a certified teacher, I was close to 60. There is no way\nin the world that you can get a permanent job or __ at that age. There is no way. So I just gave\nup. Who needs a piece of paper if I cannot earn anything with it?",
        "A: Umhum.",
        "A: \u201878.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n ag",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Umhum.",
        "A: I left Tennessee in '78 to go to Israel. My three children were married already. And I had\nalready four grandchildren. And the rest of my grandchildren were born after I got to Israel.",
        "A: No, only me. I divorced my husband in '74.",
        "A: Four years before I went there.",
        "A: 1978 and I",
        "A: [had first cousins.",
        "A: Just I was recently called back by my children that I'm not well.",
        "A: __ Yom Kippur.",
        "A: In Israel. Well, I have been coming and going.",
        "A: Every year there is no grandchild that was born without me. And I have 13. God bless them.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n59",
        "A: [have three great grandchildren. I think I told you. Can we? Yes.",
        "A: I'm very proud to be Jewish. But then again on the other hand, I'm very proud to be Jewish.\nAnd I declare it especially here in the United States when they the people make completely\nuncalled for remarks, you know, jew you down or, you know, expressions such as that. So\nusually make the remark, the Jewish people usually are very fair and sincere, and they don't want\nto cheat people out of anything. As a matter of fact, you can rely on a Jewish person because\nholically (ph) or according to the law it's a sin to cheat. And anybody who's observant is going\nto respect that. There's another thing, which is very much observed that is in the ten\ncommandments to respect and honor your elders. That's a very important thing in the Jewish\nlaw. That's one of the dos instead of do nots. And I think that the almighty was very kind to us.\nThat was when we reach a certain age that we need protection and we need his protection. I\nthink it's wonderful.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, hardly. It's difficult. It hurt to talk about it. It hurts to talk about it. Now, what would I\nsay to a ten year old? And then he's going to look at the other young mothers, maybe they are\nyounger than Iam. I was 30 years old when George was born. And I was 37 when Teddi was\nborn, when my daughter was born. I was 37. She was born in 1960. That is seven years\ndifference between my children. It wasn't my choosing. It just happened so what can I tell a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n <0\nchild about my experiences? And then he's going to look at his best friend that he comes over to\nplay football with or hockey or just do homework together. And then he's going to say, what,\nyour mom I mean this is something, you know, you read not even in history I don't think. They\ndon't even have these things in history books or do they?",
        "A: For a long time I had been asking why me? Somehow I don't ask it anymore. I don't know\nwhy me. I mean really and truly so many so much better people perished. I feel, for instance,\nthat I always envied my brother who's younger than me that he's such he's so much better person\nas a human being than I am. Why not him and why me? Somehow or other I feel guilty about\nbeing alive and him not being alive or, for instance, the event that the war was over, and Hitler\ndoes not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun\nBrown, right? I asked dear God why did we deserve this? Why did you do this to us? What\nhave we done? I mean I'm not speaking only about our group? It happened in Poland. It was\nreally something. So I don't know. I mean I am asking a lot of questions, but I am asking less\nand less as the time goes by. I live to see a whole generation of new grandchildren that my two\nof my granddaughters are married. One of them already have three children. So I have great\ngrandchildren. So maybe there is a purpose in all of these I mean I have three I have a big\nfamily again and I came home alone. Alone with my husband, the two of us. It's not alone\nanymore. But I didn't even know when I was liberated by the Russians that I do have a husband\nhere that took several months to arrive to the particular to that particular moment.",
        "A: No, I never asked.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n61",
        "A: Because I don't want their money. Money doesn't it doesn't mean that much to me. There is\nnothing they could they could pay me a million, but my mother and father will not rise from\ntheir grave. My parents will always be there, and my brother is nonexistent. I've never asked for\nreparation. I don't want their money. It's very funny. I'm going to have fantastic expenses, and I\nknow that I don't even know if I'm going to survive this ordeal or not, but somehow I feel that I\ndid not leave in vain. And the reparation would make much different. Maybe it would make a\ngreat deal of difference for the children. Maybe I should because of them. But for me money\nhas no, no value in that particular thing. I have seen people selling houses, homes, fortunes,\nyachts for a crust of bread, really. I mean when it comes down to value, what is value? Life is\nvaluable. How you live your life is valuable, but not money. The money is not doesn't\nsomehow or other I am completely nonmaterialistic. Maybe, maybe it's foolish. And I should be\na little bit have a little bit more foresight, and the children are going to be burdened with my\nexpenses and whatever. But for myself, I don't want their money.",
        "A: Yes, to be proud of it. Just to be proud of the fact that they are they have an inheritance,\nthousands of years old, and be proud of it. It makes me very proud to see my oldest son sit down\nwith the two youngsters, the two ten year olds, Rosalee's son and his son are about the same age.\nAnd he's learning with them half an hour every evening, so he's transferring his knowledge, his\ndoctora with the young children and that's beautiful. To me, it gives a wonderful satisfaction.\nThat's value. To me, that's value. It's not the new outfits, and the new bicycles and pizza shops\nand God knows what, that's beside the point. But the inheritance, our history to be transferred to\nthe children, to teach them how to put the feeling on. To go through bar mitzvah. To be\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n =\nprepared he prepares them for the bar mitzvah. He doesn't hire another tutor. It's a wonderful\nthing. To me that means a great deal and so did my younger son, not to mention my daughter.\nThey became so religious. He's teaching in a yeshiva, and she's a__ now. And she's very, very\nrespected in the Jewish community in Brooklyn. And, listen, being in Brooklyn you have to be\nvery religious in order to fit in. And she is fitting in. As a matter of fact, she's a foster mother to\naretired _ besides her own five children. I mean I'm very proud of my kids.",
        "A: Well, I don't know. Ask me. Is there anything I need to add?",
        "A: Um?",
        "A: Well, the only thing is that there must be a purpose, only God knows what that I went\nthrough, and I'm here. It must be a purpose to it. It couldn't be just a coincidence because I think\nthat in our in the whole world, nothing just happens just by coincidence. Why this happened to\nus? Why exactly that particular community, 1t was hit so very hard, only God knows. But I'm\nsure it's not only question of money. We did have some rich people who were able to buy fake\npapers or went to Switzerland or whatever. Still somehow even they getting a certain tradition\nwith us with them. Don't you think? And they assured us or the survivor of certain amount of\npeople. It's could be it was their own family. It could be somebody outside the family, but I\nthink that it nevertheless saved a certain amount of people. So it was not in vain.",
