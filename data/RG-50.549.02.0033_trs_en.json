        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Hetty DeLeeuwe, conducted by Gary Covino, on January 13\",\n1999, in Highland Park, Illinois. This is a follow up interview to a United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview conducted with Hetty DeLeeuwe.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby\nHerr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, maybe\nwe could just start by having you say your name and where we are, maybe what the date\nis, what the weather\u2019s like outside.",
        "Answer: Well, today is the 13\" of January, in 1999, and we are here sitting in my kitchen,\nin Highland Park, Illinois and the weather is awful. It\u2019s snowing, and snow 1s piled up\nvery, very high, and it\u2019s wonderful to be inside and not have to suffer outside in the cold.\nAnd we are sitting here talking about what happened to my life after we were liberated,\nand I\u2019m ready to ask -- answer questions, I think.",
        "Q: Okay. Let me -- Let me ask you to go back. You did a video interview about your\nexperiences during the war --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- with the museum in Washington. But let\u2019s go back a bit and you\u2019ve talked about\nthis somewhat in that interview. Let\u2019s take it back maybe to a couple months before the\nend of the war. If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were,\nwhere you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time.",
        "A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish\narmy and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans. But I don\u2019t know\nmuch about that any more. The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely\nunder real war conditions. In September they started dropping the troops in Arnum, and\nsince I lived in Fenlow at that time, which isn\u2019t so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops\ncoming over in big airplanes, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and [ll\nnever forget it, because it was just immense. It -- It was never ending, big airplanes and\nlittle airplanes, which we later on found out were gliders, and that\u2019s really when our\nliberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire.\nAnd we -- we couldn\u2019t go outside any more and we didn\u2019t have gas and electricity and\nthings like that. And life became very, very difficult. I was still in hiding of course, and a\nfew very dangerous things happened to my personally. We had no food so my stepmother\nand her daughter went out to get food in the field, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and\nthings like that, cause the farmers couldn\u2019t get it, because the man didn\u2019t go outside, they\n-- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help\nthem in Germany, I guess. So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October,\nmaybe then already, that some Germans came to the house. I was there with my\nstepfather, who was in bed, because he was on strike. The Dutch government had told all\nthe people who worked for the railroad that they had to go on strike, so he did. And there\nwas a son in the house, who was supposed to be working for the Germans. So, he was\nalso somewhere hiding in the house, so I had to open the door. And the Germans said\nthey wanted to look in the house, and they looked in the house, and they decided the\nhouse was good. And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in\nour house for awhile. So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us. And they\nsometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my\nstepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn\u2019t used to doing the housework and\nall that sort of stuff, so I always went to bed early. So they never saw me. Course, they\nwere scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed.\nSo, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed\naway from the real fighting apparently. And then in December, we were finally liberated,\nbut that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people\nwho lived in our little town, and they had to all go across the River Maus, into Germany,\nand then up north, into the northern part of Holland. And they wanted all the regular\npeople out of town, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans\nand the British who were coming. So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers\nat all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went\ninto hiding. The man stayed somewhere, I don\u2019t know where, but we, the women, stayed\nin a bombed-out house, and there we stayed for a couple of days. There was some food,\nthere was water and that\u2019s where we were liberated. And it was, of course, still very, very\ndangerous, because the troops didn\u2019t cross the river, and it was constant bombarding and\ngrenade fire. So, we somehow crawled to our house, and then the British decided that\nthey didn\u2019t want us there, so we were evacuated to another town, and there we stayed til I\nthink the middle of April. In the meantime, Holland wasn\u2019t even liberated altogether, so\nwhile I was in the other town with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we\nwere free. My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name\nand my -- my father\u2019s name. And then the next day they ask me my mother\u2019s name, and\nso they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you\nnever talked about it and you never wrote that down. And they apparently gave that to a\nJewish organization who was trying to find all the children. And then they -- that\norganization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to Israel, but -- then\nPalestine, but I didn\u2019t want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow,\nwould find my parents back. I had no idea where they were. So, they -- they decided they\nwere going to keep me in the house for -- I don\u2019t know how long, maybe they would have\ntaken me forever. And then my father, who was hidden in Amsterdam first, but later on\nleft for northern Holland, somehow got himself involved in underground work. He was\nan artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the province where\nhe was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to England, so that\nwhen the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every house was, and where\nevery little obstacle would be. And then somehow he was caught by the Germans. They\ncame in the house to check something. He and the owner of the house were sent to prison\nbecause they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in. And thank\nGod my father didn\u2019t reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was\nJewish, so he spent a couple of months in jail. And had they known he was Jewish, they\nwould, of course, have killed him instantly. But he was liberated there. And as it was, the\ntroops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated. So, when my father\ncame out of prison, they somehow presented him with a list. And my maiden name is\nD\u2019 Ancona, D\u2019A, and when -- in Holland, it\u2019s -- the A counts as the main letter, so my\nname was on top, and my father found out that I was okay. But then the problem was he\nwas up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in Holland, especially\nin the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no roads,\nthere was no public transportation, no trains, no buses, nothing. So, since my father had\nworked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who\ngave him permission to travel. So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross\nthe rivers, and you know, on a bicycle without tires. And he came one day to -- to the\nhouse where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom. And well, he knocked on the\ndoor, and we didn\u2019t get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew\nright away it was my dad. And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the\nGermans and that she had gone away, that she was in the holding camp, Westerbork, and\nafter that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had\nsurvived.",
        "Q: Let me just go back for a second --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The place where you were at in the country --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- who were these people you were with, if your parents were still in Amsterdam, were\n-- who were you with?",
        "A: When I was in hiding?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we all went in hide -- in hiding at same time. I\nwas taken by an organization to the southern part of Holland, and to a family that I had\nnever met in my life, didn\u2019t know the people, and --",
        "Q: You say an organization, do you know the name of it, or who those people were?",
        "A: Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD. And the -- the\norganization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he\nhad helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans. When -\n- When you were picked up from your home in Amsterdam, small children were put in a -\n- sort of what -- what used to be a school, and the parents were across the street in what\nused to be a theater. And then, before they went on transport to Westerbork, and those\nchildren, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think,\nnurses, and people who took care of kids. And they went out for walks sometimes. And\nthe organization had made it their business to steal some of those children. So, every day\nwhen some of those kids were walked outside to get a little fresh air, -- and I\u2019m sure that\nit was prearranged with help inside, that certain children were going to be taken away. So\nthey had as many clothes on as possible. And then they walked at the end of the line,\ncause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young\npeople came and just stole them away. And how they organized getting rid of their papers\nand -- I have no idea. I guess that\u2019s known in -- in Holland how it went, but those\nchildren were just rescued. And I was still at home. I was one of the very, very last in\nAmsterdam, who lived in their own house and that was because we are Sephardic. My\nfather and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their\ncrazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were\ngoing to be descendants from Aranos, which most likely was true, and we were not really\nJews, we were Christians. So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared\nnon-Jews, not because they didn\u2019t want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to\nhave to go to the other side of the world. I don\u2019t know what -- what my parents knew\nabout what was waiting on the other side of the fence. I didn\u2019t know an awful lot, because\nas much as possible was kept away from me. But I knew, and everybody knew that, that\nit wasn\u2019t very good. So, we were in Holland; in Amsterdam still quote quote free, in\nOctober of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in Amsterdam walking\nthe streets. There was no school any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for\nJews any more. So, on the 16\" of October, my father decided that since we weren\u2019t\ndeclared non-Jews, we had to go. So, my father found this organization and they said they\nwould have a place for me. So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady\ncame to pick me up and she took me along to the station and there she handed me to a\nyoung man, and he took me on the train with another child that I never saw again, and we\ntraveled a long distance. We had to change the pla -- the train in the station and we took\nanother train. Then we finally came at the destined place and this young man said to me,\n\u201cWell, you just wait here.\u201d And he took the young man with him and came back maybe\nthree quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that\ntime that I had to wait at that station was like -- like a year. It was never ending, and here\nI was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old. I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware\nof the dangers. I had no name, I didn\u2019t know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and\nif they -- somebody had come up to me and said, \u201cWhere are you going, what are you\ndoing, are you waiting for somebody?\u201d I couldn\u2019t say anything. So, I was very, very\nscared. And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a bicycle, so I went\nwith him on the bicycle and he dropped me off at this family. And there I stayed for the\nrest of the year and -- and another year. And I was very, very different from my own\nhome. I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man\nwas working for the railroad, he repaired railroad cars. And they were fine people, there\u2019s\nnothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what\nthey were doing. And they were terrific. But 1t was an altogether different life than what I\nwas used to. They were going to church all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed\nevery day and I wasn\u2019t used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that\nthey wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my house,\nand so --",
        "Q: And these people were not Jewish, that you\u2019re with, or they are?",
        "A: No, no, no, they were Christians.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: They were Christians where I lived now. So, everything was different, and of course I\n-- | had just said goodbye to my parents, my father and my mother, and I knew very well\nthat that wasn\u2019t all that sure that I would ever going to see them again. So, at -- it was\nvery traumatic, and -- but I had to adjust, I had no choice.",
        "Q: When you -- When you were in this house, with these people that you\u2019d never met\nbefore and they\u2019re not from your background, and they\u2019re not from your religion or\nwhatever, but they -- did you realize at the ttme how much of a risk they were taking to --",
        "A: Oh, I knew that, yeah, hundred percent, yeah, I knew that if somebody was going to\ncome, that th-the man would most likely be killed, and the son, who was 16 or so at that\ntime, would have had a hard time, too, and maybe the whole family. You never knew\nwhat the Germans were going to do. But, no, they knew very well what they did, and\nafter the war, I asked them why did you do this? And then my stepmother told me that\nsomebody who was sent by one of the clergy in that town, came to their house and asked\nif they would take a child, a Jewish child. And she was willing to say yes right away, but\nshe thought it was prudent to ask her husband if he was thinking the same way. So, she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you have to wait til my husband comes home from work and I can tell you\ntonight.\u201d So, as it happened, their oldest daughter was going to leave home, and that is\nvery important because in those days, you couldn\u2019t buy beds, you couldn\u2019t buy linens,\nyou couldn\u2019t buy blankets, you couldn\u2019t buy anything, even if you had the money, it\nwasn\u2019t available, and so they could only take me if they had a spare bed. So when the\ndaughter left, I could take her place, so they told the man who came from the\nunderground, they could only have a girl, because I could stay with their other daughter\nin the same room. So that\u2019s how come I found this place, or they found the place for me.",
        "Q: And in this place, where these people who were, at first anyway, are strangers, and\nthey\u2019re [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was very strange.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you, what was it like to be there? How did you act, how did you\nfeel? Did you feel quickly like part of the family, did you kind of keep to yourself, how\ndid they react? You know, what was that like? That\u2019s a strange situation to be in.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s an awful situation to be in cause, number one, I was very\nnervous that I had left my parents, and that this -- this -- this whole town was -- was --\nyou know, it was so different from a big city, and everything in tha-that household was\ndifferent than -- than in my house, and I -- I was -- I\u2019m an only child, so I wasn\u2019t used to\nbrothers and sisters, and once I was settled a little bit, you know, they started to tease me\nand I wasn\u2019t used to that at all. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I\nwas old enough to realize that crying wasn\u2019t going to help. And I knew also that I had to\nbehave myself and that I couldn\u2019t be this spoiled brat and that I had to adjust, because if I\ndidn\u2019t do that, maybe the people wouldn\u2019t want to keep me, and where was I going to go\nthen? I had nowhere to go. And that is the -- an -- an awful feeling. If -- If they had put\nme out on the street, I wouldn\u2019t have had any place to go. I was far, far, far away from\neven non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I had no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had\nnothing. And I think that was the scariest part, that I had to really be as perfect as could\nbe, because I couldn\u2019t risk any problems in that house, so when they teased me I had to\ntake it and they didn\u2019t do that to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was\nnot. I couldn\u2019t go to school. The daughter went to a parochial school, but that was a long\nwalk and there was no transportation at that time any more either. So, they didn\u2019t want\nme to risk that big long walk to school. So I had to stay home and in the beginning I tried\nto do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn\u2019t there. So, my stepmother said,\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t get you in here to be my maid, but maybe it would be a good idea to help\nme once in awhile.\u201d So I -- I helped my stepmother with making the beds, and in those\ndays, everything was breaking, so we had to sew a lot and mend a lot and I\u2019m pretty\nhandy when it comes to that, so I helped and I liked that. And I loved to scrub, so I -- I\nlearned a lot. I learned a lot of things that my mother never would have taught me, and\nthat came in handy later, I think. So, I -- I had to do things during the day, cause I was\nbored stiff otherwise. And so my stepmother and I got along very well. When she went\nshopping, she sho -- most of the time took me along, cause she wouldn\u2019t let me home\nalone, and so we went shopping and -- but there wasn\u2019t much to shop, so we didn\u2019t do\nthat too much. And so that was the -- my daily job, to help and do as much as I could to --\nto not be a nuisance.",
        "Q: What were the names of these people?",
        "A: They are the Shumachers. No, they are not alive any more. My stepfather died years\nand years ago. My stepmother died a few years ago. And she had willed that -- she had\nasked her children that when she was going to be gone -- in Holland it\u2019s usually that they\nsend out cards that somebody has passed away and an ad goes in the newspaper and she\nhad asked the children if they would resent it that sh -- they also put my name in as a\ndaughter. So they didn\u2019t mind, and so when she died, we flew over for her funeral. And I\nhad to sit right in front in the church, and the pastor knew about it, he -- he mentioned\nwhat they had done for me, and that I was there, and that they really looked at me as their\ndaughter, even though I wasn\u2019t their -- their real daughter. But, they were very, very kind\nto me, and up to now, we are still friends with the children, and the daughter who is the\nyoungest, was my best friend, really, because we -- we were together all the time. I\u2019m\ngoing to see her next week. And the daughter who left home and made room for me, 1s\nvery, very ill and I\u2019m going to meet her next week, too. She\u2019s in a nursing home and I\u2019m\ngoing to say hello to her, too, of course.",
        "Q: This is over there, or --",
        "A: That\u2019s in The Netherlands, that\u2019s in Holland, yeah.",
        "Q: What were their first names, this family?",
        "A: He was Johann and she was Aleida and then they had three children, Cynthia, Bowker\nand Yozeem. And the parents are honored in the Holocaust museum and they are\nmentioned on the wall upstairs as Righteous Gentiles, and they are mentioned in Yad\nVashem. I never get -- they got there, a big medal at one time, presented by Yad Vashem,\nas being Righteous Gentiles, and having saved my life. So, after the war, when we were\nliberated, and my father had come to my house where I was hidden, he -- he took me\nalong up north, where he had been living all that time, because we really didn\u2019t know\nwhat we were going to do. And there was a lot of food in the north, and where we were,\nthere was not so much. So my father took me along and after maybe two or three weeks,\nwe got a telephone call from Amsterdam, that somehow, miraculously, my mother had\nappeared. She had traveled for weeks, coming back from Austria, but she had arrived in\nAmsterdam and was looking for us. So, then my father and I went back to Amsterdam on\na milk truck. And my mother was like unreal. She was skinny and she used to be pretty\nwell rounded and she looked scary, and like a witch, sort of. And I was -- I was really\nscared of her. But, a-after a couple of days that -- I got used to it. Now, we didn\u2019t have a\nhouse at that time. She came to her brother\u2019s house, and so we were there, too, and --",
        "Q: You say your mother arrived --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- suddenly --",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nHetty DeLeeuwe. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: Scary and like a witch, sort of, and I was -- I was really scared of her, but after a\ncouple of days that -- I got used to it. Now, we didn\u2019t have a house at that time, she came\nto her brother\u2019s house, and so we were there too, and --",
        "Q: You say your mother arrived --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- suddenly --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Up until that point, before she showed up, what did you and your father think had\nhappened? Di-Did you have any knowledge that she was still alive?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you think that she did not survived?",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t think she had survived.",
        "Q: So you thought she was dead?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And then she appears?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s an astounding experience. What -- What was that like?",
        "A: Unreal, unreal. We -- We -- We didn\u2019t know where my mother had gone. We knew\nmy mother was caught at the place where she was in hiding, and after jail and I don\u2019t\nknow what else, she ended up in -- in Westerbork, in that camp before you go to -- to\nGermany or Poland. And since we had had this stamp in our papers, that we were most\nlikely not Jewish, and merranos and all that sort of stuff, which was like an exemption,\nmy mother had had that in her papers and the Germans didn\u2019t first want to recognize that,\nbut when she was in that camp, with the help of friends who lived there for quite awhile,\nthey recognized that. So, my mother was sent to Theresienstadt, and that was sort of the\nshow camp for the Germans. And that -- My father knew that she had been sent to\nTheresienstadt. But we also knew, after the war, that not everybody stayed in\nTheresienstadt, and so for the rest, we had no knowledge of what had happened to my\nmother. My -- My mother came back, though, she told us what had happened, and she did\nthe rounds. She stayed in -- She was caught in July of \u201944, which most likely is why she\nwas still alive, because it was sort of at the end of the war. She -- She went from\nTheresienstadt to Auschwitz, and there she stayed for about two weeks. And she didn\u2019t\ntalk much about that, but when she did talk about it, she said it was hell, and it was worse\nthan hell. They sort of stayed together, 10 Dutch women, and what was the best thing in\nAuschwitz was that if there was a transport to go somewhere else, cause nothing could be\nworse than Auschwitz. So, one evening, all the people who knew about that there was a\ntransport going, were lining up outside somewhere. And another story goes that\neverybody who is up front ends up going on transport, and the ones who are left over are\ngoing to be killed, that they knew. However, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so\nwhen all those women are fighting and -- and -- and -- and being excited about going\naway from Auschwitz, were standing 1n line, they let them turn around, so the ones who\nwere standing in front were standing 1n the back and the ones who standing in back were\nstanding up front. That saved my mother\u2019s life, because my mother otherwise would have\nbeen in the back, instead of in the front. Then she was transported to Lanzing, which was\n-- I guess nobody knows about that concentration camp. It was part of Mauthausen, in\nAustria. And there she had to work in a factory where they made rayon for parachutes.\nVery poisonous. People who work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food, have\nto drink a lot of milk, can\u2019t do it more than so many months, I guess, in a year, and there\nare strict rules, but for Jewish women that wasn\u2019t important, so they didn\u2019t get fed, and\nthey had to work very hard. They burned their skin and they were nauseous and sick\nsometimes, because all the poisonous gases and whatever. They -- My mother was fluent\nin German, and that sort of helped them, too, I think. My mother was -- I don\u2019t know ab -\n- if she was -- ca -- you can say she was a boss, but she was a teacher and so she knew\nhow to be ahead of the group, and so she told the Germans off whenever she could. And\nthey sabotaged a lot, too, cause if you put your finger on those instruments, then the\nwhole thing messed up, and they ruined I don\u2019t know how much. And so they were good\nat that. And somehow my mother survived, even though she got very, very ill there. They\noperated on her without any anesthesia, any -- any medicine, nothing. And even though\nthe German doctor who did it wanted to kill her, I\u2019m sure, he saved her life, because if he\nhadn\u2019t done that, I\u2019m sure she would have died. So, by the time she was liberated, she\nwas very, very ill, but the Americans took enormous good care of them. They sent them\nto hospitals, they had them x-rayed. Everybody who had TB was sent to a sanitoritum, and\nthe -- the medical staff of, I guess the military, took care of the prisoners. They stumbled\non this group of women. Now, my mother was with those 10 -- of which one had passed\naway, but there were also lots of Hungarian women in that group, and I don\u2019t know\nwhere those americ -- the -- where those Americans really took them. My mother talked\nabout flying to, I think southern Germany, and from there they were transported through\nSwitzerland, to France, and there they stayed for awhile, and then they came to Holland.\nBut you have a -- imagine that there was absolutely no normal transportation. Railroads\nwere bombed, and so it was very hard to get a train together and th-there wa -- there was\nno infrastructure whatsoever, so there was no mail. My mother wrote every day and we\nnever got those letters, until months and months later, after she had arrived. And then\nwhen we all three were back in Amsterdam, we didn\u2019t really know what to do. Our\nbusiness was dismantled, all our belongings were taken away. And somehow my father\nstarted again. He -- He got some help, I think, from the Marshall fund. That -- That\nwasn\u2019t something that they gave you, ee -- it was like loans. And in the same house\nwhere we used to live, we came back. But we had no furniture, we had no beds, we had\nno clothes, and --",
        "Q: Your house was still there? Other people hadn\u2019t --",
        "A: Well, it was -- but --",
        "Q: -- taken it, or --",
        "A: -- n-no, other people had lived in our house, but the Germans had taken everything\naway. Practically everything was gone and s -- a few -- very, very few things were hidden\nwith friends, and we got that back, but sometimes you didn\u2019t get that back either, cause\npeople were used to having it and they didn\u2019t want to give it back. But we basically were\nhomeless and -- and penniless. And my father was in his 40\u2019s, in his late 40\u2019s, and he had\nto start all over again, which he did, but it was so difficult, because your support was\ngone. Everything that -- that used to be n-normal ju -- before the war, and during the vi --\nfirst year, maybe, of the war, was gone. My grandparents were gone. All my uncles and\naunts were gone, all my cousins were gone, all my friends were gone. My parents friends\nwere gone. You -- You had nowhere to go. That what -- was very lonely existence. And\nnow, after 50-plus years, you -- you wonder how we did it. We didn\u2019t talk about what we\nhad lost, we didn\u2019t talk about how terrible it was. It was something that wasn\u2019t talked\nabout and you just sort of try to make the best of everything. And my mother was sort of\nnot normal when she first came back. She -- And she never was going to get to dress\ndecent any more, who needed it, and who wanted to wear stockings, hose. or things like\nthat, th-that wasn\u2019t necessary. But after maybe half a year, she was sort of the old\nmommy again, and --",
        "Q: What do -- What do you think was going on? Do you think maybe she was depressed?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know, my mother wasn\u2019t depressed. No, she -- she was stronger than that.\nNo, she had had typhus in -- in the camps, and I guess she was just so undernourished and\nso -- had been so sick that it took a long time to recover from that. And they had suffered\nso much, of course, and she never talked about much, cause I\u2019ve a-asked my children\nabout what did Omar ever tell you, and she never talked about camps with them. She\nnever talked about the war, but we never talked about we missed this person, or how sad\nthe way our family came to their end. It -- It was just a subject that wasn\u2019t touched. And I\nguess that it took many, many, many, many years before anybody could talk about it, and\nrealized that we all buried that inside us.",
        "Q: Why -- Why do you think you all did that? Why did you not talk about it, why did you\nkeep it inside? What do you think?",
        "A: It was -- It wa -- wa -- It was too awesome, it was too -- too big a problem. I don\u2019t\nthink anybody could understand it, how it could have happened, why it happened. It wit -\n- It was so unreal, it was something that nobody wanted to -- to understand, and I think\nthat basically -- I\u2019m not a psychologist, but I think that basically, everybody felt guilty\nthat the -- the few that -- of us who did survive, did survive. And I still have that myself,\ntoo. I so many times ask myself, why did I survive and not my very best friend, or m-my\nvery dear cousin? It -- It -- It\u2019s such a terrible thing that happened, that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you --\nyou can\u2019t explain it. And so I think it was so painful, and it hurted so much, that we just\nfigured, don\u2019t talk about it, and maybe it goes away. The truth ath -- is that with the years,\nI think the -- the pain never goes away and you keep on missing those people. I -- I -- \u2019'm\nfixated with my grandmother, and I was a kid when she died, and I -- I have -- I\u2019ve -- I\ntalk to her in my mind, and I -- I can see her still in her house, in my mind. And I -- I -- I\njust have problems sometimes with why, why did all those people have to be killed? They\nwere all honest, hard working, were not in anybody\u2019s way and they were just regular\ncitizens like the rest, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s some th -- very, very troublesome part of a life, and it\n-- | don\u2019t think it will ever go away. I mean, I live a very comfortable life now, and I have\n-- thank God I have -- I have a family, but that pain will never go away, that always\ncomes back somehow. And, if you live in a -- in a society like we are living here, you\nrealize what you\u2019re missing, too, because people have like school gatherings, you know,\nthey have reunions of their school. And -- And they have family affairs and you see 40 -\n50 - 60 people coming, maybe even more, and I have nobody. I have a cousin in Toronto,\nand that\u2019s my closest relative. And all my uncles, all my aunts, my cousins, they\u2019re all\ngone. And maybe they were not my best friends, but that -- that part of your life is so\nempty. And you don\u2019t realize it every second of the day, but you know it\u2019s there. And if\nthere are happy occasions in your family, you can\u2019t share it with relatives. Now, thank\nGod, we have good friends here, but it\u2019s still different than your own family.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How do you feel about what -- it\u2019s sort of two questions in one, how do you\nfeel about Germany and Germans? And how do you feel about -- I mean, you had one\nparticular experience, how do you feel about the people from your own country, from --\npeople from The Netherlands, not the Jews, but the other people, and how they behaved?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a tough one. I prefer not to go to s -- Germany. I -- I can\u2019t hold it against\nyoung people, or people my own age for that matter, so most of the Germans who did\nwhat they did, are not around any more. However, when I see or meet a German, I can\nthink in the back of my mind, maybe your grandfather or your father did to my\ngrandparents or my uncles and aunts, which is the unthinkable, but they did it. And I\ncan\u2019t hold it against anybody, but I\u2019m not very comfortable with Germans, I have to be\nreally honest. I wouldn\u2019t drive in a -- in a Mercedes. I -- I would think of a staff car,\nespecially when it\u2019s black, I would think, \u201cOh, that\u2019s the SS.\u201d Or the [indecipherable]\npolici. A crazy thing, I cannot have a Krupp coffee maker or a Krupp any machine in my\nhouse. I have a Brown coffeemaker, also comes from Germany, but it doesn\u2019t have the\nsame connotation as Krupp. Krupp is a bad word in my imagination, so I don\u2019t want to\nsee it in my house, I can\u2019t stand that.",
        "Q: Because of all the war industries?",
        "A: Of all the war, and -- and -- and -- and what they did to us. About the Dutch, I don\u2019t\nthink I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch, as about the Germans, but I know now that the\nDutch, as a whole, could have done a lot more, including our queen. Queen Wilhemina\nnever talked about anything, not on the -- on the English radio, about stand up against the\nGermans, try to help your Jewish neighbors. Never, ever that that came about, and they\nturned to her, then they thought, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too dangerous to help the Jews.\u201d I mean, I\nwas too young to realize all those things maybe then, but when you think about it, when\nyou\u2019re a grown-up and an adult, you wonder why not more people had tried to help. On\nthe other hand, I know that it was extremely dangerous, because Jewish doctors only\ncould t-take care of Jewish patients and non -Jewish doctors couldn\u2019t take care of non-\nJewish -- of Jewish patients. Everything was segregated and we had never had that in\nHolland. Holland was a very liberal country. As a matter of fact, my ancestors came to\nHolland after the Inquisition, and Holland welcomed them. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It -- It\u2019s very\nhard to -- to really judge and to say, well they could have saved more, because everybody\nknew that if they did help Jews, they would be punished like Jews. On the other hand, if\nlots of people would have stuck together, maybe they would have been able to\naccomplish more. In Belgium they did a lot more for the Jews than they did in Holland.\nAnd it\u2019s -- it -- it -- it sh -- true it wasn\u2019t publicized, I mean, so most of the Jews lived in\nthe big cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, maybe The Hague, and in some s -- all over the\ncountry. And the -- the population in -- in the smaller towns, might not have known\nexactly what happened to the Jews, but the masses in -- in the big cities, did know. They\nsaw it. | mean, part of Amsterdam was cordoned off and nobody could move, and they\nwent house to house and house, an-and picked up the Jews. And 1-it was -- it was a very\ndifficult thing. I can\u2019t blame them hundred percent because I know how dangerous it was\nto help Jews. On the other hand, you would have liked to had a little more help from the\nmasses. And they did it once when they had the strike, when the first Jewish young\npeople were picked up, they had a strike in Amsterdam, all the municipal workers\nstopped working and it was a mass demonstration that day, and there was is a monument,\n[indecipherable] dock worker in Amsterdam, to remind us of that. And that was fantastic,\nbut it was one day, and then they went back to work, and the Germans went back to pick\nup Jews. So, it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t say that I -- I -- I hated the Dutch people for it, but in hindsight,\nyou could say they could have done a little more for us.",
        "Q: But I take it, for instance, if you bought a Philip\u2019s VCR or something, that you don\u2019t\nban Dutch products from the house, the way you might some German products?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: You were, you know, a -- a younger woman during the war when all this happened.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: What -- When did you first hear about and what was your reaction when say, Anne\nFrank\u2019s diary was published?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I read it for many, many years, and | ha -- I don\u2019t think I have read it all\ntogether. I -- I -- ve seen it and I\u2019ve taken a few pages here and there.",
        "Q: Did you know about it when it was first published, or later?",
        "A: Yeah, I guess so, yeah, I guess so. And there\u2019s a lot of controversy about it now,\nunbelievable. I think it was a beautiful thing, because it gave the world insight of what\nhappened to us, and how -- how people who absolutely had nothing wrong done, were\nconvicted and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and persecuted. And it give the -- the world an\ninsight of what -- what it was all about. But, still I don\u2019t think the -- the -- the pain that\ncame afterwards comes out of that, because that\u2019s not what she experienced. She was one\nor two years older than I was, and I knew her, because she lived 1n a neighborhood where\nI used to live, and I had a friend there, so I -- I knew her so ve-ve-very -- very casual.\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Oh, so you actually knew her personally?",
        "A: Yeah, well -- well very casual, I mean, if y -- 1f you would -- I -- I -- I know she lived\nthere and we played outside once, or twice maybe, you know. You know, all those little\nkids there in the neighborhood. But, you know, she was a very nice kid, but very\nintelligent that she could write about it the way she did. I was not able to do that in those\nyears, I wasn\u2019t that -- that verbal and I wasn\u2019t good at writing, or anything.",
        "Q: Had you known at all, at the time or later, right after the war, what had happened with\nher family, how they had hid, and how most of them had not survived or whatever, or di -\n- di -- they -- or they weren\u2019t familiar enough to you that you would even have known\nabout it?",
        "A: The Franks, you mean?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No. No, no, I don\u2019t know. You know, you were all too much involved with your own\nproblems, that I-I didn\u2019t know the family or anything like that. You know, you were so\ninvolved with -- and the very few people who were there, and who needed support, and\nwho were your support, people that -- that you didn\u2019t know about, or were -- that -- that\ndidn\u2019t come up in our lives, you know. Our lives were tough because we had -- we had to\nwork so hard to get back to -- to where we were before. And I think about it, I have the\ngreatest admiration for my father, who somehow managed to get a factory back to work,\nand make some money. And, I mean, we had a house again and later on, we had -- with\neverything we needed again. It\u2019s amazing how it -- it all came back. And what was very\npainful after the war was that some people left money and -- and belongings and there\nwere big fights in families on who got what, and nobody had a will, cause you didn\u2019t\nthink of things like that. So you inherited from the strangest people and from your closest\nrelatives, you sometimes didn\u2019t inherit. And then the -- the government took enormous\namounts of money as taxes of those inheritance. We had people who had valuables were -\n- and who came back after the war, tried to get their valuables back from friends, or from\na-acquaintances, and people just didn\u2019t want to give it back, they said, \u201cOh no, that was\nmine.\u201d And they were so used to having those things that they didn\u2019t want to give it back.\nTh-The -- The strangest situations arose, that made it hard to get friendly with people that\nyou used to be friendly with. What was it -- it was a strange, empty life, right after the\nwar, and it took years to sort of come back to a normal life. For instance, I had gone to --\nI\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve had -- finished elementary school, and I -- I was supposed to go to some sort\nof a high school, but I did that for one year, but that year was so strange, because people\nwere not showing up the next day, teachers weren\u2019t showing up the next day. You know,\nthere was always somebody who was taken away by the Germans, so the school was not\na normal school year. And so when I went back after the war, I went for three years to\nhigh school, and then I just quit, because I just couldn\u2019t stand it, I was in the meantime\nthis grown-up -- I had gone through so much that I wasn\u2019t this 15 year old kid when I\ncame out of the war. I -- I -- I just didn\u2019t have the patience to sit in class an-and study. So,\nafter three years I quit and I went to work. And I helped my father in his business.",
        "Q: What was his business?",
        "A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufactured like sportswear, things like that. And\nI-I worked in the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nHetty DeLeeuwe. This is tape number two, side A.",
        "A: -- patience to sit in class an-and study. So, after three years I quit and I went to work.\nAnd I helped my father in his business.",
        "Q: What was his business?",
        "A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufactured like sportswear, things like that. And\nI-I worked in the office and I worked in the factory, too. That was better for me, I think.\nSchool was just not challenging enough at that time, I -- I didn\u2019t have the -- the brains to -\n- to put myself to work, and my mother would have loved to see me go to college, but --\nwas big disappointment, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I was better off doing something with my\nhands and keeping my mind occupied that way. And so I worked for many, many years,\nand for -- later on my father sold the business, cause he was sick, and so then I had a\nregular job. And I lived in Holland til I was 31, and then I married and came to the\nUnited States.",
        "Q: How did you meet him?",
        "A: How I met my husband? My husband 1s originally also from Holland, and that family\nwas very lucky, they made it just in time out of Holland before the war. I guess they were\non the boat when the war broke out, or something that close. And so my husband, as a\nsmall child, was growing up in the United States. After the war, the family went back to\nHolland, because they used to have businesses there, and my father-in-law wanted to see\nwhat he could salvage. So they stayed in Holland. But having grown up in the United\nStates and then coming back to Holland in a small town, being my husband was very st --\nrather observant, it was sort of an impossible task. So, he came back to the United States\nwhen he was 18, and then he ended up in the service, during Korea. He ended up serving\nin Morocco and when he was discharged, they asked him to stay on, and he worked in\nWeisbaden, Germany. And that way he came home once in awhile. So that\u2019s how we\nmet, because they lived sort of around the corner. And then we married, and he lived in\nthe United States, but we married in Holland and then I came with him here.",
        "Q: Where did you come to? What -- What --",
        "A: We started out in New York City, and we lived on Long Island and then he was\ntransferred to Washington area, and we lived between Washington and Baltimore. And\nthen we got transferred to Chicago, and that\u2019s where we are now.",
        "Q: How did you feel about coming to the United States and leaving Holland? Were y --\nWere you happy about it? Did you want to get out of there, or were -- were you sad --",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. I -- I felt bad that I left my parents and I never realized\nhow hard it was for them that their only child was leaving. I really never thought of that.\nBut I was happy, I was marrying a very nice guy, and I had never wanted to go to the\nUnited States, it never was any attraction to me. But I had no choice, it was either\nmarrying my -- my lover and go with him to the United States, or not marry. And so I\nchose the United States and my husband. And I\u2019m not sorry. I love it here. I don\u2019t think I\nwould s -- go back to Europe. I love Europe, I love to travel there, love the culture and I\nthink you miss that in the United States. But -- The old buildings and all that sort of stuff.\nBut, I don\u2019t think I could settle in Holland any more.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s painful. I ha -- My parents passed away in the meantime, too. So, I have my\nmother-in-law, my sister-in-law and her family, and that\u2019s all very well, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nempty for me there. And here I have good friends, and my kids.",
        "Q: When you came over, you didn\u2019t have any children at that point?",
        "A: No, no, no, I was just married.",
        "Q: Yeah. How many children do you have? When did you have them?",
        "A: I have two sons, I have two sons and one lives, thank God, 1n Chicago. The other one,\nfor the time being, lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil. So, that\u2019s far. But we -- we have travel\nprivileges at United Airlines, because my husband used to be pilot. So we travel easy and\nhe can come home once in awhile. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s far, but 1t\u2019s not that far that it\u2019s unreachable.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What are your son\u2019s names? How old are they?",
        "A: One, the youngest is David, he\u2019s 34. And Isaac, he\u2019s 35, the oldest. And sadly enough,\nthey\u2019re both single, but that\u2019s something I can\u2019t do anything about any more.",
        "Q: Any eligible --",
        "A: They know I would love -- I would love them -- to seem -- see them married, but there\ncomes a time that a mother has to keep her mouth shut.",
        "Q: If any eligible women are listening, do you want to drop their phone numbers onto the\ntape at this point?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, it\u2019s their business, you know, I can\u2019t mingle in any\nmore.",
        "Q: Did you, when you came to the United States, did -- did you work, did you stay at\nhome?",
        "A: No, I stayed home. I was 31 when I married, I was 32 when I had my first ca -- child\nand we decided that it was better for me to stay home and raise the kids. And in those\nyears, it might have been nice if we had had a little extra, but over the years, being an\nairline pilot, we -- we had a decent income, and it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to -- to go to\nwork, so I was a stay home mom. But I did always do something, volunteer work, so --\nand I\u2019m still involved in that.",
        "Q: What about your children and you, and your experiences during the war? Did you --\nWhen they were younger, did you talk about it much with them? How did you handle\nthat? You know, you said your -- your family back in Holland, basically, you didn\u2019t talk\nabout it.",
        "A: No, my mother didn\u2019t talk about it. No, the kids know that I was hidden, and they\nknow about th-the family that I was with, and they know some of them. And they have\nvisited, too, there. When they were in Holland, I took them along there, and they visited.\nNot too many times, but we did go there. And --",
        "Q: You went where?",
        "A: To Holland to visit my step-parents.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: They -- They knew about it, and somehow they, over the years have told me that I am\nOo -- too overprotective, because -- and they -- they blame that on the sort of holding onto\nthem, and it\u2019s a result of the war that I am the way I am. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. They\nalways say, well Jewish mothers are always overprotective. I don\u2019t think that is true, I\nthink that all mothers are protective of their children if they\u2019re normal mothers. But, I\u2019m\nalways happy when I know they\u2019re coming, that they\u2019re home and worried that -- I think\nI wor -- I worry -- I -- I worry that th-they got an accident, or that something happens to\nthem, and I\u2019m always happy when they\u2019re home and then they\u2019re safe around. But they\nknow my story and -- and they know how difficult it was. And they missed too, the par --\nth-the -- the family. They -- They have no extended family, as such. So, they -- they --\nthey know what -- what the war did to them, too. It\u2019s -- They have three cousins in\nHolland, my sister-in-law has three daughters, but that\u2019s all they have. And they have this\none uncle and this one aunt, and there is nothing else, you know, that comes after that. So\nthey too, feel the -- the pain of not having a big family, like other people around here.",
        "Q: Did they get to know their grandparents very well?",
        "A: Well, they -- my -- my father and my father-in-law -- my father-in-law passed away\nbefore we were married, my father-in-law -- my father died right after we were married,\nso they never knew their grandfathers, but my mother came regularly and my mother-in-\nlaw, too, so they know their -- they knew my mother very well, they had a good\nrelationship with her, and they have a very good relationship with my mother-in-law. My\nson from Brazil calls her like every other week, and -- and they -- they value that very\nmuch, yeah.",
        "Q: Your mother had a -- a horrible experience during the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did they talk much with her about that?",
        "A: No, no, she didn\u2019t talk about that, no.",
        "Q: Did they ever ask and she refuse, or what? It just didn\u2019t come up?",
        "A: In -- I don\u2019t think they ever asked and she never talked about it. She never talked\nabout it. The only thing [indecipherable] that she was in Auschwitz in October, and when\nmy father had passed away, she came regularly here in the winter, because those long\nnights and those lonely days, especially in October, she didn\u2019t want to be alone because\napparently she always re-lived the horror of those days in Auschwitz, and -- and she liked\nto be here with us. She didn\u2019t talk about it, but I know that\u2019s why she wanted to be away.\nNo, she never -- she never mentioned it, she -- she was very close, though, with all those\nwomen who were with her in the concentration camps, and all of them, exe -- except one,\nI think, have passed away. But they were all like sisters, like good support for each other.\nThey -- They understood each other, and they -- without talking about it, they -- they\nknew what was going on in their minds, I think. They -- They needed each other very\nbadly. And they were very, very close bunch, all those years. But no, my mother didn\u2019t\nsay much about it and I guess the kids never thought of asking. Maybe they didn\u2019t dare, I\ndon\u2019t know. Never came up.",
        "Q: What about when things happen, which they do occasionally, things come up in the\npress, things come up in the media, things come up in the movies. There\u2019s a new\ndocumentary, a movie like \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d is made, things like that happen.",
        "A: I\u2019ve seen that. I basically don\u2019t go to war movies, I don\u2019t go to -- I don\u2019t read books on\nthe Holocaust. I hate real war movies, like shooting and things like that. My kids never\nhad guns. I\u2019m very much against war, because I lived through it and it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s so scary,\nit\u2019s so horrendous. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve seen the last movie, \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d which has mixed\nreactions from some people, and I know the Holocaust is not to make fun of, but I\nthought the movie was very sensitive about what happened, it -- I feel it\u2019s like -- like a\nlittle -- not a fairy tale, what\u2019s the right word? A fable, you know. How it starts early in\nthat life of the man and the woman, that they -- they fall in love and they have a good life,\ngood family life. They have a cute little kid, and already the anti-Semitism comes in with\nthe mother, and then in the war -- of course, in the concentration camp it wasn\u2019t that way\nit is depicted in -- in this movie, but the love of the father to protect his child, 1s -- 1s -- 1s\nso beautiful. I think that the film 1s really very, very special. And I went there by mistake,\nbecause if I had known it was all about the Holocaust, I wouldn\u2019t have gone. But I -- I\nwasn\u2019t sorry I saw it. And I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d And the -- I never saw \u201cShoah.\u201d And\nI don\u2019t want to see movies on -- on -- on the Holocaust, on th-the -- the camps and things\nlike that. I\u2019ve been to the Holocaust Museum, few times. But I find that difficult. I find it\nvery difficult. It\u2019s when you see all those mass of shoes, I think, \u201cOh maybe the -- my --\nmy -- my uncle\u2019s shoes are in there,\u201d or my whatever. All those pictures. It\u2019s something\nthat will never leave us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I know most of those people that I mourn all the time, wouldn\u2019t have been here\nany more, you know. By this time, most of them would have been gone. My p -- My\ngrandparents for sure. But it -- it was -- you can\u2019t realize that -- that all those people were\nmurdered, for what? Just because you\u2019re Jewish? And as I say, my parents were atheists.\nThey didn\u2019t do anything about being Jewish, religiously, that is, for sure. And -- But\nHitler didn\u2019t care. Hitler didn\u2019t care.",
        "Q: How about you and your husband, are you religious at all? Are you like your parents,\nor --",
        "A: Well, my husband came from an o-observant home, and I learned, in my hiding days,\nabout religion. And so, after the war, I guess I made up my mind that I -- I wanted to\nmarry Jewish, because I thought -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but that was in my mind, that\nsomebody who was Jewish, could understand better what went through in my head once\nin awhile. And so that was a hard thing, because most of the people in my age group, in\nHolland, were gone. Were very few eligible men. So, it took me awhile to -- to find the\nright one, or the right one to find me. And so, since his mother is observant, I decided that\nit was prudent to start out with a kosher home. And then we, somehow, when the kids\ngrew up, we got more observant, and my husband 1s very observant, I am a little less\nobservant. But we keep a kosher home, and we keep all the holidays. And the kids are not\nthat observant. We tried to teach them, and it\u2019s up to them now. They went to parochial\nschool, here in Chicago. At least they had a good Jewish education, and they know what\nthey don\u2019t want to know when they know what it\u2019s all about. And we -- we tried to be an\nexample. But it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to be very religious when I know some people all\ntogether forgot about religion after the war, others went just to religion to get strength in\nlife. There are always so many questions that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard, 1t\u2019s hard to believe\nthat everything just was for some reason. I can\u2019t de -- I can\u2019t deal with that. I th -- I can\u2019t\nbelieve that was God\u2019s plan. But who am I to know?",
        "Q: Do you feel like you have found any answer, or it\u2019s just one big question?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t find an answer. No, how can you find an answer to this? I mean, it\u2019s\nterrible when -- when -- when some person shoots one person for one reason or another,\nfor hatred, for -- for jealousy, for whatever. And -- But -- But how can you murder so\nmany people? I mean, it\u2019s not just the 6,000,000 Jews, there were 6,000,000 other people\nalso killed, homosexuals and Gypsies, and whatever. People that were not hundred\npercent the way Hitler wanted them to look. When you were born with some defect, you\nwere destined to go. That\u2019s not life, that\u2019s not right. No, I haven\u2019t found an answer to\nthat. I never will find an answer.",
        "Q: How often these days do you think you think about it, does anything pop into your\nhead or you have thoughts about it? Is it often, hardly ever?",
        "A: Oh, no, not hardly ever. There is always a day, you know, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s now January,\nso on the seventh of January, my very best friend had her birthday. She was just a f-few\nmonths older than I am. And now of course, I write down seventh of dec -- of January,\nand I say, \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s Yute\u2019s birthday,\u201d and the mil --",
        "Q: You talked about her in your video interview.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there are things that just happen, you know, that you think of somebody. No, it --\nit -- 1t\u2019s not daily, but it\u2019s always there, in the back of your mind. But it\u2019s also because\nhere people have so much family, especially in Chicago. When we lived in Baltimore, in\n-- in -- in Columbia, Maryland we lived, everybody was imported from somewhere. It\nwas a new city and everybody was from somewhere. So nobody had the whole extended\nfamily around them. Here in Chicago, they all are from the south side or the west side\nand they -- they have hundreds of relatives around them, and I\u2019m jealous of that. People\ndon\u2019t realize how lucky they are that they have them, and I mean, they can fuss about a\nrelative this or a relative that, then I tell them, \u201c\u201cYou have -- You have no idea how I --\nhow -- how -- how I would love to have a cousin that I could fight with, you know,\nbecause it\u2019s better than having nobody around.\u201d But, it\u2019s with everything else, if you\ndon\u2019t know it, you don\u2019t miss it, and people don\u2019t realize it, when they have all this\nextended family, and so -- even if you bury somebody, even if you bury that\u2019s a pr --\nthat\u2019s a privilege compared to what we went through, cause nobody has a grave. Can\u2019t go\nanywhere.",
        "Q: Do you think so -- think a lot of people take family for granted, do you think there are\nother things that people take for granted that you might not, because of what you\nexperienced?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I guess always having food on the table, cause at the end of the war, we\ndidn\u2019t always have what we wanted. We went to bed and we said, \u201cMom, we are\nhungry.\u201d Oh, when I think about it, what we did to this poor woman, to tell her that we\u2019d\nlike to have another slice of bread and she couldn\u2019t give it to us, because if she gave us\nanother slice of bread, we wouldn\u2019t have bread in the morning, and everything was\nrationed, and I, for instance, didn\u2019t always get a ration books. So, then I ate from their\nfood, and the son told me so, not because he wanted to be mean, but he thought that was -\n- was cute, you know, to say, \u201cYou know, you ate my bread.\u201d Well, then I couldn\u2019t eat.\nSo, no, I am very ra -- very much aware of, that I never go hungry and that everything is\navailable and that I have a -- a good life. Oh yeah, I\u2019m aware of that.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just old enough so that when -- when I was very young, I don\u2019t know when this\nstopped, but it was pretty early in my life, that occasionally, you know, we\u2019d be eating\nand I didn\u2019t want to finish everything --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- that I\u2019'd been given to eat, and I can still remo -- remember my mother occasionally\nsaying to me, \u201cYou know, you should finish that, there are children starving in Europe.\u201d\nAnd you know, it became like this clich\u00e9 in a way, and I think when my brothers and I\ngot a little older, we\u2019d still occasionally hear that, and you know --",
        "A: Now you make fun of tt.",
        "Q: -- we\u2019d want to be -- well, we\u2019d want to be smart, so we\u2019d say to her, \u201cWell, you\nknow, so fine, so send it to them.\u201d You know, \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d or \u201cHow is me eating it\ngoing to help them?\u201d",
        "A: That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true.",
        "Q: But I guess she was referring to people like yourself were in the circumstances you\nwere in after the war, and during the war.",
        "A: Yeah, after the war, it was still very tight. But, well you realize, you know, when you -\n- once when you\u2019ve been hungry, it\u2019s a different story, of course. But there\u2019s so many\nunjust things in this world. I wish I could save the world, but it -- I try my best, just a\nlittle bit, you know.",
        "Q: How so? What do you do?",
        "A: I volunteer for Soviet Jews. Not the ones who are here, but the ones who are still\nthere. So, try to pay a little bit back to the world. But it\u2019s -- it\u2019s tough.",
        "Q: I think -- I\u2019ve done several of these interviews, and one of the things that always\ncomes up, one of the strongest things that people say, and that they refer to very often, 1s\nthe same thing you\u2019ve been bringing up here, 1s all those missing people, and sort of this\nkind of huge hole which 1s created at the center of your life.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: That can never completely be filled again.",
        "A: No, it won\u2019t.",
        "Q: Every-Everybody talks about that.",
        "A: Yeah. Ca-Ca-Cause that is -- that is what bothers us the most, I think, you know?\nWhatever you do, you know, you can make a million dollars, you can make 10,000,000\ndollars, 1-it -- that will never be able to come back in your life. You know, in my house I\nam surrounded with things from my parents and the clock 1s my mother\u2019s wedding gift\nfrom one of their friends. And you know, I -- I have peace with my mother having passed\naway at the age she did. I have less peace with my father having died as young as he did,\nbecause that must have been a result of the war. The sorrow and the anguish and\neverything else, he just didn\u2019t want to live any more. And -- And that\u2019s also indirect, you\nknow, a result of the war. So, there are things in my house that remind me of my parents,\nthat\u2019s fine, that doesn\u2019t seem to hurt. But there are also things in my house that remind of\npeople who have been murdered. And that -- that -- that always hurts, that always hurts,\nand it reminds me of them not being around, you know. It\u2019s something that will never be\n-- be fixed.",
        "Q: Tho -- Those type of things that you were just referring to, are there any of them right\nnearby here, that we can see from where we\u2019re sitting, or --",
        "A: No, this was from my -- my aunt.",
        "Q: That is -- Tell us what you\u2019re pointing to there.",
        "A: This is a -- This is a -- a silver tray that was in my aunt\u2019s house, and --",
        "Q: Which is filled with cookies right now.",
        "A: -- is filled with cookies, yeah. And it never should have been in my house. You know,\nthat\u2019s what it 1s, too, because she had a daughter. So, if she had passed on in the\nmeantime, it would have been in my cousin\u2019s house and not in my house. And that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s how it -- how all those things speak to you. So, you don\u2019t alway think about the\nperson directly, but then you see something in your house and you say, \u201cOh yeah, this\nwas from this [indecipherable]. Or when I say -- when I say a date you write down, you\njust -- you think of somebody\u2019s birthday or whatever special day. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s a big hole\nthat can never be fixed, can\u2019t mend it.",
        "Q: There are some people, I would imagine, who would -- feeling that way, who would\ntake those reminders out of their life, who would not have things, you know, like this\nsilver tray, or like the clock around. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t get rid of them totally, but\nthey, you know, you know --",
        "A: Put them away.",
        "Q: I mean often -- I mean, people have different responses to experiences, and sometimes\nwhen people go through very painful things, their way of coping with it 1s to take away\nthe reminders, to kind of put a barrier around and make a space where those thoughts\ncome up less. There\u2019s -- There\u2019s -- There are less physical things even around to prompt\nany thoughts like that.",
        "A: Well, we did that in the beginning.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: After the war. I guess we -- we just sort of had blinders, and just tried to do our\neveryday chores and tried to make life bearable again. But I don\u2019t think it -- it -- it serves\na purpose to -- to bend those thoughts out of your life, cause they -- there was -- they\nwere all people, they were all bright minds and -- and -- and wonderful persons. And I\nthink it\u2019s good to remember them, and to remind yourself that they were around one day.\nIt would -- 1 -- 1 -- I think it -- it -- it\u2019s good to remind them, in your mind, of things --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

It would -- 1 -- 1 --\nI think it -- it -- it\u2019s good to remind them, in your mind, of things that were also good in\nour lives, before the war. We think about the good old days. They were not everybody\u2019s\nhappiest days, but they, you know, they were part of our life, so I think it\u2019s good to\nremind yourself that they were one day around and sadly enough, no more. I don\u2019t want\nto push it away.",
        "Q: When you first came to the U.S. -- well, first of all, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever\nactually said your husband\u2019s name.",
        "A: Abraham DeLeeuwe. Al, we call him.",
        "Q: When you came over here at first, was it hard to adjust to this country?",
        "A: Oh, awful. I didn\u2019t know anybody. I spoke a little English, but not American English,\nand I was different. It -- It -- It\u2019s a altogether different life. So I guess I was lucky that we\nhad children right away, and -- and that brings you in contact with your surroundings, and\nthen somehow you make friends, and you get acquaintances, and when my kids were\nlittle, I met somebody in the synagogue, who said, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t stay home all day\nlong,\u2019 So she dragged me to -- to one of the meetings of -- one of organizations and that\u2019s\nhow I started, you know, getting part of the community. But it\u2019s hard to, especially in\nNew York, to get started if you don\u2019t know anybody. Here, it was different, here in the\nMidwest, people are warmer, and so they -- they come to you, and welcome you. It\u2019s\ndifferent, altogether different approach here. But in New York it was hard.",
        "Q: Did you live actually in the city?",
        "A: I lived in Queens, yeah, in the beginning, and then later on we lived on Long Island.\nAnd that\u2019s still New York.",
        "Q: Little different than Amsterdam, though, huh?",
        "A: A lot different, yeah, a lot dif -- well, I didn\u2019t live -- after the war we didn\u2019t live in\nAmsterdam any more, we lived like in the suburbs. And that was better, that was better,\ncause you didn\u2019t want to walk those streets every day, where you had so many sad rem1-\nreminders. It was a good thing that we moved away . . . yeah.",
        "Q: What were you thinking about just now?",
        "A: How th -- How hard it is. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s difficult sometimes to talk about it, too, you\nknow, and it\u2019s hard to express yourself.",
        "Q: Doing fine.",
        "A: Yeah, well, that\u2019s what they always tell me, but it doesn\u2019t always come easy, you\nknow. I never say no if they ask me, because I feel that I owe it to whatever, to talk about\nit. 1-- Normally, I don\u2019t talk about it, it -- you know, it\u2019s something that 1s inside me. And\nmy husband was here during the war, so he -- he also lost a lot of relatives, but he didn\u2019t\nfeel that -- the -- the anguish, you know, and the -- the Germans came to the house, and\nrang the bell, or they picked you up, or things like that, the -- the -- you know, always the\nnervousness that was around your life. So he didn\u2019t grow up, thank God, that way. But he\nsuffered enough from the war, of course.",
        "Q: When you think back on the time where that family had taken you in, and -- before\nliberation, or whatever, you did a video interview for the museum, now we\u2019ve -- we\u2019ve\ntalked for awhile. Is there any little story, or anecdote, or memory you have from that\ntime, that you haven\u2019t mentioned, that -- I mean, it could be anything, or just a little thing\nthat sometimes you remember that happened, or a conversation or some little incident, or",
        "A: Not really. You know, it w -- it w -- it was -- 1t was very serious household. They\u2019re\nvery orthodox Christians, I guess that\u2019s why they took me in, cause my stepmother told\nme, when I asked her why did you do this, she said, \u201cWell, when they came to ask me, I\nfigured God sent those people to me, and I have no choice.\u201d That was -- There was never\nanything fun, you know, that happened. Wa -- Ev-Everything was serious, it was a\nserious time, we -- we -- nearly every night, even before the start of the liberation, we\nended up in bomb shelters, because we were bombed. So, you know, it -- it wasn\u2019t a\npleasant life there either. It -- My father was up north, and nothing happened there, you\nknow, he had all good food, and he was with sweet people, and he walked outside all the\ntime. And, of course, he wasn\u2019t in his own surroundings, but he -- he didn\u2019t live under\nthat pressure, like we had every day, that they bombed the surroundings, and once he was\nin jail, he -- he wasn\u2019t so happy either, I\u2019m sure. But [indecipherable] really nothing\nextraordinary that I can think of, I mean, when I was there, it was most difficult.",
        "Q: You say nothing fun happened, it was very serious, was that because, you know, it\nwas a Serious and difficult time, or were these people also just very serious and --",
        "A: No, I -- I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the case, cause I remember not too long ago, couple of\nyears ago, when we were visiting, that we were having dinner and we had a bottle of\nwine on the table, and my stepmother said, \u201cWell, you see me, we can have a pleasant\ndinners, too.\u201d Everything was just tight in those days. I don\u2019t know how much money the\nman made, but they had to feed another mouth. I mean, there was -- they all had to\nsacrifice for me. And, you know, there was just always nerve wracking -- the\ncircumstances were just that way, they w -- and they were serious people, but the war just\nmade it that way, I think. And maybe me being there, too, you know. I -- I was a threat to\ntheir family life, there\u2019s no question about it. And they were s -- they were involved in\nunderground work themselves, too. I never knew that then, during the war, I found that\nout after the war, cause what you didn\u2019t know, you couldn\u2019t talk about. The least you\nknow, the better it was. But, no, 1t was just a very serious time. You know, you couldn\u2019t\ngo out, there was no radio, you couldn\u2019t -- th-there -- there was -- people don\u2019t\nunderstand it, how --how you grew up in those years, without having any fun, you know?\nAnd then, after the war, I was so serious and old, compared to 15 year old kids, because I\nhad -- it -- it -- 1t takes it\u2019s to -- it t-took it\u2019s toll, you know, being away from my parents\nand it\u2019s tension. And -- And the years before I was in hiding, you know, cause we -- we\nlived through all these -- these crazy times at home, but it was nerve wracking. I\nremember when my -- my youngest aunt was picked up with her husband, my mother just\nwent to bed. She couldn\u2019t deal with it. And the life was awful, life was just awful. Yeah.",
        "Q: But you\u2019ve had a decent 50 years since.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh -- Oh yeah, oh yeah. I -- I -- \u2019'm not complaining, you know. Sometimes\nI think, \u201cWell, what was the purpose that I -- I did survive?\u201d You know, why me? That --\nThat comes up many times in your mind. But I have a good life, I\u2019m -- I mean I -- I -- I\nwon\u2019t say I\u2019m -- I\u2019m every day in tears, far from. No, I have a good life, and I enjoy my -\n- my family and my husband, and even retirement isn\u2019t so bad. You know, we travel a lot,\nand we enjoy that, and we have -- we have fun with our kids. Nobody\u2019s life 1s perfect.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But -- And I think there are lots of people who have tragedies in their life, so I\u2019m not\nthe only one who had it difficult, you know? But this tragedy was so different from every\nother, normal tragedy 1-in life. Can get sick and die young, it\u2019s sad, but the whole thing is\njust unreal, but it happened, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s not something we -- we imagine.",
        "Q: That\u2019s about it for my questions, is there anything that you want to say a little more\nabout, or that didn\u2019t come up, that you want to talk about before we end the interview?",

It\u2019s tough.\nOh, I live for that, too. You learn, you learn. I -- When I first lived here, I couldn\u2019t drive\nin snow. In my life, I hadn\u2019t done that. But you have no choice here.

        "Q: -- that I\u2019'd been given to eat, and I can still remo -- remember my mother occasionally\nsaying to me, \u201cYou know, you should finish that, there are children starving in Europe.\u201d\nAnd you know, it became like this clich\u00e9 in a way, and I think when my brothers and I\ngot a little older, we\u2019d still occasionally hear that, and you know --",

        "Q: How so? What do you do?",
        "Q: I think -- I\u2019ve done several of these interviews, and one of the things that always\ncomes up, one of the strongest things that people say, and that they refer to very often, 1s\nthe same thing you\u2019ve been bringing up here, 1s all those missing people, and sort of this\nkind of huge hole which 1s created at the center of your life.",

Maybe they wouldn\u2019t get rid of them totally, but\nthey, you know, you know --",
        "Q: I mean often -- I mean, people have different responses to experiences, and sometimes\nwhen people go through very painful things, their way of coping with it 1s to take away\nthe reminders, to kind of put a barrier around and make a space where those thoughts\ncome up less. There\u2019s -- There\u2019s -- There are less physical things even around to prompt\nany thoughts like that.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Well, today is the 13\" of January, in 1999, and we are here sitting in my kitchen,\nin Highland Park, Illinois and the weather is awful. It\u2019s snowing, and snow 1s piled up\nvery, very high, and it\u2019s wonderful to be inside and not have to suffer outside in the cold.\nAnd we are sitting here talking about what happened to my life after we were liberated,\nand I\u2019m ready to ask -- answer questions, I think.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nend of the war. If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were,\nwhere you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time.",
        "A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish\narmy and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans. But I don\u2019t know\nmuch about that any more. The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely\nunder real war conditions. In September they started dropping the troops in Arnum, and\nsince I lived in Fenlow at that time, which isn\u2019t so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops\ncoming over in big airplanes, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and [ll\nnever forget it, because it was just immense. It -- It was never ending, big airplanes and\nlittle airplanes, which we later on found out were gliders, and that\u2019s really when our\nliberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire.\nAnd we -- we couldn\u2019t go outside any more and we didn\u2019t have gas and electricity and\nthings like that. And life became very, very difficult. I was still in hiding of course, and a\nfew very dangerous things happened to my personally. We had no food so my stepmother\nand her daughter went out to get food in the field, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and\nthings like that, cause the farmers couldn\u2019t get it, because the man didn\u2019t go outside, they\n-- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help\nthem in Germany, I guess. So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October,\nmaybe then already, that some Germans came to the house. I was there with my\nstepfather, who was in bed, because he was on strike. The Dutch government had told all\nthe people who worked for the railroad that they had to go on strike, so he did. And there\nwas a son in the house, who was supposed to be working for the Germans. So, he was\nalso somewhere hiding in the house, so I had to open the door. And the Germans said\nthey wanted to look in the house, and they looked in the house, and they decided the\nhouse was good. And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in\nour house for awhile. So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us. And they\nsometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my\nstepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn\u2019t used to doing the housework and\nall that sort of stuff, so I always went to bed early. So they never saw me. Course, they\nwere scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed.\nSo, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed\naway from the real fighting apparently. And then in December, we were finally liberated,\nbut that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people\nwho lived in our little town, and they had to all go across the River Maus, into Germany,\nand then up north, into the northern part of Holland. And they wanted all the regular\npeople out of town, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans\nand the British who were coming. So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers\nat all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went\ninto hiding. The man stayed somewhere, I don\u2019t know where, but we, the women, stayed\nin a bombed-out house, and there we stayed for a couple of days. There was some food,\nthere was water and that\u2019s where we were liberated. And it was, of course, still very, very\ndangerous, because the troops didn\u2019t cross the river, and it was constant bombarding and\ngrenade fire. So, we somehow crawled to our house, and then the British decided that\nthey didn\u2019t want us there, so we were evacuated to another town, and there we stayed til I\nthink the middle of April. In the meantime, Holland wasn\u2019t even liberated altogether, so\nwhile I was in the other town with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we\nwere free. My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name\nand my -- my father\u2019s name. And then the next day they ask me my mother\u2019s name, and\nso they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you\nnever talked about it and you never wrote that down. And they apparently gave that to a\nJewish organization who was trying to find all the children. And then they -- that\norganization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to Israel, but -- then\nPalestine, but I didn\u2019t want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow,\nwould find my parents back. I had no idea where they were. So, they -- they decided they\nwere going to keep me in the house for -- I don\u2019t know how long, maybe they would have\ntaken me forever. And then my father, who was hidden in Amsterdam first, but later on\nleft for northern Holland, somehow got himself involved in underground work. He was\nan artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the province where\nhe was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to England, so that\nwhen the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every house was, and where\nevery little obstacle would be. And then somehow he was caught by the Germans. They\ncame in the house to check something. He and the owner of the house were sent to prison\nbecause they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in. And thank\nGod my father didn\u2019t reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was\nJewish, so he spent a couple of months in jail. And had they known he was Jewish, they\nwould, of course, have killed him instantly. But he was liberated there. And as it was, the\ntroops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated. So, when my father\ncame out of prison, they somehow presented him with a list. And my maiden name is\nD\u2019 Ancona, D\u2019A, and when -- in Holland, it\u2019s -- the A counts as the main letter, so my\nname was on top, and my father found out that I was okay. But then the problem was he\nwas up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in Holland, especially\nin the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no roads,\nthere was no public transportation, no trains, no buses, nothing. So, since my father had\nworked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who\ngave him permission to travel. So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross\nthe rivers, and you know, on a bicycle without tires. And he came one day to -- to the\nhouse where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom. And well, he knocked on the\ndoor, and we didn\u2019t get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew\nright away it was my dad. And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the\nGermans and that she had gone away, that she was in the holding camp, Westerbork, and\nafter that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had\nsurvived.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: When I was in hiding?",
        "A: Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we all went in hide -- in hiding at same time. I\nwas taken by an organization to the southern part of Holland, and to a family that I had\nnever met in my life, didn\u2019t know the people, and --",
        "A: Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD. And the -- the\norganization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he\nhad helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans. When -\n- When you were picked up from your home in Amsterdam, small children were put in a -\n- sort of what -- what used to be a school, and the parents were across the street in what\nused to be a theater. And then, before they went on transport to Westerbork, and those\nchildren, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think,\nnurses, and people who took care of kids. And they went out for walks sometimes. And\nthe organization had made it their business to steal some of those children. So, every day\nwhen some of those kids were walked outside to get a little fresh air, -- and I\u2019m sure that\nit was prearranged with help inside, that certain children were going to be taken away. So\nthey had as many clothes on as possible. And then they walked at the end of the line,\ncause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young\npeople came and just stole them away. And how they organized getting rid of their papers\nand -- I have no idea. I guess that\u2019s known in -- in Holland how it went, but those\nchildren were just rescued. And I was still at home. I was one of the very, very last in\nAmsterdam, who lived in their own house and that was because we are Sephardic. My\nfather and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their\ncrazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were\ngoing to be descendants from Aranos, which most likely was true, and we were not really\nJews, we were Christians. So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared\nnon-Jews, not because they didn\u2019t want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to\nhave to go to the other side of the world. I don\u2019t know what -- what my parents knew\nabout what was waiting on the other side of the fence. I didn\u2019t know an awful lot, because\nas much as possible was kept away from me. But I knew, and everybody knew that, that\nit wasn\u2019t very good. So, we were in Holland; in Amsterdam still quote quote free, in\nOctober of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in Amsterdam walking\nthe streets. There was no school any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for\nJews any more. So, on the 16\" of October, my father decided that since we weren\u2019t\ndeclared non-Jews, we had to go. So, my father found this organization and they said they\nwould have a place for me. So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady\ncame to pick me up and she took me along to the station and there she handed me to a\nyoung man, and he took me on the train with another child that I never saw again, and we\ntraveled a long distance. We had to change the pla -- the train in the station and we took\nanother train. Then we finally came at the destined place and this young man said to me,\n\u201cWell, you just wait here.\u201d And he took the young man with him and came back maybe\nthree quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that\ntime that I had to wait at that station was like -- like a year. It was never ending, and here\nI was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old. I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware\nof the dangers. I had no name, I didn\u2019t know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and\nif they -- somebody had come up to me and said, \u201cWhere are you going, what are you\ndoing, are you waiting for somebody?\u201d I couldn\u2019t say anything. So, I was very, very\nscared. And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a bicycle, so I went\nwith him on the bicycle and he dropped me off at this family. And there I stayed for the\nrest of the year and -- and another year. And I was very, very different from my own\nhome. I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man\nwas working for the railroad, he repaired railroad cars. And they were fine people, there\u2019s\nnothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what\nthey were doing. And they were terrific. But 1t was an altogether different life than what I\nwas used to. They were going to church all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed\nevery day and I wasn\u2019t used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that\nthey wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my house,\nand so --",
        "A: No, no, no, they were Christians.",
        "A: They were Christians where I lived now. So, everything was different, and of course I\n-- | had just said goodbye to my parents, my father and my mother, and I knew very well\nthat that wasn\u2019t all that sure that I would ever going to see them again. So, at -- it was\nvery traumatic, and -- but I had to adjust, I had no choice.",
        "A: Oh, I knew that, yeah, hundred percent, yeah, I knew that if somebody was going to\ncome, that th-the man would most likely be killed, and the son, who was 16 or so at that\ntime, would have had a hard time, too, and maybe the whole family. You never knew\nwhat the Germans were going to do. But, no, they knew very well what they did, and\nafter the war, I asked them why did you do this? And then my stepmother told me that\nsomebody who was sent by one of the clergy in that town, came to their house and asked\nif they would take a child, a Jewish child. And she was willing to say yes right away, but\nshe thought it was prudent to ask her husband if he was thinking the same way. So, she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you have to wait til my husband comes home from work and I can tell you\ntonight.\u201d So, as it happened, their oldest daughter was going to leave home, and that is\nvery important because in those days, you couldn\u2019t buy beds, you couldn\u2019t buy linens,\nyou couldn\u2019t buy blankets, you couldn\u2019t buy anything, even if you had the money, it\nwasn\u2019t available, and so they could only take me if they had a spare bed. So when the\ndaughter left, I could take her place, so they told the man who came from the\nunderground, they could only have a girl, because I could stay with their other daughter\nin the same room. So that\u2019s how come I found this place, or they found the place for me.",
        "A: It was very strange.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s an awful situation to be in cause, number one, I was very\nnervous that I had left my parents, and that this -- this -- this whole town was -- was --\nyou know, it was so different from a big city, and everything in tha-that household was\ndifferent than -- than in my house, and I -- I was -- I\u2019m an only child, so I wasn\u2019t used to\nbrothers and sisters, and once I was settled a little bit, you know, they started to tease me\nand I wasn\u2019t used to that at all. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I\nwas old enough to realize that crying wasn\u2019t going to help. And I knew also that I had to\nbehave myself and that I couldn\u2019t be this spoiled brat and that I had to adjust, because if I\ndidn\u2019t do that, maybe the people wouldn\u2019t want to keep me, and where was I going to go\nthen? I had nowhere to go. And that is the -- an -- an awful feeling. If -- If they had put\nme out on the street, I wouldn\u2019t have had any place to go. I was far, far, far away from\neven non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I had no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had\nnothing. And I think that was the scariest part, that I had to really be as perfect as could\nbe, because I couldn\u2019t risk any problems in that house, so when they teased me I had to\ntake it and they didn\u2019t do that to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was\nnot. I couldn\u2019t go to school. The daughter went to a parochial school, but that was a long\nwalk and there was no transportation at that time any more either. So, they didn\u2019t want\nme to risk that big long walk to school. So I had to stay home and in the beginning I tried\nto do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn\u2019t there. So, my stepmother said,\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t get you in here to be my maid, but maybe it would be a good idea to help\nme once in awhile.\u201d So I -- I helped my stepmother with making the beds, and in those\ndays, everything was breaking, so we had to sew a lot and mend a lot and I\u2019m pretty\nhandy when it comes to that, so I helped and I liked that. And I loved to scrub, so I -- I\nlearned a lot. I learned a lot of things that my mother never would have taught me, and\nthat came in handy later, I think. So, I -- I had to do things during the day, cause I was\nbored stiff otherwise. And so my stepmother and I got along very well. When she went\nshopping, she sho -- most of the time took me along, cause she wouldn\u2019t let me home\nalone, and so we went shopping and -- but there wasn\u2019t much to shop, so we didn\u2019t do\nthat too much. And so that was the -- my daily job, to help and do as much as I could to --\nto not be a nuisance.",
        "A: They are the Shumachers. No, they are not alive any more. My stepfather died years\nand years ago. My stepmother died a few years ago. And she had willed that -- she had\nasked her children that when she was going to be gone -- in Holland it\u2019s usually that they\nsend out cards that somebody has passed away and an ad goes in the newspaper and she\nhad asked the children if they would resent it that sh -- they also put my name in as a\ndaughter. So they didn\u2019t mind, and so when she died, we flew over for her funeral. And I\nhad to sit right in front in the church, and the pastor knew about it, he -- he mentioned\nwhat they had done for me, and that I was there, and that they really looked at me as their\ndaughter, even though I wasn\u2019t their -- their real daughter. But, they were very, very kind\nto me, and up to now, we are still friends with the children, and the daughter who is the\nyoungest, was my best friend, really, because we -- we were together all the time. I\u2019m\ngoing to see her next week. And the daughter who left home and made room for me, 1s\nvery, very ill and I\u2019m going to meet her next week, too. She\u2019s in a nursing home and I\u2019m\ngoing to say hello to her, too, of course.",
        "A: That\u2019s in The Netherlands, that\u2019s in Holland, yeah.",
        "A: He was Johann and she was Aleida and then they had three children, Cynthia, Bowker\nand Yozeem. And the parents are honored in the Holocaust museum and they are\nmentioned on the wall upstairs as Righteous Gentiles, and they are mentioned in Yad\nVashem. I never get -- they got there, a big medal at one time, presented by Yad Vashem,\nas being Righteous Gentiles, and having saved my life. So, after the war, when we were\nliberated, and my father had come to my house where I was hidden, he -- he took me\nalong up north, where he had been living all that time, because we really didn\u2019t know\nwhat we were going to do. And there was a lot of food in the north, and where we were,\nthere was not so much. So my father took me along and after maybe two or three weeks,\nwe got a telephone call from Amsterdam, that somehow, miraculously, my mother had\nappeared. She had traveled for weeks, coming back from Austria, but she had arrived in\nAmsterdam and was looking for us. So, then my father and I went back to Amsterdam on\na milk truck. And my mother was like unreal. She was skinny and she used to be pretty\nwell rounded and she looked scary, and like a witch, sort of. And I was -- I was really\nscared of her. But, a-after a couple of days that -- I got used to it. Now, we didn\u2019t have a\nhouse at that time. She came to her brother\u2019s house, and so we were there, too, and --",

        "A: Scary and like a witch, sort of, and I was -- I was really scared of her, but after a\ncouple of days that -- I got used to it. Now, we didn\u2019t have a house at that time, she came\nto her brother\u2019s house, and so we were there too, and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t think she had survived.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Unreal, unreal. We -- We -- We didn\u2019t know where my mother had gone. We knew\nmy mother was caught at the place where she was in hiding, and after jail and I don\u2019t\nknow what else, she ended up in -- in Westerbork, in that camp before you go to -- to\nGermany or Poland. And since we had had this stamp in our papers, that we were most\nlikely not Jewish, and merranos and all that sort of stuff, which was like an exemption,\nmy mother had had that in her papers and the Germans didn\u2019t first want to recognize that,\nbut when she was in that camp, with the help of friends who lived there for quite awhile,\nthey recognized that. So, my mother was sent to Theresienstadt, and that was sort of the\nshow camp for the Germans. And that -- My father knew that she had been sent to\nTheresienstadt. But we also knew, after the war, that not everybody stayed in\nTheresienstadt, and so for the rest, we had no knowledge of what had happened to my\nmother. My -- My mother came back, though, she told us what had happened, and she did\nthe rounds. She stayed in -- She was caught in July of \u201944, which most likely is why she\nwas still alive, because it was sort of at the end of the war. She -- She went from\nTheresienstadt to Auschwitz, and there she stayed for about two weeks. And she didn\u2019t\ntalk much about that, but when she did talk about it, she said it was hell, and it was worse\nthan hell. They sort of stayed together, 10 Dutch women, and what was the best thing in\nAuschwitz was that if there was a transport to go somewhere else, cause nothing could be\nworse than Auschwitz. So, one evening, all the people who knew about that there was a\ntransport going, were lining up outside somewhere. And another story goes that\neverybody who is up front ends up going on transport, and the ones who are left over are\ngoing to be killed, that they knew. However, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so\nwhen all those women are fighting and -- and -- and -- and being excited about going\naway from Auschwitz, were standing 1n line, they let them turn around, so the ones who\nwere standing in front were standing 1n the back and the ones who standing in back were\nstanding up front. That saved my mother\u2019s life, because my mother otherwise would have\nbeen in the back, instead of in the front. Then she was transported to Lanzing, which was\n-- I guess nobody knows about that concentration camp. It was part of Mauthausen, in\nAustria. And there she had to work in a factory where they made rayon for parachutes.\nVery poisonous. People who work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food, have\nto drink a lot of milk, can\u2019t do it more than so many months, I guess, in a year, and there\nare strict rules, but for Jewish women that wasn\u2019t important, so they didn\u2019t get fed, and\nthey had to work very hard. They burned their skin and they were nauseous and sick\nsometimes, because all the poisonous gases and whatever. They -- My mother was fluent\nin German, and that sort of helped them, too, I think. My mother was -- I don\u2019t know ab -\n- if she was -- ca -- you can say she was a boss, but she was a teacher and so she knew\nhow to be ahead of the group, and so she told the Germans off whenever she could. And\nthey sabotaged a lot, too, cause if you put your finger on those instruments, then the\nwhole thing messed up, and they ruined I don\u2019t know how much. And so they were good\nat that. And somehow my mother survived, even though she got very, very ill there. They\noperated on her without any anesthesia, any -- any medicine, nothing. And even though\nthe German doctor who did it wanted to kill her, I\u2019m sure, he saved her life, because if he\nhadn\u2019t done that, I\u2019m sure she would have died. So, by the time she was liberated, she\nwas very, very ill, but the Americans took enormous good care of them. They sent them\nto hospitals, they had them x-rayed. Everybody who had TB was sent to a sanitoritum, and\nthe -- the medical staff of, I guess the military, took care of the prisoners. They stumbled\non this group of women. Now, my mother was with those 10 -- of which one had passed\naway, but there were also lots of Hungarian women in that group, and I don\u2019t know\nwhere those americ -- the -- where those Americans really took them. My mother talked\nabout flying to, I think southern Germany, and from there they were transported through\nSwitzerland, to France, and there they stayed for awhile, and then they came to Holland.\nBut you have a -- imagine that there was absolutely no normal transportation. Railroads\nwere bombed, and so it was very hard to get a train together and th-there wa -- there was\nno infrastructure whatsoever, so there was no mail. My mother wrote every day and we\nnever got those letters, until months and months later, after she had arrived. And then\nwhen we all three were back in Amsterdam, we didn\u2019t really know what to do. Our\nbusiness was dismantled, all our belongings were taken away. And somehow my father\nstarted again. He -- He got some help, I think, from the Marshall fund. That -- That\nwasn\u2019t something that they gave you, ee -- it was like loans. And in the same house\nwhere we used to live, we came back. But we had no furniture, we had no beds, we had\nno clothes, and --",
        "A: Well, it was -- but --",
        "A: -- n-no, other people had lived in our house, but the Germans had taken everything\naway. Practically everything was gone and s -- a few -- very, very few things were hidden\nwith friends, and we got that back, but sometimes you didn\u2019t get that back either, cause\npeople were used to having it and they didn\u2019t want to give it back. But we basically were\nhomeless and -- and penniless. And my father was in his 40\u2019s, in his late 40\u2019s, and he had\nto start all over again, which he did, but it was so difficult, because your support was\ngone. Everything that -- that used to be n-normal ju -- before the war, and during the vi --\nfirst year, maybe, of the war, was gone. My grandparents were gone. All my uncles and\naunts were gone, all my cousins were gone, all my friends were gone. My parents friends\nwere gone. You -- You had nowhere to go. That what -- was very lonely existence. And\nnow, after 50-plus years, you -- you wonder how we did it. We didn\u2019t talk about what we\nhad lost, we didn\u2019t talk about how terrible it was. It was something that wasn\u2019t talked\nabout and you just sort of try to make the best of everything. And my mother was sort of\nnot normal when she first came back. She -- And she never was going to get to dress\ndecent any more, who needed it, and who wanted to wear stockings, hose. or things like\nthat, th-that wasn\u2019t necessary. But after maybe half a year, she was sort of the old\nmommy again, and --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know, my mother wasn\u2019t depressed. No, she -- she was stronger than that.\nNo, she had had typhus in -- in the camps, and I guess she was just so undernourished and\nso -- had been so sick that it took a long time to recover from that. And they had suffered\nso much, of course, and she never talked about much, cause I\u2019ve a-asked my children\nabout what did Omar ever tell you, and she never talked about camps with them. She\nnever talked about the war, but we never talked about we missed this person, or how sad\nthe way our family came to their end. It -- It was just a subject that wasn\u2019t touched. And I\nguess that it took many, many, many, many years before anybody could talk about it, and\nrealized that we all buried that inside us.",
        "A: It was -- It wa -- wa -- It was too awesome, it was too -- too big a problem. I don\u2019t\nthink anybody could understand it, how it could have happened, why it happened. It wit -\n- It was so unreal, it was something that nobody wanted to -- to understand, and I think\nthat basically -- I\u2019m not a psychologist, but I think that basically, everybody felt guilty\nthat the -- the few that -- of us who did survive, did survive. And I still have that myself,\ntoo. I so many times ask myself, why did I survive and not my very best friend, or m-my\nvery dear cousin? It -- It -- It\u2019s such a terrible thing that happened, that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you --\nyou can\u2019t explain it. And so I think it was so painful, and it hurted so much, that we just\nfigured, don\u2019t talk about it, and maybe it goes away. The truth ath -- is that with the years,\nI think the -- the pain never goes away and you keep on missing those people. I -- I -- \u2019'm\nfixated with my grandmother, and I was a kid when she died, and I -- I have -- I\u2019ve -- I\ntalk to her in my mind, and I -- I can see her still in her house, in my mind. And I -- I -- I\njust have problems sometimes with why, why did all those people have to be killed? They\nwere all honest, hard working, were not in anybody\u2019s way and they were just regular\ncitizens like the rest, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s some th -- very, very troublesome part of a life, and it\n-- | don\u2019t think it will ever go away. I mean, I live a very comfortable life now, and I have\n-- thank God I have -- I have a family, but that pain will never go away, that always\ncomes back somehow. And, if you live in a -- in a society like we are living here, you\nrealize what you\u2019re missing, too, because people have like school gatherings, you know,\nthey have reunions of their school. And -- And they have family affairs and you see 40 -\n50 - 60 people coming, maybe even more, and I have nobody. I have a cousin in Toronto,\nand that\u2019s my closest relative. And all my uncles, all my aunts, my cousins, they\u2019re all\ngone. And maybe they were not my best friends, but that -- that part of your life is so\nempty. And you don\u2019t realize it every second of the day, but you know it\u2019s there. And if\nthere are happy occasions in your family, you can\u2019t share it with relatives. Now, thank\nGod, we have good friends here, but it\u2019s still different than your own family.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a tough one. I prefer not to go to s -- Germany. I -- I can\u2019t hold it against\nyoung people, or people my own age for that matter, so most of the Germans who did\nwhat they did, are not around any more. However, when I see or meet a German, I can\nthink in the back of my mind, maybe your grandfather or your father did to my\ngrandparents or my uncles and aunts, which is the unthinkable, but they did it. And I\ncan\u2019t hold it against anybody, but I\u2019m not very comfortable with Germans, I have to be\nreally honest. I wouldn\u2019t drive in a -- in a Mercedes. I -- I would think of a staff car,\nespecially when it\u2019s black, I would think, \u201cOh, that\u2019s the SS.\u201d Or the [indecipherable]\npolici. A crazy thing, I cannot have a Krupp coffee maker or a Krupp any machine in my\nhouse. I have a Brown coffeemaker, also comes from Germany, but it doesn\u2019t have the\nsame connotation as Krupp. Krupp is a bad word in my imagination, so I don\u2019t want to\nsee it in my house, I can\u2019t stand that.",
        "A: Of all the war, and -- and -- and -- and what they did to us. About the Dutch, I don\u2019t\nthink I feel as strongly a-about the Dutch, as about the Germans, but I know now that the\nDutch, as a whole, could have done a lot more, including our queen. Queen Wilhemina\nnever talked about anything, not on the -- on the English radio, about stand up against the\nGermans, try to help your Jewish neighbors. Never, ever that that came about, and they\nturned to her, then they thought, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too dangerous to help the Jews.\u201d I mean, I\nwas too young to realize all those things maybe then, but when you think about it, when\nyou\u2019re a grown-up and an adult, you wonder why not more people had tried to help. On\nthe other hand, I know that it was extremely dangerous, because Jewish doctors only\ncould t-take care of Jewish patients and non -Jewish doctors couldn\u2019t take care of non-\nJewish -- of Jewish patients. Everything was segregated and we had never had that in\nHolland. Holland was a very liberal country. As a matter of fact, my ancestors came to\nHolland after the Inquisition, and Holland welcomed them. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It -- It\u2019s very\nhard to -- to really judge and to say, well they could have saved more, because everybody\nknew that if they did help Jews, they would be punished like Jews. On the other hand, if\nlots of people would have stuck together, maybe they would have been able to\naccomplish more. In Belgium they did a lot more for the Jews than they did in Holland.\nAnd it\u2019s -- it -- it -- it sh -- true it wasn\u2019t publicized, I mean, so most of the Jews lived in\nthe big cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, maybe The Hague, and in some s -- all over the\ncountry. And the -- the population in -- in the smaller towns, might not have known\nexactly what happened to the Jews, but the masses in -- in the big cities, did know. They\nsaw it. | mean, part of Amsterdam was cordoned off and nobody could move, and they\nwent house to house and house, an-and picked up the Jews. And 1-it was -- it was a very\ndifficult thing. I can\u2019t blame them hundred percent because I know how dangerous it was\nto help Jews. On the other hand, you would have liked to had a little more help from the\nmasses. And they did it once when they had the strike, when the first Jewish young\npeople were picked up, they had a strike in Amsterdam, all the municipal workers\nstopped working and it was a mass demonstration that day, and there was is a monument,\n[indecipherable] dock worker in Amsterdam, to remind us of that. And that was fantastic,\nbut it was one day, and then they went back to work, and the Germans went back to pick\nup Jews. So, it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t say that I -- I -- I hated the Dutch people for it, but in hindsight,\nyou could say they could have done a little more for us.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I read it for many, many years, and | ha -- I don\u2019t think I have read it all\ntogether. I -- I -- ve seen it and I\u2019ve taken a few pages here and there.",
        "A: Yeah, I guess so, yeah, I guess so. And there\u2019s a lot of controversy about it now,\nunbelievable. I think it was a beautiful thing, because it gave the world insight of what\nhappened to us, and how -- how people who absolutely had nothing wrong done, were\nconvicted and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and persecuted. And it give the -- the world an\ninsight of what -- what it was all about. But, still I don\u2019t think the -- the -- the pain that\ncame afterwards comes out of that, because that\u2019s not what she experienced. She was one\nor two years older than I was, and I knew her, because she lived 1n a neighborhood where\nI used to live, and I had a friend there, so I -- I knew her so ve-ve-very -- very casual.\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, well -- well very casual, I mean, if y -- 1f you would -- I -- I -- I know she lived\nthere and we played outside once, or twice maybe, you know. You know, all those little\nkids there in the neighborhood. But, you know, she was a very nice kid, but very\nintelligent that she could write about it the way she did. I was not able to do that in those\nyears, I wasn\u2019t that -- that verbal and I wasn\u2019t good at writing, or anything.",
        "A: The Franks, you mean?",
        "A: No. No, no, I don\u2019t know. You know, you were all too much involved with your own\nproblems, that I-I didn\u2019t know the family or anything like that. You know, you were so\ninvolved with -- and the very few people who were there, and who needed support, and\nwho were your support, people that -- that you didn\u2019t know about, or were -- that -- that\ndidn\u2019t come up in our lives, you know. Our lives were tough because we had -- we had to\nwork so hard to get back to -- to where we were before. And I think about it, I have the\ngreatest admiration for my father, who somehow managed to get a factory back to work,\nand make some money. And, I mean, we had a house again and later on, we had -- with\neverything we needed again. It\u2019s amazing how it -- it all came back. And what was very\npainful after the war was that some people left money and -- and belongings and there\nwere big fights in families on who got what, and nobody had a will, cause you didn\u2019t\nthink of things like that. So you inherited from the strangest people and from your closest\nrelatives, you sometimes didn\u2019t inherit. And then the -- the government took enormous\namounts of money as taxes of those inheritance. We had people who had valuables were -\n- and who came back after the war, tried to get their valuables back from friends, or from\na-acquaintances, and people just didn\u2019t want to give it back, they said, \u201cOh no, that was\nmine.\u201d And they were so used to having those things that they didn\u2019t want to give it back.\nTh-The -- The strangest situations arose, that made it hard to get friendly with people that\nyou used to be friendly with. What was it -- it was a strange, empty life, right after the\nwar, and it took years to sort of come back to a normal life. For instance, I had gone to --\nI\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve had -- finished elementary school, and I -- I was supposed to go to some sort\nof a high school, but I did that for one year, but that year was so strange, because people\nwere not showing up the next day, teachers weren\u2019t showing up the next day. You know,\nthere was always somebody who was taken away by the Germans, so the school was not\na normal school year. And so when I went back after the war, I went for three years to\nhigh school, and then I just quit, because I just couldn\u2019t stand it, I was in the meantime\nthis grown-up -- I had gone through so much that I wasn\u2019t this 15 year old kid when I\ncame out of the war. I -- I -- I just didn\u2019t have the patience to sit in class an-and study. So,\nafter three years I quit and I went to work. And I helped my father in his business.",
        "A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufactured like sportswear, things like that. And\nI-I worked in the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

        "A: He produced corsets and we -- we manufactured like sportswear, things like that. And\nI-I worked in the office and I worked in the factory, too. That was better for me, I think.\nSchool was just not challenging enough at that time, I -- I didn\u2019t have the -- the brains to -\n- to put myself to work, and my mother would have loved to see me go to college, but --\nwas big disappointment, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I was better off doing something with my\nhands and keeping my mind occupied that way. And so I worked for many, many years,\nand for -- later on my father sold the business, cause he was sick, and so then I had a\nregular job. And I lived in Holland til I was 31, and then I married and came to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: How I met my husband? My husband 1s originally also from Holland, and that family\nwas very lucky, they made it just in time out of Holland before the war. I guess they were\non the boat when the war broke out, or something that close. And so my husband, as a\nsmall child, was growing up in the United States. After the war, the family went back to\nHolland, because they used to have businesses there, and my father-in-law wanted to see\nwhat he could salvage. So they stayed in Holland. But having grown up in the United\nStates and then coming back to Holland in a small town, being my husband was very st --\nrather observant, it was sort of an impossible task. So, he came back to the United States\nwhen he was 18, and then he ended up in the service, during Korea. He ended up serving\nin Morocco and when he was discharged, they asked him to stay on, and he worked in\nWeisbaden, Germany. And that way he came home once in awhile. So that\u2019s how we\nmet, because they lived sort of around the corner. And then we married, and he lived in\nthe United States, but we married in Holland and then I came with him here.",
        "A: We started out in New York City, and we lived on Long Island and then he was\ntransferred to Washington area, and we lived between Washington and Baltimore. And\nthen we got transferred to Chicago, and that\u2019s where we are now.",
        "A: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. I -- I felt bad that I left my parents and I never realized\nhow hard it was for them that their only child was leaving. I really never thought of that.\nBut I was happy, I was marrying a very nice guy, and I had never wanted to go to the\nUnited States, it never was any attraction to me. But I had no choice, it was either\nmarrying my -- my lover and go with him to the United States, or not marry. And so I\nchose the United States and my husband. And I\u2019m not sorry. I love it here. I don\u2019t think I\nwould s -- go back to Europe. I love Europe, I love to travel there, love the culture and I\nthink you miss that in the United States. But -- The old buildings and all that sort of stuff.\nBut, I don\u2019t think I could settle in Holland any more.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s painful. I ha -- My parents passed away in the meantime, too. So, I have my\nmother-in-law, my sister-in-law and her family, and that\u2019s all very well, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nempty for me there. And here I have good friends, and my kids.",
        "A: No, no, no, I was just married.",
        "A: I have two sons, I have two sons and one lives, thank God, 1n Chicago. The other one,\nfor the time being, lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil. So, that\u2019s far. But we -- we have travel\nprivileges at United Airlines, because my husband used to be pilot. So we travel easy and\nhe can come home once in awhile. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s far, but 1t\u2019s not that far that it\u2019s unreachable.",
        "A: One, the youngest is David, he\u2019s 34. And Isaac, he\u2019s 35, the oldest. And sadly enough,\nthey\u2019re both single, but that\u2019s something I can\u2019t do anything about any more.",
        "A: They know I would love -- I would love them -- to seem -- see them married, but there\ncomes a time that a mother has to keep her mouth shut.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, it\u2019s their business, you know, I can\u2019t mingle in any\nmore.",
        "A: No, I stayed home. I was 31 when I married, I was 32 when I had my first ca -- child\nand we decided that it was better for me to stay home and raise the kids. And in those\nyears, it might have been nice if we had had a little extra, but over the years, being an\nairline pilot, we -- we had a decent income, and it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to -- to go to\nwork, so I was a stay home mom. But I did always do something, volunteer work, so --\nand I\u2019m still involved in that.",
        "A: No, my mother didn\u2019t talk about it. No, the kids know that I was hidden, and they\nknow about th-the family that I was with, and they know some of them. And they have\nvisited, too, there. When they were in Holland, I took them along there, and they visited.\nNot too many times, but we did go there. And --",
        "A: To Holland to visit my step-parents.",
        "A: They -- They knew about it, and somehow they, over the years have told me that I am\nOo -- too overprotective, because -- and they -- they blame that on the sort of holding onto\nthem, and it\u2019s a result of the war that I am the way I am. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. They\nalways say, well Jewish mothers are always overprotective. I don\u2019t think that is true, I\nthink that all mothers are protective of their children if they\u2019re normal mothers. But, I\u2019m\nalways happy when I know they\u2019re coming, that they\u2019re home and worried that -- I think\nI wor -- I worry -- I -- I worry that th-they got an accident, or that something happens to\nthem, and I\u2019m always happy when they\u2019re home and then they\u2019re safe around. But they\nknow my story and -- and they know how difficult it was. And they missed too, the par --\nth-the -- the family. They -- They have no extended family, as such. So, they -- they --\nthey know what -- what the war did to them, too. It\u2019s -- They have three cousins in\nHolland, my sister-in-law has three daughters, but that\u2019s all they have. And they have this\none uncle and this one aunt, and there is nothing else, you know, that comes after that. So\nthey too, feel the -- the pain of not having a big family, like other people around here.",
        "A: Well, they -- my -- my father and my father-in-law -- my father-in-law passed away\nbefore we were married, my father-in-law -- my father died right after we were married,\nso they never knew their grandfathers, but my mother came regularly and my mother-in-\nlaw, too, so they know their -- they knew my mother very well, they had a good\nrelationship with her, and they have a very good relationship with my mother-in-law. My\nson from Brazil calls her like every other week, and -- and they -- they value that very\nmuch, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, she didn\u2019t talk about that, no.",
        "A: In -- I don\u2019t think they ever asked and she never talked about it. She never talked\nabout it. The only thing [indecipherable] that she was in Auschwitz in October, and when\nmy father had passed away, she came regularly here in the winter, because those long\nnights and those lonely days, especially in October, she didn\u2019t want to be alone because\napparently she always re-lived the horror of those days in Auschwitz, and -- and she liked\nto be here with us. She didn\u2019t talk about it, but I know that\u2019s why she wanted to be away.\nNo, she never -- she never mentioned it, she -- she was very close, though, with all those\nwomen who were with her in the concentration camps, and all of them, exe -- except one,\nI think, have passed away. But they were all like sisters, like good support for each other.\nThey -- They understood each other, and they -- without talking about it, they -- they\nknew what was going on in their minds, I think. They -- They needed each other very\nbadly. And they were very, very close bunch, all those years. But no, my mother didn\u2019t\nsay much about it and I guess the kids never thought of asking. Maybe they didn\u2019t dare, I\ndon\u2019t know. Never came up.",
        "A: I\u2019ve seen that. I basically don\u2019t go to war movies, I don\u2019t go to -- I don\u2019t read books on\nthe Holocaust. I hate real war movies, like shooting and things like that. My kids never\nhad guns. I\u2019m very much against war, because I lived through it and it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s so scary,\nit\u2019s so horrendous. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve seen the last movie, \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d which has mixed\nreactions from some people, and I know the Holocaust is not to make fun of, but I\nthought the movie was very sensitive about what happened, it -- I feel it\u2019s like -- like a\nlittle -- not a fairy tale, what\u2019s the right word? A fable, you know. How it starts early in\nthat life of the man and the woman, that they -- they fall in love and they have a good life,\ngood family life. They have a cute little kid, and already the anti-Semitism comes in with\nthe mother, and then in the war -- of course, in the concentration camp it wasn\u2019t that way\nit is depicted in -- in this movie, but the love of the father to protect his child, 1s -- 1s -- 1s\nso beautiful. I think that the film 1s really very, very special. And I went there by mistake,\nbecause if I had known it was all about the Holocaust, I wouldn\u2019t have gone. But I -- I\nwasn\u2019t sorry I saw it. And I saw \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d And the -- I never saw \u201cShoah.\u201d And\nI don\u2019t want to see movies on -- on -- on the Holocaust, on th-the -- the camps and things\nlike that. I\u2019ve been to the Holocaust Museum, few times. But I find that difficult. I find it\nvery difficult. It\u2019s when you see all those mass of shoes, I think, \u201cOh maybe the -- my --\nmy -- my uncle\u2019s shoes are in there,\u201d or my whatever. All those pictures. It\u2019s something\nthat will never leave us.",
        "A: And I know most of those people that I mourn all the time, wouldn\u2019t have been here\nany more, you know. By this time, most of them would have been gone. My p -- My\ngrandparents for sure. But it -- it was -- you can\u2019t realize that -- that all those people were\nmurdered, for what? Just because you\u2019re Jewish? And as I say, my parents were atheists.\nThey didn\u2019t do anything about being Jewish, religiously, that is, for sure. And -- But\nHitler didn\u2019t care. Hitler didn\u2019t care.",
        "A: Well, my husband came from an o-observant home, and I learned, in my hiding days,\nabout religion. And so, after the war, I guess I made up my mind that I -- I wanted to\nmarry Jewish, because I thought -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but that was in my mind, that\nsomebody who was Jewish, could understand better what went through in my head once\nin awhile. And so that was a hard thing, because most of the people in my age group, in\nHolland, were gone. Were very few eligible men. So, it took me awhile to -- to find the\nright one, or the right one to find me. And so, since his mother is observant, I decided that\nit was prudent to start out with a kosher home. And then we, somehow, when the kids\ngrew up, we got more observant, and my husband 1s very observant, I am a little less\nobservant. But we keep a kosher home, and we keep all the holidays. And the kids are not\nthat observant. We tried to teach them, and it\u2019s up to them now. They went to parochial\nschool, here in Chicago. At least they had a good Jewish education, and they know what\nthey don\u2019t want to know when they know what it\u2019s all about. And we -- we tried to be an\nexample. But it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to be very religious when I know some people all\ntogether forgot about religion after the war, others went just to religion to get strength in\nlife. There are always so many questions that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard, 1t\u2019s hard to believe\nthat everything just was for some reason. I can\u2019t de -- I can\u2019t deal with that. I th -- I can\u2019t\nbelieve that was God\u2019s plan. But who am I to know?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t find an answer. No, how can you find an answer to this? I mean, it\u2019s\nterrible when -- when -- when some person shoots one person for one reason or another,\nfor hatred, for -- for jealousy, for whatever. And -- But -- But how can you murder so\nmany people? I mean, it\u2019s not just the 6,000,000 Jews, there were 6,000,000 other people\nalso killed, homosexuals and Gypsies, and whatever. People that were not hundred\npercent the way Hitler wanted them to look. When you were born with some defect, you\nwere destined to go. That\u2019s not life, that\u2019s not right. No, I haven\u2019t found an answer to\nthat. I never will find an answer.",

But it\u2019s also because\nhere people have so much family, especially in Chicago. When we lived in Baltimore, in\n-- in -- in Columbia, Maryland we lived, everybody was imported from somewhere. It\nwas a new city and everybody was from somewhere. So nobody had the whole extended\nfamily around them. Here in Chicago, they all are from the south side or the west side\nand they -- they have hundreds of relatives around them, and I\u2019m jealous of that. People\ndon\u2019t realize how lucky they are that they have them, and I mean, they can fuss about a\nrelative this or a relative that, then I tell them, \u201c\u201cYou have -- You have no idea how I --\nhow -- how -- how I would love to have a cousin that I could fight with, you know,\nbecause it\u2019s better than having nobody around.\u201d But, it\u2019s with everything else, if you\ndon\u2019t know it, you don\u2019t miss it, and people don\u2019t realize it, when they have all this\nextended family, and so -- even if you bury somebody, even if you bury that\u2019s a pr --\nthat\u2019s a privilege compared to what we went through, cause nobody has a grave.

So, then I ate from their\nfood, and the son told me so, not because he wanted to be mean, but he thought that was -\n- was cute, you know, to say, \u201cYou know, you ate my bread.\u201d Well, then I couldn\u2019t eat.\nSo, no, I am very ra -- very much aware of, that I never go hungry and that everything is\navailable and that I have a -- a good life.

And maybe me being there, too, you know. I -- I was a threat to\ntheir family life, there\u2019s no question about it. And they were s -- they were involved in\nunderground work themselves, too. I never knew that then, during the war, I found that\nout after the war, cause what you didn\u2019t know, you couldn\u2019t talk about. The least you\nknow, the better it was. But, no, 1t was just a very serious time. You know, you couldn\u2019t\ngo out, there was no radio, you couldn\u2019t -- th-there -- there was -- people don\u2019t\nunderstand it, how --how you grew up in those years, without having any fun, you know?\nAnd then, after the war, I was so serious and old, compared to 15 year old kids, because I\nhad -- it -- it -- 1t takes it\u2019s to -- it t-took it\u2019s toll, you know, being away from my parents\nand it\u2019s tension. And -- And the years before I was in hiding, you know, cause we -- we\nlived through all these -- these crazy times at home, but it was nerve wracking. I\nremember when my -- my youngest aunt was picked up with her husband, my mother just\nwent to bed. She couldn\u2019t deal with it. And the life was awful, life was just awful. Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh -- Oh yeah, oh yeah. I -- I -- \u2019'm not complaining, you know. Sometimes\nI think, \u201cWell, what was the purpose that I -- I did survive?\u201d You know, why me? That --\nThat comes up many times in your mind. But I have a good life, I\u2019m -- I mean I -- I -- I\nwon\u2019t say I\u2019m -- I\u2019m every day in tears, far from. No, I have a good life, and I enjoy my -\n- my family and my husband, and even retirement isn\u2019t so bad. You know, we travel a lot,\nand we enjoy that, and we have -- we have fun with our kids. Nobody\u2019s life 1s perfect.",
        "A: But -- And I think there are lots of people who have tragedies in their life, so I\u2019m not\nthe only one who had it difficult, you know? But this tragedy was so different from every\nother, normal tragedy 1-in life. Can get sick and die young, it\u2019s sad, but the whole thing is\njust unreal, but it happened, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s not something we -- we imagine.",

        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Yeah -- th -- th --",
        "A: No, but you -- no, no, but we haven\u2019t had it for -- the last one was about 11 - 12 years\nago, maybe. I don\u2019t know exactly. \u201970, we came here \u201976, in 77 - \u201978, 1t was awful.\nThat\u2019s 20 years ago. I don\u2019t know what -- how long ago it 1s that we have that. For the\nlast couple of years, I can\u2019t remember having shoveled snow, but this is awful.",
        "A: Yeah. And then the hard part is to get out of driveways and to -- to see your way out\nof those -- those mountains. You don\u2019t know if somebody\u2019s coming, yes or no. It\u2019s tough.\nOh, I live for that, too. You learn, you learn. I -- When I first lived here, I couldn\u2019t drive\nin snow. In my life, I hadn\u2019t done that. But you have no choice here. If you don\u2019t want to\ndrive in the snow, you -- you\u2019re stuck here, sometimes for months. So, we deal with it,\ndrive careful.",
