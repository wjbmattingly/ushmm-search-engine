        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nVera Glasberg, conducted today by Judy Cohen, on January 7\", 2009, in the\nhome of Mrs. Glasberg in Alexandria, Virginia. I thought that we could start by\njust telling us something about your early childhood, where you were born, where\nyou grew up.",
        "Answer: Well, I was born in Riga, which at the time of my birth, which is 1912,\nwas still Russia. It 1s today an independent country, Latvia. I don\u2019t remember Riga\nat all because my parents moved to Kiev, which then was also Russia, became later\nUkraine, when I was about one year old. Av \u2014 we\u2019ll th \u2014 Kiev I remember very\nwell. We lived at a beautiful home, and a big courtyard, and it was a \u2014 a \u2014 a sizable\napartment. When \u2014 in 1917, when the revolution broke out, and the \u2014 the\ncommunists were \u2014 how should I say \u2014 assigning free rooms and apartments to their\nmembers, my parents decided to rent their apartment themselves. And there was an\nItalian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house, and her little girl \u2014 her\nlittle daughter was my playmate. And I have very good seven years from that time.\nThe theater gave sometimes operas for children, like Sad Sultan, or The Cock\nDoor, and The Golden Cockerel. And through this, the mother of my little friend\nAnnata(ph), we sometimes got seats to go and see these operas. In addition, she\nwas getting ballet dances \u2014 lessons, and so I got them myself also; my parents\nthought it would be a good idea. It was a wonderful time for me as a child. For my\nparents it was much more difficult because there were shortages of all kinds. My\nfather was arrested once for no reason except that he was a capitalist. And\nfortunately he was released twice when he was arrested. But in the meantime, there\nwas, for instance, no water. And my mother had sometimes to go in the middle of\nthe night when it was announced that there was some water somewhere in another\nquarter. And she would carry \u2014 come home carrying two pails of water for \u2014 for\nfood and for washing. I was not aware of all these hardships. But after he \u2014 my\nfather was released for the second time from prison, he said, no more, I want out. I\nwon't stay.",
        "Q: So tell us something about the experiences that \u2014 where you left, why you left,\nhow you left.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s where he got a \u2014 and a-\u2014 kind of a \u2014 edificial assignment to go for a\njob which was a \u2014 a fake job, to Riga for two years. That\u2019s why he was \u2014 we were\nable to leave the country legally. He could take his family, and take belongings\nnecessary for a two year stay. However, the trip was most unusual. We were\ntraveling in a train with cattle cars. We were sitting on the floor. We were part of a\ngroup of, if I recall, three or four families, which little \u2014 we all had little stoves,\nkerosene little stoves. The train would stop every once 1n awhile in the middle of\nthe field that \u2014 that was \u2014 that \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s continue. So, tell me about the car, the rail car that you went to.",
        "A: The rail car was a cattle car, there were no seats. We were sitting on the floor, on\nhay, or whatever it was. And it was very primitive. The tri \u2014 the trip must have\ntaken at least a week, if not more. And it would stop \u2014 the train would stop in the\nmiddle of the field, and we were all \u2014 were sucha \u2014 su \u2014 you know, supposed to get\nout to refresh ourselves with the snow, it was in winter, in January. We had little\nkerosene stoves. We made water out of the snow for tea. Everybody had,\napparently, food with us. I don\u2019t have any recollection of being \u2014 of famine. But it\nwas extremely primitive and I thought it the most exciting adventure you can think\nof. So, all my recollections of that time, which for \u2014 for adults were very taxing, for\nme were great fun. In Riga we had family. My mother \u2014 my mother\u2019s uncle was a\npsychiatrist who had a mental institution, which was the institution of the city. And\n\u2014 but we were not permitted \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 I speak of me as a child \u2014 to even go\nnear it. The house where the family lived was in a big \u2014 how should I say it \u2014 estate,\ncompletely separated, and that was where the family lived. Couldn\u2019t see it at the\ninstitution, even though the \u2014 the windows. And then again, there was one of the\nwomen who was helping in the household, had a daughter Ludiczka(ph). And\nLudiczka(ph) was my playmate, again I had one friend, I never missed friends. So,\nI had a wonderful time. We stayed there until spring, and after \u2014 after that, my \u2014 my\nuncle on my father\u2019s side, had in Finland \u2014 also, he was a wealthy man, had a big\nestate in Finland, and the whole family of the Hessens(ph), which is my maiden\nname, were reunited there on the \u2014 on the farm. There there were chickens and two\nhorses. I was sometimes permitted to go on the chariot with the \u2014 with the horseman\nto bring somebody to the train station through the woods. It was wonderful. There\nwas a lake, and one of my cousins was a little older than I was, and he was my\nplaymate, and we went fishing in the lake and canoeing, and so forth.",
        "Q: But, I understand you didn\u2019t stay there that long?",
        "A: No, it \u2014 we were invited, we were the guests for the summertime. And then my\nfather went to Danzig where the same brother had the insurance company of the\nfleet on the Volga. You see the \u2014 it was the \u2014 well, see family and my father\ndirected the office in Danzig. My mother and I went \u2014 stayed in Berlin, because\nfirst we \u2014 the whole family went to Berlin and my father left. And my mother and I\nstayed. We had rented a room in the apartment of a theater critic. And he always \u2014\nhis wife was not in good health, and he used to always to take my mother to first\nshows in the theaters in Berlin, which at the time, in the 20s at that time, was in full\nswing. And I was attended \u2014 was in \u2014 registered for the first time in my life to a\nschool, because until then I was home tutored, both in Russia and in \u2014 in Riga,\nalways I had home tutors.",
        "Q: So tell me, what was it like as a young girl, as a refugee? By then you had lived,\nactually in four different countries for varying lengths of time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How did you adapt to all these changing circumstances?",
        "A: Until then it was no problem. It was always something exciting, new and\nwonderful. For the first deception for me was when we left Berlin and joined my\nfather in dan \u2014 in Sopot, which 1s a little town, a sea resort actually, attendant to\nDanzig. It is the distance like from Alexandria, Virginia to Washington, D.C. It is\njust attendant, but it is on the North Sea and a \u2014 a sea resort by the next \u2014 Poland,\nwhich 1s practically next door. So, during the summer season it was invaded by the\nPolish [indecipherable] community which came to play in the cansino(ph) and so\nforth. But I went to a German lyc\u00e9e, which was a good school, but I hated it,\nbecause after the Russian school, which was on a very high level, the faculty was\nthe cream cup of faculty from Russia, \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Russia, whereas here there\nwere \u2014 how should I define it? Only women, only old spinsters, anti-Semitic,\nunfriendly. Very resenting the \u2014 the \u2014 the additions that came, and made probably\ntheir job difficult, because my German was practically nil. And my marks at the\nbeginning were awful. I didn\u2019t learn German grammar, it was terrible. I had to write\na composition, it was full of mistakes. It took me time.",
        "Q: So was there \u2014 was their attitude to you more disdainful because you were a\nimmigrant who didn\u2019t know German, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, of course.",
        "Q: \u2014 or do you think it was \u2014",
        "A: They went a \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you mentioned the anti-Semitism, h-how \u2014",
        "A: That they were to begin with. That \u2014 because to there at that time already many\nrefugees from Russia who got kind of squeezed in there. And they were \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t like \u2014 it was a different culture. They were very narrow-minded, they were\nvery \u2014 you know, like little towns. Whereas Russia, from Russia people came from\nSaint Petersburg, from Kiev, from Moscow. It was a different type of families.",
        "Q: And how did you respond to that?",
        "A: Well, you know, at that age, you just suffer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: What can you do, you don\u2019t have to revolt. However, you know, there too we\nhad nice times. I made friends with \u2014 with these people from Russia, of course. And\nwe went in \u2014 for instance once, to make an experience, and to write a note in several\nlanguages, which we got together, and put the \u2014 the note, with my address because\nth \u2014 I had invented that, so ha-happens, in a bottle. We sealed it and we threw the\nbottle into the sea, and later completely forgot about it, even though a few months\nlater we got a real \u2014 an answer from somebo \u2014 students in Sweden.",
        "Q: What language did they write back in?",
        "A: They wrote in \u2014 I \u20141f I remember correctly, in German. Broken German. And\nthey offered to correspond before we get together, but our parents, our common\nparents said to us, it\u2019s na \u2014 not a good idea, because they were students already, 19\nyears old, we were 12. So \u2014 so it was not the thing to do. And we obeyed. There\nwas no revolt. Parents said, that was it. But it \u2014 it was a nice \u2014 it was a nice time. I\nhad man \u2014 lifelong friends from that time. We had competitions who would be the fi\n\u2014 the first one would g \u2014 win who will go and take the first cold swim in the spring,\nand without interruption until the fall. You see, children\u2019s play, it was a good time.\nAnd yeah, I lived there for \u2014 yeah, I would say for almost five years.",
        "Q: At the time you left, if someone was to ask how you identified yourself, did you\nstill think of yourself as a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, or were you thinking \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Although, at \u2014 by that time \u2014 by that time we were no longer\nofficially Russians, because we never got back, as it was understood. So we loos \u2014\nlost the citizenship. We were at that point citizens of no country. We didn\u2019t belong,\nwe had no protection from any country. And a member of the then League of\nNations, by the name of Nansen(ph) has created for people like my family, a\nspecial document which was called the Nansen(ph) passport, which was not \u2014\ndidn\u2019t look like a passport of a regular country, which was a sheet of paper with\nsome name, date of birth, indication \u2014 all the information that the passport has. But\nthat was our passport, and forever gave us trouble, because usually the people at the\ncasa \u2014 the borders had never seen such documents.",
        "Q: Do you remember what stage your family got these? When they were living in\nSopot already, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. When we had to leave, you know, to \u2014 to cross a border. For instance,\nonce or twice my mother and I from Berlin came to the summer for to visit my\nfather in da \u2014 in Sopot. The Poland refused to even accept this document as a doc \u2014\nofficial document. So the car in which we were traveling was sealed, buco \u2014\nbecause \u2014 1n order to get from [dog barking] Berlin to Sopot, we had to cross two\nborders, you know, to enter the Poland, and exit to the Poland. God forbid we\nshould get out, you see. Sealed car. Christina? [indecipherable] my thoughts. Q:",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I was telling you that we were \u2014 we had to go through Poland in sealed\ncars. And wherever later we moved from Sopot finally, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable] the Volga, I don\u2019t \u2014 I cannot tell you what exactly happened,\neither the office closed or my father had no other possibilities. He was offered a job\nin Brussels, in Belgium. A job which \u2014 my father had two doctorates, he was an\nengineer from Belgium and he had a doctorate of mathematics from Saint\nPetersburg, with a gold medal. But he accepted the job to sell off used cars in \u2014 in\nBelgium, just to show you that permutation saved their lives. They never\ncomplained, never.",
        "Q: And how old were you when you made the move to Belgium?",
        "A: Well, I was elated pa \u2014 by that time I was 17. And to \u2014 leaving this Sopot, this\nsmall town and go to Brussels, the capital of Belgium in the west, it was very\nexciting. I was 17, but I still had to switch school because I didn't finish the lyc\u00e9e. I\nhad two \u2014 the aptitude to make [indecipherable]. I had to have the pre \u2014\nuntaprima(ph) and dobaprima(ph). And each time I had to change languages;\nfrom Russian first to German; from German then to French. The French that I have\nlearned in school was nothing. So \u2014 well, we arrived in Belgium, and what can I\nsay? Very soon after my father arrived there, maybe a year, the \u2014 the \u2014 the garage\nwith the used car collapsed. Well, by that time, when I finished the lyc\u00e9e, which\ncorresponds years \u2014 to two years of college, the [indecipherable] is bachot, French\nbachot you know what that means?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It is a different organization of schools. I knew that I had to help the \u2014 with \u2014 the\nfamily with finances. So I registered in a business school and I decided I\u2019m going to\ncontinue my education at this first opportunity, and did it throughout my life. I went\nto business school for six months. By that time it was summer, and one luxury that\nmy mother permitted herself, was to once a year to go to Riga to visit her mother.\nSo while she was away, it so happened that the t-touring club of Belgium, which is\nlike the ma \u2014 automobile association here, was looking for somebody for a member\nof their staff. And they usually request that somebo \u2014 to send them somebody the\nbusiness school where \u2014 that I was attending. And before I even had finished it, the\ndirector of the school picked me to ask me if I was interested. Was I interested? Of\ncourse. So I have \u2014 was very proud that I got the job before my mother came home.\nSo that was my lengthy period in Brussels, until May 10\", 1940.",
        "Q: That means before then though, that while you were living in Brussels\ncorresponded to the time that Hitler had come into power in Germany, and later on\nthe invasion of Poland, before that the annexation of Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were these events that you were following at all? Did you ever think that it\nwould reach western Europe, or was it far distant news?",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 it \u2014 it was \u2014 it was \u2014 how should I say? Nobody could imagine what\ncould d \u2014 that something of that caliber could ever happen to begin with. On the\nother hand, I must also confess, to my shame, that at that time I was a very \u2014 how\nshould I say \u2014 carefree, cheerful, a little bit superficial girl who loved dancing, who\nloved friendships, excursions. Politics were not my strength. My husband, if I had\nmet him that \u2014 that area, we would have never seen each other again, because he\nwas very much involved in politics. He was active in the labor Zionist movement,\nvery active. So, it is funny, we lived in the same town for 10 years, both of us, had\nmany common friends, and never met.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s then move to the day, May 10\", 1940.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What are your recollections of that day, and what was the response of your\nfamily?",
        "A: That day \u2014 that day was a sunny, beautiful morning and we r \u2014 I remember\nwaking up and couldn't understand. I thought that 1t was a thunderstorm. And the \u2014\nhow is possible, the skis \u2014 sky is blue. And all these explosions, c-could it be a\nthunderstorm? So, it\u2019s \u2014 it was very strange. But then of course, word came out\nimmediately. I went to work, everybody went to work, and for us, very soon people\nstarted \u2014 as soon as people understood that it is the Germans who are invading,\nthose who had cars and funds, started moving, moving south.",
        "Q: And did your family leave immediately, or did they \u2014",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "Q: \u2014 debate at all?",
        "A: Not at all because we had no means \u2014 the little means that we had, it is only very\nrecently before the invasion that we moved to our own apartment, we used to have\nrented rooms before, at our house. My parents lived in the attic and I lived in the\nlittle \u2014 small, little attendant room downstairs, it was very \u2014 really, it was my\nmother who managed everything remarkably well. They shared the kitchen, we\nshared the bathroom. It was very, very difficult life for them, and again, not very\nmuch for me. For me it was all a very easy going \u2014 so, what I was going to say that\nthe big expense that we have made the \u2014 before May 10\", maybe before the one\nMay fifth, is to buy a\u2014I cannot say a refrigerator because it was not electric. It was\na cold box, you know, with pieces of ice. And here if the war breaks out, the day\nwhen that ice thing was delivered. So \u2014 but, I must say that the president of the\ntouring club, who was an unusual person, told me, because one, I was a fit \u2014 I think\nI was the only Jewish person in the staff \u2014 don\u2019t stay. Whether you have means or\nnot, take what you can carry and leave. Take the first train and go south. Go to\nParis and see what you can do later. And what he said was \u2014 was very meaningful\nto my parents, too. So, after two or three days, that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: Did you have any trouble leaving Belgium at that point?",
        "A: Yes, because after \u2014 when we were almost at the French border, there was a\nbombardment at night, and they broke the rails, the train couldn\u2019t continue. It so\nhappened the train had stopped at the station, so we left the \u2014 the one or two\nsuitcases that we had at the station, and continued on foot, going south.",
        "Q: Were you carrying any luggage with you at all? Just \u2014",
        "A: A handbag, just a handbag.",
        "Q: Clothes on your back?",
        "A: Yeah, clothes on the back and the little te \u2014 suitcase. Strangely enough \u2014 fate 1s\nstrange \u2014 we met good friends of ours, and the wife of \u2014 it was actually a friend of\nmy husband, but I knew her vaguely, too. She had the French passport, she was of\nFrench origin, and there was a train forming, but only for French citizens. So here\nshe was, Mimi was her name, Mimi was running to the train and waving her\npassport. Her husband and the three of us, my parents and I after her, and then\nnobody checked the documents or tickets, nothing. In the car \u2014 again a cattle car.\nAgain that\u2019s everything closed, totally dark. Was crazy.",
        "Q: And then where did the train take you?",
        "A: The train took us to Paris, and there we were welcomed by the Red Cross with\ncoffee, the Germans will never get here, you\u2019re welcome, blah, blah, blah. So there\nwe separated from our friends, and we ha \u2014 we had family, my father had family in\nParis. So \u2014 but of course, we couldn\u2019t stay there, we stayed overnight, but they\ncouldn\u2019t put up three people. And that was announced that people who can support\nthemselves can take a train that will be forming the next day. One will be going to\nToulouse, and the other to Bordeaux, south. By mere chance, we chose Toulouse.",
        "Q: Tell me about Toulouse.",
        "A: Toulouse. It is called la ville de violette. The violet city. It is charming, but\nactually, it is an industrial city. The \u2014 there is a \u2014 an enormous factory for airplanes.\nThis enormous new airplane, this monster is being built there, 1s being finished\nthere. But it has a certain charm, and some cultural life, certain interesting things\nthat we couldn\u2019t think about that very much. And we met some friends from \u2014 from\nBrussels. Nobody wa \u2014 knew where to go, nobody had means to go to a hotel. We\nbought a paper and saw that there was a house for rent, an empty house for rent, and\nwe decided to \u2014 to get \u2014 to pull together and rent this house and live there as a\ncommunity.",
        "Q: Who are these friends?",
        "A: These friends were two Russian families. One [indecipherable] I mean, the \u2014\nthe adults of that family are already gone, but the s \u2014 one of the sons of our friends,\nwho was 14 year olds when I got married finally, in this house, visits me here now.\nHe is an 80 year old friend, and I have known him, of course, forever. And another\nfamily. So \u2014 and we \u2014 it was well organized. We made a whole government there,\nthere was a so-called president. My father was the minister of agriculture, because it\nwas a little garden that we planted vegetables.",
        "Q: And what a \u2014 who were the other ministers, what were the other jobs?",
        "A: There was a foreign minister, was running every day to all the consulates to find\nout where you can leave again, because at that time that part of France was not\noccupied, was free. But you never know. And it was later. Then there was a\nminister of the interior, that was my mother, who was in charge of the household.\nShe int \u2014 the \u2014 the mother of this young man I just described and [indecipherable]\nminister interior, then \u2014 then there was the young generation, the supplies, because\nwe had to run around and find supplies, as I told you. There was no butter, there\nwas no milk, there was \u2014 as time progressed, very difficult.",
        "Q: And I understand it wasn\u2019t just the three families, that other people came as well.",
        "A: Oh, my goodness. Word came around that there is such a community that exists\nand there were forever people appearing at the door. Some people some people\nknew, and some people who didn\u2019t know anybody, we just heard about it. And there\nwere always a meal, and there were always a shelter overnight. Some stayed for one\nnight, some stayed for a week. Some stayed when they had further visas, some\nothers not. It was amazing.",
        "Q: How did you make the rations last for so many people?",
        "A: Well, as I say, everybody contributed, energy, effort, and knowl \u2014 not everybody\ndid everything. Everybody had their decided needs. I-I had a friend, this young man\nAndr\u00e9 would lend me his bicycle, and we would go to the country and buy some\neggs here, and a little, I don\u2019t know, cream there, or cr\u00e9me fraiche, or something\nlike that. And the younger ones, after dinner did the dishes. The low \u2014 the ladies \u2014\nthe mothers were cooking, and the younger generation did the dishes.",
        "Q: And did the Vichy government interfere at all, or did \u2014",
        "A: No, there were \u2014 there were, as I say, there were \u2014 they didn\u2019t mind. There was \u2014\nafter all, we were contributing in a way to the \u2014 to the life of the city by buying, and\nbehaving, and it was paying the rent and so forth. So \u2014 and then people, by and by,\nbegan to leave. And that\u2019s how very good friends of ours who came \u2014 who came to\n\u2014 to \u2014 to say goodbye, brang s \u2014 brought some [indecipherable] just said, we\u2019re\ngoing to go to a house, there were go \u2014 a house of nice peoples, come along. But\nthat particular time I didn\u2019t pay much attention to Sam, because the president of the\ntouring club of Belgium also arrived in the [indecipherable] because he was\nlooking for his son who was a colonel in the Belgian Army. And he had learned that\nin Montpelier, which is halfway between Toulouse and Marseilles, there were lists\nof Belgian officers. And he asked me to come along with him. He \u2014 I think my\nparents would have let me only with Colonel Mitey(ph) to \u2014 to leave Toulouse by\ntrain, but he had the diplomatic passport, and then my [indecipherable] passport\npicture is \u2014 was [indecipherable] that I was secretary of so and so. So I could\nalways travel with him without effort, without difficulties.",
        "Q: But then I understand that you met Sam again shortly afterwards?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you talk \u2014 tell that story?",
        "A: Well, I was running somewhere and I met Sam in the street, and we stopped and\nchatted for a minute. And he asked me if I happened to be free the next day, that he\nis going to visit some friends, and they\u2019re going to make music to play, and he was\ngoing to sing. And to me it sounded as if he asked me to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, to fly to\nMars, because everybody asking only in which consulate that you go. And so that\nwas nice. And then he told me about the plans to organize this farm, this kibbutz.",
        "Q: Tell me about the farm.",
        "A: Well, the farm, he got funds from the labor Zionists to rent a \u2014 all this was his\nidea, he rented an old castle, was rather dilapidated. But it was beautiful, it was a\ncastle, really, and surrounding grounds with woods and plains. And enough funds to\nhave some cattle, goats and cows, and a horse, and what else? Chickens galore and\nturkey, you name it. And mostly his idea was just because the soldiers that I told\nyou were gone, people who had no means of support and were \u2014 I mean, they were\nnot mishandled in any way, but they were not free, in Gurs. You know what Gurs\nIS.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They came to work on the farm.",
        "Q: How did he get them out of Gurs and to the farm?",
        "A: Because he announced in Gurs that there are \u2014 there are jobs needed on \u2014 on \u2014 in\nGaillard. That there 1s a means \u2014 there is \u2014 they planted \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember what they planted. I was only paperwork worker. I occasionally visited\nthere after that, of course, but that was at \u2014 about 20 miles from \u2014 from Toulouse,\nnot far. And \u2014 and so it was to everybody\u2019s satisfaction that Sam was terrific, he\nalways knew how to \u2014 people are tired, worked very hard, there was not much food.\nBut still, they \u2014 they knew it\u2019s a matter of life and death, literally, because you\nknow, you never know what happens tomorrow. In fact, it did happen finally, they\nwere occupied.",
        "Q: Did you keep up with the people, the other ones on the farm? Do you know what\nhappened?",
        "A: After we left?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, they became a center of resistance, yeah. They were \u2014 they were \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were good people, yeah.",
        "Q: And I \u2014 do you remember anything more about \u2014 were they refugees, were they\nfrom \u2014 mostly German Jews, or [indecipherable] Jews?",
        "A: No, they were not \u2014 there were some German, there were some Polish. There\nwere some that were still from Belgium also. There were not so many. There would\nbe \u2014 I would guess that there was maybe 25 - 30 people, not more. Some of them\nSam knew personally, Sam, he was \u2014 he was reading the references and so he\nwanted \u2014 he wanted a homogenous group and not quarrels and you know \u2014 and it\nworked. It really did.",
        "Q: What type of activities did people do when they weren\u2019t busy planting the crops?",
        "A: What they were doing?",
        "Q: Yeah, for relaxation. Did they have \u2014",
        "A: They were collapsing to sleep, I assure you.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know \u2014 there was no television, and there was no \u2014 but, you see, I\nremember one evening at \u2014 that sticks always in my memory. The winter was\napproaching and needed wood for \u2014 for heating and for cooking and for ever, and it\nwas low. It had to be done, there was no time during the day, and after dinner\neverybody was tired. So Sam, already at the dinnertime, he began saying \u2014 hello\nBecca.\nR: Hi Nana.",
        "A: This is my granddaughter Rebecca.\nR: Hi, nice to meet you.",
        "A: You don\u2019t mind?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: So, he said, look, it\u2019s nice evening, let\u2019s go out, make a tour and sing. Take a\nlong some \u2014 how do you call it, the \u2014",
        "Q: Axes?",
        "A: Axes. We went out singing, and on the way with axes, came back with tons of\nwood, and everybody was a good mood, exhausted and tired, still did.",
        "Q: What type of paperwork were you doing? Was this accounting, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, at the beginning we needed a lot of permissions forms and all that. And\nonce the farm was organized, there was no need for it, you see. So it was \u2014 it was \u2014\nit was functioning very well. And if occasionally there was a need for a letter that\nwas \u2014 he became friends with the mayor \u2014 who married us, by the way \u2014 the mayor\nof that little village, was called Grenard(ph). And he \u2014 at that time there was no \u2014\nno gas, and nobody had a car except the \u2014 the personalities. So the mayor rent us his\ncar to drive from Deymarie(ph) to the Chateau de Gaillard. And my parents and\nthe witnesses followed all in a horse pulled cart \u2014 cattle.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s step back a bit, the wedding, when did Sam propose, how \u2014 and tell me\nabout the wedding day.",
        "A: Well, I came to visit Sam in Gaillard for \u2014 over the new year. And that\u2019s when\nhe gave me the ring that had belonged to his mother, because nobody bought any\ngowns or rings or any things of that sort. And that ring has an interesting story.\nMuch, much later, when this young lady was getting married, I decided to give her\nthe ring of my husband\u2019s mother. And to my horror, I had been away, it had been\nstolen. I had a break-in in my house. But we worked it out anyway, there was\nanother ring. So \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: So, was \u2014",
        "A: I went \u2014 I went to Gaillard over \u2014 yeah, overnight, and you see, later the ladies\ntold me \u2014 the ladies of [indecipherable] told me they [indecipherable] and to the\nbig fancy hall in the gi \u2014 1n the castle, which had been the bull hall, because it had\ntapestries, they were moth-eaten, but they were beautiful tapestries. He went in\nthere, he said, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to get married. I didn\u2019t even know it.",
        "Q: So, it was a time of rationing, of shortages, but you still had a \u2014",
        "A: I have only good remembrance of that time. I really have nothing sad, where it\nwas so difficult for most people, and I must say [music playing] there goes my\nphone. Becca, do you \u2014 can you give it to me. Excuse \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019ll cut \u2014 pause. [break]",
        "A: \u2014 occasionally, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. So you were telling a little bit about the wedding day.",
        "A: So, the f\u2014 we had two wedding days. The first was a civil wedding in this\nvillage of Grenard(ph). As I said, the mayor married us, and he \u2014 heh-heh \u2014 that is\nvery French, he said, in our country, the one who married has the first kiss. So he\nembraced me. And, as I say, he lent us his motorcar. We were like princes of - Sam\nand I. And my parents and my witnesses followed in a horse drawn \u2014 how do you\ncall it, the place when you put in hay? They were sitting \u2014 it was not for people,\nthey didn\u2019t need that for people.",
        "Q: A wagon?",
        "A: Wagon, yeah. Anyway, we arrived in \u2014 and then there was a festive reception in\nGaillard, and we had chickens and the ducks and the goats, little goats, all that\nmixing with the people in the reception. It was most unusual. And then, the next day\nwe had a re \u2014 a religious wedding from a rabbi who came to the house to be\n[indecipherable] and married us there. And I think in the book there is a\nphotograph of it, where all the people who at that time were in the [indecipherable]\nmany more came. And they made it wonderful, and for those times, that was a\ndinner, that was a feast. So \u2014 and yeah, now, the only thing was, I had no clothes.\nThe wedding was in the same suit that I wore coming from Brussels. On the road,\nin the trains, everywhere. But for the wedding at home, I had to wear something a\nlittle more presentable, but I didn\u2019t have any. So a friend of mine happened to pass\nby, and we had similar figures, she lent me a dress.",
        "Q: I understand that once you got married, you weren't \u2014 you were still separated for\na while.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because since we were going to leave the following \u2014 and \u2014 and very\nsoon, I wanted to stay with my parents. And Sam returned to the farm. So we saw\neach other for weekends here and there, but I didn\u2019t want to go and live on the farm.",
        "Q: So tell me, you were talking about you were going to be leaving. How did you\nget a visa to get out?",
        "A: He had a visa to get out when I met him, from Rabbi stat \u2014 Stephen Weiss.",
        "Q: Had he ever met Rabbi Weiss before?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so. But he knew of Sam because he worked very \u2014\nwas very active in the labor Zionist organization in Belgium. So Sam had this visa\n\u2014 he, as a matter of fact, had already used the entrance to Palestine, but he had\ngiven it to somebody else. My children ask me sometimes, why didn\u2019t he go to\nPalestine, why did he go to the United States? I cannot answer that, I don\u2019t know.\nHe probably had reasons for it. One though that comes to my mind 1s that his\nparents were alive. His father, rather. His mother was already gone. And he was \u2014\nhe was \u2014 he needed support, financial support, and that, of course, was not possible\nfrom Palestine, because people went there to dig roads, and to build. And Sam\nwanted to get a job and su-support his father, and that\u2019s what he did.",
        "Q: So you had the visa, was \u2014",
        "A: So -",
        "Q: \u2014 there a time expiration on it, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, that was the interesting thing. We both went to Marseille from the\nhoneymoon, to extend the visa for two. And the American consul asked us, do you\nwant a tourist visa or an immigration visa? Who cares? You know, is that we\u2019ll\ncome back to Europe anyway after the war is over tomorrow afternoon. Whatever\nyou give us, we\u2019ll be grateful. And this man did something that I much later\nunderstood. He was forbidden to give out immigration visas, and he did, he gave us\none.",
        "Q: Do you know who signed for your visa?",
        "A: I never knew, f\u2014 and you know, I don\u2019t remember the name. I wish that it \u2014\nbecause I understand that some of them were \u2014 there were several consuls who were\ndoing it, and they were demoted. And somebody told me even that one of them a\nstamp was done in his honor, because he really was deported or fired altogether\nbecause he helped so many Jews to escape.",
        "Q: Can you describe what the scene was like at the American consulate in\nMarseille? I se \u2014 were there crowds of people [indecipherable] you just \u2014",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "Q: \u2014 walked in, no?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. No crowds, no. Be right there [indecipherable] no, because people\nwere dying to get a visa, but you could only get one if you had the permission to get\nout of France, and proof that you have visas to get through the countries you have\nto get \u2014 to get there. Which on the other one \u2014 on the other hand, were difficult to\nget without the v \u2014 end visa.",
        "Q: So how did you get your transit visas?",
        "A: Well, you see, some \u2014 some people got stuck on the way, like for instance in\nCuba. We know a friend who s \u2014 well, got stuck in Cuba. Couldn\u2019t \u2014 had to wait \u2014\nwaiting for the American visa. We had no problem once we had to prove that the\nemergency visa was official. We got \u2014 we went through Spain and Portugal and\ntook a boat to Lisbon.",
        "Q: So describe what the process was like leaving France, going through Spain, any\ndifficulties you encountered?",
        "A: We sure did, we sure did. Well, we left \u2014 we left early August, I think. It was \u2014 it\nwas very difficult for me to leave, although the arrangement was that Sam and I\nwould go \u2014 we had no money, practically no money, and the trip was paid by the\nHIAS [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, he said [indecipherable] HIAS would takes\ncare, but it was paid for us. And we would get organized and a year later my parents\nwere to join us in the States. We left in 41, in August \u201941, they were to come in\n\"42.",
        "Q: Did your parents have visas?",
        "A: No. But once we were there, there was, you know, we were 1n the States, there\nshould be no problem in finding, you know, for parents to join, close relatives that\nwould have been no more. And that\u2019s what happened, eventually. I went to\nWashington for an affidavit, got it right away.",
        "Q: So describe crossing the border into Spain \u2014",
        "A: Well, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 crossing the border into Portugal.",
        "A: We left by train. There were friends on the way, in the mountains, near Po(ph),\nwhich is near the Spanish border. We had some friends who came out to see the\ntrain pass and wave to us. They couldn\u2019t see us, of course, but we saw them. On the\ntrain we met a Spaniard, a charming fellow. We are going to spend a night in\nMadrid. When he heard that we were s-stopping \u2014 he was coming back after the\ntour or army, he said, I\u2019m going to show you Madrid, and took us \u2014 he went home,\ntook a shower and s \u2014 kissed his wife and came out again, met us at the hotel and\ntook us around in Madrid. It was really very nice, yeah. So \u2014 but the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe real event was at the border between Spain and Lisbon, because that was\nactually for the first time entering the freedom, because Lisbon, Portugal was a\nneutral country. Spain was still fascist, 1t was still allied of Germany, but Portugal\nwas free. So, this is the last border, entrance into freedom. They took our luggage,\nand made us open the luggage and took our passports. The train 1s about to leave in\ntwo minutes, everything is ready, we were going to have some sandwich and relax.\nEnters the official and says, lady, off the train. What? My husband can continue, but\nI have to get off. So Sam told me it makes no sense for us both to stick here. I will\ngo, and there\u2019s only one train a day \u2014",
        "Q: And when was your ship leaving?",
        "A: The next day. The next day. And one train a day. That he told me, call the\n[indecipherable] immediately, call the police, call whoever you can do, you will\ncome tomorrow.",
        "Q: Why did they take you off the train?",
        "A: They took me off the train because as Sam\u2019s wife, I was listed as a Polish\ncitizen, and I had the Nansen(ph) pass that they never seen in their life. Something\nwas not right, and during wartime, you don\u2019t play. And there was no time to make\ndecisions or make calls. So here was the train leaving with my newly wedded\nhusband, and the ship leaving the next day. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember crying, but I\nmust have been because later I realized that my cheeks were wet. And the same\nofficial came and said, don\u2019t cry. Let him go. You\u2019ll get married, you\u2019ll stay here.\nHe was actually very nice.",
        "Q: So how did you straighten it all out?",
        "A: I did call the [indecipherable] and they \u2014 and when Sam arrived they\nstraightened it out, the matter of \u2014 of the papers. And I took the next train, Sam met\nme at the station. We took a taxi, which was a luxury, but I needed inoculation for\nsmallpox. And we literally got to the boat 50 minutes before they put up \u2014 pulled up\nthe planks, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: I understand that they \u2014 once you were on the ship though, you had some better\nluck.",
        "A: On the ship we had better luck. I see you remember and you know. Yes, it was\namazing. The \u2014 the leader of the [indecipherable] group to \u2014 which had paid our\npassage, Sam introduced him to me. And he came back and asked me if I knew how\nto type. Well, I was deep in thoughts about leaving my parents and the whole\ncountry and the continent of Europe, and that was very advantageous because they\ndoubled \u2014 that would double our fortune; 25 dollars in those years was like 250\nnow. And \u2014 and we were to eat in first class. And I, without my husband, would\nshare the \u2014 a stateroom with another lady, and he was in the hold, where we were\nsupposed to stay.",
        "Q: That\u2019s not in the book.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t mind. So that\u2019s what happened, tha-that was fun too, because they\nwere very nice Portuguese officers, nice, friendly, handsome. And I was working\nthree hours a day, and people on \u2014 on \u2014 on the ship saw that I was member of the\nstaff. So that was great fun. And we arrived in Staten Island on September 2\",\n1940, Labor Day. And the ship stood in the \u2014 in the harbor, they didn\u2019t take us on\nboard because it was Labor Day. And you see those lights of Manhattan, it was\ngorgeous. So it went.",
        "Q: So yes \u2014 so, well the time you were in New York during the war, were you able\nto correspond with your parents at all?",
        "A: Yes, because my mother was working for the Swiss Red Cross, we were able to\ncorrespond through the Red Cross [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Through the whole war, or \u2014",
        "A: No, the beginning. I would say maybe for \u2014 for half of the time, if at all. Maybe\nfive, six months. But they were saying months, years, couple of years. About half of\nthe time we were separated was \u2014 was actually fifti \u2014 yeah, five years. My parents\narrived by the first commercial crossing after the war had ended.",
        "Q: How did you discover they were still alive?",
        "A: That was interesting. My mother met in the street an American soldier, and\nasked him to send me a note from them by \u2014 how is it called, the American special\nway for the soldiers? Do you know what that 1\u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] mail?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: To mail APO.",
        "A: Yeah, APO mail. So I got one day a letter from the soldier, with regards from\nmy parents. Was fantastic, because th-the \u2014 the regular mail didn\u2019t work yet.",
        "Q: Did your parents share much about how they survived?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s strange. They never liked to talk about it. All I know, that they\nwent underground. All I know that they had false papers. All I know that they were\nat the beginning hidden by a family where I had the \u2014 the gall to tutor a woman in\nEnglish, who kind of took a liking to me and with my imperfect knowledge, she\nsaid it was useful for her. So I was tutoring some people who were \u2014 wanted to\ncome to the States. And she helped out. I don\u2019t know much, but they survived. You\nknow, there were many French heroes who hid Jews. Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, I know that you and Sam, once you got the States during those, you know,\nfour years when it was still war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Both of you, in different ways, were working to get visas for people who were\nstill over there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you talk about that at all?",
        "A: No \u2014 yeah. Sam did it personally because h-he \u2014 he \u2014 during his work still in\nBrussel had many contacts here and there. And then there were the strangest\ncoincidences. One day \u2014 we lived then at the corner of Broadway and 110\" Street,\nhe came down into the subway and saw a man who was visibly just arrived, who\nwas kind of looking around a little bit lost. And he came up to him, he could see\nthat he was a Jew who arrived recently. You know, there are certain signs you\nrecognize. He came up and asked him in Yiddish whether he could help him. Oh\nyes, said, I need to go to Times Square, I don\u2019t know which train to take. And Sam\nsaid, well, I\u2019m going in the same direction, I\u20191l \u2014 Pll help you to get there. So they\ntake the train together, then Sam asked him, where are \u2014 when did you arrive? I\narrived yesterday. Where do you come from? I come from Toulouse. Really? So,\ncan I help you in any way? He said, well, [indecipherable] There 1s a man I have to\nlook up first. His name is Samuel Glasberg. Could you believe it? In New York, in\nthe subway of New York, yeah.",
        "Q: A fantastic story.",
        "A: Yeah, it is a fantastic story.",
        "Q: And you were also working though for [indecipherable] recipes?",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 yeah. You see, there \u2014 I mentioned before about the man who got stuck\nin Cuba, who had been for a few days, for a few va \u2014 months, a member of our\n[indecipherable]. I never met his wife, but the very evening when we arrived in\nNew York and went to the family where I told you the young man who comes still,\nwho is now 80 years old, he got stuck in Cuba. His wife, I don\u2019t know by what\nmeans, you know, the information gets around fast. The very same evening, she\ncalled me at the house where were \u2014 landed. And said, Vera, we never met. But I\nknow that you arrived, and I know you. I\u2019m working for a amer \u2014 for a Russian\nlawyer, who heads an American affidavit committee for people for Russian refugees\n\u2014 not refugees, for Russian \u2014 how should I say it, call it? Intellectuals who are stuck,\nwho have no families, and need to get out of Europe. She didn\u2019t ask me if I was\ninterested, she told me, tomorrow I come to meet you, I\u2019m going introduce you to\nthis man, and you are taking over my job, because I need to go to Cuba, to my\nhusband. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. The next day I had the job. My job\nconsisted in visiting wealthy American families, rec \u2014 explaining to them that their\nresponsibility was only to sign the forms, that they are going to guarantee the\nfinances of the family. They \u2014 and the promise, honest promise of the committee\nthat it will never have to do it actually, that it is just a formality. And fill out the\nforms for them.",
        "Q: Do you know how many families they succeeded in getting out of Europe that\nway?",
        "A: Oh, many, many. I worked there for a couple of years, many. Yes, I cannot give\nyou the number really, but many. I would say in the dozens, yeah. Yes, people were\n\u2014 were very \u2014 there were people who were \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 maybe not now, or\nmaybe some other later, didn\u2019t work. But most people, when they heard that it is a\nbeautiful [indecipherable]. It was not I who was the \u2014 it is my boss, of course, who\nwas the man of standing, whose word guaranteed, you know, he \u2014 he was a\u2014 a \u2014\nAlexis(ph) Goldenweiser(ph) was his name. He was a Russian lawyer, a man of\nvery high standing. And it was wonderful to work for him, wonderful.",
        "Q: How long did that job last?",
        "A: Until my daughter was born. Yeah, and even after she was born, we were n \u2014\nliving not far from each other, I would go and pick up work and I had a\u2014a\ntypewriter at home, and continued working.",
        "Q: So they were able to get people out throughout the whole war?",
        "A: I\u2014I would say so, yeah.",
        "Q: It \u2014 before we end \u2014 at what point, once you\u2019re living in the United States, did\nthe full horrors of what was going on in Europe become apparent? You left France\nbefore the Germans took over at Vichy.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "Q: So, when did the information come to you? Do you remember that moment?",
        "A: I must say that the \u2014 the beginning of it, I\u2014 I was unable to believe it, like\neverybody else. It was so atrocious and so unthinkable. How can you believe these\nthings? One thought it 1s \u2014 it is, you know, that people were going mad, and \u2014 but\nwhen, I cannot describe it. Like everybody else. It was horrible to \u2014 to \u2014 to even\nthink.",
        "Q: And Sam, was he able to correspond with his father at all?",
        "A: Unfortunately, very soon he \u2014 he was not hearing from him any more. He didn\u2019t\nwant to leave Poland, couldn\u2019t. His mother was no longer alive, and he was a very\ngood son. But it became impossible to correspond, yeah. And there again, you see,\nit\u2019s only then for me it became interesting to learn more about Judaism, about \u2014 we\ndiscussed many things before we got married, and it was, by the way, it was\nunderstood that the Jewish education was in Sam\u2019s hands. And what can I say? It\u2019s\n\u2014 it was a \u2014 again, a period in a different way, which was so happy in my life. My \u2014\nmy husband, who was wonderful. My children who were my \u2014 my greatest wish to\nhave. And the difficulties didn\u2019t mean anything. The \u2014 the \u2014 the baby difficults. We\ndidn\u2019t even have a phone in the house. When I needed a doctor I had to go nine\nfloors down and send call from the general phone, but he never could call me back\nif he was busy. It didn\u2019t matter. I had to wash the diapers by my \u2014 by hands and dry\nthem on the roof. Didn\u2019t matter. It was wonderful, wonderful time. And then they\nad \u2014 ha \u2014 on the other hand, also I was \u2014 there was a time when I didn\u2019t know\nwhether my parents are dead or alive. Imagine the joy to know that they are there.",
        "Q: Before we conclude things, why don\u2019t you just describe the day your parents\narrived in the United States?",
        "A: Oh, I must say, my mother arrived, she \u2014 when she arrived \u2014 when they arrived,\nshe was 56 years old, still a young woman. To me she looked an elderly lady. She\nwas well dressed, she had \u2014 yeah, I must tell you that before coming to the United\nStates, my parents returned to Belgium to say farewell. And that was the president\nof the touring club who kept some precious pieces that they brought out of Russia,\nin his house, and another friend of mine. And so they wanted to bring it with them\nfor my household. And now I have given all these beautiful pieces to my children,\nto Vic, and now my daughter who was here took the last, that I gave her a beautiful\nsilver tray. And I think that my mother, all this she carried, although I don\u2019t know\nhow she managed to bring it out, and my father. So, to me she seemed an elderly \u2014\nmy goodness, can you imagine? That is the age [indecipherable] older than my\ndaughter. So, I never thought that I will live that long, of course. And \u2014 but she\nlooked wonderful and we were, of course, very moved. And, I must say, from one\nday to another, you know, we became a family of six. I had to go to \u2014 back to work.\nMy mother took over the household, the two children. It is amazing. When I think\nback now, I don\u2019t know how she did it. She handled everything with again, with\ngrace. Never complained, never. And neither did my father. They did what they\ncould, the best they could, somehow succeeded and never complained. That\u2019s one\nthing I learned from them, not to complain.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a wonderful lesson in life",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And I think with that, this will conclude our interview for the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum with Vera Glasberg, and I want to thank you.",

        "Answer: Well, I was born in Riga, which at the time of my birth, which is 1912,\nwas still Russia. It 1s today an independent country, Latvia. I don\u2019t remember Riga\nat all because my parents moved to Kiev, which then was also Russia, became later\nUkraine, when I was about one year old. Av \u2014 we\u2019ll th \u2014 Kiev I remember very\nwell. We lived at a beautiful home, and a big courtyard, and it was a \u2014 a \u2014 a sizable\napartment. When \u2014 in 1917, when the revolution broke out, and the \u2014 the\ncommunists were \u2014 how should I say \u2014 assigning free rooms and apartments to their\nmembers, my parents decided to rent their apartment themselves. And there was an\nItalian lady who was a harpist in the Russian opera house, and her little girl \u2014 her\nlittle daughter was my playmate. And I have very good seven years from that time.\nThe theater gave sometimes operas for children, like Sad Sultan, or The Cock\nDoor, and The Golden Cockerel. And through this, the mother of my little friend\nAnnata(ph), we sometimes got seats to go and see these operas. In addition, she\nwas getting ballet dances \u2014 lessons, and so I got them myself also; my parents\nthought it would be a good idea. It was a wonderful time for me as a child. For my\nparents it was much more difficult because there were shortages of all kinds. My\nfather was arrested once for no reason except that he was a capitalist. And\nfortunately he was released twice when he was arrested. But in the meantime, there\nwas, for instance, no water. And my mother had sometimes to go in the middle of\nthe night when it was announced that there was some water somewhere in another\nquarter. And she would carry \u2014 come home carrying two pails of water for \u2014 for\nfood and for washing. I was not aware of all these hardships. But after he \u2014 my\nfather was released for the second time from prison, he said, no more, I want out. I\nwon't stay.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s where he got a \u2014 and a-\u2014 kind of a \u2014 edificial assignment to go for a\njob which was a \u2014 a fake job, to Riga for two years. That\u2019s why he was \u2014 we were\nable to leave the country legally. He could take his family, and take belongings\nnecessary for a two year stay. However, the trip was most unusual. We were\ntraveling in a train with cattle cars. We were sitting on the floor. We were part of a\ngroup of, if I recall, three or four families, which little \u2014 we all had little stoves,\nkerosene little stoves. The train would stop every once 1n awhile in the middle of\nthe field that \u2014 that was \u2014 that \u2014 [break]",
        "A: The rail car was a cattle car, there were no seats. We were sitting on the floor, on\nhay, or whatever it was. And it was very primitive. The tri \u2014 the trip must have\ntaken at least a week, if not more. And it would stop \u2014 the train would stop in the\nmiddle of the field, and we were all \u2014 were sucha \u2014 su \u2014 you know, supposed to get\nout to refresh ourselves with the snow, it was in winter, in January. We had little\nkerosene stoves. We made water out of the snow for tea. Everybody had,\napparently, food with us. I don\u2019t have any recollection of being \u2014 of famine. But it\nwas extremely primitive and I thought it the most exciting adventure you can think\nof. So, all my recollections of that time, which for \u2014 for adults were very taxing, for\nme were great fun. In Riga we had family. My mother \u2014 my mother\u2019s uncle was a\npsychiatrist who had a mental institution, which was the institution of the city. And\n\u2014 but we were not permitted \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 I speak of me as a child \u2014 to even go\nnear it. The house where the family lived was in a big \u2014 how should I say it \u2014 estate,\ncompletely separated, and that was where the family lived. Couldn\u2019t see it at the\ninstitution, even though the \u2014 the windows. And then again, there was one of the\nwomen who was helping in the household, had a daughter Ludiczka(ph). And\nLudiczka(ph) was my playmate, again I had one friend, I never missed friends. So,\nI had a wonderful time. We stayed there until spring, and after \u2014 after that, my \u2014 my\nuncle on my father\u2019s side, had in Finland \u2014 also, he was a wealthy man, had a big\nestate in Finland, and the whole family of the Hessens(ph), which is my maiden\nname, were reunited there on the \u2014 on the farm. There there were chickens and two\nhorses. I was sometimes permitted to go on the chariot with the \u2014 with the horseman\nto bring somebody to the train station through the woods. It was wonderful. There\nwas a lake, and one of my cousins was a little older than I was, and he was my\nplaymate, and we went fishing in the lake and canoeing, and so forth.",
        "A: No, it \u2014 we were invited, we were the guests for the summertime. And then my\nfather went to Danzig where the same brother had the insurance company of the\nfleet on the Volga. You see the \u2014 it was the \u2014 well, see family and my father\ndirected the office in Danzig. My mother and I went \u2014 stayed in Berlin, because\nfirst we \u2014 the whole family went to Berlin and my father left. And my mother and I\nstayed. We had rented a room in the apartment of a theater critic. And he always \u2014\nhis wife was not in good health, and he used to always to take my mother to first\nshows in the theaters in Berlin, which at the time, in the 20s at that time, was in full\nswing. And I was attended \u2014 was in \u2014 registered for the first time in my life to a\nschool, because until then I was home tutored, both in Russia and in \u2014 in Riga,\nalways I had home tutors.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Until then it was no problem. It was always something exciting, new and\nwonderful. For the first deception for me was when we left Berlin and joined my\nfather in dan \u2014 in Sopot, which 1s a little town, a sea resort actually, attendant to\nDanzig. It is the distance like from Alexandria, Virginia to Washington, D.C. It is\njust attendant, but it is on the North Sea and a \u2014 a sea resort by the next \u2014 Poland,\nwhich 1s practically next door. So, during the summer season it was invaded by the\nPolish [indecipherable] community which came to play in the cansino(ph) and so\nforth. But I went to a German lyc\u00e9e, which was a good school, but I hated it,\nbecause after the Russian school, which was on a very high level, the faculty was\nthe cream cup of faculty from Russia, \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Russia, whereas here there\nwere \u2014 how should I define it? Only women, only old spinsters, anti-Semitic,\nunfriendly. Very resenting the \u2014 the \u2014 the additions that came, and made probably\ntheir job difficult, because my German was practically nil. And my marks at the\nbeginning were awful. I didn\u2019t learn German grammar, it was terrible. I had to write\na composition, it was full of mistakes. It took me time.",
        "A: Yeah, of course.",
        "A: They went a \u2014",
        "A: That they were to begin with. That \u2014 because to there at that time already many\nrefugees from Russia who got kind of squeezed in there. And they were \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t like \u2014 it was a different culture. They were very narrow-minded, they were\nvery \u2014 you know, like little towns. Whereas Russia, from Russia people came from\nSaint Petersburg, from Kiev, from Moscow. It was a different type of families.",
        "A: Well, you know, at that age, you just suffer.",
        "A: What can you do, you don\u2019t have to revolt. However, you know, there too we\nhad nice times. I made friends with \u2014 with these people from Russia, of course. And\nwe went in \u2014 for instance once, to make an experience, and to write a note in several\nlanguages, which we got together, and put the \u2014 the note, with my address because\nth \u2014 I had invented that, so ha-happens, in a bottle. We sealed it and we threw the\nbottle into the sea, and later completely forgot about it, even though a few months\nlater we got a real \u2014 an answer from somebo \u2014 students in Sweden.",
        "A: They wrote in \u2014 I \u20141f I remember correctly, in German. Broken German. And\nthey offered to correspond before we get together, but our parents, our common\nparents said to us, it\u2019s na \u2014 not a good idea, because they were students already, 19\nyears old, we were 12. So \u2014 so it was not the thing to do. And we obeyed. There\nwas no revolt. Parents said, that was it. But it \u2014 it was a nice \u2014 it was a nice time. I\nhad man \u2014 lifelong friends from that time. We had competitions who would be the fi\n\u2014 the first one would g \u2014 win who will go and take the first cold swim in the spring,\nand without interruption until the fall. You see, children\u2019s play, it was a good time.\nAnd yeah, I lived there for \u2014 yeah, I would say for almost five years.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Although, at \u2014 by that time \u2014 by that time we were no longer\nofficially Russians, because we never got back, as it was understood. So we loos \u2014\nlost the citizenship. We were at that point citizens of no country. We didn\u2019t belong,\nwe had no protection from any country. And a member of the then League of\nNations, by the name of Nansen(ph) has created for people like my family, a\nspecial document which was called the Nansen(ph) passport, which was not \u2014\ndidn\u2019t look like a passport of a regular country, which was a sheet of paper with\nsome name, date of birth, indication \u2014 all the information that the passport has. But\nthat was our passport, and forever gave us trouble, because usually the people at the\ncasa \u2014 the borders had never seen such documents.",
        "A: Yeah, I was telling you that we were \u2014 we had to go through Poland in sealed\ncars. And wherever later we moved from Sopot finally, the \u2014 the \u2014 the\n[indecipherable] the Volga, I don\u2019t \u2014 I cannot tell you what exactly happened,\neither the office closed or my father had no other possibilities. He was offered a job\nin Brussels, in Belgium. A job which \u2014 my father had two doctorates, he was an\nengineer from Belgium and he had a doctorate of mathematics from Saint\nPetersburg, with a gold medal. But he accepted the job to sell off used cars in \u2014 in\nBelgium, just to show you that permutation saved their lives. They never\ncomplained, never.",
        "A: Well, I was elated pa \u2014 by that time I was 17. And to \u2014 leaving this Sopot, this\nsmall town and go to Brussels, the capital of Belgium in the west, it was very\nexciting. I was 17, but I still had to switch school because I didn't finish the lyc\u00e9e. I\nhad two \u2014 the aptitude to make [indecipherable]. I had to have the pre \u2014\nuntaprima(ph) and dobaprima(ph). And each time I had to change languages;\nfrom Russian first to German; from German then to French. The French that I have\nlearned in school was nothing. So \u2014 well, we arrived in Belgium, and what can I\nsay? Very soon after my father arrived there, maybe a year, the \u2014 the \u2014 the garage\nwith the used car collapsed. Well, by that time, when I finished the lyc\u00e9e, which\ncorresponds years \u2014 to two years of college, the [indecipherable] is bachot, French\nbachot you know what that means?",
        "A: It is a different organization of schools. I knew that I had to help the \u2014 with \u2014 the\nfamily with finances. So I registered in a business school and I decided I\u2019m going to\ncontinue my education at this first opportunity, and did it throughout my life. I went\nto business school for six months. By that time it was summer, and one luxury that\nmy mother permitted herself, was to once a year to go to Riga to visit her mother.\nSo while she was away, it so happened that the t-touring club of Belgium, which is\nlike the ma \u2014 automobile association here, was looking for somebody for a member\nof their staff. And they usually request that somebo \u2014 to send them somebody the\nbusiness school where \u2014 that I was attending. And before I even had finished it, the\ndirector of the school picked me to ask me if I was interested. Was I interested? Of\ncourse. So I have \u2014 was very proud that I got the job before my mother came home.\nSo that was my lengthy period in Brussels, until May 10\", 1940.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 it \u2014 it was \u2014 it was \u2014 how should I say? Nobody could imagine what\ncould d \u2014 that something of that caliber could ever happen to begin with. On the\nother hand, I must also confess, to my shame, that at that time I was a very \u2014 how\nshould I say \u2014 carefree, cheerful, a little bit superficial girl who loved dancing, who\nloved friendships, excursions. Politics were not my strength. My husband, if I had\nmet him that \u2014 that area, we would have never seen each other again, because he\nwas very much involved in politics. He was active in the labor Zionist movement,\nvery active. So, it is funny, we lived in the same town for 10 years, both of us, had\nmany common friends, and never met.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That day \u2014 that day was a sunny, beautiful morning and we r \u2014 I remember\nwaking up and couldn't understand. I thought that 1t was a thunderstorm. And the \u2014\nhow is possible, the skis \u2014 sky is blue. And all these explosions, c-could it be a\nthunderstorm? So, it\u2019s \u2014 it was very strange. But then of course, word came out\nimmediately. I went to work, everybody went to work, and for us, very soon people\nstarted \u2014 as soon as people understood that it is the Germans who are invading,\nthose who had cars and funds, started moving, moving south.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: Not at all because we had no means \u2014 the little means that we had, it is only very\nrecently before the invasion that we moved to our own apartment, we used to have\nrented rooms before, at our house. My parents lived in the attic and I lived in the\nlittle \u2014 small, little attendant room downstairs, it was very \u2014 really, it was my\nmother who managed everything remarkably well. They shared the kitchen, we\nshared the bathroom. It was very, very difficult life for them, and again, not very\nmuch for me. For me it was all a very easy going \u2014 so, what I was going to say that\nthe big expense that we have made the \u2014 before May 10\", maybe before the one\nMay fifth, is to buy a\u2014I cannot say a refrigerator because it was not electric. It was\na cold box, you know, with pieces of ice. And here if the war breaks out, the day\nwhen that ice thing was delivered. So \u2014 but, I must say that the president of the\ntouring club, who was an unusual person, told me, because one, I was a fit \u2014 I think\nI was the only Jewish person in the staff \u2014 don\u2019t stay. Whether you have means or\nnot, take what you can carry and leave. Take the first train and go south. Go to\nParis and see what you can do later. And what he said was \u2014 was very meaningful\nto my parents, too. So, after two or three days, that\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: Yes, because after \u2014 when we were almost at the French border, there was a\nbombardment at night, and they broke the rails, the train couldn\u2019t continue. It so\nhappened the train had stopped at the station, so we left the \u2014 the one or two\nsuitcases that we had at the station, and continued on foot, going south.",
        "A: A handbag, just a handbag.",
        "A: Yeah, clothes on the back and the little te \u2014 suitcase. Strangely enough \u2014 fate 1s\nstrange \u2014 we met good friends of ours, and the wife of \u2014 it was actually a friend of\nmy husband, but I knew her vaguely, too. She had the French passport, she was of\nFrench origin, and there was a train forming, but only for French citizens. So here\nshe was, Mimi was her name, Mimi was running to the train and waving her\npassport. Her husband and the three of us, my parents and I after her, and then\nnobody checked the documents or tickets, nothing. In the car \u2014 again a cattle car.\nAgain that\u2019s everything closed, totally dark. Was crazy.",
        "A: The train took us to Paris, and there we were welcomed by the Red Cross with\ncoffee, the Germans will never get here, you\u2019re welcome, blah, blah, blah. So there\nwe separated from our friends, and we ha \u2014 we had family, my father had family in\nParis. So \u2014 but of course, we couldn\u2019t stay there, we stayed overnight, but they\ncouldn\u2019t put up three people. And that was announced that people who can support\nthemselves can take a train that will be forming the next day. One will be going to\nToulouse, and the other to Bordeaux, south. By mere chance, we chose Toulouse.",
        "A: Toulouse. It is called la ville de violette. The violet city. It is charming, but\nactually, it is an industrial city. The \u2014 there is a \u2014 an enormous factory for airplanes.\nThis enormous new airplane, this monster is being built there, 1s being finished\nthere. But it has a certain charm, and some cultural life, certain interesting things\nthat we couldn\u2019t think about that very much. And we met some friends from \u2014 from\nBrussels. Nobody wa \u2014 knew where to go, nobody had means to go to a hotel. We\nbought a paper and saw that there was a house for rent, an empty house for rent, and\nwe decided to \u2014 to get \u2014 to pull together and rent this house and live there as a\ncommunity.",
        "A: These friends were two Russian families. One [indecipherable] I mean, the \u2014\nthe adults of that family are already gone, but the s \u2014 one of the sons of our friends,\nwho was 14 year olds when I got married finally, in this house, visits me here now.\nHe is an 80 year old friend, and I have known him, of course, forever. And another\nfamily. So \u2014 and we \u2014 it was well organized. We made a whole government there,\nthere was a so-called president. My father was the minister of agriculture, because it\nwas a little garden that we planted vegetables.",
        "A: There was a foreign minister, was running every day to all the consulates to find\nout where you can leave again, because at that time that part of France was not\noccupied, was free. But you never know. And it was later. Then there was a\nminister of the interior, that was my mother, who was in charge of the household.\nShe int \u2014 the \u2014 the mother of this young man I just described and [indecipherable]\nminister interior, then \u2014 then there was the young generation, the supplies, because\nwe had to run around and find supplies, as I told you. There was no butter, there\nwas no milk, there was \u2014 as time progressed, very difficult.",
        "A: Oh, my goodness. Word came around that there is such a community that exists\nand there were forever people appearing at the door. Some people some people\nknew, and some people who didn\u2019t know anybody, we just heard about it. And there\nwere always a meal, and there were always a shelter overnight. Some stayed for one\nnight, some stayed for a week. Some stayed when they had further visas, some\nothers not. It was amazing.",
        "A: Well, as I say, everybody contributed, energy, effort, and knowl \u2014 not everybody\ndid everything. Everybody had their decided needs. I-I had a friend, this young man\nAndr\u00e9 would lend me his bicycle, and we would go to the country and buy some\neggs here, and a little, I don\u2019t know, cream there, or cr\u00e9me fraiche, or something\nlike that. And the younger ones, after dinner did the dishes. The low \u2014 the ladies \u2014\nthe mothers were cooking, and the younger generation did the dishes.",
        "A: No, there were \u2014 there were, as I say, there were \u2014 they didn\u2019t mind. There was \u2014\nafter all, we were contributing in a way to the \u2014 to the life of the city by buying, and\nbehaving, and it was paying the rent and so forth. So \u2014 and then people, by and by,\nbegan to leave. And that\u2019s how very good friends of ours who came \u2014 who came to\n\u2014 to \u2014 to say goodbye, brang s \u2014 brought some [indecipherable] just said, we\u2019re\ngoing to go to a house, there were go \u2014 a house of nice peoples, come along. But\nthat particular time I didn\u2019t pay much attention to Sam, because the president of the\ntouring club of Belgium also arrived in the [indecipherable] because he was\nlooking for his son who was a colonel in the Belgian Army. And he had learned that\nin Montpelier, which is halfway between Toulouse and Marseilles, there were lists\nof Belgian officers. And he asked me to come along with him. He \u2014 I think my\nparents would have let me only with Colonel Mitey(ph) to \u2014 to leave Toulouse by\ntrain, but he had the diplomatic passport, and then my [indecipherable] passport\npicture is \u2014 was [indecipherable] that I was secretary of so and so. So I could\nalways travel with him without effort, without difficulties.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, I was running somewhere and I met Sam in the street, and we stopped and\nchatted for a minute. And he asked me if I happened to be free the next day, that he\nis going to visit some friends, and they\u2019re going to make music to play, and he was\ngoing to sing. And to me it sounded as if he asked me to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, to fly to\nMars, because everybody asking only in which consulate that you go. And so that\nwas nice. And then he told me about the plans to organize this farm, this kibbutz.",
        "A: Well, the farm, he got funds from the labor Zionists to rent a \u2014 all this was his\nidea, he rented an old castle, was rather dilapidated. But it was beautiful, it was a\ncastle, really, and surrounding grounds with woods and plains. And enough funds to\nhave some cattle, goats and cows, and a horse, and what else? Chickens galore and\nturkey, you name it. And mostly his idea was just because the soldiers that I told\nyou were gone, people who had no means of support and were \u2014 I mean, they were\nnot mishandled in any way, but they were not free, in Gurs. You know what Gurs\nIS.",
        "A: They came to work on the farm.",
        "A: Because he announced in Gurs that there are \u2014 there are jobs needed on \u2014 on \u2014 in\nGaillard. That there 1s a means \u2014 there is \u2014 they planted \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember what they planted. I was only paperwork worker. I occasionally visited\nthere after that, of course, but that was at \u2014 about 20 miles from \u2014 from Toulouse,\nnot far. And \u2014 and so it was to everybody\u2019s satisfaction that Sam was terrific, he\nalways knew how to \u2014 people are tired, worked very hard, there was not much food.\nBut still, they \u2014 they knew it\u2019s a matter of life and death, literally, because you\nknow, you never know what happens tomorrow. In fact, it did happen finally, they\nwere occupied.",
        "A: After we left?",
        "A: Yeah, they became a center of resistance, yeah. They were \u2014 they were \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were good people, yeah.",
        "A: No, they were not \u2014 there were some German, there were some Polish. There\nwere some that were still from Belgium also. There were not so many. There would\nbe \u2014 I would guess that there was maybe 25 - 30 people, not more. Some of them\nSam knew personally, Sam, he was \u2014 he was reading the references and so he\nwanted \u2014 he wanted a homogenous group and not quarrels and you know \u2014 and it\nworked. It really did.",
        "A: What they were doing?",
        "A: They were collapsing to sleep, I assure you.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know \u2014 there was no television, and there was no \u2014 but, you see, I\nremember one evening at \u2014 that sticks always in my memory. The winter was\napproaching and needed wood for \u2014 for heating and for cooking and for ever, and it\nwas low. It had to be done, there was no time during the day, and after dinner\neverybody was tired. So Sam, already at the dinnertime, he began saying \u2014 hello\nBecca.\nR: Hi Nana.",
        "A: This is my granddaughter Rebecca.\nR: Hi, nice to meet you.",
        "A: You don\u2019t mind?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: So, he said, look, it\u2019s nice evening, let\u2019s go out, make a tour and sing. Take a\nlong some \u2014 how do you call it, the \u2014",
        "A: Axes. We went out singing, and on the way with axes, came back with tons of\nwood, and everybody was a good mood, exhausted and tired, still did.",
        "A: Well, at the beginning we needed a lot of permissions forms and all that. And\nonce the farm was organized, there was no need for it, you see. So it was \u2014 it was \u2014\nit was functioning very well. And if occasionally there was a need for a letter that\nwas \u2014 he became friends with the mayor \u2014 who married us, by the way \u2014 the mayor\nof that little village, was called Grenard(ph). And he \u2014 at that time there was no \u2014\nno gas, and nobody had a car except the \u2014 the personalities. So the mayor rent us his\ncar to drive from Deymarie(ph) to the Chateau de Gaillard. And my parents and\nthe witnesses followed all in a horse pulled cart \u2014 cattle.",
        "A: Well, I came to visit Sam in Gaillard for \u2014 over the new year. And that\u2019s when\nhe gave me the ring that had belonged to his mother, because nobody bought any\ngowns or rings or any things of that sort. And that ring has an interesting story.\nMuch, much later, when this young lady was getting married, I decided to give her\nthe ring of my husband\u2019s mother. And to my horror, I had been away, it had been\nstolen. I had a break-in in my house. But we worked it out anyway, there was\nanother ring. So \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: I went \u2014 I went to Gaillard over \u2014 yeah, overnight, and you see, later the ladies\ntold me \u2014 the ladies of [indecipherable] told me they [indecipherable] and to the\nbig fancy hall in the gi \u2014 1n the castle, which had been the bull hall, because it had\ntapestries, they were moth-eaten, but they were beautiful tapestries. He went in\nthere, he said, that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to get married. I didn\u2019t even know it.",
        "A: I have only good remembrance of that time. I really have nothing sad, where it\nwas so difficult for most people, and I must say [music playing] there goes my\nphone. Becca, do you \u2014 can you give it to me. Excuse \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 occasionally, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: So, the f\u2014 we had two wedding days. The first was a civil wedding in this\nvillage of Grenard(ph). As I said, the mayor married us, and he \u2014 heh-heh \u2014 that is\nvery French, he said, in our country, the one who married has the first kiss. So he\nembraced me. And, as I say, he lent us his motorcar. We were like princes of - Sam\nand I. And my parents and my witnesses followed in a horse drawn \u2014 how do you\ncall it, the place when you put in hay? They were sitting \u2014 it was not for people,\nthey didn\u2019t need that for people.",
        "A: Wagon, yeah. Anyway, we arrived in \u2014 and then there was a festive reception in\nGaillard, and we had chickens and the ducks and the goats, little goats, all that\nmixing with the people in the reception. It was most unusual. And then, the next day\nwe had a re \u2014 a religious wedding from a rabbi who came to the house to be\n[indecipherable] and married us there. And I think in the book there is a\nphotograph of it, where all the people who at that time were in the [indecipherable]\nmany more came. And they made it wonderful, and for those times, that was a\ndinner, that was a feast. So \u2014 and yeah, now, the only thing was, I had no clothes.\nThe wedding was in the same suit that I wore coming from Brussels. On the road,\nin the trains, everywhere. But for the wedding at home, I had to wear something a\nlittle more presentable, but I didn\u2019t have any. So a friend of mine happened to pass\nby, and we had similar figures, she lent me a dress.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because since we were going to leave the following \u2014 and \u2014 and very\nsoon, I wanted to stay with my parents. And Sam returned to the farm. So we saw\neach other for weekends here and there, but I didn\u2019t want to go and live on the farm.",
        "A: He had a visa to get out when I met him, from Rabbi stat \u2014 Stephen Weiss.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so. But he knew of Sam because he worked very \u2014\nwas very active in the labor Zionist organization in Belgium. So Sam had this visa\n\u2014 he, as a matter of fact, had already used the entrance to Palestine, but he had\ngiven it to somebody else. My children ask me sometimes, why didn\u2019t he go to\nPalestine, why did he go to the United States? I cannot answer that, I don\u2019t know.\nHe probably had reasons for it. One though that comes to my mind 1s that his\nparents were alive. His father, rather. His mother was already gone. And he was \u2014\nhe was \u2014 he needed support, financial support, and that, of course, was not possible\nfrom Palestine, because people went there to dig roads, and to build. And Sam\nwanted to get a job and su-support his father, and that\u2019s what he did.",
        "A: So -",
        "A: Well, that was the interesting thing. We both went to Marseille from the\nhoneymoon, to extend the visa for two. And the American consul asked us, do you\nwant a tourist visa or an immigration visa? Who cares? You know, is that we\u2019ll\ncome back to Europe anyway after the war is over tomorrow afternoon. Whatever\nyou give us, we\u2019ll be grateful. And this man did something that I much later\nunderstood. He was forbidden to give out immigration visas, and he did, he gave us\none.",
        "A: I never knew, f\u2014 and you know, I don\u2019t remember the name. I wish that it \u2014\nbecause I understand that some of them were \u2014 there were several consuls who were\ndoing it, and they were demoted. And somebody told me even that one of them a\nstamp was done in his honor, because he really was deported or fired altogether\nbecause he helped so many Jews to escape.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. No crowds, no. Be right there [indecipherable] no, because people\nwere dying to get a visa, but you could only get one if you had the permission to get\nout of France, and proof that you have visas to get through the countries you have\nto get \u2014 to get there. Which on the other one \u2014 on the other hand, were difficult to\nget without the v \u2014 end visa.",
        "A: Well, you see, some \u2014 some people got stuck on the way, like for instance in\nCuba. We know a friend who s \u2014 well, got stuck in Cuba. Couldn\u2019t \u2014 had to wait \u2014\nwaiting for the American visa. We had no problem once we had to prove that the\nemergency visa was official. We got \u2014 we went through Spain and Portugal and\ntook a boat to Lisbon.",
        "A: We sure did, we sure did. Well, we left \u2014 we left early August, I think. It was \u2014 it\nwas very difficult for me to leave, although the arrangement was that Sam and I\nwould go \u2014 we had no money, practically no money, and the trip was paid by the\nHIAS [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, he said [indecipherable] HIAS would takes\ncare, but it was paid for us. And we would get organized and a year later my parents\nwere to join us in the States. We left in 41, in August \u201941, they were to come in\n\"42.",
        "A: No. But once we were there, there was, you know, we were 1n the States, there\nshould be no problem in finding, you know, for parents to join, close relatives that\nwould have been no more. And that\u2019s what happened, eventually. I went to\nWashington for an affidavit, got it right away.",
        "A: Well, yeah \u2014",
        "A: We left by train. There were friends on the way, in the mountains, near Po(ph),\nwhich is near the Spanish border. We had some friends who came out to see the\ntrain pass and wave to us. They couldn\u2019t see us, of course, but we saw them. On the\ntrain we met a Spaniard, a charming fellow. We are going to spend a night in\nMadrid. When he heard that we were s-stopping \u2014 he was coming back after the\ntour or army, he said, I\u2019m going to show you Madrid, and took us \u2014 he went home,\ntook a shower and s \u2014 kissed his wife and came out again, met us at the hotel and\ntook us around in Madrid. It was really very nice, yeah. So \u2014 but the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe real event was at the border between Spain and Lisbon, because that was\nactually for the first time entering the freedom, because Lisbon, Portugal was a\nneutral country. Spain was still fascist, 1t was still allied of Germany, but Portugal\nwas free. So, this is the last border, entrance into freedom. They took our luggage,\nand made us open the luggage and took our passports. The train 1s about to leave in\ntwo minutes, everything is ready, we were going to have some sandwich and relax.\nEnters the official and says, lady, off the train. What? My husband can continue, but\nI have to get off. So Sam told me it makes no sense for us both to stick here. I will\ngo, and there\u2019s only one train a day \u2014",
        "A: The next day. The next day. And one train a day. That he told me, call the\n[indecipherable] immediately, call the police, call whoever you can do, you will\ncome tomorrow.",
        "A: They took me off the train because as Sam\u2019s wife, I was listed as a Polish\ncitizen, and I had the Nansen(ph) pass that they never seen in their life. Something\nwas not right, and during wartime, you don\u2019t play. And there was no time to make\ndecisions or make calls. So here was the train leaving with my newly wedded\nhusband, and the ship leaving the next day. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember crying, but I\nmust have been because later I realized that my cheeks were wet. And the same\nofficial came and said, don\u2019t cry. Let him go. You\u2019ll get married, you\u2019ll stay here.\nHe was actually very nice.",
        "A: I did call the [indecipherable] and they \u2014 and when Sam arrived they\nstraightened it out, the matter of \u2014 of the papers. And I took the next train, Sam met\nme at the station. We took a taxi, which was a luxury, but I needed inoculation for\nsmallpox. And we literally got to the boat 50 minutes before they put up \u2014 pulled up\nthe planks, yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: On the ship we had better luck. I see you remember and you know. Yes, it was\namazing. The \u2014 the leader of the [indecipherable] group to \u2014 which had paid our\npassage, Sam introduced him to me. And he came back and asked me if I knew how\nto type. Well, I was deep in thoughts about leaving my parents and the whole\ncountry and the continent of Europe, and that was very advantageous because they\ndoubled \u2014 that would double our fortune; 25 dollars in those years was like 250\nnow. And \u2014 and we were to eat in first class. And I, without my husband, would\nshare the \u2014 a stateroom with another lady, and he was in the hold, where we were\nsupposed to stay.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t mind. So that\u2019s what happened, tha-that was fun too, because they\nwere very nice Portuguese officers, nice, friendly, handsome. And I was working\nthree hours a day, and people on \u2014 on \u2014 on the ship saw that I was member of the\nstaff. So that was great fun. And we arrived in Staten Island on September 2\",\n1940, Labor Day. And the ship stood in the \u2014 in the harbor, they didn\u2019t take us on\nboard because it was Labor Day. And you see those lights of Manhattan, it was\ngorgeous. So it went.",
        "A: Yes, because my mother was working for the Swiss Red Cross, we were able to\ncorrespond through the Red Cross [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, the beginning. I would say maybe for \u2014 for half of the time, if at all. Maybe\nfive, six months. But they were saying months, years, couple of years. About half of\nthe time we were separated was \u2014 was actually fifti \u2014 yeah, five years. My parents\narrived by the first commercial crossing after the war had ended.",
        "A: That was interesting. My mother met in the street an American soldier, and\nasked him to send me a note from them by \u2014 how is it called, the American special\nway for the soldiers? Do you know what that 1\u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah, APO mail. So I got one day a letter from the soldier, with regards from\nmy parents. Was fantastic, because th-the \u2014 the regular mail didn\u2019t work yet.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s strange. They never liked to talk about it. All I know, that they\nwent underground. All I know that they had false papers. All I know that they were\nat the beginning hidden by a family where I had the \u2014 the gall to tutor a woman in\nEnglish, who kind of took a liking to me and with my imperfect knowledge, she\nsaid it was useful for her. So I was tutoring some people who were \u2014 wanted to\ncome to the States. And she helped out. I don\u2019t know much, but they survived. You\nknow, there were many French heroes who hid Jews. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No \u2014 yeah. Sam did it personally because h-he \u2014 he \u2014 during his work still in\nBrussel had many contacts here and there. And then there were the strangest\ncoincidences. One day \u2014 we lived then at the corner of Broadway and 110\" Street,\nhe came down into the subway and saw a man who was visibly just arrived, who\nwas kind of looking around a little bit lost. And he came up to him, he could see\nthat he was a Jew who arrived recently. You know, there are certain signs you\nrecognize. He came up and asked him in Yiddish whether he could help him. Oh\nyes, said, I need to go to Times Square, I don\u2019t know which train to take. And Sam\nsaid, well, I\u2019m going in the same direction, I\u20191l \u2014 Pll help you to get there. So they\ntake the train together, then Sam asked him, where are \u2014 when did you arrive? I\narrived yesterday. Where do you come from? I come from Toulouse. Really? So,\ncan I help you in any way? He said, well, [indecipherable] There 1s a man I have to\nlook up first. His name is Samuel Glasberg. Could you believe it? In New York, in\nthe subway of New York, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it is a fantastic story.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 yeah. You see, there \u2014 I mentioned before about the man who got stuck\nin Cuba, who had been for a few days, for a few va \u2014 months, a member of our\n[indecipherable]. I never met his wife, but the very evening when we arrived in\nNew York and went to the family where I told you the young man who comes still,\nwho is now 80 years old, he got stuck in Cuba. His wife, I don\u2019t know by what\nmeans, you know, the information gets around fast. The very same evening, she\ncalled me at the house where were \u2014 landed. And said, Vera, we never met. But I\nknow that you arrived, and I know you. I\u2019m working for a amer \u2014 for a Russian\nlawyer, who heads an American affidavit committee for people for Russian refugees\n\u2014 not refugees, for Russian \u2014 how should I say it, call it? Intellectuals who are stuck,\nwho have no families, and need to get out of Europe. She didn\u2019t ask me if I was\ninterested, she told me, tomorrow I come to meet you, I\u2019m going introduce you to\nthis man, and you are taking over my job, because I need to go to Cuba, to my\nhusband. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. The next day I had the job. My job\nconsisted in visiting wealthy American families, rec \u2014 explaining to them that their\nresponsibility was only to sign the forms, that they are going to guarantee the\nfinances of the family. They \u2014 and the promise, honest promise of the committee\nthat it will never have to do it actually, that it is just a formality. And fill out the\nforms for them.",
        "A: Oh, many, many. I worked there for a couple of years, many. Yes, I cannot give\nyou the number really, but many. I would say in the dozens, yeah. Yes, people were\n\u2014 were very \u2014 there were people who were \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 maybe not now, or\nmaybe some other later, didn\u2019t work. But most people, when they heard that it is a\nbeautiful [indecipherable]. It was not I who was the \u2014 it is my boss, of course, who\nwas the man of standing, whose word guaranteed, you know, he \u2014 he was a\u2014 a \u2014\nAlexis(ph) Goldenweiser(ph) was his name. He was a Russian lawyer, a man of\nvery high standing. And it was wonderful to work for him, wonderful.",
        "A: Until my daughter was born. Yeah, and even after she was born, we were n \u2014\nliving not far from each other, I would go and pick up work and I had a\u2014a\ntypewriter at home, and continued working.",
        "A: I\u2014I would say so, yeah.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "A: I must say that the \u2014 the beginning of it, I\u2014 I was unable to believe it, like\neverybody else. It was so atrocious and so unthinkable. How can you believe these\nthings? One thought it 1s \u2014 it is, you know, that people were going mad, and \u2014 but\nwhen, I cannot describe it. Like everybody else. It was horrible to \u2014 to \u2014 to even\nthink.",
        "A: Unfortunately, very soon he \u2014 he was not hearing from him any more. He didn\u2019t\nwant to leave Poland, couldn\u2019t. His mother was no longer alive, and he was a very\ngood son. But it became impossible to correspond, yeah. And there again, you see,\nit\u2019s only then for me it became interesting to learn more about Judaism, about \u2014 we\ndiscussed many things before we got married, and it was, by the way, it was\nunderstood that the Jewish education was in Sam\u2019s hands. And what can I say? It\u2019s\n\u2014 it was a \u2014 again, a period in a different way, which was so happy in my life. My \u2014\nmy husband, who was wonderful. My children who were my \u2014 my greatest wish to\nhave. And the difficulties didn\u2019t mean anything. The \u2014 the \u2014 the baby difficults. We\ndidn\u2019t even have a phone in the house. When I needed a doctor I had to go nine\nfloors down and send call from the general phone, but he never could call me back\nif he was busy. It didn\u2019t matter. I had to wash the diapers by my \u2014 by hands and dry\nthem on the roof. Didn\u2019t matter. It was wonderful, wonderful time. And then they\nad \u2014 ha \u2014 on the other hand, also I was \u2014 there was a time when I didn\u2019t know\nwhether my parents are dead or alive. Imagine the joy to know that they are there.",
        "A: Oh, I must say, my mother arrived, she \u2014 when she arrived \u2014 when they arrived,\nshe was 56 years old, still a young woman. To me she looked an elderly lady. She\nwas well dressed, she had \u2014 yeah, I must tell you that before coming to the United\nStates, my parents returned to Belgium to say farewell. And that was the president\nof the touring club who kept some precious pieces that they brought out of Russia,\nin his house, and another friend of mine. And so they wanted to bring it with them\nfor my household. And now I have given all these beautiful pieces to my children,\nto Vic, and now my daughter who was here took the last, that I gave her a beautiful\nsilver tray. And I think that my mother, all this she carried, although I don\u2019t know\nhow she managed to bring it out, and my father. So, to me she seemed an elderly \u2014\nmy goodness, can you imagine? That is the age [indecipherable] older than my\ndaughter. So, I never thought that I will live that long, of course. And \u2014 but she\nlooked wonderful and we were, of course, very moved. And, I must say, from one\nday to another, you know, we became a family of six. I had to go to \u2014 back to work.\nMy mother took over the household, the two children. It is amazing. When I think\nback now, I don\u2019t know how she did it. She handled everything with again, with\ngrace. Never complained, never. And neither did my father. They did what they\ncould, the best they could, somehow succeeded and never complained. That\u2019s one\nthing I learned from them, not to complain.",
