        "Q: All right. Would you -- sorry about that. Would you tell me your name, full name, again,\nplease?",
        "A: My full name is Simone Marguerite Lipman. My maiden name was Weil -- W-E-I-L.\nSimone Weil.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was actually born in a very little village in Alsace, near Strasbourg. I was born on April\n22nd, 1920.",
        "Q: And what was the name of the village?",
        "A: The name of the village was Ringendorf. In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't\neven fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps, it had a Jewish community. It had a\nsynagogue which, of course, was destroyed during the war. And I -- the house in which I was\nborn is in shambles, but it's still there. My family moved to Strasbourg in -- when I was three\nyears old. My father was a sheep raiser, a very unusual kind of a profession for -- occupation\nfor a Jew. His father, whom I never knew, was a butcher. They're all family of Jewish\nbutchers, but he broke out of there, \u2018though he had barely, probably, a sixth grade education,\nand he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the east. So I grew up in\nStrasbourg, which was a vibrant, vibrant and dynamic, Jewish community. I have a brother --\nI should say, I had a brother, because he died some 14 years ago after loosing his son in the\nYom Kippur War in Israel. My brother was just a year younger than myself, and both of us\nwere very active in, in the Jewish youth movement, which were the Jewish scouting\nmovement, Les Eclaireurs Isra\u00e9lites de France.\u2019 Les \"EIF,\" as we called them.\nAnd I'm going to refer to them many times in this hour to come. I also got a very solid\nJewish education there -- very unusual for girls my age. I went to Talmud Torah all through\nmy high school, and was very active in things Jewish. And particularly, as I said, in the\nJewish youth movement, the scouts, where I was a leader and had leadership training. I went\ninto the lyc\u00e9e,\u201d like all kids my age. I got a good classical education, I suppose. In those\ndays, it was the typical classical education: studying Latin and Greek and philosophy,\nwhatever. But when I finished high school and got my baccalaureate in 1938, I wanted to\nbecome a physicist. But somehow I was talked out of it, because the writing was on the wall,\nand somehow was told that was not a thing to do for a Jewish girl, and that it would be better\nin -- to go into something more practical. And so I went into early childhood education, and\nI'm stuck. I mean, I never moved away from that. So I got one year of training, and that's all.\n' The Israeli Scouts of France (French).\n* French grammar or high school, funded by the State (French).\nBut already in 1938, while the Munich Agreements and the debates were going on, my\nparents sent me to safety with my grandmother -- then very close to 80. And I went\nsomewhere in the south of France with her for just a short period. Then things calmed down\nagain and I went back to Strasbourg. And we stayed in Strasbourg. By 19 -- by the end of the\nsummer 1939, of course, we knew war was coming. And again, I was shipped to the center\nof France with my grandmother. I was eighteen years old. But the safety of my grandmother\nwas utmost. That was my ma -- paternal grandmother, lived with us. And I was sent down\nsouth to take care of her.\nIn the meanwhile, Strasbourg, which was the most -- considered the most exposed city of\nFrance 1n spite of the Maginot Line -- was completely evacuated. All the population of\nStrasbourg was evacuated and sent down to the to the P\u00e9rigeaux, to the Department of the\nDordogne. But somehow, because my parents had their own private means, they did not join\nthe flow of refugees going down south and they went near Nancy, where they rented a house.\nNow, here I am south with my grandmother and -- when things settled down. But because\nyou had relatives, somehow it was they were able to get in touch with me. And so I returned\nto Blamont, where my parents were living, with my grandmother. And there we were\nwaiting for the war to finish. We had just with us whatever we needed. And when the winter\ncame, we needed some more clothes. And I remember to this day, going with a \"safe-\nconduct\" -- that what you call it? A \"sauf-conduit.\"\u201d And we went into Strasbourg, my\nbrother and I. It was a ghost town with just cats and dogs in there, and we got some winter\nclothes and went back to Blamont. In the meanwhile, I took a job in Paris, in, in a private\nschool, to -- because I had had some training in early childhood education. And I worked\nthere, while the bombs, the bombings were starting, and taught in the shelters, and so forth\nand so on. But that lasted a very short period, because my mother took sick, and I returned to\nBlamont in the spring of 1940, just in time for the invasion. And so we were in -- I think the\ninvasion is four -- the fifth or sixth of May 1940. My very religious family had prepared\neverything for Shabbat, and the first time in their life, they had to take to the road on the\nShabbat. And here we were, loading as much as we could in a car and taking off direction\nunknown, because the Germans were -- had crossed over. Coming through Belgium,\nHolland, and crossing over. And we were very close to the border, so we left. As a matter of\nfact, a neighbor of ours had a car. Was a crippled lady and her daughter. And nobody to\ndrive the car. And I had had two lessons in driving, so I took the wheel, and followed my\nbrother with... And we drove for five days and five nights. We drove with the bombings\ngoing on. These were convoys of people just carrying with them whatever they could. We\nwere fortunate we always find a room for my grandmother. But anyway, we ended up in the\nsomewhere near Vichy, of all places, and we heard that France had surrendered. This was\nJune 6th, 1940. And here we were. Couldn't go any back. Couldn't go any forward. So we\nstopped. And we waited to see what would happen. What would happen was that all the\nJews from Alsace were expelled because France was divided into two zones: the northern\n* Safe-conduct (French).\npart and the southern part, with a demarcation line in between. But Alsace and Lorraine were\nannexed, and became Germany -- became German right away.\nLike they had done so many times before -- before the World War II, before World War I,\nand...and so on. And so all the Jews from Alsace were expelled. And relatives were ma --\nwere coming down over the demarcation line. And my father and my brother managed to\nfind a farm, that is where -- the house of a guard, in a big chateau in the southwest of France\nin P\u00e9rigeaux, in the free zone. And that's where my family settled for the rest of the war.\nthere were, there was -- there were my parents, my grandmother, my brother, myself; and\nthen two uncles, two aunts, two cousins and two German men who had come -- had escaped\nfrom the -- from Germany. And we took them on...on the farm. One of my great guilts about\nthat period is that I wasn't -- I didn't know what was going on. We were -- we felt safe in this\nfarm, where we were going to wait. We were going to have food. And I really didn't know\nwhat was going on. And my family was not very new, were not -- wasn't oriented to this kind\nof thing. And I was -- we were surviving there. I was milking the cows, literally. One\nmorning the gendarme\u2019 came -- the French police, the French gendarme -- and asked for our\ntwo German men. They were rounding them up. And I was so unaware of what was going\non that I went to call them. But one was smart enough, aware enough, to jump out of the\nback in the woods and disappear. And the other one, of course, they took along. To this day I\ndon't know what happened to him. The Jews had to register in the south of -- we never had to\nwear the, the star in the south of France, but as Jews we all had to register with the\nCommisariat aux Affaires Juives\u2019-- the, the special office for Jews. And my parents\nregistered. I suppose I did, too, although I don't remember that particularly. But somehow\nduring this first year there, I got a call -- I got a, I got a letter. I think it was a letter. I don't\nthink we had a phone. Certainly we had no transportation. We had no phone. And I got a call\nfrom one of my former leaders in the Jewish scouting movement. And I'm going to mention\nher name, because she's so well known: Andr\u00e9e Salomon is known by everybody for her\nincredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war. And had\nalready started doing so in Strasbourg, when all -- when German Jewish parents started to\nsend children across the border for us to... And they were placed in families throughout\nAlsace. And Andr\u00e9e was already the person to take care of them, and to, to see to their\nsafety. How she got in touch with me, I will never know because unfortunately she died a\nfew years ago, before I ever really cleared this up. But she said they -- I was needed in one of\nthe camps, and explained the situation. And this is the first time I knew about camps. And to\nthis day, it's a great guilt that I carry, that I didn't know about these camps. But I packed and I\nleft. Not very much support from my family. I was very distressed because my mother was\nnot terribly well, had taken very hardly all these changes in leaving Strasbourg. But I left. Of\n* Soldiers of the Police Militia (French).\n> The correct name of this bureau is: Commisariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux Questions Juives\n[Commission for Jewish Affairs] (French).\ncourse, there were plenty of people on the farm. And I, and I Just packed my things, and I\nwent to Rivesaltes. Now, I don't know if you want me to go into any explanation as to what\nRivesaltes was. I'm sure you know about Rivesaltes, but I didn't know. And I went there, and\nbecame a resident -- a worker for OSE.\u00b0 At that time, OSE had -- of course, Madame\nSalomon sent them over to there -- another worker, Vivette, and a doctor, Doctor Malkin.\nAnd then there were other organizations that, like the OSE, had resident workers there.\nThere was the Unitarians, the Quakers, the CIMADE,\u2019 and a number of other rescue\nagencies \u2014 Secours Suisse,\u201d particularly. The Swiss Relief Agen...\nI'm not sure exactly what it was called. And the primary job of these agencies was to help\nimprove the conditions of the people there, because the camps hygienic and physical\nconditions were beyond descriptions. The camp was situated in an area where what I\nremember mostly is the wind blowing -- this hot wind called \"La Tramontane,\"\u201d which, the\npeople being so weak from malnutrition, they just rolled along with the wind. They couldn't,\nthey couldn't walk in the wind. Now, in the camp there was still some Spanish refugees from\nthe Franco wars, and in the camps were all the Jews that had been deported from Rhineland,\nfrom areas along the Rhine, on the -- in Germany. Some of them had already been in Gurs,\nanother very infamous camp in the southwest of France, and transferred to Rivesaltes. After\na year of internment, they were in very weakened condition already. Because, although as I\nunderstand it the food that was provided was according to the Geneva Convention, but much\nof it disappeared on the black market. In addition to which, there wasn't much food, period,\nin France. And one of the jobs of OSE, which was originally actually a medical social\nagency, was to provide extra rations for the people. So that became one of the important\ntasks of OSE, to distribute whatever it could. Some day it was milk from the Secours Suisse.\nSometimes it was dates. Sometimes it was a handful of olives. And always a little bread that\nwe had to divide. I shall never forget entering into the barracks and dividing the breads in\neight pieces. And how can you make them exactly equal? So we put numbers of them, so\nthat it was like a, a lottery for people to get the piece of bread. So that no one would be\nslighted, because fights would erupt around the size of a piece of bread. I remember handing\na man in the barrack a piece of bread and his just falling back. And he was dead. That was\nthe condition of the adults. And, of course, the men lived in their own barracks, and the\nwomen in their own.\n\u00b0 Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Organization for Children\u2019s Rescue] (French).\n\u201d Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Inter-Mouvement aupres des Evacu\u00e9s [Committee of Inside-Movement\nrelated to Evacuants] (French).\n* Swiss Rescue (French).\n\u201d North wind; Tramontana (French).\nAnd the children, we tried to keep them in special ilot'\u201d where we kept the children, and tried\nto provide as much as we could for them in terms of extras. A lot of little activities, and so\non. My -- but the particular purpose for my going to Rivesaltes was to take care of the\nchildren. Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later.\nOh, I did food rationing, this food ration distribution; but I took care of the children. I\nremember the first Saturday afternoon, Shabbat afternoon, we gathered. I had two hundred\nand eighty kids for one Oneg Shabbat.'' And I've been trying to do something in one, one\nbig barrack. But there were wonderful people among the internees. There were some people\nwho -- whose moral fiber was just such that they wanted to do something for the others. So\nthere were teachers, there were rabbis, there were people who, who lent a hand. And we tried\nto provide whatever we could and -- with nothing. Singing, dancing --whatever we could. I\nalso created some groups of girl scouts. I mean, girl scouts in a camp! It sounds ridiculous\nwhen I think of it today, but that's all I knew 1n, in, 1n activities. So I created girl scouts. But\nwhen I have the pictures to show you later, I had -- we organized activities. In the\nmeanwhile, OSE proceeded to get the liberation from the camp of the children under 16.\nAnd some over 16 as well, because you could just work around that a little bit. The\nprocedure is well-known today. I think that the way it was done it was that you could get the\npermissions through some very cooperating officials in the Department de Herault, where\nPerpignan was -- no -- in H\u00e9rault. Not in Perpignan, in a neighboring Department. To get the\nchildren into residence there. And once they were there we could of course disperse them\ninto the very number of children's home that existed, that OSE had set up in the south of\nFrance after having transferred the children from the children's homes around Paris. Because\n-- all nght, I have to back-track a little bit there. OSE had already set children's home up\naround Paris in the late '30s for children who had come from Germany. In fact, I had been\noffered a job in one of these homes and instead went to work in Paris. So we had all these\nchildren's home existing there, and it was a an administrative procedure in trying to get these\nchildren out. But it was not only that.\nIt was it was persuading the parents to let the children go. Mind you, at that time we had not\n-- deportations had not started yet there. They were still -- we are still in the early part of\n1942 now. Yeah, we're still in the early part of 1942, and the deportations haven't started.\nBut there were rumors of shipping the people off to labor camps or resettlement camps. Far\nfrom us was any kind of idea of what -- where they were really sent. But OSE had had the\nforesight, through some people like Andr\u00e9e Salomon and a doctor, Joseph Weill, to think of\nsaving the children and getting them out. And at numerous occasion, I had opportunity to\nconvoy children out or to take children out. I remember one particular group that sticks in\nmy mind of all of it. We had a small group -- but sizeable enough -- of Down's Syndrome\nchildren in the camp. Very young, small Down's Sy -- and there was a place for them in\nBergerac, in the Dordogne, and here we are on the Rivesaltes. I mean, had to cross all the\n'\u201d Small islands, figuratively (French).\n'' Sabbath entertainment, rejoicing, and reception (Hebrew).\nsouth of France. And I took these children by train to Bergerac. There must have been five,\nsix of them. These children had actually learned to walk in the camp, had never known how\nto take steps. And we get to the station, and they didn't know how to go down or up stairs\nbecause they had just never experienced this. In addition to which, they were -- had Down's\nSyndrome. But that's the one convoy I remember, of all of them. I'm not sure exactly why,\nbut I remember this one more than anything else.",
        "Q: What was that trip like?",
        "A: I only remember that, that -- the steps. What it was on the train, I really don't remember. I\nknow I got them to safety in Bergerac. What happened to them afterwards, I don't know, but\nwe got them out. What I do remember very vividly is the deportations starting. And that was\nin August, I think, of August of '42. It was again a matter of sending people in work camps --\nto work camps, or to resettlement camps. I think we should have known that that wasn't quite\nit, because they were rounding up. I can see this elderly woman on crutches, and I can see\nthe young people and I can see the sick -- all being called out on this enormous empty space\nin the camp of Rivesaltes and crossing the line over as their name was called. I also\nremember this very dignified young Rabbi, who would not hurry this woman on crutches,\nand walking over that empty space. Now, I was very young. And I had learned a lot about\nhumanity while I was in this camp. I learned a lot. I remember one woman, and to this day I\nremember her name. Do you want her name? She was Madame Grynszpan. In fact, she was\nan aunt of the young Grynszpan who, who started things in Kristallnacht because he killed\nthe attach\u00e9 in Paris. And she was always -- in spite of the horrible conditions there, she\nmanaged to have a neat scarf on her head and lipstick on. And she says, \"The day you are\ngoing to see me without my makeup, you know, that's the end for me.\" I know she escaped,\nbecause I -- one day I saw her on the train station in Rivesaltes. And, of course, I made no\neffort to acknowledge that I recognized her, because she had escaped, and so I know she\nescaped. So I -- one thing 1s that I had -- I learned so much from the, the, the dignity and\nsome of the attitude of the people who were living under these horrible conditions. I was, I\nwas very young, and, and it made a tremendous impression on me. I remember these first\nconvoys. The train came to Rivesaltes, to the tracks there, and people were boarded. Now, I\ndo not remember cattle trains. These were regular trains. But what I remember mostly, too,\nwas during that period there were categories of people that could be deported and some who\ncouldn't. There were still categories, because -- gosh, how naive we were -- and thought that\nit was going to continue. If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some --\nor in World War I, I should say that. If you had been born one, one parent, there were\ncategories who were non-Jewish. Or if you had resided for that long in Paris. So we\nscrambled for certificate from concierge to demonstrate that he had -- so and so had lived in\nParis for that period of time. We scrambled for all kinds of documents, sometimes falsifying\nthem somewhat. And I remember, three of us -- I don't remember who the third one was. But\nI know was Jacqueline Levy, with whom I've discussed this very recently. We had all of a\nsudden, people were all in the trains. And we hadn't -- we had these papers to get twenty\npeople out of, of the train. And we went through the train and got these 20 or 21 or 22 people\nout of the camp, because we had these wonderful papers. What we didn't know 1s that there\nwas a quota for that train. And while we scrambled to get twenty people out, twenty other\npeople were rounded up without -- regardless of their status, and were just added to the train.\nWhen I discuss -- I remember discussing this in Paris a few years back with Jacqueline, and\nshe said she shared exactly what I felt. She said when she found that out it was a nightmare\nto realize that the defensive people actually were replacing these people in, you know, in, in\nthe train that we so miraculously saved. Nobody was saved, finally.",
        "Q: How did you choose the people to save?",
        "A: Be--because we had the papers. We, we didn't choose anybody. We managed to, to put\ntogether a, a record for these people, enough papers to fit the categories. We didn't choose\nanybody. I mean, the papers came through. This certificate and that certificate, and this\ndocument. And we had sufficient documents for these select twenty people. So we didn't\nchoose them. We -- oh, gosh, no. Nobody played God. But that's what -- that's how we got\nthem out of the train, only we were not realizing that actually twenty-odd people would be\nadded to the quota. Can I stop?",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: I need to take something for my headache. It's just getting so bad. I have to take another pill.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: That's the point I want, I would like you to make then -- that you were doing all of this under\nyour own name. Ok, we're back again.",
        "A: Well, during this -- starting in -- as I said, starting in, I think, in August, through September\nand through the end of the year, deportations continued because round-ups of Jews. First it\nwas the foreign-born Jews. Then it was different -- other categories of Jews. And then it was\nJews, period, that were rounded-up. And Rivesaltes became the center from which they were\nsent off to destination unknown. But in the meanwhile, we continued to try to get out as\nmany children as possible through the legal means. And when the legal means didn't work.\nBecause we felt a sense of urgency, sometimes we stood watch at the gates when the trucks\ncame loaded with Jews into the camp, to try to separate the children from the families right\nthen and there so that we could get them in the special barracks for the children and work on\ntheir liberation right away. I mean, in retrospect, to ask the parents who were so bewildered\ncoming into the camp and to separate from their children. And we had them in, 1n, in the\nspecial barracks, where the children worried about their parents, where they saved food for\ntheir parents, where they matured so quickly. They, they -- sort of there was a, a reversal, as\nthey worrying about their parents just like a parent would worry about a child. And we\nbecame also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family\nreunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the homes, the children's\nhomes, to get the children back into the camps for family reunion purposes. So we had to try\nto avoid that as well. Both in the homes, which was impossible when they rounded up the\nkids, but when they came back into the camps. And some, of course, were deported with\ntheir parents. Some under 16, and definitely the over 16 as well. By the end -- I forget\nexactly the date -- when the invasion of North Africa came about by the Allies -- all of\nFrance was occupied. And I remember the Germans coming down south. In fact, coming\nthere had been no Germans in Rivesaltes. This was strictly Vichy government. But when the\nsouth of France was occupied, the Germans came in as well, and then the round-ups started\nharder and harder.\nAnd I remember one particular one on Simchat Torah.'* And on Simchat Torah, the very\nreligious Jews, about to be put into the trucks and from the trucks into the into the trains,\nwere dancing to rejoice with the Torah -- which they didn't have. But this was still a holiday\nthat we're celebrating. And truckloads of Jews were coming in from Belgium and from\nHolland, and from all over. And rounded up all over. And among them, some French-born\nJews. It was just absolutely, at this point, a very -- I imagine they were French Jews; I'm not\nquite sure. But anyway, they were rounded-up, coming into the camp. In the meanwhile, we\ncontinued to get the children out. And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers,\nwho was liberated from the camp and then placed very briefly with the scouts, was\neventually placed into my family to help my parents at the farm. She is still living today in\nIsrael, and is my sister-in-law. She married my brother. This is a girl who was born in France\nof Polish parents, and the parents never bothered to acquire the French nationality. So when\nthe war came, they were all put into Rivesaltes: her two parents, her two brothers. The father\nwas deported right away into forced labor, which means he was sent to his death. The older\nbrother joined the Maquis\u2019 -- the French underground -- and was killed under such horrible\ncondition that I have never found out the details. The younger brother was placed by OSE,\nby one of our network workers; and is living still in Israel. And Rachel living with my\nfamily. And her mother survived -- also helped by OSE. She just died a year ago in Israel. So\nby the end of 1942, there remained but about five hundred people in Rivesaltes. And all the\nkids had been -- whatever kids we could liberate, we had sent into various camps to the\nvarious children's homes, I'm sorry. And, of course, also into the youth facilities of the\nJewish scouts, because they had facilities for over-16s. And, of course, we had to lie about\nthe ages; and, of course, we had to get them out. See, by then we still had not directly\nworked in an underground or in illegal kind of way; except that when the pressure came, we\ntried to help kids escape as much as quickly as we can. I remember always wearing a cape.\nGirl scouts had capes in those days, khaki capes. And you could get a baby under your arms,\nyou know. And you could walk out of the camp with children. The Secours Suisse smuggled\n* Rejoicing of the Torah (Hebrew).\n'\u00b0 Anti-Nazi military partisans, associated with other groups in the French Resistance.\na truck into the camp, and we smuggled children out of the camp under milk cans. And we\nthere are many different stories to tell as how kids came out, and the one I remember mostly\nis the one having children on the -- actually, literally, in my arms under my cape. But I don't\nremember what happened afterwards. We handed them over to another network. Each one of\nus did only one piece of the work. The camp was closed in November or December 1942,\nand whoever was left was sent to Gurs. By that time, I had contracted a horrible jaundice\nbecause of the living conditions there at the camp because we social workers didn't have any\nmore better hygienic conditions than the internees, \u2018though I had an individual room. We had\none barrack where all the workers had an individual room. But we had no toilet facilities.\nAnd we had one bucket that each one of us took turns having in our own room. We also had\nbed bugs infesting everything. And though my parents occasionally sent me some food, it\nwas run over with worms by the time I got it. But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway,\nbecause it was food. And if I ever want to look again in a, in a -- what are they called?\nRutabagas, Rutabagas. Never in my life again ever, anyway.",
        "Q: What -- before, before you go on from here, what was it like for Simone Weil? In this camp,\nyou're a young woman. What did it feel like to you? Did you miss your parents? Were you\nfeeling that you took any risk in doing this, even though it was legal? What was it like for\nyou doing all these things?",
        "A: At this time it was not illegal yet.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because I was an accepted French citizen, although Jewish, in the camp. You know, people\nhave asked me, \"Did it ?\" The same kind of question. First of all, you're young. And when\nyou're young, you feel sort of invulnerable and you really don't think beyond what you have\nto do. And I think my the other workers were my age. It was it was sort of a natural thing to\ndo. There was a job to be done. It was a natural thing. I don't know. It just I don't think I\nreally thought much of the risk. It was very interesting; you ask me about risk. The camp\ncommand the commandant of the camp was a police commissar of the neighborhood in\nwhich I had lived in Strasbourg. And he knew my father. I'll talk about him again later.\nThere is a connection there. These people took on jobs which, if, if they had refused to take\non these jobs, if more people had refused to do these kinds of things, maybe, maybe just\nmaybe, things would not have worked out the way they did. For us, I don't know. I guess for\nme the risk I took -- occasional trips to the farm, occasionally. Taking a train to go back to\nthe farm was no excursion. On the trains There were so few trains. I usually traveled with a\nknapsack. And you tried to get your knapsack through a window; and you climbed through a\nwindow, and you stood up all night in the hall. Or I remember standing up all night in the\ntoilets. You know, we were -- there were so few trains, and so little means of transportation.\nSo I did occasionally go back and see my family. I don't not often, but I, I did. What I did,\nactually, when the camp was closed, I had to go back to my family because I was sick. I was\n-- and actually, I went to Gurs. And but I -- by Gurs, by that time, they would not let any new\nworkers come into Gurs. And I remember meeting Dr. Joseph Weill in a train, and he says,\n\"Y ou better take care of your -- \" I was yellow from here, from the top of my head to the\nbottom. And I really had to take a rest. So I did go back to the farm just to recover from that.\nFrom that jaundice or hepatitis, or whatever you'd call it. And when, when I was healthy\nenough again, then I went to work in one of the children's homes. Because I couldn't get into\nGurs, and here were all these children's homes. And I had the background in education early\nchildhood education. So I took a job as the chief educator, for OSE again, near Limoges.\nAnd my family wasn't far.\nThe farm wasn't far from Limoges, in Poulouzat. The Director was Monsieur Job, who later\nbecame one of the administrator of OSE, who's still alive in Paris, whom I still correspond\nwith, whom I still see when I'm in Paris. And here we were, taking care of the children\nwhom we had gotten out of the camp. This was a home that catered to maybe 50 children of\nall ages. And we tried to make the children as live as normal a life as possible -- \"normal\" in\nquotation marks. Again, the food situation was terrible. I remember sorting out rice in which\nmice had gotten. And taking out the, the rice doo. Is that what you call it? If it's dog doo, it's\nrice mice doo. We ate it, because that's all we had. And making do. And, and yet, and, and\ncutting out things of the papers to decorate the rooms. And, and I worked at creating as\nJewish an atmosphere as we possibly could, leading Shabbat services. Because of my\nbackground, this was no problem. I could do these things very easily. And I tutored some of\nthe kids who had missed schoolings, some who were prepare preparing their baccalaureate.\u201d\nThey went to school. They went to public school, but still under their real names. And this is\n1943. I also remember that the drama coach who came on weekends or whatever to teach to,\nto take care of the kids, was Marcel Marceau, of all people. Whose real name is not Marcel\nMarceau, but whose real name is Marcel Mangel (ph), and who was a kid from my\nneighborhood in Strasbourg. And so we had the best. He was a student at that time, doing\nartwork in Limoges.\nBut these were these were my peers. You know, he's a little bit younger than I am. But by\nthat time the OSE Direction had seen the writing on the wall. Some children's homes had\nbeen rounded up. The police was coming to pick up the over-16. The police -- the French\npolice I'm talking about -- was finding these very easy targets, because here was a group of\nJewish children. So at that time, the OSE Direction had decided that the children had to get\nout of the homes in two steps. There was one step: they was under their real names, into non-\nJewish kind of settings, but mostly, to form a clandestine network and place the children\nunder assumed names. And workers were recruited for that, and I was one of them. what\n* Tn France, this is the equivalent of a high school diploma.\nwere the qualifications? None, really. Wanting to do it, but also not being not looking\n\"Jewish.\" Quote, unquote. I mean, there are some people who just simply couldn't do it\nbecause they were \"typ\u00e9s,\"\u201d as we called it. And so I qualified. And Georges Garel, who is\norganized this clandestine network for OSE, recruited me in Poulouzat in children's home\nwhere I worked because all the children's homes were going to be closed. In the meanwhile,\nthere had been arr\u00e9tes -- arrests -- in the Direction of OSE and the various offices. There had\nbeen really -- 1t was danger with knowing where the children were, and so on. So I got\nrecruited for this. And this was towards the end of '43. I therefore left the children's home,\nand took up residence in Chateauroux. Chateauroux is about what -- 60, 75 miles north of\nLimoges. Well, I had to change identity. And my name was Simone Weil, and I decided on\n\"Werlin (ph),\" because it was sort of easy to change the \"I\" to an \"R\" and to add something\nat the end of it. And I had to work on getting, number one, a nationality -- a Fiche de\nNationalit\u00e9.'\u00b0 I'm not quite sure how I got it, but I have it. And from that on -- oh, and I made\nmyself being born in Toul, because we -- I knew that in Toul, the, the city hall had been\nbombed and all the documents had disappeared. And by then, there was really a whole\nnetwork of people working in forging false papers. So we had access to identification cards,\nblank ones and so forth. But I did it, really, the legal way. After I had a Fiche de Nationalit\u00e9\nby which I think I got by just making a statement -- then I had that, claiming that papers had\ndisappeared. I couldn't produce a birth certificate. I got an identification card and gave a\nLimoges address, and immediately then moved to Chateauroux. And had myself registered\nin Chateauroux. So it was perfectly legal. I mean, it was perfectly ok. The most wonderful\nthing -- my nose. The most wonderful thing that helped me in the forging my identity was\nthe help I got from the Director of the school of social work and the director of the school of\nearly childhood education. One lived in Clermont-Ferrand. One lived in Paris. I took the trip,\nand I just simply told them that I needed their help.\nAnd I have in my documents still a certificate stating that I that Simone Werlin was their\nstudent in 1938. I got a certifi-- I got a diploma established in on that name, under my false\nname. And I got some others you know, other statements to that effect. And to this day, I am\nconvinced that at the time I was arrested, to which I'm going to come later, that these papers\nhelped me. And these people, without, without any question, just established these papers for\nme. In fact, I went to Paris. I remember very well, because this is the first trme I saw people\nwearing the yellow star because we did not wear it in the south of France. I also needed a\ncover. And the Department of Public Health put me on their fictitious payroll, I suppose. But\nI had a statement saying that Simone Werlin is employed by the Department of Public\nHealth. And just to make sure that I knew what I was, what the Department of Public Health\nwas, I went at least there once. And now comes a funny story. You know what department\nwas assigned to? The department that checked the health of the prostitutes of the city of\nChateauroux. And they were coming regularly to that clinic to be examined, and that was my\n\u00b0 Typed or stereotyped (French).\n'\u00ae Nationality card (French).\nassignment. But at least I knew what my assignment was so that later on I had to describe it,\nI could describe it. But it has a little funny aspect to it. I got a room, stayed with two elderly\nladies. And we had a team working together in Chateauroux. I remember at least two of\nthem. One was a cousin of mine. And we all had assumed names. And children would come\nto us, brought from various children's home by a worker. Brought to us, for us to change the\nidentity of the kids, and then place them in various foster homes, institutions, families,\nconvents, what have you.\nThis was our job. And transportation was mostly bicycles, train, horse and buggy, whatever.\nOr walking. Whatever we could round up. And it ended up by, by having around\nChateauroux, in that whole area, we had some three hundred and fifty kids placed. The\nDirection of the region was in Limoges, but Chateauroux, in that region, we had between\nthree and 350 kids. It was a matter of finding the places and trying to finding following up\nwith the kids. What I remember most dramatically \u2014 and, and also sometimes through\nChateauroux came groups of children that had to be escorted towards other workers, who\nwould help them get into Switzerland. And I remember one group of children that came one\nnight, and we had to find a place for them overnight. And I in some school or some\ninstitution. And we worked feverishly all night to get them false papers. For the kids. And\ntake out the labels out of their clothes that the mothers had lovingly sewed into their clothes\nand take those labels out. And look through their luggage. Take away whatever they had\nbecause they had to have be safe. And just coach them in what their new identity was. I have\noften said that if I had known then what I have since learned, being a clinical social worker, I\nthink I would have been completely immobilized by the, the traumatization that these\nchildren went through. I could have just not functioned. And it was just a matter of saving\nlives, and that was it. And I remember taking these -- I don't know how many children -- and\nspreading them through a train, and coaching them. Some who spoke French was all right.\nSome who spoke with an accent, they were supposed to be from Alsace. And telling them\nwhat their name was, and knowing how to answer. And getting spreading them through the\ntrain, and getting them across France into Lyons. And there, getting them to another team of\nworkers. That was the end of my mission. And they would then be handed over to somebody\nelse, and gotten into Switzerland. And kids came day and night, and we changed their\nidentity. I remember most I remember two incidents that I want to relate. One of the source\nof help was the Catholic Church. And the area the area close to the Chateau was Bourges,\nwhich has an arch archbishop-- archbishopric. Is that the word? And I went to see the\nArchbishop of Bourges, to ask him for making -- it easy mak-- making the entry into\nconvents and to all Catholic orphanages easy for us. But he knew what was the object of my\nmission, but it was never discussed. I had never encountered an archbishop in my life. And I\nwent to the Archbishop in Bourges, and he gave me a letter of introduction to the various\nCatholic institutions.\nHe also handed my hand with his ring, and I hadn't the slightest idea what I was supposed to\ndo with it. But that was a minor detail. I also worked with Protestant agency that ran summer\ncamps for kids who had to flee Paris. And she also -- this was a partisan social worker in\nBourges, who was very unhappy being in this very Catholic kind of area. And she had no\nidea what the real object of my work was. All I wanted is place children in her summer\ncamps. And I hit it off with her. And because she was so unhappy as a Protestant 1n this\nCatholic environment, taking me for a Catholic we had some discussion which made her say\nthat she had never met such a liberal Catholic as I. I haven't the slightest idea what I said. But\nwhen the dis-- when the questions became too difficult, I managed to escape by pretending\nthat I wasn't feeling well and going to the bath. But anyway, we had the openings to these\ncamps, summer camps, for our children, and that's where we placed them. I worked at that\ntime with another worker, who was actually not Jewish, Ann-Marie, and with two other\nworkers who were not Jewish, among in our team, as well. At one time and at one time and,\nof course, the as the war was drawing closer and closer to an end, the round-ups just\ncontinued. Both my parents were arrested at the farm. And \u2018though I had -- by that time, the\nuncles and aunts had left; and there was just my both my parents, my grandmother, my\nbrother and, and the girl we had placed, you know, who placed from, from Rivesaltes. The\nuncles and aunts had gone elsewhere, found their own place. And I had provided my parents\nwith false papers. But, when in the spring of 1944, the gendarmes came up and said to my\nfather, \"Etes-vous Juif, Monsieur?\"\"\u2019 He said, \"Out, Monsieur.\"\"\u00ae And they took both my\nmother and my father, leaving -- and my brother pretended that he was the farm hand, and\nmy sist-- my future sister-in-law, too. She was the maid, she pretended. And both my parents\nwere interned in a camp near the farm.\nBut the French police actually went over and beyond the expectations of the German\nauthority, and had taken my mother to a camp that was only for men. So after 24 hours, they\nsent her back to the farm. And she survived. And I had heard had word of my father being in\nthat camp. So I -- oh, I always traveled in something that looked like a Red Cross uniform.\nSomething navy-bluish, and some Red Cross sign. I mean, it was really nothing real, but it\nlooked like a uniform, so I had access to the camp there. And through some cigarettes or\ntobacco or something, I got a message to my father. Who, by the way, survived. Because on\nD-Day 1944, the camp was attacked by the Maquis and the internees were able to escape --\namong which my father who returned to the farm. But in the meanwhile, there was great\nconcern for my grandmother. And I managed to come back, round-up a truck from the\nMaquis -- from the underground -- and load my grandmother into the truck and get her to\nP\u00e9rigueux, the city near the, the city prefecture where we lived, and get her into an old age\nhome. And a very nice gentile woman would visit her regularly there. But aside from the\nother work that I did, it was one of the most dramatic things that I did because she was nearly\nblind. And she said, \"Don't leave me here!\" And the bed was on the wrong side and she\n'T \u201cAre you French, Sir?\u201d (French).\n'S \u201cVes, Sir.\u201d (French).\ncouldn't find her things, but I had no choice. I left her, but she survived. Not very long. She\nnever came back to Alsace, but she did survive the, the this period of the old age home. Also\nwhen I was in Chateauroux, you know, Georges Garel, the head of our network, would\nappear from time to time. And he appeared one morning, having come from God knows\nwhere. And coming to that room which I rented and say, \"You know, we have to move very\nfast. The members of the Jewish Committee in P\u00e9rigueux have all been shot as in reprisal for\nGod knows what had happened to some German. The Director one of the Directors,\nMonsieur Lederman, has been shot. He has -- his wife has had died the year before of cancer.\nAnd he has two daughters in a private boarding school, and we have to get them out of\nthere.\" What he didn't know...that Monsieur Lederman was my uncle. And these were my\ncousins. And they were two young teenagers, and I called them. I had the number. How we\ngot calls through is a puzzle to me today; but the phone must have functioned. And I called\nthem in the school in which they were. And I told them, \"You pack up, and you go. And you\ncome to Chateauroux, and I'll be at the station.\" And I was there. And they came. And there\nwas a curfew. I don't know how I made it through the curfew. And we got them into a safe\nhome we had at Chateauroux.; there was gentile lady who loaned us the apartment where we\ncould do our papers. So I remember changing their name to Ledormier. And while we were\nthere, I do remember the Milice\u2019\u201d coming. But the Milice didn't come to -- they didn't know.\nThey were just looking at apartments. But they came, and I jumped out the back window\nwith my two cousins. And also Ann-Marie tells me it was the paper of her husband who had\nbeen deported to Auschwitz and who -- whose papers she had. And I don't remember that,\nbut as we put our selected memories together, we reconstructed. And I reconstructed the\nevents. As a matter of fact, while I was in France I found that hou-- that house again. And I\nknew it was it because I saw the windows from which we jumped. But anyway, the girls\nwere placed into a Catholic convent, and they survived. Last year --",
        "Q: Ok, excuse me. At this point, we have to stop and change tapes.",
        "A: Ok.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #1\n\u201d Militia (French)\nTape #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: We're on. Ok, take us back. Let us continue.",
        "A: So we continue with the story of my cousins, where I left it off. Just a year ago, one of my\ncousins came to see me in Chapel Hill. And she got off the plane. And I waited for her. She\nsays, \"This is the second time that you're waiting for me someplace.\" And she remembered\nthe time I was waiting for her at the station. But then she said, \"When you called us in the\nschool where we were to tell us to pack and come, we didn't know whether it was really\nyou.\" Distortion of the telephone. \"And we had really didn't know whether it was a trap for\nus. And whether it was a safe thing to do, to come to Chateauroux, until we saw you at the\nstation.\" And that devastated me. And actually, they did not know their father had been shot.\nAnd they're telling me that I had to tell them that their father had been killed. They thought\nhe had been deported. I do not remember this, nor do I remember so many of the details. I\nhave recently encountered a woman who lives in Richmond, who was a child in Rivesaltes\nwho I got out of Rivesaltes and who I placed in a convent later on and went back to work\nwith me in a children's home that I had later. She survived this way. Her family was\ndeported. And she went to the United States soon after that. And she gives me all these\ndetails. And I believe her because it fits into what I remember, but I don't remember her, and\nI don't remember the details of it. I do not remember individuals as such. I remember my\ncousins. That's somewhat in some way different -- it's very close to me. I see myself going\ninto farms. I see myself talking to children, talking to families. I remember the incident of\nthe, the Archbishop in Bourges. I remember being arrested -- and I'm going to come into that\nin a minute. But the individual kids, I do not remember. Exc-- I remember the groups, and\nnot one in particular. I do remember the one day that I went to Limoges on my bicycle. 75\nmiles. In my memory, it was a straight route to Limoges. Six or seven years ago, we went\nback there. I told my husband, \"Don't worry, it's...",
        "Q: Excuse me. We're going to have to stop the tape.\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]\nYou started to tell me about the trip.",
        "A: On regular intervals, I guess, I had to go to Limoges, which was really the headquarters of\nthis area. And I remember some of the workers there having to do with papers, or having to\ndo with whatever instructions we had about our network, our children. And I remember\nwalking with this other worker in Limoges, in the city. And treating ourselves to some of\nthese coupon-free pastries. We had to -- we could go into a pastry shop, and they had made\nsome pastry out of some God knows what ersatz stuff. And coming out of it, and a young\nman coming to us, and saying, \"Follow me.\" And opening the big book he had under his\narm, which was not a book but something that hid a box with a revolver in it. The -- 1t was\nclear that they were not after me as well as after Charlotte. Charlotte was living in -- she\nlooked very Jewish, by the way. She was very \"typ\u00e9e.\" And they suspected her to be part of\nthe Resistance. And he marched us with this gun under his arm to her apartment. And there,\nransacked her apartment, looking for I'm not sure what. But I had sewn in the lining of my\npocket some seals, to make false papers. You know, of city halls and town halls, and dates\nand stuff. I also had, on cigarette paper, the coded list of my children, because -- I didn't\nmention this earlier. OSE had a list of the children with their real names and their false\nnames, with copies in Geneva. Not one identity was ever lost. Some children were lost,\nunfortunately. But no identity ever got lost. And we had codes in which way we were\nkeeping lists. I mean, these identities available. And I had that with me. And here I was,\nwatching calmly as they were ransacking Charlotte's apartment, and trying finding a way of\ngetting at least rid of this incrim-- incriminating documents I had on me. So I asked to go to\nthe bathroom. And what I know how to do was to act as a very innocent little girl. I think I\ncan still do it. And they let me go. And that simple little slip, on their part, saved me. I went\nto the bathroom, got everything out of the lining of my pocket, got the papers out, flushed\nwhatever I could down the toilets, threw everything that I could out of the windows, and\ncame back into the room clear of all this incriminating stuff. I knew that, you know, we'd get\nsome other seals and we'd get the lists. They were saved somewhere else. Legend has it\nalready that I swallowed the cigarette papers. But I'm sure I didn't. I'm sure I threw them out.\nI get back and they went through my papers. And this is where I want to come back to the\nwonderful paper I had. I always carried with me all these document that these very helpful\npeople had made out for me -- my diplomas, my cert-- I had everything with me. Library\ncards which had false from pre-war library cards, under my false name. I had university\nstudent cards, and etc. I had all this with me. They slipped on one thing, which have which\nwould have been my undoing. I had given an address in Limoges as my original. I had my\nidentification card. I didn't even know where the street was. I didn't even know whether it\nexisted. If they had asked me to take them there, I couldn't have done it. But they didn't. So I\nleft this place. they imprisoned Charlotte, but we managed to liberate her to help her escape.\nAnd she's still living.",
        "Q: How did you help her?",
        "A: I don't -- we didn't. I wasn't part of that. The resident workers in Limoges managed. I don't\nknow how they did it. I haven't the slightest idea. I was very anxious to retrieve my\nknapsack, which had a lot of incriminating papers in it. And so I got in touch with another\nworker, who first went to where my knapsack was parked -- I don't remember where -- and\ngot out all the stuff that was in there that would have been incriminating. And then I got my\nknapsack back, and then I went back on bicycle 75 miles to Chateauroux. Now, just a few\nyears ago in Paris, I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, \"Oh, I\nknow who you are. You spent the night. You were arrested in my room.\" I don't remember. I\nhave absolutely no memory of it. She remembered the incident. She remembers Charlotte,\nand how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued Charlotte. I don't know how. I\ndon't know how. But for me, I was anxious to get out of Limoges with my cleansed\nknapsack. I remember this as a straight route to Limoges. And I took it a few years back, and\nit was the rollercoast-- the worst rollercoaster road. And my husband said to me, \"This 1s a\nstraight road?\" In my memory, this was a straight road. So I came back to Chateauroux. And\nno sooner did I get to my room that my landlady says, \"Your friends from Limoges came to\nsee you, and you were not home.\" Needless to say that I spent no time in Chateauroux, and\ntook my bicycle and went on to Bourges, where I had somebody else. But you see, it wasn't\nalways bicycle. Whenever we could, we took a train and put the bicycle in the luggage\ncompartment. And we went as far as we could on the train, on where the Maquis had blown\nup the tracks, we had to get out. We were always rejoicing when the tracks were blown up.\nSo we took the bike, and we went a little bit further. So that way, we, we traveled. So I went\nto Bourges. And I even remember getting a horse and buggy part of the way, putting the\nbicycle in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from\nLimoges were, were sure that I was somewhat safe. There's another crazy incident that I do\nremember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of Rivesaltes was the\nCommissar de Police from Strasbourg. He ended up being the Commissar de Police of\nChateauroux, where I was doing underground work. And I did something which today seems\nabsolutely crazy to me. I went to him. And I told him, \"I know you know who I am.\" But I\ntold him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing. And I was expecting\nhim to leave me alone. In retrospect, 1t sounds absolutely totally crazy. But he never\nbothered me. It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you\nknow, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you\nknow, \"See what I did for you?!\" But at that time I went to my superiors at OSE, who says,\n\"He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the\ncommandant of the camp of Rivesaltes and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been,\nyou know, more to his credit.\"\nSo, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, \u201cHow did it feel?\u201d I got a\nsense of invulnerability. Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring. And\nyou, you feel I could wear these uniforms of Red Cross, or doing and, and just pretend and\ndo anything. And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers\ndoing it. All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was\nin the in the escape, the routes to Spain or to, to Switzerland -- or whether it was in the in the\nMaquis. Whatever. We did it because that was the thing to do. That brings us pretty much to\nalmost the end of the war -- no. I remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944. I thought it was all\nover. It wasn't over by far. And I put my the gold little flag on my bicycle, but very quickly\nput it back in. You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very\ngood Catholic girl. In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to church every Sunday morning in\nthe back of the church. But anyway, it was too early to really tell them. I was I was just\nexploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies\nhad landed, that didn't mean at all that France was liberated. And then the fierce battling\nwent on -- the bombings. I was part of the Red Cross emergency teams, where we went\nwhen there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble.\nThis was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or\nanything. It was just a community work. And that went on. And as reprisals, very nearby was\nthis horrible incident of Oradour-sur-Glane, where the Germans locked up the whole\npopulation in a church and put fire to the church. This was non-Jews as well as Jews. I mean,\nit had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the\nwar and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way. But don't ask me\nthe details of how it happened. I know it happened. I know we did it. I know I did it, but I\ndon't remember the details. I don't remember. More kids coming, and I know we placed\nmore kids. It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over. I, I\nknow this was a, a very hectic period. I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish\ngirls celebrating Passover that spring, in the basement. And one of us watching, standing\nguard at the door, just like Marrano-type kind of celebration. These, some of these little\ndetails come up once in a while. But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really,\nas to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories. With very few\nexceptions, I don't. My sister-in-law, those of my cousins. And the only explanation I can\ncome up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals,\nfor fear of loss, for fear of getting too close. And so that I do not remember individual\nstories, with the few exceptions that I gave you. Also is I left the United -- I left France in\n1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly. And I had one urge and that 1s to put\neverything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war. I never spoke\nFrench to my children, never talked about any of that story. It was all something to put\nbehind me. And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us\nwho feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories.\nWhen the war was over in our in my area, Limoges and Chateauroux, in the fall of 19-- oh,\njust before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that\nconvent, and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on\nGod knows what trucks. And from one stage to the other, and got them back to the farm.\nBecause that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had,\nhaving lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to\nspend there. Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their homes, and I\nreopened the first home in Montintin, in the center of France. It was a big old chateau which\nhad been a children's home before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period. And it\nwas populated by rats and by filth. And we cleaned the rats. To today, I stand on a chair if I\nsee a mouse. In those days, we put traps in, and we caught one rat after another, and we\ncleansed it. And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience. And we got as quickly as\nwe could the children out of the religious institutions, of the Catholic institutions. And we\nhad no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be\nuntil the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the death camps that we\nreally had the reality of what had happened. So we did the best we could to create as quickly\nas we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children. With nothing. With whatever\nwe could. We had staff survive -- survivors. I remember particularly one couple from\nHolland who had survived. And I had really a desire to do something in my field, and that is,\ncreate a home for pre-school children. Because pre-school is, was and has always been -- and\ncontinues to be -- my area of interest. And OSE then replaced, replaced me at Montintin.\nAnd I went to Paris; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in Rivesaltes -- but not\nfor OSE, but for the Unitarians. Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the\nauspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful model home for pre-school age children. Later on,\nwhen I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really\ncopied -- we copies...no, we didn't copy it.\nWe initiated the same model. And these children had survived tn hiding -- but not only\nchildren who had survived in hiding. Children who were entrusted to us by parents who\ncouldn't handle them. They had survived themselves, but they were alone. And for a period\nof time, we had these children. But it was also a training school for early childhood\neducators. Actually, my diploma was in Montessori education. So we set up a Montessori\nprogram in, in the -- in a chateau near Paris, which, by coincidence, happens to be the one\nwhere I had taught in a private school before the war. It was a beautiful place, surrounded by\nground. And there I stayed until -- this was '45 -- and all the do-gooders from the United\nStates came over. Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes. A WAAC\u201d\ngave me some shoes. That was wonderful! And they brought us candy, and they brought us\nall kinds of stuff. But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come\nto the States to continue my training, to go back to France and continue on with my work. To\ntell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the moon. I would have gone anywhere.\nThis was it. Was I was ready for a change. And why me? Why not Jacqueline? Jacqueline\ndidn't know English. She was just as qualified, but I knew English. This was a scholarship\noffered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships\nto give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in\nEurope, not just in France. And would return to their countries to continue to improve the\nsituation. So I had a very hard time. It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon\nletters upon letters to get me a place on a boat, and I came on a warship in 1946. And the\nCouncil of Jewish Women sent me to Tulane University. And for one year, but extended my\nscholarship for a second year, which I completed in Cleveland, and got my Master's Degree\nin social work. But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband. But I did return to\n** Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC after 1978).\nFrance before we got married, and worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. And there I\nam worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these children's homes\nand all these children had to reassess the needs of these children. And I did survey upon\nsurvey of facilities -- not just OSE of various children's homes -- to assess their need and to\nsee what else could be done with the children. And I also set up L'Association des\nTravailleurs Juives~\u2019. I started with training workers in the various homes, with my newly\nacquired wisdom in social work. And I started this program going, going through the JDC.\nAnd my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the\nStates. And after a year, I came back to the States. And that's the end of the story, I guess. I\ncontinued in social work for the rest of my life.",
        "Q: What -- tell us a little bit, if you would, about your adjustment to the United States. What had\nthat year been like when you were here, and what was it like when you returned?",
        "A: Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there. It's interesting. When I went to\nTulane University I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in\nmy own work and in my own experience. And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no\nintention of getting a degree. It was just a year to be exposed to things here. So I didn't work\nvery hard. I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange. Why talk\nabout my war experience? Everybody else had done it. And why did I have to talk about it?\nAnd yet I did because I was their first student. And I went to their triennial conventions, and\nI talked about it. I don't know what I said and how I told the story then. There was a lot of\npublicity. And it bothered me for two reasons. One, because as I said, 1t seemed so natural to\nhave done that. I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it. Everybody did it, in\nmy mind. And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save. And how\ncan you sort of make it this beautiful story? There was just one other thing is that there were\nthere was a program of Ship-a-Box the Council of Jewish Women had. And I accepted to\ntalk, provided they sent packages overseas. And that was one of the, you know, redeeming\nfeatures of my talking. When I transferred to Case Western -- no. It wasn't Case Western, it\nwas Western Reserve University. I got a somewhat different experience. And yet, I\nremember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had\nbeen or what, what my expertise. I mean, after all, I had left I was By then, I was 26 years\nold. I was not a kid fresh out of high school. I mean, this was graduate school because I got\ncredit for all my work I had done. And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all. I\ndidn't find -- what surprised me very much 1s the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds\nof things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing. And there was a naivet\u00e9\nabout people. I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about. It\nwas all textbook kind of stuff. Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not\nabout my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and\nchildren. And I said, \"Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too.\" You\n*! The Association of Jewish Workers (French).\nknow, it's not just in the United States that they have invented social work, or that we -- to\nme, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no\nnuances. There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular\narea. Social workers were being trained to work in children's homes in the United States, and\nI did my field work at Bellfaire in Cleveland, which was one of the top-notch child-care\nagencies. They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week. To me,\nit made much more sense to do it the way we did it in France, and that is, train the house\nparents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis. And I couldn't understand.\nWe would train people in France who lived with the children, who were with them all the\ntime. But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a\nweek. And that didn't make sense to me. Does that answer your question? And but more, I\nthink one of the reasons I was just thinking of something. One of the reasons I clamed up,\ntoo, 1s that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened. The\nquestions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid. And it's hard to talk about it. It still\nhappens today. I'll give you an example. Very recently, in Chapel Hill, I was asked to talk to\na junior high school. A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne\nFrank. And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very\nactive in the community there. And could I come and talk about my own experience? And I\ndid, at what I hoped it would be junior high school level -- which is not particularly my forte,\nbut I tried to tailor it to, to them. And especially ask questions. And the kids were wonderful.\nThey really had some very pertinent questions. The teacher, when I recalled the incident of\nbeing arrested and, and Charlotte being put into prison, said, \"But on what basis did they\narrest her?\" And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming! And, and in front of\nthe kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that. I said, \"This 1s war.\nThis is you know, you don't have to have any reason.\" And so on. So in retrospect, I think,\nalso this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it. The other thing is, in Cleveland\nwe really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had\nleft Germany. That's how I met my husband. He's, he's from Germany. He has a whole other\nsaga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it. But there was a group\nof what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this.\nThis was really my circle. One of my very close friends was from Italy. My husband's\nfriends were from Germany. And you didn't have to dwell on these things.\nIt was part of what you brought with you to your daily living. And, and I realized, when I\nstarted talking about it in Syracuse -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in\nSyracuse had a workshop for teachers 1n the public school to teach the Holocaust, to\nintroduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust. And I participated in\nthis workshop. And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that. Again\nthere was, you know, when I say \u201cRivesaltes\u201d to most my, my close friends or the people\nwho come from Europe or come from France, it immediately evokes something. But then I\nhave to go into the detail as to what Rivesaltes, why Rivesaltes, where Rivesaltes, how\nRivesaltes. And it's difficult, and there is this lack of background to do it. It's interesting.\nWhen I went to France, well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to France\nfrom '83 to '86. So I retired from my -- I was teaching at Upstate Medical Center by then, in\nthe pediatric residency program. And I left. I retired. And my clinical practice as well. So\nhere I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people\nI had worked with in the camps, and so forth and so on. And we put together our selected\nmemories. And it was wonderful. And I was asked by a group I became active in WIZO~ --\nwhich is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time\nfor this kind of thing. But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a\nprogram of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience. It surprised me. But\nthen I realized there's a new generation. And they were mostly Jews from North Africa,\nbecause the Sephardic community is so much bigger in France today than it's ever been. And\nthese Jews had all been coming in the '50s -- after the war -- and they didn't know. Yet, at the\nsame time, there was a physical closeness being there in Europe. And when I said\n\u201cRivesaltes,\u201d or when I say and name any place, there is some response, which made it\neasier for me to talk there. And even to talk here. And that, that's a reality.",
        "Q: Is there anything you would like to add?",
        "A: Yes. I'll probably think about it tonight. I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to\ndo this, to give these talks in the first person. And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's\nthe only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in Chapel Hill\nrecently relate to exp-- pieces of experience. Each one comes away with another little piece,\nnot the whole. And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to\nanything that's fictionalized about the sho\u2019ah,\u201d\u201d the television series on the sho\u2019ah, or\nanything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch. To me, it's not\nthe real stuff. And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real\nstuff. And maybe something remains for them. I feel that responsibility. I really do.",

        "A: My full name is Simone Marguerite Lipman. My maiden name was Weil -- W-E-I-L.\nSimone Weil.",
        "A: I was actually born in a very little village in Alsace, near Strasbourg. I was born on April\n22nd, 1920.",
        "A: The name of the village was Ringendorf. In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't\neven fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps, it had a Jewish community. It had a\nsynagogue which, of course, was destroyed during the war. And I -- the house in which I was\nborn is in shambles, but it's still there. My family moved to Strasbourg in -- when I was three\nyears old. My father was a sheep raiser, a very unusual kind of a profession for -- occupation\nfor a Jew. His father, whom I never knew, was a butcher. They're all family of Jewish\nbutchers, but he broke out of there, \u2018though he had barely, probably, a sixth grade education,\nand he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the east. So I grew up in\nStrasbourg, which was a vibrant, vibrant and dynamic, Jewish community. I have a brother --\nI should say, I had a brother, because he died some 14 years ago after loosing his son in the\nYom Kippur War in Israel. My brother was just a year younger than myself, and both of us\nwere very active in, in the Jewish youth movement, which were the Jewish scouting\nmovement, Les Eclaireurs Isra\u00e9lites de France.\u2019 Les \"EIF,\" as we called them.\nAnd I'm going to refer to them many times in this hour to come. I also got a very solid\nJewish education there -- very unusual for girls my age. I went to Talmud Torah all through\nmy high school, and was very active in things Jewish. And particularly, as I said, in the\nJewish youth movement, the scouts, where I was a leader and had leadership training. I went\ninto the lyc\u00e9e,\u201d like all kids my age. I got a good classical education, I suppose. In those\ndays, it was the typical classical education: studying Latin and Greek and philosophy,\nwhatever. But when I finished high school and got my baccalaureate in 1938, I wanted to\nbecome a physicist. But somehow I was talked out of it, because the writing was on the wall,\nand somehow was told that was not a thing to do for a Jewish girl, and that it would be better\nin -- to go into something more practical. And so I went into early childhood education, and\nI'm stuck. I mean, I never moved away from that. So I got one year of training, and that's all.\n' The Israeli Scouts of France (French).\n* French grammar or high school, funded by the State (French).\nBut already in 1938, while the Munich Agreements and the debates were going on, my\nparents sent me to safety with my grandmother -- then very close to 80. And I went\nsomewhere in the south of France with her for just a short period. Then things calmed down\nagain and I went back to Strasbourg. And we stayed in Strasbourg. By 19 -- by the end of the\nsummer 1939, of course, we knew war was coming. And again, I was shipped to the center\nof France with my grandmother. I was eighteen years old. But the safety of my grandmother\nwas utmost. That was my ma -- paternal grandmother, lived with us. And I was sent down\nsouth to take care of her.\nIn the meanwhile, Strasbourg, which was the most -- considered the most exposed city of\nFrance 1n spite of the Maginot Line -- was completely evacuated. All the population of\nStrasbourg was evacuated and sent down to the to the P\u00e9rigeaux, to the Department of the\nDordogne. But somehow, because my parents had their own private means, they did not join\nthe flow of refugees going down south and they went near Nancy, where they rented a house.\nNow, here I am south with my grandmother and -- when things settled down. But because\nyou had relatives, somehow it was they were able to get in touch with me. And so I returned\nto Blamont, where my parents were living, with my grandmother. And there we were\nwaiting for the war to finish. We had just with us whatever we needed. And when the winter\ncame, we needed some more clothes. And I remember to this day, going with a \"safe-\nconduct\" -- that what you call it? A \"sauf-conduit.\"\u201d And we went into Strasbourg, my\nbrother and I. It was a ghost town with just cats and dogs in there, and we got some winter\nclothes and went back to Blamont. In the meanwhile, I took a job in Paris, in, in a private\nschool, to -- because I had had some training in early childhood education. And I worked\nthere, while the bombs, the bombings were starting, and taught in the shelters, and so forth\nand so on. But that lasted a very short period, because my mother took sick, and I returned to\nBlamont in the spring of 1940, just in time for the invasion. And so we were in -- I think the\ninvasion is four -- the fifth or sixth of May 1940. My very religious family had prepared\neverything for Shabbat, and the first time in their life, they had to take to the road on the\nShabbat. And here we were, loading as much as we could in a car and taking off direction\nunknown, because the Germans were -- had crossed over. Coming through Belgium,\nHolland, and crossing over. And we were very close to the border, so we left. As a matter of\nfact, a neighbor of ours had a car. Was a crippled lady and her daughter. And nobody to\ndrive the car. And I had had two lessons in driving, so I took the wheel, and followed my\nbrother with... And we drove for five days and five nights. We drove with the bombings\ngoing on. These were convoys of people just carrying with them whatever they could. We\nwere fortunate we always find a room for my grandmother. But anyway, we ended up in the\nsomewhere near Vichy, of all places, and we heard that France had surrendered. This was\nJune 6th, 1940. And here we were. Couldn't go any back. Couldn't go any forward. So we\nstopped. And we waited to see what would happen. What would happen was that all the\nJews from Alsace were expelled because France was divided into two zones: the northern\n* Safe-conduct (French).\npart and the southern part, with a demarcation line in between. But Alsace and Lorraine were\nannexed, and became Germany -- became German right away.\nLike they had done so many times before -- before the World War II, before World War I,\nand...and so on. And so all the Jews from Alsace were expelled. And relatives were ma --\nwere coming down over the demarcation line. And my father and my brother managed to\nfind a farm, that is where -- the house of a guard, in a big chateau in the southwest of France\nin P\u00e9rigeaux, in the free zone. And that's where my family settled for the rest of the war.\nthere were, there was -- there were my parents, my grandmother, my brother, myself; and\nthen two uncles, two aunts, two cousins and two German men who had come -- had escaped\nfrom the -- from Germany. And we took them on...on the farm. One of my great guilts about\nthat period is that I wasn't -- I didn't know what was going on. We were -- we felt safe in this\nfarm, where we were going to wait. We were going to have food. And I really didn't know\nwhat was going on. And my family was not very new, were not -- wasn't oriented to this kind\nof thing. And I was -- we were surviving there. I was milking the cows, literally. One\nmorning the gendarme\u2019 came -- the French police, the French gendarme -- and asked for our\ntwo German men. They were rounding them up. And I was so unaware of what was going\non that I went to call them. But one was smart enough, aware enough, to jump out of the\nback in the woods and disappear. And the other one, of course, they took along. To this day I\ndon't know what happened to him. The Jews had to register in the south of -- we never had to\nwear the, the star in the south of France, but as Jews we all had to register with the\nCommisariat aux Affaires Juives\u2019-- the, the special office for Jews. And my parents\nregistered. I suppose I did, too, although I don't remember that particularly. But somehow\nduring this first year there, I got a call -- I got a, I got a letter. I think it was a letter. I don't\nthink we had a phone. Certainly we had no transportation. We had no phone. And I got a call\nfrom one of my former leaders in the Jewish scouting movement. And I'm going to mention\nher name, because she's so well known: Andr\u00e9e Salomon is known by everybody for her\nincredible work that she has done in rescuing Jewish children during the war. And had\nalready started doing so in Strasbourg, when all -- when German Jewish parents started to\nsend children across the border for us to... And they were placed in families throughout\nAlsace. And Andr\u00e9e was already the person to take care of them, and to, to see to their\nsafety. How she got in touch with me, I will never know because unfortunately she died a\nfew years ago, before I ever really cleared this up. But she said they -- I was needed in one of\nthe camps, and explained the situation. And this is the first time I knew about camps. And to\nthis day, it's a great guilt that I carry, that I didn't know about these camps. But I packed and I\nleft. Not very much support from my family. I was very distressed because my mother was\nnot terribly well, had taken very hardly all these changes in leaving Strasbourg. But I left. Of\n* Soldiers of the Police Militia (French).\n> The correct name of this bureau is: Commisariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux Questions Juives\n[Commission for Jewish Affairs] (French).\ncourse, there were plenty of people on the farm. And I, and I Just packed my things, and I\nwent to Rivesaltes. Now, I don't know if you want me to go into any explanation as to what\nRivesaltes was. I'm sure you know about Rivesaltes, but I didn't know. And I went there, and\nbecame a resident -- a worker for OSE.\u00b0 At that time, OSE had -- of course, Madame\nSalomon sent them over to there -- another worker, Vivette, and a doctor, Doctor Malkin.\nAnd then there were other organizations that, like the OSE, had resident workers there.\nThere was the Unitarians, the Quakers, the CIMADE,\u2019 and a number of other rescue\nagencies \u2014 Secours Suisse,\u201d particularly. The Swiss Relief Agen...\nI'm not sure exactly what it was called. And the primary job of these agencies was to help\nimprove the conditions of the people there, because the camps hygienic and physical\nconditions were beyond descriptions. The camp was situated in an area where what I\nremember mostly is the wind blowing -- this hot wind called \"La Tramontane,\"\u201d which, the\npeople being so weak from malnutrition, they just rolled along with the wind. They couldn't,\nthey couldn't walk in the wind. Now, in the camp there was still some Spanish refugees from\nthe Franco wars, and in the camps were all the Jews that had been deported from Rhineland,\nfrom areas along the Rhine, on the -- in Germany. Some of them had already been in Gurs,\nanother very infamous camp in the southwest of France, and transferred to Rivesaltes. After\na year of internment, they were in very weakened condition already. Because, although as I\nunderstand it the food that was provided was according to the Geneva Convention, but much\nof it disappeared on the black market. In addition to which, there wasn't much food, period,\nin France. And one of the jobs of OSE, which was originally actually a medical social\nagency, was to provide extra rations for the people. So that became one of the important\ntasks of OSE, to distribute whatever it could. Some day it was milk from the Secours Suisse.\nSometimes it was dates. Sometimes it was a handful of olives. And always a little bread that\nwe had to divide. I shall never forget entering into the barracks and dividing the breads in\neight pieces. And how can you make them exactly equal? So we put numbers of them, so\nthat it was like a, a lottery for people to get the piece of bread. So that no one would be\nslighted, because fights would erupt around the size of a piece of bread. I remember handing\na man in the barrack a piece of bread and his just falling back. And he was dead. That was\nthe condition of the adults. And, of course, the men lived in their own barracks, and the\nwomen in their own.\n\u00b0 Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Organization for Children\u2019s Rescue] (French).\n\u201d Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Inter-Mouvement aupres des Evacu\u00e9s [Committee of Inside-Movement\nrelated to Evacuants] (French).\n* Swiss Rescue (French).\n\u201d North wind; Tramontana (French).\nAnd the children, we tried to keep them in special ilot'\u201d where we kept the children, and tried\nto provide as much as we could for them in terms of extras.

Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later.\nOh, I did food rationing, this food ration distribution; but I took care of the children. I\nremember the first Saturday afternoon, Shabbat afternoon, we gathered. I had two hundred\nand eighty kids for one Oneg Shabbat.'' And I've been trying to do something in one, one\nbig barrack.

So\nthere were teachers, there were rabbis, there were people who, who lent a hand. And we tried\nto provide whatever we could and -- with nothing. Singing, dancing --whatever we could. I\nalso created some groups of girl scouts. I mean, girl scouts in a camp! It sounds ridiculous\nwhen I think of it today, but that's all I knew 1n, in, 1n activities. So I created girl scouts. But\nwhen I have the pictures to show you later, I had -- we organized activities. In the\nmeanwhile, OSE proceeded to get the liberation from the camp of the children under 16.\nAnd some over 16 as well, because you could just work around that a little bit. The\nprocedure is well-known today. I think that the way it was done it was that you could get the\npermissions through some very cooperating officials in the Department de Herault, where\nPerpignan was -- no -- in H\u00e9rault. Not in Perpignan, in a neighboring Department. To get the\nchildren into residence there. And once they were there we could of course disperse them\ninto the very number of children's home that existed, that OSE had set up in the south of\nFrance after having transferred the children from the children's homes around Paris. Because\n-- all nght, I have to back-track a little bit there. OSE had already set children's home up\naround Paris in the late '30s for children who had come from Germany. In fact, I had been\noffered a job in one of these homes and instead went to work in Paris. So we had all these\nchildren's home existing there, and it was a an administrative procedure in trying to get these\nchildren out. But it was not only that.\nIt was it was persuading the parents to let the children go. Mind you, at that time we had not\n-- deportations had not started yet there. They were still -- we are still in the early part of\n1942 now. Yeah, we're still in the early part of 1942, and the deportations haven't started.\nBut there were rumors of shipping the people off to labor camps or resettlement camps. Far\nfrom us was any kind of idea of what -- where they were really sent. But OSE had had the\nforesight, through some people like Andr\u00e9e Salomon and a doctor, Joseph Weill, to think of\nsaving the children and getting them out. And at numerous occasion, I had opportunity to\nconvoy children out or to take children out. I remember one particular group that sticks in\nmy mind of all of it. We had a small group -- but sizeable enough -- of Down's Syndrome\nchildren in the camp. Very young, small Down's Sy -- and there was a place for them in\nBergerac, in the Dordogne, and here we are on the Rivesaltes. I mean, had to cross all the\n'\u201d Small islands, figuratively (French).\n'' Sabbath entertainment, rejoicing, and reception (Hebrew).\nsouth of France. And I took these children by train to Bergerac. There must have been five,\nsix of them. These children had actually learned to walk in the camp, had never known how\nto take steps. And we get to the station, and they didn't know how to go down or up stairs\nbecause they had just never experienced this. In addition to which, they were -- had Down's\nSyndrome. But that's the one convoy I remember, of all of them. I'm not sure exactly why,\nbut I remember this one more than anything else.",
        "A: I only remember that, that -- the steps. What it was on the train, I really don't remember. I\nknow I got them to safety in Bergerac. What happened to them afterwards, I don't know, but\nwe got them out. What I do remember very vividly is the deportations starting. And that was\nin August, I think, of August of '42. It was again a matter of sending people in work camps --\nto work camps, or to resettlement camps. I think we should have known that that wasn't quite\nit, because they were rounding up. I can see this elderly woman on crutches, and I can see\nthe young people and I can see the sick -- all being called out on this enormous empty space\nin the camp of Rivesaltes and crossing the line over as their name was called. I also\nremember this very dignified young Rabbi, who would not hurry this woman on crutches,\nand walking over that empty space. Now, I was very young. And I had learned a lot about\nhumanity while I was in this camp. I learned a lot. I remember one woman, and to this day I\nremember her name. Do you want her name? She was Madame Grynszpan. In fact, she was\nan aunt of the young Grynszpan who, who started things in Kristallnacht because he killed\nthe attach\u00e9 in Paris. And she was always -- in spite of the horrible conditions there, she\nmanaged to have a neat scarf on her head and lipstick on. And she says, \"The day you are\ngoing to see me without my makeup, you know, that's the end for me.\" I know she escaped,\nbecause I -- one day I saw her on the train station in Rivesaltes. And, of course, I made no\neffort to acknowledge that I recognized her, because she had escaped, and so I know she\nescaped. So I -- one thing 1s that I had -- I learned so much from the, the, the dignity and\nsome of the attitude of the people who were living under these horrible conditions. I was, I\nwas very young, and, and it made a tremendous impression on me. I remember these first\nconvoys. The train came to Rivesaltes, to the tracks there, and people were boarded. Now, I\ndo not remember cattle trains. These were regular trains. But what I remember mostly, too,\nwas during that period there were categories of people that could be deported and some who\ncouldn't. There were still categories, because -- gosh, how naive we were -- and thought that\nit was going to continue. If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some --\nor in World War I, I should say that. If you had been born one, one parent, there were\ncategories who were non-Jewish. Or if you had resided for that long in Paris. So we\nscrambled for certificate from concierge to demonstrate that he had -- so and so had lived in\nParis for that period of time. We scrambled for all kinds of documents, sometimes falsifying\nthem somewhat. And I remember, three of us -- I don't remember who the third one was. But\nI know was Jacqueline Levy, with whom I've discussed this very recently. We had all of a\nsudden, people were all in the trains. And we hadn't -- we had these papers to get twenty\npeople out of, of the train. And we went through the train and got these 20 or 21 or 22 people\nout of the camp, because we had these wonderful papers. What we didn't know 1s that there\nwas a quota for that train. And while we scrambled to get twenty people out, twenty other\npeople were rounded up without -- regardless of their status, and were just added to the train.\nWhen I discuss -- I remember discussing this in Paris a few years back with Jacqueline, and\nshe said she shared exactly what I felt. She said when she found that out it was a nightmare\nto realize that the defensive people actually were replacing these people in, you know, in, in\nthe train that we so miraculously saved. Nobody was saved, finally.",
        "A: Be--because we had the papers. We, we didn't choose anybody. We managed to, to put\ntogether a, a record for these people, enough papers to fit the categories. We didn't choose\nanybody. I mean, the papers came through. This certificate and that certificate, and this\ndocument. And we had sufficient documents for these select twenty people. So we didn't\nchoose them. We -- oh, gosh, no. Nobody played God. But that's what -- that's how we got\nthem out of the train, only we were not realizing that actually twenty-odd people would be\nadded to the quota. Can I stop?",
        "A: I need to take something for my headache. It's just getting so bad. I have to take another pill.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Well, during this -- starting in -- as I said, starting in, I think, in August, through September\nand through the end of the year, deportations continued because round-ups of Jews. First it\nwas the foreign-born Jews. Then it was different -- other categories of Jews. And then it was\nJews, period, that were rounded-up. And Rivesaltes became the center from which they were\nsent off to destination unknown. But in the meanwhile, we continued to try to get out as\nmany children as possible through the legal means. And when the legal means didn't work.\nBecause we felt a sense of urgency, sometimes we stood watch at the gates when the trucks\ncame loaded with Jews into the camp, to try to separate the children from the families right\nthen and there so that we could get them in the special barracks for the children and work on\ntheir liberation right away. I mean, in retrospect, to ask the parents who were so bewildered\ncoming into the camp and to separate from their children. And we had them in, 1n, in the\nspecial barracks, where the children worried about their parents, where they saved food for\ntheir parents, where they matured so quickly. They, they -- sort of there was a, a reversal, as\nthey worrying about their parents just like a parent would worry about a child. And we\nbecame also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family\nreunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the homes, the children's\nhomes, to get the children back into the camps for family reunion purposes. So we had to try\nto avoid that as well. Both in the homes, which was impossible when they rounded up the\nkids, but when they came back into the camps. And some, of course, were deported with\ntheir parents. Some under 16, and definitely the over 16 as well. By the end -- I forget\nexactly the date -- when the invasion of North Africa came about by the Allies -- all of\nFrance was occupied. And I remember the Germans coming down south. In fact, coming\nthere had been no Germans in Rivesaltes. This was strictly Vichy government. But when the\nsouth of France was occupied, the Germans came in as well, and then the round-ups started\nharder and harder.\nAnd I remember one particular one on Simchat Torah.'* And on Simchat Torah, the very\nreligious Jews, about to be put into the trucks and from the trucks into the into the trains,\nwere dancing to rejoice with the Torah -- which they didn't have. But this was still a holiday\nthat we're celebrating. And truckloads of Jews were coming in from Belgium and from\nHolland, and from all over. And rounded up all over. And among them, some French-born\nJews. It was just absolutely, at this point, a very -- I imagine they were French Jews; I'm not\nquite sure. But anyway, they were rounded-up, coming into the camp. In the meanwhile, we\ncontinued to get the children out. And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers,\nwho was liberated from the camp and then placed very briefly with the scouts, was\neventually placed into my family to help my parents at the farm. She is still living today in\nIsrael, and is my sister-in-law. She married my brother. This is a girl who was born in France\nof Polish parents, and the parents never bothered to acquire the French nationality. So when\nthe war came, they were all put into Rivesaltes: her two parents, her two brothers. The father\nwas deported right away into forced labor, which means he was sent to his death. The older\nbrother joined the Maquis\u2019 -- the French underground -- and was killed under such horrible\ncondition that I have never found out the details. The younger brother was placed by OSE,\nby one of our network workers; and is living still in Israel. And Rachel living with my\nfamily. And her mother survived -- also helped by OSE. She just died a year ago in Israel. So\nby the end of 1942, there remained but about five hundred people in Rivesaltes. And all the\nkids had been -- whatever kids we could liberate, we had sent into various camps to the\nvarious children's homes, I'm sorry. And, of course, also into the youth facilities of the\nJewish scouts, because they had facilities for over-16s. And, of course, we had to lie about\nthe ages; and, of course, we had to get them out. See, by then we still had not directly\nworked in an underground or in illegal kind of way; except that when the pressure came, we\ntried to help kids escape as much as quickly as we can. I remember always wearing a cape.\nGirl scouts had capes in those days, khaki capes. And you could get a baby under your arms,\nyou know. And you could walk out of the camp with children. The Secours Suisse smuggled\n* Rejoicing of the Torah (Hebrew).\n'\u00b0 Anti-Nazi military partisans, associated with other groups in the French Resistance.\na truck into the camp, and we smuggled children out of the camp under milk cans. And we\nthere are many different stories to tell as how kids came out, and the one I remember mostly\nis the one having children on the -- actually, literally, in my arms under my cape. But I don't\nremember what happened afterwards. We handed them over to another network. Each one of\nus did only one piece of the work. The camp was closed in November or December 1942,\nand whoever was left was sent to Gurs. By that time, I had contracted a horrible jaundice\nbecause of the living conditions there at the camp because we social workers didn't have any\nmore better hygienic conditions than the internees, \u2018though I had an individual room. We had\none barrack where all the workers had an individual room. But we had no toilet facilities.\nAnd we had one bucket that each one of us took turns having in our own room. We also had\nbed bugs infesting everything. And though my parents occasionally sent me some food, it\nwas run over with worms by the time I got it. But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway,\nbecause it was food. And if I ever want to look again in a, in a -- what are they called?\nRutabagas, Rutabagas. Never in my life again ever, anyway.",
        "A: At this time it was not illegal yet.",
        "A: Because I was an accepted French citizen, although Jewish, in the camp. You know, people\nhave asked me, \"Did it ?\" The same kind of question. First of all, you're young. And when\nyou're young, you feel sort of invulnerable and you really don't think beyond what you have\nto do. And I think my the other workers were my age. It was it was sort of a natural thing to\ndo. There was a job to be done. It was a natural thing. I don't know. It just I don't think I\nreally thought much of the risk. It was very interesting; you ask me about risk. The camp\ncommand the commandant of the camp was a police commissar of the neighborhood in\nwhich I had lived in Strasbourg. And he knew my father. I'll talk about him again later.\nThere is a connection there. These people took on jobs which, if, if they had refused to take\non these jobs, if more people had refused to do these kinds of things, maybe, maybe just\nmaybe, things would not have worked out the way they did. For us, I don't know. I guess for\nme the risk I took -- occasional trips to the farm, occasionally. Taking a train to go back to\nthe farm was no excursion. On the trains There were so few trains. I usually traveled with a\nknapsack. And you tried to get your knapsack through a window; and you climbed through a\nwindow, and you stood up all night in the hall. Or I remember standing up all night in the\ntoilets. You know, we were -- there were so few trains, and so little means of transportation.\nSo I did occasionally go back and see my family. I don't not often, but I, I did. What I did,\nactually, when the camp was closed, I had to go back to my family because I was sick. I was\n-- and actually, I went to Gurs. And but I -- by Gurs, by that time, they would not let any new\nworkers come into Gurs. And I remember meeting Dr. Joseph Weill in a train, and he says,\n\"Y ou better take care of your -- \" I was yellow from here, from the top of my head to the\nbottom. And I really had to take a rest. So I did go back to the farm just to recover from that.\nFrom that jaundice or hepatitis, or whatever you'd call it. And when, when I was healthy\nenough again, then I went to work in one of the children's homes. Because I couldn't get into\nGurs, and here were all these children's homes. And I had the background in education early\nchildhood education. So I took a job as the chief educator, for OSE again, near Limoges.\nAnd my family wasn't far.\nThe farm wasn't far from Limoges, in Poulouzat. The Director was Monsieur Job, who later\nbecame one of the administrator of OSE, who's still alive in Paris, whom I still correspond\nwith, whom I still see when I'm in Paris. And here we were, taking care of the children\nwhom we had gotten out of the camp. This was a home that catered to maybe 50 children of\nall ages. And we tried to make the children as live as normal a life as possible -- \"normal\" in\nquotation marks. Again, the food situation was terrible. I remember sorting out rice in which\nmice had gotten. And taking out the, the rice doo. Is that what you call it? If it's dog doo, it's\nrice mice doo. We ate it, because that's all we had. And making do. And, and yet, and, and\ncutting out things of the papers to decorate the rooms. And, and I worked at creating as\nJewish an atmosphere as we possibly could, leading Shabbat services. Because of my\nbackground, this was no problem. I could do these things very easily. And I tutored some of\nthe kids who had missed schoolings, some who were prepare preparing their baccalaureate.\u201d\nThey went to school. They went to public school, but still under their real names. And this is\n1943. I also remember that the drama coach who came on weekends or whatever to teach to,\nto take care of the kids, was Marcel Marceau, of all people. Whose real name is not Marcel\nMarceau, but whose real name is Marcel Mangel (ph), and who was a kid from my\nneighborhood in Strasbourg. And so we had the best. He was a student at that time, doing\nartwork in Limoges.\nBut these were these were my peers. You know, he's a little bit younger than I am. But by\nthat time the OSE Direction had seen the writing on the wall. Some children's homes had\nbeen rounded up. The police was coming to pick up the over-16. The police -- the French\npolice I'm talking about -- was finding these very easy targets, because here was a group of\nJewish children. So at that time, the OSE Direction had decided that the children had to get\nout of the homes in two steps. There was one step: they was under their real names, into non-\nJewish kind of settings, but mostly, to form a clandestine network and place the children\nunder assumed names. And workers were recruited for that, and I was one of them. what\n* Tn France, this is the equivalent of a high school diploma.\nwere the qualifications? None, really. Wanting to do it, but also not being not looking\n\"Jewish.\" Quote, unquote. I mean, there are some people who just simply couldn't do it\nbecause they were \"typ\u00e9s,\"\u201d as we called it. And so I qualified. And Georges Garel, who is\norganized this clandestine network for OSE, recruited me in Poulouzat in children's home\nwhere I worked because all the children's homes were going to be closed. In the meanwhile,\nthere had been arr\u00e9tes -- arrests -- in the Direction of OSE and the various offices. There had\nbeen really -- 1t was danger with knowing where the children were, and so on. So I got\nrecruited for this. And this was towards the end of '43. I therefore left the children's home,\nand took up residence in Chateauroux. Chateauroux is about what -- 60, 75 miles north of\nLimoges. Well, I had to change identity. And my name was Simone Weil, and I decided on\n\"Werlin (ph),\" because it was sort of easy to change the \"I\" to an \"R\" and to add something\nat the end of it. And I had to work on getting, number one, a nationality -- a Fiche de\nNationalit\u00e9.'\u00b0 I'm not quite sure how I got it, but I have it. And from that on -- oh, and I made\nmyself being born in Toul, because we -- I knew that in Toul, the, the city hall had been\nbombed and all the documents had disappeared. And by then, there was really a whole\nnetwork of people working in forging false papers. So we had access to identification cards,\nblank ones and so forth. But I did it, really, the legal way. After I had a Fiche de Nationalit\u00e9\nby which I think I got by just making a statement -- then I had that, claiming that papers had\ndisappeared. I couldn't produce a birth certificate. I got an identification card and gave a\nLimoges address, and immediately then moved to Chateauroux. And had myself registered\nin Chateauroux. So it was perfectly legal. I mean, it was perfectly ok. The most wonderful\nthing -- my nose. The most wonderful thing that helped me in the forging my identity was\nthe help I got from the Director of the school of social work and the director of the school of\nearly childhood education. One lived in Clermont-Ferrand. One lived in Paris. I took the trip,\nand I just simply told them that I needed their help.\nAnd I have in my documents still a certificate stating that I that Simone Werlin was their\nstudent in 1938. I got a certifi-- I got a diploma established in on that name, under my false\nname. And I got some others you know, other statements to that effect. And to this day, I am\nconvinced that at the time I was arrested, to which I'm going to come later, that these papers\nhelped me. And these people, without, without any question, just established these papers for\nme. In fact, I went to Paris. I remember very well, because this is the first trme I saw people\nwearing the yellow star because we did not wear it in the south of France. I also needed a\ncover. And the Department of Public Health put me on their fictitious payroll, I suppose. But\nI had a statement saying that Simone Werlin is employed by the Department of Public\nHealth. And just to make sure that I knew what I was, what the Department of Public Health\nwas, I went at least there once. And now comes a funny story. You know what department\nwas assigned to? The department that checked the health of the prostitutes of the city of\nChateauroux. And they were coming regularly to that clinic to be examined, and that was my\n\u00b0 Typed or stereotyped (French).\n'\u00ae Nationality card (French).\nassignment. But at least I knew what my assignment was so that later on I had to describe it,\nI could describe it. But it has a little funny aspect to it. I got a room, stayed with two elderly\nladies. And we had a team working together in Chateauroux. I remember at least two of\nthem. One was a cousin of mine. And we all had assumed names. And children would come\nto us, brought from various children's home by a worker. Brought to us, for us to change the\nidentity of the kids, and then place them in various foster homes, institutions, families,\nconvents, what have you.\nThis was our job. And transportation was mostly bicycles, train, horse and buggy, whatever.\nOr walking. Whatever we could round up. And it ended up by, by having around\nChateauroux, in that whole area, we had some three hundred and fifty kids placed. The\nDirection of the region was in Limoges, but Chateauroux, in that region, we had between\nthree and 350 kids. It was a matter of finding the places and trying to finding following up\nwith the kids. What I remember most dramatically \u2014 and, and also sometimes through\nChateauroux came groups of children that had to be escorted towards other workers, who\nwould help them get into Switzerland. And I remember one group of children that came one\nnight, and we had to find a place for them overnight. And I in some school or some\ninstitution. And we worked feverishly all night to get them false papers. For the kids. And\ntake out the labels out of their clothes that the mothers had lovingly sewed into their clothes\nand take those labels out. And look through their luggage. Take away whatever they had\nbecause they had to have be safe. And just coach them in what their new identity was. I have\noften said that if I had known then what I have since learned, being a clinical social worker, I\nthink I would have been completely immobilized by the, the traumatization that these\nchildren went through. I could have just not functioned. And it was just a matter of saving\nlives, and that was it. And I remember taking these -- I don't know how many children -- and\nspreading them through a train, and coaching them. Some who spoke French was all right.\nSome who spoke with an accent, they were supposed to be from Alsace. And telling them\nwhat their name was, and knowing how to answer. And getting spreading them through the\ntrain, and getting them across France into Lyons. And there, getting them to another team of\nworkers. That was the end of my mission. And they would then be handed over to somebody\nelse, and gotten into Switzerland. And kids came day and night, and we changed their\nidentity. I remember most I remember two incidents that I want to relate. One of the source\nof help was the Catholic Church. And the area the area close to the Chateau was Bourges,\nwhich has an arch archbishop-- archbishopric. Is that the word? And I went to see the\nArchbishop of Bourges, to ask him for making -- it easy mak-- making the entry into\nconvents and to all Catholic orphanages easy for us. But he knew what was the object of my\nmission, but it was never discussed. I had never encountered an archbishop in my life. And I\nwent to the Archbishop in Bourges, and he gave me a letter of introduction to the various\nCatholic institutions.\nHe also handed my hand with his ring, and I hadn't the slightest idea what I was supposed to\ndo with it. But that was a minor detail. I also worked with Protestant agency that ran summer\ncamps for kids who had to flee Paris. And she also -- this was a partisan social worker in\nBourges, who was very unhappy being in this very Catholic kind of area. And she had no\nidea what the real object of my work was. All I wanted is place children in her summer\ncamps. And I hit it off with her. And because she was so unhappy as a Protestant 1n this\nCatholic environment, taking me for a Catholic we had some discussion which made her say\nthat she had never met such a liberal Catholic as I. I haven't the slightest idea what I said. But\nwhen the dis-- when the questions became too difficult, I managed to escape by pretending\nthat I wasn't feeling well and going to the bath. But anyway, we had the openings to these\ncamps, summer camps, for our children, and that's where we placed them. I worked at that\ntime with another worker, who was actually not Jewish, Ann-Marie, and with two other\nworkers who were not Jewish, among in our team, as well. At one time and at one time and,\nof course, the as the war was drawing closer and closer to an end, the round-ups just\ncontinued. Both my parents were arrested at the farm. And \u2018though I had -- by that time, the\nuncles and aunts had left; and there was just my both my parents, my grandmother, my\nbrother and, and the girl we had placed, you know, who placed from, from Rivesaltes. The\nuncles and aunts had gone elsewhere, found their own place. And I had provided my parents\nwith false papers. But, when in the spring of 1944, the gendarmes came up and said to my\nfather, \"Etes-vous Juif, Monsieur?\"\"\u2019 He said, \"Out, Monsieur.\"\"\u00ae And they took both my\nmother and my father, leaving -- and my brother pretended that he was the farm hand, and\nmy sist-- my future sister-in-law, too. She was the maid, she pretended. And both my parents\nwere interned in a camp near the farm.\nBut the French police actually went over and beyond the expectations of the German\nauthority, and had taken my mother to a camp that was only for men. So after 24 hours, they\nsent her back to the farm. And she survived. And I had heard had word of my father being in\nthat camp. So I -- oh, I always traveled in something that looked like a Red Cross uniform.\nSomething navy-bluish, and some Red Cross sign. I mean, it was really nothing real, but it\nlooked like a uniform, so I had access to the camp there. And through some cigarettes or\ntobacco or something, I got a message to my father. Who, by the way, survived. Because on\nD-Day 1944, the camp was attacked by the Maquis and the internees were able to escape --\namong which my father who returned to the farm. But in the meanwhile, there was great\nconcern for my grandmother. And I managed to come back, round-up a truck from the\nMaquis -- from the underground -- and load my grandmother into the truck and get her to\nP\u00e9rigueux, the city near the, the city prefecture where we lived, and get her into an old age\nhome. And a very nice gentile woman would visit her regularly there. But aside from the\nother work that I did, it was one of the most dramatic things that I did because she was nearly\nblind. And she said, \"Don't leave me here!\" And the bed was on the wrong side and she\n'T \u201cAre you French, Sir?\u201d (French).\n'S \u201cVes, Sir.\u201d (French).\ncouldn't find her things, but I had no choice. I left her, but she survived. Not very long. She\nnever came back to Alsace, but she did survive the, the this period of the old age home. Also\nwhen I was in Chateauroux, you know, Georges Garel, the head of our network, would\nappear from time to time. And he appeared one morning, having come from God knows\nwhere. And coming to that room which I rented and say, \"You know, we have to move very\nfast. The members of the Jewish Committee in P\u00e9rigueux have all been shot as in reprisal for\nGod knows what had happened to some German. The Director one of the Directors,\nMonsieur Lederman, has been shot. He has -- his wife has had died the year before of cancer.\nAnd he has two daughters in a private boarding school, and we have to get them out of\nthere.\" What he didn't know...that Monsieur Lederman was my uncle. And these were my\ncousins. And they were two young teenagers, and I called them. I had the number. How we\ngot calls through is a puzzle to me today; but the phone must have functioned. And I called\nthem in the school in which they were. And I told them, \"You pack up, and you go. And you\ncome to Chateauroux, and I'll be at the station.\" And I was there. And they came. And there\nwas a curfew. I don't know how I made it through the curfew. And we got them into a safe\nhome we had at Chateauroux.; there was gentile lady who loaned us the apartment where we\ncould do our papers. So I remember changing their name to Ledormier. And while we were\nthere, I do remember the Milice\u2019\u201d coming. But the Milice didn't come to -- they didn't know.\nThey were just looking at apartments. But they came, and I jumped out the back window\nwith my two cousins. And also Ann-Marie tells me it was the paper of her husband who had\nbeen deported to Auschwitz and who -- whose papers she had. And I don't remember that,\nbut as we put our selected memories together, we reconstructed. And I reconstructed the\nevents. As a matter of fact, while I was in France I found that hou-- that house again. And I\nknew it was it because I saw the windows from which we jumped. But anyway, the girls\nwere placed into a Catholic convent, and they survived. Last year --",

        "A: So we continue with the story of my cousins, where I left it off. Just a year ago, one of my\ncousins came to see me in Chapel Hill. And she got off the plane. And I waited for her. She\nsays, \"This is the second time that you're waiting for me someplace.\" And she remembered\nthe time I was waiting for her at the station. But then she said, \"When you called us in the\nschool where we were to tell us to pack and come, we didn't know whether it was really\nyou.\" Distortion of the telephone. \"And we had really didn't know whether it was a trap for\nus. And whether it was a safe thing to do, to come to Chateauroux, until we saw you at the\nstation.\" And that devastated me. And actually, they did not know their father had been shot.\nAnd they're telling me that I had to tell them that their father had been killed. They thought\nhe had been deported. I do not remember this, nor do I remember so many of the details. I\nhave recently encountered a woman who lives in Richmond, who was a child in Rivesaltes\nwho I got out of Rivesaltes and who I placed in a convent later on and went back to work\nwith me in a children's home that I had later. She survived this way. Her family was\ndeported. And she went to the United States soon after that. And she gives me all these\ndetails. And I believe her because it fits into what I remember, but I don't remember her, and\nI don't remember the details of it. I do not remember individuals as such. I remember my\ncousins. That's somewhat in some way different -- it's very close to me. I see myself going\ninto farms. I see myself talking to children, talking to families. I remember the incident of\nthe, the Archbishop in Bourges. I remember being arrested -- and I'm going to come into that\nin a minute. But the individual kids, I do not remember. Exc-- I remember the groups, and\nnot one in particular. I do remember the one day that I went to Limoges on my bicycle. 75\nmiles. In my memory, it was a straight route to Limoges. Six or seven years ago, we went\nback there. I told my husband, \"Don't worry, it's...\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]\nYou started to tell me about the trip.",
        "A: On regular intervals, I guess, I had to go to Limoges, which was really the headquarters of\nthis area. And I remember some of the workers there having to do with papers, or having to\ndo with whatever instructions we had about our network, our children. And I remember\nwalking with this other worker in Limoges, in the city. And treating ourselves to some of\nthese coupon-free pastries. We had to -- we could go into a pastry shop, and they had made\nsome pastry out of some God knows what ersatz stuff. And coming out of it, and a young\nman coming to us, and saying, \"Follow me.\" And opening the big book he had under his\narm, which was not a book but something that hid a box with a revolver in it. The -- 1t was\nclear that they were not after me as well as after Charlotte. Charlotte was living in -- she\nlooked very Jewish, by the way. She was very \"typ\u00e9e.\" And they suspected her to be part of\nthe Resistance. And he marched us with this gun under his arm to her apartment. And there,\nransacked her apartment, looking for I'm not sure what. But I had sewn in the lining of my\npocket some seals, to make false papers. You know, of city halls and town halls, and dates\nand stuff. I also had, on cigarette paper, the coded list of my children, because -- I didn't\nmention this earlier. OSE had a list of the children with their real names and their false\nnames, with copies in Geneva. Not one identity was ever lost. Some children were lost,\nunfortunately. But no identity ever got lost. And we had codes in which way we were\nkeeping lists. I mean, these identities available. And I had that with me. And here I was,\nwatching calmly as they were ransacking Charlotte's apartment, and trying finding a way of\ngetting at least rid of this incrim-- incriminating documents I had on me. So I asked to go to\nthe bathroom. And what I know how to do was to act as a very innocent little girl. I think I\ncan still do it. And they let me go. And that simple little slip, on their part, saved me. I went\nto the bathroom, got everything out of the lining of my pocket, got the papers out, flushed\nwhatever I could down the toilets, threw everything that I could out of the windows, and\ncame back into the room clear of all this incriminating stuff. I knew that, you know, we'd get\nsome other seals and we'd get the lists. They were saved somewhere else. Legend has it\nalready that I swallowed the cigarette papers. But I'm sure I didn't. I'm sure I threw them out.\nI get back and they went through my papers. And this is where I want to come back to the\nwonderful paper I had. I always carried with me all these document that these very helpful\npeople had made out for me -- my diplomas, my cert-- I had everything with me. Library\ncards which had false from pre-war library cards, under my false name. I had university\nstudent cards, and etc. I had all this with me. They slipped on one thing, which have which\nwould have been my undoing. I had given an address in Limoges as my original. I had my\nidentification card. I didn't even know where the street was. I didn't even know whether it\nexisted. If they had asked me to take them there, I couldn't have done it. But they didn't. So I\nleft this place. they imprisoned Charlotte, but we managed to liberate her to help her escape.\nAnd she's still living.",
        "A: I don't -- we didn't. I wasn't part of that. The resident workers in Limoges managed. I don't\nknow how they did it. I haven't the slightest idea. I was very anxious to retrieve my\nknapsack, which had a lot of incriminating papers in it. And so I got in touch with another\nworker, who first went to where my knapsack was parked -- I don't remember where -- and\ngot out all the stuff that was in there that would have been incriminating. And then I got my\nknapsack back, and then I went back on bicycle 75 miles to Chateauroux. Now, just a few\nyears ago in Paris, I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, \"Oh, I\nknow who you are. You spent the night. You were arrested in my room.\" I don't remember. I\nhave absolutely no memory of it. She remembered the incident. She remembers Charlotte,\nand how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued Charlotte. I don't know how. I\ndon't know how. But for me, I was anxious to get out of Limoges with my cleansed\nknapsack. I remember this as a straight route to Limoges. And I took it a few years back, and\nit was the rollercoast-- the worst rollercoaster road. And my husband said to me, \"This 1s a\nstraight road?\" In my memory, this was a straight road. So I came back to Chateauroux. And\nno sooner did I get to my room that my landlady says, \"Your friends from Limoges came to\nsee you, and you were not home.\" Needless to say that I spent no time in Chateauroux, and\ntook my bicycle and went on to Bourges, where I had somebody else. But you see, it wasn't\nalways bicycle. Whenever we could, we took a train and put the bicycle in the luggage\ncompartment. And we went as far as we could on the train, on where the Maquis had blown\nup the tracks, we had to get out. We were always rejoicing when the tracks were blown up.\nSo we took the bike, and we went a little bit further. So that way, we, we traveled. So I went\nto Bourges. And I even remember getting a horse and buggy part of the way, putting the\nbicycle in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from\nLimoges were, were sure that I was somewhat safe. There's another crazy incident that I do\nremember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of Rivesaltes was the\nCommissar de Police from Strasbourg. He ended up being the Commissar de Police of\nChateauroux, where I was doing underground work. And I did something which today seems\nabsolutely crazy to me. I went to him. And I told him, \"I know you know who I am.\" But I\ntold him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing. And I was expecting\nhim to leave me alone. In retrospect, 1t sounds absolutely totally crazy. But he never\nbothered me. It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you\nknow, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you\nknow, \"See what I did for you?!\" But at that time I went to my superiors at OSE, who says,\n\"He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the\ncommandant of the camp of Rivesaltes and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been,\nyou know, more to his credit.\"\nSo, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, \u201cHow did it feel?\u201d I got a\nsense of invulnerability. Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring. And\nyou, you feel I could wear these uniforms of Red Cross, or doing and, and just pretend and\ndo anything. And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers\ndoing it. All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was\nin the in the escape, the routes to Spain or to, to Switzerland -- or whether it was in the in the\nMaquis. Whatever. We did it because that was the thing to do. That brings us pretty much to\nalmost the end of the war -- no. I remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944. I thought it was all\nover. It wasn't over by far. And I put my the gold little flag on my bicycle, but very quickly\nput it back in. You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very\ngood Catholic girl. In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to church every Sunday morning in\nthe back of the church. But anyway, it was too early to really tell them. I was I was just\nexploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies\nhad landed, that didn't mean at all that France was liberated. And then the fierce battling\nwent on -- the bombings. I was part of the Red Cross emergency teams, where we went\nwhen there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble.\nThis was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or\nanything. It was just a community work. And that went on. And as reprisals, very nearby was\nthis horrible incident of Oradour-sur-Glane, where the Germans locked up the whole\npopulation in a church and put fire to the church. This was non-Jews as well as Jews. I mean,\nit had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the\nwar and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way. But don't ask me\nthe details of how it happened. I know it happened. I know we did it. I know I did it, but I\ndon't remember the details. I don't remember. More kids coming, and I know we placed\nmore kids. It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over. I, I\nknow this was a, a very hectic period. I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish\ngirls celebrating Passover that spring, in the basement. And one of us watching, standing\nguard at the door, just like Marrano-type kind of celebration. These, some of these little\ndetails come up once in a while. But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really,\nas to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories. With very few\nexceptions, I don't. My sister-in-law, those of my cousins. And the only explanation I can\ncome up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals,\nfor fear of loss, for fear of getting too close. And so that I do not remember individual\nstories, with the few exceptions that I gave you. Also is I left the United -- I left France in\n1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly. And I had one urge and that 1s to put\neverything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war. I never spoke\nFrench to my children, never talked about any of that story. It was all something to put\nbehind me. And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us\nwho feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories.\nWhen the war was over in our in my area, Limoges and Chateauroux, in the fall of 19-- oh,\njust before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that\nconvent, and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on\nGod knows what trucks. And from one stage to the other, and got them back to the farm.\nBecause that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had,\nhaving lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to\nspend there. Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their homes, and I\nreopened the first home in Montintin, in the center of France. It was a big old chateau which\nhad been a children's home before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period. And it\nwas populated by rats and by filth. And we cleaned the rats. To today, I stand on a chair if I\nsee a mouse. In those days, we put traps in, and we caught one rat after another, and we\ncleansed it. And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience. And we got as quickly as\nwe could the children out of the religious institutions, of the Catholic institutions. And we\nhad no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be\nuntil the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the death camps that we\nreally had the reality of what had happened. So we did the best we could to create as quickly\nas we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children. With nothing. With whatever\nwe could. We had staff survive -- survivors. I remember particularly one couple from\nHolland who had survived. And I had really a desire to do something in my field, and that is,\ncreate a home for pre-school children. Because pre-school is, was and has always been -- and\ncontinues to be -- my area of interest. And OSE then replaced, replaced me at Montintin.\nAnd I went to Paris; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in Rivesaltes -- but not\nfor OSE, but for the Unitarians. Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the\nauspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful model home for pre-school age children. Later on,\nwhen I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really\ncopied -- we copies...no, we didn't copy it.\nWe initiated the same model. And these children had survived tn hiding -- but not only\nchildren who had survived in hiding. Children who were entrusted to us by parents who\ncouldn't handle them. They had survived themselves, but they were alone. And for a period\nof time, we had these children. But it was also a training school for early childhood\neducators. Actually, my diploma was in Montessori education. So we set up a Montessori\nprogram in, in the -- in a chateau near Paris, which, by coincidence, happens to be the one\nwhere I had taught in a private school before the war. It was a beautiful place, surrounded by\nground. And there I stayed until -- this was '45 -- and all the do-gooders from the United\nStates came over. Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes. A WAAC\u201d\ngave me some shoes. That was wonderful! And they brought us candy, and they brought us\nall kinds of stuff. But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come\nto the States to continue my training, to go back to France and continue on with my work. To\ntell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the moon. I would have gone anywhere.\nThis was it. Was I was ready for a change. And why me? Why not Jacqueline? Jacqueline\ndidn't know English. She was just as qualified, but I knew English. This was a scholarship\noffered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships\nto give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in\nEurope, not just in France. And would return to their countries to continue to improve the\nsituation. So I had a very hard time. It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon\nletters upon letters to get me a place on a boat, and I came on a warship in 1946. And the\nCouncil of Jewish Women sent me to Tulane University. And for one year, but extended my\nscholarship for a second year, which I completed in Cleveland, and got my Master's Degree\nin social work. But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband. But I did return to\n** Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC after 1978).\nFrance before we got married, and worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. And there I\nam worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these children's homes\nand all these children had to reassess the needs of these children. And I did survey upon\nsurvey of facilities -- not just OSE of various children's homes -- to assess their need and to\nsee what else could be done with the children. And I also set up L'Association des\nTravailleurs Juives~\u2019. I started with training workers in the various homes, with my newly\nacquired wisdom in social work. And I started this program going, going through the JDC.\nAnd my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the\nStates. And after a year, I came back to the States. And that's the end of the story, I guess. I\ncontinued in social work for the rest of my life.",
        "A: Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there. It's interesting. When I went to\nTulane University I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in\nmy own work and in my own experience. And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no\nintention of getting a degree. It was just a year to be exposed to things here. So I didn't work\nvery hard. I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange. Why talk\nabout my war experience? Everybody else had done it. And why did I have to talk about it?\nAnd yet I did because I was their first student. And I went to their triennial conventions, and\nI talked about it. I don't know what I said and how I told the story then. There was a lot of\npublicity. And it bothered me for two reasons. One, because as I said, 1t seemed so natural to\nhave done that. I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it. Everybody did it, in\nmy mind. And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save. And how\ncan you sort of make it this beautiful story? There was just one other thing is that there were\nthere was a program of Ship-a-Box the Council of Jewish Women had. And I accepted to\ntalk, provided they sent packages overseas. And that was one of the, you know, redeeming\nfeatures of my talking. When I transferred to Case Western -- no. It wasn't Case Western, it\nwas Western Reserve University. I got a somewhat different experience. And yet, I\nremember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had\nbeen or what, what my expertise. I mean, after all, I had left I was By then, I was 26 years\nold. I was not a kid fresh out of high school. I mean, this was graduate school because I got\ncredit for all my work I had done. And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all. I\ndidn't find -- what surprised me very much 1s the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds\nof things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing. And there was a naivet\u00e9\nabout people. I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about. It\nwas all textbook kind of stuff. Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not\nabout my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and\nchildren. And I said, \"Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too.\" You\n*! The Association of Jewish Workers (French).\nknow, it's not just in the United States that they have invented social work, or that we -- to\nme, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no\nnuances. There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular\narea. Social workers were being trained to work in children's homes in the United States, and\nI did my field work at Bellfaire in Cleveland, which was one of the top-notch child-care\nagencies. They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week. To me,\nit made much more sense to do it the way we did it in France, and that is, train the house\nparents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis. And I couldn't understand.\nWe would train people in France who lived with the children, who were with them all the\ntime. But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a\nweek. And that didn't make sense to me. Does that answer your question? And but more, I\nthink one of the reasons I was just thinking of something. One of the reasons I clamed up,\ntoo, 1s that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened. The\nquestions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid. And it's hard to talk about it. It still\nhappens today. I'll give you an example. Very recently, in Chapel Hill, I was asked to talk to\na junior high school. A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne\nFrank. And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very\nactive in the community there. And could I come and talk about my own experience? And I\ndid, at what I hoped it would be junior high school level -- which is not particularly my forte,\nbut I tried to tailor it to, to them. And especially ask questions. And the kids were wonderful.\nThey really had some very pertinent questions. The teacher, when I recalled the incident of\nbeing arrested and, and Charlotte being put into prison, said, \"But on what basis did they\narrest her?\" And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming! And, and in front of\nthe kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that. I said, \"This 1s war.\nThis is you know, you don't have to have any reason.\" And so on. So in retrospect, I think,\nalso this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it. The other thing is, in Cleveland\nwe really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had\nleft Germany. That's how I met my husband. He's, he's from Germany. He has a whole other\nsaga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it. But there was a group\nof what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this.\nThis was really my circle. One of my very close friends was from Italy. My husband's\nfriends were from Germany. And you didn't have to dwell on these things.\nIt was part of what you brought with you to your daily living. And, and I realized, when I\nstarted talking about it in Syracuse -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in\nSyracuse had a workshop for teachers 1n the public school to teach the Holocaust, to\nintroduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust. And I participated in\nthis workshop. And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that. Again\nthere was, you know, when I say \u201cRivesaltes\u201d to most my, my close friends or the people\nwho come from Europe or come from France, it immediately evokes something. But then I\nhave to go into the detail as to what Rivesaltes, why Rivesaltes, where Rivesaltes, how\nRivesaltes. And it's difficult, and there is this lack of background to do it. It's interesting.\nWhen I went to France, well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to France\nfrom '83 to '86. So I retired from my -- I was teaching at Upstate Medical Center by then, in\nthe pediatric residency program. And I left. I retired. And my clinical practice as well. So\nhere I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people\nI had worked with in the camps, and so forth and so on. And we put together our selected\nmemories. And it was wonderful. And I was asked by a group I became active in WIZO~ --\nwhich is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time\nfor this kind of thing. But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a\nprogram of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience. It surprised me. But\nthen I realized there's a new generation. And they were mostly Jews from North Africa,\nbecause the Sephardic community is so much bigger in France today than it's ever been. And\nthese Jews had all been coming in the '50s -- after the war -- and they didn't know. Yet, at the\nsame time, there was a physical closeness being there in Europe. And when I said\n\u201cRivesaltes,\u201d or when I say and name any place, there is some response, which made it\neasier for me to talk there. And even to talk here. And that, that's a reality.",
        "A: Yes. I'll probably think about it tonight. I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to\ndo this, to give these talks in the first person. And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's\nthe only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in Chapel Hill\nrecently relate to exp-- pieces of experience. Each one comes away with another little piece,\nnot the whole. And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to\nanything that's fictionalized about the sho\u2019ah,\u201d\u201d the television series on the sho\u2019ah, or\nanything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch. To me, it's not\nthe real stuff. And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real\nstuff. And maybe something remains for them. I feel that responsibility. I really do.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n** Women\u2019s International Zionist Organization\n*\u00b0 Holocaust (Hebrew).\nNote: This section, the section on photographs and documents, has not been checked for accuracy,\nspelling, or authenticity.\nDOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS\n(1) This is the diploma of early childhood educator, which I recetved under my real name in\n1940, I believe.\n(2) This certificate was given to me by the same director of the school of, of early childhood\neducation in 1943; giving it to me under my then assumed name and pre-dating it to 1938,\n'39 and '40.
