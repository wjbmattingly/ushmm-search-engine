The United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this\ninterview possible. This is tape number one, side A. So my first question is an easy one.\nGive us your name, and when were you bo -- or your names, and when you were born,\nand where.",
        "Answer: My name is Marsha Loen, Marsh Supporzhnikov Loen. My maiden name was\nSupporzhnikov. I was born in Lithuania, Kolnos. In fact, the outskirts of Kolnos,\nLabotkia. And I was born in 1930, July 28.",
        "Q: And when did liberation come for you, and what was it like? What state of mind, what\nphysical health were you in, and where were you?",
        "A: I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little\ncamps out of Stutthof were concentrated. And the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you\nthe honest truth, I don\u2019t remember when I was liberated. I thought they were burning\ndown the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead\naround me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian\u2019s doctor taking care of\nme. I had the two typhuses. And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on\nit, and I looked like musselwoman. And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize\nanything. And after three days, or a week, I don\u2019t know exactly, they told us we have to\nleave that village, because the front 1s coming on. So we should walk to Lomborg.\nLomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from Chinno. And as we were walking, I with\na little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will\nnever forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to\ntake us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we --\nthey shouldn\u2019t notice that we have typhus. And they said, \u201cNo, we cannot do it, because\nwe are not allowed to.\u201d But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us\nbehind, in that little carriage, but they said, \u201cThe first house in Lomborg, you have to get\nout.\u201d So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out. So, we\nwent out, and the first house we walked in. And all I can remember is everything was\nempty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don\u2019t know, at that time I\ndidn\u2019t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. And in the middle was\nstanding a bottle, with blueberries. And I didn\u2019t know it was preserve, or something.\nThere was no water in that house, nothing. And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we\nhad a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. And sh -- she said, \u201cShall\nwe drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cI am afraid it may be poisoned.\u201d Left poison, there\u2019s that bottle\nstanding there, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s nothing. And then we couldn\u2019t stand it any more,\nand what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so\nyoung, I didn\u2019t know nothing. Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we\nfelt so much better, that it was fermemented. It was set up for wine, or something, and it\nhelped the temperature. And our temperature dropped. We s -- we went around, and we\nlooked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized\nsome people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two\nweeks, three weeks, they\u2019re grown up people. And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for\nthem, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the\nwomen. German, Jewish, it didn\u2019t matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So\nwhat they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where\nthey lived, six women. And if you put a sign up that it\u2019s typhus, the Russians didn\u2019t care,\nthey just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. And what happened\nis -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave\nme a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light,\nand the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was\ntyphus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick\nwith the salve on my head. They start running. And this is how I saved six women from\nbeing raped by the Russians. Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going\ndown the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn\u2019t that\nmuch water, and anything, and I thought I\u2019Il wash out my -- whatever I have, in that\npond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me,\nand I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.\nHe said, \u201cAteeja dofka.\u201d I mean, am -- am I Jewish. And I said yes. He said, \u201cI am too,\nfrom Odessa, don\u2019t get scared.\u201d So I took him up into the apartment where the girls were.\nThey saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d\nYou know, they dragged me back in the other room. And it so happened that it -- he was\nthere for two weeks. He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. He gave me even a\nwedding band. And I wasn\u2019t even 15 years old yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to\nme he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la --\nhis father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought\nto myself, \u201cLet him talk.\u201d But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two\nweeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in. And when he\nleft, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. So we slept there, so\nnobody could touch us there either. And one day a man came up to me, and he said,\n\u201c\u201cAkeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?\u201d Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma --\nMarioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. \u201cMy son wrote a letter at home that you are\nhere in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital. I would\nlike to send you to Odessa. He wants to marry you.\u201d And I told him, I said, \u201cI cannot do\nit. | have to go back home first. I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have\nanything,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cDo you love my son?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know him well enough.\nI don\u2019t know what love 1s.\u201d Is -- I -- he didn\u2019t know my age, he didn\u2019t know nothing.\nNobody know nothing about anybody. And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age,\nbecause my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. And I -- so even\nafter I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age. So, even to that man that was the fa --\nand I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said,\n\u201cTell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your\nson 1s, and you\u2019re not even Jewish?\u201d Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name\nwas, I don\u2019t even remember, and he says, \u201cYou see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and\ndoctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans,\nthat the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn\u2019t give us out that we are Jews on top of it.\u201d\nSo this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn\u2019t the only one that suffered, and there were\nother people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my\nmind. And we felt better, and we didn\u2019t know there was [indecipherable] existed. We\ndidn\u2019t know about people not going back home or nothing. All I want is to go home, and\nsee what\u2019s happened.",
        "Q: Would you let me ask you just one quick question. Did you know anything about your\nfamily members at that point? Are -- you know your sist -- your two sisters -- you said\nyour two sisters were --",
        "A: My two little sister, my mother, was taken away in Stutthof. I didn\u2019t know if they are -\n- were dead, or alive, or nothing. I had a feeling that they were killed there. All taken to\nTheresienstadt. Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to\nAuschwitz. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I can only tell you I lost them, about\nmaybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But the only thing that bothered me 1s that they\nwere taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they\nwere taken away. And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is\nall in my other tape. And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my\nfather was in Dachau. I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and --\nand this -- I knew they were dead. My other family -- certain family members were all\ndead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno\nghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. But the\nthing is 1s, 1s -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home. So they said yes,\nthey\u2019 ll s -- they\u2019Il s -- put us on trains, and they\u2019Il send us home. So they put us on big\ntrucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don\u2019t know how to say it in English, a\nranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not\nfar from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on. And they took us there, and there\nwere some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. And the\nJewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to\nclean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. They\ndidn\u2019t give us enough food, the Russians. They didn\u2019t kill us, they didn\u2019t beat us, but\nthere was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with\nguards, like in the [indecipherable]. The only difference was that we weren\u2019t beaten up,\nwe weren\u2019t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. There were about maybe\n10 Jewish girls. And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would\nlike to go to learn with veterinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach\nveterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields\nthat were running wild. And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese\nfactory. And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they\u2019re\nhealthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came\nback. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if\nthey needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent\nto s -- Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little\nsisters, and the rest of my family. So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, \u201cI am going to\nRigenwald.\u201d We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, 1t must have\nbeen from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl,\nand two Jewish girls. And what happened is is that -- what\u2019s so amazing is that the doctor\nwas a drunk. He was compl -- always drunk. And we learned some. We learned how to\nprotect when a cow 1s slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs.\nWe learned how to take analysis from a horse\u2019s neck. We learned ho -- if they got this\neye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. We learned the cows, they had a certain thing\non their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? It\u2019s a certain\nchemical. Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical. So get away the sickness\nshouldn\u2019t spread. We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most\nimportant thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife, with the\nmain man\u2019s wife. I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before. She\nwent in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others. I -- I told her that\u2019s not\nproper. I told her your hair doesn\u2019t look, let me comb it for you. We got to be the best of\nfriends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife. And they treated me like a daughter the two\nweeks I was -- three weeks we were there. After three weeks we got a paper with a\npitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. Akivia trinarn inyarz. I\nwas a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We came into that village again, we worked.\nWe worked with the horses, we worked this. Two weeks later, after we came back from\nRigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that trench. There\nwas a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. And he\nsaid, \u201cAkdere Marouska?\u201d Where is marsh -- Marouska. And the captain said, \u201cIn her\nroom with the other Jewish girl.\u201d He says, \u201cIn her room? You mean to tell me she doesn\u2019t\nhave an apartment of her own?\u201d And his wife got very mad. He said, \u201cI want to call her\nimmediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.\u201d Because there was dinner in the\ncaptain\u2019s house. It\u2019s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house. So\nwhen he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I\nhave to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory. I have\nto be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything\nprepared, and -- now, don\u2019t forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel\n15. And what happened is 1s before I left for the other -- good for the other ranch, big\nranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the\nstalls. But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have\nkilled me, the Russian girls. So what happened 1s is when I went to that good, I arrived,\nand I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night\nthe Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked 1n, the ranch, from all\nthe ranches they would come, and -- and Polish soldiers they would come, and I would\ngive them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russian soldiers weren\u2019t fed either. They would\ncut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with\npotatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. Everything was shipped to Russia.\nAnd what happened 1s 1s that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the\nPolish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring\nliquor and so on. But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the\nwoman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman. That\u2019s the first time I ate\nwatfles in my life, because she had the stove that she moved waffles around. She was\nfrom Pullman. She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me. So the\nminute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and\nnobody could get near me. But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age\nwouldn\u2019t do. I was boar hunting, believe it or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians,\nwith the Polish officers. I -- I did everything I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride\nout, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron\nwomen, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean\nin the fields and so on.",
        "Q: How did you know how to manage that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It just came natural to me. It just came natural to me. In the beginning I\nwas very ver -- I said I was going to take revenge. In the beginning I was riding my\nhorse, I would see children on the street, I didn\u2019t care, I was ride -- dust, the dirt and\neverything. But then about a month later, I was taking them medicine, and food, I was\nstealing from the Russians, and giving to the poor German kids.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: This is a Jewish heart. We\u2019re a very compassionate people.",
        "Q: So when you got some compassion again, and could build yourself up, then you were\nable to --",
        "A: Not very long -- didn\u2019t take me very long to build up, to feel sorry for those kids, and\ntake them food, and take them medicine, and steal from the Russians. And one day the\ncaptain came to me, and that -- this is a really funny story. He came to me to my village.\nAnd he says, you know there was a befell -- was like when there\u2019s a order that the -- the\nRussians can take nothing away animal from the Germans. Absolutely nothing, no cows,\nno horses, nothing. And the eye sickness of the horses, I forgot how it was called. I was\nnever a veterinarian, so I forgot it. Broke out and we lost seven horses, and they put --\nPolkovnik was coming, and he said, \u201cYour village is full of horses.\u201d He\u2019s talking to a\ngrown up person, you know. \u201cI need seven horses.\u201d I said, \u201cFine, Ill give you seven\nhorses. You release seven see -- seven girls from the -- that you\u2019re holding. If you put\nthem on the train, I\u2019Il give you seven.\u201d Said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that many, but Pll release some.\u201d\nI said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So how do I do it? I have to have a plan. So I sat down, and I talked to the\nGerman woman that took care of me, and I made myself a plan. I am -- I got a lot of\nfantastic liquor from those majors that came, from the -- the pilots from Stettlin. And I\ninvited seven officers from the Polish camp. And we got them so drunk that they were\nflat on the floor. We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers.\nWe put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went\nout, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped\nthem on a cart, and took them back to their camp. The next thing the rumor was in the\nvillage that the Polish army stole seven horses. Now I had something over that captain.\nHe was so afraid of me that you have no idea. Because God forbid he should go to the\nhigher ups, and everything. So everything I wanted, I got. So when the soldiers from each\ncamp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If\nthey wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and\nhe was afraid of me as hell. One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I\u2019Il never\nforget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, \u201cAre y -- do you\nknow anybody by the name of Myashka Supporzhnikov?\u201d And I said to him like that. I\nput my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, \u201cOh please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d And the\nRussian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, \u201cMarouska, don\u2019t\nworry. Anything you want I\u2019ll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some\nmedicine when I was sick. You brought food for me. I will help you with anything I can.\u201d\nA very, very lo -- I couldn\u2019t say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with\nintelligent you have to be born. Very average person, you know? And I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand why he does it. And he said, you know what? So I tell him the story, that I\nfound out from that man that my father is alive in Lodz, in Poland, and he came to pick\nme up. So he said to me, \u201cNot only will I take you -- let you go, but I\u2019Il take you to the\ntrain.\u201d And I want to tell you something. When we came into the villages, the houses\nwere empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras. With everything\nwas in my apartment, when I was riding on that horse, I didn\u2019t even have a sweater on.\nI'll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on. I remember now, I didn\u2019t remember\nbefore, riding boots, and -- and they\u2019re real good boots, because one of the officer, police\nofficer, brought it to me, and riding pants. That\u2019s all I had with me, because I was going\nwith him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going. And I\nsaid, \u201cOkay. You are taking me to the train, but I\u2019m going to give you a letter. And when\nthe captain does something to you, you tell him, \u2018I have a letter from Maroushka about\nthe seven horses.\u2019 \u201d I said, \u201cAt least I can do for you that you don\u2019t get punished, or put\nin jail, or anything like that.\u201d So what I did 1s I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat\ndown, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He took us to the train. And that man says to\nme, \u201cNow remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I\nwant you to be like you\u2019re -- you don\u2019t know how to speak, you don\u2019t know how to --\nyou\u2019re -- you\u2019re dumb. Whatever anybody says, you just move your head.\u201d Because at\nthat time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially\non trains, and so on. And I listened to him, and he might -- I don\u2019t even [indecipherable] I\nwas freezing a little bit. And I went to -- we went with the train and we arrived in Lodz.",
        "Q: When about -- when abouts was that [inaudible] time?",
        "A: That was still in 1945, the end of 1945. I think it was the end of 1940 -- yes, the end of\n1945. And I arrived in Lodz, and that\u2019s in Poland, and I met my father, and I met a lot of\npeople from my town that were left ali -- not a lot, because you know, people that were\nleft over, and of course, my father couldn\u2019t tell me something that I couldn\u2019t do. I was\nsmoking, and he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t smoke.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you mean to tell me I\ncan\u2019t smoke? I can smoke, I can do whatever I want to.\u201d If I thought to myself, maybe at\nthat time -- I don\u2019t know if I thought to myself this way, if I can handle a Po-Polkovnik\n[indecipherable] I can handle my father, you know. If he tells me not to smoke, it\u2019s none\nof his business if I smoke or I don\u2019t smoke. And at that time my father was a tailor, a very\ngood tailor. That what saved our life also in the Kovno ghetto. And he start work. He\nworked in -- in Lodz as a tailor, and he helped a lot of people from Lithuania, from\nKovno that went through Lodz. He had a big apartment, and in -- the one -- that\napartment, downstairs was a big room. I don\u2019t -- it was like a hole. And anybody that\nwent through, went through my fa -- they said, \u201cGo to Beryl Supporzhnikov.\u201d And they\nwent through, and everybody knew him, because he was a very good looking man from\nKovno, very well dressed, and always the best. And th-they came, and he would give\nthem food, and he wouldn\u2019t let them go back to Lithuania, because he found out that it\u2019s\nnot good there. You know, I found out later on that I have an older sister in Lithuania.\nThis 1s how he found out that I am in that camp, from her. Somehow she found out from\nsomebody that I am alive in that camp. Maybe somebody that escaped. And she let my\nfather know it. People smuggled in things. So he know what was going on. The people\nare trying to go out of Lithuania. So anybody that went through that wanted to go back to\nKovno, to Lithuania, he wouldn\u2019t let them. He kept them there, he kept them till the\nkibbutz took them, and took them over to Bratislava, and then to displaced camps.\nBecause at that time Lodz wasn\u2019t yet Communistic as much, and --",
        "Q: Actually, maybe we should --",
        "A: Can we stop --",
        "Q: -- take a little break --",
        "A: -- at the end there?",
        "Q: -- because this 1s the -- yeah, let me just -- I made my [indecipherable]",
        "A: Ihave to go to the bathroom.",
        "Q: Yeah. This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Marsha Loen.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Marsha Loen. This is tape number one, side B. So you were in Lodz.",
        "A: So [arrived in Lodz, and my father, and everybody, we were partying, and of course I\nwas smoking, like I said, and my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t smoke,\u201d and I said, \u201cYes I can.\u201d\nAnd anyway, he did not have a big control over me, that I have to say. And it was very\nsad. And for one reason my father didn\u2019t have a big control over me, and I hate to say it,\nmy father was a very selfish man, and I remembered him from ghetto, what he did to us.\nAnd I really -- I loved my father, but I didn\u2019t like him. I\u2019m sorry to say this, should rest in\npeace. And what happened is is that in Lodz he says to me -- he -- he knew that my\nmother is dead, and he got himself a girlfriend, a friend of my mothers, that she lost her\nhusband and two kids, also in the Kovno ghetto. And what happened is is that he says to\nme, \u201cI have enough money to smuggle the border.\u2019\u2019 Now he-here he helps all the\nstrangers, and his only leftover child, he says, \u201cI have enough money to smuggle the\nborder for me and Rocholla. I don\u2019t have enough money for you.\u201d So what do I do? I\nwent into the kibbutz, in -- to work in the hospital because I know how to give a\ninjection, you know, I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp, by working with the\nanimals, it\u2019s not that different to give a injection, and take a temperature, and so on. So I\nwent into the kibbutz, and I stayed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in Lodz -- and I\nworked in the hospital, and in Madrid the head of the kibbutz came to me, and he says,\n\u201cMarsha,\u201d -- now, nobody knew my age. I -- I looked so much older than I am, thanks\nGod, that why I was alive -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s thanks God or not. And he says to me,\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d he says, \u201cyou want to go -- get over on the other side?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, I\nwant to get away from L\u00e9dz,\u201d because I was engaged to a man that was 34 years old, and\nI was not -- I was 15. He gave a diamond watch to a friend of my fathers, to introduce us.\nAnd he was so jealous when I went away on business or something in Lodz, and when he\ncame back and I wasn\u2019t home, he was running all over, looking for me. And I had already\nmy wedding dress, because he impressed me so tremendously. You know, coming out of\nthe concentration camps, coming out of that place, that Russian camp, and everything,\nand he brought me presents, and -- and he took me to places, but I could not speak\nJewish, and I could not speak any other language with him. So he said, \u201cI will do the\nspeaking, you keep quiet, Marouska.\u201d And that -- that was it. So he impressed me with all\nthe diamonds, and all the sweaters, and -- and he was a very, very rich man.",
        "Q: What nationality was he again?",
        "A: He was a Jewish -- a Polish Jew.",
        "Q: And what language did he want to speak with you?",
        "A: He want to spea -- he couldn\u2019t speak, because the Akar are killing people in Lodz, in\nthe bus stops, everywhere you went. Not many people could go to a movie in 1940s --\nend of 1945, beginning of 1946. They couldn\u2019t go to a movie. They couldn\u2019t walk the\nstreets and speak Yiddish. Absolutely not, Jewish. So what happened is is he impressed\nme with all those things, and I was going to marry him. Then -- and then I realized it, oh\nmy gosh, I can\u2019t marry that man, that man 1s -- could -- is older -- practically as old as my\nfather, he is jealous, I don\u2019t have no friends, I can\u2019t make any friends. Now this is me\nthinking, a youngster, a teenager. And I said, \u201cI have to get away from him.\u201d So on our\nengagement party at this cousin\u2019s estate in Lodz, I dance with his best friend, a Jew from\nthe Polish army, and I came back to the couch, and he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. So I\nsaid to the friend, \u201cChaim, give me my cape.\u201d And I took my cape, and I went to my\nfather\u2019s house. And I said, \u201cWould you like to go to Bratislav right now,\u201d the next\nmorning? And he was running after me, and he was yelling, and stop, and he came to the\ndoor, and that friend of his left, and I locked the door. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cPack.\u201d And\nI run over -- from the other side, I run over to the kibbutz, and I told that man, I\u2019m taking\n-- that was the next day that that was -- he wanted me to take the transport. Everything --\nyou see, we were trained to take the transport over the border, people that wanted to do it.\nAnd that what -- why I went into the kibbutz. He said to me -- I said to him, \u201cT\u2019ll take that\ntransport. But my father and my stepmother go,\u201d -- I -- I mi -- I called her my stepmother,\nshe wasn\u2019t yet -- \u201cgoes with me.\u201d He says, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s arranged.\u201d Because it so happened\nthat the people that were supposed to take me -- it, the couple don\u2019t feel so hot.",
        "Q: The idea was to go to Palestine eventually?",
        "A: Yeah. The ide -- I don\u2019t know. We had to get out of Lodz. Oh, yes, the idea to go to\nPalestine was from the beginning. To go to Palestine, that was my ideal thing. So here we\nare, we\u2019re ready, and everybody, I\u2019m taking 25 people over the border to Bratislav. From\nLodz to Bratislav, the Akar shooting after us. Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother\nRocholla, was with me in the same camp, and I helped her stay behind, because she froze\nher feet up. My feet were frozen, too. They took off her fingers from one foot, in Lodz,\nand she couldn\u2019t walk that fast. They wanted to take some of my toes off, and I wouldn\u2019t\nlet them, because the doctor said there\u2019s a chance that they can heal that. So I went for\ntherapy, and what I did 1s, I washed floors, I did everything to pay the doctor. And the\ndoctor gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it\nlooked like I had a fungus on my foot, but it start healing. And I could walk. And then\nwhen I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz paid part of it. So, in about two and a half\nmonths, my feet were ready to go. And I had those -- they got me orthopedic shoes at the\nkibbutz, and I went. And as we were going, what I wanted to tell you, I run away from\nthat guy -- later on I heard he had a nervous breakdown, I don\u2019t know about that one. But\nI want to tell you the Akar, you couldn\u2019t go to a movie, you couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant if\nyou were Jewish, if you spoke Jewish. They a -- every day they had something happen\nJew in L\u00e9dz. One was shot in a -- in a bus stop, the other one was deesent, it was terrible.\nFor me, it was a terrible thing, because as bad as the Russian was, they never beat us,\nthey never hurt us, they never shot us. So I went and I took that transport. And the Akar\nwas shooting after us. It was in the middle of the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed\ndown, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother. It didn\u2019t take long we arrived\nin Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him,\nand everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so\nhappened that we went through Austria with the train. And they said, \u201cWho would like to\nstay in Austria?\u201d And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that beautiful scenery, and\nlike I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved\nsports. Even as a child, when I was eight years old, I was at the school Olympics, you\nknow. So what happened is is that I was a daredevil. I was a -- like I\u2019m a tomboy when I\nwas a youngster. Because there was a certain branch out from my wer -- my grandfather\nfrom my mother\u2019s side was a very well-to-do man, and I was his angel. It\u2019s supposed to\nbe a boy, but still he called me by a boyish name, Yankela. But I was his life. So what I\nmean is that I -- I -- from the beginning, you know, I wasn\u2019t in public school, I was\nthrown out when I was seven years old. I hit a teacher, accidentally, you know. Not\naccidentally, sh -- a man was putting ink in the back of my head, a boy. And I told her,\nand she said -- and she didn\u2019t like it, because she knows I come from a better family. So\nshe, \u201cYou keep quiet. You sit down.\u201d And it happened four times, I couldn\u2019t stand it any\nmore. And you know the way they sit in Europe, you\u2019re a German, you know. The\nteacher sits in front before you go out the door. So I took my thing that I was writing in,\nmy book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, \u201cI am\nleaving.\u201d And accidentally I hit her nose. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story, I\u2019m not going to\nget into it. I was thrown out of the school, and my grandfather had to pay a lot of money.\nHe would have loved me to go to Hebrew school, but they -- they wouldn\u2019t take me in, so\nI went to komairts gimnasia, it was a Jewish private school. So I\u2019m telling you, I was a\ndaredevil from the beginning. So as we come to that beautiful country Austria, I said,\n\u201cPapa, if you and Rocholla want to go on to Germany, go ahead. I\u2019m staying 1n this\ncountry in. Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up, and\nfrom there we\u2019ll be able to go to Palestine, and so on.",
        "Q: Who were -- who were they? I just wondered.",
        "A: That was also the Bricha. But at that time I didn\u2019t know who they were. You\nunderstand what I mean? So I sat on the train, they stopped the train, we went off, and we\nwent toward this place called Verkshide [indecipherable]. It was a horrible place. It was\nwooden barracks. The food was also rationed, but it was good. We were DDT\u2019s, and so\non. So again, I said, why should I take that. So I made friends with the American essing\nofficer that distribute the food, and he had the -- the trucks and so on. I made friends with\nDr. Dimetritus, because I helped him in -- that he was a Greek -- not Jewish, Greek that\nrun the -- the -- the hospital in the displaced camp, and also the head of the displaced\ncamp. So -- and I also worked for the -- for the Itterdude. That\u2019s organization from --\nfrom the first president of -- of Palestine, and -- in the young brigade, goldonia. And I --\nin the displaced camp, in Verkshide, I made friends with them, so oh -- and I was getting\nlooking very good. I was a pretty good looking girl.",
        "Q: Still are.",
        "A: And I had very good friends, and I -- that essing officer, and everybody, they were just\ndoing everything when I ask, and so on. And there were a lot of ma -- people sent to the\ndisplaced camp from Israel, they were called Sheliaks, to talk to the people how to get\nover to Palestine, and at that time. And I met with them, and I went out with them one\nnight to a night club, that a friend of mine\u2019s mother owned it, Alonstra, it\u2019s in Linz, in\nAustria. And I get a call from the pharmacist, from the -- from the displaced camp. He\nsays, \u201cMarsha, we are going to DDT the camp.\u201d Verkshide. He said, \u201cWould you like to\nhave some fun?\u201d This is how I met my husband, I want to tell you this sto -- that\u2019s why\nI\u2019m telling you this story. I said, \u201cI love to, as long as you don\u2019t touch my barrack, or my\nfather\u2019s.\u201d Said fine. So I came, and they put me in in a white, big, long thing with a mask.\nAnd I am going around, and I am spraying the barracks, and being very gentle about it,\nbecause it\u2019s my people, and everything, and all of a sudden I open a room, and the people\nare sitting, they are all dressed beautiful, drinking wine, having beautiful food and\neverything. And I got so mad that I pulled my mask down, and I start spraying the DDT\nat them. And one of them was my husband, Cornelius. And at that time he saw my eyes,\nhe saw my face, and he said he fall in love with me. He was em -- then they liquidated\nVerkshide, and they send us to a much better displaced camp called Bindermichl. And\nthat was -- Goering\u2019s built some apartment houses. So they put two, three families into\nrooms, a family into a room, and with my father -- I live with my father, I got mad at my\nfather, I walked out on him. I went to live with a girlfriend, it so happened in the same\nplace my husband had a room with another man, and my husband worked for the Joint at\nthat time. Joint Distribution Committee. And I met him, and what happened is I worked\nfor the bri -- for the Itterdude, and I start getting into the Bricha business.",
        "Q: What did you do, when you say you worked for them, what did you do exactly?",
        "A: I -- I wrote for them, I translated for them in Russian, in Yiddish, in whatever it 1s. I\nworked on the Jewish typewriter, and -- you know, in -- in the same time when we moved\nto Bindermichl, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to school.\u201d To go to school -- I spoke a little bit\nof German, and to go to school you had to be a certain age, but I wanted to -- I want to go\ninto art school. Just go all over, all those things we\u2019re speaking, German, nothing, for me\nthat doesn\u2019t exist. I want to go to art school. To go to art school I had to take a course in\nGerman, and I went into art school, and also worked for the Itterdude at the same time.\nAnd one day they said to me, \u201cMarsha, we are going to take some people over.\u201d And\nwhat happened is voke -- going to -- to school in Austria, I got this Austrian outfit, with\nmy big, black braid, with the Austrian hair, you know, with the feather. And I spoke\nalready the dialect in Austria pretty good. So they said, \u201cWe need you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy do\nyou need me?\u201d They came to the office of the Itterdude. They said, \u201cWe need -- we\nsmuggle people, we\u2019re going to be straight with you. We smuggle people through the\nInnsbruck border,\u201d they say, \u201cinto the Italian, into the middle of the mountain, and there\nthe Italian take over.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready, I\u2019m going.\u201d So I -- and 1t was vacation time, and\nI come in, and they tell me what to do, and I do it. And what happened also 1s that the\nfirst thing that I went into the Austrian school to learn art, I had a friend of mine do me a\nfalse passport. A Austrian false passport, what nobody had. So I can do things that\nnobody else can. The a -- the essing officer moved with us to Bindermichl. And you\nknow to have, I mean, a friendship with that -- with the -- you must heard about it -- I\nknow you\u2019re younger than I am, to have a friendship with a -- with an American soldier,\nyou were like a whore, excuse my expression. But that man was so beautiful. And I said,\n\u201cYou know, I need a truck.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy do you need a truck?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, we want to\ngo to Ebensee skiing,\u201d we want to go there, we want to go there. He said, \u201cOkay, what\nelse do you need?\u201d I said that I need some food provision a little bit and so on. Says,\n\u201cOkay, we going out next week?\u201d I said, \u201cFine, it\u2019s alright with me.\u201d So he gave me the\ntruck, and we took the people to Zanenfeld. That\u2019s near Innsbruck, and there was nothing,\nthere was just some hou -- fenced 1n, like I remember a fenced in place. I had the picture\nof it, a trumpet. I don\u2019t know where I put it, 1t disappeared. And we would call in, and we\nwould -- we took a little package, each one took a little package with them. We went\nthrough that little -- what do you call it?",
        "Q: Little pass?",
        "A: Little pat into the mountain. We took them up the mountain, we went one by one. And\nthen we would leave them there, the Italians would take over, and the two people that\ntook them would come back to the camp, and come to Zanenfeld.",
        "Q: How dangerous was that?",
        "A: Very dangerous, because first place, I was on a false passport. Second place, I am\ncaughting smuggling people over the border. Now that was over the Italian border, you\nunderstand what I mean? They didn\u2019t know what I was smuggling there. I could say \u2019m\nsmuggling to it -- Italy, you know. And -- but it was dangerous, it was [indecipherable].\nAnd then one time was shooting off [indecipherable] it was dangerous. My father didn\u2019t\nwant me to do it, and I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do, I do what I want to do.\u201d And I\nalready met my husband.",
        "Q: How about Cornelius? Did he want to -- you to do it?",
        "A: That -- I -- he wasn\u2019t that time with me that -- that close, we just knew each other. He\ninvited me to go to a concert, and I wanted to go dancing, and I was invited from the\nAmerican head of the camp to go dancing in the club, in the camp club. And I\n[indecipherable] said, \u201cThat man is crazy. I should go to a concert when I can\u2019t go\ndancing?\u201d He said, \u201cA little culture won\u2019t help you -- won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d But I didn\u2019t go\nwith him, but every other day he was waiting near the office, the Itterdude for me. And I\nfinally start going out with him. In the beginning I was mad, it\u2019s a long story, because I\nthought he went out with somebody else, and so on.",
        "Q: What did you like about -- what did you like about him?",
        "A: What I liked about him, you see, I never went out with anybody that didn\u2019t have a\neducation. I never went out with anybody that had dirty nails, or dusty shoes. Never. That\nwas my -- I don\u2019t know why, don\u2019t ask me. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t understand it. And I\nliked him, I wasn\u2019t in love with him yet, but I liked him. And I -- and he brought me\nbeautiful things he bought from the Joint, and there was a lot of beautiful clothes, you\nknow. And I didn\u2019t really need it, because I went out with a guy -- now this 1s I wa -- I\nwas already 16. I went out with a guy that was from the Prague University, and he was\nthe head of the police in the camp, and lived out of the -- outside of the camp. And he\nthought I was going to marry him. And that -- one day he got very sick. I had a fi -- I fou\n-- another thing is, it\u2019s very interesting, this 1s old camp, and this is old displaced camp. I\nmade friends with the CIC from England, a woman, and she was very in love with that\nguy Tommy, that man that I am telling you about. And she went home one day and she\nbrought me a poodle, and for herself a big boxer. And the boxer in the compartment, in\nthe plane, bit a piece of the poodle\u2019s foot. So Dr. Dimitri, the doctor, fixed the f -- the --\nthe -- the poodle\u2019s foot. And I left him with Tommy, of course in Tommy\u2019s house, and I\ncalled him Tommy, because Tommy had some stomach trouble. He was a Jew from the\nUniversity of Prague, and I called him Tommy. So I left him, and one day, one evening I\nwent home, and I came home the next morning, and I want to go into his apartment, and\nhis valet doesn\u2019t let me in. And I said, \u201cWhy, what\u2019s going on? I have to go in, I forgot\nsomething.\u201d Anyway, I had a lit -- bitty little fight with him, I went into the room, and my\ngirls from the redhaired was sti -- the two dogs were lying next to the bed, and my\ngirlfriend\u2019s from the CIC, re -- the redhead was sticking out of the bed. He starts running\nafter me, and -- and begging me, and everything, and I said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with you.\u201d Anyway, I come to my father. He said, \u201cDo you sleep with\nhim?\u201d My father was very outspoken with me. I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, a man\nneeds it, and they need to get it somewhere. So he has your girlfriend handy, so he did it.\nI don\u2019t like Tommy, I don\u2019t want him to go out with you.\u201d I said, \u201cYou have nothing to\nsay, Papa.\u201d I said, \u201cI do what I want, but I don\u2019t want to go back with him, I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with him.\u201d So one day I was out with the shleeoch dancing, and I get again\na call. Tommy is very sick, he won\u2019t take any medicine, nothing. This was already\nBindermichl. He won\u2019t take any medicine, nothing, till you come to see him. So I said to\nhim, \u201cChaim, would you go with me?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, to save a person\u2019s life.\u201d So I went\nwith him, and he took the medicine, and he got better, and I had to promise him, I said,\n\u201cLook, my father doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d right away I used my father. I don\u2019t even live with\nhim, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want -- like you, doesn\u2019t want me to marry m -- y -- me. Why don\u2019t you go\nto Italy with the transport, and I\u2019ll meet you there afterwards?\u201d In the meanwhile, it\u2019s a\nlong story, I met Cornelius. I thought I fall in love with him, and I thought to myself --\nand he asked me to marry him. And he said, \u201cIt would be a good time. My two friends,\nmy best two friends are coming back from Italy,\u201d they left to go to buna -- San Paolo, or\nBuenos Aires, I don\u2019t know where it was. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back, could we get married?\u201d\nAnd we got ma -- we were get -- we got married, and Barbie, she should [indecipherable]\nwent back to Italy, and accidentally they met Tommy. And Tommy said, \u201cOh, you come\nfrom Bindermichl, my fianc\u00e9e is coming.\u201d And he took out that picture, and this woman\ndidn\u2019t mean that it was that it was that serious. So she says -- Barbie, she says, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, your fianc\u00e9e just married our best friend.\u201d But before that I went with the opera\nsinger from Romania. I went with the guy that went -- also from Romania, that went with\nthe King sisters. And one woman was very jealous, and she said to my father, \u201cHow can\nyou let her go out so much, with so many men?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s better too many men than\njust one. So I\u2019m sure nothing will happen.\u201d And my father didn\u2019t have anything to say\nabout who I'll go out or what I do anyway. But he liked Cornelius, I don\u2019t know why.\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know, Papa, he is half Jewish, he is not even Jewish.\u201d He says, \u201cYou\nwill make something, I know you, you\u2019ll make him Jewish. Don\u2019t -- \u2019'm not worried\nabout it.\u201d\u201d And he gave him -- I\u2019Il never forget -- my husband hates fish. And he gave\nhim, he said, \u201cWould you like a drink with a piece of herring?\u201d Of course, Cornelius was\na gentleman. You know, he was so debonair, I think that what impressed me, he wore that\nhat with the pipe, you know, he was very well dressed, I\u2019Il show you pictures. And that\nwhat impressed me so much about him. And I brought him uppa -- and we were in the\nroom eating, and the father gives him a piece of herring, was a gentleman, he start eating\nthat herring, and he chewed and he chewed, and he chewed. And I said, \u201cPapa, go out and\nhelp Rocholla in the kitchen.\u201d And we were on the second floor, and I said, \u201cCornelius,\nspit it out right away,\u201d you know. And then when I speak German, because the only\nlanguage that we can communicate, and what Cornelius did a lot for me, is that he helped\nme go to school, and then in Windham, there were the big bed, and then I was e -- and we\nwere married already, and a friend of ours was lying on the other side, and we were -- I\nwas doing my homework. I was also at the theater in Austria, and the -- in the\nkammershpeeler. But Cornelius made my father, and he made me quit it, because they\nsaw -- there was a play -- I -- I don\u2019t have very perfect legs, so I always had to wear long\nclothes. So I played the maid in the kammershpeel -- you know how beautiful the\nkammershpeeler varm, with the chandelier, and everything. I played a maid the harem\nhouse. How do you Say it? It was a -- a film made, and also a movie, segments of it in\nEnglish. The harem house, you know, with the maid, where the father says tyrin down, do\neverything, this and this and that, and he was there.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: The head of the house, I forgot what the thing was. And I played that in the\nkammershpeeler. Then Cornelius saw the leading lady walking around in a bra, from one\nroom to the other. And he said to my father, he said, \u201cBerrik, do you like that?\u201d My father\nsaid, \u201cNo, but I have no control over her, maybe you can do something.\u201d So they did\nsomething, and that was the end of my theater career -- career. Anyway, what I want to\ntell you, I went to art school, and I learned how to -- to design clothes. What can you do\nin that little time? But I had it in me from my father, that\u2019s one thing you -- he was one of\nthe best tailors. And my dress won first prize, and I\u2019ll never forget it. It was a royal blue\ndress that I designed. Was with the high neck, royal blue like a crepe suz -- a crepe\nmaterial that\u2019s silk. And it had a big Japanese pocket I put on it. I must have seen it\nsomewhere or something. And then the belt went in, right into the pocket, and it tied. And\nthen I put on the model big, red jewelry on the royal blue, with big, red earring, and\nbeautiful black marble. It won first prize. So that was it.",
        "Q: Wha --",
        "A: And when I got married -- yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: Wh-what yar -- what year are we roughly now? Is that 1946?",
        "A: We\u2019re roughly on the end of 1946, as I was going already, with Cornelius.",
        "Q: Actually, I -- I have a few follow up questions now, but I --",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- we should -- I should [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- can we -- can I go to the bathroom?",
        "Q: Yes, I just want to say my little thing. This is the end of tape one, side B, interview\nwith Marsha Loen.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: -- interview with Marsha Loen. This is tape number two, side A. Marsha, I have about\nthree questions now that I just kind of toss out before you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay. Just go ahead, Regina.",
        "Q: Question number one, it was not difficult for you to live in Austria, and speak the\nGerman language, when you had been actually in the German concentration camp?",
        "A: Absolutely not, and I\u20191l tell you why. Can I tell you why?",
        "Q: Please, yes.",
        "A: I\u2019m even driving a German car, because you cannot go on hating all your life, you\nonly hurt yourself. And that is what I learned here in school, when I took a couple of\nsemesters from psychology, after I finished high school, and junior -- college. Because --",
        "Q: But when you\u2019re --",
        "A: -- Ime -- I don\u2019t say I\u2019m in love with the people that -- that -- the offspring that the\npeople that did it to me, but I cannot also hate, because I\u2019m only going to hurt myself.\nAnd language is a culture, and the German is a very good car, because I get a very good\ntrade-in on it. So that\u2019s the answer for you, Regina.",
        "Q: But even at that time, when everything was still so close.",
        "A: It bothered me to a certain extent that I don\u2019t feel nothing. It did bother me, but I\ndidn\u2019t feel anything about it. I\u2019m sorry to say that, maybe it\u2019s wrong. But, you know, to\nhate is to hurt yourself, and that I\u2019ve learned from the beginning as I was liberated, with\nthe Russians, with everything else. If you hate, you only hurt yourself. Without even\ngoing to school, I knew about it. I felt about it, let\u2019s say, this way.",
        "Q: The other question I had was, did you ever meet a vakovna actually at that time?",
        "A: No. Not till after eight years, or seven years I was in this country. I didn\u2019t even know\nsurvivor exist for about seven years in this country. That is another story.",
        "Q: Well that we shall definitely talk about that a little later.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they we\u2019ll finish this soon.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, yeah. And -- and the last question is though, was it important for you to\nsome degree that Cornelius was also a survivor? Did you talk about where you came\nfrom, or was that not that --",
        "A: Shall I tell you something? First place, Cornelius was a different survivor that I was.\nHe had a Christian mother that was a Righteous Christian that impressed me\ntremendously. She saved 32 Jews. In fact, she has right now a tree in Jerusalem. And\nshe\u2019s in one of our guides in the museum as a Righteous Christian, in the same guide that\nSchindler is, and Wallenberg. Second place, he was a gentleman. Third place, he came\nfrom Yugoslavia, where the lot of his family was killed, too, in Novosad. And third place,\nhe was a good looking man, he was well dressed, and he was clean. And that was the\nmost important thing to me. I don\u2019t care if he would have been -- I don\u2019t know what. And\nthe language that we spoke and could understand each other was only German, because\nhe doesn\u2019t speak Yiddish -- Jewish. I didn\u2019t speak Hungarian, or Yugoslavian, or any\nother language, or English. He spoke 12 languages, I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t that bright. I was\nbright, but not that bright. So, it didn\u2019t bother me at all.",
        "Q: So what were -- what were your plans eventually, then? You did not intend to stay in\nAustria?",
        "A: Definitely not. Before I met Cornelius, I was the biggest Zionist that ever existed.\nSmuggling the people over the border to Palestine. In fact, Ben-Gurion\u2019s what was his\nname, Shorette was at my wedding, and I was crying, because I had to go to America,\nbecause Cornelius\u2019 family was here. And he said, \u201cMarsha, we need people like you in\nAmerica, too. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d So it was a sadness to a certain extent, a sadness in me that I\ncouldn\u2019t go to Palestine. But another thing I went to a country that I thought I would\nnever got -- get to. You understand what I -- in a way it was selfish, but I was happy.",
        "Q: We'll talk a little bit more about that when we -- when we get there. So how did you\nget there, actually? What -- what happened?",
        "A: What happened? How did I get to America?",
        "Q: To America, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. I married Cornelius, Cornelius had a brother here that came in 1939 for the\nWorld Fair, on his honeymoon. Lost all our money. In fact, when I married Cornelius he\nwas very rich, because I also went for rich people, because I didn\u2019t want to have no food\nagain. And then we got a letter that in 1947, when we got married, his mother and father\nwere supposed to go through Vienna. And I had a false passport, and he had a passport,\nand we were supposed to meet them in Vienna, and then the thing was changed, and they\nwent through Prague, they went by plane. They shipped a lot of antiques, that my father-\nin-law was going to open an antique shop. I don\u2019t want to go into a big story about it,\neverything was stolen, and we couldn\u2019t rip -- we were making 30 dollars a week, and paid\na private detective all over. Nothing was found except a couple of paintings that were\nbetween the bedding that came in those empty cases. So this is the first time I lost money,\nand I didn\u2019t feel sorry for me. I felt sorry for my mother-in-law, and father-in-law that\nhad an estate with maids and chauffer, and two cars in Europe, you know what it means.\nA Fiat, and a Chevrolet for the boys. And ift -- went to San Marco when David -- when\nConnor was three years old, and all over Switzerland, and Cornelius went to -- to college\nin Budapest, and to Switzerland, and -- very, very rich people. And she had to come and\nstart crocheting, and start work. I felt rather sorry for them than for myself.",
        "Q: So how did you -- how did you get over then, by boat?",
        "A: So we came, and we went from Bindermichl, we went to Bremerhaven, and there\u2019s\ndecided there is a boat going through New Orleans, if you -- and it would take 14 days\nrather than more. And we went on that boat. Then that was after -- we were married in\n47, that was in August 1949. And we went on the boat, and being that Cornelius spoke\nso many languages, he was invited as a interpreter to speak over the tape recorder, and we\ncame on the boat early. Came in on the boat early, I was made shtudmarder -- the head of\nthat old woman, barra -- because the women and the men slept separate. And I met the\ntwo Ire officers. And like I said, I was pretty good looking, had a good sense of humor,\nknew how to dance, I won a couple of contested. And that rock and roll in Austria. Not\nwith Cornelius, he\u2019s a lousy dancer, with his friend. And being in the theater, you know,\nand everything. And I made very good friends with the Ire officer. And I got very sick\ngoing through the channel, very sick. And, you know, being that Cornelius was with the\nJoint, and part director of the Joint Distribution Committee, I got an apartment in the\ndisplaced camp that they had a telephone. And through that I met a lot of black\nmarketeers. Ve -- he never did it, because he was afraid, God forbid, he couldn\u2019t go to\nAmerica. So even when he lost all his money, he wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, did\nmy tuxedo arrive? She s -- she wrote him back, \u201cCornelius, with all the money that you\nhave now, you don\u2019t need a tuxedo.\u201d The first thing didn\u2019t bother him, the money, or the\ndiamonds, or everything else, it bothered him is the tuxedo. So what happened 1s is that\nwhen we lived there, and we had that telephone, a lot of black marketeers would come\nover and make telephone calls, and everything else. And they went to England, and they\nbrought me beautiful clothes, you know, as [indecipherable]. But I had a maid from\nDabotchka, Maria, I\u2019ll never forget. And they would come in, and if I wasn\u2019t at home,\nand they would go into the kitchen in the displaced camp, I had a beautiful apartment --\nWiesenthal, from the -- from the Museum of Tolerance, lived above me. I gave him a\nparty line, and I gave him a maid. And I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with that man if he\nsaid boo.",
        "Q: How come\u2019?",
        "A: Because he\u2019s the biggest phony in the world. I\u2019m sorry to say that on tape. Anyway --\nand if you want to cut it out, you\u2019re welcome to it.",
        "Q: No, actually, I would like to ask you more about that.",
        "A: Anyway, and the thing is 1s that that will come later, with the museum. And the thing\nis is that I had a telephone, I had all those clothes, we were on the boat, and I didn\u2019t know\nwhere Connor is, Cornelius didn\u2019t know where I -- all of a sudden I didn\u2019t know if I was\nin love with him, if I was not in love with him. And I start throwing up. And that Ire\nofficer was already a little bit in love with me, I had a feeling. So he came down to the\nthing, and he picked me up -- at that time I was only a size seven. I wasn\u2019t what I was\nright n -- he picked me up, in that pink robe [indecipherable] and he gave me his cabin,\nand he went to live with the other Ire officer. And my husband, when I saw him on the\ndeck, I got -- I got well after I saw him. And my husband stayed with me in that -- in that\ncabin, and everybody, all of those survivors that were on that boat, thought that I had an\naffair with the tyrit officer. At my age, just married, you know, and everything else. But I\nlet them talk. And my husband was with me, and we had that cabin over, and we were 14\ndays on the sea. And I got better, and I went out to mingle with the people, and I arranged\na dance on the boat. And, you know, 14 days over the Mississippi, in order to go to New\nOrleans, was a long time. And varabul Connor start feeling better, I start feeling better. I\nhad nice clothes, and I had that friend, that Ire officer. In fact, he came to Los Angeles\none time, when I was very unhappy, because he left me a PO box, in case I\u2019m not happy,\nto send him a letter. And I was unhappy because in the beginning we lived with our 1n-\nlaws, and so on. So I was a little unhappy, till I got that letter, and he came over, and he\nsaid, \u201cAll you do, move out or I take Marsha with me.\u201d",
        "Q: So you had a protector there. A friend, friend.",
        "A: Yeah, t -- I had a protector, and a friend. And he -- he di -- he was in love with me,\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know. But I did not have an affair with him. I\u2019m telling you, on tape, or on\nthe tape, or off a tape. But everybody thought I did. And we went 14 days\n[indecipherable]. And we arrived to New Orleans, and of course, if we arrived in New\nOrleans -- Cornelius was still the gentleman, and he still knew a little more like all\ndisplaced people, because he was -- and he beat the champion in Ping Pong.",
        "Q: On the boat, or in the --",
        "A: No, in New Orleans.",
        "Q: In New Orleans.",
        "A: In New Orleans. We were in the Jewish -- the Jewish geminda vizakmindas in -- 1n --\nin -- in --",
        "Q: Nay -- neighborhood [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, the gemine, the Jewish farbaltung. The -- the Jews that took care of the people.\nWe were the first boat to arrive in New Orleans. I was so stupid, I took my pearls, and\nrings, and things, and I was afraid to take it with me at the displaced camp, send it with --\nsomebody smuggled -- brought it to my -- to my mother-in-law before 1947, before they\nleft, and -- and theirs were -- everything was stolen, including my things. When I came\ninto New Orleans, they didn\u2019t even look at it, they were so happy to see us, the first boat,\nyou know. And we were staying with all the Jews, it was like a temple, you know, like\nthe Jewish Federation here. You know, there was arranged a -- a big room with food, and\nthe bananas and everything. Because on the boat all I got -- I was invited once to the\ncaptain\u2019s table, and they ask me what would I like. I said, \u201cI would like a piece of black\nbread. I can\u2019t stand that cotton any more.\u201d And then they gave me a bowl of cottage\ncheese and fruit, and I said, \u201cWould you do me a favor, would you separate the fruit and\nthe cottage cheese?\u201d You know, with me there was no nothing, captain or no captain, if I\nhad to say something, I said it. And I start helping the people on the boat. You know,\nthere was a little boy -- she died, and he\u2019s sick, and now he\u2019s a very famous pharmacist,\nand he\u2019s very well to -- I haven\u2019t seen him for maybe 20 years. His name was Leon\nLolinka was his name, and he -- his father was from my town, and I knew his mother.\nAnd I brought food for him, I had food brought for him, and juices that was brought to\nmy cabin and everything. And we arrived in New Orleans like I said, and we were in that\ngeminda. My husband right away played Ping Pong, you know, his life, cause that what\nthey did also in the displaced camp with his cousin, played chess, played Ping Pong. He\nbeat the champion, and a Jewish woman that was -- owned a couple of apartment houses,\nwas very impressed with us, the way we were dressed, than the other people, and my\nhusband beating the champion and every -- she invited .us for dinner, and as we were\nwalking, I had my camera, and I stopped, and I wanted to take a picture of a little black\ngirl in a yellow dress. She was the most gorgeous, beautiful African-American I\u2019ve ever -\n- African-Americ -- at that time we called them black -- African-American girl I\u2019ve ever\nseen, and she came to me, and she said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do those things here.\u201d I said, \u201cI just\nfinished being in a concentration camp, in a displaced camp, in a Russian camp, and\nyou\u2019re coming to tell me that I cannot take a picture of that woman because she has a\ndifferent color skin? Forget your dinner, I\u2019m not coming, invite somebody else.\u201d And I\nwalked away from her. And that rich woman, that I could have had a lot out of her,\nbelieve me, but I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her. Absolutely nothing. She\napologized, and she said, \u201cThis is the rules,\u201d you know, \u201cand I\u2019m Jewish too.\u201d You know,\nand I said, \u201cNo, to me you are not Jewish, because if you would have been Jewish you\nwould have done something about me, and about my two little sisters, and you wouldn\u2019t\nlet me -- tell me that I can\u2019t take a picture of that woman. It was the end of it.",
        "Q: Was anybody interested where you were coming from, so to speak, in --",
        "A: Oh, in New Orleans they were -- not that interested, they were just trying to be nice to\nus. Interested nobody was. Nobody wanted to hear the sad stories, and at that time I really\nwasn\u2019t read to tell them yet, to tell you the honest truth, as I arrived. And the -- like I said,\nwe arrived, and I to -- my mother lived in a -- mother-in-law lived in a big house, she was\nliving in a shack. It was a better neighborhood than Bull Heights, and she was working\nalready. And, you know, there was no money. My brother-in-law was broke. My father-\nin-law send him money for the boys, and when everybody went into airplanes, he we --\nhe went into lawnmowers. They didn\u2019t take him in the army because he had something\nwith his eyes, and he lost that money, and his money, and his wife\u2019s money, and\neverybody else, and we were completely broke.",
        "Q: And that was already in Los Angeles, or that was [indecipherable]",
        "A: In Los Angel -- everything that -- no, in New Orleans we were there a couple of days,\nand then we took a train direct to Los Angeles. And the 70 dollars that he laid out for us, I\npaid him back, because I didn\u2019t want nothing from nobody. And we live with my mother-\nin-law and father-in-law like I said, and they -- Connor was the youngest one, and I start\nworking in a factory. We had to live, we had to eat. I start work in a factory, and what\nhappened is is the foreman wan -- was on vacation -- like I say, I was very handy going --\nworking already on clothes, and everything. And the man that owned the place, his name\nwas Rubin, I will also never forget, he came and he said to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give out\nthe work? Why don\u2019t you act as the foreman?\u201d Worked there couple of days, and every\nnight I came home I was throwing up, and Connor couldn\u2019t get a job. So we went to the\nJewish Federation, that I work now for, at that time, because we came with the affidavit,\nso we got nothing from HIAS, nothing from nobody. So we had to do it -- everything\nourself. So we went there, and they gave him a job as a -- a watchman in a motel -- the\n[indecipherable] the motel is still standing. That man didn\u2019t ever know what a gun means,\nor anything at all the gun. And then my father-in-law would bring the papers and read it\nfor me, because I wasn\u2019t that good in English that time, how many people were killed in\nmotels, with guns, with that. And then I didn\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m sick, so I would\nthrow up at night, because I couldn\u2019t take the sweat, the smell of the factory. Not that I\nwas a snob, I just couldn\u2019t take it. And then Cornelius got another job with a friend, in --\nwith German lenses, through his brother. Not very much paid, and I -- my mother-in-law\ngot me a job with a designer, Suzy. Suzy with a designer, designed sweaters, and skirts\nwith felt appliqu\u00e9ds, it was very much in fashion. Sold it to Saks, and everything -- and\nwe had a store on the strip. And where we lived 1s, we lived near the strip. It was between\nthe strip and Santa Monica, and at that time the strip was the place. There was the -- the\nmola -- th-the LaRue, there was the Mocambo, Ciro, everything was there. And that was\nthe place there, a main shop, and the factory downstairs, and I worked there. She was\nvery good to me, very good to me, because I caught on just like that, one, two, three. And\nshe would come down, and she would say, \u201cWhat do you think, what should we design?\u201d\nAnd she lived above, in the better area, over Sunset, at that time, on Clark Street. It -- it\u2019s\nsounded center now, where the Billage Hotel 1s, but 1t was at Clark Street at that time.\nAnd we moved out from my mother-in-law\u2019s, and everything they spend on us, we wrote\nit down, and the minute we made 200 dollars, we paid them all back. But what we did is -\n- my teeth were all broken from the calcium I didn\u2019t have, and they worked on it in\nAustria, and they ruined it even more. So I went into a dentist that was down the street,\non Santa Monica and Clark Street, someone sent me. There was a Thrifty drugstore, and\nhis office was upstairs. And I made very good fr -- I made very easy friend, I made very\ngood friends with him. He start working on me, gave me a good price. I didn\u2019t want it for\nnothing, and I paid him off slowly. And we got to be the best of friend. This were our\nfirst friend in America, the Vestliss. And what happened is is my father-in-law went in\nthe basement in the May Company right there, and bought me a black dress, we were\ngoing out, so what I did is, I had a colorful scarf -- because the clothes that I brought\nfrom Europe, I couldn\u2019t wear, with those big pads. Connor\u2019s shoes were squeak --\nsqueaking, you know. It was complete different life, a complete different scene. And\nthese were people that already had catalogs, and -- and -- and live -- lived in Beverly\nWood, in Beverly Hills, in the valley, and so on. And eve -- they got to be very good\nfriends of mine. And I was working at Suzy\u2019s, and Suzy went to Paris. And her husband,\nthat was a very good looking man went after me, and I had to quit. And I didn\u2019t worry,\nbecause I had a job waiting for me at Sidney\u2019s. And Sidney on LaSeneca was also one of\nthe most exclusive -- and all I needed, clothes. Now, when I was at Suzy\u2019s, I went -- I\nmet Marlena Dietrich, I met all the movie stars. Marlena Dietrich, I called her a whore,\nbecause she -- I didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t afraid of her, because she didn\u2019t pay her bills anyways\n[indecipherable] I -- I -- I said -- I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s the different is in English between\nMadame and Madame at that time. So Suzy was downstairs, and she said, \u201cI would like\nSuzy to fit me.\u201d I was upstairs. I said, \u201cSuzy, the Madame is here.\u201d She said, \u201cIn America\nwe say Madame.\u201d Say -- and I knew that she understood German, and Suzy was from\nAustria, her father was a Austrian actor, so I, \u201cSuzy, the hura is here.\u201d The whore is here,\nin German.",
        "Q: My God.",
        "A: And, you know, I wasn\u2019t afraid of the devil, you know. But Suzy, they -- in fact, I had\na [indecipherable] too, because the -- she had a publicity lady there at that time, she paid\n200 dollars a month, was a lot of money in the 1950 -- 19 fift -- 1949 - 1950. And she\nsaid, you know -- the publicity lady came in, she took some picture and everything else,\nand she put in a magazine me and Suzy, and cutting out a poodle. And Suzy had a poodle\nnamed Lulu. It said, \u201cSuzy and partner working on a Lulu creation.\u201d Do you know that\nwoman didn\u2019t come in for two weeks 1 -- to the st -- to the -- to the factory? I had to run\nthe factory, because she did not like it that I was with her in the magazine, the public --\nbut it wasn\u2019t my fault, in fact, that actress, Barbara Britten was modeling for us at that\nmagazine at that time. It wasn\u2019t my fault, I didn\u2019t even want to sit there. Who cared if I\u2019m\nin a magazine or not? All I was worrying, where is the next bread coming from? Where\nam I going to pay the detective to look for our stuff, and so on, you know. But at night --\nshe didn\u2019t live very far, and she would have an idea, she was very creative. She would\nhave an idea -- in fact, she was engaged to Groucho Marx at one time. And she would\nhave an idea, and she would say -- she married that guy, Larry. Why don\u2019t you come\nover, Pasternak is here with his wife around the pool and everything, and we can work on\nthe -- on the creation, I have something in my -- so we would work for hours. She never\npaid me overtime, but she always was very good to me, and she bought me certain things\nthat I didn\u2019t have, and so on.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: But I forgot to tell you, when we moved into that little apartment, over the garage, a\nrent control apartment, Al and Juliet West, who went and signed for me at Sears and\nRoebuck, so we get it on payments, and we bought our bedroom -- we Lysoled it, and we\npainted it. And at that time, 1t was not modern, wooden floors, but it was wooden floors,\nwe shined it. And we had red couches with pink troracks. And we didn\u2019t have a dining,\nwe just had a dining area. And all my friends that lived in Beverly Hills, and everywhere\nelse, they liked to come to -- to my house to eat, because I learned how to cook from my\nmother-in-law. She wa -- she went to Budapest to study cooking business, to teach the\ncooks how to cook. So I got to be a very good cook, so everybody liked to come to my\nhouse. I met a lot of interesting people, very interesting people, because I met the Essex,\nthey should rest in peace, they were all older than I was. He was writing the Mickey\nSpillane movies. I met other people, doctors -- in fact, he had a -- this was the funniest\nthing because I wasn\u2019t used to it. At one time we lived in Beverly Wood at that time, on\nSawyer Street, was a very -- it\u2019s still a very expensive street. And he gave a Halloween\nparty, and I went as Auntie Mame, and he went as my follower. And I -- I took a bracelet,\nand I had jewelry, and I made myself a very fancy thing, with my hair up, you know. And\nI come into his house, and on the drapes were hanging a big -- I hate to say it on the cam\n-- on tape -- a big skeleton with a wiener hanging out. But they all came in diapers. The\ndoctors, the lawyers, those intelligent peop -- they came in diapers. One came as Adam\nand Eve, with fig leafs. And here I was worried, you know, this going on. And then I had\nanother problem with them, because a lot of those intellectuals were on the pink side. Not\nred, but on the pink side, because their background was their parents run away from the\nBolsheviks. You know, from the czar, Bolshevik, whatever it is. So one time they took\nme to a theater, and we saw a show, and it was a union tee -- I don\u2019t know what it was.\nAnd somebody was talking against America. And I s -- got up and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I\nstart walking out the theater. And four of them went after me, my friends, that is --\nnothing should happen to me, that the people shouldn\u2019t kill me. They didn\u2019t tell me where\nthey were taking me. But I had a wonderful time, they are still wonderful people, they\u2019re\nvery old, very old, but wonderful people. And Juliet and Al, Elizabeth and Rolfe are my\nvery closest friend. Elizabeth and Rolfe, they had a big drugstore on the corner of Fairfax,\na old drugstore. And Juliet and Al, Juliet -- when I had my baby, David, I wasn\u2019t allowed\nto have children, because in the concentration camp, you must have heard on the tape,\nthey did something to me by looking for gold. And I tricked my husband into having\nDavid. When I had David, and I couldn\u2019t afford, and I couldn\u2019t get a nurse, it was my\nfirst house, I had a little small house in the valley, where I opened already my own\nbusiness, that Al -- with the help from Al, that wrote me a blank check, if I need money,\nthat he got back every penny, plus. And eliz -- help with Elizabeth and Rolfe. All\nAmerican friends, I didn\u2019t know that -- that -- that survivors exist, only that person that I\ncame on the boat, I told you, with the little boy. I came to visit him in Bull Heights.\nCornelius bought a -- a old car, and we drove there every two weeks to visit him, he\nnever told me survivor existed, because he thought they weren\u2019t good enough for\nCornelius. That was so stupid. Anyway, so what happened 1s is I did this -- where was I?\nIn the middle of telling you the story.",
        "Q: You talked about David [indecipherable]",
        "A: About David. When David was born, she gave me a maid, Myrtle, that brought up her\nchildren, for months. For months, because I had the studio already, that I didn\u2019t tell you,\nin Sherman Oaks, to work for me. This is what kind of a friends she was.",
        "Q: Maybe this is a good time to --",
        "A: Rest?",
        "Q: -- to stop this one.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape two, side A, interview with Marsha Loen.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMarsha Loen. This 1s type -- this is tape number two, side B. I would like to ask you a\nquestion about your son, David. First of all, when was he born, and --",
        "A: Regina, can I interrupt you? Why don\u2019t you let me tell you before David, when I went\nto school, and I started working on the museum?",
        "Q: Okay, go right ahead.",
        "A: And then [Il tell you how we bought the -- okay.",
        "Q: Okay, fine.",
        "A: I went to -- I decided -- my husband\u2019s family was very educated, and I decided that\nI\u2019m not going to let them see that -- like I was born under a stone, somewhere on the\nbeach, especially my brother-in-law that was a philosopher, and very intelligent man, he\njust died about si -- three months ago, at 85. And what I did is, Cornelius went with me\nwith the streetcar from Santa Monica to Hollywood, and every night after work, I went to\nHollywood High. And then, without knowing any survivors or anything, somebody told\nme they are going to build a monument, and they are having a meeting on Vermont.\nHolocaust monument. So I went there, and Is -- the meeting, and all of a sudden, my part\nof the committee. So I prayed -- played through them from school that night when they\nhad a meeting, and I helped build that monument -- I mean the -- the museum. And in\n1978, when we opened the museum, I was chairing it, and that why I wanted to interrupt\nyou to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why am I mad at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell\nyou why. Because before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak\nfor us. I shouldn\u2019t say that on tape, but I have to get it off my chest. And maybe I'll get\nfired for it, but I don\u2019t care. Before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was\nsupposed to speak for us. Our chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a\nmeeting in his house. And I don\u2019t -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and\nsaid that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like\ncattle. And we couldn\u2019t even afford it to open the museum, how can we afford to give\nhim five dollar more to be our -- our speaker at the mu -- at the big dinner, at the opening.\nAnd then the Wiesenthal Center came to us -- that is now the Wiesenthal Center, with the\nproposition theyll give us 25,000 dollars for him. And being that we couldn\u2019t get it more\nfrom the federation, because they gave us a lot, we sold Wiesenthal for 25,000 dollars to\nthe Wiesenthal Center. The Los Angel -- at that time we were the Martyr\u2019s Memorial,\nand the Holocaust Museum, we just changed our name to the Los Angeles Museum of the\nHolocaust because it\u2019s much easier to -- to get to understand it. And that\u2019s why\nWiesenthal for me is absolutely poo, and the reas -- I have been once at the Wiesenthal\nCenter, and that was with a delegation -- this comes later -- with a delegation from --\nfrom Russia, that came to see what we did, and they saw our museum, they saw the\nWiesenthal museum. And let me tell you something, a very famous man from there, that\nhelped build the museum, behind the synagogue in Moscow said that our museum is a\nHolocaust Museum, theirs is a Disneyland Holocaust. I\u2019m sorry to say it on tape, but this\nwhat it is, and if ever anybody hears it, please forgive me, if you\u2019re interested in the\nWiesenthal Center, because it\u2019s strictly too much to do -- I\u2019m so -- corne --",
        "Q: Cornelius? We\u2019re hearing a little noise here, okay?",
        "A: And Wiesenthal is -- he should live to 120, I have nothing against him, but he made\nhimself a name. I know him because he lived upstairs, across from us -- leef -- because\nthis was the elite of the DP camp. And across from us lived a name -- a man by the name\nof Ignatz. We called him -- what -- called him, Ignatz? And he was prosecuting the\nHungarian Nazis. And then Wiesenthal took it all over.",
        "Q: That was in Linz, in Austria.",
        "A: That was in Linz, in Austria, in Bindermichl. And if he denies it, he\u2019s a liar. Anyway,\nlet\u2019s go back to -- now, we can go back to David.",
        "Q: Well -- well, let\u2019s talk about David a little later then, because --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- you just began to talk about you work with the museum.",
        "A: David was born then, already, so David was born in 1958. The doctor said I couldn\u2019t\nhave children, because first place our bloods are different, mine and Cornelius, and I was\nafraid. They say the first child it\u2019s nothing, but I was afraid. Also, when -- if you hear my\ntape in -- in the museum, they took me into a room, and they looked for gold. And I was\nvery young, and they did something there, so it was very -- the doctor didn\u2019t want -- they\ndidn\u2019t want me -- but I wanted a child, because when my father -- in 57 they brought my\nfather, that survived Dachau. I worked so hard for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital\nin Los Angeles. I and Cornelius were fundraising in the valley. So they surprised me on a\ntelevision show. It was called at that time, \u201cIt Could Be You.\u201d And they told me I was\ngoing to have -- announce my fashion show, cause I\u2019m giving for Gateway for mental\nhealth. And they came to pick me up, and then they surprised me with my father. And\nwhat happened is my father came, and he came into the -- to my house, and he says, \u201cOh,\na Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children.\u201d And it practically killed me. So -- and then my\nmother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very, very bad accident, and the two sons were\nso good, and they were so terrific, and that day I decided -- and I knew my mother was --\njust has to snap a finger, she had a baby. I remember this as a child, and in ghetto, she wa\n-- a ba -- baby was born. She was made before the ghetto, was born in ghetto. And I said\nto myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to get pregnant, I\u2019m gong to trick him into it.\u201d And I got pregnant.\nAnd being that I am a designer, I wore a certain kind of clothes, that he never noticed it\ntill about the third or fourth month, and then I told him. And I wouldn\u2019t go to a\ngynecologist, but again, one of my model\u2019s husband\u2019s was a very famous gynecologist.\nHe also charged me a big amount, because he thought I was so filthy rich, because of my\nstudio, and his wife models for me. And I went to him, and I was pregnant, and all\nthrough the pregnancy we -- we did out garden in our home -- in our new home, and we\ndid -- the front we added landscape, I -- landscaper. I was bleeding, and I never told the\ndoctor, and I never told -- and David was born prematured. And I had the dachshund at\nthat time that was sick. And -- and I had my little house on Bervis in Van Nuys. And I\nopened in \u201953 ti -- my studio, ameet studio in Sherman Oaks. And when I opened the\nstudio is my friend the Vestliss\u2019, they helped me, and who went looking with me,\nElizabeth, because they had a big drugstore in the valley, and we found that place, and it\nwas -- and I remodeled it in a early American, because I loved the early American,\nbecause that for me presented the country that I came, and that gave me a home. And\neven in my house, in my first house, I had the early American. In my little apartment\nbehind the studio, I had the early American with the hooked rug. And now I go a little\nmore modern. I got used to America. Anyway, and what happened 1s is that I -- I -- I got\npregnant, and I worked, and like I said, I brought my father out, and it upset me, and then\nwhen my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I\u2019m gone there wa -- nobody\ngoing to be left, I have to have something. And I stuck it out, and David was born in the\neighth month. And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that\ntime they just build the Encino hospital, and it wasn\u2019t far from my -- from my studio. So\nwhat happened is 1s I got -- and it was Monday morning, I got terrible cramps, and I\ncalled a friend if she could take me. And she took me in, and the doctor said take her in\nright away, because I had -- delivering another baby. And she was sitting in the front\nroom, and doing a -- she told -- I found out later doing a check, balancing your\ncheckbook. That was all still Americans, not -- no survivors. I didn\u2019t know any survivors.\nAnd the -- they came out and they said, \u201cWhere can we get hold of Mr. Loen?\u201d And\nCornelius\u2019 office always on the ru -- on the road. And th -- she said -- th -- she says,\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Said, \u201cMrs. Loen is being admitted.\u201d So I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a baby,\u201d and\nall the checks were flying all over the waiting room. My friend, the schultz. Anyway, so\nwhat happened is David was born, and he was in a incubator. And I had one stitch. One\nstitch, because I was pretty flexible. And then Fritz was sick, and he was in a -- in\nTarzana in a hospital. So, I had the people working for me in the studio.",
        "Q: Who was Fritz?",
        "A: Fritz was my little dachshund. And -- I took him out from a pound, believe it or not. I\ngave him a home. And he was a pedigree. And he had -- his b-behind legs was hurt -- was\nvery bad, so I took him to the finest hospitals in Tarzana, very far away. So I would go\nand visit my baby in the incubator, then visit Fritz, and then come back to work in the\nstudio.",
        "Q: Id like to ask you just two quick questions for clarification.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It would have been dangerous for you to get a child? That was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. I -- 1t told me -- when the doctor was putting me in the hospital -- what was his\nname, Cornell? I forgot, oh.",
        "Q: That\u2019s alright.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s -- we were -- we were so close. He was putting me in the hospital, he says,\n\u201cFirst I\u2019m going to save your life, and then I\u2019m going to save the baby\u2019s.\u201d I said,\n\u201cRobert,\u201d rob -- I said, \u201cRobert, if my baby dies, I kill you. I went through eight months,\nand I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d So you see, because I\u2019ve done so much in the concentration\ncamps, and afterwards, with charity, with raising money, and everything else, said, \u201cGod\ncouldn\u2019t do this to me again.\u201d And then, the hospital was so small, and I got terrible\ncramps. It was just built, and they brought in -- in the next room a woman from -- from\nsurgery, she said, \u201cKeep quiet.\u201d That lady just came out, she said -- I said, \u201cBut I\u2019m wet.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t even know that you break water. I never read up on it. So they found Robert right\naway, and he brought with him two doctors, two pediatricians, and he was putting in that\nstitch, and I said, \u201cRobert, are you knitting or purling?\u201d Because I design knitted clothes.\nThis is already under anesthetic. I had a -- he had to give me a spinal because my water\nbroke. And then all of a sudden I hear the other doctor, \u201cIs that you, Marsha?\u201d It was Dr.\nDanielson, his wife was one of my clientele. So you see, I was surrounded by friends\nwhen David was born. And I took him out of the incubator, and after six months I had to\nput him on a skim milk diet, thanks God. And he was reading and writing at two and a\nhalf years old. At three years old, he was -- he knew every president, he knew every\ncomposer. Now, he was not genius. I took him to UCLA. My father-in-law was a very,\nvery intelligent man, and David was his life, so he spent a lot of time with David. David\nhas -- has a photographic memory, like I do. I remember a lot of things as a child, don\u2019t\nforget, that I went through. A lot I forget because I blocked it out, but a lot I remember.\nAnd David has a photographic memory. So one day, he was running up the steps in my\nfather-in-law\u2019s apartment, and he says -- and he\u2019s reading the paper, he\u2019s running up, he\u2019s\nnot -- he\u2019s three years old, and he says, \u201cAppa, Castro is in Moscow.\u201d Yeah, my father-\nin-law should rest in peace, it was his life. One time he took a wooden spoon, and he hit\nhim on the behind. I\u2019ll never forget, he called me up, and he said, \u201cAppa,\u201d that\u2019s an\nHungarian father, he said, \u201cif you do it, 1t doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He loved him so much. In fact, I\nhad to take him to the doctor that treated my father, because the day before he jumped on\nhis bed and everything, and I heard him in his room praying, and he said, \u201cPlease God, if\nI did something wrong, bring my -- my grandfather back as -- as a baby again.\u201d So I took\nhim to his doctor, to my father-in-law\u2019s doctor, and he told him, Dr. Cohen, that his\ngrandfather was very sick, he could not survive, that, in fact, the last day he brought him\na lot of joy by being there.",
        "Q: Did -- did you have any particular hopes or plans for David that, as a -- as a survivor\nthat made a connection to that?",
        "A: Pll tell you something. I\u2019ve seen a lot of things happen between my American friends\nthat were always Jewish. If the son doesn\u2019t get to be a doctor, or a pharmacist, or\nanything else, and those kids were very unhappy. I never told David anything about the\nHolocaust till he went to go Bar Mitzvah. When -- when he wouldn\u2019t eat, I wouldn\u2019t say I\nwas hungry, why don\u2019t you eat? When he didn\u2019t eat I would say, \u201cDavid, you have to eat,\nthere are so many children hungry in China.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you adopt a couple?\u201d\nThat little fat monster told me that. But I never told David anything, anything. I never\nexposed him to it. David played Little League. I burned my hands on the making\nhamburger there [indecipherable] did in my life, run from the studio, run to the -- to the\nfield, made the hamburgers when it was my day. He played Little League, he loved\nsports, he did judo, anything. In fact, he was -- when he was very little, he was very\nsmart, but not coordinated. To -- my doctor, Dr. Jessup, told me, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take\nhim boxing or judo?\u201d So I took him for judo. So in the beginning he didn\u2019t want to go in\nbecause he didn\u2019t know how to tie his shoes. So I told him, \u201cThen leave it open.\u201d But\nlater on, this was the best thing that I ever did. But I never, never exposed him to the\nHolocaust before he was able to understand. And I won\u2019t tell any, any child about the\nHolocaust that is under 11 or 12 years old, because this is a very horrible story that\nhappened, and it can affect their life. And especially my son, 1t was important to me that\nhe doesn\u2019t feel guilty because of me. That he doesn\u2019t eat, or he doesn\u2019t eat. He didn\u2019t\nwant to be a doctor, he wanted to be a sports re -- the reporter, fine. This is your life, you\nlive it. At 21 he moved out of the house, we moved to the town house. Fine, you live your\nlife. I\u2019m not going to make scene. He 1s 40 years old, he is not married yet. I would love\nto have a grandchild, but if he doesn\u2019t want to get married yet, if he want to play the field,\nfine, what do I care?",
        "Q: So when did you tell him a little bit about your experience, and what happened?",
        "A: I told him before he went to -- he started studying for the Bar Mitzvah. I told him what\nhappened, very slowly, and very quietly, because he didn\u2019t want to study for his Bar\nMitzvah. I had to get a private rabbi. I did not belong to a temple, because -- this is\nanother story by itself, I\u2019m not going to go into it. And I -- I ra -- I had the rabbi, I ha -- I\nhired the shul -- a temple, and he had the most magnificent Bar Mitzvah that ever -- he\nhad everything -- at that time, everything was Calypso. And a friend of mine was in the\nlinen supply business. Everything was served flamb\u00e9, and it was kosher, glot kosher,\nbecause at that time I knew a lot of survivors already, and some of them were very\nreligious, and I wasn\u2019t going to commit a sin. So I found a place that was glot kosher, and\nit just opened, the Ventura Club. And -- but everything they gave you, they did your\nflowers, I didn\u2019t like. They gave me hundred dollar deposit, I paid 500 dollars for\nflowers. Imported hats from Mexico, with everything Calypso, every color. I didn\u2019t like\nhis orchestra, so I had another one for the grownups. I changed everything around. They\nwere supposed to do everything, I did everything. But I liked. But it was a beautiful Bar\nMitzvah. And, in fact, David was mostly an atheist. But now, as he 1s getting older, 1s\nvery, very Jewish inclined. And I never pushed him, and I never told him you have to be,\nbecause when came Christmas, we were at my mother-in-laws. Came Rosh Hashanah, we\nwere at my house. My mother-in-law made the be -- on -- on Passover, the best matzo\nballs there is. And I never -- in fact, when my father-in-law had his first heart attack, he --\nmy mother-in-law was running up the street to call us, and she was crossing herself, and\nDavid was only going one way. She star -- she called me up, she said -- as sad as it was\nthat -- where father is and everything, but said, \u201cI have to tell you something. David was\ngoing one way, and I said, David, why are you doing it?\u201d He said, \u201cAnya, I\u2019m half and\nhalf.\u201d You know, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the -- the funny part that comes into a sad life.",
        "Q: Let me ask you about your --",
        "A: I was very close to them, to my mother-in-law, and father-in-law, very close. In fact, I\nhad a ex-sister-in-law -- I have a sister-in-law that I\u2019m very close to. She\u2019s Catholic,\nbecause for me it doesn\u2019t matter what religion, what faith, what race, as long -- and\nespecially my mother-in-law and father-in-law, David was their life. That was the only\ngrandson, and that was their life. And my father-in-law, he didn\u2019t live to see it, only\nwanted to live to see David\u2019s Bar Mitzvah. My mother-in-law lived to see it, but my\nfather-in-law didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Just a quick follow up on your own faith. You don\u2019t have to go into the temple story --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- just a question. Did your faith change because of your war experience --",
        "A: Yes. And I\u2019m not going to lie to you like other people. It didn\u2019t change for the better. I\nwas -- come from a very religious family. And it\u2019s a town where it was the most famous\nyeshiva, Slabotka Yeshiva. Most of the finest rabbis came out, and my grandfather gave a\nlot of money for it. And he was very religious, and he was -- like I told you, I was his pet.\nAnd he was the first one to be taken away. With a hundred -- with 138, I don\u2019t know how\nmuch it here, but 103 degrees temperature. The first aktja that they had in the Kovno\nghetto, they took away my grandfather, my grandmother, both of them, but the closest\none I was to Shia and Bessa Schneider. And let me tell you -- my mother\u2019s family. And\none time -- my girlfriend died of kidney when she was 38 years old, for a transplant,\nmany, many years ago. And a very famous rabbi, Rabbi Newsbaum was at her home, but\nva -- he didn\u2019t go to ma -- many homes, but he came to Ethela\u2019s home. And I said, \u201cWhy,\nwhy the nice people die first?\u201d And he said to me, \u201cBecause God doesn\u2019t want them to\nsuffer.\u201d I said, \u201cThat is no excuse.\u201d I said, \u201cI have never done anything, my two little\nsisters have never done anything 1n their life.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy did -- one was three years\nold, she didn\u2019t even have a chance to -- to suffer, or not to suffer. This is no answer,\nRabbi.\u201d Then, when I came to the valley, and I was going to have David, I said, \u201cNow\nit\u2019s time to join a temple.\u201d I spent every penny to opening the studio. And Al and Juliet\nWest, they helped me out, I told you. And I went to a very famous temple, I don\u2019t\n[indecipherable] to tell you, Rabbi Weiss. Later on I was with him on the same ticket\nspeaking, with the federation, and then at -- at the big B\u2019nai Brith conference. He didn\u2019t\nrecognize me when I came to the microphone. And I came to him, and I said, \u201cI would\nlike to join your temple.\u201d And he said, \u201cIt cost 750 dollars to join the temple.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cIT can\u2019t afford it,\u201d [indecipherable] He said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you look for another\ntemple?\u201d And since then, I would never join a temple, and I was with him on one ticket\nthat -- that -- at the federation I didn\u2019t say a word. But, when the aliyah start coming in\nfrom Russia, we had a big convention, B\u2019nai Brith convention, and I was there, and it was\nin the aisles microphones, and I came up, and I said, \u201cRabbi, you want us to make Jews\nout of the Russian people. They are coming so poor, and we have to make Jews out of\nthem.\u201d I said, \u201cWasn\u2019t -- do you know me?\u201d He said, \u201cOh yes, Marsha, we were on the\nsame ticket at the federation, at the ballroom.\u201d I said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t you remember in 1957\nI came to you before my son was born, and I wanted to join your temple, and you said to\nme it cost too much money, I should look for another temple?\u201d I got such an applaud, 120\nwomen were there. Here he\u2019s giving -- this 1s such hypocritical -- he\u2019s giving us a lecture\nthat we should help the Russian Jews -- being je -- make them Jews, and -- and -- and --\nand 20 or 30 years ago he refused me to join his temple. He\u2019s not the rabbi there any\nmore. It\u2019s a very good temple, Temple Ariel.",

        "A: Pll tell you. You'll die laughing. I was sitting in my studio -- sitting in my studio,\nRobert Young was sitting there, he knitted on the set. I used mostly designed for the\nGracie Allen Show. Mostly, it was expensive and -- to have a dress designed by me, or\nthey knit it themself or we made it for [indecipherable] Ice Follies, Mrs. Sheepstead,\nLoretta Young, you know, I had most of the studio people. And we\u2019re sitting -- the\nowners of the Sportsman\u2019s Lounge at that time was Zuzu Fine, and Robert Young was\nsitting, and a very old actress by the name of Ann Harding, I don\u2019t know if people will\nremember, because at that time she was old already. She was on studio one or something,\nI saw the night before. And I get a phone call. I said, \u201cCan I talk to Mariashki\nSupporzhnikov?\u201d And I said, \u201cIsh bin mya,\u201d this woman is speaking Yiddish, I am\nspeaking German because I forgot how to speak Yiddish. I said, \u201cIsh bin Myashka sup,\u201d -\n- lam Myashka Suppozhn. But in German she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, \u201cMyashka\nSupporzhnikov didn\u2019t speak such a good German.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I am.\u201d She said no, and\nshe start talking in Jewish, and we talk and we talk and the people are there\n[indecipherable]. They are sitting there laughing like crazy for the conversation that\u2019s\ngoing on, and here I\u2019m sitting there, and -- and talking to her, and she said, \u201cNow wait a\nmoment. What kind of a coat did you wear in ghetto?\u201d I said, \u201cI wore a gray poodle coat,\nI'll never forget, with a big, big cub -- .\u201d What do you call it, that you put over your\nhead?",
        "Q: A hood?",
        "A: A hood.",
        "Q: A hood, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and it was made out of poodle cloth, because when I came into the ghetto, I was\nso young, that my clothes grew out of me. So my father found a piece of poodle cloth,\nand he made me a warm coat. And everybody envied me, of course. She said, \u201cOh, you\nare really Myashka Supporzhnikov.\u201d That night I was invited to a very big affair, and I\nstopped off in a home before we -- we went to the party, and from then on I start meeting\nmore and more survivors. I knew survivors, but I didn\u2019t really associate with them,\nbecause they were from Poland. I had nothing did -- I had -- we had nothing in common.\nSo I met a lot of Lithuanian survivors. And this is -- I mean, my life was always the\nmuseum, and always the Holocaust. The first time I start talking was here in the valley. It\nwas one time a very big tycoon, the Glickmans. He was in the eel -- real estate business,\nhe was a multi-millionaire, lost a lot of money. He was 13 years old, and he had the\nhavara group. Was many, many years ago, about 20 years, 30 years ago. And I went to\ntheir home, and a pr -- a -- a teacher from Grant High School at that time, they called it\nthe bagel factory, it was a Jewish high school, and they were the first builders of the\nStefan Weiss Temple, the Glickmans. And they called me over, they said, \u201cWould you\ntalk to havara group, tell them your story?\u201d That was the first time I start talking about\nthe Holocaust, it was about 32 years ago. When he brought me home, that professor, from\n-- from Grant High School, he said to Cornelius, \u201cI created another billi -- Billy Graham.\u201d\nFrom that day on, I start talking about the Holocaust to everyone that will listen, and\nnever stopped. And what happened is is -- but never, never did I tell anybody anything\nthat they didn\u2019t want to hear. The only thing that is before I went to go to be citizen 1n --\nand one of my clientele was a daughter-in-law of Professor J.C. Owens, he was the right\nhand of Hoover. And she said to me, \u201cIf you are going to be, be a Republican, not a\nDemocrat.\u201d And Cornelius, and his mother, and everybody, big Democrats. I says -- I\nsaid, \u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cIll bring you some documents, and I want Cornelius and you to\nread it together, because his English is a little bit better than yours.\u201d I said, \u201cThanks a lot\nMrs. Owens, you just did me a big favor. In front of all my clientele, you are telling me\nthat.\u201d She took it out of the safe, and she brought it to me, and I read the story, when\nHoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do\nsomething about the Jews that are being killed in Europe. He didn\u2019t come himself to Palo\nAlto, he sent somebody, and told them to inform Mr. Hoover that he cannot be bothered\nwith a handle -- handful of Jews. And since then, I came into a friends of mine house, a\nsurvivor also from Lithuania, that had a big picture of hers -- over her fireplace of\nRoosevelt, and that was in the 19 -- late 1950\u2019s, and I spit on his face, and she threw me\nout of her house. And now everything comes out in the open. What I knew in \u201953, is\ncoming out now, with the boat, and with everything else.",

        "A: No, no, absolutely not. When I first started there was people didn\u2019t even know there\nwas a Holocaust. Some Jewish people didn\u2019t know, like I told you, I talked to the havara\ngroup, and it was like I was, you know, something out of the blue. They were shocked\nthat there was a Holocaust. And these were very close friends of mine.",
        "Q: And that was in the late 50\u2019s, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: And that was in the -- in the li -- yeah, the late 50\u2019s, yes, definitely. And -- no, the\nbeginning of the 60\u2019s already. And the people were -- were shocked what was going on in\nthe Holocaust. Jewish people, friends of mine, Christian people. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if\nthey were Christian, or Jewish, or half and half, or whatever it is. So I made up my mind\nthen and then, that I\u2019m going -- not -- I was left for revenge, and mine only revenge will\nbe not to hurt people, but to teach them that this should never happen again. And that 1s\nmy revenge, and that why I\u2019m still speaking. And that -- we were very rich, we lost a lot\nof money. The same museum that I helped build, and paid out thousand, and thousand,\nand thousands of dollars, I\u2019m working that museum on a salary right now, through the\nfederation, at my age. But I have to, and as long as I can drive, and as long as I can work,\nI will do it. Cornelius is still working again, too. But Pll tell you something, maybe it\nmakes us happier this way. Sometimes I\u2019m very tired, I could hardly get done. Because a\nlot of people that work with me in the museum, that are in higher positions that I am, are\nvery misunderstanding, and don\u2019t understand the feeling. And I\u2019ve talked to somebody at\nthe federation the other week, and he says to me, \u201cWe have a big problem here, Marsha.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s right, psychologically, he said, \u201cYou are one of the high lite -- lay person, and\nnow you\u2019re staff, and that is a big problem.\u201d And he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t stand anything that\nis wrong.\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t, because you know, when I go out, and I raise in two days,\nfour and a half thousand dollars to put up banners, I want to be consulted if the banners\nare alright or not, because three of them were made, and it was selected the worst of\nthem.\u201d I said -- and that 1s what hurts me. That person that runs that museum, I cannot\nmention name, is very jealous of me, because when it comes -- anything that has to do\nwith museum, everybody knows me, the whole community. Starting from the federation,\nto the - to-- to black young adults, African American, to teachers, to everything else.\nEverybody knows me, and I hope they respect me, and that is the biggest problem. But I\nhave to work, and I -- this is the only job I know. And I\u2019ve learned, believe it or not, at\nmy age, the last three years I been working on the computer, and I\u2019m pretty good at it.",
        "Q: Good -- good for you. Good for --",
        "A: And I go out, and you know what? I was supposed to start as -- as a coordinator, and I\nwas on the level of higher pos -- not with money, but on a higher level, and she couldn\u2019t\ntake it. So she put me down as eight -- grade eight. I got the same salary, and I\u2019m union\nanyway, but she didn\u2019t want to have the same paper filled out every two weeks as I did.\nSo I was put as, instead of 10 plus to eight plus, and it didn\u2019t bother me, because I don\u2019t\ngo out for big honor and so on. I also very mu -- many times met, before I started\nworking, I went with Benjamin Meet, and many other people, to Washington for teacher\ntraining, to send out teachers to Yad Vashem, because I am part of the council of post-\nwar Jews organization. I am the treasurer for many years. In \u201991, we honored Benjamin\nMeet, and Vlodka from the American gathering. Benjamin Meet is one of the greatest\nmen that I\u2019ve ever met, because he brought the survivors together. The first gathering that\nwe went to was in Israel, the second one was in Washington. In fact, in the Washington\nmuseum, I just got a book from the Washington museum, I left it in our museum, is you\nopen the middle, and there is my best friend from ghetto. When I was a little girl he was\nmy boyfriend, Abe Malnik. And it\u2019s a big pictures of him, on a -- on a TV screen. I don\u2019t\nknow if you\u2019re seen it, the last jo -- the last book that came out. I also am in touch\nconstantly with Malsy at the book store, because we sell a lot of guides to you, called,\n\u201cThose Who Dared,\u201d and \u201cRescue.\u201d That was done by the Martyr\u2019s Memorial at that\ntime, under the leadership of Alex Grubman.",
        "Q: I imagine you also did a lot of interviews with Holocaust survivors later on. What did\nyou -- tell us more about that, what you learned from that experience.",
        "A: Pll tell you, I interviewed for the Shoah Foundation 110 survivors, because I needed it\n-- they paid me, and also I wanted to know a lot -- you see, I didn\u2019t want to talk about\nthings I didn\u2019t know, that you read out of a book. And when I arranged for the Holocaust\nmuseum, for the Martyr\u2019s Memorial, to go out for people to speak, and to give tours in\nthe museum, I\u2019ve always told them, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything that you didn\u2019t go through. You\ntalk only about your own experiences,\u201d because there was, at that time I coached Abe\nSpiegel, and I coached Ed Lasabnik, and I coached the first three chairs, the lay chairs.\nAnd I was the lay person that coached the -- those people. I also was fundraising for\nB\u2019nai Brith in the meantime, fundraising for ORT, but I could never take the presidency,\nbecause always came the museum ahead of it. I was -- I was one of the first people, with\nmy husband, with the Carters, and many people in the valley, with the Katz\u2019s, they were\nolder than we are. We raised money to establish the --",

        "A: Yeah. I -- to establish the Gateway of Mental Health, most of the famous hospitals in\nLos Angeles for -- for the Gateway of Health people. We bought the Hoover lot, and I\nand Cornelius were fundraising. I\u2019m very good at fundraising, and especially when I had\nthe money, and I gave, I got back a lot. Even now, when we needed banners, I raised the\nmoney for it. I work for the museum, but I really work with my heart. If you don\u2019t get a\nspeaker, I speak. If you don\u2019t -- we need to work the computer, I work the computer. If\nyou need this, I do this. But, the only thing that hurts me very badly is that the person that\nruns the museum does not like me. Absolutely doesn\u2019t understand survivors, and\nabsolutely doesn\u2019t like me. But that will change, I hope, in the near future.",
        "Q: You just said, doesn\u2019t understand survivors. Let me ask you -- there were so many\ndifferent --",
        "A: It was my own fault, Regina, because when the f -- the director left, and he was\nwriting a book that is just coming out, called, \u201cThe Deniers.\u201d It will come out in 2000, I\nhope I live to see it. And he didn\u2019t have much time. I was working just as coordinator,\nand then when he left, he wrote a letter to the head of the federation, that till they find a --\na -- a director, I can run the museum, and this person can help me. And I did that, and in\nthe long run, she got to be the director of the museum. She doesn\u2019t have a PhD., she has a\nMaster degree, but that\u2019s not important. Sh-She\u2019s very good as a part time curator, but not\nas good as a director, and I know I may get fired when she hears the tape.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s get away from that subject [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- what I really want",
        "A: It hurts me very much, this subject. Because the museum has to stay, because I put --\nthis was the first museum built in the United States of America. We had breakfast with\nElie Wiesel. I still have the picture of me and Elie Wiesel, and Freddie Diamond. And\nElie Wiesel at that breakfast, was a very small breakfast from the federation, said that this\nwas a jewel. We were on the 12\" floor of the Jewish Federation building. And then we\nstart -- they start building the Washington museum, and Lydia Bodka is the president of\nthe Council of Post-War Jews organization. And every year in February -- now I can\u2019t,\nbecause I work, we went, and when I had the money, and we helped Latka and Benjamin\nMeet send people all through the concentration camps, and Yad Vashem -- teachers, to be\nable to teach the Holocaust. When I started to -- not lecture, I don\u2019t call it a lecture -- talk\nabout my experiences in the Holocaust -- I\u2019m not a lecturer, I\u2019m not a teacher. I -- 1t was\ndone here a little bit, and there a little bit, and there a little bit, and people came by the\nhundreds to the museum when it first opened, because for them it was new. I was 10\ndays, I'll show you, from the president of the University of Utah, southern Utah. I was\nsupposed to be 48 hours, I stayed for 10 days. I set up a Holocaust museum in the library,\nand the kids were coming down from the mountains, the Indian kids, and all kind of kids.\nAnd it was called Jewish week. And there was all different kind of illel, did a lot of\ncooking, and dancing, and so on. There was one Jewish students in the whole -- at that\ntime it was a college, now it\u2019s a university. So -- and I paid for everything, and then there\nwas a director from Yad Vashem working, Shome Balmar, at that time, at our museum,\nand I called, and I saw all those big people from Israel, from the American Jewish\ncommittee, and so on. So I -- right away I send him a ticket he should come right away to\nUtah. And then he lectured at the washing -- at the Einstein hall. So you see, whenever I\ntalk, and whatever I do, I always end up Holocaust -- talking about the Holocaust, and\nwhat it should be done about the Holocaust. You know, about a couple of weeks ago, I\ncouldn\u2019t get speakers. And the museum 1s small now, very small, because we are sharing\ntill the other building is finished, we are sharing the whole first floor of a building with\ntwo other agencies of the federation, with the library, and the Jewish Historical Society.\nSo, when they have a big group, we divide it in three parts. We send them to the\nmonument, we have a big monument at Palm Pacific Park, that was built by survivors,\nand I was on the committee too. In fact, I\u2019m engraved in the committee. And we have the\nmuseum, so what we do is we divide it in three groups. And I couldn\u2019t get any speakers\nthat day, so I spoke to three different groups at the same time, the same day. And worked.",
        "Q: I asked --",
        "A: So, you can see that Holocaust is my life.",
        "Q: Yeah, so it\u2019s --",
        "A: Not the Holocaust. I\u2019m sorry for that expression, the hol -- to remember the Holocaust,\nthat this should never happen again. It -- not only Jews died in the Holocaust. I was in a\ndeath camp, Stutthof, where on the other side there were Catholic priests, there were\nGypsies, there were homosexuals, people -- prisoner of wars, people that didn\u2019t agree\nwith Hitler, that were killed in that place. Stutthof is the only camp that the original gas\nchamber -- the original crematorium is still standing. But this is the forgotten death camp.\nI wrote a couple of articles in papers about the forgotten death camp, and if you notice,\nwhen you were here originally, I made that phone call the minute there is to give out\nmoney for survivors or anything, I call all my people that I know, and if they can\u2019t make\nthe phone calls, I do it. We have a guide in the museum that we composed for where and\nwhen the people should call. For insurance claims, for -- for Swiss money, for everything.\nIf anybody calls -- we send out about at least -- at least 800 -- 800 to a thousand of those\nguides for survivors to do it.",
        "Q: Marsha, h-how do you feel about -- no, let me -- let me say this differently. S-\nSurvivors have so many different life stories, and so many different --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: -- experiences. However, is there something from your experience, who has\ninterviewed -- interviewed a lot of them, too, something that is united --",
        "A: The something that bothers me 1s that a lot of them are adding certain things that other\npeople went through, that they discussed with. And that what bothers me when I was\ninterviewing, because I read a lot about the Holocaust, even for the Polish people, and\nAuschwitz, and -- and Majdanek, and everything else. I worked with, \u201cThe Triumphant\nSpirit,\u201d with Nick Decalsio on the book. And it bothers me when people -- like take the\nHungarians, from Budapest I\u2019m talking about. They didn\u2019t -- they -- they only start\nsuffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944. But they also suffered, and a\nlot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything. But I don\u2019t think they went through\nthe things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939. Like, I\ncouldn\u2019t say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- \u201939, or the\nGerman Jews. But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived\npretty good. You understand what I mean? And like again with the Anne Frank\u2019s diary.\nYou take the Anne Frank\u2019s diary, there\u2019s hundreds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne\nFrank\u2019s diary was found first. And I want to tell you a story about Anne Frank\u2019s diary.\nMy cousin, Leah Salisbury that converted to baptism -- I don\u2019t know what she converted,\nshe married a guy -- she\u2019s my mother\u2019s cousin, she wasn\u2019t my cousin, she was the literary\nagent to Anne Frank\u2019s diary in -- in America. I never had a lot to do with her, because her\nmother was Jewish, and she didn\u2019t do it very much, she only had to do -- she only had to\ndo with show people And she wanted me to come to her estate in -- in Sanvits shwanza,\nsomewhere in New York, Connecticut, whatever it is -- I don\u2019t know what it -- what it is.\nI never went, because I didn\u2019t like it the way she treat her mother. It was her mother 80\"\nbirthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother\u2019s aunt. And I went there --\nAunt Molly, and her biggest pleasure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and\nthings like that. And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left. So when\nshe send me tickets when Anne Frank\u2019s diary was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I\ndidn\u2019t go. And I don\u2019t really believe in Anne Frank\u2019s diary. I believe that it happened, of\ncourse, it did happen. But there is so many diaries been written, there\u2019s so many children\nbeen hidden, there\u2019s so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three\nyears old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn\u2019t even know what it means that little piece\nof bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or\nanything. But she knew every German. They were so smart, like God has give them more\nhead, or something. Every German that walked by, she knew by name, when she was\nhidden. You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my\nmother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters. And that why she was killed at 34\nyears old, in Stutthof. I don\u2019t know, like I told you, where she was killed. Now that I read\na lot more about -- when I start reading more about Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz, and\neverything that was going on, I don\u2019t know where she was killed.",
        "Q: So you think though that a lot -- many survivors, or at least some who speak about\ntheir experience, bring in something that they have read in the meantime --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- or -- or seen on the -- in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Definitely, and that why most of our speakers of the museum can only speak about\ntheir experiences. If they do not speak about their experiences, they are not called again.\nBecause, you know, like I told you, some very intelligent men ask me about the Warshaw\nghetto, and I told him, \u201cI would insult your intelligence if I tell you, because I read the\nsame book that you can pick up off the shelf, and read it in there in the library.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you think that the public\u2019s perception of survivors has changed over the years, that\nthe American public looks at survivors in a different way than they have?",
        "A: They look in a much nicer way than they did, because the survivors made something\nof themself. That why I like the survivors to buy, \u201cThe Triumphant Spirit,\u201d and see what\npeople made of themself. Like, the biggest toy factory 1s owned by Mr. Cort. The -- that\ngave a lot of money to the Washington museum, he gave a lot of money to the\nmonument. He gives, and gives, and gives, for the Holocaust. Mr. Webb. Most of the\nsurvivors. Mr. Chappel, here in los -- I can only talk about the people in Los Angeles that\nI know. One of my very, very good friend, was much older than I was, he just not long\nago died, helped build the monument in Florida, Abe Resnick. You must have heard of\nhim. He comes from Kovno. He was in Kovno ghetto part time. I knew people that -- that\nmade so much of themself, the survivors, that you have to have respect for them. You just\nhave to. Even if you don\u2019t like what they tell you. Even if you feel guilty that you\ncouldn\u2019t help them, that you didn\u2019t help them. You still have to have respect for what\nthey made of themself. You take me, a little girl comes into -- married a guy that most of\nthe family is Christian, I\u2019m Jewish, very, very brought up Jewish, come from the\nconcentration camps, my husband was in a labor camp. Thanks God my mother-in-law\nwas very understanding and helped a lot of Jews, I told you she\u2019s a Righteous Christian\nand everything. But still, my brother-in-law was in America, having -- living a playboy\nlife, you understand what I mean? And so on. And here comes that little -- poor little girl,\nyou know. And thanks I God -- but I didn\u2019t let it happen to me. This is the survivor\u2019s\nspirit. I didn\u2019t let them think of me that he is better than I am. No. I am the one that is\nfeared. I didn\u2019t fear him, he feared me. You know why\u201d Because I didn\u2019t let him get\naway with it. Because I was better than he was. He didn\u2019t go through what I went\nthrough, and had to go to school and everything. His father paid for everything. I did it\nmyself. Do you understand what I am talking about? Maybe people won\u2019t understand\nwhat I am talking about, but I feel very, very good about it.",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s very clear. But my question 1s still, so you have really managed to, with\ngreat determination, and work, and spirit, to build a new life.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "Q: Still --",
        "A: My life was very rich, thanks God.",
        "Q: Did the --",
        "A: I went to Europe for a -- for months, and month. I was very wealthy at one time, and I\nwent to Europe, and I went to the first one -- when Hawaii wasn\u2019t a state yet, I went to\nHawaii. I went -- my friends were very well-to-do friends, and some of them took us to\nLa Jolla, and you know, I went to places where people -- I don\u2019t say -- you know, my son\nwas born a little later, like I told you, I couldn\u2019t have children, so I had a little more time\nthan the other people had. They had to bring up their family. A lot of the survivors were\nlonesome, so they got married just with anybody, you understand what I mean? Maybe\nthey -- they didn\u2019t fit, but they made a life together, they brought up their children\nbeautiful. The only thing that I don\u2019t agree, that most of the survivor pushed their\nchildren. And I was -- stood by it, and watched it, and it hurts. And a lot of them are sick.\nA lot of them are very sick, and a lot of them need psychiatrists.",
        "Q: Did you ever need help?",
        "A: Pll tell you. Many times I\u2019ve need help, but you know what? My husband was my\nbest psychiatrist. I talked a lot of things over with him. And like I said, I told you I\u2019ve\nlearned to do self hypnosis, because nobody -- I was too strong for anybody to hypnotize\nme. And I made a lot of friends. I didn\u2019t have time -- I didn\u2019t have -- I lectured on the\nHolocaust, I worked. My studio was -- you know, I had contact with very unusual people.\nYou know, show people are very unusual people. You know, like Cary Grant ordered\nfrom me a -- a golf sweater, and he send in his manager to bargain with me. And I told\nhim, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to me. He doesn\u2019t want it, let him go somewhere else.\u201d A hand\nknitted golf sweater in cashmere. Zsa Zsa Gabor once says to me, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have to\npay you the bill, my name is good enough, that I come to you.\u201d I said, \u201cMuch bigger\npeople than you are coming to me, and I don\u2019t mean show people. I mean scientists. I\nmean other people, just -- just any people. They don\u2019t have to be in show peop -- show\nbusiness to have a brain.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell her that there is no brain, I\u2019m sorry. But\nthat\u2019s it. You know, she had looks, and that was important.",
        "Q: I just -- I just read a quote recently, and I just want to give you that quote and see what\nyour response is. A scholar recently wrote that still in this country survivors are very\noften seen either way, either as anxious ghosts, or as secular saints.",
        "A: This is full of baloney. I think a survivor is a normal person, absolutely normal, much\nmore normal as some of the Americans I\u2019ve met. And believe me, most of my friends are\nAmericans. And like I told you, 1t went by eight years before I met with the survivors.\nAnd I tell you something, I had one girlfriend, h-her son -- I didn\u2019t have children yet, and\nher son only ate lamb chops with ketchup. I mean, this is abnormal. If my son would do\nit, I would say he\u2019s crazy. I wouldn\u2019t make it lamb chops a -- and if a daughter, God\nforbid, took a piece of her lamb chops, Ann Marie had two problems. I mean, this 1s\nabnormal. But for s -- for saying the survivor are abnormal, no. I feel -- I feel much more\n-- much more up to date, and up to life, and if I die tomorrow, I have lived a very rich,\nbeautiful life. Poor or rich, even if I lost my money -- at one time I was very depressed\nbecause I di -- we [indecipherable] twice -- three times, but then I talk to myself. I said,\n\u201cMarsha, you lost so much in your life, does those things mean anything to you?\u201d After\nthe earthquake, when I lost everything. And then in the middle of the shakes I went to\nhelp a friend that lived up in the hills, in the dark, with my husband, because she was\nthere alone. That was more important to me than my Rosenthal, and my Lalique, and\neverything else. To get into the car in the dark, and the shakes were still going, you know,\naftershake, to go and help my friend. And would any average American do that? And I\nfeel myself they would. And that why I call myself an American. I worked for the man\nthat I like. I do everything that the country needs, because that country gave me life, gave\nme freedom, gave me everything.",
        "Q: Are there things that you are critical of in -- in American culture and society?",
        "A: Yes, to a certain extent about the schools, very much so. That why I send my ha -- my\nson in the beginning to a private school. When I went in the public school, it was\nhorrible. And there\u2019s a lot of things that -- that could be -- when I first came to this\ncountry it was so peaceful, it was so beautiful in 1949. You could walk on the streets, you\ncould have a ball. And now all this murdering, and everything that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s --\ndoesn\u2019t come out of the people, it\u2019s the way the people are treated. And if you say, oha\nblack American did it -- I -- I mean A-African American did it, or a -- a -- a -- a-- a -- O-\nOriental did it, or this one did it. What about the skinheads, what they did to the\nsynagogues in Sacramento? What about Jewish people that do certain things? And what\nabout Christian white people that do certain things? There\u2019s no such a thing, I -- unity is\nthe most important thing, and that country does not have unity right now. That\u2019s the\nproblem. And that why it\u2019s very important that the kids in school, or in college, or in the\nuniversity, are learning about unity. That the person is flesh and blood. They are not --\neven an animal is protected by the animal society, but the -- the African American that\ndoesn\u2019t have food 1s not protected. I know what it means to be without food. I know what\nit means to be cold. I know those things, so I feel with those people. In a country that is\nthat rich, and helps everybody else. Kosovo, Shmosovo, everything. Help your country,\ntoo. I don\u2019t say they shouldn\u2019t help the people. They definitely should. But help your\ncountry, too.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape three, side A, interview with Marsha Loen.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMarsha Loen. This is tape number three, side B, and Marsha would like to -- to read a\npoem now, but you should probably introduce it, and say something first. Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. I was hurt by a friend, so I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it, so I went home --\nyou know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a amateur poet. I don\u2019t write all odays, I just write rhymes.\nSo I would like to read you the poem. The poem is called, \u201cFriendship.\u201d Friendship is a\ngift from God. The love from a second person that draws you like a lightning rod. It takes\npatience, it takes understanding, because if you break those rules, it cannot easily be\nmended. That is why we go through life to find a way to understand that person who 1s a\nfriend, and try to keep that friendship, and lend a hand. But if that person get jealous and\nbitter, 1t is hard to keep your cool and ditter. To forgive it\u2019s easy, sometimes hard. Who\nknows the right thing, and who is smart? Is that person who calls himself my friend, or is\nthat person I do not understand. The only one who knows 1s me, I feel the love, I feel the\nglee. To be bitter, and to hate is very easy, but there is better things in life to keep my\nbusy. Hatred hurts only that person who projects it. That is why I say, forget hate, keep\nyour friendship and don\u2019t neglect it.",
        "Q: So friendship is very important to you?",
        "A: Yes, very. And if somebody hurts me, I just -- I can\u2019t take it sometimes. So, instead of\narguing, or doing something, I just write a poem, or just an article, or anything. What I\nwanted to tell you is, Regina, that I\u2019m a very lucky person that I\u2019m connected with the\nJewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. They gave me a job at a certain age, when\nnobody would have given me a job, when I need it. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m very grateful to\nthem, and I will be grateful to them the rest of my life. And that again 1s the Jewish\nFederation of Greater Los Angeles.",
        "Q: Did you ever go to -- to es -- to Israel, or to pal -- not to Palestine, to Israel?",
        "A: I went to Israel. I practically ended up in Palestine, but -- when I was smuggling than\nthe people, but I went to Israel. The first time I was supposed to go to Israel was in \u201967,\nand the war broke out. I was in Russia. I did not go to any of the concentration camp, I\nnever will go. In fact, when I was in Lithuania -- that\u2019s why I went -- I did not go to\nKovno, I stayed in Wilno. Because I won\u2019t give him the satisfaction, to go to Poland and\nspend money, to the murderer. It went to Kovno -- I went to Lithuania, to Russia because\nI had to. There was a reason, there was a mission. My sis -- older sister was there. And at\nthat time I went as a friend, because it was still Communistic, and I had to wait two and a\nhalf years for a visa. And then I had to stay in a certain hotel, and everything else. But\nnever, never, would I go to Poland, or to anywhere where there are concentration camps,\nand have give them the satisfaction to spend money there. I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it. I went\nall over Europe. I went to the Mamblon, I went to Italy. I know there were concentration\ncamps everywhere. There was one in Ebensee that I didn\u2019t even know. I was skiing in\nEbensee with my husband. We went there because how far was it from Tronkishin where\nwe had the hotel, and we went from -- from -- from Linz, to -- to -- to ve -- I went to --\nwe went on our honeymoon, we stayed at the Vicearussel near the Glosegrog, you know,\nthe -- what do you call, the oldest lakes. It was in alt -- no, it was in Wolfgangsay.",
        "Q: Wolfgangsay.",
        "A: Wolfgangsay. And I went always on trips all through Europe and everything, but still,\nI went to Italy, I went to -- like I told, went -- we went to the Mamblon. In \u201967, I was\nsupposed to -- I went to Russia, and then my husband meet me, we were supposed to go\nto Israel, but the war broke out, it was the Six Day War, so I couldn\u2019t go there. So I went\nthere the year after, and then I went for the gathering, and then I went for the -- went in\n1979. Then I went in 1985, and they had the -- for the partisans. Then I went again in\n1989. And then when my ankle broke, it\u2019s very hard for me to travel by plane, so I\nhaven\u2019t been there since. But I have papers, I\u2019Il show it to you. I have a beautiful citation\nfrom the Mengele twins, because I always visit people that were connected with the --\nwith the Holocaust, and they were hurt by the Holocaust, and made friends with them,\nand did something for them that I could. I went -- they were here, I had a symposium for\nthem in Los Angeles. I can tell you, I went in Israel, I have -- I found family in Israel, and\nI was very happy. Whenever I went there, I was very, very happy.",
        "Q: Did you feel differently Jewish, in a certain way?",
        "A: No. Absolutely no. My cousins, and my aunt, they\u2019re not Orthodox. They are Jewish,\nthey -- they -- they -- they have their religion, they go to temple, and everything else, they\nhave the Passover. In fact, one day I was there on Passover one time, and mostly I stayed\nin a hotel, I stayed with my cousin Leah. And my -- my uncle died first, then I -- they\nwere well-to-do people, they have a -- they had a electric factory, and so on. My cousin\nLeah\u2019s husband had a garage. So there was no problems of any kind, and they were very\nhappy to come here, and I was very happy to go to Israel. And most of it was the\ngathering of the survivors in Israel that Benjamin Meet arranged. I went to Yad Vashem,\nand one year -- see, my mother-in-law died. She was brought out of the Hungarian club\ninto Israel, and they gave a big, big deal for her, but she didn\u2019t have time. She was\nhonored here in \u201968 with some trees in Israel. W-We put in Putnam. I have a big citation\nfor her. Like I said, I don\u2019t take citation all over the place. And then I went -- then I went\nin \u201985, and I insisted -- because they knew me in Yad Vashem arad, and ev -- a-and sh-\nshow me -- everybody knows me -- knew me, and so I say -- I insisted that I want the tree\nalready planted. So they went through the books, and they found it, and the tree was\nplanted with two other people from Holland, at the same time. And it looks down on the\nfallen soldiers, from the mountain. I haven\u2019t seen it since, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that. But\none of these days, maybe if we\u2019re still alright, and Cornelius 1s alright, we'll take a trip\nand go over and see the tree.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Yad Vashem in Jerusalem have a different -- it -- is it -- 1s it different\nfor you than the othen -- other museums that you know in this country?",
        "A: Yad Vashem is the most important museum, because it was first built in jer -- in jer --\nit\u2019s built in Jerusalem, in our -- you see, everybody has a background, except us Jews.\nOne comes from Poland, one comes from Lithuania, one comes -- but now they have a\ncountry, okay? We always had a country, it was always the Jewish country, Israel, the\ncountry of the Jews, but we have a country, and in that country was the first Holocaust\nmuseum built. And then there is another one, the -- I forgot the name of it, it\u2019s ina\nkibbutz. Loch -- Loch hamma cut tahowt. It\u2019s a more partisan, and so on. I helped with\nthat one, too. And Dr. Kulka -- I told you, Dr. Harry Kulka took me through the museum,\nthen he took me to the University of Jerusalem. And I was from ORT, I -- from the first\ngold pins, I had, and from the first people on the -- in Tel Aviv, I -- University of\nEngineering is our name on it, mine and Cornelius\u2019. I -- I don\u2019t go there very often now,\nand many places. I don\u2019t even fly to Las Vegas to my son, he comes here, cause it\u2019s very\nhard on my ankle, it formed arthritis. So when I went to Washington, I went on crutches,\nthe first time to be taped, not the first time to Washington, because I was there. I have\npictures on Washington when it still say be careful, and they just had the bottom built,\nyou know. And then we ha -- I have the hard hat. Here is a little thing there -- right there,\npick it up, next to the lake is the Washington museum, right there.",
        "Q: It\u2019s on this one?",
        "A: That was given to me, yes. You can read it.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a little model with a plaque that says, US Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, a campaign to remember Marsha Loen, and it shows the museum.",
        "A: Yes, and it\u2019s -- I put on -- on -- what is that called, that hard stuff?",
        "Q: Oh, I\u2019m not very good at that.",
        "A: Granite, granite.",
        "Q: Granite.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: It\u2019s real granite, yes.",
        "Q: Very nice.",
        "A: That was given by -- by af -- to me.",
        "Q: PIl put it back a little later.",
        "A: That\u2019s alright.",
        "Q: I have, of course, always one more question.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Which events in this country, in -- in the -- in -- in the USA, in America over the years\nhave been really important to you? And they don\u2019t have to be necessarily related to the\nHolocaust. Any movement, any event -- political event?",
        "A: First place, the Fourth of July, the independence of America, because the\nindependence of Israel is very important to me. So there is a connection, why I love that\nholiday so much. The second one, I can tell you that\u2019s not connected with the -- is the Bill\nof Rights, because everybody is created equal. Cause if I don\u2019t think like that, who\nshould?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think --",
        "A: Oh, of course, I like all the holiday. I like the turkey on Thanksgiving, like I like my\nmatzo balls on Passover, my turkey has to be done on Thanksgiving. You understand\nwhat I mean?",
        "Q: Yeah, I guess I was --",
        "A: I\u2019m very traditional.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t have to ask you whether the women\u2019s movement was very meaningful to you,\nbecause you li --",
        "A: No, absolutely not, absolutely not, because I'll tell you something. It\u2019s important for\npeople that the woman should have a voice. It\u2019s important, any person. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s\nwoman, half man, half woman, whatever it is, should have a voice in the country, because\nit\u2019s a democratic country. It\u2019s a country built by -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a melting pot. You\nunderstand what I mean? So it\u2019s important that the mo -- women movement, but an effect\non me, not. What has a tremendous effect on me is that the second generation is\ninterested in the Holocaust, and especially Dr. Gary Shiller, that is the president of the\nsecond generation. I admire him tremendously, and I hope he\u2019s our next chair of the\nmuseum.",
        "Q: Why do you --",
        "A: Because the second generation should take over.",
        "Q: You know, that was another question that I had. How do you see the impact of the\nHolocaust survivor testimonies, on the overall Holocaust consciousness memory in this\ncountry?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a good idea. I don\u2019t think it should be pushed down anybody\u2019s throat, I\u2019m\nsorry. If somebody wants to know about the Holocaust, they should be able to -- going in\n-- like in the Washington, the learning center, and push a button, and know what went on.\nIf somebody wants to bring their school out to the museums, wond -- that is the most\nwonderful thing in the world. If somebody -- if you have teacher training like we have in\nthe museum every year, a teacher training, and we do it with different agencies, like the\nADL, the labor committee, the American Bureau of Jewish Education, we do it together,\nand that is very important. Teacher training, so the teacher knew, when it comes to\nhistory, that, like the Spanish Inquisition, and the Crusaders, this also has to be told in\nhistory, because it happened, and it happened to a people, and for no reason at all. And\nit\u2019s good for the people in America to know it, because like I said, it\u2019s such a melting pot,\nthat the people should get along together properly.",
        "Q: What would you say to some of those people who think that there is now a little too\nmuch emphasis maybe, on Holocaust education, to the detriment of other elements of\nJewish culture.",
        "A: I would tell them, like you g -- like the Jews go on Yom Kippur to temple, and pray.\nThat happened 2,000 years ago. This only happened 50 some odd years ago, and believe\nme, much, much more that happened on Yom Kippur. And I think the Yom HaShoah is\nthe most important thing, for any religion, or any people. It\u2019s important for us Jews, but a\nlot of people should come and see it, and hear it. Because this 1s like going to temple on -\n- on Yom Kippur. This happened 2,000 years ago, but it\u2019s still the tradition, and we still\ndo it. And people stand in line to get tickets to go to it. But the Yom HaShoah only\nhappened 56 years ago, and six million of our people were killed. And that is -- that is our\nyom -- that is my Yom Kippur. Do you know in the beginning, before the survivors start\ndying off, I was jealous of a funeral, I told you on the tape. You know. And now, I\u2019m\nafraid to go to funerals. I\u2019m afraid to pick up the telephone, because the survivors are\ngoing so fast. And that why the testimony is so important, it\u2019s very important, that it\nshouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Look at what happened to the Spanish Inquisition. What do you\nread in the dictionary? A date, a time, what happened, and finished with. Are there books\non it? Not many. And look at what happened, and it\u2019s practically forgotten. This will\nnever be forgotten, as long as I can help it.",
        "Q: How do you feel about the movies that have come out, let\u2019s say since the late 70\u2019s,\nwhere th-the pop -- the popular culture representation of the Holocaust is -- how do you\nput it --",
        "A: Sometimes it\u2019s overdone, and sometime it\u2019s not true. The \u201cSchindler List,\u201d is the one\nthat is the closest, and still it\u2019s still a movie. Let\u2019s not kid ourself. The best one that I ever\nsaw was last month, \u201cThe Shoah,\u201d because it was interviews. And you see what\ninterviews can do.",
        "Q: In the hands of a master.",
        "A: Of a master is right. And there\u2019s the -- you still see those little pieces of anti-Semitism\nwas flying in the background, but people don\u2019t notice it, and -- certain people notice. And\nI think he did the best that ever was, I\u2019m sorry. Spielberg was alright, I fainted, I went to\nthe bathroom. I -- I never fainted in my life, but I -- all of a sudden I had to run to the\nbathroom and throw up. But I came back -- because I was the volu -- Los Angel -- Valley\nTimes ask me I should get about three or four survivors at the opening of \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList,\u201d and then the lady interviewed us, the reporter, and I did, and I watched it, and I\nnever watched it again. But I did interview survivors, and I\u2019ve learned a lot from\nsurvivors by interviewing them, the 110 survivors.",
        "Q: I want to follow up on that, but let me ask you, what was the most difficult thing for\nyou to watch in the \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d movie?",
        "A: When they carried those children on the carts. This is when I row -- run out and throw\nup, because I\u2019m sure my little sisters was carried somewhere on a cart, or disappeared\nsomewhere, somehow.",
        "Q: And -- and what are --",
        "A: The shooting, and everything else, I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve -- I -- I -- I went through it. You\nunderstand what I mean? You have to ask that from an American. You understand,\nRegina? But I personally, when the children on the cart, when they were carrying in that\ncamp, this is what I couldn\u2019t take it.",
        "Q: Are there still some images and sounds, or so -- or memories that -- that -- that follow\nyou to -- to this day?",
        "A: Yes. My mother yelling to me, if you survive, Myashinka, go to Palestine, and find\nSoatsky. And that was my aunt in Israel, Sarah. And also another thing is when they\nseparate me, the man and the woman, when they brought us to Stutthof in cattle cars, and\nthey separated the man and the women, send my father to Dachau, and my mother and\nme and the kids to Stutthof, and my father was yelling, \u201cGive us the poison tablets, give\nus the poison tablets. You don\u2019t want that.\u201d And my mothers said, \u201cNo. Even if a finger\nis left alive, Iam going where the Jewish people are going.\u201d But let that end on a real\nhappy thought. I\u2019m an old lady now, I work. You see we live a pretty normal life, pretty\nAmerican. My accent I couldn\u2019t get rid of, I went for speech therapy, I couldn\u2019t get rid of\nit, I\u2019m sorry. And --",
        "Q: I like it.",
        "A: Thank you. I don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t help it. And you see, I have a s-son, that goes -- you\nheard him go already twice since you are here. He lives in Las Vegas, he has his own life\nto live. And he comes -- is coming out now on my birthday, on the 28\", cause I can not\ndrive and fly by plane. And then, I don\u2019t like Las Vegas, it\u2019s too | -- noisy, and too much\nthings. Last time I went to Las Vegas two years ago on Thanksgiving, and he had a\nstomachache. We were supposed to go out for Thanksgiving. So now I said forget it. If I\nwant to play cards, I go to one of the casinos, and that\u2019s all -- they\u2019re here in Los\nAngeles. I don\u2019t have to go and see those -- that they spend thousand -- there\u2019s so many\nthousands of homeless people lying around the streets all over America, and they\u2019re\nbuilding millions and millions of dollars hotels in Las Vegas. Not that we don\u2019t need it,\nwe need that too, but there 1s a limit to everything. Yesterday I went shopping. There\nwere standing people, and collecting for AIDS, near Juan\u2019s. So I sent Cornelius in to get\ncanned food for them. And I tried to give as much as I can. When I had the money,\neverybody got. But now I try to give as much as I can. In fact, somebody told me I\u2019m too\ngenerous. Because when I drive by in the morning, I drive by a bakery that has bagels,\nand I had on a -- a -- a department in the federation, they used that I bring them bagels\nand cream cheese in the morning, for the department. So if -- if I can -- now we are\nseparated, the federation and the museum, and in different places till the building is\nredone. So now I have to wait till somebody comes to pick it up, or I run over and take it\nover. And this is my biggest pleasure, even if it costs me money, that I work, and it\ncomes to me very hard. But this is my pleasure.",
        "Q: I have one more question, but let\u2019s stick with pleasures then.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] what -- what else gives you pleasure? What --",
        "A: What gives me pleasure? Like I told you, I had my studio, and I did a lot of knitting,\nso I do that a little bit, and it gives me pleasure to go to art show, museums. And it give\nme pleasure to -- do you know what I like to watch? This is the craziest thing, the classic\nmovies, the old movies. Isn\u2019t that ec -- that relaxes me. And after reading a Holocaust\nbook, or something else, I buy myself a little romance book, to relax me. So I lay down in\nbed, and Cornelius watches television downstairs, and I read that -- and I go from the first\npage, to the middle, to the last page, to know what the ending is. And that relaxes me, and\nI fall asleep with it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s fast reading. My last question actually is you mentioned before that\nyou learned from the Holocaust survivors a lot. Think -- think about a few examples.",
        "A: An example is that I learned that they are -- some are very, very -- how do you say it --\nhow do -- | -- say -- some are very depressed, and very down, and you have to be around\nthem, but it happens very seldom to pick them up. I also learned that when I go to a party,\nthey dress like young girls, 70 and 75 year old women. They want to stay forever young,\nbecause they never had a childhood. And they never had, really, a young life, because\nthey had to work, and bring up a family, and everything else. To me, being a designer, it\nhurts my eyes. But I know what they feel, psychologically. The third thing is what\nbothers me tremendously is that the survivor money is handled by Americans. And that\nhurts very badly, because there 1s a lot of survivors, and needy survivors still alive. I get -\n- I got acall from a 91 year old woman that has nothing to eat. A survivor.",
        "Q: Because of the so -- it takes -- 1t takes them too long to process it, or that it\u2019s not\nenough --",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not enough. What -- what can she do, a woman, she\u2019s 91 years old, she needs\nsome help. She needs somebody to help her, or be put in a home. Or when a survivor\ngoes into a state home, and there is millions of dollars in -- in New York. A survivor\nshould never, after what they went through, stay in a state home, should be treated\ncompletely different. Not because he\u2019s a survivor, and he\u2019s something special. He should\nhave -- his end should be easy on that person, if it\u2019s a man or woman. Maybe I\u2019m wrong,\nmaybe I am expecting too much.",
        "Q: But how -- how --",
        "A: Like we\u2019re getting the money from Switzerland, and it\u2019s going on education, it\u2019s going\non everything else. But they don\u2019t remember when they tore my earrings off my ear. And\nmy little ring that my grandfather gave me to get away. And I didn\u2019t want to give it, and\nmy mother said, \u201cGive it to them, give it to them.\u201d They don\u2019t remember when they told\nus 1f you don\u2019t bring in your goods, plus your ironing, plus our electrical appliances. Not\nonly the gold, and the silver, and the platinum, the electric appliance and everything,\nyou'll be shot. Everybody\u2019s forgotten that. And they say that the Jews are greedy,\nbecause we -- we -- we -- we ask what is belonging to us, that\u2019s coming to us. They\nhaven\u2019t seen nothing from it yet. Not for me. I need it, too, believe me I do. Driving\nevery day over the canyon to go to work, and then have to listen to a lot of things that I --\nI am very ve -- get very upset, and I come home, and I get sick. Not from the Holocaust,\nthat I am told, from my superiors. You understand? It\u2019s not easy on me, but I needed\nwork, and I have to stay. Don\u2019t you think it would help me if I had some money, what\nwas taken away from me? And -- and I help. I am on -- I am on the council, I am the\ntreasurer of the council. Today was supposed to be a meeting in my house, we\u2019re\nhonoring a survivor that\u2019s going to be 90 years old. We honored Latka and Benjamin\nMeet in -- in 1991. We -- we do a lot of vienna poldi, fill a page for doing \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList.\u201d The council is very important, we are involved with the money to distribute for the\nneedy survivors.",

        "Answer: My name is Marsha Loen, Marsh Supporzhnikov Loen. My maiden name was\nSupporzhnikov. I was born in Lithuania, Kolnos. In fact, the outskirts of Kolnos,\nLabotkia. And I was born in 1930, July 28.",
        "A: I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little\ncamps out of Stutthof were concentrated. And the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you\nthe honest truth, I don\u2019t remember when I was liberated. I thought they were burning\ndown the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead\naround me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian\u2019s doctor taking care of\nme. I had the two typhuses. And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on\nit, and I looked like musselwoman. And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize\nanything. And after three days, or a week, I don\u2019t know exactly, they told us we have to\nleave that village, because the front 1s coming on. So we should walk to Lomborg.\nLomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from Chinno. And as we were walking, I with\na little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will\nnever forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to\ntake us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we --\nthey shouldn\u2019t notice that we have typhus. And they said, \u201cNo, we cannot do it, because\nwe are not allowed to.\u201d But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us\nbehind, in that little carriage, but they said, \u201cThe first house in Lomborg, you have to get\nout.\u201d So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out. So, we\nwent out, and the first house we walked in. And all I can remember is everything was\nempty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don\u2019t know, at that time I\ndidn\u2019t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. And in the middle was\nstanding a bottle, with blueberries. And I didn\u2019t know it was preserve, or something.\nThere was no water in that house, nothing. And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we\nhad a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. And sh -- she said, \u201cShall\nwe drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cI am afraid it may be poisoned.\u201d Left poison, there\u2019s that bottle\nstanding there, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s nothing. And then we couldn\u2019t stand it any more,\nand what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so\nyoung, I didn\u2019t know nothing. Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we\nfelt so much better, that it was fermemented. It was set up for wine, or something, and it\nhelped the temperature. And our temperature dropped. We s -- we went around, and we\nlooked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized\nsome people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two\nweeks, three weeks, they\u2019re grown up people. And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for\nthem, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the\nwomen. German, Jewish, it didn\u2019t matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So\nwhat they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where\nthey lived, six women. And if you put a sign up that it\u2019s typhus, the Russians didn\u2019t care,\nthey just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. And what happened\nis -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave\nme a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light,\nand the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was\ntyphus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick\nwith the salve on my head. They start running. And this is how I saved six women from\nbeing raped by the Russians. Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going\ndown the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn\u2019t that\nmuch water, and anything, and I thought I\u2019Il wash out my -- whatever I have, in that\npond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me,\nand I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.\nHe said, \u201cAteeja dofka.\u201d I mean, am -- am I Jewish. And I said yes. He said, \u201cI am too,\nfrom Odessa, don\u2019t get scared.\u201d So I took him up into the apartment where the girls were.\nThey saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d\nYou know, they dragged me back in the other room. And it so happened that it -- he was\nthere for two weeks. He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. He gave me even a\nwedding band. And I wasn\u2019t even 15 years old yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to\nme he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la --\nhis father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought\nto myself, \u201cLet him talk.\u201d But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two\nweeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in. And when he\nleft, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. So we slept there, so\nnobody could touch us there either. And one day a man came up to me, and he said,\n\u201c\u201cAkeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?\u201d Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma --\nMarioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. \u201cMy son wrote a letter at home that you are\nhere in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital. I would\nlike to send you to Odessa. He wants to marry you.\u201d And I told him, I said, \u201cI cannot do\nit. | have to go back home first. I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have\nanything,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cDo you love my son?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know him well enough.\nI don\u2019t know what love 1s.\u201d Is -- I -- he didn\u2019t know my age, he didn\u2019t know nothing.\nNobody know nothing about anybody. And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age,\nbecause my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. And I -- so even\nafter I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age. So, even to that man that was the fa --\nand I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said,\n\u201cTell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your\nson 1s, and you\u2019re not even Jewish?\u201d Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name\nwas, I don\u2019t even remember, and he says, \u201cYou see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and\ndoctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans,\nthat the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn\u2019t give us out that we are Jews on top of it.\u201d\nSo this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn\u2019t the only one that suffered, and there were\nother people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my\nmind. And we felt better, and we didn\u2019t know there was [indecipherable] existed. We\ndidn\u2019t know about people not going back home or nothing. All I want is to go home, and\nsee what\u2019s happened.",
        "A: My two little sister, my mother, was taken away in Stutthof. I didn\u2019t know if they are -\n- were dead, or alive, or nothing. I had a feeling that they were killed there. All taken to\nTheresienstadt. Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to\nAuschwitz. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I can only tell you I lost them, about\nmaybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But the only thing that bothered me 1s that they\nwere taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they\nwere taken away. And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is\nall in my other tape. And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my\nfather was in Dachau. I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and --\nand this -- I knew they were dead. My other family -- certain family members were all\ndead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno\nghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. But the\nthing is 1s, 1s -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home. So they said yes,\nthey\u2019 ll s -- they\u2019Il s -- put us on trains, and they\u2019Il send us home. So they put us on big\ntrucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don\u2019t know how to say it in English, a\nranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not\nfar from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on. And they took us there, and there\nwere some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. And the\nJewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to\nclean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. They\ndidn\u2019t give us enough food, the Russians. They didn\u2019t kill us, they didn\u2019t beat us, but\nthere was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with\nguards, like in the [indecipherable]. The only difference was that we weren\u2019t beaten up,\nwe weren\u2019t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. There were about maybe\n10 Jewish girls. And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would\nlike to go to learn with veterinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach\nveterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields\nthat were running wild. And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese\nfactory. And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they\u2019re\nhealthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came\nback. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if\nthey needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent\nto s -- Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little\nsisters, and the rest of my family. So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, \u201cI am going to\nRigenwald.\u201d We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, 1t must have\nbeen from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl,\nand two Jewish girls. And what happened is is that -- what\u2019s so amazing is that the doctor\nwas a drunk. He was compl -- always drunk. And we learned some. We learned how to\nprotect when a cow 1s slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs.\nWe learned how to take analysis from a horse\u2019s neck. We learned ho -- if they got this\neye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. We learned the cows, they had a certain thing\non their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? It\u2019s a certain\nchemical. Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical. So get away the sickness\nshouldn\u2019t spread. We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most\nimportant thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife, with the\nmain man\u2019s wife. I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before. She\nwent in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others. I -- I told her that\u2019s not\nproper. I told her your hair doesn\u2019t look, let me comb it for you. We got to be the best of\nfriends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife. And they treated me like a daughter the two\nweeks I was -- three weeks we were there. After three weeks we got a paper with a\npitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. Akivia trinarn inyarz. I\nwas a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We came into that village again, we worked.\nWe worked with the horses, we worked this. Two weeks later, after we came back from\nRigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that trench. There\nwas a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. And he\nsaid, \u201cAkdere Marouska?\u201d Where is marsh -- Marouska. And the captain said, \u201cIn her\nroom with the other Jewish girl.\u201d He says, \u201cIn her room? You mean to tell me she doesn\u2019t\nhave an apartment of her own?\u201d And his wife got very mad. He said, \u201cI want to call her\nimmediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.\u201d Because there was dinner in the\ncaptain\u2019s house. It\u2019s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house. So\nwhen he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I\nhave to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory. I have\nto be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything\nprepared, and -- now, don\u2019t forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel\n15. And what happened is 1s before I left for the other -- good for the other ranch, big\nranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the\nstalls. But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have\nkilled me, the Russian girls. So what happened 1s is when I went to that good, I arrived,\nand I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night\nthe Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked 1n, the ranch, from all\nthe ranches they would come, and -- and Polish soldiers they would come, and I would\ngive them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russian soldiers weren\u2019t fed either. They would\ncut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with\npotatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. Everything was shipped to Russia.\nAnd what happened 1s 1s that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the\nPolish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring\nliquor and so on. But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the\nwoman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman. That\u2019s the first time I ate\nwatfles in my life, because she had the stove that she moved waffles around. She was\nfrom Pullman. She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me. So the\nminute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and\nnobody could get near me. But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age\nwouldn\u2019t do. I was boar hunting, believe it or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians,\nwith the Polish officers. I -- I did everything I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride\nout, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron\nwomen, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean\nin the fields and so on.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It just came natural to me. It just came natural to me. In the beginning I\nwas very ver -- I said I was going to take revenge. In the beginning I was riding my\nhorse, I would see children on the street, I didn\u2019t care, I was ride -- dust, the dirt and\neverything. But then about a month later, I was taking them medicine, and food, I was\nstealing from the Russians, and giving to the poor German kids.",
        "A: This is a Jewish heart. We\u2019re a very compassionate people.",
        "A: Not very long -- didn\u2019t take me very long to build up, to feel sorry for those kids, and\ntake them food, and take them medicine, and steal from the Russians. And one day the\ncaptain came to me, and that -- this is a really funny story. He came to me to my village.\nAnd he says, you know there was a befell -- was like when there\u2019s a order that the -- the\nRussians can take nothing away animal from the Germans. Absolutely nothing, no cows,\nno horses, nothing. And the eye sickness of the horses, I forgot how it was called. I was\nnever a veterinarian, so I forgot it. Broke out and we lost seven horses, and they put --\nPolkovnik was coming, and he said, \u201cYour village is full of horses.\u201d He\u2019s talking to a\ngrown up person, you know. \u201cI need seven horses.\u201d I said, \u201cFine, Ill give you seven\nhorses. You release seven see -- seven girls from the -- that you\u2019re holding. If you put\nthem on the train, I\u2019Il give you seven.\u201d Said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that many, but Pll release some.\u201d\nI said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So how do I do it? I have to have a plan. So I sat down, and I talked to the\nGerman woman that took care of me, and I made myself a plan. I am -- I got a lot of\nfantastic liquor from those majors that came, from the -- the pilots from Stettlin. And I\ninvited seven officers from the Polish camp. And we got them so drunk that they were\nflat on the floor. We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers.\nWe put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went\nout, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped\nthem on a cart, and took them back to their camp. The next thing the rumor was in the\nvillage that the Polish army stole seven horses. Now I had something over that captain.\nHe was so afraid of me that you have no idea. Because God forbid he should go to the\nhigher ups, and everything. So everything I wanted, I got. So when the soldiers from each\ncamp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If\nthey wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and\nhe was afraid of me as hell. One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I\u2019Il never\nforget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, \u201cAre y -- do you\nknow anybody by the name of Myashka Supporzhnikov?\u201d And I said to him like that. I\nput my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, \u201cOh please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d And the\nRussian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, \u201cMarouska, don\u2019t\nworry. Anything you want I\u2019ll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some\nmedicine when I was sick. You brought food for me. I will help you with anything I can.\u201d\nA very, very lo -- I couldn\u2019t say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with\nintelligent you have to be born. Very average person, you know? And I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand why he does it. And he said, you know what? So I tell him the story, that I\nfound out from that man that my father is alive in Lodz, in Poland, and he came to pick\nme up. So he said to me, \u201cNot only will I take you -- let you go, but I\u2019Il take you to the\ntrain.\u201d And I want to tell you something. When we came into the villages, the houses\nwere empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras. With everything\nwas in my apartment, when I was riding on that horse, I didn\u2019t even have a sweater on.\nI'll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on. I remember now, I didn\u2019t remember\nbefore, riding boots, and -- and they\u2019re real good boots, because one of the officer, police\nofficer, brought it to me, and riding pants. That\u2019s all I had with me, because I was going\nwith him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going. And I\nsaid, \u201cOkay. You are taking me to the train, but I\u2019m going to give you a letter. And when\nthe captain does something to you, you tell him, \u2018I have a letter from Maroushka about\nthe seven horses.\u2019 \u201d I said, \u201cAt least I can do for you that you don\u2019t get punished, or put\nin jail, or anything like that.\u201d So what I did 1s I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat\ndown, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He took us to the train. And that man says to\nme, \u201cNow remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I\nwant you to be like you\u2019re -- you don\u2019t know how to speak, you don\u2019t know how to --\nyou\u2019re -- you\u2019re dumb. Whatever anybody says, you just move your head.\u201d Because at\nthat time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially\non trains, and so on. And I listened to him, and he might -- I don\u2019t even [indecipherable] I\nwas freezing a little bit. And I went to -- we went with the train and we arrived in Lodz.",
        "A: That was still in 1945, the end of 1945. I think it was the end of 1940 -- yes, the end of\n1945. And I arrived in Lodz, and that\u2019s in Poland, and I met my father, and I met a lot of\npeople from my town that were left ali -- not a lot, because you know, people that were\nleft over, and of course, my father couldn\u2019t tell me something that I couldn\u2019t do. I was\nsmoking, and he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t smoke.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you mean to tell me I\ncan\u2019t smoke? I can smoke, I can do whatever I want to.\u201d If I thought to myself, maybe at\nthat time -- I don\u2019t know if I thought to myself this way, if I can handle a Po-Polkovnik\n[indecipherable] I can handle my father, you know. If he tells me not to smoke, it\u2019s none\nof his business if I smoke or I don\u2019t smoke. And at that time my father was a tailor, a very\ngood tailor. That what saved our life also in the Kovno ghetto. And he start work. He\nworked in -- in Lodz as a tailor, and he helped a lot of people from Lithuania, from\nKovno that went through Lodz. He had a big apartment, and in -- the one -- that\napartment, downstairs was a big room. I don\u2019t -- it was like a hole. And anybody that\nwent through, went through my fa -- they said, \u201cGo to Beryl Supporzhnikov.\u201d And they\nwent through, and everybody knew him, because he was a very good looking man from\nKovno, very well dressed, and always the best. And th-they came, and he would give\nthem food, and he wouldn\u2019t let them go back to Lithuania, because he found out that it\u2019s\nnot good there. You know, I found out later on that I have an older sister in Lithuania.\nThis 1s how he found out that I am in that camp, from her. Somehow she found out from\nsomebody that I am alive in that camp. Maybe somebody that escaped. And she let my\nfather know it. People smuggled in things. So he know what was going on. The people\nare trying to go out of Lithuania. So anybody that went through that wanted to go back to\nKovno, to Lithuania, he wouldn\u2019t let them. He kept them there, he kept them till the\nkibbutz took them, and took them over to Bratislava, and then to displaced camps.\nBecause at that time Lodz wasn\u2019t yet Communistic as much, and --",
        "A: Can we stop --",
        "A: -- at the end there?",
        "A: Ihave to go to the bathroom.",
        "A: So [arrived in Lodz, and my father, and everybody, we were partying, and of course I\nwas smoking, like I said, and my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t smoke,\u201d and I said, \u201cYes I can.\u201d\nAnd anyway, he did not have a big control over me, that I have to say. And it was very\nsad. And for one reason my father didn\u2019t have a big control over me, and I hate to say it,\nmy father was a very selfish man, and I remembered him from ghetto, what he did to us.\nAnd I really -- I loved my father, but I didn\u2019t like him. I\u2019m sorry to say this, should rest in\npeace. And what happened is is that in Lodz he says to me -- he -- he knew that my\nmother is dead, and he got himself a girlfriend, a friend of my mothers, that she lost her\nhusband and two kids, also in the Kovno ghetto. And what happened is is that he says to\nme, \u201cI have enough money to smuggle the border.\u2019\u2019 Now he-here he helps all the\nstrangers, and his only leftover child, he says, \u201cI have enough money to smuggle the\nborder for me and Rocholla. I don\u2019t have enough money for you.\u201d So what do I do? I\nwent into the kibbutz, in -- to work in the hospital because I know how to give a\ninjection, you know, I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp, by working with the\nanimals, it\u2019s not that different to give a injection, and take a temperature, and so on. So I\nwent into the kibbutz, and I stayed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in Lodz -- and I\nworked in the hospital, and in Madrid the head of the kibbutz came to me, and he says,\n\u201cMarsha,\u201d -- now, nobody knew my age. I -- I looked so much older than I am, thanks\nGod, that why I was alive -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s thanks God or not. And he says to me,\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d he says, \u201cyou want to go -- get over on the other side?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, I\nwant to get away from L\u00e9dz,\u201d because I was engaged to a man that was 34 years old, and\nI was not -- I was 15. He gave a diamond watch to a friend of my fathers, to introduce us.\nAnd he was so jealous when I went away on business or something in Lodz, and when he\ncame back and I wasn\u2019t home, he was running all over, looking for me. And I had already\nmy wedding dress, because he impressed me so tremendously. You know, coming out of\nthe concentration camps, coming out of that place, that Russian camp, and everything,\nand he brought me presents, and -- and he took me to places, but I could not speak\nJewish, and I could not speak any other language with him. So he said, \u201cI will do the\nspeaking, you keep quiet, Marouska.\u201d And that -- that was it. So he impressed me with all\nthe diamonds, and all the sweaters, and -- and he was a very, very rich man.",
        "A: He was a Jewish -- a Polish Jew.",
        "A: He want to spea -- he couldn\u2019t speak, because the Akar are killing people in Lodz, in\nthe bus stops, everywhere you went. Not many people could go to a movie in 1940s --\nend of 1945, beginning of 1946. They couldn\u2019t go to a movie. They couldn\u2019t walk the\nstreets and speak Yiddish. Absolutely not, Jewish. So what happened is is he impressed\nme with all those things, and I was going to marry him. Then -- and then I realized it, oh\nmy gosh, I can\u2019t marry that man, that man 1s -- could -- is older -- practically as old as my\nfather, he is jealous, I don\u2019t have no friends, I can\u2019t make any friends. Now this is me\nthinking, a youngster, a teenager. And I said, \u201cI have to get away from him.\u201d So on our\nengagement party at this cousin\u2019s estate in Lodz, I dance with his best friend, a Jew from\nthe Polish army, and I came back to the couch, and he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. So I\nsaid to the friend, \u201cChaim, give me my cape.\u201d And I took my cape, and I went to my\nfather\u2019s house. And I said, \u201cWould you like to go to Bratislav right now,\u201d the next\nmorning? And he was running after me, and he was yelling, and stop, and he came to the\ndoor, and that friend of his left, and I locked the door. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cPack.\u201d And\nI run over -- from the other side, I run over to the kibbutz, and I told that man, I\u2019m taking\n-- that was the next day that that was -- he wanted me to take the transport. Everything --\nyou see, we were trained to take the transport over the border, people that wanted to do it.\nAnd that what -- why I went into the kibbutz. He said to me -- I said to him, \u201cT\u2019ll take that\ntransport. But my father and my stepmother go,\u201d -- I -- I mi -- I called her my stepmother,\nshe wasn\u2019t yet -- \u201cgoes with me.\u201d He says, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s arranged.\u201d Because it so happened\nthat the people that were supposed to take me -- it, the couple don\u2019t feel so hot.",
        "A: Yeah. The ide -- I don\u2019t know. We had to get out of Lodz. Oh, yes, the idea to go to\nPalestine was from the beginning. To go to Palestine, that was my ideal thing. So here we\nare, we\u2019re ready, and everybody, I\u2019m taking 25 people over the border to Bratislav. From\nLodz to Bratislav, the Akar shooting after us. Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother\nRocholla, was with me in the same camp, and I helped her stay behind, because she froze\nher feet up. My feet were frozen, too. They took off her fingers from one foot, in Lodz,\nand she couldn\u2019t walk that fast. They wanted to take some of my toes off, and I wouldn\u2019t\nlet them, because the doctor said there\u2019s a chance that they can heal that. So I went for\ntherapy, and what I did 1s, I washed floors, I did everything to pay the doctor. And the\ndoctor gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it\nlooked like I had a fungus on my foot, but it start healing. And I could walk. And then\nwhen I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz paid part of it. So, in about two and a half\nmonths, my feet were ready to go. And I had those -- they got me orthopedic shoes at the\nkibbutz, and I went. And as we were going, what I wanted to tell you, I run away from\nthat guy -- later on I heard he had a nervous breakdown, I don\u2019t know about that one. But\nI want to tell you the Akar, you couldn\u2019t go to a movie, you couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant if\nyou were Jewish, if you spoke Jewish. They a -- every day they had something happen\nJew in L\u00e9dz. One was shot in a -- in a bus stop, the other one was deesent, it was terrible.\nFor me, it was a terrible thing, because as bad as the Russian was, they never beat us,\nthey never hurt us, they never shot us. So I went and I took that transport. And the Akar\nwas shooting after us. It was in the middle of the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed\ndown, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother. It didn\u2019t take long we arrived\nin Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him,\nand everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so\nhappened that we went through Austria with the train. And they said, \u201cWho would like to\nstay in Austria?\u201d And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that beautiful scenery, and\nlike I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved\nsports. Even as a child, when I was eight years old, I was at the school Olympics, you\nknow. So what happened is is that I was a daredevil. I was a -- like I\u2019m a tomboy when I\nwas a youngster. Because there was a certain branch out from my wer -- my grandfather\nfrom my mother\u2019s side was a very well-to-do man, and I was his angel. It\u2019s supposed to\nbe a boy, but still he called me by a boyish name, Yankela. But I was his life. So what I\nmean is that I -- I -- from the beginning, you know, I wasn\u2019t in public school, I was\nthrown out when I was seven years old. I hit a teacher, accidentally, you know. Not\naccidentally, sh -- a man was putting ink in the back of my head, a boy. And I told her,\nand she said -- and she didn\u2019t like it, because she knows I come from a better family. So\nshe, \u201cYou keep quiet. You sit down.\u201d And it happened four times, I couldn\u2019t stand it any\nmore. And you know the way they sit in Europe, you\u2019re a German, you know. The\nteacher sits in front before you go out the door. So I took my thing that I was writing in,\nmy book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, \u201cI am\nleaving.\u201d And accidentally I hit her nose. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story, I\u2019m not going to\nget into it. I was thrown out of the school, and my grandfather had to pay a lot of money.\nHe would have loved me to go to Hebrew school, but they -- they wouldn\u2019t take me in, so\nI went to komairts gimnasia, it was a Jewish private school. So I\u2019m telling you, I was a\ndaredevil from the beginning. So as we come to that beautiful country Austria, I said,\n\u201cPapa, if you and Rocholla want to go on to Germany, go ahead. I\u2019m staying 1n this\ncountry in. Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up, and\nfrom there we\u2019ll be able to go to Palestine, and so on.",
        "A: That was also the Bricha. But at that time I didn\u2019t know who they were. You\nunderstand what I mean? So I sat on the train, they stopped the train, we went off, and we\nwent toward this place called Verkshide [indecipherable]. It was a horrible place. It was\nwooden barracks. The food was also rationed, but it was good. We were DDT\u2019s, and so\non. So again, I said, why should I take that. So I made friends with the American essing\nofficer that distribute the food, and he had the -- the trucks and so on. I made friends with\nDr. Dimetritus, because I helped him in -- that he was a Greek -- not Jewish, Greek that\nrun the -- the -- the hospital in the displaced camp, and also the head of the displaced\ncamp. So -- and I also worked for the -- for the Itterdude. That\u2019s organization from --\nfrom the first president of -- of Palestine, and -- in the young brigade, goldonia. And I --\nin the displaced camp, in Verkshide, I made friends with them, so oh -- and I was getting\nlooking very good. I was a pretty good looking girl.",
        "A: And I had very good friends, and I -- that essing officer, and everybody, they were just\ndoing everything when I ask, and so on. And there were a lot of ma -- people sent to the\ndisplaced camp from Israel, they were called Sheliaks, to talk to the people how to get\nover to Palestine, and at that time. And I met with them, and I went out with them one\nnight to a night club, that a friend of mine\u2019s mother owned it, Alonstra, it\u2019s in Linz, in\nAustria. And I get a call from the pharmacist, from the -- from the displaced camp. He\nsays, \u201cMarsha, we are going to DDT the camp.\u201d Verkshide. He said, \u201cWould you like to\nhave some fun?\u201d This is how I met my husband, I want to tell you this sto -- that\u2019s why\nI\u2019m telling you this story. I said, \u201cI love to, as long as you don\u2019t touch my barrack, or my\nfather\u2019s.\u201d Said fine. So I came, and they put me in in a white, big, long thing with a mask.\nAnd I am going around, and I am spraying the barracks, and being very gentle about it,\nbecause it\u2019s my people, and everything, and all of a sudden I open a room, and the people\nare sitting, they are all dressed beautiful, drinking wine, having beautiful food and\neverything. And I got so mad that I pulled my mask down, and I start spraying the DDT\nat them. And one of them was my husband, Cornelius. And at that time he saw my eyes,\nhe saw my face, and he said he fall in love with me. He was em -- then they liquidated\nVerkshide, and they send us to a much better displaced camp called Bindermichl. And\nthat was -- Goering\u2019s built some apartment houses. So they put two, three families into\nrooms, a family into a room, and with my father -- I live with my father, I got mad at my\nfather, I walked out on him. I went to live with a girlfriend, it so happened in the same\nplace my husband had a room with another man, and my husband worked for the Joint at\nthat time. Joint Distribution Committee. And I met him, and what happened is I worked\nfor the bri -- for the Itterdude, and I start getting into the Bricha business.",
        "A: I -- I wrote for them, I translated for them in Russian, in Yiddish, in whatever it 1s. I\nworked on the Jewish typewriter, and -- you know, in -- in the same time when we moved\nto Bindermichl, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to school.\u201d To go to school -- I spoke a little bit\nof German, and to go to school you had to be a certain age, but I wanted to -- I want to go\ninto art school. Just go all over, all those things we\u2019re speaking, German, nothing, for me\nthat doesn\u2019t exist. I want to go to art school. To go to art school I had to take a course in\nGerman, and I went into art school, and also worked for the Itterdude at the same time.\nAnd one day they said to me, \u201cMarsha, we are going to take some people over.\u201d And\nwhat happened is voke -- going to -- to school in Austria, I got this Austrian outfit, with\nmy big, black braid, with the Austrian hair, you know, with the feather. And I spoke\nalready the dialect in Austria pretty good. So they said, \u201cWe need you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy do\nyou need me?\u201d They came to the office of the Itterdude. They said, \u201cWe need -- we\nsmuggle people, we\u2019re going to be straight with you. We smuggle people through the\nInnsbruck border,\u201d they say, \u201cinto the Italian, into the middle of the mountain, and there\nthe Italian take over.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready, I\u2019m going.\u201d So I -- and 1t was vacation time, and\nI come in, and they tell me what to do, and I do it. And what happened also 1s that the\nfirst thing that I went into the Austrian school to learn art, I had a friend of mine do me a\nfalse passport. A Austrian false passport, what nobody had. So I can do things that\nnobody else can. The a -- the essing officer moved with us to Bindermichl. And you\nknow to have, I mean, a friendship with that -- with the -- you must heard about it -- I\nknow you\u2019re younger than I am, to have a friendship with a -- with an American soldier,\nyou were like a whore, excuse my expression. But that man was so beautiful. And I said,\n\u201cYou know, I need a truck.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy do you need a truck?\u201d I said, \u201cOh, we want to\ngo to Ebensee skiing,\u201d we want to go there, we want to go there. He said, \u201cOkay, what\nelse do you need?\u201d I said that I need some food provision a little bit and so on. Says,\n\u201cOkay, we going out next week?\u201d I said, \u201cFine, it\u2019s alright with me.\u201d So he gave me the\ntruck, and we took the people to Zanenfeld. That\u2019s near Innsbruck, and there was nothing,\nthere was just some hou -- fenced 1n, like I remember a fenced in place. I had the picture\nof it, a trumpet. I don\u2019t know where I put it, 1t disappeared. And we would call in, and we\nwould -- we took a little package, each one took a little package with them. We went\nthrough that little -- what do you call it?",
        "A: Little pat into the mountain. We took them up the mountain, we went one by one. And\nthen we would leave them there, the Italians would take over, and the two people that\ntook them would come back to the camp, and come to Zanenfeld.",
        "A: Very dangerous, because first place, I was on a false passport. Second place, I am\ncaughting smuggling people over the border. Now that was over the Italian border, you\nunderstand what I mean? They didn\u2019t know what I was smuggling there. I could say \u2019m\nsmuggling to it -- Italy, you know. And -- but it was dangerous, it was [indecipherable].\nAnd then one time was shooting off [indecipherable] it was dangerous. My father didn\u2019t\nwant me to do it, and I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do, I do what I want to do.\u201d And I\nalready met my husband.",
        "A: That -- I -- he wasn\u2019t that time with me that -- that close, we just knew each other. He\ninvited me to go to a concert, and I wanted to go dancing, and I was invited from the\nAmerican head of the camp to go dancing in the club, in the camp club. And I\n[indecipherable] said, \u201cThat man is crazy. I should go to a concert when I can\u2019t go\ndancing?\u201d He said, \u201cA little culture won\u2019t help you -- won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d But I didn\u2019t go\nwith him, but every other day he was waiting near the office, the Itterdude for me. And I\nfinally start going out with him. In the beginning I was mad, it\u2019s a long story, because I\nthought he went out with somebody else, and so on.",
        "A: What I liked about him, you see, I never went out with anybody that didn\u2019t have a\neducation. I never went out with anybody that had dirty nails, or dusty shoes. Never. That\nwas my -- I don\u2019t know why, don\u2019t ask me. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t understand it. And I\nliked him, I wasn\u2019t in love with him yet, but I liked him. And I -- and he brought me\nbeautiful things he bought from the Joint, and there was a lot of beautiful clothes, you\nknow. And I didn\u2019t really need it, because I went out with a guy -- now this 1s I wa -- I\nwas already 16. I went out with a guy that was from the Prague University, and he was\nthe head of the police in the camp, and lived out of the -- outside of the camp. And he\nthought I was going to marry him. And that -- one day he got very sick. I had a fi -- I fou\n-- another thing is, it\u2019s very interesting, this 1s old camp, and this is old displaced camp. I\nmade friends with the CIC from England, a woman, and she was very in love with that\nguy Tommy, that man that I am telling you about. And she went home one day and she\nbrought me a poodle, and for herself a big boxer. And the boxer in the compartment, in\nthe plane, bit a piece of the poodle\u2019s foot. So Dr. Dimitri, the doctor, fixed the f -- the --\nthe -- the poodle\u2019s foot. And I left him with Tommy, of course in Tommy\u2019s house, and I\ncalled him Tommy, because Tommy had some stomach trouble. He was a Jew from the\nUniversity of Prague, and I called him Tommy. So I left him, and one day, one evening I\nwent home, and I came home the next morning, and I want to go into his apartment, and\nhis valet doesn\u2019t let me in. And I said, \u201cWhy, what\u2019s going on? I have to go in, I forgot\nsomething.\u201d Anyway, I had a lit -- bitty little fight with him, I went into the room, and my\ngirls from the redhaired was sti -- the two dogs were lying next to the bed, and my\ngirlfriend\u2019s from the CIC, re -- the redhead was sticking out of the bed. He starts running\nafter me, and -- and begging me, and everything, and I said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with you.\u201d Anyway, I come to my father. He said, \u201cDo you sleep with\nhim?\u201d My father was very outspoken with me. I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, a man\nneeds it, and they need to get it somewhere. So he has your girlfriend handy, so he did it.\nI don\u2019t like Tommy, I don\u2019t want him to go out with you.\u201d I said, \u201cYou have nothing to\nsay, Papa.\u201d I said, \u201cI do what I want, but I don\u2019t want to go back with him, I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with him.\u201d So one day I was out with the shleeoch dancing, and I get again\na call. Tommy is very sick, he won\u2019t take any medicine, nothing. This was already\nBindermichl. He won\u2019t take any medicine, nothing, till you come to see him. So I said to\nhim, \u201cChaim, would you go with me?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, to save a person\u2019s life.\u201d So I went\nwith him, and he took the medicine, and he got better, and I had to promise him, I said,\n\u201cLook, my father doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d right away I used my father. I don\u2019t even live with\nhim, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want -- like you, doesn\u2019t want me to marry m -- y -- me. Why don\u2019t you go\nto Italy with the transport, and I\u2019ll meet you there afterwards?\u201d In the meanwhile, it\u2019s a\nlong story, I met Cornelius. I thought I fall in love with him, and I thought to myself --\nand he asked me to marry him. And he said, \u201cIt would be a good time. My two friends,\nmy best two friends are coming back from Italy,\u201d they left to go to buna -- San Paolo, or\nBuenos Aires, I don\u2019t know where it was. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back, could we get married?\u201d\nAnd we got ma -- we were get -- we got married, and Barbie, she should [indecipherable]\nwent back to Italy, and accidentally they met Tommy. And Tommy said, \u201cOh, you come\nfrom Bindermichl, my fianc\u00e9e is coming.\u201d And he took out that picture, and this woman\ndidn\u2019t mean that it was that it was that serious. So she says -- Barbie, she says, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, your fianc\u00e9e just married our best friend.\u201d But before that I went with the opera\nsinger from Romania. I went with the guy that went -- also from Romania, that went with\nthe King sisters. And one woman was very jealous, and she said to my father, \u201cHow can\nyou let her go out so much, with so many men?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s better too many men than\njust one. So I\u2019m sure nothing will happen.\u201d And my father didn\u2019t have anything to say\nabout who I'll go out or what I do anyway. But he liked Cornelius, I don\u2019t know why.\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know, Papa, he is half Jewish, he is not even Jewish.\u201d He says, \u201cYou\nwill make something, I know you, you\u2019ll make him Jewish. Don\u2019t -- \u2019'm not worried\nabout it.\u201d\u201d And he gave him -- I\u2019Il never forget -- my husband hates fish. And he gave\nhim, he said, \u201cWould you like a drink with a piece of herring?\u201d Of course, Cornelius was\na gentleman. You know, he was so debonair, I think that what impressed me, he wore that\nhat with the pipe, you know, he was very well dressed, I\u2019Il show you pictures. And that\nwhat impressed me so much about him. And I brought him uppa -- and we were in the\nroom eating, and the father gives him a piece of herring, was a gentleman, he start eating\nthat herring, and he chewed and he chewed, and he chewed. And I said, \u201cPapa, go out and\nhelp Rocholla in the kitchen.\u201d And we were on the second floor, and I said, \u201cCornelius,\nspit it out right away,\u201d you know. And then when I speak German, because the only\nlanguage that we can communicate, and what Cornelius did a lot for me, is that he helped\nme go to school, and then in Windham, there were the big bed, and then I was e -- and we\nwere married already, and a friend of ours was lying on the other side, and we were -- I\nwas doing my homework. I was also at the theater in Austria, and the -- in the\nkammershpeeler. But Cornelius made my father, and he made me quit it, because they\nsaw -- there was a play -- I -- I don\u2019t have very perfect legs, so I always had to wear long\nclothes. So I played the maid in the kammershpeel -- you know how beautiful the\nkammershpeeler varm, with the chandelier, and everything. I played a maid the harem\nhouse. How do you Say it? It was a -- a film made, and also a movie, segments of it in\nEnglish. The harem house, you know, with the maid, where the father says tyrin down, do\neverything, this and this and that, and he was there.",
        "A: The head of the house, I forgot what the thing was. And I played that in the\nkammershpeeler. Then Cornelius saw the leading lady walking around in a bra, from one\nroom to the other. And he said to my father, he said, \u201cBerrik, do you like that?\u201d My father\nsaid, \u201cNo, but I have no control over her, maybe you can do something.\u201d So they did\nsomething, and that was the end of my theater career -- career. Anyway, what I want to\ntell you, I went to art school, and I learned how to -- to design clothes. What can you do\nin that little time? But I had it in me from my father, that\u2019s one thing you -- he was one of\nthe best tailors. And my dress won first prize, and I\u2019ll never forget it. It was a royal blue\ndress that I designed. Was with the high neck, royal blue like a crepe suz -- a crepe\nmaterial that\u2019s silk. And it had a big Japanese pocket I put on it. I must have seen it\nsomewhere or something. And then the belt went in, right into the pocket, and it tied. And\nthen I put on the model big, red jewelry on the royal blue, with big, red earring, and\nbeautiful black marble. It won first prize. So that was it.",
        "A: And when I got married -- yeah, go ahead.",
        "A: We\u2019re roughly on the end of 1946, as I was going already, with Cornelius.",
        "A: Okay, let\u2019s --",
        "A: -- can we -- can I go to the bathroom?\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Okay. Just go ahead, Regina.",
        "A: Absolutely not, and I\u20191l tell you why. Can I tell you why?",
        "A: I\u2019m even driving a German car, because you cannot go on hating all your life, you\nonly hurt yourself. And that is what I learned here in school, when I took a couple of\nsemesters from psychology, after I finished high school, and junior -- college. Because --",
        "A: -- Ime -- I don\u2019t say I\u2019m in love with the people that -- that -- the offspring that the\npeople that did it to me, but I cannot also hate, because I\u2019m only going to hurt myself.\nAnd language is a culture, and the German is a very good car, because I get a very good\ntrade-in on it. So that\u2019s the answer for you, Regina.",
        "A: It bothered me to a certain extent that I don\u2019t feel nothing. It did bother me, but I\ndidn\u2019t feel anything about it. I\u2019m sorry to say that, maybe it\u2019s wrong. But, you know, to\nhate is to hurt yourself, and that I\u2019ve learned from the beginning as I was liberated, with\nthe Russians, with everything else. If you hate, you only hurt yourself. Without even\ngoing to school, I knew about it. I felt about it, let\u2019s say, this way.",
        "A: No. Not till after eight years, or seven years I was in this country. I didn\u2019t even know\nsurvivor exist for about seven years in this country. That is another story.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they we\u2019ll finish this soon.",
        "A: Shall I tell you something? First place, Cornelius was a different survivor that I was.\nHe had a Christian mother that was a Righteous Christian that impressed me\ntremendously. She saved 32 Jews. In fact, she has right now a tree in Jerusalem. And\nshe\u2019s in one of our guides in the museum as a Righteous Christian, in the same guide that\nSchindler is, and Wallenberg. Second place, he was a gentleman. Third place, he came\nfrom Yugoslavia, where the lot of his family was killed, too, in Novosad. And third place,\nhe was a good looking man, he was well dressed, and he was clean. And that was the\nmost important thing to me. I don\u2019t care if he would have been -- I don\u2019t know what. And\nthe language that we spoke and could understand each other was only German, because\nhe doesn\u2019t speak Yiddish -- Jewish. I didn\u2019t speak Hungarian, or Yugoslavian, or any\nother language, or English. He spoke 12 languages, I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t that bright. I was\nbright, but not that bright. So, it didn\u2019t bother me at all.",
        "A: Definitely not. Before I met Cornelius, I was the biggest Zionist that ever existed.\nSmuggling the people over the border to Palestine. In fact, Ben-Gurion\u2019s what was his\nname, Shorette was at my wedding, and I was crying, because I had to go to America,\nbecause Cornelius\u2019 family was here. And he said, \u201cMarsha, we need people like you in\nAmerica, too. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d So it was a sadness to a certain extent, a sadness in me that I\ncouldn\u2019t go to Palestine. But another thing I went to a country that I thought I would\nnever got -- get to. You understand what I -- in a way it was selfish, but I was happy.",
        "A: What happened? How did I get to America?",
        "A: Yeah. I married Cornelius, Cornelius had a brother here that came in 1939 for the\nWorld Fair, on his honeymoon. Lost all our money. In fact, when I married Cornelius he\nwas very rich, because I also went for rich people, because I didn\u2019t want to have no food\nagain. And then we got a letter that in 1947, when we got married, his mother and father\nwere supposed to go through Vienna. And I had a false passport, and he had a passport,\nand we were supposed to meet them in Vienna, and then the thing was changed, and they\nwent through Prague, they went by plane. They shipped a lot of antiques, that my father-\nin-law was going to open an antique shop. I don\u2019t want to go into a big story about it,\neverything was stolen, and we couldn\u2019t rip -- we were making 30 dollars a week, and paid\na private detective all over. Nothing was found except a couple of paintings that were\nbetween the bedding that came in those empty cases. So this is the first time I lost money,\nand I didn\u2019t feel sorry for me. I felt sorry for my mother-in-law, and father-in-law that\nhad an estate with maids and chauffer, and two cars in Europe, you know what it means.\nA Fiat, and a Chevrolet for the boys. And ift -- went to San Marco when David -- when\nConnor was three years old, and all over Switzerland, and Cornelius went to -- to college\nin Budapest, and to Switzerland, and -- very, very rich people. And she had to come and\nstart crocheting, and start work. I felt rather sorry for them than for myself.",
        "A: So we came, and we went from Bindermichl, we went to Bremerhaven, and there\u2019s\ndecided there is a boat going through New Orleans, if you -- and it would take 14 days\nrather than more. And we went on that boat. Then that was after -- we were married in\n47, that was in August 1949. And we went on the boat, and being that Cornelius spoke\nso many languages, he was invited as a interpreter to speak over the tape recorder, and we\ncame on the boat early. Came in on the boat early, I was made shtudmarder -- the head of\nthat old woman, barra -- because the women and the men slept separate. And I met the\ntwo Ire officers. And like I said, I was pretty good looking, had a good sense of humor,\nknew how to dance, I won a couple of contested. And that rock and roll in Austria. Not\nwith Cornelius, he\u2019s a lousy dancer, with his friend. And being in the theater, you know,\nand everything. And I made very good friends with the Ire officer. And I got very sick\ngoing through the channel, very sick. And, you know, being that Cornelius was with the\nJoint, and part director of the Joint Distribution Committee, I got an apartment in the\ndisplaced camp that they had a telephone. And through that I met a lot of black\nmarketeers. Ve -- he never did it, because he was afraid, God forbid, he couldn\u2019t go to\nAmerica. So even when he lost all his money, he wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, did\nmy tuxedo arrive? She s -- she wrote him back, \u201cCornelius, with all the money that you\nhave now, you don\u2019t need a tuxedo.\u201d The first thing didn\u2019t bother him, the money, or the\ndiamonds, or everything else, it bothered him is the tuxedo. So what happened 1s is that\nwhen we lived there, and we had that telephone, a lot of black marketeers would come\nover and make telephone calls, and everything else. And they went to England, and they\nbrought me beautiful clothes, you know, as [indecipherable]. But I had a maid from\nDabotchka, Maria, I\u2019ll never forget. And they would come in, and if I wasn\u2019t at home,\nand they would go into the kitchen in the displaced camp, I had a beautiful apartment --\nWiesenthal, from the -- from the Museum of Tolerance, lived above me. I gave him a\nparty line, and I gave him a maid. And I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with that man if he\nsaid boo.",
        "A: Because he\u2019s the biggest phony in the world. I\u2019m sorry to say that on tape. Anyway --\nand if you want to cut it out, you\u2019re welcome to it.",
        "A: Anyway, and the thing is 1s that that will come later, with the museum. And the thing\nis is that I had a telephone, I had all those clothes, we were on the boat, and I didn\u2019t know\nwhere Connor is, Cornelius didn\u2019t know where I -- all of a sudden I didn\u2019t know if I was\nin love with him, if I was not in love with him. And I start throwing up. And that Ire\nofficer was already a little bit in love with me, I had a feeling. So he came down to the\nthing, and he picked me up -- at that time I was only a size seven. I wasn\u2019t what I was\nright n -- he picked me up, in that pink robe [indecipherable] and he gave me his cabin,\nand he went to live with the other Ire officer. And my husband, when I saw him on the\ndeck, I got -- I got well after I saw him. And my husband stayed with me in that -- in that\ncabin, and everybody, all of those survivors that were on that boat, thought that I had an\naffair with the tyrit officer. At my age, just married, you know, and everything else. But I\nlet them talk. And my husband was with me, and we had that cabin over, and we were 14\ndays on the sea. And I got better, and I went out to mingle with the people, and I arranged\na dance on the boat. And, you know, 14 days over the Mississippi, in order to go to New\nOrleans, was a long time. And varabul Connor start feeling better, I start feeling better. I\nhad nice clothes, and I had that friend, that Ire officer. In fact, he came to Los Angeles\none time, when I was very unhappy, because he left me a PO box, in case I\u2019m not happy,\nto send him a letter. And I was unhappy because in the beginning we lived with our 1n-\nlaws, and so on. So I was a little unhappy, till I got that letter, and he came over, and he\nsaid, \u201cAll you do, move out or I take Marsha with me.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, t -- I had a protector, and a friend. And he -- he di -- he was in love with me,\nmaybe, I don\u2019t know. But I did not have an affair with him. I\u2019m telling you, on tape, or on\nthe tape, or off a tape. But everybody thought I did. And we went 14 days\n[indecipherable]. And we arrived to New Orleans, and of course, if we arrived in New\nOrleans -- Cornelius was still the gentleman, and he still knew a little more like all\ndisplaced people, because he was -- and he beat the champion in Ping Pong.",
        "A: No, in New Orleans.",
        "A: In New Orleans. We were in the Jewish -- the Jewish geminda vizakmindas in -- 1n --\nin -- in --",
        "A: No, the gemine, the Jewish farbaltung. The -- the Jews that took care of the people.\nWe were the first boat to arrive in New Orleans. I was so stupid, I took my pearls, and\nrings, and things, and I was afraid to take it with me at the displaced camp, send it with --\nsomebody smuggled -- brought it to my -- to my mother-in-law before 1947, before they\nleft, and -- and theirs were -- everything was stolen, including my things. When I came\ninto New Orleans, they didn\u2019t even look at it, they were so happy to see us, the first boat,\nyou know. And we were staying with all the Jews, it was like a temple, you know, like\nthe Jewish Federation here. You know, there was arranged a -- a big room with food, and\nthe bananas and everything. Because on the boat all I got -- I was invited once to the\ncaptain\u2019s table, and they ask me what would I like. I said, \u201cI would like a piece of black\nbread. I can\u2019t stand that cotton any more.\u201d And then they gave me a bowl of cottage\ncheese and fruit, and I said, \u201cWould you do me a favor, would you separate the fruit and\nthe cottage cheese?\u201d You know, with me there was no nothing, captain or no captain, if I\nhad to say something, I said it. And I start helping the people on the boat. You know,\nthere was a little boy -- she died, and he\u2019s sick, and now he\u2019s a very famous pharmacist,\nand he\u2019s very well to -- I haven\u2019t seen him for maybe 20 years. His name was Leon\nLolinka was his name, and he -- his father was from my town, and I knew his mother.\nAnd I brought food for him, I had food brought for him, and juices that was brought to\nmy cabin and everything. And we arrived in New Orleans like I said, and we were in that\ngeminda. My husband right away played Ping Pong, you know, his life, cause that what\nthey did also in the displaced camp with his cousin, played chess, played Ping Pong. He\nbeat the champion, and a Jewish woman that was -- owned a couple of apartment houses,\nwas very impressed with us, the way we were dressed, than the other people, and my\nhusband beating the champion and every -- she invited .us for dinner, and as we were\nwalking, I had my camera, and I stopped, and I wanted to take a picture of a little black\ngirl in a yellow dress. She was the most gorgeous, beautiful African-American I\u2019ve ever -\n- African-Americ -- at that time we called them black -- African-American girl I\u2019ve ever\nseen, and she came to me, and she said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do those things here.\u201d I said, \u201cI just\nfinished being in a concentration camp, in a displaced camp, in a Russian camp, and\nyou\u2019re coming to tell me that I cannot take a picture of that woman because she has a\ndifferent color skin? Forget your dinner, I\u2019m not coming, invite somebody else.\u201d And I\nwalked away from her. And that rich woman, that I could have had a lot out of her,\nbelieve me, but I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her. Absolutely nothing. She\napologized, and she said, \u201cThis is the rules,\u201d you know, \u201cand I\u2019m Jewish too.\u201d You know,\nand I said, \u201cNo, to me you are not Jewish, because if you would have been Jewish you\nwould have done something about me, and about my two little sisters, and you wouldn\u2019t\nlet me -- tell me that I can\u2019t take a picture of that woman. It was the end of it.",
        "A: Oh, in New Orleans they were -- not that interested, they were just trying to be nice to\nus. Interested nobody was. Nobody wanted to hear the sad stories, and at that time I really\nwasn\u2019t read to tell them yet, to tell you the honest truth, as I arrived. And the -- like I said,\nwe arrived, and I to -- my mother lived in a -- mother-in-law lived in a big house, she was\nliving in a shack. It was a better neighborhood than Bull Heights, and she was working\nalready. And, you know, there was no money. My brother-in-law was broke. My father-\nin-law send him money for the boys, and when everybody went into airplanes, he we --\nhe went into lawnmowers. They didn\u2019t take him in the army because he had something\nwith his eyes, and he lost that money, and his money, and his wife\u2019s money, and\neverybody else, and we were completely broke.",
        "A: In Los Angel -- everything that -- no, in New Orleans we were there a couple of days,\nand then we took a train direct to Los Angeles. And the 70 dollars that he laid out for us, I\npaid him back, because I didn\u2019t want nothing from nobody. And we live with my mother-\nin-law and father-in-law like I said, and they -- Connor was the youngest one, and I start\nworking in a factory. We had to live, we had to eat. I start work in a factory, and what\nhappened is is the foreman wan -- was on vacation -- like I say, I was very handy going --\nworking already on clothes, and everything. And the man that owned the place, his name\nwas Rubin, I will also never forget, he came and he said to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give out\nthe work? Why don\u2019t you act as the foreman?\u201d Worked there couple of days, and every\nnight I came home I was throwing up, and Connor couldn\u2019t get a job. So we went to the\nJewish Federation, that I work now for, at that time, because we came with the affidavit,\nso we got nothing from HIAS, nothing from nobody. So we had to do it -- everything\nourself. So we went there, and they gave him a job as a -- a watchman in a motel -- the\n[indecipherable] the motel is still standing. That man didn\u2019t ever know what a gun means,\nor anything at all the gun. And then my father-in-law would bring the papers and read it\nfor me, because I wasn\u2019t that good in English that time, how many people were killed in\nmotels, with guns, with that. And then I didn\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m sick, so I would\nthrow up at night, because I couldn\u2019t take the sweat, the smell of the factory. Not that I\nwas a snob, I just couldn\u2019t take it. And then Cornelius got another job with a friend, in --\nwith German lenses, through his brother. Not very much paid, and I -- my mother-in-law\ngot me a job with a designer, Suzy. Suzy with a designer, designed sweaters, and skirts\nwith felt appliqu\u00e9ds, it was very much in fashion. Sold it to Saks, and everything -- and\nwe had a store on the strip. And where we lived 1s, we lived near the strip. It was between\nthe strip and Santa Monica, and at that time the strip was the place. There was the -- the\nmola -- th-the LaRue, there was the Mocambo, Ciro, everything was there. And that was\nthe place there, a main shop, and the factory downstairs, and I worked there. She was\nvery good to me, very good to me, because I caught on just like that, one, two, three. And\nshe would come down, and she would say, \u201cWhat do you think, what should we design?\u201d\nAnd she lived above, in the better area, over Sunset, at that time, on Clark Street. It -- it\u2019s\nsounded center now, where the Billage Hotel 1s, but 1t was at Clark Street at that time.\nAnd we moved out from my mother-in-law\u2019s, and everything they spend on us, we wrote\nit down, and the minute we made 200 dollars, we paid them all back. But what we did is -\n- my teeth were all broken from the calcium I didn\u2019t have, and they worked on it in\nAustria, and they ruined it even more. So I went into a dentist that was down the street,\non Santa Monica and Clark Street, someone sent me. There was a Thrifty drugstore, and\nhis office was upstairs. And I made very good fr -- I made very easy friend, I made very\ngood friends with him. He start working on me, gave me a good price. I didn\u2019t want it for\nnothing, and I paid him off slowly. And we got to be the best of friend. This were our\nfirst friend in America, the Vestliss. And what happened is is my father-in-law went in\nthe basement in the May Company right there, and bought me a black dress, we were\ngoing out, so what I did is, I had a colorful scarf -- because the clothes that I brought\nfrom Europe, I couldn\u2019t wear, with those big pads. Connor\u2019s shoes were squeak --\nsqueaking, you know. It was complete different life, a complete different scene. And\nthese were people that already had catalogs, and -- and -- and live -- lived in Beverly\nWood, in Beverly Hills, in the valley, and so on. And eve -- they got to be very good\nfriends of mine. And I was working at Suzy\u2019s, and Suzy went to Paris. And her husband,\nthat was a very good looking man went after me, and I had to quit. And I didn\u2019t worry,\nbecause I had a job waiting for me at Sidney\u2019s. And Sidney on LaSeneca was also one of\nthe most exclusive -- and all I needed, clothes. Now, when I was at Suzy\u2019s, I went -- I\nmet Marlena Dietrich, I met all the movie stars. Marlena Dietrich, I called her a whore,\nbecause she -- I didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t afraid of her, because she didn\u2019t pay her bills anyways\n[indecipherable] I -- I -- I said -- I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s the different is in English between\nMadame and Madame at that time. So Suzy was downstairs, and she said, \u201cI would like\nSuzy to fit me.\u201d I was upstairs. I said, \u201cSuzy, the Madame is here.\u201d She said, \u201cIn America\nwe say Madame.\u201d Say -- and I knew that she understood German, and Suzy was from\nAustria, her father was a Austrian actor, so I, \u201cSuzy, the hura is here.\u201d The whore is here,\nin German.",
        "A: And, you know, I wasn\u2019t afraid of the devil, you know. But Suzy, they -- in fact, I had\na [indecipherable] too, because the -- she had a publicity lady there at that time, she paid\n200 dollars a month, was a lot of money in the 1950 -- 19 fift -- 1949 - 1950. And she\nsaid, you know -- the publicity lady came in, she took some picture and everything else,\nand she put in a magazine me and Suzy, and cutting out a poodle. And Suzy had a poodle\nnamed Lulu. It said, \u201cSuzy and partner working on a Lulu creation.\u201d Do you know that\nwoman didn\u2019t come in for two weeks 1 -- to the st -- to the -- to the factory? I had to run\nthe factory, because she did not like it that I was with her in the magazine, the public --\nbut it wasn\u2019t my fault, in fact, that actress, Barbara Britten was modeling for us at that\nmagazine at that time. It wasn\u2019t my fault, I didn\u2019t even want to sit there. Who cared if I\u2019m\nin a magazine or not? All I was worrying, where is the next bread coming from? Where\nam I going to pay the detective to look for our stuff, and so on, you know. But at night --\nshe didn\u2019t live very far, and she would have an idea, she was very creative. She would\nhave an idea -- in fact, she was engaged to Groucho Marx at one time. And she would\nhave an idea, and she would say -- she married that guy, Larry. Why don\u2019t you come\nover, Pasternak is here with his wife around the pool and everything, and we can work on\nthe -- on the creation, I have something in my -- so we would work for hours. She never\npaid me overtime, but she always was very good to me, and she bought me certain things\nthat I didn\u2019t have, and so on.",
        "A: But I forgot to tell you, when we moved into that little apartment, over the garage, a\nrent control apartment, Al and Juliet West, who went and signed for me at Sears and\nRoebuck, so we get it on payments, and we bought our bedroom -- we Lysoled it, and we\npainted it. And at that time, 1t was not modern, wooden floors, but it was wooden floors,\nwe shined it. And we had red couches with pink troracks. And we didn\u2019t have a dining,\nwe just had a dining area. And all my friends that lived in Beverly Hills, and everywhere\nelse, they liked to come to -- to my house to eat, because I learned how to cook from my\nmother-in-law. She wa -- she went to Budapest to study cooking business, to teach the\ncooks how to cook. So I got to be a very good cook, so everybody liked to come to my\nhouse. I met a lot of interesting people, very interesting people, because I met the Essex,\nthey should rest in peace, they were all older than I was. He was writing the Mickey\nSpillane movies. I met other people, doctors -- in fact, he had a -- this was the funniest\nthing because I wasn\u2019t used to it. At one time we lived in Beverly Wood at that time, on\nSawyer Street, was a very -- it\u2019s still a very expensive street. And he gave a Halloween\nparty, and I went as Auntie Mame, and he went as my follower. And I -- I took a bracelet,\nand I had jewelry, and I made myself a very fancy thing, with my hair up, you know. And\nI come into his house, and on the drapes were hanging a big -- I hate to say it on the cam\n-- on tape -- a big skeleton with a wiener hanging out. But they all came in diapers. The\ndoctors, the lawyers, those intelligent peop -- they came in diapers. One came as Adam\nand Eve, with fig leafs. And here I was worried, you know, this going on. And then I had\nanother problem with them, because a lot of those intellectuals were on the pink side. Not\nred, but on the pink side, because their background was their parents run away from the\nBolsheviks. You know, from the czar, Bolshevik, whatever it is. So one time they took\nme to a theater, and we saw a show, and it was a union tee -- I don\u2019t know what it was.\nAnd somebody was talking against America. And I s -- got up and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I\nstart walking out the theater. And four of them went after me, my friends, that is --\nnothing should happen to me, that the people shouldn\u2019t kill me. They didn\u2019t tell me where\nthey were taking me. But I had a wonderful time, they are still wonderful people, they\u2019re\nvery old, very old, but wonderful people. And Juliet and Al, Elizabeth and Rolfe are my\nvery closest friend. Elizabeth and Rolfe, they had a big drugstore on the corner of Fairfax,\na old drugstore. And Juliet and Al, Juliet -- when I had my baby, David, I wasn\u2019t allowed\nto have children, because in the concentration camp, you must have heard on the tape,\nthey did something to me by looking for gold. And I tricked my husband into having\nDavid. When I had David, and I couldn\u2019t afford, and I couldn\u2019t get a nurse, it was my\nfirst house, I had a little small house in the valley, where I opened already my own\nbusiness, that Al -- with the help from Al, that wrote me a blank check, if I need money,\nthat he got back every penny, plus. And eliz -- help with Elizabeth and Rolfe. All\nAmerican friends, I didn\u2019t know that -- that -- that survivors exist, only that person that I\ncame on the boat, I told you, with the little boy. I came to visit him in Bull Heights.\nCornelius bought a -- a old car, and we drove there every two weeks to visit him, he\nnever told me survivor existed, because he thought they weren\u2019t good enough for\nCornelius. That was so stupid. Anyway, so what happened 1s is I did this -- where was I?\nIn the middle of telling you the story.",
        "A: About David. When David was born, she gave me a maid, Myrtle, that brought up her\nchildren, for months. For months, because I had the studio already, that I didn\u2019t tell you,\nin Sherman Oaks, to work for me. This is what kind of a friends she was.",
        "A: Rest?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Regina, can I interrupt you? Why don\u2019t you let me tell you before David, when I went\nto school, and I started working on the museum?",
        "A: And then [Il tell you how we bought the -- okay.",
        "A: I went to -- I decided -- my husband\u2019s family was very educated, and I decided that\nI\u2019m not going to let them see that -- like I was born under a stone, somewhere on the\nbeach, especially my brother-in-law that was a philosopher, and very intelligent man, he\njust died about si -- three months ago, at 85. And what I did is, Cornelius went with me\nwith the streetcar from Santa Monica to Hollywood, and every night after work, I went to\nHollywood High. And then, without knowing any survivors or anything, somebody told\nme they are going to build a monument, and they are having a meeting on Vermont.\nHolocaust monument. So I went there, and Is -- the meeting, and all of a sudden, my part\nof the committee. So I prayed -- played through them from school that night when they\nhad a meeting, and I helped build that monument -- I mean the -- the museum. And in\n1978, when we opened the museum, I was chairing it, and that why I wanted to interrupt\nyou to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why am I mad at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell\nyou why. Because before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak\nfor us. I shouldn\u2019t say that on tape, but I have to get it off my chest. And maybe I'll get\nfired for it, but I don\u2019t care. Before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was\nsupposed to speak for us. Our chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a\nmeeting in his house. And I don\u2019t -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and\nsaid that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like\ncattle. And we couldn\u2019t even afford it to open the museum, how can we afford to give\nhim five dollar more to be our -- our speaker at the mu -- at the big dinner, at the opening.\nAnd then the Wiesenthal Center came to us -- that is now the Wiesenthal Center, with the\nproposition theyll give us 25,000 dollars for him. And being that we couldn\u2019t get it more\nfrom the federation, because they gave us a lot, we sold Wiesenthal for 25,000 dollars to\nthe Wiesenthal Center. The Los Angel -- at that time we were the Martyr\u2019s Memorial,\nand the Holocaust Museum, we just changed our name to the Los Angeles Museum of the\nHolocaust because it\u2019s much easier to -- to get to understand it. And that\u2019s why\nWiesenthal for me is absolutely poo, and the reas -- I have been once at the Wiesenthal\nCenter, and that was with a delegation -- this comes later -- with a delegation from --\nfrom Russia, that came to see what we did, and they saw our museum, they saw the\nWiesenthal museum. And let me tell you something, a very famous man from there, that\nhelped build the museum, behind the synagogue in Moscow said that our museum is a\nHolocaust Museum, theirs is a Disneyland Holocaust. I\u2019m sorry to say it on tape, but this\nwhat it is, and if ever anybody hears it, please forgive me, if you\u2019re interested in the\nWiesenthal Center, because it\u2019s strictly too much to do -- I\u2019m so -- corne --",
        "A: And Wiesenthal is -- he should live to 120, I have nothing against him, but he made\nhimself a name. I know him because he lived upstairs, across from us -- leef -- because\nthis was the elite of the DP camp. And across from us lived a name -- a man by the name\nof Ignatz. We called him -- what -- called him, Ignatz? And he was prosecuting the\nHungarian Nazis. And then Wiesenthal took it all over.",
        "A: That was in Linz, in Austria, in Bindermichl. And if he denies it, he\u2019s a liar. Anyway,\nlet\u2019s go back to -- now, we can go back to David.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: David was born then, already, so David was born in 1958. The doctor said I couldn\u2019t\nhave children, because first place our bloods are different, mine and Cornelius, and I was\nafraid. They say the first child it\u2019s nothing, but I was afraid. Also, when -- if you hear my\ntape in -- in the museum, they took me into a room, and they looked for gold. And I was\nvery young, and they did something there, so it was very -- the doctor didn\u2019t want -- they\ndidn\u2019t want me -- but I wanted a child, because when my father -- in 57 they brought my\nfather, that survived Dachau. I worked so hard for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital\nin Los Angeles. I and Cornelius were fundraising in the valley. So they surprised me on a\ntelevision show. It was called at that time, \u201cIt Could Be You.\u201d And they told me I was\ngoing to have -- announce my fashion show, cause I\u2019m giving for Gateway for mental\nhealth. And they came to pick me up, and then they surprised me with my father. And\nwhat happened is my father came, and he came into the -- to my house, and he says, \u201cOh,\na Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children.\u201d And it practically killed me. So -- and then my\nmother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very, very bad accident, and the two sons were\nso good, and they were so terrific, and that day I decided -- and I knew my mother was --\njust has to snap a finger, she had a baby. I remember this as a child, and in ghetto, she wa\n-- a ba -- baby was born. She was made before the ghetto, was born in ghetto. And I said\nto myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to get pregnant, I\u2019m gong to trick him into it.\u201d And I got pregnant.\nAnd being that I am a designer, I wore a certain kind of clothes, that he never noticed it\ntill about the third or fourth month, and then I told him. And I wouldn\u2019t go to a\ngynecologist, but again, one of my model\u2019s husband\u2019s was a very famous gynecologist.\nHe also charged me a big amount, because he thought I was so filthy rich, because of my\nstudio, and his wife models for me. And I went to him, and I was pregnant, and all\nthrough the pregnancy we -- we did out garden in our home -- in our new home, and we\ndid -- the front we added landscape, I -- landscaper. I was bleeding, and I never told the\ndoctor, and I never told -- and David was born prematured. And I had the dachshund at\nthat time that was sick. And -- and I had my little house on Bervis in Van Nuys. And I\nopened in \u201953 ti -- my studio, ameet studio in Sherman Oaks. And when I opened the\nstudio is my friend the Vestliss\u2019, they helped me, and who went looking with me,\nElizabeth, because they had a big drugstore in the valley, and we found that place, and it\nwas -- and I remodeled it in a early American, because I loved the early American,\nbecause that for me presented the country that I came, and that gave me a home. And\neven in my house, in my first house, I had the early American. In my little apartment\nbehind the studio, I had the early American with the hooked rug. And now I go a little\nmore modern. I got used to America. Anyway, and what happened 1s is that I -- I -- I got\npregnant, and I worked, and like I said, I brought my father out, and it upset me, and then\nwhen my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I\u2019m gone there wa -- nobody\ngoing to be left, I have to have something. And I stuck it out, and David was born in the\neighth month. And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that\ntime they just build the Encino hospital, and it wasn\u2019t far from my -- from my studio. So\nwhat happened is 1s I got -- and it was Monday morning, I got terrible cramps, and I\ncalled a friend if she could take me. And she took me in, and the doctor said take her in\nright away, because I had -- delivering another baby. And she was sitting in the front\nroom, and doing a -- she told -- I found out later doing a check, balancing your\ncheckbook. That was all still Americans, not -- no survivors. I didn\u2019t know any survivors.\nAnd the -- they came out and they said, \u201cWhere can we get hold of Mr. Loen?\u201d And\nCornelius\u2019 office always on the ru -- on the road. And th -- she said -- th -- she says,\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Said, \u201cMrs. Loen is being admitted.\u201d So I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a baby,\u201d and\nall the checks were flying all over the waiting room. My friend, the schultz. Anyway, so\nwhat happened is David was born, and he was in a incubator. And I had one stitch. One\nstitch, because I was pretty flexible. And then Fritz was sick, and he was in a -- in\nTarzana in a hospital. So, I had the people working for me in the studio.",
        "A: Fritz was my little dachshund. And -- I took him out from a pound, believe it or not. I\ngave him a home. And he was a pedigree. And he had -- his b-behind legs was hurt -- was\nvery bad, so I took him to the finest hospitals in Tarzana, very far away. So I would go\nand visit my baby in the incubator, then visit Fritz, and then come back to work in the\nstudio.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. I -- 1t told me -- when the doctor was putting me in the hospital -- what was his\nname, Cornell? I forgot, oh.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s -- we were -- we were so close. He was putting me in the hospital, he says,\n\u201cFirst I\u2019m going to save your life, and then I\u2019m going to save the baby\u2019s.\u201d I said,\n\u201cRobert,\u201d rob -- I said, \u201cRobert, if my baby dies, I kill you. I went through eight months,\nand I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d So you see, because I\u2019ve done so much in the concentration\ncamps, and afterwards, with charity, with raising money, and everything else, said, \u201cGod\ncouldn\u2019t do this to me again.\u201d And then, the hospital was so small, and I got terrible\ncramps. It was just built, and they brought in -- in the next room a woman from -- from\nsurgery, she said, \u201cKeep quiet.\u201d That lady just came out, she said -- I said, \u201cBut I\u2019m wet.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t even know that you break water. I never read up on it. So they found Robert right\naway, and he brought with him two doctors, two pediatricians, and he was putting in that\nstitch, and I said, \u201cRobert, are you knitting or purling?\u201d Because I design knitted clothes.\nThis is already under anesthetic. I had a -- he had to give me a spinal because my water\nbroke. And then all of a sudden I hear the other doctor, \u201cIs that you, Marsha?\u201d It was Dr.\nDanielson, his wife was one of my clientele. So you see, I was surrounded by friends\nwhen David was born. And I took him out of the incubator, and after six months I had to\nput him on a skim milk diet, thanks God. And he was reading and writing at two and a\nhalf years old. At three years old, he was -- he knew every president, he knew every\ncomposer. Now, he was not genius. I took him to UCLA. My father-in-law was a very,\nvery intelligent man, and David was his life, so he spent a lot of time with David. David\nhas -- has a photographic memory, like I do. I remember a lot of things as a child, don\u2019t\nforget, that I went through. A lot I forget because I blocked it out, but a lot I remember.\nAnd David has a photographic memory. So one day, he was running up the steps in my\nfather-in-law\u2019s apartment, and he says -- and he\u2019s reading the paper, he\u2019s running up, he\u2019s\nnot -- he\u2019s three years old, and he says, \u201cAppa, Castro is in Moscow.\u201d Yeah, my father-\nin-law should rest in peace, it was his life. One time he took a wooden spoon, and he hit\nhim on the behind. I\u2019ll never forget, he called me up, and he said, \u201cAppa,\u201d that\u2019s an\nHungarian father, he said, \u201cif you do it, 1t doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He loved him so much. In fact, I\nhad to take him to the doctor that treated my father, because the day before he jumped on\nhis bed and everything, and I heard him in his room praying, and he said, \u201cPlease God, if\nI did something wrong, bring my -- my grandfather back as -- as a baby again.\u201d So I took\nhim to his doctor, to my father-in-law\u2019s doctor, and he told him, Dr. Cohen, that his\ngrandfather was very sick, he could not survive, that, in fact, the last day he brought him\na lot of joy by being there.",
        "A: Pll tell you something. I\u2019ve seen a lot of things happen between my American friends\nthat were always Jewish. If the son doesn\u2019t get to be a doctor, or a pharmacist, or\nanything else, and those kids were very unhappy. I never told David anything about the\nHolocaust till he went to go Bar Mitzvah. When -- when he wouldn\u2019t eat, I wouldn\u2019t say I\nwas hungry, why don\u2019t you eat? When he didn\u2019t eat I would say, \u201cDavid, you have to eat,\nthere are so many children hungry in China.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you adopt a couple?\u201d\nThat little fat monster told me that. But I never told David anything, anything. I never\nexposed him to it. David played Little League. I burned my hands on the making\nhamburger there [indecipherable] did in my life, run from the studio, run to the -- to the\nfield, made the hamburgers when it was my day. He played Little League, he loved\nsports, he did judo, anything. In fact, he was -- when he was very little, he was very\nsmart, but not coordinated. To -- my doctor, Dr. Jessup, told me, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take\nhim boxing or judo?\u201d So I took him for judo. So in the beginning he didn\u2019t want to go in\nbecause he didn\u2019t know how to tie his shoes. So I told him, \u201cThen leave it open.\u201d But\nlater on, this was the best thing that I ever did. But I never, never exposed him to the\nHolocaust before he was able to understand. And I won\u2019t tell any, any child about the\nHolocaust that is under 11 or 12 years old, because this is a very horrible story that\nhappened, and it can affect their life. And especially my son, 1t was important to me that\nhe doesn\u2019t feel guilty because of me. That he doesn\u2019t eat, or he doesn\u2019t eat. He didn\u2019t\nwant to be a doctor, he wanted to be a sports re -- the reporter, fine. This is your life, you\nlive it. At 21 he moved out of the house, we moved to the town house. Fine, you live your\nlife. I\u2019m not going to make scene. He 1s 40 years old, he is not married yet. I would love\nto have a grandchild, but if he doesn\u2019t want to get married yet, if he want to play the field,\nfine, what do I care?",
        "A: I told him before he went to -- he started studying for the Bar Mitzvah. I told him what\nhappened, very slowly, and very quietly, because he didn\u2019t want to study for his Bar\nMitzvah. I had to get a private rabbi. I did not belong to a temple, because -- this is\nanother story by itself, I\u2019m not going to go into it. And I -- I ra -- I had the rabbi, I ha -- I\nhired the shul -- a temple, and he had the most magnificent Bar Mitzvah that ever -- he\nhad everything -- at that time, everything was Calypso. And a friend of mine was in the\nlinen supply business. Everything was served flamb\u00e9, and it was kosher, glot kosher,\nbecause at that time I knew a lot of survivors already, and some of them were very\nreligious, and I wasn\u2019t going to commit a sin. So I found a place that was glot kosher, and\nit just opened, the Ventura Club. And -- but everything they gave you, they did your\nflowers, I didn\u2019t like. They gave me hundred dollar deposit, I paid 500 dollars for\nflowers. Imported hats from Mexico, with everything Calypso, every color. I didn\u2019t like\nhis orchestra, so I had another one for the grownups. I changed everything around. They\nwere supposed to do everything, I did everything. But I liked. But it was a beautiful Bar\nMitzvah. And, in fact, David was mostly an atheist. But now, as he 1s getting older, 1s\nvery, very Jewish inclined. And I never pushed him, and I never told him you have to be,\nbecause when came Christmas, we were at my mother-in-laws. Came Rosh Hashanah, we\nwere at my house. My mother-in-law made the be -- on -- on Passover, the best matzo\nballs there is. And I never -- in fact, when my father-in-law had his first heart attack, he --\nmy mother-in-law was running up the street to call us, and she was crossing herself, and\nDavid was only going one way. She star -- she called me up, she said -- as sad as it was\nthat -- where father is and everything, but said, \u201cI have to tell you something. David was\ngoing one way, and I said, David, why are you doing it?\u201d He said, \u201cAnya, I\u2019m half and\nhalf.\u201d You know, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the -- the funny part that comes into a sad life.",
        "A: I was very close to them, to my mother-in-law, and father-in-law, very close. In fact, I\nhad a ex-sister-in-law -- I have a sister-in-law that I\u2019m very close to. She\u2019s Catholic,\nbecause for me it doesn\u2019t matter what religion, what faith, what race, as long -- and\nespecially my mother-in-law and father-in-law, David was their life. That was the only\ngrandson, and that was their life. And my father-in-law, he didn\u2019t live to see it, only\nwanted to live to see David\u2019s Bar Mitzvah. My mother-in-law lived to see it, but my\nfather-in-law didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. And I\u2019m not going to lie to you like other people. It didn\u2019t change for the better. I\nwas -- come from a very religious family. And it\u2019s a town where it was the most famous\nyeshiva, Slabotka Yeshiva. Most of the finest rabbis came out, and my grandfather gave a\nlot of money for it. And he was very religious, and he was -- like I told you, I was his pet.\nAnd he was the first one to be taken away. With a hundred -- with 138, I don\u2019t know how\nmuch it here, but 103 degrees temperature. The first aktja that they had in the Kovno\nghetto, they took away my grandfather, my grandmother, both of them, but the closest\none I was to Shia and Bessa Schneider. And let me tell you -- my mother\u2019s family. And\none time -- my girlfriend died of kidney when she was 38 years old, for a transplant,\nmany, many years ago. And a very famous rabbi, Rabbi Newsbaum was at her home, but\nva -- he didn\u2019t go to ma -- many homes, but he came to Ethela\u2019s home. And I said, \u201cWhy,\nwhy the nice people die first?\u201d And he said to me, \u201cBecause God doesn\u2019t want them to\nsuffer.\u201d I said, \u201cThat is no excuse.\u201d I said, \u201cI have never done anything, my two little\nsisters have never done anything 1n their life.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy did -- one was three years\nold, she didn\u2019t even have a chance to -- to suffer, or not to suffer. This is no answer,\nRabbi.\u201d Then, when I came to the valley, and I was going to have David, I said, \u201cNow\nit\u2019s time to join a temple.\u201d I spent every penny to opening the studio. And Al and Juliet\nWest, they helped me out, I told you. And I went to a very famous temple, I don\u2019t\n[indecipherable] to tell you, Rabbi Weiss. Later on I was with him on the same ticket\nspeaking, with the federation, and then at -- at the big B\u2019nai Brith conference. He didn\u2019t\nrecognize me when I came to the microphone. And I came to him, and I said, \u201cI would\nlike to join your temple.\u201d And he said, \u201cIt cost 750 dollars to join the temple.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cIT can\u2019t afford it,\u201d [indecipherable] He said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you look for another\ntemple?\u201d And since then, I would never join a temple, and I was with him on one ticket\nthat -- that -- at the federation I didn\u2019t say a word. But, when the aliyah start coming in\nfrom Russia, we had a big convention, B\u2019nai Brith convention, and I was there, and it was\nin the aisles microphones, and I came up, and I said, \u201cRabbi, you want us to make Jews\nout of the Russian people. They are coming so poor, and we have to make Jews out of\nthem.\u201d I said, \u201cWasn\u2019t -- do you know me?\u201d He said, \u201cOh yes, Marsha, we were on the\nsame ticket at the federation, at the ballroom.\u201d I said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t you remember in 1957\nI came to you before my son was born, and I wanted to join your temple, and you said to\nme it cost too much money, I should look for another temple?\u201d I got such an applaud, 120\nwomen were there. Here he\u2019s giving -- this 1s such hypocritical -- he\u2019s giving us a lecture\nthat we should help the Russian Jews -- being je -- make them Jews, and -- and -- and --\nand 20 or 30 years ago he refused me to join his temple. He\u2019s not the rabbi there any\nmore. It\u2019s a very good temple, Temple Ariel.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Pll tell you. You'll die laughing. I was sitting in my studio -- sitting in my studio,\nRobert Young was sitting there, he knitted on the set. I used mostly designed for the\nGracie Allen Show. Mostly, it was expensive and -- to have a dress designed by me, or\nthey knit it themself or we made it for [indecipherable] Ice Follies, Mrs. Sheepstead,\nLoretta Young, you know, I had most of the studio people. And we\u2019re sitting -- the\nowners of the Sportsman\u2019s Lounge at that time was Zuzu Fine, and Robert Young was\nsitting, and a very old actress by the name of Ann Harding, I don\u2019t know if people will\nremember, because at that time she was old already. She was on studio one or something,\nI saw the night before. And I get a phone call. I said, \u201cCan I talk to Mariashki\nSupporzhnikov?\u201d And I said, \u201cIsh bin mya,\u201d this woman is speaking Yiddish, I am\nspeaking German because I forgot how to speak Yiddish. I said, \u201cIsh bin Myashka sup,\u201d -\n- lam Myashka Suppozhn.

They are sitting there laughing like crazy for the conversation that\u2019s\ngoing on, and here I\u2019m sitting there, and -- and talking to her, and she said, \u201cNow wait a\nmoment. What kind of a coat did you wear in ghetto?\u201d I said, \u201cI wore a gray poodle coat,\nI'll never forget, with a big, big cub -- .\u201d What do you call it, that you put over your\nhead?",
        "A: A hood.",
        "A: Yeah, and it was made out of poodle cloth, because when I came into the ghetto, I was\nso young, that my clothes grew out of me. So my father found a piece of poodle cloth,\nand he made me a warm coat. And everybody envied me, of course. She said, \u201cOh, you\nare really Myashka Supporzhnikov.\u201d That night I was invited to a very big affair, and I\nstopped off in a home before we -- we went to the party, and from then on I start meeting\nmore and more survivors. I knew survivors, but I didn\u2019t really associate with them,\nbecause they were from Poland. I had nothing did -- I had -- we had nothing in common.\nSo I met a lot of Lithuanian survivors. And this is -- I mean, my life was always the\nmuseum, and always the Holocaust. The first time I start talking was here in the valley. It\nwas one time a very big tycoon, the Glickmans. He was in the eel -- real estate business,\nhe was a multi-millionaire, lost a lot of money. He was 13 years old, and he had the\nhavara group. Was many, many years ago, about 20 years, 30 years ago. And I went to\ntheir home, and a pr -- a -- a teacher from Grant High School at that time, they called it\nthe bagel factory, it was a Jewish high school, and they were the first builders of the\nStefan Weiss Temple, the Glickmans. And they called me over, they said, \u201cWould you\ntalk to havara group, tell them your story?\u201d That was the first time I start talking about\nthe Holocaust, it was about 32 years ago. When he brought me home, that professor, from\n-- from Grant High School, he said to Cornelius, \u201cI created another billi -- Billy Graham.\u201d\nFrom that day on, I start talking about the Holocaust to everyone that will listen, and\nnever stopped. And what happened is is -- but never, never did I tell anybody anything\nthat they didn\u2019t want to hear. The only thing that is before I went to go to be citizen 1n --\nand one of my clientele was a daughter-in-law of Professor J.C. Owens, he was the right\nhand of Hoover. And she said to me, \u201cIf you are going to be, be a Republican, not a\nDemocrat.\u201d And Cornelius, and his mother, and everybody, big Democrats. I says -- I\nsaid, \u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cIll bring you some documents, and I want Cornelius and you to\nread it together, because his English is a little bit better than yours.\u201d I said, \u201cThanks a lot\nMrs. Owens, you just did me a big favor. In front of all my clientele, you are telling me\nthat.\u201d She took it out of the safe, and she brought it to me, and I read the story, when\nHoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do\nsomething about the Jews that are being killed in Europe. He didn\u2019t come himself to Palo\nAlto, he sent somebody, and told them to inform Mr. Hoover that he cannot be bothered\nwith a handle -- handful of Jews. And since then, I came into a friends of mine house, a\nsurvivor also from Lithuania, that had a big picture of hers -- over her fireplace of\nRoosevelt, and that was in the 19 -- late 1950\u2019s, and I spit on his face, and she threw me\nout of her house. And now everything comes out in the open. What I knew in \u201953, is\ncoming out now, with the boat, and with everything else.\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: My Holocaust work is --",
        "A: -- the most important thing in my life after my son and my husband.",
        "A: No, no, absolutely not. When I first started there was people didn\u2019t even know there\nwas a Holocaust. Some Jewish people didn\u2019t know, like I told you, I talked to the havara\ngroup, and it was like I was, you know, something out of the blue. They were shocked\nthat there was a Holocaust. And these were very close friends of mine.",
        "A: And that was in the -- in the li -- yeah, the late 50\u2019s, yes, definitely. And -- no, the\nbeginning of the 60\u2019s already. And the people were -- were shocked what was going on in\nthe Holocaust. Jewish people, friends of mine, Christian people. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if\nthey were Christian, or Jewish, or half and half, or whatever it is. So I made up my mind\nthen and then, that I\u2019m going -- not -- I was left for revenge, and mine only revenge will\nbe not to hurt people, but to teach them that this should never happen again. And that 1s\nmy revenge, and that why I\u2019m still speaking. And that -- we were very rich, we lost a lot\nof money. The same museum that I helped build, and paid out thousand, and thousand,\nand thousands of dollars, I\u2019m working that museum on a salary right now, through the\nfederation, at my age. But I have to, and as long as I can drive, and as long as I can work,\nI will do it. Cornelius is still working again, too. But Pll tell you something, maybe it\nmakes us happier this way. Sometimes I\u2019m very tired, I could hardly get done. Because a\nlot of people that work with me in the museum, that are in higher positions that I am, are\nvery misunderstanding, and don\u2019t understand the feeling. And I\u2019ve talked to somebody at\nthe federation the other week, and he says to me, \u201cWe have a big problem here, Marsha.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s right, psychologically, he said, \u201cYou are one of the high lite -- lay person, and\nnow you\u2019re staff, and that is a big problem.\u201d And he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t stand anything that\nis wrong.\u201d And I said, \u201cI can\u2019t, because you know, when I go out, and I raise in two days,\nfour and a half thousand dollars to put up banners, I want to be consulted if the banners\nare alright or not, because three of them were made, and it was selected the worst of\nthem.\u201d I said -- and that 1s what hurts me. That person that runs that museum, I cannot\nmention name, is very jealous of me, because when it comes -- anything that has to do\nwith museum, everybody knows me, the whole community. Starting from the federation,\nto the - to-- to black young adults, African American, to teachers, to everything else.\nEverybody knows me, and I hope they respect me, and that is the biggest problem. But I\nhave to work, and I -- this is the only job I know. And I\u2019ve learned, believe it or not, at\nmy age, the last three years I been working on the computer, and I\u2019m pretty good at it.",
        "A: And I go out, and you know what? I was supposed to start as -- as a coordinator, and I\nwas on the level of higher pos -- not with money, but on a higher level, and she couldn\u2019t\ntake it. So she put me down as eight -- grade eight. I got the same salary, and I\u2019m union\nanyway, but she didn\u2019t want to have the same paper filled out every two weeks as I did.\nSo I was put as, instead of 10 plus to eight plus, and it didn\u2019t bother me, because I don\u2019t\ngo out for big honor and so on. I also very mu -- many times met, before I started\nworking, I went with Benjamin Meet, and many other people, to Washington for teacher\ntraining, to send out teachers to Yad Vashem, because I am part of the council of post-\nwar Jews organization. I am the treasurer for many years. In \u201991, we honored Benjamin\nMeet, and Vlodka from the American gathering. Benjamin Meet is one of the greatest\nmen that I\u2019ve ever met, because he brought the survivors together. The first gathering that\nwe went to was in Israel, the second one was in Washington. In fact, in the Washington\nmuseum, I just got a book from the Washington museum, I left it in our museum, is you\nopen the middle, and there is my best friend from ghetto. When I was a little girl he was\nmy boyfriend, Abe Malnik. And it\u2019s a big pictures of him, on a -- on a TV screen. I don\u2019t\nknow if you\u2019re seen it, the last jo -- the last book that came out. I also am in touch\nconstantly with Malsy at the book store, because we sell a lot of guides to you, called,\n\u201cThose Who Dared,\u201d and \u201cRescue.\u201d That was done by the Martyr\u2019s Memorial at that\ntime, under the leadership of Alex Grubman.",
        "A: Pll tell you, I interviewed for the Shoah Foundation 110 survivors, because I needed it\n-- they paid me, and also I wanted to know a lot -- you see, I didn\u2019t want to talk about\nthings I didn\u2019t know, that you read out of a book. And when I arranged for the Holocaust\nmuseum, for the Martyr\u2019s Memorial, to go out for people to speak, and to give tours in\nthe museum, I\u2019ve always told them, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything that you didn\u2019t go through. You\ntalk only about your own experiences,\u201d because there was, at that time I coached Abe\nSpiegel, and I coached Ed Lasabnik, and I coached the first three chairs, the lay chairs.\nAnd I was the lay person that coached the -- those people. I also was fundraising for\nB\u2019nai Brith in the meantime, fundraising for ORT, but I could never take the presidency,\nbecause always came the museum ahead of it. I was -- I was one of the first people, with\nmy husband, with the Carters, and many people in the valley, with the Katz\u2019s, they were\nolder than we are. We raised money to establish the --",

We bought the Hoover lot, and I\nand Cornelius were fundraising. I\u2019m very good at fundraising, and especially when I had\nthe money, and I gave, I got back a lot. Even now, when we needed banners, I raised the\nmoney for it. I work for the museum, but I really work with my heart. If you don\u2019t get a\nspeaker, I speak. If you don\u2019t -- we need to work the computer, I work the computer. If\nyou need this, I do this. But, the only thing that hurts me very badly is that the person that\nruns the museum does not like me. Absolutely doesn\u2019t understand survivors, and\nabsolutely doesn\u2019t like me. But that will change, I hope, in the near future.",
        "A: It was my own fault, Regina, because when the f -- the director left, and he was\nwriting a book that is just coming out, called, \u201cThe Deniers.\u201d It will come out in 2000, I\nhope I live to see it. And he didn\u2019t have much time. I was working just as coordinator,\nand then when he left, he wrote a letter to the head of the federation, that till they find a --\na -- a director, I can run the museum, and this person can help me. And I did that, and in\nthe long run, she got to be the director of the museum. She doesn\u2019t have a PhD., she has a\nMaster degree, but that\u2019s not important.

        "A: Okay.",
        "A: It hurts me very much, this subject. Because the museum has to stay, because I put --\nthis was the first museum built in the United States of America. We had breakfast with\nElie Wiesel. I still have the picture of me and Elie Wiesel, and Freddie Diamond. And\nElie Wiesel at that breakfast, was a very small breakfast from the federation, said that this\nwas a jewel. We were on the 12\" floor of the Jewish Federation building. And then we\nstart -- they start building the Washington museum, and Lydia Bodka is the president of\nthe Council of Post-War Jews organization. And every year in February -- now I can\u2019t,\nbecause I work, we went, and when I had the money, and we helped Latka and Benjamin\nMeet send people all through the concentration camps, and Yad Vashem -- teachers, to be\nable to teach the Holocaust. When I started to -- not lecture, I don\u2019t call it a lecture -- talk\nabout my experiences in the Holocaust -- I\u2019m not a lecturer, I\u2019m not a teacher. I -- 1t was\ndone here a little bit, and there a little bit, and there a little bit, and people came by the\nhundreds to the museum when it first opened, because for them it was new. I was 10\ndays, I'll show you, from the president of the University of Utah, southern Utah. I was\nsupposed to be 48 hours, I stayed for 10 days. I set up a Holocaust museum in the library,\nand the kids were coming down from the mountains, the Indian kids, and all kind of kids.\nAnd it was called Jewish week. And there was all different kind of illel, did a lot of\ncooking, and dancing, and so on. There was one Jewish students in the whole -- at that\ntime it was a college, now it\u2019s a university. So -- and I paid for everything, and then there\nwas a director from Yad Vashem working, Shome Balmar, at that time, at our museum,\nand I called, and I saw all those big people from Israel, from the American Jewish\ncommittee, and so on. So I -- right away I send him a ticket he should come right away to\nUtah. And then he lectured at the washing -- at the Einstein hall. So you see, whenever I\ntalk, and whatever I do, I always end up Holocaust -- talking about the Holocaust, and\nwhat it should be done about the Holocaust. You know, about a couple of weeks ago, I\ncouldn\u2019t get speakers. And the museum 1s small now, very small, because we are sharing\ntill the other building is finished, we are sharing the whole first floor of a building with\ntwo other agencies of the federation, with the library, and the Jewish Historical Society.\nSo, when they have a big group, we divide it in three parts. We send them to the\nmonument, we have a big monument at Palm Pacific Park, that was built by survivors,\nand I was on the committee too. In fact, I\u2019m engraved in the committee. And we have the\nmuseum, so what we do is we divide it in three groups. And I couldn\u2019t get any speakers\nthat day, so I spoke to three different groups at the same time, the same day. And worked.",
        "A: So, you can see that Holocaust is my life.",
        "A: Not the Holocaust. I\u2019m sorry for that expression, the hol -- to remember the Holocaust,\nthat this should never happen again. It -- not only Jews died in the Holocaust. I was in a\ndeath camp, Stutthof, where on the other side there were Catholic priests, there were\nGypsies, there were homosexuals, people -- prisoner of wars, people that didn\u2019t agree\nwith Hitler, that were killed in that place. Stutthof is the only camp that the original gas\nchamber -- the original crematorium is still standing. But this is the forgotten death camp.\nI wrote a couple of articles in papers about the forgotten death camp, and if you notice,\nwhen you were here originally, I made that phone call the minute there is to give out\nmoney for survivors or anything, I call all my people that I know, and if they can\u2019t make\nthe phone calls, I do it. We have a guide in the museum that we composed for where and\nwhen the people should call. For insurance claims, for -- for Swiss money, for everything.\nIf anybody calls -- we send out about at least -- at least 800 -- 800 to a thousand of those\nguides for survivors to do it.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: The something that bothers me 1s that a lot of them are adding certain things that other\npeople went through, that they discussed with. And that what bothers me when I was\ninterviewing, because I read a lot about the Holocaust, even for the Polish people, and\nAuschwitz, and -- and Majdanek, and everything else. I worked with, \u201cThe Triumphant\nSpirit,\u201d with Nick Decalsio on the book. And it bothers me when people -- like take the\nHungarians, from Budapest I\u2019m talking about. They didn\u2019t -- they -- they only start\nsuffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944. But they also suffered, and a\nlot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything. But I don\u2019t think they went through\nthe things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939. Like, I\ncouldn\u2019t say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- \u201939, or the\nGerman Jews. But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived\npretty good. You understand what I mean? And like again with the Anne Frank\u2019s diary.\nYou take the Anne Frank\u2019s diary, there\u2019s hundreds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne\nFrank\u2019s diary was found first. And I want to tell you a story about Anne Frank\u2019s diary.\nMy cousin, Leah Salisbury that converted to baptism -- I don\u2019t know what she converted,\nshe married a guy -- she\u2019s my mother\u2019s cousin, she wasn\u2019t my cousin, she was the literary\nagent to Anne Frank\u2019s diary in -- in America. I never had a lot to do with her, because her\nmother was Jewish, and she didn\u2019t do it very much, she only had to do -- she only had to\ndo with show people And she wanted me to come to her estate in -- in Sanvits shwanza,\nsomewhere in New York, Connecticut, whatever it is -- I don\u2019t know what it -- what it is.\nI never went, because I didn\u2019t like it the way she treat her mother. It was her mother 80\"\nbirthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother\u2019s aunt. And I went there --\nAunt Molly, and her biggest pleasure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and\nthings like that. And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left. So when\nshe send me tickets when Anne Frank\u2019s diary was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I\ndidn\u2019t go. And I don\u2019t really believe in Anne Frank\u2019s diary. I believe that it happened, of\ncourse, it did happen. But there is so many diaries been written, there\u2019s so many children\nbeen hidden, there\u2019s so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three\nyears old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn\u2019t even know what it means that little piece\nof bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or\nanything. But she knew every German. They were so smart, like God has give them more\nhead, or something. Every German that walked by, she knew by name, when she was\nhidden. You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my\nmother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters. And that why she was killed at 34\nyears old, in Stutthof. I don\u2019t know, like I told you, where she was killed. Now that I read\na lot more about -- when I start reading more about Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz, and\neverything that was going on, I don\u2019t know where she was killed.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Definitely, and that why most of our speakers of the museum can only speak about\ntheir experiences. If they do not speak about their experiences, they are not called again.\nBecause, you know, like I told you, some very intelligent men ask me about the Warshaw\nghetto, and I told him, \u201cI would insult your intelligence if I tell you, because I read the\nsame book that you can pick up off the shelf, and read it in there in the library.\u201d",
        "A: They look in a much nicer way than they did, because the survivors made something\nof themself. That why I like the survivors to buy, \u201cThe Triumphant Spirit,\u201d and see what\npeople made of themself. Like, the biggest toy factory 1s owned by Mr. Cort. The -- that\ngave a lot of money to the Washington museum, he gave a lot of money to the\nmonument. He gives, and gives, and gives, for the Holocaust. Mr. Webb. Most of the\nsurvivors. Mr. Chappel, here in los -- I can only talk about the people in Los Angeles that\nI know. One of my very, very good friend, was much older than I was, he just not long\nago died, helped build the monument in Florida, Abe Resnick. You must have heard of\nhim. He comes from Kovno. He was in Kovno ghetto part time. I knew people that -- that\nmade so much of themself, the survivors, that you have to have respect for them. You just\nhave to. Even if you don\u2019t like what they tell you. Even if you feel guilty that you\ncouldn\u2019t help them, that you didn\u2019t help them. You still have to have respect for what\nthey made of themself. You take me, a little girl comes into -- married a guy that most of\nthe family is Christian, I\u2019m Jewish, very, very brought up Jewish, come from the\nconcentration camps, my husband was in a labor camp. Thanks God my mother-in-law\nwas very understanding and helped a lot of Jews, I told you she\u2019s a Righteous Christian\nand everything. But still, my brother-in-law was in America, having -- living a playboy\nlife, you understand what I mean? And so on. And here comes that little -- poor little girl,\nyou know. And thanks I God -- but I didn\u2019t let it happen to me. This is the survivor\u2019s\nspirit. I didn\u2019t let them think of me that he is better than I am. No. I am the one that is\nfeared. I didn\u2019t fear him, he feared me. You know why\u201d Because I didn\u2019t let him get\naway with it. Because I was better than he was. He didn\u2019t go through what I went\nthrough, and had to go to school and everything. His father paid for everything. I did it\nmyself. Do you understand what I am talking about? Maybe people won\u2019t understand\nwhat I am talking about, but I feel very, very good about it.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "A: My life was very rich, thanks God.",
        "A: I went to Europe for a -- for months, and month. I was very wealthy at one time, and I\nwent to Europe, and I went to the first one -- when Hawaii wasn\u2019t a state yet, I went to\nHawaii. I went -- my friends were very well-to-do friends, and some of them took us to\nLa Jolla, and you know, I went to places where people -- I don\u2019t say -- you know, my son\nwas born a little later, like I told you, I couldn\u2019t have children, so I had a little more time\nthan the other people had. They had to bring up their family. A lot of the survivors were\nlonesome, so they got married just with anybody, you understand what I mean? Maybe\nthey -- they didn\u2019t fit, but they made a life together, they brought up their children\nbeautiful. The only thing that I don\u2019t agree, that most of the survivor pushed their\nchildren. And I was -- stood by it, and watched it, and it hurts. And a lot of them are sick.\nA lot of them are very sick, and a lot of them need psychiatrists.",
        "A: Pll tell you. Many times I\u2019ve need help, but you know what? My husband was my\nbest psychiatrist. I talked a lot of things over with him. And like I said, I told you I\u2019ve\nlearned to do self hypnosis, because nobody -- I was too strong for anybody to hypnotize\nme. And I made a lot of friends. I didn\u2019t have time -- I didn\u2019t have -- I lectured on the\nHolocaust, I worked. My studio was -- you know, I had contact with very unusual people.\nYou know, show people are very unusual people. You know, like Cary Grant ordered\nfrom me a -- a golf sweater, and he send in his manager to bargain with me. And I told\nhim, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to me. He doesn\u2019t want it, let him go somewhere else.\u201d A hand\nknitted golf sweater in cashmere. Zsa Zsa Gabor once says to me, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have to\npay you the bill, my name is good enough, that I come to you.\u201d I said, \u201cMuch bigger\npeople than you are coming to me, and I don\u2019t mean show people. I mean scientists. I\nmean other people, just -- just any people. They don\u2019t have to be in show peop -- show\nbusiness to have a brain.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell her that there is no brain, I\u2019m sorry. But\nthat\u2019s it. You know, she had looks, and that was important.",
        "A: This is full of baloney. I think a survivor is a normal person, absolutely normal, much\nmore normal as some of the Americans I\u2019ve met. And believe me, most of my friends are\nAmericans. And like I told you, 1t went by eight years before I met with the survivors.\nAnd I tell you something, I had one girlfriend, h-her son -- I didn\u2019t have children yet, and\nher son only ate lamb chops with ketchup. I mean, this is abnormal. If my son would do\nit, I would say he\u2019s crazy. I wouldn\u2019t make it lamb chops a -- and if a daughter, God\nforbid, took a piece of her lamb chops, Ann Marie had two problems. I mean, this 1s\nabnormal. But for s -- for saying the survivor are abnormal, no. I feel -- I feel much more\n-- much more up to date, and up to life, and if I die tomorrow, I have lived a very rich,\nbeautiful life. Poor or rich, even if I lost my money -- at one time I was very depressed\nbecause I di -- we [indecipherable] twice -- three times, but then I talk to myself. I said,\n\u201cMarsha, you lost so much in your life, does those things mean anything to you?\u201d After\nthe earthquake, when I lost everything. And then in the middle of the shakes I went to\nhelp a friend that lived up in the hills, in the dark, with my husband, because she was\nthere alone. That was more important to me than my Rosenthal, and my Lalique, and\neverything else. To get into the car in the dark, and the shakes were still going, you know,\naftershake, to go and help my friend. And would any average American do that? And I\nfeel myself they would. And that why I call myself an American. I worked for the man\nthat I like. I do everything that the country needs, because that country gave me life, gave\nme freedom, gave me everything.",
        "A: Yes, to a certain extent about the schools, very much so. That why I send my ha -- my\nson in the beginning to a private school. When I went in the public school, it was\nhorrible. And there\u2019s a lot of things that -- that could be -- when I first came to this\ncountry it was so peaceful, it was so beautiful in 1949. You could walk on the streets, you\ncould have a ball. And now all this murdering, and everything that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s --\ndoesn\u2019t come out of the people, it\u2019s the way the people are treated. And if you say, oha\nblack American did it -- I -- I mean A-African American did it, or a -- a -- a -- a-- a -- O-\nOriental did it, or this one did it. What about the skinheads, what they did to the\nsynagogues in Sacramento? What about Jewish people that do certain things? And what\nabout Christian white people that do certain things? There\u2019s no such a thing, I -- unity is\nthe most important thing, and that country does not have unity right now. That\u2019s the\nproblem. And that why it\u2019s very important that the kids in school, or in college, or in the\nuniversity, are learning about unity. That the person is flesh and blood. They are not --\neven an animal is protected by the animal society, but the -- the African American that\ndoesn\u2019t have food 1s not protected. I know what it means to be without food. I know what\nit means to be cold. I know those things, so I feel with those people. In a country that is\nthat rich, and helps everybody else. Kosovo, Shmosovo, everything. Help your country,\ntoo. I don\u2019t say they shouldn\u2019t help the people. They definitely should. But help your\ncountry, too.",
        "A: Yeah. I was hurt by a friend, so I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it, so I went home --\nyou know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a amateur poet. I don\u2019t write all odays, I just write rhymes.\nSo I would like to read you the poem. The poem is called, \u201cFriendship.\u201d Friendship is a\ngift from God. The love from a second person that draws you like a lightning rod. It takes\npatience, it takes understanding, because if you break those rules, it cannot easily be\nmended. That is why we go through life to find a way to understand that person who 1s a\nfriend, and try to keep that friendship, and lend a hand. But if that person get jealous and\nbitter, 1t is hard to keep your cool and ditter. To forgive it\u2019s easy, sometimes hard. Who\nknows the right thing, and who is smart? Is that person who calls himself my friend, or is\nthat person I do not understand. The only one who knows 1s me, I feel the love, I feel the\nglee. To be bitter, and to hate is very easy, but there is better things in life to keep my\nbusy. Hatred hurts only that person who projects it. That is why I say, forget hate, keep\nyour friendship and don\u2019t neglect it.",
        "A: Yes, very. And if somebody hurts me, I just -- I can\u2019t take it sometimes. So, instead of\narguing, or doing something, I just write a poem, or just an article, or anything. What I\nwanted to tell you is, Regina, that I\u2019m a very lucky person that I\u2019m connected with the\nJewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. They gave me a job at a certain age, when\nnobody would have given me a job, when I need it. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m very grateful to\nthem, and I will be grateful to them the rest of my life. And that again 1s the Jewish\nFederation of Greater Los Angeles.",
        "A: I went to Israel. I practically ended up in Palestine, but -- when I was smuggling than\nthe people, but I went to Israel. The first time I was supposed to go to Israel was in \u201967,\nand the war broke out. I was in Russia. I did not go to any of the concentration camp, I\nnever will go. In fact, when I was in Lithuania -- that\u2019s why I went -- I did not go to\nKovno, I stayed in Wilno. Because I won\u2019t give him the satisfaction, to go to Poland and\nspend money, to the murderer. It went to Kovno -- I went to Lithuania, to Russia because\nI had to. There was a reason, there was a mission. My sis -- older sister was there. And at\nthat time I went as a friend, because it was still Communistic, and I had to wait two and a\nhalf years for a visa. And then I had to stay in a certain hotel, and everything else. But\nnever, never, would I go to Poland, or to anywhere where there are concentration camps,\nand have give them the satisfaction to spend money there. I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it. I went\nall over Europe. I went to the Mamblon, I went to Italy. I know there were concentration\ncamps everywhere. There was one in Ebensee that I didn\u2019t even know. I was skiing in\nEbensee with my husband. We went there because how far was it from Tronkishin where\nwe had the hotel, and we went from -- from -- from Linz, to -- to -- to ve -- I went to --\nwe went on our honeymoon, we stayed at the Vicearussel near the Glosegrog, you know,\nthe -- what do you call, the oldest lakes. It was in alt -- no, it was in Wolfgangsay.",
        "A: Wolfgangsay. And I went always on trips all through Europe and everything, but still,\nI went to Italy, I went to -- like I told, went -- we went to the Mamblon. In \u201967, I was\nsupposed to -- I went to Russia, and then my husband meet me, we were supposed to go\nto Israel, but the war broke out, it was the Six Day War, so I couldn\u2019t go there. So I went\nthere the year after, and then I went for the gathering, and then I went for the -- went in\n1979. Then I went in 1985, and they had the -- for the partisans. Then I went again in\n1989. And then when my ankle broke, it\u2019s very hard for me to travel by plane, so I\nhaven\u2019t been there since. But I have papers, I\u2019Il show it to you. I have a beautiful citation\nfrom the Mengele twins, because I always visit people that were connected with the --\nwith the Holocaust, and they were hurt by the Holocaust, and made friends with them,\nand did something for them that I could. I went -- they were here, I had a symposium for\nthem in Los Angeles. I can tell you, I went in Israel, I have -- I found family in Israel, and\nI was very happy. Whenever I went there, I was very, very happy.",
        "A: No. Absolutely no. My cousins, and my aunt, they\u2019re not Orthodox. They are Jewish,\nthey -- they -- they -- they have their religion, they go to temple, and everything else, they\nhave the Passover. In fact, one day I was there on Passover one time, and mostly I stayed\nin a hotel, I stayed with my cousin Leah. And my -- my uncle died first, then I -- they\nwere well-to-do people, they have a -- they had a electric factory, and so on. My cousin\nLeah\u2019s husband had a garage. So there was no problems of any kind, and they were very\nhappy to come here, and I was very happy to go to Israel. And most of it was the\ngathering of the survivors in Israel that Benjamin Meet arranged. I went to Yad Vashem,\nand one year -- see, my mother-in-law died. She was brought out of the Hungarian club\ninto Israel, and they gave a big, big deal for her, but she didn\u2019t have time. She was\nhonored here in \u201968 with some trees in Israel. W-We put in Putnam. I have a big citation\nfor her. Like I said, I don\u2019t take citation all over the place. And then I went -- then I went\nin \u201985, and I insisted -- because they knew me in Yad Vashem arad, and ev -- a-and sh-\nshow me -- everybody knows me -- knew me, and so I say -- I insisted that I want the tree\nalready planted. So they went through the books, and they found it, and the tree was\nplanted with two other people from Holland, at the same time. And it looks down on the\nfallen soldiers, from the mountain. I haven\u2019t seen it since, I\u2019m sorry to tell you that. But\none of these days, maybe if we\u2019re still alright, and Cornelius 1s alright, we'll take a trip\nand go over and see the tree.",

We always had a country, it was always the Jewish country, Israel, the\ncountry of the Jews, but we have a country, and in that country was the first Holocaust\nmuseum built. And then there is another one, the -- I forgot the name of it, it\u2019s ina\nkibbutz. Loch -- Loch hamma cut tahowt. It\u2019s a more partisan, and so on. I helped with\nthat one, too. And Dr. Kulka -- I told you, Dr. Harry Kulka took me through the museum,\nthen he took me to the University of Jerusalem.

If somebody -- if you have teacher training like we have in\nthe museum every year, a teacher training, and we do it with different agencies, like the\nADL, the labor committee, the American Bureau of Jewish Education, we do it together,\nand that is very important. Teacher training, so the teacher knew, when it comes to\nhistory, that, like the Spanish Inquisition, and the Crusaders, this also has to be told in\nhistory, because it happened, and it happened to a people, and for no reason at all. And\nit\u2019s good for the people in America to know it, because like I said, it\u2019s such a melting pot,\nthat the people should get along together properly.",
        "A: I would tell them, like you g -- like the Jews go on Yom Kippur to temple, and pray.\nThat happened 2,000 years ago. This only happened 50 some odd years ago, and believe\nme, much, much more that happened on Yom Kippur. And I think the Yom HaShoah is\nthe most important thing, for any religion, or any people. It\u2019s important for us Jews, but a\nlot of people should come and see it, and hear it. Because this 1s like going to temple on -\n- on Yom Kippur. This happened 2,000 years ago, but it\u2019s still the tradition, and we still\ndo it. And people stand in line to get tickets to go to it. But the Yom HaShoah only\nhappened 56 years ago, and six million of our people were killed. And that is -- that is our\nyom -- that is my Yom Kippur. Do you know in the beginning, before the survivors start\ndying off, I was jealous of a funeral, I told you on the tape. You know. And now, I\u2019m\nafraid to go to funerals. I\u2019m afraid to pick up the telephone, because the survivors are\ngoing so fast. And that why the testimony is so important, it\u2019s very important, that it\nshouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Look at what happened to the Spanish Inquisition. What do you\nread in the dictionary? A date, a time, what happened, and finished with. Are there books\non it? Not many. And look at what happened, and it\u2019s practically forgotten. This will\nnever be forgotten, as long as I can help it.",
        "A: Sometimes it\u2019s overdone, and sometime it\u2019s not true. The \u201cSchindler List,\u201d is the one\nthat is the closest, and still it\u2019s still a movie. Let\u2019s not kid ourself. The best one that I ever\nsaw was last month, \u201cThe Shoah,\u201d because it was interviews. And you see what\ninterviews can do.",
        "A: Of a master is right. And there\u2019s the -- you still see those little pieces of anti-Semitism\nwas flying in the background, but people don\u2019t notice it, and -- certain people notice. And\nI think he did the best that ever was, I\u2019m sorry. Spielberg was alright, I fainted, I went to\nthe bathroom. I -- I never fainted in my life, but I -- all of a sudden I had to run to the\nbathroom and throw up. But I came back -- because I was the volu -- Los Angel -- Valley\nTimes ask me I should get about three or four survivors at the opening of \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList,\u201d and then the lady interviewed us, the reporter, and I did, and I watched it, and I\nnever watched it again. But I did interview survivors, and I\u2019ve learned a lot from\nsurvivors by interviewing them, the 110 survivors.",
        "A: When they carried those children on the carts. This is when I row -- run out and throw\nup, because I\u2019m sure my little sisters was carried somewhere on a cart, or disappeared\nsomewhere, somehow.",
        "A: The shooting, and everything else, I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve -- I -- I -- I went through it. You\nunderstand what I mean? You have to ask that from an American. You understand,\nRegina? But I personally, when the children on the cart, when they were carrying in that\ncamp, this is what I couldn\u2019t take it.",
        "A: Yes. My mother yelling to me, if you survive, Myashinka, go to Palestine, and find\nSoatsky. And that was my aunt in Israel, Sarah. And also another thing is when they\nseparate me, the man and the woman, when they brought us to Stutthof in cattle cars, and\nthey separated the man and the women, send my father to Dachau, and my mother and\nme and the kids to Stutthof, and my father was yelling, \u201cGive us the poison tablets, give\nus the poison tablets. You don\u2019t want that.\u201d And my mothers said, \u201cNo. Even if a finger\nis left alive, Iam going where the Jewish people are going.\u201d But let that end on a real\nhappy thought. I\u2019m an old lady now, I work. You see we live a pretty normal life, pretty\nAmerican. My accent I couldn\u2019t get rid of, I went for speech therapy, I couldn\u2019t get rid of\nit, I\u2019m sorry. And --",
        "A: Thank you. I don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t help it. And you see, I have a s-son, that goes -- you\nheard him go already twice since you are here. He lives in Las Vegas, he has his own life\nto live. And he comes -- is coming out now on my birthday, on the 28\", cause I can not\ndrive and fly by plane. And then, I don\u2019t like Las Vegas, it\u2019s too | -- noisy, and too much\nthings. Last time I went to Las Vegas two years ago on Thanksgiving, and he had a\nstomachache. We were supposed to go out for Thanksgiving. So now I said forget it. If I\nwant to play cards, I go to one of the casinos, and that\u2019s all -- they\u2019re here in Los\nAngeles. I don\u2019t have to go and see those -- that they spend thousand -- there\u2019s so many\nthousands of homeless people lying around the streets all over America, and they\u2019re\nbuilding millions and millions of dollars hotels in Las Vegas. Not that we don\u2019t need it,\nwe need that too, but there 1s a limit to everything. Yesterday I went shopping. There\nwere standing people, and collecting for AIDS, near Juan\u2019s. So I sent Cornelius in to get\ncanned food for them. And I tried to give as much as I can. When I had the money,\neverybody got. But now I try to give as much as I can. In fact, somebody told me I\u2019m too\ngenerous. Because when I drive by in the morning, I drive by a bakery that has bagels,\nand I had on a -- a -- a department in the federation, they used that I bring them bagels\nand cream cheese in the morning, for the department. So if -- if I can -- now we are\nseparated, the federation and the museum, and in different places till the building is\nredone. So now I have to wait till somebody comes to pick it up, or I run over and take it\nover. And this is my biggest pleasure, even if it costs me money, that I work, and it\ncomes to me very hard. But this is my pleasure.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What gives me pleasure? Like I told you, I had my studio, and I did a lot of knitting,\nso I do that a little bit, and it gives me pleasure to go to art show, museums. And it give\nme pleasure to -- do you know what I like to watch? This is the craziest thing, the classic\nmovies, the old movies. Isn\u2019t that ec -- that relaxes me. And after reading a Holocaust\nbook, or something else, I buy myself a little romance book, to relax me. So I lay down in\nbed, and Cornelius watches television downstairs, and I read that -- and I go from the first\npage, to the middle, to the last page, to know what the ending is. And that relaxes me, and\nI fall asleep with it.",
        "A: An example is that I learned that they are -- some are very, very -- how do you say it --\nhow do -- | -- say -- some are very depressed, and very down, and you have to be around\nthem, but it happens very seldom to pick them up. I also learned that when I go to a party,\nthey dress like young girls, 70 and 75 year old women. They want to stay forever young,\nbecause they never had a childhood. And they never had, really, a young life, because\nthey had to work, and bring up a family, and everything else. To me, being a designer, it\nhurts my eyes. But I know what they feel, psychologically. The third thing is what\nbothers me tremendously is that the survivor money is handled by Americans. And that\nhurts very badly, because there 1s a lot of survivors, and needy survivors still alive. I get -\n- I got acall from a 91 year old woman that has nothing to eat. A survivor.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not enough. What -- what can she do, a woman, she\u2019s 91 years old, she needs\nsome help. She needs somebody to help her, or be put in a home. Or when a survivor\ngoes into a state home, and there is millions of dollars in -- in New York. A survivor\nshould never, after what they went through, stay in a state home, should be treated\ncompletely different. Not because he\u2019s a survivor, and he\u2019s something special. He should\nhave -- his end should be easy on that person, if it\u2019s a man or woman. Maybe I\u2019m wrong,\nmaybe I am expecting too much.",
        "A: Like we\u2019re getting the money from Switzerland, and it\u2019s going on education, it\u2019s going\non everything else. But they don\u2019t remember when they tore my earrings off my ear. And\nmy little ring that my grandfather gave me to get away. And I didn\u2019t want to give it, and\nmy mother said, \u201cGive it to them, give it to them.\u201d They don\u2019t remember when they told\nus 1f you don\u2019t bring in your goods, plus your ironing, plus our electrical appliances. Not\nonly the gold, and the silver, and the platinum, the electric appliance and everything,\nyou'll be shot. Everybody\u2019s forgotten that. And they say that the Jews are greedy,\nbecause we -- we -- we -- we ask what is belonging to us, that\u2019s coming to us. They\nhaven\u2019t seen nothing from it yet. Not for me. I need it, too, believe me I do. Driving\nevery day over the canyon to go to work, and then have to listen to a lot of things that I --\nI am very ve -- get very upset, and I come home, and I get sick. Not from the Holocaust,\nthat I am told, from my superiors. You understand? It\u2019s not easy on me, but I needed\nwork, and I have to stay. Don\u2019t you think it would help me if I had some money, what\nwas taken away from me? And -- and I help. I am on -- I am on the council, I am the\ntreasurer of the council. Today was supposed to be a meeting in my house, we\u2019re\nhonoring a survivor that\u2019s going to be 90 years old. We honored Latka and Benjamin\nMeet in -- in 1991. We -- we do a lot of vienna poldi, fill a page for doing \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList.\u201d The council is very important, we are involved with the money to distribute for the\nneedy survivors.",
        "A: I want to thank the people -- can I know their name?",
        "A: Yeah. Where 1s it -- sit -- yeah. I would like to thank very much Mr. Jeff and Toby\nHerr for doing the grant for the interview, or whatever they did to get that interview\ngoing, because that will be a step stone in the museum, and for children to learn about the\nHolocaust. So -- and thank you, Regina, very much for coming and interviewing me.",
