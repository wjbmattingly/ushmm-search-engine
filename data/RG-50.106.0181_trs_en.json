        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Irene Silver, conducted by Gail Schwartz, on March 1\u201c,\n2010, in Olney, Maryland.",
        "Answer: It\u2019s Silver Springs. It should be Olney, but they decided on Silver Spring\nas being the address.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of File OneMarch 1, 2010\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Irene Silver. And you were talking about your\nexperience raising your children and \u2014 and their religious \u2014",
        "A: Affiliations?",
        "Q: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, that was about it, as far as that, you know, that \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re all\nbringing up their children in the Jewish tradition. Since I was never that deeply\nsteeped in religion, certainly I \u2014 I don\u2019t feel that they should be doing anything\ndifferent. And \u2014 but I\u2019m happy about the \u2014 the way that they are being brought up\nin.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. Are you more comfortable with people who lived through the war,\nthan let\u2019s say Americans here, who never had to experience what you experienced?\nAre you angry that others \u2014 that you had to experience things that others didn\u2019t have\nto, by living in a different country?",
        "A: No. I am basically \u2014 I\u2019m basically very tolerant. I don\u2019t judge other people, and\nthe fact that I had to live through the war, and others didn\u2019t, I\u2019m happy that some\npeople didn\u2019t have to experience it. Of course, I\u2019m angry that \u2014 that the people who\nwere there, and \u2014 and suffered, that \u2014 that, of course, is a very deep anger, but youMarch 1, 2010\ncan\u2019t be angry forever, you can\u2019t think about it forever, or your life will become\nmiserable. And am I more comfortable? Not necessarily. I have very close friends\nwho have never gone through an \u2014 through it. But I do feel more comfortable, and\nbe f \u2014 and \u2014 and are close to those friends of mine who \u2014 who understand, as much\nas they can, what happened. I don\u2019t think I would be very comfortable with people\nwho say, well, you know, what happened, happened, and let\u2019s just forget about it. I\nwould not want to hear that. There\u2019s one other thing that sometimes comes up, and\nit really, I think is unfair and bothers me; 1s when people say, well, why didn\u2019t the\nJews rise up? Why did they just go there like sheep? Well, times were very\ndifferent. Civilians did not have any arms. They couldn\u2019t defend themselves against\nan army. How could a civilian without any arms, stand up to an army, with \u2014 with\nguns and ammunition, and \u2014 and tanks, and everything else. And in the end, there\nwere those who were still surviving in the ghetto, who did fight, and they fought to\nthe end. But that was at the very, very end, and they felt they would try to do\nanything they could. But the general population, they had no way to defend\nthemselves. In the beginning, nobody knew about the concentration camps, at least I\ndon\u2019t know if they \u2014 that\u2019s what I hear, that they didn\u2019t know. I certainly was too\nyoung to know anything like that. But I don\u2019t know if my family knew about the\ncamps. I think that eventually it became clear that people who went never cameMarch 1, 2010\nback, and they \u2014 that there were these camps. But I just don\u2019t want to hear people\nsaying, why did they not fight back? I\u2019d like to see how they would feel if they were\nin that situation. Now of course, anybody can get a gun, and anybody, just about,\ncan defend themselves. But I don\u2019t know what would happen if that ever happened\nagain, I hope it never does, but y-you should never judge people if you have not\nbeen in that situation.",
        "Q: Are you a different person because of what you experienced?",
        "A: Yes. When I was still with my parents, even in the ghetto, I was not only \u2014 I was\nan only child. I was \u2014 trying to think of the right word, I was doted upon. My\nmother would feed me \u2014 first the nan \u2014 my nanny and then my mother would feed\nme til I was probably about seven or eight years old, because I didn\u2019t like to eat.\nAnd so there was always somebody taking care of me, I was really well taken care\nof. And because I was with my family, and with \u2014 with my parents, I didn\u2019t feel that\nI had to behave in any certain way. I don\u2019t know how I did behave, but I\u2019m sure I\ncould do whatever I really wanted, if 1t was safe. But when I left the ghetto, and I\nwas with strangers, I learned to be not only obedient, but not to annoy other people.\nAnd so I think that I became more tolerant of others. I think that I was spoiled when\nI was very young, but I didn\u2019t gr \u2014 but after that I didn\u2019t grow up very spoiled, I \u2014 I\nalways had to \u2014 when a child grows up like my children, for instance, if you are not\nMarch 1, 2010\nhappy about something, you let your parents know. Well, when they\u2019re not your\nparents, you\u2019re not going to let them know. And even \u2014 even with my aunt and\nuncle, who were certainly my closest family, but still, they were not my parents.\nAnd so, I was very careful most of my life, as to how I behaved. Now, other than\nthat, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I would have grown up to be a social worker. Probably not,\nif the war hadn't happened. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what would have happened, what\nkind of person I would have been, if the \u2014 the war hadn't happened. I would hope\nthat my war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about\nothers.",
        "Q: What about an inner strength, to cope with crises?",
        "A: Well, I haven\u2019t really made up my mind about that, because I\u2019ve had a number\nof crises in my life since the war. Health crisis, basically. And sometimes I think\nthat those \u2014 that when you have a lot of trauma in your life, that makes you\nstronger, but sometimes I think, might work the other way. And I haven\u2019t really\ncome to any conclusion on that, for myself. I think I am \u2014 I think with age you\nbecome stronger. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think most people will say that they\u2019re stronger than they\nwere when they were younger. I know I \u2014 I\u2014 I was much \u2014 not that I\u2019m a noisy\nperson, but I was more of a quiet, do what others want you to do person. I will standMarch 1, 2010\nup for myself more now. But that may be age. I don\u2019t know if it just makes \u2014 if it\u2019s\nmy experience.",
        "Q: Do you receive reparations?",
        "A: I got some, yes. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I did not want to. When I was in my 20s, my uncle\nsaid to me once \u2014 asked me if I wanted to apply for it, and m \u2014 I said, I don\u2019t want\nany money from Germany, they cannot repay me. And I didn\u2019t for the longest,\nlongest time, apply for anything. And then eventually, I did, and it \u2014 I did because I\n\u2014 it changed my view upon it. I thought then, will never repay me, but if my life can\nbe made a little better, maybe it\u2019ll help my children, then why not? Why should it\nstay there, I\u2019d rather have it here. And so the \u2014 ma \u2014 my son actually has done all \u2014\nanything that\u2019s been done, it\u2019s my older son has started that. He pushed me into\neverything that I have done on this \u2014 in this area, and that \u2014 that\u2019s about it, what\nhappened lately.",
        "Q: Do you dream about the war years?",
        "A: No. At least, I don\u2019t usually remember what I dream about, so it \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\nMaybe I do, but I \u2014 I honestly don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were you active in the civil rights movement, because what happened to the\nJews, being deprived of their civil rights?",
        "A: No. I mean, I certainly sympathize with them.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I wasn\u2019t active in it. I was very busy raising my family. I really \u2014 I felt\nterrible about all of \u2014 all of it, and \u2014 and wished everybody all \u2014 you know, to get all\ntheir rights, and everything. I always felt that way, but I would not say that I \u2014 I was\nan \u2014 active in it, no.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts about the Eichmann trial? Did that bring up any\nmemories for you?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t bring up memories, but I was certainly glad that they had gotten ahold\nof him, and \u2014 and whatever punishment was due, let \u2014 let that happen then. And I\u2019m\ncertainly upset about some of the people who have gotten away in \u2014 in Argentina\nor wherever they went. I think that that\u2019s a shame. I kind of feel that I was more\nimmersed in \u2014 in \u2014 with my family, and my work, rather than \u2014 I \u2014 I did not think\nabout it unless it came up on the news, or something like that.",
        "Q: Do you feel that lessons have been learned, the world has learned any lessons\nfrom this?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t. I \u2014 I think that \u2014 I thought so at first, for many years I did think so.\nBut now, looking around, I think people \u2014 there are those who will try to get rid of\nanybody who doesn\u2019t think their way, or who they don\u2019t like, or don\u2019t want to deal\nwith, and \u2014 an-and \u2014 and as far as Israel is concerned, I think it\u2019s \u2014 I can\u2019t doMarch 1, 2010\nanything about it, so I try not to be \u2014 la \u2014 I\u2019m really, really concerned and I just feel\nthat after everything is said and done, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019Il ever be peace. And\nthat \u2014 that\u2019s a very sore point with me, cause I feel that people who \u2014 who really\nbuilt the country from nothing, why shouldn\u2019t they finally have some peace? But \u2014\nand \u2014 and I suppose they do to a certain extent, but they\u2019re always under this siege,\nand I worry about Iran, and their nuclear bomb, and \u2014 but I think that Israel has to\njust \u2014 something, and maybe they will. I \u2014 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re just going to go\nquietly anywhere. So, I \u2014I feel that \u2014 I worry about it. I worry about everything\nthat\u2019s happening in the world. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just not a \u2014 not a peaceful time, and I\nworry about the future for my children, grandchildren, and really it\u2019s \u2014 I do.",
        "Q: Are you a member of any survivor groups?",
        "A: I was. I \u2014 for a number of years, I was part of the hidden children group in\nRockland county. It was a small group, and maybe there were 25 of us. And we\nused to meet on the weekly \u2014 on a monthly basis, and I found a lot of common\nground with \u2014 with \u2014 with them. They \u2014 they all \u2014 we were all more or less in the\nsame kind of \u2014 in the same page. And I\u2019m \u2014 so, sometimes I \u2014 I write to one or two\nof them, but that was a close group, and I really \u2014 that was from the Marriott hotel\nwe Started that, after that. However, when I came to the united \u2014 when I came to\nWashington area, there is a group, but it\u2019s a very, very large group. It\u2019s BaltimoreMarch 1, 2010\nand Washington hidden children. They had been a group for about 20 years, even\nbefore any of that. And I went to a couple of meetings, I really tried. But I\u2019m not\nterribly outgoing. Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem. And I didn\u2019t feel \u2014 they said\nthey welcomed me, but they were such a cl \u2014 such a close group, they knew all\nabout each other\u2019s background. They had a history, and the \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to get\ninto something that \u2014 and I \u2014 after a while I stopped going. So I don\u2019t belong to \u2014",
        "Q: Have you \u2014 have you been to the Holocaust Museum building?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts when you walk in there?",
        "A: Well, it was very \u2014 first time I \u2014 first of all, I went to the opening with Elie\nWiesel, and all that. And I will never, ever forget that, because that was extremely\nemotional for me. And I\u2014I cry easily anyway, but it was a \u2014 all my children came,\nand we were all there. It was the rainiest day possible, and I thought ... that\u2019s\nprobably the wrong thing to start talking about. I thought it must be the \u2014 the\nheavens coming down, crying.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: But anyway, I \u2014 I did go to that, and then I did go to the museum one time. And I\nthink it\u2019s extremely well put together. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a place that other people can comeMarch 1, 2010\nand see what \u2014 what was done. It was very realistic, and I was very emotional about\nit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Okay [indecipherable] okay.",
        "A: Did you want to put it on?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, we were talking about you \u2014 you going into the building itself, and the\nexhibits. Did you go upstairs to any of the exhibits when you went into the\nbuilding?",
        "A: Ye-Yes.",
        "Q: Now, I-I\u2019m not talking about the time of dedication now, obviously.",
        "A: No, I know. Oh, I \u2014 I did go through the \u2014",
        "Q: And that section on the Warsaw ghetto?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m \u2014 I \u2014 I went through the whole thing, I\u2019m \u2014 I \u2014 I think so.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay, so it didn\u2019t have particular \u2014",
        "A: But it was very \u2014 it was many years ago.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay, so you didn\u2019t have particular memories of going through the section\nof the Warsaw ghetto.",
        "A: Oh, I tell you the truth, tried to kind of go through. I d \u2014I didn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nhandle just \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.March 1, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 you know, taking every little \u2014 everything in. I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t. So I paced\nmyself rather quickly.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I went back 10 years later, to the rededication, or you know when they had that \u2014\nthe 10 year anniversary? And I felt \u2014 now that was a summer day, the sun was\nshining, and I was with my husband and my son. And I said, this is so much better.\nWe have gone through 10 years. And not that there has been healing, but I think\nwe're kind of past some of the things. And I just felt that it was almost like rebirth.\nThat\u2019s how I felt. It was just \u2014 the whole atmosphere was so much different than the\ndedication, which was just, I thought it was so very traumatic for me. I didn\u2019t know\nwhy really. I\u2014I\u2014I -\u2014TI just felt very traumatized. Not traumatized, but emotional\nabout it. And then when we came back, it was different, 10 years later. I\u2019m glad that\nit\u2019s there. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just good \u2014",
        "Q: Why are you glad?",
        "A: Because I think that, not so much for us who have survived, but \u2014 but for those\nwho ha \u2014 who didn\u2019t. They\u2019re not forgotten. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important. The\nroom with the shoes was just too much.March 1, 2010",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to say before we end the interview? Any\nthoughts that you have, any message to your grandchildren possibly, that you would\nwant to say to them?",
        "A: Be strong, follow your star. Don\u2019t forget what happened, but don\u2019t be burdened\nby it. You have to go on with your life, and make the Jewish people proud, which I\nknow you will. And I love you. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a beautiful note to end on.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry about all \u2014 I just \u2014 my \u2014 my children know me, and so when something\nemotional comes up, oh, here comes Mom. So, I\u2019m sorry about that, but I should\nhave brought a whole box of \u2014",
        "Q: Well, thank you \u2014",
        "A: I thought this was going to be a real dry interview.",

        "A: Yes. When I was still with my parents, even in the ghetto, I was not only \u2014 I was\nan only child. I was \u2014 trying to think of the right word, I was doted upon. My\nmother would feed me \u2014 first the nan \u2014 my nanny and then my mother would feed\nme til I was probably about seven or eight years old, because I didn\u2019t like to eat.\nAnd so there was always somebody taking care of me, I was really well taken care\nof. And because I was with my family, and with \u2014 with my parents, I didn\u2019t feel that\nI had to behave in any certain way. I don\u2019t know how I did behave, but I\u2019m sure I\ncould do whatever I really wanted, if 1t was safe. But when I left the ghetto, and I\nwas with strangers, I learned to be not only obedient, but not to annoy other people.\nAnd so I think that I became more tolerant of others. I think that I was spoiled when\nI was very young, but I didn\u2019t gr \u2014 but after that I didn\u2019t grow up very spoiled, I \u2014 I\nalways had to \u2014 when a child grows up like my children, for instance, if you are not\nMarch 1, 2010\nhappy about something, you let your parents know. Well, when they\u2019re not your\nparents, you\u2019re not going to let them know. And even \u2014 even with my aunt and\nuncle, who were certainly my closest family, but still, they were not my parents.\nAnd so, I was very careful most of my life, as to how I behaved. Now, other than\nthat, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I would have grown up to be a social worker. Probably not,\nif the war hadn't happened. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what would have happened, what\nkind of person I would have been, if the \u2014 the war hadn't happened. I would hope\nthat my war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about\nothers.",
        "A: Well, I haven\u2019t really made up my mind about that, because I\u2019ve had a number\nof crises in my life since the war. Health crisis, basically. And sometimes I think\nthat those \u2014 that when you have a lot of trauma in your life, that makes you\nstronger, but sometimes I think, might work the other way. And I haven\u2019t really\ncome to any conclusion on that, for myself. I think I am \u2014 I think with age you\nbecome stronger. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think most people will say that they\u2019re stronger than they\nwere when they were younger. I know I \u2014 I\u2014 I was much \u2014 not that I\u2019m a noisy\nperson, but I was more of a quiet, do what others want you to do person. I will standMarch 1, 2010\nup for myself more now. But that may be age. I don\u2019t know if it just makes \u2014 if it\u2019s\nmy experience.",
        "A: I got some, yes. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I did not want to. When I was in my 20s, my uncle\nsaid to me once \u2014 asked me if I wanted to apply for it, and m \u2014 I said, I don\u2019t want\nany money from Germany, they cannot repay me. And I didn\u2019t for the longest,\nlongest time, apply for anything. And then eventually, I did, and it \u2014 I did because I\n\u2014 it changed my view upon it. I thought then, will never repay me, but if my life can\nbe made a little better, maybe it\u2019ll help my children, then why not? Why should it\nstay there, I\u2019d rather have it here. And so the \u2014 ma \u2014 my son actually has done all \u2014\nanything that\u2019s been done, it\u2019s my older son has started that. He pushed me into\neverything that I have done on this \u2014 in this area, and that \u2014 that\u2019s about it, what\nhappened lately.",
        "A: No. At least, I don\u2019t usually remember what I dream about, so it \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\nMaybe I do, but I \u2014 I honestly don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No. I mean, I certainly sympathize with them.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: But I wasn\u2019t active in it. I was very busy raising my family. I really \u2014 I felt\nterrible about all of \u2014 all of it, and \u2014 and wished everybody all \u2014 you know, to get all\ntheir rights, and everything. I always felt that way, but I would not say that I \u2014 I was\nan \u2014 active in it, no.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t bring up memories, but I was certainly glad that they had gotten ahold\nof him, and \u2014 and whatever punishment was due, let \u2014 let that happen then. And I\u2019m\ncertainly upset about some of the people who have gotten away in \u2014 in Argentina\nor wherever they went. I think that that\u2019s a shame. I kind of feel that I was more\nimmersed in \u2014 in \u2014 with my family, and my work, rather than \u2014 I \u2014 I did not think\nabout it unless it came up on the news, or something like that.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t. I \u2014 I think that \u2014 I thought so at first, for many years I did think so.\nBut now, looking around, I think people \u2014 there are those who will try to get rid of\nanybody who doesn\u2019t think their way, or who they don\u2019t like, or don\u2019t want to deal\nwith, and \u2014 an-and \u2014 and as far as Israel is concerned, I think it\u2019s \u2014 I can\u2019t doMarch 1, 2010\nanything about it, so I try not to be \u2014 la \u2014 I\u2019m really, really concerned and I just feel\nthat after everything is said and done, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019Il ever be peace. And\nthat \u2014 that\u2019s a very sore point with me, cause I feel that people who \u2014 who really\nbuilt the country from nothing, why shouldn\u2019t they finally have some peace? But \u2014\nand \u2014 and I suppose they do to a certain extent, but they\u2019re always under this siege,\nand I worry about Iran, and their nuclear bomb, and \u2014 but I think that Israel has to\njust \u2014 something, and maybe they will. I \u2014 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re just going to go\nquietly anywhere. So, I \u2014I feel that \u2014 I worry about it. I worry about everything\nthat\u2019s happening in the world. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just not a \u2014 not a peaceful time, and I\nworry about the future for my children, grandchildren, and really it\u2019s \u2014 I do.",
        "A: I was. I \u2014 for a number of years, I was part of the hidden children group in\nRockland county. It was a small group, and maybe there were 25 of us. And we\nused to meet on the weekly \u2014 on a monthly basis, and I found a lot of common\nground with \u2014 with \u2014 with them. They \u2014 they all \u2014 we were all more or less in the\nsame kind of \u2014 in the same page. And I\u2019m \u2014 so, sometimes I \u2014 I write to one or two\nof them, but that was a close group, and I really \u2014 that was from the Marriott hotel\nwe Started that, after that. However, when I came to the united \u2014 when I came to\nWashington area, there is a group, but it\u2019s a very, very large group. It\u2019s BaltimoreMarch 1, 2010\nand Washington hidden children. They had been a group for about 20 years, even\nbefore any of that. And I went to a couple of meetings, I really tried. But I\u2019m not\nterribly outgoing. Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem. And I didn\u2019t feel \u2014 they said\nthey welcomed me, but they were such a cl \u2014 such a close group, they knew all\nabout each other\u2019s background. They had a history, and the \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to get\ninto something that \u2014 and I \u2014 after a while I stopped going. So I don\u2019t belong to \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it was very \u2014 first time I \u2014 first of all, I went to the opening with Elie\nWiesel, and all that. And I will never, ever forget that, because that was extremely\nemotional for me. And I\u2014I cry easily anyway, but it was a \u2014 all my children came,\nand we were all there. It was the rainiest day possible, and I thought ... that\u2019s\nprobably the wrong thing to start talking about. I thought it must be the \u2014 the\nheavens coming down, crying.",
        "A: But anyway, I \u2014 I did go to that, and then I did go to the museum one time. And I\nthink it\u2019s extremely well put together. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a place that other people can comeMarch 1, 2010\nand see what \u2014 what was done. It was very realistic, and I was very emotional about\nit.",
        "A: Did you want to put it on?",
        "A: Ye-Yes.",
        "A: No, I know. Oh, I \u2014 I did go through the \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m \u2014 I \u2014 I went through the whole thing, I\u2019m \u2014 I \u2014 I think so.",
        "A: But it was very \u2014 it was many years ago.",
        "A: Oh, I tell you the truth, tried to kind of go through. I d \u2014I didn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nhandle just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, taking every little \u2014 everything in. I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t. So I paced\nmyself rather quickly.",
        "A: I went back 10 years later, to the rededication, or you know when they had that \u2014\nthe 10 year anniversary? And I felt \u2014 now that was a summer day, the sun was\nshining, and I was with my husband and my son. And I said, this is so much better.\nWe have gone through 10 years. And not that there has been healing, but I think\nwe're kind of past some of the things. And I just felt that it was almost like rebirth.\nThat\u2019s how I felt. It was just \u2014 the whole atmosphere was so much different than the\ndedication, which was just, I thought it was so very traumatic for me. I didn\u2019t know\nwhy really. I\u2014I\u2014I -\u2014TI just felt very traumatized. Not traumatized, but emotional\nabout it. And then when we came back, it was different, 10 years later. I\u2019m glad that\nit\u2019s there. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just good \u2014",
        "A: Because I think that, not so much for us who have survived, but \u2014 but for those\nwho ha \u2014 who didn\u2019t. They\u2019re not forgotten. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important. The\nroom with the shoes was just too much.March 1, 2010",
        "A: Be strong, follow your star. Don\u2019t forget what happened, but don\u2019t be burdened\nby it. You have to go on with your life, and make the Jewish people proud, which I\nknow you will. And I love you. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry about all \u2014 I just \u2014 my \u2014 my children know me, and so when something\nemotional comes up, oh, here comes Mom. So, I\u2019m sorry about that, but I should\nhave brought a whole box of \u2014",
        "A: I thought this was going to be a real dry interview.",
