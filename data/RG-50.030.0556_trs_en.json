        "Q: Was your family religious?",
        "A: Well, my father went, you know, in \u2014 in Europe basically most people were\nreligious, at least that\u2019s what I was aware of.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: My father did go to temple, and prayed every morning and did go to temple on\nSaturdays. Of course, kept kosher. And I wasn\u2019t really aware of that much more of\nwhat religious meant; I thought all Jews were religious.",

        "A: I never started s \u2014",
        "Q: You never did.",
        "A: \u2014 I never went to school until after we were liberated. So basically, at that point I\nwas almost nine years old before I went to school, without knowing how to read or\nwrite.",
        "Q: So, when the war started, you \u2014 you were on the Soviet side, or you were on the\nPolish side?",
        "A: We were on the Polish side, and then the \u2014 the Soviets came in in \u2014I guess in\n1940, maybe, I think.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And tha \u2014 and of course, and then the Germans came in. The Soviets, we were a\nlittle bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to \u2014 my father was afraid that they\u2019d\ntake him to Russia, whatever. And we thought that maybe ca \u2014 jer \u2014 he thought that\nmaybe ki \u2014 when the Germans came in, they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren't going to harm\nPolish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. But of course we\ndiscovered very quickly otherwise. And after awhile, which I don\u2019t really remember\nhow long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the\nvillages and different neighborhoods \u2014 our house was in the ghetto. And many\npeople came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. Cause I remember\npeople basically dying, I don\u2019t know how long it took after the ghetto was forming,\nbut on our doorstep there would be dead people that have \u2014 from hunger, you know.\nAnd they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. And we\nbasically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my \u2014 my parents may have\nstored some food, so I don\u2019t remember being hungry at that point. Maybe I was too\nyoung to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti \u2014 akejas they call\nit, you know. The first one we \u2014 we had relatives outside of town, they \u2014 we went\nthere, to outside of town. My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather,\nwhen we came back, we discovered my father\u2019s father was killed, right across the\nstreet. He was shot right across the street from our house. And then the second one,\nwe went into hiding someplace outside of the city. But the third one, my father\nbrought us to a Christian family, and he \u2014 they said that all workers should come\nand register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register.\nAnd after a day or two, he will come and get us. And it took about a week and he\nnever came back. So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking\nout \u2014 out of the \u2014 their \u2014 wherever they hid us, in their barn. And they were shotti \u2014\nshooting after us, you know, when we \u2014 they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I\nguess. And we went back to our home, but eventually this akcja must have stopped,\nor whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. Out of the house.\nAnd I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab \u2014 she had a \u2014 her\ngirdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it \u2014 to take that. As a child I was able\nto sneak by with that. And this is basically \u2014 that eventually saved our life. And then\nthey made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father\u2019s\nside had survived, and then an aunt, my father\u2019s sister. And we went into the woods,\nand we \u2014 I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the\nKinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. And you \u2014 you were able to\nget there. So we were in the woods right acro \u2014 from the river, and hiding in there,\nand a young student came across. He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he\nsays, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will\ncome and \u2014 and take you across. He carried me across, because I was the youngest\none. My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across\nwith packages, if they had \u2014 whatever they had. And we came to a little town,\nPotok Zloty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made\nJudenfrei over there. And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a\nfamily that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there. And there were also many\nakcjas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching.\nAnd I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. And\nright after the akeja I\u2019d come out and they\u2019d say, the children are dead, they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re gone. Or \u2014 and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children,\nwith bleed \u2014 blood coming out of the \u2014 the wagon. You know, when \u2014 so I was\nalways ready, I was afraid I\u2019d be left behind, being the \u2014 the youngest one. So as\nsoon as they \u2014 I\u2019d be \u2014 at night or whatever, I\u2019d be the first one to get dressed and\nhold onto my mother to go into hiding. And basically after this \u2014 you know, after \u2014\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and\nmy \u2014 and we had an-another little town, my ki \u2014 father\u2019s relatives, cousins were\nthere, and they \u2014 I don\u2019t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided\nto go there. And we went to Kopyezynce was that name. And we went in \u2014 we\nstayed with them. And of course then it started over there; the \u2014 the killings started\nover there. And my f-\u2014 relatives\u2019 son, they \u2014 he was 17 or 18 years old, with other\nboys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we\nfelt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the\nbasement, and we were there. There were a couple of akcjas there, but this was like\nthe last one. We we \u2014 all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that\nwent in there. And they must \u2014 they built a air \u2014 you know, some type of air, to give\nus air in the street. And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we \u2014 that\nthere was a \u2014 that we \u2014 there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from\nthe other side the street and came in that side. And then they realized that there had\nto be an opening in a \u2014 in the house, you know, that we \u2014 how we got in there. So\nthey discovered us on both sides. They pulled everybody out, and they started\nthrowing hand grenades into the bunker. And basically, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker,\nwhatever. A \u2014 but I was holding onto my brother. And people died, and the dead\nbodies fell on top of us. And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you\nknow, the dead, to see what was there. And they hit my brother over the head with\nan axe, you know, to tr \u2014 they thought that he was still alive. But I was covered with\nbodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. And basically, I\nsurvived with that one shoe on, through the war. And then we \u2014 we \u2014 when \u2014 after\nwe were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or\nwhatever, they were all dead people. At night we snuck out of there, went into a \u2014\ninto another building, out onto a roof. We stayed there for a long time without any\nfood. Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my \u2014 my throat was\nclosing up from not eating or drinking. But there was like a \u2014 a \u2014 a rusty tub, or\nwhatever with the \u2014 with the water was leaking from the roof. And she found a\nstraw and made me drink the water with a st \u2014 through a straw, because it was\nfeathers and dirt in that water. And then we were discovered there. But if \u2014 they\nonly robbed us. There were some other people from the bunker that survived,\nanother three men, I think wi-with us. And \u2014 you know, and they let us \u2014 they \u2014\nthey told us, this is the end, they\u2019re gonna \u2014 going to keep killing until all the Jews\nare gone, he says. But there is a labor camp outside of \u2014 of \u2014 that some Jews are\nworking on the labor \u2014 in the labor camp outside of town. To us, of course, 1t was a\nstrange town, we weren\u2019t there very long. It was a ghetto \u2014 walled ghetto. But we \u2014\nthese two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a\nplace to go over the wall. And they found like an old couch or a chair, I don\u2019t know\nwhat it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. They threw me\nover the \u2014 th \u2014 over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto. And it\nwas \u2014 a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the \u2014 the gate, the Jews\nwere escaping, and they start \u2014 they shot after us. Well, we were able to get to \u2014 I\nthink one of the man got \u2014 you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the\nfields, and there was \u2014 the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of\ndays in \u2014 my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp\nwhere Jews were still working. We got there and we \u2014 we s \u2014 we got there at night\nand there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. They were always afraid\nthat at night they\u2019d come and get them. We were in a building that wasn\u2019t quite\nfinished yet. They came to rob us again, and they \u2014 my mother had \u2014 at this point\nshe had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and\nthey touched her boot that it was there. So they hit her to get off the boot and she\nrefused. She said, we\u2019ll scream. They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren\u2019t\nallowed to rob. So they got scared and ran away. And then morning came, and my\nmother went into the camp, into that labor camp and ta \u2014 find out if she could work\nthere. And the man that was in charge of labor \u2014 my mother happened to have been\na beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her \u2014 1n his\noffice. And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a\nPolish woman. So she says, but I have two children. So he said, two children, he\nsays, do you have a-\u2014 so she says, I have a son and a daughter. Says well, no son, I\ncannot help you with a son, but with a daughter. But a couple of days later he said\nto her, I\u20141f you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a\nfriend that would be willing to hide you outside into \u2014 in a \u2014 outside in another\nfarm. And my mother said she didn\u2019t \u2014 she was afraid to say that she had the money\nwith her. But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the\nghetto and dig it out. She wanted to make sure that he meant it. And sure enough, he\ndid have a friend, he sends a worker from that other farm to pick us up, you know,\nto \u2014 to take us \u2014 he wanted gold dollars, he didn\u2019t want \u2014 so we were very lucky to\nhave gold and not paper money. And they took us to this other f\u2014 to this other farm,\nor to \u2014 you know what \u2014 what it was, it was \u2014 was a lot of people working for him,\nhe was like the boss. And they put us in the room, they \u2014 1t was an empty building.\nAnd there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or\nwhatever. And he \u2014 the man didn\u2019t tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as\na \u2014 he was the bookkeeper on that farm. But he was a Jew, and he passed himself\noff as a\u2014 you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he\ncould. I mean, mostly it was potatoes. And being the youngest one after we were\nthere for eight months, and then they started \u2014 rumors were he ki \u2014 brought back\nrumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the\nwar, and they were coming closer. And the partisans were in the woods, we were\nhoping we\u2019d get liberated. But eventually, of course, the \u2014 the war came closer, and\nI think that they \u2014 that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in\nthere. So they moved us to a still. But the \u2014 and the still in \u2014 these big barrels in a\nstill, and \u2014 and then we went up to the \u2014 the roof, I don\u2019t \u2014 and they were going to\nbomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings\nbecause they didn\u2019t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there.\nAnd we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to\n[indecipherable]. And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away.\nAnd we didn\u2019t really know if we were \u2014 if the Russians were coming, if the rai \u2014 so\nwe stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they \u2014 they\ncouldn\u2019t bring it to us over there. Eventually they came and they told us you\u2019re\nliberated, you\u2019re free. And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet\nwere swollen. And we got outside and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as\nthey were advancing to the next town. And \u2014 and that town they were \u2014 some Jews\nstarted coming out of \u2014 you know, there were a couple of families came out of\nhiding, and we stayed there. So basically, that was our liberation. And then we\nstarted running because the war was going on right near us. We tried to go closer to\nthe Russian border. And other people were coming out of labor camps, and they had\ntyphus, and my mother and I both got typhus. And we \u2014 that part is completely like\nway \u2014 vague in my mind. I know that I couldn\u2019t walk, that I lost my hair. But I, you\nknow \u2014 and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our\nhometown, hoping that there would somebody be left, somebody would be \u2014 you\nknow, we didn\u2019t know what \u2014 the fate of my father, we just \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 knew that he didn\u2019t come back, and my mother\u2019s sisters, grandmothers,\neverybody. You know, so we came back to town and some Jews finally unfil \u2014 you\nknow, came back. Some of the Jews that \u2014 we stayed there for awhile, and that\u2019s\nwhen the first \u2014 when it got a little bit \u2014 they wanted the children to go to school \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 so that was my first experience to go to school. And it was a Polish school at\nthat point \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 but it was the Russians \u2014 within weeks they changed it to Russian school. And\nthen we ha \u2014 we \u2014 since we were Polish citizens, we \u2014 we were able to get \u2014 go to\nPoland, since this became Russia.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: And they got us onto trains, you know, we got into a train, you know, all the\nJews, and we were \u2014 went to Poland. And in Poland we were in Bytom, in a town\nBytom. And without having schooling, and I was \u2014 guess there was no food, my\nmother put us in an orphanage in \u2014 in Poland. I forgot the name of the town. But\nnext \u2014 ex \u2014 actually, the next [indecipherable] there wasn\u2019t much food in that\norphanage. The next town, and the next, it \u2014 we went to an orphanage in Zabrze,\nand the \u2014 and stayed there, but th-the funny part is, when I went to Houston, I \u2014\nsome people came and they were searching for people, they fa \u2014 had \u2014 had a picture\nof \u2014 when they didn\u2019t remember of why they were there \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 of what they were there, and I was in the picture with them. So actu \u2014 there\u2019s\none woman here, Ida from Chicago, who we found each other in Houston through\none of these meetings.",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: And there was another man, George Hoffman, he\u2019s not here today, we were in\nthat orphanage. And eventually we left, of course, for Germany. And I was in the\nDP camp in Bad Reichenhall in Germany. Went to a school as \u2014 there was Zionist\norganizations formed, I was really hoping as a \u2014 as a young child to go to Israel,\nyou know, I wanted to be \u2014 to be a soldier or whatever. But my mother put is in the\n\u2014 in the orphanage Preen(ph), which many children it was like a transit thing to go\nto the United States. So as the \u2014 of the orphans quota we \u2014 I came in 1949, I came\nto the United States, and was sent to Minneapolis as a foster child. And I lived\nwith a Jewish family until my mother came to the United States.",
        "Q: And was your brother with you, or \u2014",
        "A: My brother was with \u2014 with me all this time.",
        "Q: So you two were together the whole time.",
        "A: He was \u2014 together, thi \u2014 that time, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 we were all together at that point, just my brother and I.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There are a lot of people here that have been to Preen(ph) yeah, which was \u2014\nyes.",
        "Q: Right. Did you ever find out what happened to your father?",
        "A: Eventually, yes, a man in our hometown who survived, he was with my father in\nth \u2014 in that camp where they gathered them all when they discovered that it wasn\u2019t\nreally a work thing \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 that they were to register, but they were going to take them to concentration\ncamp. My father was 41 years old, a strong man, so he s \u2014 looked out the window\nand he saw two policemen, Ukrainian policemen that he went to school with. So he\nspoke to one of them and he said, I have two watches with me, I\u2019ll gladly give you\nmy watches, and I\u2019m gonna jump out the window. He didn't do it, but he pointed\nhim out to the next man, and as he was running out the window he was shot.",
        "Q: Did any of your other family survive?",
        "A: Basically, you know, my mother was one of seven sisters. I-I have one cousin.\nWe were \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, we were 19 cousins. Wa \u2014 one cousin survived, he\ns \u2014he lives in Florida now, too. And now my mother has died, my f \u2014 brother has\ndied, and I \u2014 I have my children, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I want to go back a little bit.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I guess this would probably be pre-war. What was the first thing you really \u2014\nwhat\u2019s the first memory you have as a child?",
        "A: Basically going visiting \u2014 to visit relatives. In the summertime going out to the\ncountry, and you know, all wonderful, wonderful memories, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah. And when the war started, I guess I\u2019m wondering \u2014",
        "A: I went also to pre-school at one point, and it was a Hebrew \u2014 it was a Hebrew, I\nguess, a Hebrew pre-school, and I was \u2014 the thing I remember is they taught us on\nthe blackboard, you know, they made like \u2014 and they said sus(ph), so they made a \u2014\na \u2014 you make a\u2014 a-\u2014 you make a circle, you make a \u2014 a straight, you know, a\u2014a\nline, and a little dot, and another circle. And that\u2019s sus(ph) and that means horse,\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the extent of my education.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a good \u2014 I like that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s great. Do you remember your mother \u2014 I-I guess I\u2019m just \u2014 you were such\na young child, what \u2014 I mean, that was only, really the only life you really knew for\na long time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember your mother just being \u2014 she sounds like a very strong\nwoman. Do you remember her just being terrified all the time? How were you \u2014 she\nwas always looking out for you and your brother.",
        "A: Always looking out for \u2014 for us and \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, fo \u2014",
        "Q: Did you get the impression that she was scared?",
        "A: [indecipherable] we were all scared \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 we were all scared, so I\u2019m really not sure where the fear came out of, but the\nfear was constant, you know, that\u2019s constant, of being discovered, of being you\nknow, seen, of being left behind, of being killed, you know.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In fact we \u2014 in that Buezacz, in the town where I had seen these dead children on\nthe wagon \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 there were some relatives of ours that were there too, and they had a baby. You\nknow, they had \u2014 had a baby. And right after one of these akcjas my mother sent\nme and my brother there, to see if they\u2019ve survived, and when we came in there,\ntheir baby was in the crib, de-dead in the crib, shot in the crib. You know, so that\u2019s\nconstantly fearing that I was youngest one, that maybe, you know \u2014 you also heard\nthat parents ran away, left their young children. They wouldn\u2019t let them into a\nbunker, because you may cry. In Buczacz we were in bunker, there was a baby that\ncried at us, we \u2014 they were searching and we heard them. The mother put a pillow\nover him, and he died. It was a baby of \u2014 six weeks old baby. Was \u2014 was \u2014 you\nknow, choked right there in that bunker.

You know, I read \u2014 the teacher didn\u2019t discover that I didn\u2019t know any\nSpanish, probably for weeks. She just thought I was very \u2014 I read very well, better\nthan the American children, because I \u2014 it\u2019s the way you \u2014 phonetically.",

        "A: I never really got to liking New York. I mean, of course I di \u2014 eventually, we\nlived in the Bronx and I had children and everything. But I was very happy when I\n\u2014 when we moved away. We moved away to \u2014 first to Rutland county, and\neventually we, for many years we lived in Poughkeepsie, New York. I was very\nhappy outside of \u2014 I also didn\u2019t mingle that much with \u2014 because there weren\u2019t that\nmany survivors, you know, my husband was American, so I didn\u2019t mingle that\nmuch with, you know \u2014 but I was happy, I blended \u2014 I thought I blended in, I\u2014 In \u2014\nI never admit it. If they didn\u2019t ask me, I never said I was a survivor unless they\nasked me.",

        "A: What \u2014",
        "Q: You know, that\u2019s always \u2014 always one \u2014 something I \u2014 I wonder about 1s, how\ndid you explain it to people when they did ask, who didn\u2019t know about it,\nnecessarily?",
        "A: People knew, but I \u2014 I basically never told my children never told my husband.\nThis is \u2014 today 1s the first time that I\u2019m ready to speak about it. I\u2014 when they called\nme from Spielberg, when they would come to town, three times I cancelled my\nappointment. I never \u2014 I still don\u2019t feel very comfortable, and my children know it.\nThey\u2019ve never asked, because they felt it was painful for me. But now I have one of\n\u2014 little grandson, who \u2014 he lives in Houston. He \u2014 I think his parents came back of\nseeing a movie about the Holocaust, and th \u2014 we discussed it, and he realized that it\nwas me. So since then he\u2019s been prodding me, when can you tell me the story? I\nalways tell him, not today, hi \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 not today, some other time. And every\ntime I come to town, or he comes, he says, I \u2014 is \u2014 1s this the time yet? And I always\nsay not yet \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 the time is not yet. In fact, I remember going to a Seder one time, and\none of the young \u2014 the \u2014 asked me, knowing that I was a survivor, asked me some\nquestions, and I \u2014 and I told him a couple of things that had happened to me, and\nmy husband sat there and he was amazed that he had never \u2014 after many years being\nmarried, he had never heard this from me. And he also never questioned me of what\nI went through. My mother did a little talking, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and she spoke to my children too, but I \u2014",

But I think my brother was a little bit more\naffected by it, whatever. He was a little depressed, he was \u2014 he got married, he had\na family, but he definitely had a lot of the syndromes that I see in survivors. He was\n\u2014 he was four years older than I was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was definitely, I felt, more affected by it. In fact, I don\u2019t even like when\npeople, you know, whatever is wrong with me, when people thi \u2014 say, you know,\noh, it must be due to the Holocaust, I don\u2019t like to \u2014",

        "A: Rena Koch.",
        "A: My father owned a textile store, my mother was with him in the business, and we\nhad the housekeeper at home. And I had an older brother, who was four \u2014 four years\nolder than I was, and we \u2014 basically, she took care of us at home.",
        "A: Well, my father went, you know, in \u2014 in Europe basically most people were\nreligious, at least that\u2019s what I was aware of.",
        "A: My father did go to temple, and prayed every morning and did go to temple on\nSaturdays. Of course, kept kosher. And I wasn\u2019t really aware of that much more of\nwhat religious meant; I thought all Jews were religious.",
        "A: Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of life and I felt that that\u2019s the way it has to\nbe.",
        "A: I never started s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I never went to school until after we were liberated. So basically, at that point I\nwas almost nine years old before I went to school, without knowing how to read or\nwrite.",
        "A: We were on the Polish side, and then the \u2014 the Soviets came in in \u2014I guess in\n1940, maybe, I think.",
        "A: And tha \u2014 and of course, and then the Germans came in. The Soviets, we were a\nlittle bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to \u2014 my father was afraid that they\u2019d\ntake him to Russia, whatever. And we thought that maybe ca \u2014 jer \u2014 he thought that\nmaybe ki \u2014 when the Germans came in, they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren't going to harm\nPolish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in Germany. But of course we\ndiscovered very quickly otherwise. And after awhile, which I don\u2019t really remember\nhow long, they formed a ghetto in my hometown, and everybody from all the\nvillages and different neighborhoods \u2014 our house was in the ghetto. And many\npeople came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation. Cause I remember\npeople basically dying, I don\u2019t know how long it took after the ghetto was forming,\nbut on our doorstep there would be dead people that have \u2014 from hunger, you know.\nAnd they were looking in garbage cans for potato peels or onion peels. And we\nbasically, since we were in our hometown, I imagine my \u2014 my parents may have\nstored some food, so I don\u2019t remember being hungry at that point. Maybe I was too\nyoung to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti \u2014 akejas they call\nit, you know. The first one we \u2014 we had relatives outside of town, they \u2014 we went\nthere, to outside of town. My father, I think, remained in town, but my grandfather,\nwhen we came back, we discovered my father\u2019s father was killed, right across the\nstreet. He was shot right across the street from our house. And then the second one,\nwe went into hiding someplace outside of the city. But the third one, my father\nbrought us to a Christian family, and he \u2014 they said that all workers should come\nand register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register.\nAnd after a day or two, he will come and get us. And it took about a week and he\nnever came back. So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking\nout \u2014 out of the \u2014 their \u2014 wherever they hid us, in their barn. And they were shotti \u2014\nshooting after us, you know, when we \u2014 they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I\nguess. And we went back to our home, but eventually this akcja must have stopped,\nor whatever, but they came into our house and they chased us out. Out of the house.\nAnd I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab \u2014 she had a \u2014 her\ngirdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it \u2014 to take that. As a child I was able\nto sneak by with that. And this is basically \u2014 that eventually saved our life. And then\nthey made Judenfrei, our town was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father\u2019s\nside had survived, and then an aunt, my father\u2019s sister. And we went into the woods,\nand we \u2014 I guess my mother must have known that across this river, was called the\nKinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there. And you \u2014 you were able to\nget there. So we were in the woods right acro \u2014 from the river, and hiding in there,\nand a young student came across. He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he\nsays, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will\ncome and \u2014 and take you across. He carried me across, because I was the youngest\none. My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across\nwith packages, if they had \u2014 whatever they had. And we came to a little town,\nPotok Zloty, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made\nJudenfrei over there. And we went on to Buczacz, and in Buczacz we lived with a\nfamily that was in the ghetto, there was a ghetto there. And there were also many\nakcjas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching.\nAnd I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children. And\nright after the akeja I\u2019d come out and they\u2019d say, the children are dead, they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re gone. Or \u2014 and one day I came out and I saw a wagon full of dead children,\nwith bleed \u2014 blood coming out of the \u2014 the wagon. You know, when \u2014 so I was\nalways ready, I was afraid I\u2019d be left behind, being the \u2014 the youngest one. So as\nsoon as they \u2014 I\u2019d be \u2014 at night or whatever, I\u2019d be the first one to get dressed and\nhold onto my mother to go into hiding. And basically after this \u2014 you know, after \u2014\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of how much time passed, they made that town Judenfrei, and\nmy \u2014 and we had an-another little town, my ki \u2014 father\u2019s relatives, cousins were\nthere, and they \u2014 I don\u2019t how they communicated with my mother, but she decided\nto go there. And we went to Kopyezynce was that name. And we went in \u2014 we\nstayed with them. And of course then it started over there; the \u2014 the killings started\nover there. And my f-\u2014 relatives\u2019 son, they \u2014 he was 17 or 18 years old, with other\nboys they built a bunker from that house that we lived in to under the street, and we\nfelt it was very safe, you know, in the basement it was camouflaged, in the\nbasement, and we were there. There were a couple of akcjas there, but this was like\nthe last one. We we \u2014 all went into this bunker, we were 30 some odd people that\nwent in there. And they must \u2014 they built a air \u2014 you know, some type of air, to give\nus air in the street. And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we \u2014 that\nthere was a \u2014 that we \u2014 there was a bunker under there, so they started digging from\nthe other side the street and came in that side. And then they realized that there had\nto be an opening in a \u2014 in the house, you know, that we \u2014 how we got in there. So\nthey discovered us on both sides. They pulled everybody out, and they started\nthrowing hand grenades into the bunker. And basically, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the bunker,\nwhatever. A \u2014 but I was holding onto my brother. And people died, and the dead\nbodies fell on top of us. And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you\nknow, the dead, to see what was there. And they hit my brother over the head with\nan axe, you know, to tr \u2014 they thought that he was still alive. But I was covered with\nbodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe. And basically, I\nsurvived with that one shoe on, through the war. And then we \u2014 we \u2014 when \u2014 after\nwe were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or\nwhatever, they were all dead people. At night we snuck out of there, went into a \u2014\ninto another building, out onto a roof. We stayed there for a long time without any\nfood. Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my \u2014 my throat was\nclosing up from not eating or drinking. But there was like a \u2014 a \u2014 a rusty tub, or\nwhatever with the \u2014 with the water was leaking from the roof. And she found a\nstraw and made me drink the water with a st \u2014 through a straw, because it was\nfeathers and dirt in that water. And then we were discovered there. But if \u2014 they\nonly robbed us. There were some other people from the bunker that survived,\nanother three men, I think wi-with us. And \u2014 you know, and they let us \u2014 they \u2014\nthey told us, this is the end, they\u2019re gonna \u2014 going to keep killing until all the Jews\nare gone, he says. But there is a labor camp outside of \u2014 of \u2014 that some Jews are\nworking on the labor \u2014 in the labor camp outside of town. To us, of course, 1t was a\nstrange town, we weren\u2019t there very long. It was a ghetto \u2014 walled ghetto. But we \u2014\nthese two men that were with us on that roof came down with us and looked for a\nplace to go over the wall. And they found like an old couch or a chair, I don\u2019t know\nwhat it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over. They threw me\nover the \u2014 th \u2014 over the fence, and we started running away from the ghetto. And it\nwas \u2014 a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the \u2014 the gate, the Jews\nwere escaping, and they start \u2014 they shot after us. Well, we were able to get to \u2014 I\nthink one of the man got \u2014 you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the\nfields, and there was \u2014 the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of\ndays in \u2014 my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that labor camp\nwhere Jews were still working. We got there and we \u2014 we s \u2014 we got there at night\nand there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night. They were always afraid\nthat at night they\u2019d come and get them. We were in a building that wasn\u2019t quite\nfinished yet. They came to rob us again, and they \u2014 my mother had \u2014 at this point\nshe had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and\nthey touched her boot that it was there. So they hit her to get off the boot and she\nrefused. She said, we\u2019ll scream. They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren\u2019t\nallowed to rob. So they got scared and ran away. And then morning came, and my\nmother went into the camp, into that labor camp and ta \u2014 find out if she could work\nthere. And the man that was in charge of labor \u2014 my mother happened to have been\na beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the floor in her \u2014 1n his\noffice. And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a\nPolish woman. So she says, but I have two children. So he said, two children, he\nsays, do you have a-\u2014 so she says, I have a son and a daughter. Says well, no son, I\ncannot help you with a son, but with a daughter. But a couple of days later he said\nto her, I\u20141f you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a\nfriend that would be willing to hide you outside into \u2014 in a \u2014 outside in another\nfarm. And my mother said she didn\u2019t \u2014 she was afraid to say that she had the money\nwith her. But she said, I have money in the ghetto, and I will sneak back in the\nghetto and dig it out. She wanted to make sure that he meant it. And sure enough, he\ndid have a friend, he sends a worker from that other farm to pick us up, you know,\nto \u2014 to take us \u2014 he wanted gold dollars, he didn\u2019t want \u2014 so we were very lucky to\nhave gold and not paper money. And they took us to this other f\u2014 to this other farm,\nor to \u2014 you know what \u2014 what it was, it was \u2014 was a lot of people working for him,\nhe was like the boss. And they put us in the room, they \u2014 1t was an empty building.\nAnd there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or\nwhatever. And he \u2014 the man didn\u2019t tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as\na \u2014 he was the bookkeeper on that farm. But he was a Jew, and he passed himself\noff as a\u2014 you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he\ncould. I mean, mostly it was potatoes. And being the youngest one after we were\nthere for eight months, and then they started \u2014 rumors were he ki \u2014 brought back\nrumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the\nwar, and they were coming closer. And the partisans were in the woods, we were\nhoping we\u2019d get liberated. But eventually, of course, the \u2014 the war came closer, and\nI think that they \u2014 that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in\nthere. So they moved us to a still. But the \u2014 and the still in \u2014 these big barrels in a\nstill, and \u2014 and then we went up to the \u2014 the roof, I don\u2019t \u2014 and they were going to\nbomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that buildings\nbecause they didn\u2019t want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there.\nAnd we heard them talking outside, you know, that this is next, they were going to\n[indecipherable]. And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away.\nAnd we didn\u2019t really know if we were \u2014 if the Russians were coming, if the rai \u2014 so\nwe stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they \u2014 they\ncouldn\u2019t bring it to us over there. Eventually they came and they told us you\u2019re\nliberated, you\u2019re free. And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet\nwere swollen. And we got outside and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as\nthey were advancing to the next town. And \u2014 and that town they were \u2014 some Jews\nstarted coming out of \u2014 you know, there were a couple of families came out of\nhiding, and we stayed there. So basically, that was our liberation. And then we\nstarted running because the war was going on right near us. We tried to go closer to\nthe Russian border. And other people were coming out of labor camps, and they had\ntyphus, and my mother and I both got typhus. And we \u2014 that part is completely like\nway \u2014 vague in my mind. I know that I couldn\u2019t walk, that I lost my hair. But I, you\nknow \u2014 and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our\nhometown, hoping that there would somebody be left, somebody would be \u2014 you\nknow, we didn\u2019t know what \u2014 the fate of my father, we just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 knew that he didn\u2019t come back, and my mother\u2019s sisters, grandmothers,\neverybody. You know, so we came back to town and some Jews finally unfil \u2014 you\nknow, came back. Some of the Jews that \u2014 we stayed there for awhile, and that\u2019s\nwhen the first \u2014 when it got a little bit \u2014 they wanted the children to go to school \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so that was my first experience to go to school. And it was a Polish school at\nthat point \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but it was the Russians \u2014 within weeks they changed it to Russian school. And\nthen we ha \u2014 we \u2014 since we were Polish citizens, we \u2014 we were able to get \u2014 go to\nPoland, since this became Russia.",
        "A: And they got us onto trains, you know, we got into a train, you know, all the\nJews, and we were \u2014 went to Poland. And in Poland we were in Bytom, in a town\nBytom. And without having schooling, and I was \u2014 guess there was no food, my\nmother put us in an orphanage in \u2014 in Poland. I forgot the name of the town. But\nnext \u2014 ex \u2014 actually, the next [indecipherable] there wasn\u2019t much food in that\norphanage. The next town, and the next, it \u2014 we went to an orphanage in Zabrze,\nand the \u2014 and stayed there, but th-the funny part is, when I went to Houston, I \u2014\nsome people came and they were searching for people, they fa \u2014 had \u2014 had a picture\nof \u2014 when they didn\u2019t remember of why they were there \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of what they were there, and I was in the picture with them. So actu \u2014 there\u2019s\none woman here, Ida from Chicago, who we found each other in Houston through\none of these meetings.",
        "A: And there was another man, George Hoffman, he\u2019s not here today, we were in\nthat orphanage. And eventually we left, of course, for Germany. And I was in the\nDP camp in Bad Reichenhall in Germany. Went to a school as \u2014 there was Zionist\norganizations formed, I was really hoping as a \u2014 as a young child to go to Israel,\nyou know, I wanted to be \u2014 to be a soldier or whatever. But my mother put is in the\n\u2014 in the orphanage Preen(ph), which many children it was like a transit thing to go\nto the United States. So as the \u2014 of the orphans quota we \u2014 I came in 1949, I came\nto the United States, and was sent to Minneapolis as a foster child. And I lived\nwith a Jewish family until my mother came to the United States.",
        "A: My brother was with \u2014 with me all this time.",
        "A: He was \u2014 together, thi \u2014 that time, yeah \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we were all together at that point, just my brother and I.",
        "A: There are a lot of people here that have been to Preen(ph) yeah, which was \u2014\nyes.",
        "A: Eventually, yes, a man in our hometown who survived, he was with my father in\nth \u2014 in that camp where they gathered them all when they discovered that it wasn\u2019t\nreally a work thing \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that they were to register, but they were going to take them to concentration\ncamp. My father was 41 years old, a strong man, so he s \u2014 looked out the window\nand he saw two policemen, Ukrainian policemen that he went to school with. So he\nspoke to one of them and he said, I have two watches with me, I\u2019ll gladly give you\nmy watches, and I\u2019m gonna jump out the window. He didn't do it, but he pointed\nhim out to the next man, and as he was running out the window he was shot.",
        "A: Basically, you know, my mother was one of seven sisters. I-I have one cousin.\nWe were \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, we were 19 cousins. Wa \u2014 one cousin survived, he\ns \u2014he lives in Florida now, too. And now my mother has died, my f \u2014 brother has\ndied, and I \u2014 I have my children, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Basically going visiting \u2014 to visit relatives. In the summertime going out to the\ncountry, and you know, all wonderful, wonderful memories, you know.",
        "A: I went also to pre-school at one point, and it was a Hebrew \u2014 it was a Hebrew, I\nguess, a Hebrew pre-school, and I was \u2014 the thing I remember is they taught us on\nthe blackboard, you know, they made like \u2014 and they said sus(ph), so they made a \u2014\na \u2014 you make a\u2014 a-\u2014 you make a circle, you make a \u2014 a straight, you know, a\u2014a\nline, and a little dot, and another circle. And that\u2019s sus(ph) and that means horse,\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the extent of my education.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Always looking out for \u2014 for us and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, fo \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] we were all scared \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we were all scared, so I\u2019m really not sure where the fear came out of, but the\nfear was constant, you know, that\u2019s constant, of being discovered, of being you\nknow, seen, of being left behind, of being killed, you know.",
        "A: In fact we \u2014 in that Buezacz, in the town where I had seen these dead children on\nthe wagon \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 there were some relatives of ours that were there too, and they had a baby. You\nknow, they had \u2014 had a baby. And right after one of these akcjas my mother sent\nme and my brother there, to see if they\u2019ve survived, and when we came in there,\ntheir baby was in the crib, de-dead in the crib, shot in the crib. You know, so that\u2019s\nconstantly fearing that I was youngest one, that maybe, you know \u2014 you also heard\nthat parents ran away, left their young children. They wouldn\u2019t let them into a\nbunker, because you may cry. In Buczacz we were in bunker, there was a baby that\ncried at us, we \u2014 they were searching and we heard them. The mother put a pillow\nover him, and he died. It was a baby of \u2014 six weeks old baby. Was \u2014 was \u2014 you\nknow, choked right there in that bunker. You know, so it was always that fear of,\nyou know, of that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, this 1s so very strange that I don\u2019t have \u2014 I was just speaking\nto a friend of mine who\u2019s also \u2014 who 1s my age. She interviewed yesterday and she\nsaid, I don\u2019t remember, did I miss my mother, father, my sisters? She says, how did\nI feel? I feel the same way, did I really? All I remember is years later, you know, if I\nwas angry at my mother I was \u2014 always felt my father\u2019s gonna come, he\u2019s gonna\ncome back. You know, an-and for many years actually, I was already an adult, I \u2014\nknowing already that he had been killed, I always thought maybe it was wrong, he\u2019s\ngonna come back.",
        "A: Fa-Fa-Family in Minneapolis.",
        "A: They did it mostly for money, it wasn\u2019t, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they were in great need, or whatever, but they took \u2014we\nwere not the first set of foster children that they had taken in from this \u2014 I \u2014 I think\nit was the group, the Joint or the HIAS, or whoever, sent us there. When we got to\nNew York, actually, they asked us if we had any family in the United States, if we\nwanted to stay; we had nobody.",
        "A: So I\u2014 and it was very, very hot. I came from Germany in a wool outfit with\nwool socks, and it was like 98 degrees and humid, I had never experienced humidity\nbefore. And I said, just send us away, as far away from New York as possible. So\nthey sent us to Minneapolis.",
        "A: I\u2014 Polish and Yiddish.",
        "A: And yeah, of course I understood maybe German, you know, wa \u2014 this is part of,\nyou know \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And no English \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no English at all. And I remember going with my foster mother to the\nsupermarket. As a child I must have been learning very quickly. And a man\napproached and asked me something, and I understood, and she was so excited that\nI understood what he asked me.",
        "A: Yiddish \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 probably Yiddish, yes. I think Yiddish.",
        "A: I have this friend of mine here and I said, you know, who \u2014 I know her from the\nDP camp. And I said, what language did we speak? She says, Russian. I says, I di \u2014\nnever spoke Russian, so you couldn\u2019t have been speaking to me in Russian. So we\nm \u2014 stis \u2014 we discovered it must have been Yiddish too, that we spoke to each other,\nbut I thought we spoke Polish, you know, or whatever.",
        "A: I started going to school \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 of course they made \u2014 advanced pretty quickly. They put me in \u2014 in\nMinneapol \u2014 of course, I went to \u2014 in the DP camp, I went to school in DP camp.\nAnd that was a \u2014 really an accelerated course. So when I got to Minneapolis, I\nthink it was sixth or seventh grade that they put me in immediately. I\u2019m not sure of\nhow well I did, but I was there. But coming back then later, when my mother\narrived and we came back to New York, I went into ninth grade in junior high\nschool.",
        "A: And there was a Jewish teacher and he must have been very \u2014 and I remember\nwriting for Thanksgiving, it was my first Thanksgiving in the u\u2014 you know, maybe\nsecond Thanksgiving \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in the United States. And I wrote my story in my broken English or whatever,\nbut he praised me so much, it gave me so much courage. He thought that I did so\nwell, you know, of what I was thankful for.",
        "A: Very, very hard, you know.",
        "A: Every ti \u2014 culture shock. Every time they call on you in class \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or they put me in the \u2014 and this was in the Bronx, there was a\u2014 everybody was\ntaking Spanish at that point. I had never heard Spanish before, but they handed me a\nbook. And of course, reading was very easy because it\u2019s the same as you would\nPolish. You know, I read \u2014 the teacher didn\u2019t discover that I didn\u2019t know any\nSpanish, probably for weeks. She just thought I was very \u2014 I read very well, better\nthan the American children, because I \u2014 it\u2019s the way you \u2014 phonetically.",
        "A: It was so easy for me.",
        "A: And then I went on \u2014 then I went on to, you know, into high school, in Taft High\nSchool in the Bronx. But I got married, of course, very young. I was 17 years old\nwhen I got married.",
        "A: I needed a dental for \u2014 for school. They wouldn\u2019t give me \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 you\nhad to go \u2014 you know, you wouldn\u2019t get a grade in gym, unless you got a dental. So\nI went \u2014 my mother took me along to a dentist, and he spoke Yiddish, and that\u2019s\nwhy my mother, of course, chose him.",
        "A: And he was a young man, and he said, if \u2014 I'll only give you a dental if you\u2019 ll\nmeet my cousin. And this was his cousin, and eventually I married him.",
        "A: I never really got to liking New York. I mean, of course I di \u2014 eventually, we\nlived in the Bronx and I had children and everything. But I was very happy when I\n\u2014 when we moved away. We moved away to \u2014 first to Rutland county, and\neventually we, for many years we lived in Poughkeepsie, New York. I was very\nhappy outside of \u2014 I also didn\u2019t mingle that much with \u2014 because there weren\u2019t that\nmany survivors, you know, my husband was American, so I didn\u2019t mingle that\nmuch with, you know \u2014 but I was happy, I blended \u2014 I thought I blended in, I\u2014 In \u2014\nI never admit it. If they didn\u2019t ask me, I never said I was a survivor unless they\nasked me.",
        "A: What \u2014",
        "A: People knew, but I \u2014 I basically never told my children never told my husband.\nThis is \u2014 today 1s the first time that I\u2019m ready to speak about it. I\u2014 when they called\nme from Spielberg, when they would come to town, three times I cancelled my\nappointment. I never \u2014 I still don\u2019t feel very comfortable, and my children know it.\nThey\u2019ve never asked, because they felt it was painful for me. But now I have one of\n\u2014 little grandson, who \u2014 he lives in Houston. He \u2014 I think his parents came back of\nseeing a movie about the Holocaust, and th \u2014 we discussed it, and he realized that it\nwas me. So since then he\u2019s been prodding me, when can you tell me the story? I\nalways tell him, not today, hi \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 not today, some other time. And every\ntime I come to town, or he comes, he says, I \u2014 is \u2014 1s this the time yet? And I always\nsay not yet \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 the time is not yet. In fact, I remember going to a Seder one time, and\none of the young \u2014 the \u2014 asked me, knowing that I was a survivor, asked me some\nquestions, and I \u2014 and I told him a couple of things that had happened to me, and\nmy husband sat there and he was amazed that he had never \u2014 after many years being\nmarried, he had never heard this from me. And he also never questioned me of what\nI went through. My mother did a little talking, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and she spoke to my children too, but I \u2014",
        "A: My brother \u2014 my bro \u2014 no, we never spoke about it. The two of us to \u2014 to \u2014 to\neach other, we never spoke about it. But I think my brother was a little bit more\naffected by it, whatever. He was a little depressed, he was \u2014 he got married, he had\na family, but he definitely had a lot of the syndromes that I see in survivors. He was\n\u2014 he was four years older than I was.",
        "A: He was definitely, I felt, more affected by it. In fact, I don\u2019t even like when\npeople, you know, whatever is wrong with me, when people thi \u2014 say, you know,\noh, it must be due to the Holocaust, I don\u2019t like to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 blame this on the Holocaust.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes, they \u2014 to this day I get, you know, and I\u2019m amazed that after\nmany years, you know, I find myself running, or you know, or \u2014 or shooting, yes, I\n\u2014I do. The nightmares have never really stopped.",
        "A: To go or to hide or whatever, yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, every time, every time we would get settled as a child, you know, if\nwe had a room, I was, in my little ways, I would take a \u2014 a kerchief and cover the\ntable, I wanted it to be ours, you know. Like to set the table, to do something to\ndecorate it, to make it ours, because we never \u2014 never experienced that, definitely.\nEvery place that \u2014 1f we stayed for long period \u2014 a longer period of time, eva \u2014 I\nwanted this to be my home, definitely.",
        "A: Well, once we started running, it wasn\u2019t really \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t really \u2014",
        "A:\u2014Ican\u2019t tell the time, I can\u2019t tell the time.",
        "A: I know that, you know, over \u2014 from 1942, basically to the last month \u2014 to the \u2014 to\nthe \u2014 we were liberated in March, the end of March of 1940 \u2014 \u201944.",
        "A: So we were in all these places, but I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know of how long in each\nplace, I really can\u2019t tell.",
        "A: I never had a toy \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 never had a toy. Never had \u2014 basically, most times we didn\u2019t have a s \u2014 didn\u2019t\nhave a pencil. And so when we were hidden, you know, my mother tried to, you\nknow, take a straw and try to, like do something with me, or \u2014 or teach me numbers,\nyou know, talk to me about numbers. I never learned the alphabet, of course, until\nafter we were liberated, or learned to read. But she tried to \u2014 numbers, you know,\naddition, subtraction.",
        "A: She tried even the multiplication tables, you know, to teach me. This was all\nbecause most of the time, nothing. I never had \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2019ve never been back to that part of Poland",
        "A: I\u2019ve been back to Warsaw, but I\u2014 Warsaw was not a \u2014 you know, for me, no\nmeaning, it\u2019s just because I took a tour, and it went through \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Warsaw, I was there.",
        "A: I would like to go back, I just would like to s \u2014 you know. But it\u2019s the Ukraine\nright now \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s not easy, whatever else \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but there are people from my hometown in Israel who said at one point they\nwere going to make a trip, and I said that I would love to go to. But I don\u2019t think it\never happened. They may have gone individually, but that\u2019s never happened.",
        "A: Well, I-",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: I\u2014 yes, my mother \u2014 my father\u2019s cousin, whose family \u2014 whose son had built a\nbunker for us, his family at that point got killed too, and he was with us, and he\u2019s\nthe one probably that helped us jump over that fence \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or to ma \u2014 he was hidden, and eventually my mother married him, after the\nwar, my mother married my \u2014 married him. And he was a first cousin of my\nfather\u2019s.",
