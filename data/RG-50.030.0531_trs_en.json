        "Question: \u2014 and interview with Mr. Tracy Strong, Jr., conducted by Peggy\nFrankston of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for the Rivesaltes\nInternment Camp Memorial Museum on July \u2014 on June 11\", 2009, in Washington,\nD.C. Thank you for coming today Mr. Strong.",
        "Answer: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Q: Could you introduce yourself and tell us a little about yourself please?",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m tra \u2014 Tracy Strong, born in Seattle, Washington, September 4\",\n1915, and grew up there. My father had moved to Seattle in 1910 to join the Seattle\nYMCA as a Boys\u2019 Worker. So we spent the first 12 years at \u2014 in Seattle on Queen\nAnne Hill. Eventually moved up on the boulevard in Queen Anne Hill and built a\nhouse looking out over Lake Union. My bra \u2014 I have a older brother Robbins, and a\nyounger sister Ruth, and we enjoyed a very pleasant gro \u2014 time at growing up in\nSeattle; it wasn\u2019t quite as crowded as it is now. The house we built is \u2014 in fact, I\njust heard from the lady who lives there, she bought it from my father in 1923, and\nhas lived in it ever since. So the house remained the same. We had a normal\nchildhood, my father was always off toa YMCA camp. And summers we\u2019d join\nhim in the camp, so we spent a very pleasant time in Seattle. Then in 1923 my\nJune 11, 2009\nfather was appointed to the Boys\u2019 Work secretary for the world\u2019s YMCA in\nGeneva, Switzerland, so the family all packed up. I was five, my sister was seven\nor eight, and my brother was 10 or 11. And my father indicated that if we\u2019re going\nto work in a world\u2019s organization, he should see something of the Orient. So we\nsailed out of Seattle in November 1923 on the \u2014 one of the princess ships, and went,\nactually, practically all the way around the world in six months. As I think back on\nthat, must \u2014 and have traveled with my own children, here were three young\nchildren and my mother taking care of us all the way around the world. We went\nfirst to Japan, and got there just after the big earthquake in Japan in 1923. Then\nM-Moncton(ph), Manchuria, China, Hong Kong. Then around through India, up\nthrough the Suez Canal, went over to Palestine, and eventually to Venice, an-and\narrived in Geneva in April 1924. Which was quite a trip. So we settled into\nGeneva, which was then a much smaller town that it is now, but also a very\ninternational town, because a lot of international organizations were there, including\nthe international Red Cross, and then many of the other youth-serving or people-\nserving organizations.",
        "Q: Where did you go to school?",
        "A: Oh, we started out in the public school, across the street [indecipherable] where\nwe had to learn French 1n a hurry if we wanted to play. We children picked up\nJune 11, 2009\nFrench very quickly, my folks never did, so we asked them not to speak French\nwhen we were, cause their accent was so poor. Anyway, they went there, went to\ninternational school for a year or so, and eventually came back to this country for\ntwo ye \u2014 my father thought I should learn English, so I came back for two years to a\nhigh school in Bainbridge Islands, Washington, and finished high school there.\nThen I was 16, at which time I felt I was a little too young for college, and as he and\nmy mother were traveling a great deal for the y \u2014 world\u2019s YMCA, I went to school\nin Germany, Deutsche Jugend \u2014 Jugendhof, which was 1932. And if you\nremember your history well, that was the time that Hitler came to power, in 1933.\nSo I went through that whole time of the change in regime and cha \u2014 and heard\nHitler speak twice, big rallies. And then at the end of the year, went back to Ohio \u2014\nOberlin College, Ohio, where I spent four years and got my bachelor\u2019s degree,\n1937. At that time I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I wanted to do, a chance of working in\nthe YMCA, or in the church. So I went to Yale Divinity School for three years in\nNew Haven, Connecticut. In 19 grad \u2014 got my da\u2014 my master\u2019s degree in divinity\nand it was in 1940, first war had already started in Europe, and my father had\nheaded up the war \u2014 war prisoner\u2019s aid of the YMCA, which was approved in the\nGeneva Convention, that international Red Cross took care of the physical\nproblems of the prisoners on ev-every country, and the YMCA took care of their\nJune 11, 2009\nspiritual and intellectual problems, physical problems. So, my father was the head\nof this organization, but he \u2014 with headquarters in Geneva, although \u2014 and Geneva\nwas still open then. 1940, of course, the \u2014 France fell. In just a few weeks,\nblitzkrieg [indecipherable] Germans. I did \u2014",
        "Q: When did \u2014 did you go back to Germany?",
        "A: I went back to \u2014 actually to ge \u2014 headed for Geneva. Had to take a boat from\nNew York to Lisbon, then across Spain where we got \u2014 just at the time France had\nfallen, so everything was closed down, so we were stuck in Barcelona for several\nweeks. And then eventually the group went across southern France and up the\nRhone Valley to Geneva. And went originally to work with the European Student\nRelief fund, which was an organization made up of the three student serving\norganizations. The World Student Christian Federation, the Protestants. The Pax\nRomana, the Catholics, NISS, a neutral organization. And our job was to do for stu\n\u2014 university students what the YMCA was doing for the general population. So we\nsingled out students in camps in every country. I did go to Germany for about six\nmonths, to work in the prisoner of war camp, and visited Stalag 16, I think it was,\nand 17, one section of Germany. The ma \u2014 most of the prisoners were either\nFrench or British, Polish. A few ru \u2014 quite a few Russians eventually, which now\nJune 11, 2009\nbecause Russia did not sign the Geneva Convention, we could not get into the\ncamps to visit them.",
        "Q: What were some of your activities in the camps with the prisoners of war?",
        "A: Mainly with the YMCA and the \u2014 and the European Student Relief Fund, the\nESRF, it\u2019s called, for them I was ju \u2014 identify students, and try and get books,\nmaterial to them, so they continue their studies. See, in the camps, particularly the\nofficers\u2019 camps, the officers were not allowed to work. They had nothing to do\nexcept organize activities. So the YMCA brought in books, sporting material,\nviolins, anything to keep them occupied during their imprisonment. So I\u2019d go the \u2014\nthere were about, I suppose, 15 camps that I visited off and on in the fall of 1941.\nEventually \u2014 course, America wasn\u2019t in the war yet, but in 1941 I went back to\nGeneva. The Germans would not let me go in the camps any more, they thought I\nhad helped a prisoner escape, which was the last thing in the world I would have\ndone. So the Germans went and closed the camps to me. So \u2014",
        "Q: So you went back to Geneva.",
        "A: So I went back to Geneva. [interruption] So I went in the \u2014 must have been\nabout March I left Germany, went to Geneva, where headquarters were for the\nASRF, and \u2014 and by this time there were camps set up in southern France. See,\nwhen the Germans took France, everybody in northern France went to the south,\nJune 11, 2009\nto get away the rapid advance. The Germans kind of overran everybody, but then,\nas you recall, it divided France into occupied and unoccupied France, with the\noccupied being headquarters in Marseilles and Vichy. The Vichy government was\nset up in \u2014 in Vichy under General P\u00e9tain, Laval, which put the Germans very\nmuch in control. But at least they didn\u2019t \u2014 were not interfering in southern \u2014 in oro \u2014\nunoccupied France.",
        "Q: Tell me, who sent you to France? Did Donald Lowrie?",
        "A: No, Donald Lowrie was the head of the YMCA organization in southern\nFrance.",
        "Q: He was based where?",
        "A: He was based in Marseilles [indecipherable] and \u2014 and the \u2014 our \u2014 our student\norganization worked with the YMCA, or under the YMCA because they had access\nto the camps.",
        "Q: So did he ask you do come from Geneva to \u2014",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t so much his asking, he \u2014 he was in France, and we were \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 my or \u2014 organization, the European Student Relief Fund wanted somebody to\ncoordinate things for students only, in southern France, so I \u2014 and the entry was\nthrough the YMCA. So I went, being sent by the European Student Relief Fund, be\nworking with the YMCA.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: You s \u2014 mentioned traveling with Everett Melby, was he part of the European\nStudent Relief Fund too?",
        "A: Yes, he was one of the secretaries.",
        "Q: Who was person who decided what your mission was? Was there someone\nabove you?",
        "A: Yes, there is. A-Andr\u00e9 de Bionay was the head of the organization, was hired\nby the three religious groups, or student groups that had formed the organization. So\nI was responsible to him, but my activities were pretty much up to me, what I could\ndo with \u2014 to help students in southern France.",
        "Q: Who funded you?",
        "A: The European Student Relief Fund.",
        "Q: Because you seem to have a lot of tra \u2014 you seemed to travel a lot.",
        "A: I did. That was part of my job, to travel from camp to camp and help set up the\n[indecipherable] or the biblioth\u00e9ques, in the various camps.",
        "Q: And your specific mission was intellectual support, and something else too?",
        "A: Spiritual, phy \u2014 whatever physical support we could give. You know, I\u2019m sure\nmainly, my main job was to identify students and see what we could do to either get\nthem out of the camps, or to get them material to study with. Wasn\u2019t too happy with\nstudents staying in the camps, cause conditions were hardly conducive towards\nJune 11, 2009\nintellectual study. And there were all students that either started on a career in their\nhome country, whether it was Poland or Germany, Romania, Lithuania.",
        "Q: Did you become friendly with some of them?",
        "A: Oh, very much so, and \u2014",
        "Q: Can you remember some of their names?",
        "A: Well, the one I remember the best wa-was Hans Solomon, who \u2014 we stayed\nfriends, so I still correspond with him. Edgar Druenhoot(ph), Hans Mayer(ph).",
        "Q: Palos(ph)?",
        "A: Palos(ph), and \u2014",
        "Q: And what about some of the artists? You mentioned providing equipment for the\nartists.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you remember some of their names?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any of their names, but I still have one or two paintings that\nthey did.",
        "Q: Did you purchase them?",
        "A: We purchased them in a way that \u2014 or they were donated. So \u2014 and we set up\nexhibitions for them so they could be sold.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: And what about some of the other artistic activities, they play \u2014 did they play\nmusical instruments?",
        "A: Yes, well, we were able to provide violins, cellos, guitars. Usually had a piano in\nthe camp. So they would set up small musical groups, depending on the activities,\nand depending on the interest, depending on the health, because the condition in the\ncamps weren\u2019t really conducive to any intellectual work.",
        "Q: You mentioned the Russian choir in your diary? Do you remember meeting a\ngroup of Russians?",
        "A: I remember very vaguely that a group of Russians \u2014 they were mainly though\nRussians who\u2019d left Russia during the revolution. So they were what you call the\nwhite Russians, who had settled in Paris, with a large colony of them in Paris, and\nwith the rest of the French they left the north and came south. So my work was\nprimarily centered in Marseilles, I lived at the Hotel Terminus, and then we\u2019d\ntravel regularly to different camps.",
        "Q: You mentioned traveling with Donald Lowrie, can you talk a little about\nLowrie? He sounded as if he were an interesting person.",
        "A: Very interesting, very active, one of these what do you call it? A-type persons.\nVery outgoing, charming wife, who did all the driving for Donald. And Donald had\nworked in Czechoslovakia with the Czechs, the Czech YMCA, and\nJune 11, 2009\n[indecipherable] Czech, and so had a very special place in his heart for the Czechs.\nAny Czech student came by, always got some help. But Don was also the head of\nwhat they called the Nimes committee, which was a committee of all the various\nprivate organizations: the Red Cross; Unitarian; Quakers; OSE, Jewish\norganization. And they met once a month in Nimes, so it became known as the\nNimes committee, to coordinate their efforts, and then to intervene. And Don would\ngo to Vichy to talk to the representatives of the government in Vichy about\npermission to do certain things.",
        "Q: For example?",
        "A: Well, one thing that happened was be able to get the refugees out of the camps,\nif they could support themselves, so that Vichy government did finally approve that.\nWhereas if an organization would provide for them so the state didn\u2019t pay anything,\nthey could get them out of the camps, or a prisoner of private means could get out\nof the camps.",
        "Q: Do you remember going to Vichy with him?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go to Vichy, I went to Nimes regularly, to the Nimes committee.",
        "Q: Did you actively participate in the Nimes committee?",
        "A: Yes, I was representing the student relief fund and \u2014 but the c-committee wa \u2014 it\nwas a very [indecipherable] very worthwhile, very interesting committee, because\nJune 11, 2009\npeople of various interests \u2014 the Red Cross, of course, was mainly interested in\nproviding food, and the Swiss Red Cross particularly, took care of a lot of children,\nwhereas some of the other organizations were providing just intellectual or spiritual\nhelp.",
        "Q: Do you remember some of the people from the Jewish organizations? Did you\nremember Raoul \u2014 Raymond-Raoul Lambert?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say that I do remember them. I met them all, of course, and knew\nthem, but that\u2019s a long time ago.",
        "Q: At one point you mention that the Vichy government creates a \u2014 an official state\norganization for all Jewish organizations, Ugeef(ph), u-g-i-f. And \u2014 and you\nmention in your diary that Raymond-Raoul Lambert was supposed to be the\ngeneral secretary and he refused. Do you have any recollection of that?",
        "A: Not really in any detail.",
        "Q: And you also speak about meeting Dr. Markeen(ph) on a \u2014 on a train. He was a\ndoctor who with OSE. Do you remember him?",
        "A: A Swiss doctor, I think. I just by chance met him because I travel a good deal,\nand meet a lot of people.",
        "Q: And do you remember some of the memorable sessions of the Nimes\ncommittee? Were there certain times when it became animated?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Oh, it always was animated, because everybody there was an intellectual when \u2014\nvery di-different interests, but they all [indecipherable] in their own interests, and \u2014\nbut willing to cooperate. I remember especially one session where Lowrie asked for\na criticism of the committee, or recommendation, what we could do to improve, and\nit was very open, everybody put in their two cents worth, but very \u2014 very open\ndiscussion. Praise for Lowrie as president, because his was a difficult job to bring\nthem together, and get them to work together and go in one voice to Vichy. Vichy\nwas not too cooperative. I think Vichy was not thought of very much by the French\nthemselves. They knew it was under the control of the Germans, that P\u00e9tain, Laval\nhad very little of independence.",
        "Q: You worked with other organizations like the Cimade, and \u2014",
        "A: Met [indecipherable] Cimade.",
        "Q: Right. Can you tell me a little bit about the Cimade?",
        "A: Well, the Cimade was set up by the French, what they call a fede \u2014 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\ndes \u00e9tudiants, a Protestant organization under Marc Boegner, who was head of the\nProtestant church in France, which 1s, of course, very much a minority in f \u2014 in\nFrance. And Cimade [speaks French].",
        "Q: And who was \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: And Mada \u2014 Madame Baro(ph), a very active lady who \u2014 she was probably in\nher 30s and was the head of it [indecipherable] Vesfal(ph), Dumas, some of the\nnames of people. And they would put students into the camps to set up a foyer with\nthe YMCA and with the European Student Relief Fund. So they had it in most of\nthe camps, not all of them, but Gurs and Rivesaltes, Les Milles,\nthey had students living in the camps, running the foyer and organizing various\nactivities for the internees.",
        "Q: Who is the person who was living in Rivesaltes?",
        "A: Andre Dumas was one, Madame [indecipherable] was another. And they\nchanged from time to time.",
        "Q: What about \u2014 who was Mademoiselle Ugand(ph), and Mademoiselle Sen(ph)?\nWere they in with the Cimade, or were they with another organization?",
        "A: I think they were with Swiss Red Cross, which was a big or-organization.",
        "Q: At one point you talk about traveling with Lowrie and getting a 1 \u2014a lot done,\nand you reflect on the fact that you seem to get more done in a week with Mr.\nLowrie than the five months that preceded. And why was that?",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 well, he was a very active person, and had connections all over\nsouthern France, and had lived in France, of course, before, so he knew the\nFrench. He was able to get the functionaires(ph) to listen to him and do what he\nJune 11, 2009\nwanted. But he had that knack of approaching them and not \u2014 not challenging them\nreally, but getting them to listen to him, and then he never asked for more than he\nthought he could get, in getting permissions from the camps. And he couldn\u2019t do\nanything really to change the camps, but he could call to attention any discrepancies\nor any errors, or anything that were happening in the camps. And he had a very\npersuasive approach to the people, and very friendly always.",
        "Q: I noticed that you had all sorts of authorization forms, travel, laisser-passer, you\nhad \u2014 had driver\u2019s license, you had all sorts of identity cards, and \u2014",
        "A: Also had all kind of food cards. See, ev-everything was rationed.",
        "Q: Who ga \u2014 who issued your food cards?",
        "A: Who would what?",
        "Q: Who gave them to you, was it \u2014",
        "A: The government. Everybody in France had to have coupons for bread, or for\nmeat. For instance, we got, I think enough meat for a month to make one good\nhamburger. So, was very little meat. There\u2019s a big difference between Germany\nand France, and of course Germany was taking all the food, except the fruits.\nFrance was a very rich agricultural country, of course, especially in the south, a lot\nof fruits and vegetables, so we survived pretty much on [indecipherable] and \u2014\n[indecipherable] and asparagus. But you had to have coupons for those. As I recall\nJune 11, 2009\none \u2014 one of the wives who [indecipherable] committee, Madame Lagalle(ph)\nwent to spend four hours at the market, and just got one [indecipherable] which\nwas not a great deal, but 1t was better than nothing. So the \u2014 it seemed that food was\nvery much the central part of our lives. And we were much better off, of course,\nthan those in the camps who were getting very little food. But you could always eat\nwell and \u2014 depending what part of France you were in. When I went to\n[indecipherable] which is another story, and there there was plenty of food.",
        "Q: Or when you went back to Switzerland.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I went back to Switzerland regularly. I would gain \u2014 go back to\nSwitzerland, gain five pounds and lose it the next time I went to France.",
        "Q: You also worked with the Quakers.",
        "A: Yes, Ross McClellan.",
        "Q: Tell me about Ross McClellan, a little.",
        "A: Very pleasant person, very outgoing. Both he and his wife were very dedicated\npeople, good Quakers. A big \u2014 big fella, he was very imposing, which helped him a\ngreat deal.",
        "Q: You speak in the beginning of your diary in the year 1941 about your arrival,\nand a couple days after your arrival in Marseilles, you witnessed something that the\nQuakers were doing, and it was food distribution.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Oh, I think there was food that was being brought in by a ship, and the Quakers\nwere distributing it. Mainly milk and flour.",
        "Q: How \u2014 how did that work?",
        "A: As long as food \u2014 the ships came in, it worked very well, but then the Germans\nstopped it. There weren\u2019t any more food being sent in from abroad, so \u2014",
        "Q: Who was entitled to the \u2014 the food they brought?",
        "A: Any children. It was mainly a-an attempt to improve the diet of the children in\nFrance, not just refugees, but all \u2014 all childrens. So distribution was throughout all\nof southern France.",
        "Q: I remember you talking about setting up the [indecipherable] in Rivesaltes, and\napparently there was a theater there, and you mentioned about \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, we had built a \u2014 in the foyer, one end of the foyer, a stage, which\nbecame the theater, and \u2014",
        "Q: And did you put on shows there?",
        "A: Put on shows, plays, or musical events. Held church there.",
        "Q: Did you go for services regularly, at \u2014",
        "A: On Sundays, yes. Were very interesting groups, cause there\u2019d be maybe six or\nseven Germans, I mean, five or six Spanish, a couple of Poles. Three or four French\npeople. So it\u2019s conducted either in German or \u2014 or French.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: Did you preach?",
        "A: Once in awhile.",
        "Q: In what language?",
        "A: In French.",
        "Q: How did that go?",
        "A: Oh, it depends on the Sunday. Went off pretty well, because half the people\ncould understand French, most of them could understand a little French, but the\naudience was very mixed. So preaching or talking to them is \u2014 any distraction wa \u2014\nand anything di-different that was going on was \u2014 I mean, in a \u2014 not only\ninterrupted the service, but I remember one time when I was preaching, I don\u2019t have\nno idea what it was on, and this Spanish lady down in the front had her baby with\nher. About halfway through she began to nurse him, which for a young, 25 year old\nwas \u2014 it was surprise.",
        "Q: It distracted you.",
        "A: Some distraction, yeah.",
        "Q: You also mentioned Bible study groups.",
        "A: Right. The Cimade was very big on Bible studies. It was very much a\nintellectual approach to the Bible. And of course, everybody was invited to come,\nnot \u2014 not just the refugees, but any other French people who were there. That was\nJune 11, 2009\none way of keeping the organization central in their beliefs and in their ideas, and a\nch-chance for exchange it as personal ideas, too.",
        "Q: You mentioned the fact that the French seemed very \u2014 their priorities seemed to\nbe evangelization and theoretical Protestantism and ideas, whereas you wanted to\ndo social work. Could you elaborate on that a little, please?",
        "A: Oh, I think the difference between our two cultures, I mean the \u2014 the church in\nthe United States is a \u2014 at least the mainline churches have always had a very social\ngospel impact, where they felt that more than just religious ideas, but they should\nalso do something for people. Whether it was healthcare, or whether improve foods,\nor take care of people in prisons, whereas the French were much more intellectual\nin their approach, and \u2014 and the French loved to discuss, and to talk, a-argue \u2014 very\npleasantly, but also very intellectually, and I find \u2014 I found that they were way\nahead of us as far \u2014 intellectually as different ideas, which, even though I\u2019d had\ntheological training, I was not ready to discuss in such detail as the French were.",
        "Q: Was it stimulating for you?",
        "A: Very stimulating. And after awhile it got little \u2014 not boring, but it got \u2014 because\nthey never seemed to finish their discussion. They\u2019d go on and stop in the middle of\na sentence, and everybody knew what they were thinking, so you didn\u2019t have to say\nanything, which was a very typical French approach to it. I enjoy \u2014 had very good\nJune 11, 2009\nrelations with all the memb \u2014 we have, every six months maybe, a big retreat of all\nthe workers, in \u2014 in the Cimade, that is. [indecipherable] in the [indecipherable].\nGo up for just three or four days of just relaxation and discussions.",
        "Q: Skung too?",
        "A: And skiing.",
        "Q: Did you try skiing there?",
        "A: Oh, I started skiing as a boy in Switzerland when I was 10 years old, so I loved\nto ski. Given it up now though, I haven\u2019t skied for 30 years.",
        "Q: There was a man you mentioned who was in Rivesaltes, and then he was\ntransferred to [indecipherable]. His name was Mr. Kaufman. Do you remember?\nHe was about 63, and \u2014",
        "A: I remember he was trying to get out, like most refugees to \u2014 to the west, either to\nAmerica or South America or anyplace out of France.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember whether \u2014 I think he probably eventually made it,\nalthough our \u2014 our job \u2014 there was certain organizations that were specializing, like\nthe Unitarians, and the Jewish organization specialized in immigration, both \u2014 I wi\n\u2014Ican say it now, both legal and illegal. If they could get the permits to leave\nFrance, they had to have permits to get into Spain. And if they couldn\u2019t get them,\nJune 11, 2009\nthey would have students who\u2019d take them over the border, over the Pyrenees, or\ninto Switzerland. We had a number of students who were able to get into\nSwitzerland, like Hans Solomon and his five friends made it once into\nSwitzerland, got into the Valais, which is southern part of Switzerland, and were\nstopped at the Swiss border by the Swiss guards who were from that area, given a\nnice, big bowl of soup, and then sent back into France, cause Switzerland said\nthey just can\u2019t take everybody who wants to come to Switzerland.",
        "Q: So what happened?",
        "A: Eventually \u2014 eventually they got back into Rivesaltes, and then we arranged for\nthem to ge \u2014 try again, and not to go into the Valais, which was much stricter than \u2014\nthan say Geneva or Vaud. And eventually made it across, and we had visas \u2014 visas\nfor them, so that this time there\u2019s no problem.",
        "Q: To go from France into Switzerland?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you arranged for that?",
        "A: We did, through the organization, yes.",
        "Q: The European \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Eur-European student, or through the Cimade. Cimade was very good at that, it\nwas one of their jobs, and they had young students who were acting as guides across\nthe mountains, so \u2014",
        "Q: Was \u2014 were you in contact with Garel, the Garel rescue network? They were\nworking with the Jewish organization OSE. They also brought children into\nSwitzerland. Were you in contact with them?",
        "A: Very vaguely. Not \u2014 I\u2019d say we were not specializing in immigration \u2014 or\nemigration, but you couldn\u2019t help get involved in it.",
        "Q: You mentioned that many of the students come to see you, and some of them are\nviolinists, or they want to study medicine. And in your diary you seem to advise\nthem to learn a trade, a handicraft, so they can make a living, and they seem\nreluctant to do so. Do you remember anything \u2014 what you were thinking at that\npoint about \u2014",
        "A: I think 1t was more of a practical approach to know that they \u2014 you wanted them\nto continue their studies, but that took a [indecipherable], a place to live and steady\nincome, which we co \u2014 we could not provide, I mean, we couldn\u2019t provide. We\ngave out very little money, as far as help, just in emergencies. And that was true of\nmost of the organizations, they tried not to just hand out money. But I thought, so if\nJune 11, 2009\nI recommend that they learn a trade, at least they can earn a living. What we did \u2014\nthe story of the Chambon is another, different story.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about that?",
        "A: Yeah, in ni \u2014 at the end of \u201941, we fi \u2014 figure that the students \u2014 we wanted to do\nsomething for the students, and there was a committee of the ESRF in France with\nProfessor Lagalle(ph) from \u2014 from Montpellier, who was the head of the\ncommittee \u2014 French committee. And we figured we had to get the students into an\natmosphere where they could really continue their studies. We looked over southern\nFrance, and a Mr. Guillome(ph) who was a \u2014 worked for the \u2014 a Frenchman who\nworked for the YMCA, been mayor of a little town Chambon-sur-Lignon\n[indecipherable] and so we went up to see Chambon, which is very up in the\nmountains, and a very rural area, and found out that they had a treme \u2014 there are\ntwo pastors there, Pastor Truckmay(ph) and Pastor try \u2014 Tise(ph), who are very\nmuch the leaders of the community, and they had already had a number of maison\nd\u2019enfants open at the Swiss Red Cross, that a couple may \u2014 where they could bring\nchildren and take care of them during that \u2014 in that manner. And the main difference\nbetween Chambon et \u2014 the whole area, the plateau and gau \u2014 and southern France\non the coast, was there was plenty of food there. For the first time in I don\u2019t know\nhow many months, I found butter. That sh \u2014 one ra \u2014 thing that struck me, I would\nJune 11, 2009\nsay made the decision that we should try and settle a\u2014 a home there was, Melby\nand I were looking for a hotel, or for a place where we could \u2014 for a place we could\nrent to put students into. We \u2014 and we [indecipherable] the hotel overnight, went\nout in the morning. And the people next to us had had [indecipherable] breakfast\nsent up, and they put it out in the hall, and there were two pound \u2014 two pat\u00e9s of\nbutter left on the plate, so Melby and I immediately scooped it up and decided this\nis where we wanted to be. So we did find a Maison des Roches, which the hotel,\nwe were able to rent it and then had to staff it with a director and somebody could\nrun the place.",
        "Q: And who did you finally find?",
        "A: There was a miss \u2014 miss \u2014 Madame Pon-Pontay(ph), I think the names were.\nAnd then eventually Daniel Truckmay(ph), the nephew of one of the pastors took\nover. And over the year which we were in operation, there were about 75 different\nstudents who were able to take advantage of \u2014 most of them would \u2014 would come\nsettle down, or they would decide to try to go to Switzerland, or disappear into the\nMaquis, the resi \u2014 resistance. So it was, from that point of view, very successful,\nand we were able to, as I say, get about 75 students out of the camps, because this is\none thing the go-government, or the Nimes committee had pushed for was Vichy,\nget people out of the camps, and into a more or less normal living.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: Chambon is also a Protestant village.",
        "A: Chambon was very definitely a Protestant village.",
        "Q: And that may have influenced your choice?",
        "A: I think that [indecipherable] was a Protestant village, the whole area was\nProtestant, had been since the seven \u2014 15\", 16\" century, with the Huguenots. But\nthe fact that there were the two pastors here who were very supportive of our work,\nand are able to supervise the \u2014 the Maison des Roches.",
        "Q: I want to go back to Rivesaltes a little.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember the commander \u2014 commander of the camp, Commandant\nHubert(ph), did you ever meet with him?",
        "A: I did, but not a great deal, I didn\u2019t have that much to do with him. I \u2014 I know 0 \u2014\nI meet all the commanders, cause you had to call, and then when you first went to\nthe camp, then you go in and just let them know you\u2019re here.",
        "Q: Every time you went to a camp, did you have to have an authorization by the\nprefect?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: For every trip?",
        "A: Every trip. [indecipherable] stopping the prefecture and getting a permit.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: At one point you seemed to say, oh, the secretary\u2019s signature will do. Didn\u2019t you\nget to be a little more cavalier as time went on?",
        "A: I suppose after you\u2019ve been through the same thing and asked for the same kind\nof paper, you get s \u2014 you get accepted, and \u2014",
        "Q: Who was Mr. Froenial(ph)? You mentioned a messie \u2014 Mr. Froenial(ph) and he\nseems to be connected to the [indecipherable]. Was he a deputy director?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall. That\u2019s a long time ago.",
        "Q: I know. At one point you come back to Rivesaltes, and in your diary you\nmention that you are appalled by the state, the health of the \u2014 of the people. Could\nyou elaborate on that a little, please?",
        "A: I\u2014I re \u2014 of course, the conditions in the camp were always very mini \u2014\nminimum, and I think this was towards the end of \u2014 or in \u201942, where the conditions\n\u2014 the camp, you know, was on a beach, and the conditions around it weren\u2019t too\ngreat. Cold and windy and this particular time when I come back, I go and visit\npeople in the c \u2014 in the [indecipherable] or in the barracks. And \u2014 and th-this time I\nwent to the barracks, cause you could \u2014 they had a real black market going on in\nevery barrack, where if you wanted something special and you had money, you\ncould get it. In other words chocolate, or extra bread or something. But this time I\ncame back and people just looked worn out and tired and hungry, of course. And\nJune 11, 2009\nthey\u2019d \u2014 and they\u2019d lost any desire to do any we \u2014 or activities were very minimum\nbecause nobody had the strength to go to the foyer or read, or to play an instrument.\nAnd the men, particularly, were just starving away. And there was not a thing we\ncould do except just encourage them to try and make some plans, which was very\ndifficult, I mean, plan what their life, I mean, have a goal of some kind. And they\nwould just kind of pull the blankets up over them and just lie there. So those are\nconditions that, I don\u2019t know what anybody could have done to improve them\n[indecipherable] cause the food was [indecipherable], vegetables, nothing very\nsubstantial, it\u2019s one piece of bread, which made a very de \u2014 very depressing visit.",
        "Q: Sometimes you stayed several days in the camp.",
        "A: I\u2014 usually I\u2019d try and spend \u2014",
        "Q: You had a bag to sleep in?",
        "A: Yes, I slept \u2014 well, the Cimade personnel were sleeping in \u2014 in one of the\nbarracks, had their own rooms, so I had a guest room I could \u2014 could stay when I\nwas there.",
        "Q: Can you describe it, what they looked like inside?",
        "A: Small, little cupboard, not much of anything. They were not fancy.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 what were the conditions \u2014",
        "A: No \u2014no ra\u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: \u2014 cold, hot?",
        "A: Both. One or the other. It\u2019s either very cold, or else the wind was blowing and it\nwas \u2014 there was a breeze, and it was a hot wind. But the \u2014 no ru \u2014 no running water.\nThe toilet facilities were all army centered, built on the \u2014 up above the ground, and\ntwo holes in the ground. We did have our own \u2014 we had a key to one of th-their\nfacilities that were lined up, about six or seven holes, and entrance to each one, and\nwe had a key to one of the place we could use.",
        "Q: Was it reserved for the Cimade personnel?",
        "A: Cima \u2014 Cimade, all the personnel, whether Red Cross or others. So conditions in\ncamps \u2014 Rivesaltes was particularly depressing because of the heat, and the \u2014 not\nsand, but kind of rock \u2014 rocky soil. And overcrowded, of course. And then you\nnever knew when there\u2019s gonna be another exodus, or \u2014 then the Germans insisted\nthat the Germans \u2014 the Germans in the camp be sent back to Germany. It was kind\nof an interesting way in which \u2014 I suppose about a hundred thousand Germans were\nsent to France, cause Hitler gave the \u2014 the gauleiter, that is the heads of certain\nsections of Germany permission to just do what they wanted besides just get rid of\nthe Jews. So the one near the French border in southwestern Germany, so it\u2019s\nsimple, we\u2019ll just send them to France. So they shipped them all down to France,\nto Gurs, Rivesaltes, other camps. And then a year or so later they wanted them\nJune 11, 2009\nback. That\u2019s when the convoys started. Those pictures you saw were of a convoy\nbeing prepared, which was always a very dramatic time, because \u2014 well, Andre\nDumas, who was one of the head Cimade people in the camps, got to know the\ndirectors and the soldiers all much better than I did. And for one convoy he sat in\nwith the director and decided who would \u2014 I mean, not who would go, but whether\nthere was a discrep \u2014 whether families being separated. And he\u2019d argue with the\nman, no you can\u2019t send her, because her husband\u2019s here, or vice-a-versa. And he\ntried \u2014",
        "Q: Did that work?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Did that wor \u2014 succeed?",
        "A: It worked \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 1t worked in that he was able to keep several families\ntogether, but also it took such a toll on him, cause if he took out one person, another\nperson had to take their place. And Andre went oh \u2014 decided he just couldn\u2019t\nmorally do this any more.",
        "Q: It seems you \u2014 you reflect in your diary about the absurdity of the situation.\nSometimes a woman\u2019s husband is 60, so he\u2019s excluded from a \u2014 a transport. And\nthen she\u2019s 50 and \u2014 and she \u2014 she\u2019Il be on it, because she\u2019s too young to be\nJune 11, 2009\nexcluded. And if she was actually Romanian, but she was born on the\nCzechoslovakian border or something like that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you try to find ways of getting around these \u2014",
        "A: You try anything, but then you also run into the moral dilemma, di \u2014 what right\ndo you have to decide that this person should go on this [indecipherable]. The\nrefugees didn\u2019t know for sure where they were going, I suppose they had some idea.\nBut we\u2019d already by then learned about Auschwitz, so the dilemma was, can we\nreally decide that this person should not go, or should go? Now the director of the\ncamp had to make the choice, but that was his job.\nEnd of Tape One\nJune 11, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Going back to \u2014 to our discussion about the state you found people in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nRivesaltes, and the fact that when they\u2019re physically so weak and sick, that morally\nand intellectually, they have no \u2014 no desire \u2014",
        "A: They have \u2014 they no \u2014 not only no desire, but no goal. As long as they had a\ngoal, whether it was just to live another day or so, and they could see some hope in\nthe future, I think that would encourage them to try and do something. But when\nthey just kind of give up and see no future at all, then that\u2019s very depressing, not\nonly for themselves, but for everybody else. Because there\u2019s really nothing you can\ndo, you can\u2019t give them what they really need, is more food, because you don\u2019t have\nit.",
        "Q: At one point you talk about one of the meetings of the Committee de Nimes, and\nDr. Vay(ph) gave his report. Do you remember? He was mentioning about, he was\ntalking about the dire state of people in the camps, and in your diary you reflect on\nthat, and you \u2014 because he said that people were \u2014 they tried helping them by giving\nthem more food, or giving them shots, and they were too far gone. And that \u2014",
        "A: I think a s \u2014 I think a person reaches a point where they\u2019ve lost interest. Either\nthey\u2019ve lost a mate, or they\u2019ve just seen other people go re \u2014 go downhill, you might\nsay. And once that happens, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them back. And you can\u2019t do it\nJune 11, 2009\nwith just food, you have to give them some reason for living. And it\u2019s true they\nhave no reason for living, if they\u2019re gonna be sent off to Auschwitz. Why bother?",
        "Q: Did you question your beliefs, your religious faith, because of that? Did that\nmake you reflect on what you had been studying, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, it makes you \u2014 well, 1t certainly makes you reflect on what you\u2019re doing,\nwhether there\u2019s anything else you can do. You can\u2019t give up hope on them, because\nthen you\u2019ve also gotten in the same situation that they\u2019re in. So it\u2019s a matter of\nmaintaining your own spiritual feelings and beliefs, that there\u2019s gotta be a better\nplace, and a better time. But you \u2014 if you can\u2019t see any future, I mean, France was\nin a very sad situation, economically and e-every way. And I think I found that\nparticularly true right \u2014 right after the big debacle, the French couldn\u2019t realize what\nhappened to them. They knew they had the biggest army in \u2014 in Europe, and it just\ndisappeared, dissolved.",
        "Q: You also mentioned that you were worried about the capacity to adapt of people\nwho had been immigrating and moved around from place to place, and \u2014",
        "A: This was the difficulty, you would \u2014 everybody wanted to get out, and not\neverybody would put in a request for an exit visa, or for a visa from \u2014 and\neverybody had friends. Like there was one \u2014 one person who was dif \u2014 different \u2014 di\n\u2014 whose rel \u2014 relative worked in the church office in New York, Dr. Forell(ph).\nJune 11, 2009\nAnd of course, he took a personal interest in this relative, and wrote to us about his\nrelatives in the camp. I said, well, if you can get him a visa, that the best thing you\ncould do. Well, even with all his connections, he couldn\u2019t get a visa for her. So you\nhad to tell a person, well, not now, but keep on hoping, keep \u2014 so it was not\nsurprising that people would try and walk out of the camp and head for the frontier.",
        "Q: Do you remember if any of them were caught?",
        "A: Oh, some were caught, I mean the \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many hundreds had tried\nto get across. But \u2014 well, even, for instance, a person with an American passport,\nand a visa like Ronald Elliot, who was one of the leaders of the World Student\nChristian Federation, came to visit. This was before America was in the war, of\ncourse. And he had an exit permit, and wi \u2014 so he came down to visit Rivesaltes,\nwhich 1s fairly near to the border. And we\u2019d showed him around and spend the day\nor so with him showing him different parts of the camp and situation. Then he got\non the train to go to Cerbere(ph), which is border into Spain, and was turned down\nfor some reason, they didn\u2019t accept his exit visa. So he\u2019d come back and we spent\nanother day with him, put him on the train again, about three times before he finally\ngot across. And he had all the papers he needed, but s-some folks in there along the\nway decided well, why should I let him go? So \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: You mentioned that sometimes the guards gave you trouble, going from one part\nof the camp to the other because perhaps they didn\u2019t recognize you, or they had\norders, or other times they let you go right through.",
        "A: Well the camps were not run 1n very fashionable, very military way, and the\nthing that \u2014 oh, I think I mentioned that Madame Jurano(ph), who was a Swiss\nlady, a very good friend from Switzerland down visiting, and she got so mad when\nthe \u2014 she went into the camp and there was the guard smoking, and talking to her\nwith cigarette in his mouth. And being the good Swiss, she felt that was disgusting.\nBut that was typical of the camps, I mean, s-sol \u2014 soldiers were not \u2014 they were\ncivilian guards, or soldiers, they just had no discipline at all. So you could \u2014 in one\nway it was very easy to get in and out of the camp, another way you never knew\nwhen they were gonna crack down and make it more difficult.",
        "Q: At one point you \u2014 you mention even organizing activities for them because they\nseem to be bored.",
        "A: Oh, they were. I mean, who likes to stand at a gate for eight, 10 hours? It didn\u2019t\nwork out too well, cause they\u2019d come one time and then not show up for another\nmonth or so.",
        "Q: At one point you mentioned looking for the Madagascarians, or the people\nfrom Madagascar.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Madagascar.",
        "Q: And could you tell me a little about them?",
        "A: Well see, this was a mil \u2014 originally a military camp, and it was set up for troops\nin north Africa. The beginning of the war, they\u2019d come and stay there, then go up to\nthe fr \u2014 to the front lines. And evidently these were Madagascarans who were in \u2014\nrecruited to fight and then the war was over, so they didn\u2019t come. Eventually they\ncame to work in the \u2014 to work in the work camps. See, the Germans, or the French\nand Germans tried to put everybody \u2014 every male, into work camp, cause there were\nso many soldiers who were still prisoners in euro \u2014 in Germany, and they needed a\nlot of workers. In fact, some of our students were sent over to Brest, which was a\nbig submarine base for the Germans, and worked in the foundations there for a\nwhile, until some colonel, German colonel found out they were Jewish and sent\nthem back.",
        "Q: You mentioned in Marseilles somebody comes in and wants some workers from\nRivesaltes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did he want them to do?",
        "A: Probably labor.",
        "Q: He heard that you had cheap labor?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Labor, maybe a farm, maybe work. It\u2019s amazing when you take out a whole\narmy of young men, how qui \u2014 hard it is to get anything done.",
        "Q: You mentioned you remember when United States enters the war after Pearl\nHarbor, and you write in your diary on the ninth of December, 1941 that we\u2019ve\nentered the war. And that is the beginning of a period of uncertainty for you,\nbecause you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to continue your activities.",
        "A: Well, we knew that the Germans were in control at Vichy, although not openly,\nand I\u2019m sure they are not happy to see America come into the war, or the \u2014 or in th\n\u2014 in fact, for a while, as I recall, we, after Pearl Harbor, Japan declared war on us,\nand we declared war on Japan, but not on Germany for about a week or so. So \u2014",
        "Q: You mentioned that you went into Les Milles and somebody told you that they\nhad a \u2014a secret radio.",
        "A: Yeah. I suppose every camp had some secret radios like that. They try and hide\nand so they get news long before we would. But that \u2014",
        "Q: What was your feeling when you heard that United States had entered the war?",
        "A: I suppose like everybody else, kind of shocked. And then, course I started\nthinking whether we should really get out, or we could \u2014 Lowrie, I know at one\ntime, wanted to leave right away and go back to the States, he wanted to get\ninvolved in the war effort. And I guess he found out it wasn\u2019t that easy to get out as\nJune 11, 2009\nquickly. Eventually he went to Switzerland, along with, I think, most of the other\nAmericans who were working in one of the various organizations. But at the time\nwe didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019re gonna be taken, put into camps, as the Americans in\nGermany were, of course were. But there they had the protection of the consulate,\nwe had no protection at all. And we could have joined the people in the camps.",
        "Q: That was a serious consideration.",
        "A: It was, very definitely, whether we should try and leave while we still could.",
        "Q: And you decided to stay on?",
        "A: We decided to stay on, that we had a responsibility to work. And there was no, at\nthe time there was no outward expression from the Germans [indecipherable] still\nunoccupied. I think the thing that took it off was the French navy was down in \u2014 in\nthe Mediterranean.",
        "Q: Toulon?",
        "A: In Toulon. And the \u2014 eventually, the Germans wanted the navy and the \u2014 the\nFrench scuttled the ships, which was a big blow to the Germans. I think the German\nafter that were \u2014 were much more strict. And eventually they did just take over all\nof France.",
        "Q: And what happened at that point?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: At that point we were \u2014 had either gone to Switzerland or went \u2014 actually, I\nthink I talked to one of the young Cimade fellows who had helped smuggle people\ninto Switzerland. He showed me how to get across the barbed wire. Take your coat\noff, throw the coat over, then jump oh \u2014 jump over, but I didn\u2019t have to do that,\nfortunately.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little. There was a point where the French were inspecting the\ncamps. They had a man named Andre Jonfur(ph), who was from Vichy, and he\nwas doing a report on the camps. Do you remember ever being present when there\nwere Vichy officials visiting the camps?",
        "A: Oh, I must have been there at times, I don\u2019t recall any mention with them, or\nmeeting them.",
        "Q: There was also a point where the German general Danika(ph) started visiting the\ncamps. It was in July 1942. You \u2014 do you have \u2014 remember hearing about that?",
        "A: I remember hearing the Germans were coming to visit.",
        "Q: But you weren\u2019t present?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t present.",
        "Q: Was anyone you know present, like Dumas or Lowrie?",
        "A: Oh, I \u2014 Lowrie \u2014 Lowrie didn\u2019t go into the camps too much. He \u2014 that was the\nfunctionaries of the higher government. No, I don\u2019t remember. Those are the things\nJune 11, 2009\nhe kind of just took for granted. He knew the Germans could come in any time, and\nthere were Germans stationed in Marseilles, but the French wanted very little to do\nwith them.",
        "Q: Rivesaltes kept changing its disposition. Apparently they kept moving people\nfrom one ilo(ph) and barracks to another. And you mention that you had to change\nyour barracks and your foyer. How \u2014 do you know wh-why that happened?",
        "A: I think what \u2014 the reason they moved the internees from one ilo(ph) to the other,\nthey had certain ilos(ph) that they were getting ready to ship people out in, and they\nwanted to get them into a barracks all together.",
        "Q: Did you know that?",
        "A: Oh, I knew that was the reason for their shifting them.",
        "Q: But you shifted your foyer with them?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t shi \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think we shifted the foyer at all.",
        "Q: Did you see any changes in the camp, was more barbed wire, or more \u2014 or \u2014",
        "A: Not more barbed wire, but you could tell when a convoy was being organized,\nbecause everybody was more or less on their \u2014 on edge and nervous about who was\ngoing, who wasn\u2019t going.",
        "Q: How did that work? Were you \u2014 you were present when they were starting to\nprepare the convoys?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Well, we were present that we were doing our job in the camps, in trying to keep\nas normal a situation as possible.",
        "Q: You were still bringing in paper and paints and \u2014",
        "A: Penci \u2014 pencil \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and musical instruments.",
        "A: Right. We were trying to keep things going as simply as possible, but always\nbehind, you know, in the background there was always this uncertainty about who\nwas going to show up. And once they got into the ilo(ph) that was being evacuated\nor sent out, then they \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember which ilo(ph) it was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall which one.",
        "Q: Do you remember who put the list together, it was the comman \u2014",
        "A: The commandant \u2014 well, the Germans would ask for say, 150 Jews, and the\ncommandant would have to pick out 150 people to go.",
        "Q: Were there times when you actually went and said \u2014 you \u2014 you told me you\ndidn\u2019t want to be involved in the choice, but did you plead for somebody at one\npoint?",
        "A: I\u2014I didn\u2019t, cause I was in a little different situation. The French could do it,\nbecause they were talking to Frenchmen. But I didn\u2019t feel it was my job as an\nJune 11, 2009\nAmerican to get involved in it. And then the French eventually \u2014 and the Cimade\neventually, as I said before, Andre Dumas found out he just couldn\u2019t do it morally\nany more.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 you have a camera with you, and \u2014",
        "A: Had a what?",
        "Q: \u2014 You have a camera with you at \u2014 at some point.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because there are pictures that were with your collection in \u2014 in France, and\nthey were pictures of the \u2014 what we think are the deportation convoys. Do you\nremember how that was set up? You got up in the morning and all of a sudden\npeople \u2014",
        "A: Well, you knew something was coming up, because people getting very nervous\nand uncertain. So when they actually started assembling people, get ready for the\ntrucks, I think we all were in a very \u2014 very near there with an open window. We\ncouldn\u2019t go over to the ke \u2014 to the convoy, of course, because the \u2014 there were\nsoldiers \u2014 there were not a lot of soldiers around, there were soldiers around, but \u2014\nso that\u2019s when I took the pictures, from inside of the \u2014 a window, about a hundred\nyards away.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: What was your motivation in taking the pictures? As some sort of proof that this\nwas going on?",
        "A: I think just it was another event in the camp. Always a sad one, and discouraging\none, but \u2014",
        "Q: Did people \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I happened to have my camera.",
        "Q: How did \u2014 how did people prepare for it? Were they allowed to take something\nwith them?",
        "A: Oh they \u2014 they were told to pack a suitcase, th-they have to carry it.",
        "Q: Were there children?",
        "A: Not many children, no, mostly adults. But there were families. Although by then\nI think most of the small children had been taken out by the Swiss Red Cross, or\n[indecipherable] enfant.",
        "Q: How long did this go on, the preparation and the gathering of the people\ntogether?",
        "A: Oh, oh, the whole thing culminated in one day.",
        "Q: They \u2014",
        "A: Where they did bring the people out, and they were standing there, of course.\nTheir friends were standing around saying goodbye. And then the \u2014 the\nJune 11, 2009\n[indecipherable] all the trucks showed up, and they put them into the trucks to take\nthem to the railway station.",
        "Q: They were open trucks?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And they went \u2014",
        "A: Those were big, coal burning trucks that smelled terrible.",
        "Q: Did the people \u2014 were the people given anything to eat or drink while they were\nwaiting?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think they were fed \u2014",
        "Q: They waited all day without anything?",
        "A: Pll say it didn\u2019t take too long, once they got them assembled, and just brought\nthe trucks in and took them out.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: Nota very pleasant time, but th-th \u2014 you always wonder well \u2014 well, should we\nhave done something, but then what \u2014 what could you have done? You certainly\ncould not revolt, or start a revolution.",
        "Q: Were there people who \u2014 who were saying goodbye and didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, because th-these were their friends. Most of the people had come\ntogether from Germany, and had shipped down here and known each other in\nJune 11, 2009\nGermany for years, maybe. And then for some reason one group was sent off \u2014\nsent back to Germany, and others was kept in the camp. And eventually the camp\nwas \u2014 I assume was completely liquidated.",
        "Q: You\u2019re just talking about Rivesaltes?",
        "A: Yes, but that was after \u2014 after I\u2019d left, and after America was in the war. Now,\nthe Spaniards were still there, had been there for oh, probably four or five years.\nCould I take a quick break and stretch my \u2014 my leg going to sleep. [break] You\nwant to talk more about deportation?",
        "Q: Do you remember we were talking about how people were saying goodbye and\nthey were \u2014 were there \u2014 was there ever a moment where somebody was on the\ntruck, or ready to get on the truck and then they didn\u2019t go?",
        "A: Yeah, there were times like that, when people \u2014",
        "Q: Can you describe that?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s always dramatic, because normally they tried to run things very\nsmoothly, just put people on the truck and drive away. And then if at the last minute\nthere\u2019s a change in people, like if somebody intervened, or if somebody else had\ncalled Vichy with a name of a person they wanted to take off, or \u2014 and Vichy would\nrespond to the camp, they\u2019d have to take them off the truck.",
        "Q: And what could be some of the reasons that the person would be taken off?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Oh, who knows? Hard to say. They had enough influence to \u2014 to get through to a\nminister in Vichy. It would take quite \u2014 quite a deal of influence, but then many of\nthese \u2014 many of the Germans had been functionaires, had been important people in\nBerlin or in Germany, and may have known the French deputies, or some \u2014 I\nmean, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was, but it could be any one \u2014 any reason.",
        "Q: And when the person actually had to get off the truck?",
        "A: Truck. Then there\u2019d be somebody else who\u2019d be put in their place, which was\nreal dramatic cause they\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d say they cut [indecipherable] 150 people and\nstop there, the next 10 people in line would be sent back to the barracks, or be kept\nthere until the trucks left, if they didn\u2019t have to change. So it\u2019s \u2014 it was dra \u2014 always\ndramatic and tragic time, cause you hate to see anybody \u2014 anybody be taken away.",
        "Q: Did you know exactly where they were going? You knew they would go to the\nRivesaltes train station, but did you know where they were headed after that?",
        "A: Up to Paris, I think it\u2019s in Drancy where the camp was, and they\u2019d probably\nspend some time there, and then they go back to \u2014 then they\u2019d go to Germany.\nWhere they \u2014 which camp they went to, Buchenwald or Auschwitz, wherever they\n\u2014 or in some cases they were \u2014 if they were young enough, they go back to\nGermany and they put them under work camps. Because Germany needed a \u2014\nJune 11, 2009\nneeded a lot of workers too with the whole army out of the country. So you couldn\u2019t\n\u2014 you couldn\u2019t say for sure or not.",
        "Q: At the end of the day, what was the atmosphere around the camp?",
        "A: Very somber. Very quiet. Nobody really felt like doing anything, because you\u2019d\nbeen pretty well drained just watching them leave. So what \u2014",
        "Q: Was your religion any consolation?",
        "A: They what?",
        "Q: Was the Bible or religion any consolation?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I suppo \u2014 I think there may have been a service of some kind,\nbut not necessarily. No, it was more or less just a complete let down when you work\nwith people for a number of months, and then some of them disappeared. I guess\nfortunately, we didn\u2019t know for sure where they were going.",
        "Q: How \u2014 did you \u2014 you were present at several of these events, of these\ndeportations?",
        "A: I think only a couple.",
        "Q: Were you ever present in other camps when people were being sent on to this\ntype of action?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: No, I\u2014 they more or less transfer one camp to the other, and the camps are all\ndifferent. Gurs and Rivesaltes were probably the two big camps for German \u2014\nGerman refugees. Vernet was more of a political \u2014 political prisoners.",
        "Q: You also went to No\u00e9 and Recebedou?",
        "A: Recebedou yes, I do remember those two well.",
        "Q: And Les Milles?",
        "A: Les Milles was right next to Marseilles and \u2014 and that was a more hopeful\ncamp, cause that\u2019s where they were \u2014 those who had their first papers in order and\nhad to get more papers would ca \u2014 go to Les Milles cause then they go into\nMarseilles, see the consulates and work on getting their final papers together, so\nthat was a\u2014 much more of a transient camp, even though very active with artists\nand \u2014 and a library.",
        "Q: When you knew that the \u2014 you \u2014 you were present at two of these convoys, did\nyou find out when others were going to occur?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall, I don\u2019t think so, no way. I don\u2019t think anybody knew because the\ngerm \u2014 Germans would make the decision, we need 150 or 200 or 300.",
        "Q: But every time you went back, you weren\u2019t sure the people you knew would still\nbe there.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, you\u2019re never sure.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you run into the workers from OSE who were saving children?\nAndre Salamon(ph) or Liese(ph) Hannow(ph)?",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I knew the workers, I don\u2019t recall them at all particular. I knew they\nhad a good \u2014",
        "Q: You did see them?",
        "A: I did see them, and knew they had a good organization going. And they were \u2014 I\nthink they were mainly interested in trying to get these wer \u2014 young people into\nsome kind of a job work, or training for jobs.",
        "Q: And also the children.",
        "A: Children, yeah.",
        "Q: Maybe we\u2019ll take a break here.",
        "A: You want to \u2014",
        "Q: Is that okay? [break] I want to go back to Rivesaltes again.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: And I want to talk a little bit about your contact with other groups, not just the\nstudents from Germany. Do you remember meeting the Spanish?",
        "A: Very much so, cause the Spaniards had been there for about three years, three or\nfour years, since the end of the Spanish revolution, and they\u2019d pretty much settled in\nand made their own position there in the camp.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: Did they have more freedom than the others?",
        "A: I'd say they did because they\u2019d been there longer, and they knew the way\naround. And th-they had no place to go either, they were \u2014 they weren\u2019t too\nwelcome in France, but there \u2014 on the other hand, they took care of them, the\nFrench.",
        "Q: Did they have the same rations as the rest of the people in the camp?",
        "A: They must have had more, because they did their own cooking. I think I\nmentioned once that they invited me over to dinner, and they cooked Spanish rice\non an open fire out in the middle of the camp. And served a very good dinner,\nwhich I appreciated. Food was pretty much a central thought in everybody\u2019s mind\nall the time. But \u2014 so when you had a good meal, then the \u2014 made a lot of\ndifference.",
        "Q: Did you speak Spanish?",
        "A: No, I just como estsa, that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: You communicated in French?",
        "A: French, yeah. They\u2019d learned enough French by then to get by. But they \u2014 they\nweren\u2019t really internees so much as just residents in the camp, because I say,\nthey had no place \u2014 they couldn\u2019t go back to Spain.",
        "Q: Did they make \u2014 were they part of the work brigades?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: They were part of the leftist government.",
        "Q: But in \u2014 in Rivesaltes \u2014",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: \u2014 were they sent out to work?",
        "A: No, as I recall, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Did they come to your foyer to partake in artistic activities?",
        "A: They did, but not as thoroughly as we would have liked. They \u2014 they had pretty\nmuch their own life, and they pretty \u2014 and they were pretty well, so well established\nthat they had a family life.",
        "Q: Did they need \u2014",
        "A: Having lots of children, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did they need instruments, or \u2014",
        "A: Some, yes, not \u2014 one or two of each. You\u2019d find a violinist or a guitar player\namong the Spaniards. But I say, th-they already \u2014 they\u2019d been there so long that\nthey were \u2014 pretty much had a routine to their own life going.",
        "Q: Did they par \u2014 did they participate in some of the shows that were put on?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they would come to those.",
        "Q: And did they \u2014 did they perform in them?",
        "A: Once in a while, not \u2014 not a great deal, they \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: What kind of things did they do?",
        "A: Well, as I recall, the Spanish dances. They had more energy than the Germans,\nbecause they had, I suppose, better food that they prepared themselves. But, course\nthey wanted \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to get too settled in France, because they wanted to\ngo back to Spain eventually after Franco left. But tha \u2014 they didn\u2019t see any future,\nbecause they c \u2014 they knew they couldn\u2019t go back to France \u2014 to Spain without\nbeing put in prison or shot.",
        "Q: Were you in contact with any of the other populations? There were Roma in the\ncamps.",
        "A: Not too much, they had their own life pretty much, so \u2014 and again, they were \u2014\ndi-didn\u2019t have to stay, they could move out if they wanted. But again, they\u2019d have to\nearn \u2014 earn the living someplace, and like in most countries, they were never fully\nintegrated into the population. They had their own \u2014 own [indecipherable] and own\n\u2014 own life pretty much settled. It was a really mixture of people from all over,\nactually, Mediterranean area.",
        "Q: Did you know \u2014 it seemed in your \u2014 the diary that you mention more the people\nyou knew in Rivesaltes, it seems like you spent more time there, or that you were\nable to \u2014 to create more activities in Rivesaltes.",
        "A: Than anyplace else?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: Gurs \u2014",
        "A: No \u2014 Gurs \u2014 Gurs was very active, except Gurs \u2014 my ma \u2014 main memory of\nGurs was the mud. It rained a lot up there, and once it rained there was no drainage\nin the camp, so you were wading in through mud. But that \u2014 that\u2019s what deterred\neverything happening in Gurs.",
        "Q: When you brought things into the camps, whether it be paper or paints, or\ninstruments or books, did you have to use ration tickets, was there \u2014 how \u2014 how did\nyou go about buying thi \u2014 this \u2014",
        "A: Oh, you could buy paper, pencils, pens.",
        "Q: And books?",
        "A: Books, if you could find books, or they were donated books. Instruments, I\u2019m\nnot sure where they came from, but we were glad to have them.",
        "Q: But you had a budget for that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was from Geneva, or from Marseilles?",
        "A: Oh, no, well, the budget was for Marseilles, for France, but the money all came\neventually from Geneva.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: When you had to go about interviewing students to eventually you wanted to\ntake to Chambon, how did \u2014 how did that process go about? Did you set up shop in\n\u2014 in one of the barracks and say come in and talk to me?",
        "A: No, there are people you knew, having been there, and then the local French\ncommittees also would recommend students. Once in awhile there\u2019d be a French\nstudent that needed help, or needed to get out, get away. So the local committee\nwould do \u2014 run across students who needed help. Cause see, we were there to work\nwith all students, not just internees or refugees.",
        "Q: People who were living outside the camps.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And needed ma \u2014 they needed material help.",
        "A: And they needed a boost up at this time, because jobs weren\u2019t too plentiful in\nFrance.",
        "Q: Was there an age limit for \u2014 for bringing students to Le Chambon?",
        "A: Probably more a lower age limit. We needed \u2014 we weren\u2019t looking for high\nschool students, but there weren\u2019t too many of them anyway.",
        "Q: You \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: [indecipherable] the top age limit, I don\u2019t think there was any stated limit but by\nthe fact that there weren\u2019t too many older \u2014 older students, say over 40. There were,\nI think a couple older men, by that they\u2019re in their 40s.",
        "Q: So when you finally got a list together of say five boys that you would like to\ntake to La Maison des Roches, how did you go about \u2014 concretely, what was the \u2014\nwhat were the steps?",
        "A: Well, first you had to get the release from the camp, which means you had to\nprove that there was a place for them to go, and that they would be \u2014 not become a\ncharge to the state.",
        "Q: And who could give you that release? The commandant du camp?",
        "A: Commander du camp. And then you had to get permission from the \u2014 for travel,\nof course, and then permission to settle in Chambon at the prefecture there.",
        "Q: So you needed to go to the prefecture in Perpignan for the travel and the \u2014 and\nPre-Onvelet(ph) for the Ch-Chambon \u2014",

Was a matter of\ngetting not the camp, but getting La Roche opened. Main thing was getting heating\n\u2014 heat for it, cause Chambon was cold weather and they were coming out of the\nwarm Mediterranean weather.

But our main work was with prisoners of war, to identify\nstudents in the prisoner of war camps, particularly in Germany, cause we were in\nSwitzerland. But we were doing the same in Canada with German prisoners, and \u2014\nalthough I had nothing to do with the work in se \u2014 America. But we were sending\nbooks and identifying, putting them in touch with their colleges, when we found out\nwhere they \u2014 where they had gone to college, and whether \u2014 I was glad to run across\none who went to Yale or Oberlin.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: So from \u2014",
        "A: So that \u2014 so that \u2014 and I did that pretty much. Then I had another activity, you\nsee, there were a lot of American aviators who were interned in Switzerland, cause\ntheir plane was shot up and they couldn\u2019t get back to England, so they pulled into\nZurich, and of course, the Swiss interned them. But interned them up \u2014 then the\nSwiss tourism office was very dull in Switzerland there. Two Germans come in,\nbut nobody else, so the hotels were empty, so the Swiss put them up in a nice big\nhotel up in \u2014 oh, what\u2019s it called? Up in the mountains. So the aviators, once they\ngot over the shock of being shot down settled into kind of a touristy \u2014 touristy life.\nThey could ski, and they had \u2014 they were getting paid still by the embassy, or\ngetting it by the arm \u2014 air force.",

        "Q: At \u2014 at any point did you think about en-enlisting to fight in the American armed\nservices?",
        "A: I did in \u201944.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: After \u2014 and I did enlist and went \u2014 actually th-the American aviators couldn\u2019t get\nout of Switzerland until American troops had arrived on Swiss border. And then\nthey stayed [indecipherable] wanted to get rid of them, we get a \u2014 and they wanted\nto get back to England. So they brought in two \u2014 several planes, must have been\ntwo or 300.

They\narrived there and they found out I could speak German, so they put me on the staff \u2014\nor not staff, I mean, transferred me to their \u2014 they wanted somebody around to\nspeak German. But then \u2014",
        "Q: What did your duties consist of?",
        "A: Just being a soldier. Not much of anything, we \u2014",
        "Q: But, interacting with local population \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014 oh, we had \u2014 we had \u2014 no, as a re-deployment camp, the soldiers would\ncome in from all over Germany, being shipped home. And way \u2014 they spend\nmaybe five or six days there before they were sent home, off to Bremen, or take a\nship back. And then my transfer to Berlin, to military government and the\neducation department in the German youth \u2014 the German youth activities section.\nSo became head of the \u2014 see, Berlin, of course, was divided into four parts, and I\nJune 11, 2009\nbecame the head of the youth activities section for American zone \u2014 American \u2014\nAmerican section of Berlin.",
        "Q: But you were still in the army\u201d?",
        "A: Yes. Not ru \u2014 well, I was for a while, then I went back and demobilized and flew\nback in as a civilian, which was quite a switch. I remember I came back on a troop\nship.",
        "Q: You went back to the United States to demobilize?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: After the armistice?",
        "A: After, oh yeah, so it was \u2014 must have been \u201945, end of \u201945. Cause I remember I\ncame \u2014 there was a freeze on hiring, so I had \u2014 couldn\u2019t get [indecipherable] right\nback. And eventually I had to come to Washington, and wait for transportation\nthrough the Azores. And I remember going out to the airport in my civilian clothes,\nand all these colonels and captains are on the same flight, and they all stood around\nand waited for me to go on. Here I was, I\u2019d been a buck sergeant, and I couldn\u2019t\nfigure out what this, after you sir. They didn\u2019t know what my civilian rank was, so\nthat was an interesting time.",

        "A: Well, I'd been out of the States for 10 years, I figured time I got back, and I was\ninterested in getting into education, so I came back to Stanford for a year and got\nmy teaching credential.",
        "Q: What made you want to go into teaching? You were \u2014 it seemed that you might\nhave been destined to be a minister or a pastor in \u2014 when you went to divinity\nschool.",
        "A: Oh, I was \u2014 I think I wanted something a little broader than just a minister, and a\n\u2014 and working in the educational branch in Germany, where \u2014 re-educating the\nGerman youth, I figure that education was the field I wanted to work in. So I came\nback and my wife and small baby and a German Shepherd dog \u2014",
        "Q: So you had \u2014 your family was your wife, your \u2014 your baby and the German\nShepherd at that point?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: In 1949. Wha-What made you choose California and Stanford?",
        "A: My wife was from California, and I had an uncle who was a superintendent of\nschools in Palo Alto or Menlo Park. And they had a house we could use for a year\nJune 11, 2009\nor so, while I was go \u2014 while I was going to Stanford, that\u2019s why \u2014 one reason I\npicked Stanford. It\u2019s a good school.",
        "Q: A very good school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you feel a lot of change when you got back to the United States? You\u2019d\nbeen living in Europe for 10 years.",
        "A: Pretty much so. Not as much as I thought, cause I\u2019d been in touch with\nAmericans all along, and I\u2019d been in the army long enough to realize that what I\nmiss were all the little things that you forget about.",
        "Q: For example?",
        "A: Oh, about TVs. We didn\u2019t have a TV for a couple of years, so \u2014 for a number of\nyears. And of course, driving was no problem, but \u2014",
        "Q: Why was it more of a problem, there was more traffic in the United States?",
        "A: There was more traffic than \u2014 than in Europe, although I did have a car in\nEurope, but particularly around the big cities, traffic was heavy. Freeways were\nsomething new, although I\u2019d been on the autobahns in Germany which were\nenough of a problem.",
        "Q: So you finished your master\u2019s degree in education?",
        "A: Right.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: And what was your next step?",
        "A: Looking for a job, and I finally found one in [indecipherable] Coalinga in\nCalifornia, which is in the Fresno \u2014 central part of California, teaching world\nhistory to a bunch of kids who were growing up on farms in that area and were not\ninterested in world history, particularly, although a bunch of good students.",
        "Q: And did you teach any other subjects?",
        "A: French, a-and social studies.",
        "Q: Did you stay in the same school system for your \u2014",
        "A: For three years, then went to Beirut, Lebanon, where I spent five years there at\nthe international college. And then after five years in the Middle East, I came back\nto southern California, to Garden Grove in \u2014 which is in Orange County, right\nnext to Disneyland, and stayed there 25 years. Became principal of a high school.\nCalifornia was growing so fast in those days that first time I went there, there was\none high school in Garden Grove, within 10 years there were seven high schools,\nwith all the feeding schools. So I was principal for 10 years in southern California.",
        "Q: Did you remain in contact with any of the people with whom you were friendly\nduring the war? Andre Dumas, or Lowrie?",
        "A: Andre Dumas, | stayed in, Lowrie I s \u2014 I stayed in touch, mainly through\nChristmas letters. But I lost track of some of them.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "Q: Is the time that you were working with the European Student Relief Fund, and\nyour activities in the camps, did that give you some sort of \u2014 some sort of skills,\nnegotiating skills, or skills to \u2014 to \u2014 to learn to get things done?",
        "A: I think it gave me a greater appreciation of people, understanding of people. I\u2019m\nnot sure it gave me any special skills, except I think I found that Americans are not\nvery much interested in Europe. Right after the war, they\u2019d had enough of the war,\nand \u2014 and [indecipherable] so, in matter of teaching, you tried to bring in the things\nthat had happened and their influence on their lives, but most people were much\nmore interested in getting jobs and buying cars and living.",
        "Q: At one point in your diary you are at a meeting of the Committee de Nimes, and\nyou \u2019ve heard one of the dire reports that Dr. Vay(ph) gave about malnutrition and \u2014\nand you ha \u2014 you reflect upon what \u2014 that you thought man was intrinsically good,\nbut maybe the cruelty and the absurdity that you saw around you shook you. And\nyou seemed to talk about perhaps we are in the grips of demonic forces. Seems that\nyou were \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I went so f\u2014 well, maybe I have [indecipherable] demonic\nforces, but a \u2014 I certainly realized that the world was not a peaceful place, and that\nin some ways there was very little you could do to make any changes. You could\nchange individuals, and that\u2019s why I concentrated on individuals and working with\nJune 11, 2009\nthem, whereas major changes were something that it was really very difficult. You\nrealize there\u2019s gonna be crises around the world. [indecipherable] I was talking to a\ngroup of \u2014 actually at a Holocaust museum in Philadelphia and \u2014 where Hans\nSolomon(ph) was \u2014 lives. And one of the questions after this [indecipherable]\ngroup of students who said, well, can the Holocaust ever happen again? The only\nthing I can say wi \u2014 look, there\u2019s enough \u2014 enough \u2014 enough problems already, wa \u2014\nlike dur \u2014 like all in the middle \u2014 in the Middle East and Serbia, crises like that, in\nnorth Africa. And I\u2019m not sure we settled all those yet. I ju-just hope that it never\ncan happen again on such a schedu \u2014 scale.",
        "Q: When you mentioned being able to perhaps not change everything, but work\nwith individuals, there\u2019s a sense of \u2014 of hope and satisfaction when you finally get\nsome of those students out of Rivesaltes to the Chambon. And that was an\nexample maybe of as an individual.",
        "A: Well, that was \u2014 that was a big step, cause we worked so long and hard we \u2014 for\nit, and then failed the first time to get the nod and then went back a second time. But\nI think when you see people actually in the situation where they\u2019re changing their\nlives, which it was, cause they could just as well have been on a convoy. Except\nthey were all young, they would probably not go on to a camp, they\u2019d go on toa\nwork camp someplace. But there\u2019s some satisfaction to know that you helped a few\nJune 11, 2009\npeople like that. It was a much more critical situation than today, and change came\nabout so quickly, too.",
        "Q: It gave you the courage to keep going on.",
        "A: They what?",
        "Q: If you \u2014 it gave you the courage \u2014 it seemed to give you the courage to keep\ntrying.",
        "A: Yeah, it gi \u2014 gives you \u2014 you have to have some results, and some \u2014 I don\u2019t want\nto say victories, but some positive results, otherwise it becomes a pretty dreary\nworld.",
        "Q: You remained in contact with Hans Solomon(ph), or did you find that you\nconnect with him again in Chambon-sur-Lignon in 2004?",
        "A: I saw him then and then I saw him earlier this year in Philadelphia. So it was\nkind of pleasant to get back there and talk with him.",
        "Q: Is there something that you would like to add about your experiences in \u2014 during\nthe war and what you accomplished, what you didn\u2019t accomplish?",
        "A: I think as I reflect back on it, I realize the very extraordinary times. That I was\nvery fortunate to be able to be in a situation where I could do some \u2014 some good,\nnot very much. But it gave me an appreciation of difficulties people have and that\nyou can do something, even though very small, just by giving a person a book, or\nJune 11, 2009\ncrayons, or artists. At least give them temporary relief from their situation. That\nwe\u2019re not gonna solve all the problems right away.",
        "Q: When you started writing your diary and it seemed mostly destined to \u2014 for your\nparents, sometimes you even write to your mother and dad. Were you conscious\nthat you were living in extraordinary times and that you had to get it down, because\nyou were actually in the midst of something exceptional?",
        "A: Well, I felt \u2014 first, my letters to my parents, we\u2019ve always corresponded. And I\nfelt if I could at least open up with somebody, and give them some sense of my\nfeelings and my beliefs, that would help \u2014 help to go on to continue with the work.\nAnd the diary I just felt [indecipherable] this is a special time, and \u2014",
        "Q: You mentioned that sometimes you felt lonely, and that you would like to come\nback and have somebody to talk to at night.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you realized that to accomplish something you needed to be part of a group.\nYou mentioned the feelings of camaraderie you had at Yale.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I think everybody\u2019s looking for somebody to express \u2014 to be able to sit\ndown and talk with, or just relate to, especially when you\u2019re 25 or 26.",
        "Q: You mentioned \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: And th-the Cimade was a very good group from that point of view, and a \u2014 they\nwould meet with them regularly.",
        "Q: You mentioned coming in to one of the camps, for example Gurs, and talking\nwith a student who \u2014 his name was Max, and he was so appreciative of the fact that\nyou took time to talk to him. He was working in the kitchen. So you were aware of\nthat, you wrote it down, that every human being needs to be recognized.",
        "A: Yeah, I think you begin to realize that people want to share, and always need\nsomebody they can open up to, and can talk to, and felt that through education there\nwas a possibility of helping people realize what they want to do. It becomes a very\npersonal thing after a while, looking for a warm contact with people.",
        "Q: You must have established it with your students, if you stayed on and \u2014 for 25\nyears in one school, and \u2014 and probably there was an exchange there.",
        "A: Yeah, I still have friends among the students that I knew. But also realize that a\nlot of the work in education is very temporary, and that you don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, every\nday is not a major day. A lot of days are very routine and that you have to get used\nto it. You try and break out of the routine and make a difference in people\u2019s lives.",
        "Q: Would you like to add anything?",
        "A: I appreciate the chance to be here and to talk with you about this, cause I felt ri \u2014\nwas looking over my diary, I realize that \u2014 what extraordinary times they were. And\nJune 11, 2009\nyou mentioned you might even think of publishing it, well I \u2014 I have trouble getting\nthoughts down now. I mean, as I say, my children want me to write memoirs, which\ntakes me time to get going on it; my computer skills are not too great. So, glad to be\nable to share this with you, and \u2014",

        "Answer: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m tra \u2014 Tracy Strong, born in Seattle, Washington, September 4\",\n1915, and grew up there. My father had moved to Seattle in 1910 to join the Seattle\nYMCA as a Boys\u2019 Worker. So we spent the first 12 years at \u2014 in Seattle on Queen\nAnne Hill. Eventually moved up on the boulevard in Queen Anne Hill and built a\nhouse looking out over Lake Union. My bra \u2014 I have a older brother Robbins, and a\nyounger sister Ruth, and we enjoyed a very pleasant gro \u2014 time at growing up in\nSeattle; it wasn\u2019t quite as crowded as it is now. The house we built is \u2014 in fact, I\njust heard from the lady who lives there, she bought it from my father in 1923, and\nhas lived in it ever since. So the house remained the same. We had a normal\nchildhood, my father was always off toa YMCA camp. And summers we\u2019d join\nhim in the camp, so we spent a very pleasant time in Seattle. Then in 1923 my\nJune 11, 2009\nfather was appointed to the Boys\u2019 Work secretary for the world\u2019s YMCA in\nGeneva, Switzerland, so the family all packed up. I was five, my sister was seven\nor eight, and my brother was 10 or 11. And my father indicated that if we\u2019re going\nto work in a world\u2019s organization, he should see something of the Orient. So we\nsailed out of Seattle in November 1923 on the \u2014 one of the princess ships, and went,\nactually, practically all the way around the world in six months. As I think back on\nthat, must \u2014 and have traveled with my own children, here were three young\nchildren and my mother taking care of us all the way around the world. We went\nfirst to Japan, and got there just after the big earthquake in Japan in 1923. Then\nM-Moncton(ph), Manchuria, China, Hong Kong. Then around through India, up\nthrough the Suez Canal, went over to Palestine, and eventually to Venice, an-and\narrived in Geneva in April 1924. Which was quite a trip. So we settled into\nGeneva, which was then a much smaller town that it is now, but also a very\ninternational town, because a lot of international organizations were there, including\nthe international Red Cross, and then many of the other youth-serving or people-\nserving organizations.",
        "A: Oh, we started out in the public school, across the street [indecipherable] where\nwe had to learn French 1n a hurry if we wanted to play. We children picked up\nJune 11, 2009\nFrench very quickly, my folks never did, so we asked them not to speak French\nwhen we were, cause their accent was so poor. Anyway, they went there, went to\ninternational school for a year or so, and eventually came back to this country for\ntwo ye \u2014 my father thought I should learn English, so I came back for two years to a\nhigh school in Bainbridge Islands, Washington, and finished high school there.\nThen I was 16, at which time I felt I was a little too young for college, and as he and\nmy mother were traveling a great deal for the y \u2014 world\u2019s YMCA, I went to school\nin Germany, Deutsche Jugend \u2014 Jugendhof, which was 1932. And if you\nremember your history well, that was the time that Hitler came to power, in 1933.\nSo I went through that whole time of the change in regime and cha \u2014 and heard\nHitler speak twice, big rallies. And then at the end of the year, went back to Ohio \u2014\nOberlin College, Ohio, where I spent four years and got my bachelor\u2019s degree,\n1937. At that time I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I wanted to do, a chance of working in\nthe YMCA, or in the church. So I went to Yale Divinity School for three years in\nNew Haven, Connecticut. In 19 grad \u2014 got my da\u2014 my master\u2019s degree in divinity\nand it was in 1940, first war had already started in Europe, and my father had\nheaded up the war \u2014 war prisoner\u2019s aid of the YMCA, which was approved in the\nGeneva Convention, that international Red Cross took care of the physical\nproblems of the prisoners on ev-every country, and the YMCA took care of their\nJune 11, 2009\nspiritual and intellectual problems, physical problems. So, my father was the head\nof this organization, but he \u2014 with headquarters in Geneva, although \u2014 and Geneva\nwas still open then. 1940, of course, the \u2014 France fell. In just a few weeks,\nblitzkrieg [indecipherable] Germans. I did \u2014",
        "A: I went back to \u2014 actually to ge \u2014 headed for Geneva. Had to take a boat from\nNew York to Lisbon, then across Spain where we got \u2014 just at the time France had\nfallen, so everything was closed down, so we were stuck in Barcelona for several\nweeks. And then eventually the group went across southern France and up the\nRhone Valley to Geneva. And went originally to work with the European Student\nRelief fund, which was an organization made up of the three student serving\norganizations. The World Student Christian Federation, the Protestants. The Pax\nRomana, the Catholics, NISS, a neutral organization. And our job was to do for stu\n\u2014 university students what the YMCA was doing for the general population. So we\nsingled out students in camps in every country. I did go to Germany for about six\nmonths, to work in the prisoner of war camp, and visited Stalag 16, I think it was,\nand 17, one section of Germany. The ma \u2014 most of the prisoners were either\nFrench or British, Polish. A few ru \u2014 quite a few Russians eventually, which now\nJune 11, 2009\nbecause Russia did not sign the Geneva Convention, we could not get into the\ncamps to visit them.",
        "A: Mainly with the YMCA and the \u2014 and the European Student Relief Fund, the\nESRF, it\u2019s called, for them I was ju \u2014 identify students, and try and get books,\nmaterial to them, so they continue their studies. See, in the camps, particularly the\nofficers\u2019 camps, the officers were not allowed to work. They had nothing to do\nexcept organize activities. So the YMCA brought in books, sporting material,\nviolins, anything to keep them occupied during their imprisonment. So I\u2019d go the \u2014\nthere were about, I suppose, 15 camps that I visited off and on in the fall of 1941.\nEventually \u2014 course, America wasn\u2019t in the war yet, but in 1941 I went back to\nGeneva. The Germans would not let me go in the camps any more, they thought I\nhad helped a prisoner escape, which was the last thing in the world I would have\ndone. So the Germans went and closed the camps to me. So \u2014",
        "A: So I went back to Geneva. [interruption] So I went in the \u2014 must have been\nabout March I left Germany, went to Geneva, where headquarters were for the\nASRF, and \u2014 and by this time there were camps set up in southern France. See,\nwhen the Germans took France, everybody in northern France went to the south,\nJune 11, 2009\nto get away the rapid advance. The Germans kind of overran everybody, but then,\nas you recall, it divided France into occupied and unoccupied France, with the\noccupied being headquarters in Marseilles and Vichy. The Vichy government was\nset up in \u2014 in Vichy under General P\u00e9tain, Laval, which put the Germans very\nmuch in control. But at least they didn\u2019t \u2014 were not interfering in southern \u2014 in oro \u2014\nunoccupied France.",
        "A: No, Donald Lowrie was the head of the YMCA organization in southern\nFrance.",
        "A: He was based in Marseilles [indecipherable] and \u2014 and the \u2014 our \u2014 our student\norganization worked with the YMCA, or under the YMCA because they had access\nto the camps.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t so much his asking, he \u2014 he was in France, and we were \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 my or \u2014 organization, the European Student Relief Fund wanted somebody to\ncoordinate things for students only, in southern France, so I \u2014 and the entry was\nthrough the YMCA. So I went, being sent by the European Student Relief Fund, be\nworking with the YMCA.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Yes, he was one of the secretaries.",
        "A: Yes, there is. A-Andr\u00e9 de Bionay was the head of the organization, was hired\nby the three religious groups, or student groups that had formed the organization. So\nI was responsible to him, but my activities were pretty much up to me, what I could\ndo with \u2014 to help students in southern France.",
        "A: The European Student Relief Fund.",
        "A: I did. That was part of my job, to travel from camp to camp and help set up the\n[indecipherable] or the biblioth\u00e9ques, in the various camps.",
        "A: Spiritual, phy \u2014 whatever physical support we could give. You know, I\u2019m sure\nmainly, my main job was to identify students and see what we could do to either get\nthem out of the camps, or to get them material to study with. Wasn\u2019t too happy with\nstudents staying in the camps, cause conditions were hardly conducive towards\nJune 11, 2009\nintellectual study. And there were all students that either started on a career in their\nhome country, whether it was Poland or Germany, Romania, Lithuania.",
        "A: Oh, very much so, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, the one I remember the best wa-was Hans Solomon, who \u2014 we stayed\nfriends, so I still correspond with him. Edgar Druenhoot(ph), Hans Mayer(ph).",
        "A: Palos(ph), and \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any of their names, but I still have one or two paintings that\nthey did.",
        "A: We purchased them in a way that \u2014 or they were donated. So \u2014 and we set up\nexhibitions for them so they could be sold.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Yes, well, we were able to provide violins, cellos, guitars. Usually had a piano in\nthe camp. So they would set up small musical groups, depending on the activities,\nand depending on the interest, depending on the health, because the condition in the\ncamps weren\u2019t really conducive to any intellectual work.",
        "A: I remember very vaguely that a group of Russians \u2014 they were mainly though\nRussians who\u2019d left Russia during the revolution. So they were what you call the\nwhite Russians, who had settled in Paris, with a large colony of them in Paris, and\nwith the rest of the French they left the north and came south. So my work was\nprimarily centered in Marseilles, I lived at the Hotel Terminus, and then we\u2019d\ntravel regularly to different camps.",
        "A: Very interesting, very active, one of these what do you call it? A-type persons.\nVery outgoing, charming wife, who did all the driving for Donald. And Donald had\nworked in Czechoslovakia with the Czechs, the Czech YMCA, and\nJune 11, 2009\n[indecipherable] Czech, and so had a very special place in his heart for the Czechs.\nAny Czech student came by, always got some help. But Don was also the head of\nwhat they called the Nimes committee, which was a committee of all the various\nprivate organizations: the Red Cross; Unitarian; Quakers; OSE, Jewish\norganization. And they met once a month in Nimes, so it became known as the\nNimes committee, to coordinate their efforts, and then to intervene. And Don would\ngo to Vichy to talk to the representatives of the government in Vichy about\npermission to do certain things.",
        "A: Well, one thing that happened was be able to get the refugees out of the camps,\nif they could support themselves, so that Vichy government did finally approve that.\nWhereas if an organization would provide for them so the state didn\u2019t pay anything,\nthey could get them out of the camps, or a prisoner of private means could get out\nof the camps.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t go to Vichy, I went to Nimes regularly, to the Nimes committee.",
        "A: Yes, I was representing the student relief fund and \u2014 but the c-committee wa \u2014 it\nwas a very [indecipherable] very worthwhile, very interesting committee, because\nJune 11, 2009\npeople of various interests \u2014 the Red Cross, of course, was mainly interested in\nproviding food, and the Swiss Red Cross particularly, took care of a lot of children,\nwhereas some of the other organizations were providing just intellectual or spiritual\nhelp.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t say that I do remember them. I met them all, of course, and knew\nthem, but that\u2019s a long time ago.",
        "A: Not really in any detail.",
        "A: A Swiss doctor, I think. I just by chance met him because I travel a good deal,\nand meet a lot of people.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Oh, it always was animated, because everybody there was an intellectual when \u2014\nvery di-different interests, but they all [indecipherable] in their own interests, and \u2014\nbut willing to cooperate. I remember especially one session where Lowrie asked for\na criticism of the committee, or recommendation, what we could do to improve, and\nit was very open, everybody put in their two cents worth, but very \u2014 very open\ndiscussion. Praise for Lowrie as president, because his was a difficult job to bring\nthem together, and get them to work together and go in one voice to Vichy. Vichy\nwas not too cooperative. I think Vichy was not thought of very much by the French\nthemselves. They knew it was under the control of the Germans, that P\u00e9tain, Laval\nhad very little of independence.",
        "A: Met [indecipherable] Cimade.",
        "A: Well, the Cimade was set up by the French, what they call a fede \u2014 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\ndes \u00e9tudiants, a Protestant organization under Marc Boegner, who was head of the\nProtestant church in France, which 1s, of course, very much a minority in f \u2014 in\nFrance. And Cimade [speaks French].\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: And Mada \u2014 Madame Baro(ph), a very active lady who \u2014 she was probably in\nher 30s and was the head of it [indecipherable] Vesfal(ph), Dumas, some of the\nnames of people. And they would put students into the camps to set up a foyer with\nthe YMCA and with the European Student Relief Fund. So they had it in most of\nthe camps, not all of them, but Gurs and Rivesaltes, Les Milles,\nthey had students living in the camps, running the foyer and organizing various\nactivities for the internees.",
        "A: Andre Dumas was one, Madame [indecipherable] was another. And they\nchanged from time to time.",
        "A: I think they were with Swiss Red Cross, which was a big or-organization.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 well, he was a very active person, and had connections all over\nsouthern France, and had lived in France, of course, before, so he knew the\nFrench. He was able to get the functionaires(ph) to listen to him and do what he\nJune 11, 2009\nwanted. But he had that knack of approaching them and not \u2014 not challenging them\nreally, but getting them to listen to him, and then he never asked for more than he\nthought he could get, in getting permissions from the camps. And he couldn\u2019t do\nanything really to change the camps, but he could call to attention any discrepancies\nor any errors, or anything that were happening in the camps. And he had a very\npersuasive approach to the people, and very friendly always.",
        "A: Also had all kind of food cards. See, ev-everything was rationed.",
        "A: Who would what?",
        "A: The government. Everybody in France had to have coupons for bread, or for\nmeat. For instance, we got, I think enough meat for a month to make one good\nhamburger. So, was very little meat. There\u2019s a big difference between Germany\nand France, and of course Germany was taking all the food, except the fruits.\nFrance was a very rich agricultural country, of course, especially in the south, a lot\nof fruits and vegetables, so we survived pretty much on [indecipherable] and \u2014\n[indecipherable] and asparagus. But you had to have coupons for those. As I recall\nJune 11, 2009\none \u2014 one of the wives who [indecipherable] committee, Madame Lagalle(ph)\nwent to spend four hours at the market, and just got one [indecipherable] which\nwas not a great deal, but 1t was better than nothing. So the \u2014 it seemed that food was\nvery much the central part of our lives. And we were much better off, of course,\nthan those in the camps who were getting very little food. But you could always eat\nwell and \u2014 depending what part of France you were in. When I went to\n[indecipherable] which is another story, and there there was plenty of food.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I went back to Switzerland regularly. I would gain \u2014 go back to\nSwitzerland, gain five pounds and lose it the next time I went to France.",
        "A: Yes, Ross McClellan.",
        "A: Very pleasant person, very outgoing. Both he and his wife were very dedicated\npeople, good Quakers. A big \u2014 big fella, he was very imposing, which helped him a\ngreat deal.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Oh, I think there was food that was being brought in by a ship, and the Quakers\nwere distributing it. Mainly milk and flour.",
        "A: As long as food \u2014 the ships came in, it worked very well, but then the Germans\nstopped it. There weren\u2019t any more food being sent in from abroad, so \u2014",
        "A: Any children. It was mainly a-an attempt to improve the diet of the children in\nFrance, not just refugees, but all \u2014 all childrens. So distribution was throughout all\nof southern France.",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, we had built a \u2014 in the foyer, one end of the foyer, a stage, which\nbecame the theater, and \u2014",
        "A: Put on shows, plays, or musical events. Held church there.",
        "A: On Sundays, yes. Were very interesting groups, cause there\u2019d be maybe six or\nseven Germans, I mean, five or six Spanish, a couple of Poles. Three or four French\npeople. So it\u2019s conducted either in German or \u2014 or French.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Once in awhile.",
        "A: In French.",
        "A: Oh, it depends on the Sunday. Went off pretty well, because half the people\ncould understand French, most of them could understand a little French, but the\naudience was very mixed. So preaching or talking to them is \u2014 any distraction wa \u2014\nand anything di-different that was going on was \u2014 I mean, in a \u2014 not only\ninterrupted the service, but I remember one time when I was preaching, I don\u2019t have\nno idea what it was on, and this Spanish lady down in the front had her baby with\nher. About halfway through she began to nurse him, which for a young, 25 year old\nwas \u2014 it was surprise.",
        "A: Some distraction, yeah.",
        "A: Right. The Cimade was very big on Bible studies. It was very much a\nintellectual approach to the Bible. And of course, everybody was invited to come,\nnot \u2014 not just the refugees, but any other French people who were there. That was\nJune 11, 2009\none way of keeping the organization central in their beliefs and in their ideas, and a\nch-chance for exchange it as personal ideas, too.",
        "A: Oh, I think the difference between our two cultures, I mean the \u2014 the church in\nthe United States is a \u2014 at least the mainline churches have always had a very social\ngospel impact, where they felt that more than just religious ideas, but they should\nalso do something for people. Whether it was healthcare, or whether improve foods,\nor take care of people in prisons, whereas the French were much more intellectual\nin their approach, and \u2014 and the French loved to discuss, and to talk, a-argue \u2014 very\npleasantly, but also very intellectually, and I find \u2014 I found that they were way\nahead of us as far \u2014 intellectually as different ideas, which, even though I\u2019d had\ntheological training, I was not ready to discuss in such detail as the French were.",
        "A: Very stimulating. And after awhile it got little \u2014 not boring, but it got \u2014 because\nthey never seemed to finish their discussion. They\u2019d go on and stop in the middle of\na sentence, and everybody knew what they were thinking, so you didn\u2019t have to say\nanything, which was a very typical French approach to it. I enjoy \u2014 had very good\nJune 11, 2009\nrelations with all the memb \u2014 we have, every six months maybe, a big retreat of all\nthe workers, in \u2014 in the Cimade, that is. [indecipherable] in the [indecipherable].\nGo up for just three or four days of just relaxation and discussions.",
        "A: And skiing.",
        "A: Oh, I started skiing as a boy in Switzerland when I was 10 years old, so I loved\nto ski. Given it up now though, I haven\u2019t skied for 30 years.",
        "A: I remember he was trying to get out, like most refugees to \u2014 to the west, either to\nAmerica or South America or anyplace out of France.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t remember whether \u2014 I think he probably eventually made it,\nalthough our \u2014 our job \u2014 there was certain organizations that were specializing, like\nthe Unitarians, and the Jewish organization specialized in immigration, both \u2014 I wi\n\u2014Ican say it now, both legal and illegal. If they could get the permits to leave\nFrance, they had to have permits to get into Spain. And if they couldn\u2019t get them,\nJune 11, 2009\nthey would have students who\u2019d take them over the border, over the Pyrenees, or\ninto Switzerland. We had a number of students who were able to get into\nSwitzerland, like Hans Solomon and his five friends made it once into\nSwitzerland, got into the Valais, which is southern part of Switzerland, and were\nstopped at the Swiss border by the Swiss guards who were from that area, given a\nnice, big bowl of soup, and then sent back into France, cause Switzerland said\nthey just can\u2019t take everybody who wants to come to Switzerland.",
        "A: Eventually \u2014 eventually they got back into Rivesaltes, and then we arranged for\nthem to ge \u2014 try again, and not to go into the Valais, which was much stricter than \u2014\nthan say Geneva or Vaud. And eventually made it across, and we had visas \u2014 visas\nfor them, so that this time there\u2019s no problem.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We did, through the organization, yes.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Eur-European student, or through the Cimade. Cimade was very good at that, it\nwas one of their jobs, and they had young students who were acting as guides across\nthe mountains, so \u2014",
        "A: Very vaguely. Not \u2014 I\u2019d say we were not specializing in immigration \u2014 or\nemigration, but you couldn\u2019t help get involved in it.",
        "A: I think 1t was more of a practical approach to know that they \u2014 you wanted them\nto continue their studies, but that took a [indecipherable], a place to live and steady\nincome, which we co \u2014 we could not provide, I mean, we couldn\u2019t provide. We\ngave out very little money, as far as help, just in emergencies. And that was true of\nmost of the organizations, they tried not to just hand out money. But I thought, so if\nJune 11, 2009\nI recommend that they learn a trade, at least they can earn a living. What we did \u2014\nthe story of the Chambon is another, different story.",
        "A: Yeah, in ni \u2014 at the end of \u201941, we fi \u2014 figure that the students \u2014 we wanted to do\nsomething for the students, and there was a committee of the ESRF in France with\nProfessor Lagalle(ph) from \u2014 from Montpellier, who was the head of the\ncommittee \u2014 French committee. And we figured we had to get the students into an\natmosphere where they could really continue their studies. We looked over southern\nFrance, and a Mr. Guillome(ph) who was a \u2014 worked for the \u2014 a Frenchman who\nworked for the YMCA, been mayor of a little town Chambon-sur-Lignon\n[indecipherable] and so we went up to see Chambon, which is very up in the\nmountains, and a very rural area, and found out that they had a treme \u2014 there are\ntwo pastors there, Pastor Truckmay(ph) and Pastor try \u2014 Tise(ph), who are very\nmuch the leaders of the community, and they had already had a number of maison\nd\u2019enfants open at the Swiss Red Cross, that a couple may \u2014 where they could bring\nchildren and take care of them during that \u2014 in that manner. And the main difference\nbetween Chambon et \u2014 the whole area, the plateau and gau \u2014 and southern France\non the coast, was there was plenty of food there. For the first time in I don\u2019t know\nhow many months, I found butter. That sh \u2014 one ra \u2014 thing that struck me, I would\nJune 11, 2009\nsay made the decision that we should try and settle a\u2014 a home there was, Melby\nand I were looking for a hotel, or for a place where we could \u2014 for a place we could\nrent to put students into. We \u2014 and we [indecipherable] the hotel overnight, went\nout in the morning. And the people next to us had had [indecipherable] breakfast\nsent up, and they put it out in the hall, and there were two pound \u2014 two pat\u00e9s of\nbutter left on the plate, so Melby and I immediately scooped it up and decided this\nis where we wanted to be. So we did find a Maison des Roches, which the hotel,\nwe were able to rent it and then had to staff it with a director and somebody could\nrun the place.",
        "A: There was a miss \u2014 miss \u2014 Madame Pon-Pontay(ph), I think the names were.\nAnd then eventually Daniel Truckmay(ph), the nephew of one of the pastors took\nover. And over the year which we were in operation, there were about 75 different\nstudents who were able to take advantage of \u2014 most of them would \u2014 would come\nsettle down, or they would decide to try to go to Switzerland, or disappear into the\nMaquis, the resi \u2014 resistance. So it was, from that point of view, very successful,\nand we were able to, as I say, get about 75 students out of the camps, because this is\none thing the go-government, or the Nimes committee had pushed for was Vichy,\nget people out of the camps, and into a more or less normal living.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Chambon was very definitely a Protestant village.",
        "A: I think that [indecipherable] was a Protestant village, the whole area was\nProtestant, had been since the seven \u2014 15\", 16\" century, with the Huguenots. But\nthe fact that there were the two pastors here who were very supportive of our work,\nand are able to supervise the \u2014 the Maison des Roches.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I did, but not a great deal, I didn\u2019t have that much to do with him. I \u2014 I know 0 \u2014\nI meet all the commanders, cause you had to call, and then when you first went to\nthe camp, then you go in and just let them know you\u2019re here.",

        "A: I\u2014I re \u2014 of course, the conditions in the camp were always very mini \u2014\nminimum, and I think this was towards the end of \u2014 or in \u201942, where the conditions\n\u2014 the camp, you know, was on a beach, and the conditions around it weren\u2019t too\ngreat. Cold and windy and this particular time when I come back, I go and visit\npeople in the c \u2014 in the [indecipherable] or in the barracks. And \u2014 and th-this time I\nwent to the barracks, cause you could \u2014 they had a real black market going on in\nevery barrack, where if you wanted something special and you had money, you\ncould get it. In other words chocolate, or extra bread or something. But this time I\ncame back and people just looked worn out and tired and hungry, of course. And\nJune 11, 2009\nthey\u2019d \u2014 and they\u2019d lost any desire to do any we \u2014 or activities were very minimum\nbecause nobody had the strength to go to the foyer or read, or to play an instrument.\nAnd the men, particularly, were just starving away. And there was not a thing we\ncould do except just encourage them to try and make some plans, which was very\ndifficult, I mean, plan what their life, I mean, have a goal of some kind. And they\nwould just kind of pull the blankets up over them and just lie there. So those are\nconditions that, I don\u2019t know what anybody could have done to improve them\n[indecipherable] cause the food was [indecipherable], vegetables, nothing very\nsubstantial, it\u2019s one piece of bread, which made a very de \u2014 very depressing visit.",

So conditions in\ncamps \u2014 Rivesaltes was particularly depressing because of the heat, and the \u2014 not\nsand, but kind of rock \u2014 rocky soil. And overcrowded, of course. And then you\nnever knew when there\u2019s gonna be another exodus, or \u2014 then the Germans insisted\nthat the Germans \u2014 the Germans in the camp be sent back to Germany. It was kind\nof an interesting way in which \u2014 I suppose about a hundred thousand Germans were\nsent to France, cause Hitler gave the \u2014 the gauleiter, that is the heads of certain\nsections of Germany permission to just do what they wanted besides just get rid of\nthe Jews. So the one near the French border in southwestern Germany, so it\u2019s\nsimple, we\u2019ll just send them to France. So they shipped them all down to France,\nto Gurs, Rivesaltes, other camps. And then a year or so later they wanted them\nJune 11, 2009\nback. That\u2019s when the convoys started. Those pictures you saw were of a convoy\nbeing prepared, which was always a very dramatic time, because \u2014 well, Andre\nDumas, who was one of the head Cimade people in the camps, got to know the\ndirectors and the soldiers all much better than I did. And for one convoy he sat in\nwith the director and decided who would \u2014 I mean, not who would go, but whether\nthere was a discrep \u2014 whether families being separated.

The\nrefugees didn\u2019t know for sure where they were going, I suppose they had some idea.\nBut we\u2019d already by then learned about Auschwitz, so the dilemma was, can we\nreally decide that this person should not go, or should go? Now the director of the\ncamp had to make the choice, but that was his job.\nEnd of Tape One\nJune 11, 2009\nBeginning Tape Two",

As long as they had a\ngoal, whether it was just to live another day or so, and they could see some hope in\nthe future, I think that would encourage them to try and do something. But when\nthey just kind of give up and see no future at all, then that\u2019s very depressing, not\nonly for themselves, but for everybody else. Because there\u2019s really nothing you can\ndo, you can\u2019t give them what they really need, is more food, because you don\u2019t have\nit.",

Either\nthey\u2019ve lost a mate, or they\u2019ve just seen other people go re \u2014 go downhill, you might\nsay. And once that happens, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them back. And you can\u2019t do it\nJune 11, 2009\nwith just food, you have to give them some reason for living. And it\u2019s true they\nhave no reason for living, if they\u2019re gonna be sent off to Auschwitz. Why bother?",
        "A: Well, it makes you \u2014 well, 1t certainly makes you reflect on what you\u2019re doing,\nwhether there\u2019s anything else you can do. You can\u2019t give up hope on them, because\nthen you\u2019ve also gotten in the same situation that they\u2019re in. So it\u2019s a matter of\nmaintaining your own spiritual feelings and beliefs, that there\u2019s gotta be a better\nplace, and a better time. But you \u2014 if you can\u2019t see any future, I mean, France was\nin a very sad situation, economically and e-every way. And I think I found that\nparticularly true right \u2014 right after the big debacle, the French couldn\u2019t realize what\nhappened to them. They knew they had the biggest army in \u2014 in Europe, and it just\ndisappeared, dissolved.",
        "A: This was the difficulty, you would \u2014 everybody wanted to get out, and not\neverybody would put in a request for an exit visa, or for a visa from \u2014 and\neverybody had friends.

I said, well, if you can get him a visa, that the best thing you\ncould do. Well, even with all his connections, he couldn\u2019t get a visa for her. So you\nhad to tell a person, well, not now, but keep on hoping, keep \u2014 so it was not\nsurprising that people would try and walk out of the camp and head for the frontier.",
        "A: Oh, some were caught, I mean the \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many hundreds had tried\nto get across. But \u2014 well, even, for instance, a person with an American passport,\nand a visa like Ronald Elliot, who was one of the leaders of the World Student\nChristian Federation, came to visit. This was before America was in the war, of\ncourse. And he had an exit permit, and wi \u2014 so he came down to visit Rivesaltes,\nwhich 1s fairly near to the border. And we\u2019d showed him around and spend the day\nor so with him showing him different parts of the camp and situation. Then he got\non the train to go to Cerbere(ph), which is border into Spain, and was turned down\nfor some reason, they didn\u2019t accept his exit visa. So he\u2019d come back and we spent\nanother day with him, put him on the train again, about three times before he finally\ngot across.

        "A: Well the camps were not run 1n very fashionable, very military way, and the\nthing that \u2014 oh, I think I mentioned that Madame Jurano(ph), who was a Swiss\nlady, a very good friend from Switzerland down visiting, and she got so mad when\nthe \u2014 she went into the camp and there was the guard smoking, and talking to her\nwith cigarette in his mouth. And being the good Swiss, she felt that was disgusting.\nBut that was typical of the camps, I mean, s-sol \u2014 soldiers were not \u2014 they were\ncivilian guards, or soldiers, they just had no discipline at all.

        "A: Oh, they were. I mean, who likes to stand at a gate for eight, 10 hours? It didn\u2019t\nwork out too well, cause they\u2019d come one time and then not show up for another\nmonth or so.\nJune 11, 2009",

Eventually they\ncame to work in the \u2014 to work in the work camps. See, the Germans, or the French\nand Germans tried to put everybody \u2014 every male, into work camp, cause there were\nso many soldiers who were still prisoners in euro \u2014 in Germany, and they needed a\nlot of workers. In fact, some of our students were sent over to Brest, which was a\nbig submarine base for the Germans, and worked in the foundations there for a\nwhile, until some colonel, German colonel found out they were Jewish and sent\nthem back.",

And then, course I started\nthinking whether we should really get out, or we could \u2014 Lowrie, I know at one\ntime, wanted to leave right away and go back to the States, he wanted to get\ninvolved in the war effort. And I guess he found out it wasn\u2019t that easy to get out as\nJune 11, 2009\nquickly.

But at the time\nwe didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019re gonna be taken, put into camps, as the Americans in\nGermany were, of course were. But there they had the protection of the consulate,\nwe had no protection at all. And we could have joined the people in the camps.",

        "A: We decided to stay on, that we had a responsibility to work. And there was no, at\nthe time there was no outward expression from the Germans [indecipherable] still\nunoccupied. I think the thing that took it off was the French navy was down in \u2014 in\nthe Mediterranean.",

        "A: Oh yeah, because th-these were their friends. Most of the people had come\ntogether from Germany, and had shipped down here and known each other in\nJune 11, 2009\nGermany for years, maybe. And then for some reason one group was sent off \u2014\nsent back to Germany, and others was kept in the camp. And eventually the camp\nwas \u2014 I assume was completely liquidated.",

And then if at the last minute\nthere\u2019s a change in people, like if somebody intervened, or if somebody else had\ncalled Vichy with a name of a person they wanted to take off, or \u2014 and Vichy would\nrespond to the camp, they\u2019d have to take them off the truck.",
        "A: Oh, who knows? Hard to say. They had enough influence to \u2014 to get through to a\nminister in Vichy. It would take quite \u2014 quite a deal of influence, but then many of\nthese \u2014 many of the Germans had been functionaires, had been important people in\nBerlin or in Germany, and may have known the French deputies, or some \u2014 I\nmean, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was, but it could be any one \u2014 any reason.",
        "A: Truck. Then there\u2019d be somebody else who\u2019d be put in their place, which was\nreal dramatic cause they\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d say they cut [indecipherable] 150 people and\nstop there, the next 10 people in line would be sent back to the barracks, or be kept\nthere until the trucks left, if they didn\u2019t have to change. So it\u2019s \u2014 it was dra \u2014 always\ndramatic and tragic time, cause you hate to see anybody \u2014 anybody be taken away.",
        "A: Up to Paris, I think it\u2019s in Drancy where the camp was, and they\u2019d probably\nspend some time there, and then they go back to \u2014 then they\u2019d go to Germany.\nWhere they \u2014 which camp they went to, Buchenwald or Auschwitz, wherever they\n\u2014 or in some cases they were \u2014 if they were young enough, they go back to\nGermany and they put them under work camps. Because Germany needed a \u2014\nJune 11, 2009\nneeded a lot of workers too with the whole army out of the country. So you couldn\u2019t\n\u2014 you couldn\u2019t say for sure or not.",
        "A: Very somber. Very quiet. Nobody really felt like doing anything, because you\u2019d\nbeen pretty well drained just watching them leave. So what \u2014",
        "A: They what?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I suppo \u2014 I think there may have been a service of some kind,\nbut not necessarily. No, it was more or less just a complete let down when you work\nwith people for a number of months, and then some of them disappeared. I guess\nfortunately, we didn\u2019t know for sure where they were going.",
        "A: I think only a couple.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: No, I\u2014 they more or less transfer one camp to the other, and the camps are all\ndifferent. Gurs and Rivesaltes were probably the two big camps for German \u2014\nGerman refugees. Vernet was more of a political \u2014 political prisoners.",

        "A: Les Milles was right next to Marseilles and \u2014 and that was a more hopeful\ncamp, cause that\u2019s where they were \u2014 those who had their first papers in order and\nhad to get more papers would ca \u2014 go to Les Milles cause then they go into\nMarseilles, see the consulates and work on getting their final papers together, so\nthat was a\u2014 much more of a transient camp, even though very active with artists\nand \u2014 and a library.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall, I don\u2019t think so, no way. I don\u2019t think anybody knew because the\ngerm \u2014 Germans would make the decision, we need 150 or 200 or 300.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, you\u2019re never sure.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I knew the workers, I don\u2019t recall them at all particular. I knew they\nhad a good \u2014",
        "A: I did see them, and knew they had a good organization going. And they were \u2014 I\nthink they were mainly interested in trying to get these wer \u2014 young people into\nsome kind of a job work, or training for jobs.",
        "A: Children, yeah.",
        "A: You want to \u2014",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: Very much so, cause the Spaniards had been there for about three years, three or\nfour years, since the end of the Spanish revolution, and they\u2019d pretty much settled in\nand made their own position there in the camp.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: I'd say they did because they\u2019d been there longer, and they knew the way\naround. And th-they had no place to go either, they were \u2014 they weren\u2019t too\nwelcome in France, but there \u2014 on the other hand, they took care of them, the\nFrench.",
        "A: They must have had more, because they did their own cooking. I think I\nmentioned once that they invited me over to dinner, and they cooked Spanish rice\non an open fire out in the middle of the camp. And served a very good dinner,\nwhich I appreciated. Food was pretty much a central thought in everybody\u2019s mind\nall the time. But \u2014 so when you had a good meal, then the \u2014 made a lot of\ndifference.",
        "A: No, I just como estsa, that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: French, yeah. They\u2019d learned enough French by then to get by. But they \u2014 they\nweren\u2019t really internees so much as just residents in the camp, because I say,\nthey had no place \u2014 they couldn\u2019t go back to Spain.",
        "A: They were part of the leftist government.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: No, as I recall, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: They did, but not as thoroughly as we would have liked. They \u2014 they had pretty\nmuch their own life, and they pretty \u2014 and they were pretty well, so well established\nthat they had a family life.",
        "A: Having lots of children, and \u2014",
        "A: Some, yes, not \u2014 one or two of each. You\u2019d find a violinist or a guitar player\namong the Spaniards. But I say, th-they already \u2014 they\u2019d been there so long that\nthey were \u2014 pretty much had a routine to their own life going.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they would come to those.",
        "A: Once in a while, not \u2014 not a great deal, they \u2014\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Well, as I recall, the Spanish dances. They had more energy than the Germans,\nbecause they had, I suppose, better food that they prepared themselves. But, course\nthey wanted \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to get too settled in France, because they wanted to\ngo back to Spain eventually after Franco left. But tha \u2014 they didn\u2019t see any future,\nbecause they c \u2014 they knew they couldn\u2019t go back to France \u2014 to Spain without\nbeing put in prison or shot.",
        "A: Not too much, they had their own life pretty much, so \u2014 and again, they were \u2014\ndi-didn\u2019t have to stay, they could move out if they wanted. But again, they\u2019d have to\nearn \u2014 earn the living someplace, and like in most countries, they were never fully\nintegrated into the population. They had their own \u2014 own [indecipherable] and own\n\u2014 own life pretty much settled. It was a really mixture of people from all over,\nactually, Mediterranean area.",
        "A: Than anyplace else?\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: No \u2014 Gurs \u2014 Gurs was very active, except Gurs \u2014 my ma \u2014 main memory of\nGurs was the mud. It rained a lot up there, and once it rained there was no drainage\nin the camp, so you were wading in through mud. But that \u2014 that\u2019s what deterred\neverything happening in Gurs.",
        "A: Oh, you could buy paper, pencils, pens.",
        "A: Books, if you could find books, or they were donated books. Instruments, I\u2019m\nnot sure where they came from, but we were glad to have them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, no, well, the budget was for Marseilles, for France, but the money all came\neventually from Geneva.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: No, there are people you knew, having been there, and then the local French\ncommittees also would recommend students. Once in awhile there\u2019d be a French\nstudent that needed help, or needed to get out, get away. So the local committee\nwould do \u2014 run across students who needed help. Cause see, we were there to work\nwith all students, not just internees or refugees.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And they needed a boost up at this time, because jobs weren\u2019t too plentiful in\nFrance.",
        "A: Probably more a lower age limit. We needed \u2014 we weren\u2019t looking for high\nschool students, but there weren\u2019t too many of them anyway.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the top age limit, I don\u2019t think there was any stated limit but by\nthe fact that there weren\u2019t too many older \u2014 older students, say over 40. There were,\nI think a couple older men, by that they\u2019re in their 40s.",
        "A: Well, first you had to get the release from the camp, which means you had to\nprove that there was a place for them to go, and that they would be \u2014 not become a\ncharge to the state.",
        "A: Commander du camp. And then you had to get permission from the \u2014 for travel,\nof course, and then permission to settle in Chambon at the prefecture there.",
        "A: Chambon.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Take them out, or they \u2014 they could come on their own, like the five students I\nknew best just made their own arrangements. They\u2019d already had a \u2014 a border trip to\nSwitzerland, so they knew \u2014 well, most of them knew, pretty much, how to get\naround. And the train service wasn\u2019t too bad, it was slow, so they arrived pretty\nmuch on their own.",
        "A: I think \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s when the bulk of students seemed to have come, but there\nhad been some there a little earlier, once the camp had opened. Was a matter of\ngetting not the camp, but getting La Roche opened. Main thing was getting heating\n\u2014 heat for it, cause Chambon was cold weather and they were coming out of the\nwarm Mediterranean weather. So until you get it heated [indecipherable].\nFortunately it was well furnished. There were beds and blankets and everything else\nover there.",
        "A: Probably about 20 at any one time.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: No, I was just interested in getting it going, keeping it going, and \u2014 and it was\nour big wa \u2014 a big project for the European Student Relief Fund. Mel-Melby came\ndown a couple times from Geneva [indecipherable] not too far from Geneva.",
        "A: No, I\u2014 [I\u2019m just trying to think. I never thought of that before, probably not. I\ndon\u2019t know why, whether we never ran across girl students. Hard to say. No, I never\nthought of that before, that there were no girls.",
        "A: They stayed about a year as I recall, from January or February to the beginning\nof \u00b042. And then Truckmay(ph) came and took over afterwards. Unfortunately\nDaniel Truckmay(ph) was taken when the Gestapo raided the camp \u2014 raided the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the [indecipherable]. And Truckmay(ph) volun \u2014 actually volunteered to go\nwith them, and ended up in the concentration camp.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: It was my decision to go back to Geneva. That\u2019s when the Germans\n[indecipherable] the Germans going to take over all of France. So, as I recall, I\nwent \u2014 must have been November or so.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Nothing special, I had just had to buy a ticket and \u2014 and \u2014 and of course I had\nAmerican passport, which always helps. And I didn\u2019t \u2014 I had a permit de ce jour for\nGeneva, so I could always get back into Geneva.",
        "A: Well, the Cimade was still there, you see. Cimade were all French. And \u2014",
        "A: Andre Dumas, Per(ph) Griese(ph), Palos(ph). So the work continued for a long\n\u2014 I think the camp folded in \u201943, as far as the Germans were concerned, or the\nrefugees. Spaniards were still there.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Dubois?",
        "A: I remember the name, but I don\u2019t recall under what circumstances \u2014",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: I imagine from Switzerland.",
        "A: Oh ma-main work there was, well, of course there were refugees in Switzerland,\nhelping them get settled. But our main work was with prisoners of war, to identify\nstudents in the prisoner of war camps, particularly in Germany, cause we were in\nSwitzerland. But we were doing the same in Canada with German prisoners, and \u2014\nalthough I had nothing to do with the work in se \u2014 America. But we were sending\nbooks and identifying, putting them in touch with their colleges, when we found out\nwhere they \u2014 where they had gone to college, and whether \u2014 I was glad to run across\none who went to Yale or Oberlin.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: So that \u2014 so that \u2014 and I did that pretty much. Then I had another activity, you\nsee, there were a lot of American aviators who were interned in Switzerland, cause\ntheir plane was shot up and they couldn\u2019t get back to England, so they pulled into\nZurich, and of course, the Swiss interned them. But interned them up \u2014 then the\nSwiss tourism office was very dull in Switzerland there. Two Germans come in,\nbut nobody else, so the hotels were empty, so the Swiss put them up in a nice big\nhotel up in \u2014 oh, what\u2019s it called? Up in the mountains. So the aviators, once they\ngot over the shock of being shot down settled into kind of a touristy \u2014 touristy life.\nThey could ski, and they had \u2014 they were getting paid still by the embassy, or\ngetting it by the arm \u2014 air force.",
        "A: Chaplain.",
        "A: Protestant chaplain.",
        "A: Regular services [indecipherable]. And then any time pray if they were dead\n[indecipherable] we \u2014 Americans had a open cemetery in Miinsingen outside of\nBern, so we\u2019d hold a service for them there.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: I did in \u201944.",
        "A: After \u2014 and I did enlist and went \u2014 actually th-the American aviators couldn\u2019t get\nout of Switzerland until American troops had arrived on Swiss border. And then\nthey stayed [indecipherable] wanted to get rid of them, we get a \u2014 and they wanted\nto get back to England. So they brought in two \u2014 several planes, must have been\ntwo or 300. And I went out with them, went to England with them, flew out with\nthem.",
        "A: Enlisted then.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I went through basic training in England and in France and ended up\nin Germany in \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, I-I was on my first leave in Paris on May 10\"\nwhen the war was \u2014 the armistice was signed in Reims, which was a big\ncelebration. The Americans were very welcome then.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: No, infantry.",
        "A: No, I was \u2014 actually I was sent to \u2014 first to Marburg and a redevelopment camp\nor re \u2014 re-deployment camp, and I was there for, I guess four or five months. They\narrived there and they found out I could speak German, so they put me on the staff \u2014\nor not staff, I mean, transferred me to their \u2014 they wanted somebody around to\nspeak German. But then \u2014",
        "A: Just being a soldier. Not much of anything, we \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we \u2014 oh, we had \u2014 we had \u2014 no, as a re-deployment camp, the soldiers would\ncome in from all over Germany, being shipped home. And way \u2014 they spend\nmaybe five or six days there before they were sent home, off to Bremen, or take a\nship back. And then my transfer to Berlin, to military government and the\neducation department in the German youth \u2014 the German youth activities section.\nSo became head of the \u2014 see, Berlin, of course, was divided into four parts, and I\nJune 11, 2009\nbecame the head of the youth activities section for American zone \u2014 American \u2014\nAmerican section of Berlin.",
        "A: Yes. Not ru \u2014 well, I was for a while, then I went back and demobilized and flew\nback in as a civilian, which was quite a switch. I remember I came back on a troop\nship.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: After, oh yeah, so it was \u2014 must have been \u201945, end of \u201945. Cause I remember I\ncame \u2014 there was a freeze on hiring, so I had \u2014 couldn\u2019t get [indecipherable] right\nback. And eventually I had to come to Washington, and wait for transportation\nthrough the Azores. And I remember going out to the airport in my civilian clothes,\nand all these colonels and captains are on the same flight, and they all stood around\nand waited for me to go on. Here I was, I\u2019d been a buck sergeant, and I couldn\u2019t\nfigure out what this, after you sir. They didn\u2019t know what my civilian rank was, so\nthat was an interesting time.",
        "A: I went back to Berlin.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: I stayed \u2014 stayed until \u201949, came back to the States, got married, took my wife\nback with me.",
        "A: No, she\u2019s American.",
        "A: I met her \u2014 I met her in Berlin. She had been in Moscow for a year with the\nembassy. And we got tired of being cooped up in the embassy for work and for play\nand everything else, so she wanted \u2014 when she asked to go to Russia, she wanted to\nmeet the Russians, but she couldn\u2019t get out of the embassy.\nEnd of Tape Two\nJune 11, 2009\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Well, I'd been out of the States for 10 years, I figured time I got back, and I was\ninterested in getting into education, so I came back to Stanford for a year and got\nmy teaching credential.",
        "A: Oh, I was \u2014 I think I wanted something a little broader than just a minister, and a\n\u2014 and working in the educational branch in Germany, where \u2014 re-educating the\nGerman youth, I figure that education was the field I wanted to work in. So I came\nback and my wife and small baby and a German Shepherd dog \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: My wife was from California, and I had an uncle who was a superintendent of\nschools in Palo Alto or Menlo Park. And they had a house we could use for a year\nJune 11, 2009\nor so, while I was go \u2014 while I was going to Stanford, that\u2019s why \u2014 one reason I\npicked Stanford. It\u2019s a good school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Pretty much so. Not as much as I thought, cause I\u2019d been in touch with\nAmericans all along, and I\u2019d been in the army long enough to realize that what I\nmiss were all the little things that you forget about.",
        "A: Oh, about TVs. We didn\u2019t have a TV for a couple of years, so \u2014 for a number of\nyears. And of course, driving was no problem, but \u2014",
        "A: There was more traffic than \u2014 than in Europe, although I did have a car in\nEurope, but particularly around the big cities, traffic was heavy. Freeways were\nsomething new, although I\u2019d been on the autobahns in Germany which were\nenough of a problem.",
        "A: Right.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: Looking for a job, and I finally found one in [indecipherable] Coalinga in\nCalifornia, which is in the Fresno \u2014 central part of California, teaching world\nhistory to a bunch of kids who were growing up on farms in that area and were not\ninterested in world history, particularly, although a bunch of good students.",
        "A: French, a-and social studies.",
        "A: For three years, then went to Beirut, Lebanon, where I spent five years there at\nthe international college. And then after five years in the Middle East, I came back\nto southern California, to Garden Grove in \u2014 which is in Orange County, right\nnext to Disneyland, and stayed there 25 years. Became principal of a high school.\nCalifornia was growing so fast in those days that first time I went there, there was\none high school in Garden Grove, within 10 years there were seven high schools,\nwith all the feeding schools. So I was principal for 10 years in southern California.",
        "A: Andre Dumas, | stayed in, Lowrie I s \u2014 I stayed in touch, mainly through\nChristmas letters. But I lost track of some of them.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: I think it gave me a greater appreciation of people, understanding of people. I\u2019m\nnot sure it gave me any special skills, except I think I found that Americans are not\nvery much interested in Europe. Right after the war, they\u2019d had enough of the war,\nand \u2014 and [indecipherable] so, in matter of teaching, you tried to bring in the things\nthat had happened and their influence on their lives, but most people were much\nmore interested in getting jobs and buying cars and living.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I went so f\u2014 well, maybe I have [indecipherable] demonic\nforces, but a \u2014 I certainly realized that the world was not a peaceful place, and that\nin some ways there was very little you could do to make any changes. You could\nchange individuals, and that\u2019s why I concentrated on individuals and working with\nJune 11, 2009\nthem, whereas major changes were something that it was really very difficult. You\nrealize there\u2019s gonna be crises around the world. [indecipherable] I was talking to a\ngroup of \u2014 actually at a Holocaust museum in Philadelphia and \u2014 where Hans\nSolomon(ph) was \u2014 lives. And one of the questions after this [indecipherable]\ngroup of students who said, well, can the Holocaust ever happen again? The only\nthing I can say wi \u2014 look, there\u2019s enough \u2014 enough \u2014 enough problems already, wa \u2014\nlike dur \u2014 like all in the middle \u2014 in the Middle East and Serbia, crises like that, in\nnorth Africa. And I\u2019m not sure we settled all those yet. I ju-just hope that it never\ncan happen again on such a schedu \u2014 scale.",
        "A: Well, that was \u2014 that was a big step, cause we worked so long and hard we \u2014 for\nit, and then failed the first time to get the nod and then went back a second time. But\nI think when you see people actually in the situation where they\u2019re changing their\nlives, which it was, cause they could just as well have been on a convoy. Except\nthey were all young, they would probably not go on to a camp, they\u2019d go on toa\nwork camp someplace. But there\u2019s some satisfaction to know that you helped a few\nJune 11, 2009\npeople like that. It was a much more critical situation than today, and change came\nabout so quickly, too.",
        "A: They what?",
        "A: Yeah, it gi \u2014 gives you \u2014 you have to have some results, and some \u2014 I don\u2019t want\nto say victories, but some positive results, otherwise it becomes a pretty dreary\nworld.",
        "A: I saw him then and then I saw him earlier this year in Philadelphia. So it was\nkind of pleasant to get back there and talk with him.",
        "A: I think as I reflect back on it, I realize the very extraordinary times. That I was\nvery fortunate to be able to be in a situation where I could do some \u2014 some good,\nnot very much. But it gave me an appreciation of difficulties people have and that\nyou can do something, even though very small, just by giving a person a book, or\nJune 11, 2009\ncrayons, or artists. At least give them temporary relief from their situation. That\nwe\u2019re not gonna solve all the problems right away.",
        "A: Well, I felt \u2014 first, my letters to my parents, we\u2019ve always corresponded. And I\nfelt if I could at least open up with somebody, and give them some sense of my\nfeelings and my beliefs, that would help \u2014 help to go on to continue with the work.\nAnd the diary I just felt [indecipherable] this is a special time, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I think everybody\u2019s looking for somebody to express \u2014 to be able to sit\ndown and talk with, or just relate to, especially when you\u2019re 25 or 26.\nJune 11, 2009",
        "A: And th-the Cimade was a very good group from that point of view, and a \u2014 they\nwould meet with them regularly.",
        "A: Yeah, I think you begin to realize that people want to share, and always need\nsomebody they can open up to, and can talk to, and felt that through education there\nwas a possibility of helping people realize what they want to do. It becomes a very\npersonal thing after a while, looking for a warm contact with people.",
        "A: Yeah, I still have friends among the students that I knew. But also realize that a\nlot of the work in education is very temporary, and that you don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, every\nday is not a major day. A lot of days are very routine and that you have to get used\nto it. You try and break out of the routine and make a difference in people\u2019s lives.",
        "A: I appreciate the chance to be here and to talk with you about this, cause I felt ri \u2014\nwas looking over my diary, I realize that \u2014 what extraordinary times they were. And\nJune 11, 2009\nyou mentioned you might even think of publishing it, well I \u2014 I have trouble getting\nthoughts down now. I mean, as I say, my children want me to write memoirs, which\ntakes me time to get going on it; my computer skills are not too great. So, glad to be\nable to share this with you, and \u2014",
