        "Answer: Nothing?",
        "Q: This is one minute of silence --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- in our location.",
        "A: I have -- People, some of the people know me by four different first names. Why? How\ndid it happen? When I was born, I was born in Lithuania, in a city called Vilnus. My parents\nwere Orthodox Jews. They named me in Yiddish, which was -- the name was in my birth\ncertificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish, began with the name Labe. Labe in Yiddish\nmeans lion. It\u2019s a typical, Jewish sounding name. So, when we came to China, I was three\nyears old and I -- when I was about five, I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian\nlanguage and all the other subjects. I -- I didn\u2019t want to say that my name was Labe, because\nit sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and other things, I didn\u2019t want to be outstanding.\nSo when they asked me what my name is, I said, \u201cMy name is Lowah or Leve, which in\nRussian means lion. That\u2019s how I went through the Russian school. Then, when I was 17,\nmy -- my father told me, said -- advised me -- suggested that I go to studying in a British\nschool in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English language, which he said 1s important in order\nto get a job, in order to go ahead in life. So I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school.\nI didn\u2019t want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name, because it doesn\u2019t\nsound good. So I said my name, I became Leo, which means, in English, lion, same thing as\nthe other two names. And that\u2019s how I stayed, for many, many, many years, until, in 1948,\nbeginning of \u201849, we had to leave for Israel. When I came to Israel, I was drafted into the\narmy and when they asked me what my name was, I said, \u201cLeo.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, you\nhave to change your name, this is not a Hebrew name.\u201d He said, \u201cYou, from now on you\nwill be Arie,\u201d A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion. So, that\u2019s the same name and that\u2019s\nhow I stayed and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to change it any more.\u201d\u2019 When I came to America,\nArie, my social security is Arie, my driver\u2019s license is Arie, everything is Arie. Some people\nsuggested, \u201cGo on, change it, become Leo.\u201d I said, \u201cNo. Enough of that.\u201d I had some\nproblems by the way, when I was working on my visa to come to the United States, I was in\nTokyo -- I will tell you about it later. So, the -- the lady who was asking me questions, her\nname was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the American embassy, said, \u201c\u201cWhat is this, how can one\nman has to have four names?\u201d I explained to her, she says, ah, they don\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t -- I\nsaid, \u201cI tell you what. Ill bring you a letter from the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say\nthat these four names mean the same thing in different languages.\u201d That was acceptable.\nAnd that\u2019s it. That\u2019s how my name was.",
        "Q: And yet we know you as Leo?",
        "A: Yeah. But I -- M-My documents, my checks, my social security, everything, everything I\nhave 1s Arie.",
        "Q: But do your -- What do your children call you?",
        "A: Dad.",
        "Q: What did your wife call you?",
        "A: Leo. Leo, Leo, Leo. Sometimes when -- My wife also spoke Russian, it was -- it was\nLeve [indecipherable].",
        "Q: So it\u2019s all right if I call you Leo?",
        "A: Of course it\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: So if -- if you don\u2019t mind, if we could just back up a little bit and name your mother and\neven her maiden name.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And where she was from.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Okay. My mother\u2019s name was Rachel, her maiden name was Rachel Schwartz. She was\nfrom a small place somewhere in Uk -- in Bela -- in Belarus, 1n -- in -- in -- in Russia. My\nfather\u2019s name was Boris or Robert -- Boris, anyway, in Russian it was Boris. And my\nbrother -- older brother, I have an older brother, his name is David. He and his family live in\nNahartyya, Israel. My youngest sister, Sheelia, she lives also in Israel, in a place called\nGiv\u2019atayim, which is near Tel Aviv. They have extended families, nice children,\ngrandchildren, etcetera. Now, my children, yes? Rebecca --",

        "Q: And you nev -- so you never returned to Vilna after the war?",
        "A: Never, oh, never, no never [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay. And now let\u2019s go to your children.",
        "A: My children all were born in China.",
        "Q: And your wife, of course.",
        "A: And my wife. My wife, Rebecca, she was born in -- in China also, but not in the same\nplace where we lived, Shanghai. She was born in Harbing, which is another city in China.\nHer father, who -- he died very, very young. He was a soldier in the Russian army and they\nlived in Siberia first, in Russia, then when he died, they moved to China. And that\u2019s where I\nmet her.",
        "Q: She was Jewish also?",
        "A: Oh yes, Russian Jewish, her background. Her name was Rebecca Lubarski, Interesting\nhow I met her. She was a pretty young girl, about 14 or so, I was 17 or 18 and during the\nhigh holidays -- in Shanghai at that time, there was no synagogue -- during the high\nholidays, the Jewish community, our older people, got together and rented an apartment\nwhere they conducted the prayers for the Jewish high holidays, New Year and the Day of\nAtonement. And I -- I used to attend those services. At that time I was already working in an\nimporting firm in -- they -- they gave me a job. I clerk in the office to learn the business.\nThey were importing from England, from Germany, from Poland, textiles. Woolen textiles,\nthere was a big market in China for textiles. And from England they imported some\nartificial silk, printed with beautiful red flowers. And it -- 1t was nice red flowers and I\nremember it. And then when I went to these services one day, I saw a -- a young, pretty girl\nin a dress with a red -- that material that we imported. That was such a surprise. And I\nlooked at material and I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s our material.\u201d Then I looked at her. I said to a friend\nof mine, I says, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the girl I like to meet. I think I\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d And I did, six\nyears later.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Was a very interesting story.",
        "Q: Did you go over to her that day?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t go with her that day, I met her later in a -- in a organization for young\nJewish people. We met and then I started to take her out to the movies, etcetera, etcetera,\netcetera. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You had a courtship for --",
        "A: Oh yes, for a long time, about six years.",
        "Q: Six year courtship, wow.",
        "A: I was 17. Because in 1933, or \u201834 -- \u201833, the firm that I was working for -- that\u2019s the\nbeginning of another series of events which brings me to Japan, you see? They send me to\nJapan in 1937, before the war.",
        "Q: From?",
        "A: China to Japan, to open an office there.",
        "Q: With your family?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t married yet.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, wait a minute, 1936 they send me, I was married next year. \u201836 -- beginning of 1936,\nI went to Japan. I got married later in 1936, came back to Shanghai, married and took my\nwife to -- with me to Japan. The reason why the-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it\nwas a different Japan in those days, they started copying the British and the French textiles.\nThey used to get samples from overseas and copy them in the Japanese factories and prices\nwere much cheaper, so they said, \u201cWe want to import from Japan. Go to Japan, open an\noffice.\u201d I was only what wa -- what was it, \u201836? 19 - 13 - 23 years old. I opened an office, I\ndecided I have to learn Japanese because I\u2019m dealing with the Japanese. I used to get\nsamples, which I would bring to different manufacturers and they would copy it. Then I\nwould export this merchandise to China. And then that was -- that was that period, that was\n\u201836, then my -- my -- we corresponded with my girlfriend -- my -- my Rebecca and then she\nsaid, \u201cWell, it\u2019s about time we got married.\u2019 Whatever. So I came back to Shanghai, got\nmarried, took her with me to Japan in 1936 and continued with my job. In 1937, after nine\nmonths of marriage, my son was born. Now, my wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was\nvery concerned to give birth in Japan, she didn\u2019t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she\nwas used to her mama, you know. And mama was in Shanghai. So she told me, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the way you feel,\u201d I\nwa -- she was afraid, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I send her to Japan and there our es -- our son is --\nearly in 1937, March 29th, was born. She was in Shanghai, I was in Japan. And that\u2019s --\nAnd that comes another very interesting cycle in my life. Always in ways, my life is cycles.\nI was -- Because that brings me to -- to the Fuguclan. You know the book Fuguclan, you\nread it, didn\u2019t you? Oh, the story of the jap -- of the Jewish refugees in Japan, what I was\ndoing there. You know about that, don\u2019t you? If not, there is an article here.",
        "Q: I want you to -- to tell about it here.",
        "A: Well, we\u2019ll come back to this. I used to go to a small restaurant to eat over there, in\nKovay, in Japan, 1937. And I needly -- I knew mostly all the foreigners that live at that time\nin Kovay, was a small city. Small, foreigner communities, some British, some American,\nsome Germans, etcetera, etcetera. And I knew by face and by acquaintance, mostly all of\nthem. I belong to the clubs, you know. So, I used to go to the small Japanese restaurant\ncalled Kovay kitchen. And I was there, one day I see new faces. Never seen these people\nbefore in my life, they are in Japan. It really was very rare that foreigners would come in\nthose days, first of all. In those days you had no planes, you had to go by boat and as -- it\nwas --",
        "Q: Was there a Jewish community in Kovay?",
        "A: A very small Jewish community which was established in 1939, two years later, Ill tell\nyou about this.",
        "Q: But not when you came?",
        "A: Not when I came.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There was a synagogue wh-which I attended. I used to be quite religious.",
        "Q: There was a synagogue when you came?",
        "A: But not -- You see -- You know what the Ashkenazian Jews are and the Sephardic Jews\nare? There were about 50 Sephardic Jewish con -- Jewish people living in Japan in those\ndays, in Kovay. Jews from Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, North Africa, and a very few our\npeople, which we call Ashkenazi Jews. You know, some Russian -- mostly Russian Jews.\nAnd we didn\u2019t get organized -- we used to -- I used to go to their -- to the -- to the Sephardic\nsynagogue every Friday. They were organized better than we there, because we were -- very\nfew of us. Anyway, so, as I told you, I was in that -- in that restaurant and I saw three new\nfaces. I sat not far from them and as I was listening to their conversation, they were talking\namong themselves Yiddish, which was a very rare thing. I got very surprised, and very\nexcited, I came up to them. I speak Yiddish, I talk to them and, \u201cWhat do you doing here,\nwhat are you doing here?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, we came here to open an office. We are from\nPanama. We have an office in Panama.\u201d They\u2019re exrom -- originally from Romania.\nThey\u2019re now in Panama and interesting again. You know the name Curacao of course, the\nvisas that [indecipherable]. They had an office in Curacao, they had an office in Panama.\nAnd they were going to open an office because they were starting to buy a lot of\nmerchandise. Business was really good over there. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to open an office,\nwhat -- do you speak Japanese?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHow are you\ngoing to operate an office?\u201d \u201cWe speak Spanish, and of course, Yiddish.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, I\ncan speak Japanese, I can speak English. I will help you to open an office, to hire people.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d We\u2019ll -- Became good friends. I was not -- not busy. We became very, very friendly\nand I helped them to establish an office. Of course, I didn\u2019t want -- they offered me some\nmoney, I -- I refused. And we became very close friends. Three months later -- I think 1t was\nthree months later, yeah, May, my wife sends me this -- a telegram, \u201cI\u2019m coming home with\nmy s -- with our son.\u201d That\u2019s fine. So I came to the boys, I said, \u201cLook, no more going\naround the nighttime to the nightclubs and then doing things which we were doing, young\nfellows. My wife is coming home with my son. Goodbye, good luck.\u201d My wife came and I\ndidn\u2019t see them any more, from 1937 to 1939. In 1939, my firm transla -- transferred me\nback to Shanghai, with my son, my wife, went to Shanghai. He was three years old, went to\nShanghai and I was working there, in the office in Shanghai and one day I have a telephone\ncall. The guy speaks to me o-on the telephone, he speaks to me Yiddish. I said, \u201c\u201cWho are\nyou?\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me, we -- y-you -- we were in Japan, we went\ntogether. My name is Max.\u201d \u201cOh, how are you Max? What are you doing in Shanghai?\u201d\nYou know, in those days, this was not so simple. You couldn\u2019t fly by planes, 30 days by\nboat. It was -- It was a different wor-world. He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m here already three days and\nI -- I would like you and your wife to come. I\u2019m in the Park Hotel,\u201d which is one of the best\nhotels, \u201cI\u2019m here buying merchandise,\u201d which he was shipping to -- somebody shipping to -\n- to - -to Panama, to Curacao, \u201cand I want to talk to you.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cCome with your wife.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cOkay.\u201d Came with my wife, I [indecipherable] long talk, talk, talk. He says to me,\n\u201cYou remember there were three of us when you met us in -- in Kovay?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the third guy who was with us, was my cousin. He was managing our office in Japan.\nHe was having a hard time, he didn\u2019t know any English, he didn\u2019t know any Japanese and\nhe decided to go out on his own, to make his own business. We need somebody to run our\noffice. Would you like to come and work with us in Japan?\u201d 1939. War in Europe just -- just\n-- just started. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not -- I have a good job here, I\u2019m not intention -- I have a small\nbaby.\u201d So he smiled. Max was his name. He was about 20 years older than I was, a more\nseasoned guy.",
        "Q: His last name?",
        "A: Max -- Max Becker.",
        "Q: Becker, okay.",
        "A: He puts his hand in his pocket, like this, I remember, in his pocket inside his jacket. He\ntakes out a paper. It was an agreement, made by a lawyer, with me. He knew so well that\nI\u2019m not going to refuse his offer. When I opened the agreement, I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nIt was about five times as much money as I was making. It was tremendous offer, I got\nexcited. Besides, all may -- sou -- may -- my expe-expenses in Japan, paid by the office. A\ncar and a driver and a cook and the apartment, everything, beautiful. I said, \u201cShake.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cOne condition. I'll shake hands with you, cause you see, this a contract between me\nand you.\u201d I say, \u201cYes, what is the condition?\u201d \u201cCan you write Yiddish? All our\ncorrespondence has to be in Yiddish, because we don\u2019t know English, we don\u2019t know\nRussian, we don\u2019t know Japanese, you don\u2019t know Spanish. So there is only one way we\ncan correspond, Yiddish.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know how to translate.\u201d \u201cYou got a job.\u201d And\nthree months later, I left my other job, I took my wife, my son, Kobe. Kobe --",
        "Q: That was you -- you went to Kobe now?",
        "A: That was in 1939. That\u2019s the time -- you questioned about the Jewish community, we got\norganized in 1940 or so. Iam working for Max, he\u2019s teaching me buying, really tremendous\namount of merchandise. Had about 20 Japanese, an office and -- was a beautiful job, easy,\nbut responsible situation. The name of the firm was Curacao - Panama Trading Company,\nbecause there was -- we were shipping goods to Panama, to Curacao, to Peru, to Chile.\nSouth American countries with [indecipherable] everywhere. You know, it was a different\nJapan in those days, it was not a -- the time of wa -- Japanese radios, television sets, cars,\netcetera. It was toys and textiles and shoes and -- and underwear and -- and -- and blankets\nand tablecloths. All those things we were shipping there. And he says, \u201cI'll stay with you\ntwo months, Ill teach you.\u201d Of course, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know that merchandise, the\npricing and everything. He stayed with me and that was the time, beginning of 1940, when\nthe refugees -- the story of the refugees you know, they were coming with the Japanese\ntransit visas, started to come in. So, my good friend -- later, I was working for him in Japan,\nMr. Ponvy, he was there.",
        "Q: You worked for Mr. Ponvy and the same company\u201d?",
        "A: Yes -- na -- at that time, no. I worked for Ponvy after the war. In \u201851, I came to -- back to\nTokyo, that\u2019s another story. He was a very fine man, a leader, an organizer. And one day he\ncame to me on a Sunday. H-H-He needed a secretary in a Jewish community to -- of course,\nhe didn\u2019t know any English correspondence where we thought our organization, he says\nwe're going to get organized.",
        "Q: Where was he from?",
        "A: He was born in Russia. His name was Ponivairski. In 1941, beginning before the war, he\nemigrated to the United States and he changed his name from Ponivairski to Ponvi. Mr.\nPonvi -- Anatole was his first name -- was a wonderful man. A real leader, a real organizer\nand I was his secretary. I mean, not paid of course, just in the community. He says, \u201cWe\nhave to organize the Jewish community.\u201d There were about 20 our people, Russian speaking\nJews. We made a meeting, we got together, we organized. [indecipherable] organize, the\nfirst thing to do, you have to rent a place -- a place of worship. That\u2019s the first thing you do,\nand have an office. We\u2019ve got to organize. Ponvi, he organized every -- he was a wonderful\nman. I think one day, on a Sunday, I remember, he was -- he came to my house with a\ntelegram in his hand in English. This was the first telegram signed by six names from\nLithuania -- from Kalmus, Lithuania. German sounding names. \u201cWe German Jews in\nKalmus, Lithuania need Japanese transit visas. We are on our way to Argentina. The consul\nhere told us --\u201d the consul was this man, Sukihara, \u201ctold us that we can -- he -- he can give\nus transit visas if Jewish community in Kobe will guarantee our stay here. Financial support,\npolitical standing, etcetera, etcetera.\u201d That was in 1940, be -- be -- middle \u201840. So, I went\nwith him into the police station. The -- We -- They were taking care of all our affairs. And\nwe told them, here is a telegram, we -- they said, \u201cWill you guarantee?\u201d \u201cYes, we guarantee,\nwe --\u201d We had a stamp. We -- Already we\u2019re organized, had a stamp. We guarantee. These\npeople came. After about two weeks or so, they came with Japanese transit visas, but they\nhad visas -- final visas to go to Argentina. I never met these people.",
        "Q: Now, these would be signed by Sukihara?",
        "A: Yes, this -- these were the first visas Sukihara signed. Then, the Polish situation started\nwhen Poland, in 1939 was invaded by Russia from one side and by Germany from the other\nside. Many Jews from Poland, many from Warsaw, Krakow and other cities escaped. They\nwere afraid of the Germans, they were afraid of the Polish and where could they go?\nLithuania. At that time, up north in Lithuania, Lithuania was an independent country. And\nwhere you find Jewish community there who could -- who -- they knew that they would\ntake care of them. And they started smuggling themselves over from oc -- places occupied\nby the Polish one side or by the German on the other side. And they went -- That was before\nGermany attacked Poland -- Russia. They -- It escaped to Lithuania. And then they started\nthis Curacao visa story. You know the Curacao visas, on the strength of which, the Japanese\nconsul Sukihara was giving them transit visas, which we started getting telegrams, 10\npeople, 20 people, 100 people. Eventually we brought, with those visas, over 3,000 people.",
        "Q: Now, before we go too far, I\u2019m trying to weave in your own family life, alongside the\nstory of the community.",
        "A: Well, my wife was -- we -- w-we -- when the Jewish committee was organized, of\ncourse, I was busy. After office, I used to go there and there were telegrams, letters, we had\nto -- I was the only one who could speak and write in English. There was correspondence,\nwith Jewish organizations all over, and people started to come from Poland. And they knew\n-- especially the religious people -- there were about a thousand religious people, rabbis and\nstudents, rabbinical students, organized in different groups. They would come for all their\nproblems. They would come to me, because I was the only one who could understand them.\nYoung as I was, they would come to me and I\u2019Il tell you some other stories which are very, I\nwouldn\u2019t say comical, but interesting, because they had their own problems, in spite of the\nfact they were refugees. Well, then our women, our wives, including my own Rebecca, got\norganized and they started to help the refugees, they had children. Children used to get sick,\nyou had to take them to the hospitals, they spoke Japanese. So, they were helping them.\nAlso, they started collecting clothes. Some people came naked, nothing on them. They\nstarted to collect clothes and give it to them and this was -- in -- in the evening. Then, when\nwe got organized, under Mr. Ponvi\u2019s guidance and instructions, we got together and we\nrented a home, which we came -- on the ground floor was a synagogue, on top was offices\nand a kitchen. We hired some people, our women taught the Japanese chefs how to make\ngood food, etcetera. And we were going there almost every day, especially the women, to\nplay Mah Jong and to play cards and that was a social --",
        "Q: Was it kosher?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, it wa -- it wasn\u2019t kosher.",
        "Q: Now -- Now, in this same time period, did you have more children? When did your\nchildren come?",

        "A: Now, as I told you, the firm I was working for, Max Becker, was Panamanian. It was a\nforeign company under Panamanian flag. And I used to talk to Max and -- when he was t-\nteaching me how to -- mainly to buy the goods and the qualities and you know,\n[indecipherable] a lot of merchandise. And he says, \u201cI\u2019m going, you are ready. I ca -- You\ncan take it over.\u201d Then one day I said to him, \u201cMax, wh-where is your family, where is your\nfamily? Where is your father, where is your mother? You have any?\u201d He says, \u201cYes.\u201d I\nsays, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d He says to me, \u201cThey are in Romania,\u201d in Bessarabia, which is part\nof Romania. I said, \u201cMax, bring them over here. I mean, look what\u2019s going on. Hitler 1s\nmarching all over the world.\u201d That was before Russia was attacked by Germany, 1941 --\nJune of 1941. He says, \u201cMy father is an older man,\u201d I don\u2019t know how old he was. \u201cHe\u2019s\nvery Orthodox, he lives with my mother and my two sisters and I asked him many times to\nleave Romania, Bessarabia and to come and we\u2019ll work something out.\u201d He says, \u201c\u201cWhere\nwill I go? I don\u2019t know any languages.\u201d Shows me letters, he corresponds with his father, in\nYiddish, of course. \u201cWhere shall I go? My home is here, my business is here.\u201d \u201cWhat kind\nof business --\u201d He was buying and selling some cows and -- and -- and -- and what do you\ncall, sheep. And -- And I said, \u201cMax, the ground is -- 1s burning under the -- under the\n[indecipherable] under the legs of our people. They\u2019re Jews.\u201d He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m asking\nthem to leave, they said they can\u2019t go.\u201d I said, \u201cTell them to come here to Japan, same way\nthe other refugees are coming. I will take care of them and we\u2019ll work something out, but\nget them out.\u201d He says, \u201cLook, I --\u201d and he shows me letters he writes to them, was about\nsix weeks before he left. He says to his father, \u201cI still insist and I want you to leave with\nMama and the two sisters, 15 - 16, and come here to Japan.\u201d Well, so he -- His father writes\nto him, \u201cYou -- I think you ha -- must have gone out of your mind. I should go to Japan, an\nOrthodox Jew like me? What am I going to do there?\u201d You know. I said, \u201cMax, tell him, if\nhe decides to leave, let me know. I don\u2019t know how, what we -- I will do, but I will -- we\u2019re\nbringing thousands of Polish Jews, we\u2019ll bring them out somehow. And then wa -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t want to worry about what\u2019s going to happen then.

He left back to Panama and I was standing there and then\nGermany attacks Russia, in 1941. Russians occupy Romania, which at that time was\nindependent country, Bessarabia, under Soviet occupation.

        "A: -- 1942, when the war started, \u201841. Have I told about that, I don\u2019t remember? Anyway, I -\n- if I repeat myself, it\u2019s alright. During -- 1941, December the eighth, Pearl Harbor, I was in\nKobe with my wife and my son. I was working for the Panamanian firm, I remember I told\nyou. When Panama declared war on Japan, the military came to my office, it was a\nPanamanian, enemy firm. I was not -- I was a stateless immigrant without any documents,\nwithout any citizenship. I had my permit to come to Japan because I was working there.\nEvery six months I had to renew it and it was no problem. My son, who was born in China,\nbut also stateless. My wife was stateless person. Anyway, in 1942, when Panama declared\nwar on Japan, the firm became enemy firm. The military came and they put stamps on the\nsafe, whatever merchandise I had there, whatever money, everything was arrested and I was\nleft with-without my payment, without money, without anything, because, you know, it was\n-- it was running. And they said, \u201cLook, you are not an enemy subject, but the firm you are\nworking for is enemy, so we have to -- to take these steps.\u201d They put seals on the safe and\nwhatever. And they said, \u201cYou can do what you want.\u201d And that was in December of 1942.\nIn February, things were getting very difficult. Food was hard to get. Everybody was\nrationed, not only foreigners, Japanese also. And I remember so well there were rumors, fish\nis going to be distributed. So I remember so -- twice, I got up at four in the morning, run to\nget in line for the fish. By the time my turn came at seven o\u2019clock, no more fish. It was a\nhard time. My wife, my child, who was -- Israel was at that time, \u201837, three years old -- four\nyears old. So, I had family at that time in Shanghai, my father and my mother. My wife\u2019s\nmother and her sister and other family members were in Shanghai, so they wrote us letters\ncoy -- thing was more or less normal, it was just the beginning of the war, before Japan was\nbombed and all that. And we decided we\u2019re going to go. I decided I have nothing -- I have\nto make a living somehow. I took my wife, my son, and we went to Shanghai.",
        "Q: And where did you live?",
        "A: We lived -- My sister\u2019s -- My wife\u2019s sister had a -- lived in a very large ho -- house. And\nshe just -- There was for her -- her husband, who was -- he was a French guy. And she had\nrooms there and we -- she invited us to stay there, sharing all the expenses, whether it was\nrent and food and everything, and that\u2019s where we lived. And making a living was pretty --\nyou know, it wasn\u2019t -- jiha -- it\u2019s hard to explain, 1t was an open market, an open black\nmarket. You could get any merchandise from this guy -- this guy had this, you could sell it.\nAnd this is how we made a living, buying, selling, and it was going on all right. Organized\nlife was pretty good, the Jewish community was pretty good and strong. We had our club,\nwe had our synagogues, we had our libraries, hospitals. It was okay. And then my s -- my\ndaughter -- my daughter Miriam was born in 1943, during the war. My wife said, \u201cLet\u2019s\nhave another baby.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s hard, war-time.\u201d She wanted it. Okay, she was right. Of\ncourse, sh-she is the apple of my eye now. She is looking after me, my daughter. The\nwomen are always more attached to their fathers than th -- th-than the men are. My sons are\nalso good to me, I\u2019m very grateful. Anyway, Miriam was born, we call her Mimi for short,\nin 1943 and then the war was over. Then we were -- we just managed. There was no clothes,\nthere was a little bit of a -- I don\u2019t know if you read about, or heard about it, the -- on the --\nJa-Japanese were allies with Germany. Under German influence, the Japanese military were\nprobing -- were thinking of, under German influence and pressure -- there were about\n20,000 Jews that escaped from Germany, Austria and Poland, came to Shanghai. They\ncould come there without any visas, they just would came -- be-before the war, including\nthe 3,000 Polish Jews that we saved, brought to Japan and then they came to Shanghai. And\nthey -- the Japanese, under the pressure from the Germans, decided to take all these stateless\nJewish Germ -- who came out in \u00b037, and they put them in the ghetto. You heard about this?\nIn Shanghai ghetto? They didn\u2019t take us, they only took those that came before -- after \u201837.\nThe reason for this, I still don\u2019t know if it -- 60 years went by and why did the Japanese\nhesitated to do to us what the Germans did? After all, the Germans were already getting\nready for the Holocaust you see, and --",
        "Q: And why -- why do you think 1937? How did they choose that date?",
        "A: Who? Why did what?",
        "Q: How did they choose the date, 1937?",
        "A: Who choose the date 1937? Oh, why the Japane -- because that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the date when -\n- when the Japanese and the Germans signed their military alliance, number one, and\nnumber two, many, many Germans, Jews and Austrians were allowed to come openly to\nShanghai. They came by boats and they came -- except those that came by Japan, that we\ntook care of, you see? And they put them into ghettos, from 1943.",
        "Q: Okay. So we\u2019re in *43 and you\u2019re in Shanghai?",
        "A: Shanghai.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you were when -- when the war ended?",
        "A: I-In \u201845, when the war ended, we were in Shanghai, yes. And when the war was over, we\nwere, of course, happy and relieved because some American planes bombed Shanghai. Not\nwhere we lived, but where the German Jews lived, in the honque Japanese areas. But that\u2019s\nwhere they ja -- I thing American military thought, or whatever it was, I don\u2019t know the\nreasons that they had some factories that were making materials for the war effort. Anyway,\na few bombs fell in those areas and they killed a few hundred Jewish refugees, the American\nbombs. That was one of those war stories. And 1945, the war was over, the Americans came\nand I had in my mind all the time, China is a huge country. Now, there\u2019s no more Japanese\noccupation, it will open up and there\u2019Il be a lot of business to be done. So, I knew where my\n-- Max Becker and -- had an office in New York. I knew [indecipherable], and then five\nyears went by. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to write him a letter,\u201d telling him possibilities of\ndoing business in Shanghai, and I suggest that we send this and this and this kind of\nmerchandise.",
        "Q: You had not been working for a company all this time?",
        "A: I was only for myself [inaudible] with my father and my father was in the -- 1n the -- in\ntextile retail business, he was selling people suitlinks for wearing -- woolen textiles. So, the\nfirst American plane I remember, with American pilots came, about 30 of them. I don\u2019t\nremember -- they had a special name. They landed in Shanghai. We were so excited,\nAmericans are here. And the Japanese were surrendering. We would rather they surrender to\nthe Americans than to the Chinese, because we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be with the\nChinese. Communists were fighting Hatsunists, you know. Was a ver -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nanother world. I wrote a letter to them 1-1n New York and I couldn\u2019t mail it because there\nwas no communication. So I mi -- took my bicycle -- in those days, w-we all had bicycles\nbecause cars were not -- expensive and not available. I pedaled to the hotel where I knew\nthe American flyers were and I came in there. There was a big sergeant,, I remember so\nwell. \u201cHello, Sergeant.\u201d \u201cYes, sir. What can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cLook, here is a letter. I\nhave to mail it to New York. I can read it to you what I write there, because it\u2019s in a foreign\nlanguage,\u201d it was in Jewish. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t care, the war is over.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t mail it\nbecause there is no -- no mail yet, no communication.\u201d He says, \u201cWe are leaving tomorrow\nfor Honolulu. Pll mail it for you.\u201d I said, \u201cSir, thank you, how much this is?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want\nany money.\u201d Anyway, he took the letter, I was very grateful and then about three, four\nweeks, I get a telegram from New York. Already communication started to -- excuse me --\nand he says, \u201c[indecipherable] we received your letter and don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re old friends\nand we\u2019ll send you the merchandise and you'll be all right. We\u2019ll send you and I will give\nyou credit,\u201d and etcetera, etcetera. Anyway, to make a long story short, from 1946 to 1948,\nMax send me a lot of merchandise, open account. And business was fantastic. Was making\na lot of money. Then one day, he came to check out. Of course he was sending me a lot of\nmerchandise, I owed them a lot of money. Of course, I paid everything, everything was all\nright, under control, I had papers. Well, he wanted to see what\u2019s going on and I don\u2019t blame\nhim, it was his money. He came, I met him and I don\u2019t know if I said so -- if I said that in\nthe old tape, about his parents, what happened to them, did I say that? You recall?",
        "Q: Th-They were killed.",
        "A: They were killed by the Nazis.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He -- He knew about it, he came, and that\u2019s another story. Anyway, business was good\nand he says -- we continued it with the business and he went back to Panama and I stayed in\nShanghai and everything was going fine until the rumors. First of all, the Americans left.\nThe Shanghai international concession in those days, was partly occupied by the American\nMarines, by the British army. They left. And we knew that the Chinese are fighting, the\nCommunists and the Nationalists. And we -- The newspapers, we got information that the\nCommunists were winning the war and they were advancing toward Shanghai. No, in 1948,\nbeginning of 1948, I was working and I was conta -- connected with one of the refugees that\nwe helped to come from -- I made quite a few friends 1n those that we helped, you see? And\nsomehow, they wanted to pay me back, I think. One guy asked me to work for him and they\ndidn\u2019t offer me any money, of course. If they did, I wouldn\u2019t have taken it. And one was -- I\nwas working for him, he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English, but he was a very bright man.\nAnd he says to me one day, \u201cThings are getting worse and worse, you know, the ja -- the --\nwe hear the Communists are advancing. They\u2019re already in Nanking, which is six hours\nfrom Shanghai.\u201d And they were all leaving. He comes to me and he says, \u201cWhat about you?\nWhere are you going?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere, I like it here.\u201d I was making\ngood money, I have a wonderful apartment, my wife, my -- my three children. He says,\n\u201cYou are going to go to America.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat?\u201d And, in my mind --",
        "Q: Who said this to you?",
        "A: One of the Polish refugees that I was helping him in doing his business, cause he didn\u2019t\nknow any English, there was -- he says to me -- and he -- he says, \u201cYou are going to go to\nAmerica.\u201d I sa -- I say, \u201cI -- I -- I\u2019m not going to go to America, I mean, I -- I don\u2019t want to\ngo anywhere, I\u2019m here.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are going to go to America, we\u2019re all leaving. This\none is going to Israel, this one is going to Australia, thi -- I\u2019m going to America, I --\u201d he\nsays, \u201cCome with me.\u201d I say, \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cWe go to the American embassy. He took me in\nthis --",
        "Q: What year was this?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He took me in the car to the American embassy, it was still operation -- before the\nCommunists occupied Shanghai and I got there application for a visa to go to America,\nwhich I filled 1t up and gave it to them. Then, the Communists started advancing and we\nwere all talking, what shall we do? Business is finished, stopped. The Chinese are fighting\neach other. What to do? 19 -- In May of 1948, the state of Israel was established and we\nwere, of course, very happy, we were celebrating and then everybody\u2019s leaving. They were -\n- were -- My wife says, \u201cLeo, we -- we got to do something, we got to leave and -- three\nchildren.\u201d I say, \u201cWhere are we going to --\u201d",

        "A: Oh, he was born in \u201848.",
        "Q: In Shanghai?",
        "A: In Shanghai. Yeah, in nine -- beginning of 1948. So -- And then our people got together\nand they said, \u201cWe were going to -- the state of Israel 1s established, we\u2019 ll -- let\u2019s send a\ntelegram to the newly established government there, telling them that we would like to\nemigrate to Israel, because nowhere else we can go.\u201d We were stateless people, without any\nnationality. And we send them a telegram. And sure enough, they send a man, by the name\nof Mr. Yowell, he was a consul and they started registering us, organizing us, who wants to\ngo to Israel? So, we went the first. My wife, myself, we went, registered ourselves and about\n800 of us got together and they send a ship after us, the Israeli government. It was a\nPanamanian ship, under Panamanian flag. United Nations somehow got involved with the\nstate of Israel and the United States, I don\u2019t know. Anyway --",
        "Q: Remember the name of the ship?",
        "A: Yes. Wooster Victory. And we\u2019re going, packed everything. And the Communists are\nstill not in Shanghai, they came six months later. But things are terrible. Mobs of Chinese,\nhungry, no business, and demonstrations, all kind of things. I said [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Who was demonstrating?",
        "A: Chinese people. They were poor, they had nothing to eat.",
        "Q: Against?",
        "A: Against themselves, against us, against foreigners, demonstrating. They were yelling in\nChinese, I don\u2019t know what they were yelling. Someone\u2019s -- Banks had to close. Everything\nbecame very disorganized. There was -- Nobody\u2019s in charge.",
        "Q: Chaos.",
        "A: Chaos. Nobody\u2019s in charge. So, the Wooster Victory came and we were allowed to take\nout anything we had. I remember packing the piano and the carpets and the --",
        "Q: So, it was the United Nations that paid for the passage of everything?",
        "A: I think United Nations or was it Jewish or Jewish organizations, I don\u2019t know. I know the\nflag was Panamanian flag with the -- with a -- captain was a Greek, the crew was Italian. It\nwas a nice ship, but one of those ellessgees that was -- became a -- that could carry people.\n800 people it was.",
        "Q: And the a -- the -- most of the people were of what nationality?",
        "A: It was the -- About 90 percent were German and Austrian and Polish Jews. The rest were\nus Russian Jews. And we -- we -- we went from that ship, the first ship.",
        "Q: So you felt very lucky to have that?",
        "A: We were very lucky just to get out, just to get out. Also, another thing I had in my mind,\nI knew the relationship -- it was during McCarthy time, I think -- before McCarthy time, and\nI was Russian born. I wasn\u2019t kosher, as far as the American government was concerned,\nbecause -- I also -- there was a time when I had a Soviet passport. I took out a Soviet pass --\nbecause I had no papers, nothing, which I gave up when I came to Israel.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the reason that maybe you didn\u2019t get a visa to America?",
        "A: I thought that if I stay back and become under Communist occupation, maybe at that\ntime there will be difficulties to get a visa to go to America, they will ask me why. Why did\nyou stay? Maybe you were sympathizing with them. In those days, it was a different way of\nthinking. I say, \u201cWe are going.\u201d So we came to Israel. It took us about 52 days in that ship,\nWooster Victory. We couldn\u2019t go by Suez because there was war between Egypt and Israel.\nWe had to go to Singapore. From Singapore the ship went to South Africa, Cape Town,\nWest Africa, Dakar, Italy -- Italy, Marseilles, France. We were picked up by a Jewish ship\nby the name of Negbar, Israeli ship came and picked us up in Italy.",
        "Q: That\u2019s Marseilles?",
        "A: In -- In Negbar, in Italy. In -- In -- What was this, na -- not in Naples. Got a city in a -- in\nItaly. I forgot. They came after us, of course.",

        "A: From Israel, a ship, and --",
        "Q: So they met your ship in --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t meet the ship. We came on -- on the -- on the -- the -- on that United Nations\nship, the Wooster Victory, to Italy. And we had to get off the ship and the Negbar was\nalready waiting for us. There was -- Somehow there was communication between people on\nthe ship and they were there. They\u2019re waiting for us. And in general -- I think it was in\ngeneral. Anyhow, we came to Israel in 1949. Was it *49 or \u201848? I don\u2019t remember. \u201849, I\nthink. End of \u201848.",
        "Q: And may I ask you how you were treated as a refugee from China?",
        "A: Where?",

        "A: Ships were coming full every day, were coming from all ar -- and it was -- 1t was a --\nmost -- now, the Israeli government that time, just green and new, young, they were treating\neverybody the same way and they were just say -- they organized certain camps in tents by\nthe thousands. They would put people over there and I don\u2019t know about the food, because I\ndidn\u2019t want to go to the camps. I had enough money, I had small children. And we went to a\nhotel, stayed in the hotel and then we went -- I had some friends there who were there 10\nyears ago, went from China to Israel as -- as a -- pioneers They met us, they were friends\n[indecipherable] and the guys I went to school with. They helped us out and I had -- as I\nsaid, I had the money. And stayed in a hotel and bought a condo in Haifa and was -- took\nabout three months that year it was built. And --",
        "Q: So, you lived in a hotel for three months?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Expensive, but had no choice. And one of my friends, he was a truck driver and he said,\n\u201cLook, I have a good idea. A lot of refugees are coming in from Europe, from Germany,\nfrom Poland, fra -- those that remained alive and they need storage facilities, for they\u2019re\nbringing with them -- they stayed a year or two in -- back and they were buying furniture\nand goods and machinery. And th-th-they\u2019re coming in, they can\u2019t put 1t into camps where\nthey -- where they had the -- the -- what do you call it? Tents. They have to take storage\nsomewhere to keep it and we will organize a storage company.\u201d And trucking and storage, I\n-- | liked the idea. He says, \u201cI have a truck, you have the money, we\u2019ll put it all together.\u201d\nAnd we rented a hou -- a -- a warehouse and we started working.",

        "Q: You didn\u2019t feel pressured to be one thing or another?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Nobody would -- pressured me, nobody.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. You had a very different experience, I think, from -- from a lot of people, that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m asking this from you [indecipherable]",
        "A: I see. Here again, you know, it was interesting. My time when I was helping some of\nthese Polish immigrants, Jews from Poland, when they came via Japan, eventually, on my\nrone road, they would -- somehow I would meet some of them and they never forgot how\nkind we were too them, how good we were to them. And one of them is instrumental, I'll\ntell you this story in a minute. I don\u2019t know if I told this already. If I did, how I -- why did I",
        "Q: Pll tell you, if you did.",
        "A: Why did I have to leave Israel and go to Japan, in *40 -- in \u201851?",
        "Q: Ah well, before we leave Israel, is there -- is there anything else about your personal\nexperience? I know you had lots of friends who helped you and you had --",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t help me, because I had the money and I had -- I needed contacts and --\nand [indecipherable] by the way, when I came to Israel, the first thing I did, I went to the\nAmerican embassy. And I said, \u201cI applied for a visa in 1948, would you please contact, and\n--\u201d No, before I left Shanghai, I went there and I said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving for Israel. Would you\nplease send my file to Tel Aviv, to Israel? They did. I came to Tel Aviv one day after we\ncame there. It was there, and they asked me, \u201cDo you want to continue on your work on the\nvisa?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d We\u2019ll let you know, and that was it. I didn\u2019t see them any more, until\nlater. So --",
        "Q: Before we leave Israel, I wanted to ask you -- I know you have a -- a strong sense and\nhad a strong sense of being Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But, how about the religious aspects of your faith? Did this contribute to a strong sense\nof your belief, your faith? Your spiritual life?",
        "A: It\u2019s a good question. I wasn\u2019t really very religious, I mean I was what you call my\nheritage -- my -- growing up at home, in a Jewish home, big -- be -- my wife was a very for\n-- come from a very, very assimilated Russian family. She didn\u2019t know anything about\nJudaism, very little. Kosher, forget about it, she was not interested and I was also not so\nmuch -- course, I knew, my children had to have Bar Mitzvah and that I followed all the\nway through, and -- but the big holidays, I used to take my wife, my children, we go to the\ntemple. But at home, you know, in America, when you think about Judaism, I\u2019m sure that\nyou are aware of the fact that there are Orthodox Jews, Conservative Jews and Reform Jews.\nIn those days in Israel, there was no such a thing. There was Orthodox. And for me it was a\nlittle strange, those people with the long beards and the -- I didn\u2019t believe the -- I didn\u2019t\nbelieve I belonged to them, because I was -- I didn\u2019t ever wear a hat and -- and I didn\u2019t keep\nkosher at home. I know my father would have been upset with me if he found out, but that\nwas my life, [indecipherable] busy. Anyway, in 19 -- we were working, we had that\nwarehouse and wa-was making -- making a living and until in 1951, after two years\nworking, \u201c49, \u201c50, \u201851.",

        "A: In Israel.",
        "Q: Where? In what? A house? A condo, you said.",
        "A: Haifa. No, a condo -- in a condo. Things are not doing so well and I speak to my friend,\nmy -- my partner. I says to him, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something, because we are not making\nenough for a living. He says, \u201cI tell you what we do, we have to go and buy a truck, another\ntruck. And we\u2019ll hire a driver and things will be all right.\u201d I was in charge of the warehouse,\nhe was in charge of the transportation, you see?",
        "Q: Do you have any idea why, as you look back on it, why things were not going well? For\neveryone, or just for your business?",
        "A: It was beginning of a state that starts it to build itself up. And first of all, I didn\u2019t know\nthe language too well to go and get a job, you see, if I wanted to. I didn\u2019t know Israel --\nHebrew too well at that time. Why didn\u2019t go well? The economic situation was not so very\ngood and people -- it was a different -- a different way of living in those days. Everything\nwas -- food was very strictly rationed. You have to be a professional man in order to get a\ngood job, an engineer, a doctor. I wasn\u2019t -- I was a businessman. That\u2019s why, I think. But, I\nwas still hoping that things will be all right. Now, in the meantime, we were living in Haifa.\nIn Tel Aviv -- I used to go there, about two hours by -- by car, once in awhile to visit with\nmy friends and so forth. And one of my friends, whom I helped him in Japan. Very int -- I\nhave to tell you this story, I don\u2019t know if I told that, but it\u2019s a very -- he\u2019s responsible for\nme [indecipherable] yesterday. His name was Yaglem.",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: Yaglem, a Polish Jew. When I was in charge -- when I was secretary of the Jewish\ncommunity in 1940 - \u201841, when the refugees would come in --",
        "Q: In Kobe.",
        "A: In Kobe. The Japanese police gave us strict instructions that refugees, they allow them to\ncome for two weeks, transit, but we extend it afterwards, their visas, that they were not to\nhave their documents with them in order not to allow them to travel if they wanted to go by\ntrain to another city, see? In Japan. And so, I had to have -- in my office, in the community,\nI had a big safe and all the documents, I -- we insisted when they come from the ship to\nsurrender them, I would register them and I was looking through them. One day I look,\nYaglem, Yaglem. We used to import merchandise from Poland from Yaglem when I was in\nShanghai. And there he is, the same Yaglem? I don\u2019t know. I started to check, \u201cWhere is\nMr. Yaglem?\u201d They said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s not on the -- this -- the community supervision,\nhe\u2019s a well-to-do man, with his wife and children. They\u2019re in a big hotel and they are there. I\nsay, \u201cI\u2019m going to go and see him.\u201d",
        "Q: This is Tel Aviv?",
        "A: No, that was in Japan. When they came to Japan, where we brought them from Poland,\nLithuania, Poland, Japan, that was Yaglem among the refugees. Am I making myself clear?\nWhen I saw the name Yaglem, he was a refugee from Poland in Japan. I went to see him in\na hotel. I came to the hotel, Oriental hotel, and there, I said, \u201cWhere is Mr. Yaglem?\u201d\n\u201cThere he is.\u201d And I see it\u2019s a man, well-dressed, his wife, children. I came up to him. I said\nto him, \u201cA-Are you Mr. Yaglem?\u201d He says, \u201cYes.\u201d I says, \u201cWhen I was in Shanghai, we\nused to go -- import goods from Yaglem.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s my factory. You imported\nfrom me.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOh, very good.\u201d He started to cry. I said, \u201cMr. Yaglem, what\u2019s the\nmatter? What are you crying?\u201d He said, \u201cI lost everything, they took my factory away, and -\n-\u201d T said, \u201cBut look, you\u2019re here in a hotel. That means to say that you have means. You are\non your way somewhere, I don\u2019t know where. You can tell me about it and if there\u2019s\nanything I can do to help you, with paperwork, with permits, just let me know. I\u2019m the\nsecretary of the Jewish community, I can help you.\u201d He s -- He\u2019s -- We spoke and we\nbecame very close and he says, \u201cI need to extend my visas for 10 days.\u201d I said, \u201cGive me\nyour documents and I\u2019|I take your documents.\u201d And I went and I extended it for -- for a\nwhole month and I did very good. Anyway, I don\u2019t know what happened. Then the war\ncame. I\u2019m talking now about 1940 -- \u201841, you see, when I met Yaglem in Japan. Then, he\nleft. I understand he was in England during the war.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Leo Hanin, conducted by Ginger Miles on\nJanuary 22nd, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.",
        "A: Okay, now? So, when we came to Israel, in 1949, I found out that Yaglem, whom I last\nsaw in Japan in 1940 or \u201841, is also in Israel. I went to Tel Aviv -- it\u2019s a small country, very\neasy to find people, I found him. When he saw me, he didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\n\u201cI\u2019m here. I have a factory, a woolen factory. It\u2019s already doing well.\u201d He says, \u201cIf there is\nanything you can do --\u201d\u2019 I said -- he says, \u201cLook, you helped me.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s all right,\nfor -- don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re here. If there is anything you can do,\nyou\u2019re a refugee. I\u2019m doing well, Pll help you.\u201d I said, \u201cFine, fine, fine.\u201d And every month\nor so, I used to go to see him in Tel Aviv and we were good friends. He [indecipherable] his\nfamily. Then one day I get a telephone call from him, from Tel Aviv to Haifa. He says,\n\u201cLeo?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d He called me Leo. He says to me -- we spoke Russian -- he says to me, \u201cDo\nyou have a partner by the name of so and so, Danny?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d I never told him about\nit. He says, \u201cCome [indecipherable] Tel Aviv, I have to talk to you about something very\nserious.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He calls me from Haifa to Tel Aviv. If he says, I am\ngoing. I came. He says, \u201cLook, I have bad news for you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cDid you people buy a truck just recently, you and your partner?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, how do\nyou know?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201chow much you pay for this truck?\u201d I said so much and so\nmuch. He says, \u201cYour partner stole from you 600 pounds.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat are you talking\nabout?\u201d He says, \u201cHow much did you pay for the truck?\u201d I says, \u201c3,600 pounds.\u201d He says,\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cI was in a cafe in Tel Aviv and I heard three people talking between\nthemselves and they mentioned your name. When they mentioned your name, I am there.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cLook, you\u2019re talking about Mr. Hanin, he was in Japan, he helped me and the whole\nstory.\u201d He says, \u201cYes, we heard about him, that he is a fine man and all that, but this partner\nbought a truck from us for 3,000 pounds and he asks us to make the receipt for 3,600\npounds.\u201d And 600 pounds, which was a lot of money. In those days I needed a hundred\npounds for a -- living a month for the whole family. He says, \u201cYour partner is a thief. He\nstole from you 600 pounds.\u201d My heart went down. I\u2019m new in this country, just started a\nbusiness, what am I going to do? And I went back home to Tel Aviv -- to Haifa, I told this\nto my wife. \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I cannot work with him any more,\nhe\u2019s a ga -- he\u2019s a -- he\u2019s a thief. A partner, a friend.\u201d Anyhow, to make a long story short,\nhe was a smart guy. He found out that my face, he could read my face if something was\nwrong. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, I didn\u2019t know what to do, until finally he says, \u201cYou\nmust tell me what happened.\u201d I said, \u201cDanny, what are you asking me questions. How much\ndid you pay for the truck?\u201d He says to me, \u201cWh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\nstole from me 600 pounds. You\u2019re a thief.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d And he ran away. I ran\nafter him. I said, \u201cDon\u2019t run. Come, we\u2019ll work it out, we\u2019ll talk it out and we\u2019ll find a way.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He came back, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody that I did that. If you tell them that I s-s-\nswindled you -- some of our friends, I am going to report you to the police, that you\nchanged some money on the black market.\u201d Which I did. It was very strict in those days. I\nchanged, you know, I had to live, you know [indecipherable]. He says, \u201cIll put you in jail,\u201d\nand it was very strict. I says, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do that. You can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s\nblackmail.\u201d He says, \u201cPll put you in jail, then.\u201d I got scared. I closed the office, I ran to an\nattorney. I said, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cyou have any papers? You signed any\npapers with this man, your partner?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, we did it by sh-shaking hands, we are good\nfriends.\u201d He says, \u201cYou\u2019re a fool. You don\u2019t do such things in -- in Israel. You have to come\nto a lawyer, then you\u2019re covered.\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019Il see what I can do.\u201d And in about six\nmonths after he ne-negotiated with him and we [indecipherable], I closed the office,\neverything is finished, I\u2019m go -- I go -- I ga -- I went and I got a job in the Israeli customs, I\nwas a customs brok -- customs agen -- not a agent, emp-employee in the office in\nbookkeeping.

I went to the soo -- this -- this promissory notes went to the bank. I\nhad them discounted because I had to pay to the bank, I borrowed money for the truck.\nAnyway, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s an involved story. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m giving you so many details.

So I got a telephone call from the bank that the first one,\nwhich was due on February the first, or whatever it was, it was paid. The other ones not\npaid. I see and say, \u201cI finished with the guy, he stole all my money.\u201d So, I\u2019m sitting and\nworking in my office and he comes in, my partner, who I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t see him for all this\ntime. He comes in with a guard, a guard brings him in because in customs, you had to have\na permit to go and see [indecipherable].

He opened a big store on the main street in\nTokyo, Ginza. Only a few foreign firms, American, British, French, were allowed to import\ngoods in those days. Japanese were not allowed yet. It was before the peace treaty was\nsigned in 1955, I believe. MacArthur. And so he -- he needed someone to help him there\nand he -- he s -- he send me a telegram. He says, if you want to come and work for me in\nTokyo, you\u2019re welcome, I\u2019Il send you a visa.

If you don\u2019t take him away to Switzerland or somewhere to breathe fresh air, he\u2019s\ngoing to die here.\u201d Well my -- my wife, myself, we were very, very upset. And it so\nhappened my wife had a sister who was married to a Swiss guy and they lived in\nSwitzerland. So I send a telegram, I said, \u201cLook, my wife has to come to Switzerland for\nabout six months while I go to Japan.\u201d And they came back and they said come on down\nand my wife and my daughter -- she took my daughter and Danny, the little guy, to\nSwitzerland.

That was a rule in Israel. So she left to Switzerland with the two children. I went\nto Japan to work for Mr. Ponvi and Israel stayed behind with my wife\u2019s mother, she looked\nafter him until he had to go to the army, which he did. He was in the 56 year war.

        "Q: Why he was aloof?",
        "A: Why he was giving those visas after he was instructed by the foreign office to stop\ngiving the visas. I don\u2019t know if you read the book, it\u2019s called, \u201cIn Search of Sukihara.\u201d Try\nand get it, it\u2019s a very interesting story. Dr. Hela Levine made a complete research. He went\nto Japan and he spoke to his children and he spoke to his widow and -- very interesting\nstory. And only one day, he finally, after I was pushing him -- he was really aloof. He was\nnever friendly with his own Japanese people. This a -- you know, the man was a diplomat.\nThe man spoke so many languages. The man -- I think what was in his mind -- he lost his\njob.",
        "Q: For what he did?",
        "A: For what he did. Why did he do it? I wanted to find out. He told me once, I will never\nforget this, he says, \u201cIt was the finger of God.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, I saved\nthose people because I had an inspiration I must save them.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I\nsays -- \u201cI -- I -- I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d He never, never, never talked to me about. I\nhope when they make the exhibition, I can give them some information which it might be of\ninterest, you know? Anyway, \u201851, I am in Japan, I went to the Japanese -- to the American\nembassy in Japan, and said, \u201cMy file is in Tel Aviv, bring it over here, I\u2019m now in Tel Aviv\n-- 1-in Tokyo.\u201d A few months later I\u2019m getting a call, \u201cYour file is here.\u201d I went. And that\nwas about three years they were asking me questions. It was during McCarthy times.",
        "Q: Who was asking you?",
        "A: A lady in charge, Miss Pinard was his name. She was in charge of the visa section.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u201cWhy -- How come y-yo-you speak Russian?\u201d I said, \u201cI was born there.\u201d \u201cAre you a\nCommunist?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cProve it to me.\u201d You know, she was a -- well, she was doing\nher job. And Miss Pinard was her name, very nice lady, but I understood, it was\n[indecipherable] her job. \u201cCome again, we\u2019ll talk to you again.\u201d And again and a -- and I\u2019m\nnot in a hurry. I have a good job -- of course I -- my mind 1s, my son, my oldest son 1s in the\narmy in Israel and then if I stay in Japan with the younger children, having a har -- easy\ntime, I\u2019m making good money, a good living. When he\u2019s finished with the army, I want him\nto go to college, I want him to study, and my children also. There\u2019s nothing to do in Japan, I\nhave to go to America. Where else would I go to give my children an education?",
        "Q: Did your family from Switzerland come back?",
        "A: No, no, no. My wife was in Switzerland with the two younger children and then, after six\nmonths or so, I brought them to Japan, to stay with me. I was working in Ponvi, she came\nwith the children. We had a very easy life, very good life, very comfortable life. And finally,\nMiss Pinard, every month or so, a telephone call. \u201cMr. Hanin, I want to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cAre you a Communist?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, I -- then I got a little upset, I said, \u201cMiss\nPinard, you know, if I were a Communist and if I want to go to the States, would I tell you\nthat I am a Communist? Let\u2019s change places.\u201d She says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cI am\nnot a Communist. I tell you what Ill do. I'll swear on the Torah,\u201d you know what a Torah 1s\n-- \u201cthat \u2019'm not a Communist. Is that good enough for you?\u201d She says, \u201cYes.\u201d I said,\n\u201cAnytime. I have a lot of good friends.\u201d And -- But she says, \u201cWell, come again.\u201d And I\u2019m\nnot in a hurry. I-I\u2019m working, I\u2019m still young. I -- I -- We\u2019re doing all right, making good\nmoney, putting it away. Finally, one day, after this interrogation, I came to a lunch -- we\nused to get together, some of the boys, some business people, friends of mine, in a nice\nhotel. I came there and who comes in? Maury Sprung. Maury Sprung was a major in the\nUnited States Air Force during the war. After the war was over, he was an attorney. And,\nwhen the war was over and they had a -- a -- a -- a court case against the Japanese criminals,\nyou know, military, also some of the industrialists were taken to be investigated and Maury\nwas their attorney. And he helped them to get -- get off the case. And he was a good -- n-\nnow -- now he started his own practice. Where did I meet him? I met Maury in the\nsynagogue, he was a Jewish guy. He was a major, [indecipherable] without uniform.

What\u2019s the matter with you, are you crazy?\u201d I said,\n\u201cMaury.\u201d \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d he says to me. \u201cI just came from the American\nembassy.\u201d \u201cWhat were you doing in the American embassy?\u201d I say, \u201cI am applying -- I am\nworking on a b -- am -- on a visa to go to the United States, and this lady over there is\nasking me so many questions. Am I a Communist and this and that.\u201d He started to laugh. He\nsays, \u201cLeo, don\u2019t worry. Ill take care of everything. You need a good lawyer.\u201d I say, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t need any lawyers. This is clear.\u201d He says -- Am I repeating myself, I didn\u2019t tell this\nstory. I say, \u201cMaury, I don\u2019t want to talk about it, I\u2019m so upset, she\u2019s asking me all these\nquestions every time.\u201d I say, \u201cWell, she\u2019s doing her job, what can I say?\u201d He says to me,\n\u201cWait for me, I'll let you know.\u201d Couple of months go by, he calls me up at home -- and he\nused to come to my house for dinner sometimes, my wife -- we\u2019re very good friends.

Takes us around, brings us in, it\u2019s dark little bar. And there were people sitting there,\nnobody\u2019s in uniform. And he\u2019s doing a lot of legal work for the American occupation, for\nthe military, that\u2019s what I understood. \u201cGeneral So and so,\u201d he says to a guy sitting there, \u201cI\nwant you to meet my very good friend, Leo and Rebecca Hanin.\u201d [indecipherable] They\u2019re\nall sitting there, nobody\u2019s eating any food [indecipherable] party, it\u2019s a nightclub.

And besides, it has to do\nalso with finances. I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t a rich man, but if I sell this condominium, I would\nhave some money to be able to make my own decisions what to do next. And I listened to\nthem and I\u2019m glad I did. We moved here, in Woodland Hills. I am living in a retirement\nhotel. Not an old age home, a retirement hotel.",

        "Q: All right.",
        "A: It\u2019s on my 85th birthday in -- in a magazine printed in Tel Aviv, in Israel. \u201cLeo is a\ndevoted family man. Proud, justly so, of his children, grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren. Throughout his life, Leo had been a committed Jew, a leader in the Jewish\ncommunity, a devoted friend of Israel, a generous person, a faithful friend. In a way, always\nready to respond to the needs of others.\u201d I mean, 1-it\u2019s not a matter of -- I was not -- I told\nmy -- my Eddie, my grandson that married a Catholic girl, a very nice girl, Michelle. And I\ntold my children, if it\u2019s going to be a wedding in a -- in a -- in a church, if he\u2019s going to\nconvert, this grandpa is not coming. \u201cWhy? Eddie will be bra -- ba -- heartbroken.\u201d I said,\n\u201cLook, I cannot, just --\u201d So they arranged, they had an interdenominational wedding and she\nis a lovely girl and they live well together and that\u2019s it. This is America, I understand. I am\nnot that old-fashioned to -- to -- to -- to be so, how shall I say, crazily -- I understand. My\nmind is open.",
        "Q: I wonder if your children understood what was happening in the Holocaust, since you\nwere not directly there. Did you tell them, or --",
        "A: I -- You know, the first tape that I made in -- in the museum --",
        "Q: 1990.",

Th-They read, especially the grandchildren I\u2019m talking about. They were brought up\nin -- in -- not in a very Orthodox Jewish way, but you know, th-they know -- th-they know. I\ndon\u2019t know if they\u2019re as -- as committed as I would have liked them to be, but this is\nAmerica.",
        "Q: And when you -- when you say, this is America, do you mean it\u2019s a mixed bag, there\u2019s\nall sorts of religions?",
        "A: We -- We -- No, I say -- That\u2019s right, we have to be open minded, we have to understand\nthat America, and I\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m [indecipherable]. To me, America, there\u2019s\nno other place in the world like America. And I think I understand many things that are\nhappening here good and bad. I\u2019m not going to talk about what\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s\nhappening today, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- has nothing to do with my life. But I understand all that and\nsometimes it hurts. But sometimes I -- I have to say to myself, \u201cWell, this is America.\nThank God the Jewish people in America have a good life.\u201d There is some anti-Semitism\nhere, I know. Farrakhan 1s here and other things are happening, but no country in the world\nhas been so good, so open and so understanding, with all the other problems that America\nhas been and for this I am grateful.",
        "Q: I wonder if you are a member of any Jewish organizations?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You\u2019re very -- You\u2019re considered a friend of Israel and --",
        "Q: Well, yes, we have an organization here, a small organization called American Far\nEastern Society of Southern California. All ex-residents of China, la -- an-and already their\nchildren got together here. There is an organization here, San Francisco, New York, Brazil,\nHong Kong, Japan. And the main purpose is to get together and to make some drives and\ncollect some money to help our older people who are destitute out in Israel. We send it to\nthem and New York sends it to them and -- and there is about 200 people in Israel, ex-\nresidents of China, Jewish people, who are completely out. They\u2019re in old age homes and\nthey are supported by us. We have to help them.",
        "Q: A question I\u2019m asking everyone 1s, do you think that the founding of Israel has a\nparticular, special meaning for Holocaust survivors?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think that -- of course, I didn\u2019t speak to many Holocaust survivors. I\ndidn\u2019t speak to them, but I read a lot about it, all these stories, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and all the\nother movies, etcetera, etcetera. And I think that many Jews, survivors of Holocaust had\nnowhere to go, only to Israel. No other country -- America accepted some, Australia\naccepted some, but mostly they came to Israel. And where -- where would they have gone if\nit wasn\u2019t for the -- for -- for Israel? That\u2019s the way I look at it.",
        "Q: IL have a list of events that I\u2019m also asking people that we interview in America. If you\nwill just mi -- look at it and I think that the thing that I heard you talk about the most was\nthe era of Joseph McCarthy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how it affected you, but I\u2019m wondering if your experience as a Jew during this time,\nwas as strongly -- also, did you -- were you able to relate it to any of these events that\nhappened, mainly in America?",
        "A: Japanese concentra -- Japanese -- Do we want me to go through all of them?",
        "Q: Oh, just whatever you relate to, not -- not -- not all of them.",
        "A: Well, we spoke about Japanese concentration camps, right?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The Cold War. The Cold War is -- was strictly war -- Cold War between American\ndemocracy and Communism, which had to be resolved, there was always the danger of -- of\n-- of war, only the na -- Russians were accumulating all these nuclears weapon -- nuclear\nweapons, with which they -- America was for them an enemy. That was -- That\u2019s the way I\nlooked at it. And when Soviet Russia became no more, | think -- I think it\u2019s a good thing\nthat happened.",
        "Q: In a -- In a -- I guess what I\u2019m talking about is -- it -- were you -- were you directly\naffected by any of these? If not, then --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no --",
        "Q: That\u2019s really the --",
        "A: The era of Joseph McCArthy and the Red scare. Well, the only thing I can -- I was never\ntold that it was because of Joseph McCarthy\u2019s s-situation that my visa was delayed for so\nlong, but it was part of life, an ex-Russian, speaking Russian, must be a Communist. You\nknow, it was -- I think it was implanted in the -- in the heads of the -- of the United States\nembassy employees, tha -- to -- to -- to cro -- to check it out, because Rosenberg\u2019s -- at that\ntime the spies, the Jewish spies that were co -- there were two who were executed. It was a -\n- it\u2019s a difficult situation, whether this should have been or not, I cannot make my opinion,\nbecause I am not -- first of all, I was not at that time an American citizen to really\nunderstand what was going on.",
        "Q: And as far as the Civil Rights movement, did you have any particular identity with --",
        "A: When I was here?",
        "Q: The way Blacks were treated in America?",
        "A: Well, in -- in -- in Los Angeles and where we lived here, we didn\u2019t see that much anti-\nBlack, what do you call it, attitudes. We saw it on television. We saw it -- what happening\nthe southern states and the marches that organized by Martin Luther King and th-the dogs\nthat were put on them and the people that couldn\u2019t work, people -- Black people couldn\u2019t\ndrink water and go to the bathroom and all that kind of thing. It -- It -- It -- It bothered me,\nbut I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know the Black people too well, to really understand what\u2019s -- what\u2019s\ngoing on. Cause I think the Blacks that are in the south are different than what they are here.\nThey\u2019re here, they are more integrated, don\u2019t you think so? It\u2019s -- It\u2019s a difficult problem.\nYou see, Id like to say to myself that after all my experiences and all my life, that I am an\nAmerican, but I am not, really. I co -- I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t born here, I didn\u2019t grow up here,\nand I sometimes listen to my children, to my grandchildren, the way they talk. I see they are\nAmericans. I am still -- who am I? I don\u2019t know. Russian, Jewish, Japanese, Chinese, I don\u2019t\nknow. My head is mixed up.",
        "Q: How many languages do you -- did you once and do you now speak?",
        "A: Five. I start with Russian, Yiddish, English, Hebrew, some Japanese and -- not fluent,\nsome Chinese, not fluent. And I picked up some German in school and when I was dealing\nwith the Polish refugees, I picked up some Polish.",
        "Q: This is way back to something that you -- you said, which I\u2019m very -- I think would be a\n-- a curious -- an interesting thing to know. At the time, you couldn\u2019t talk about the Black\nMarket, about the kind of activities --",
        "A: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where, where?",
        "Q: When your partner threatened you.",
        "A: Yes, in Israel.",
        "Q: It was in Israel.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you tell me, was that a typical kind of under the table business that was going on?",
        "A: A -- A lot of people that came from abroad in those days, knew -- knew immigrants that\nhad dollars.",
        "Q: American dollars?",
        "A: Yes, American dollars, in -- in -- not in their pockets, cash, but in accounts. I\u2019m talking\nabout Jews from China. They all -- We all had accounts in America, in New York, in the\nStates Bank, or National City Bank, whatever branches they had in China. And in those\ndays, if you changed the dollars at the official rate of Israeli exchange, you had to pay --\nwhen we came, two dollars and 80 cents for one Israeli pound. Because Israeli pound at that\ntime, was equivalent to the British pound. Two dollars and 80 cents. Within six months, it\nbecame a dollar for a dollar for a pound. In other words, if I change a thousand dollars, I\nused to get -- at 280, let\u2019s say, three -- 300 pounds, but then, if two months or three months\nlater, if I change a thousand dollars, I get a thousand pounds, which 1s a big difference. It\nwas a very, very difficult situation.",
        "Q: And so how did you -- How was it considered Black Market, what you were --",
        "A: Th-This 1s what we call Black Market. I mean, you had some people who had a lot of\nlocal money, cha -- Israeli money and they wanted to transfer them into American money,\nbut they couldn\u2019t do it officially, to go to the bank and buy dollars, it wasn\u2019t allowed.\nToday, you can. So, there was -- and we needed -- I needed pounds to -- to -- to -- to --\nIsraeli pounds to live on. So, if I would go and change a hundred dollars and get Israeli\npounds, I would give my check on -- on -- on -- on the -- on the bank, wherever I had my\naccount and he would give me the Israeli pounds, that was it.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: I -- I -- I -- You want me to look through this?",
        "Q: Yes, the -- the presidencies in particular, the different presidents --",
        "A: The presidents? The presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, fo -- ooh. Yes,\nwhat is the question?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about Truman.",
        "A: Truman? Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. We knew that Truman recognized, one of\nthe first ones. He was the second one. The first recognition was given to Israel by the\nRussians. Then Truman recognized the state of Israel and promised to help. I mean, the\npresident of -- the first president of -- of Israel, Dr. Weissman, came here and do you know -\n- did you ever see the picture he brought in the Torah, as a picture? Did you see that? No? It\nwas an interesting picture, I mean we appreciated that. Truman accepted it with thanks and\ncongratulated him. And you know what Weissman told him? He says President Truman --\nthat President Truman told him, \u201cCongratulation Mr. President.\u201d So President Weissman\nsays to him, \u201cYou see, there is a big difference Mr. President Truman.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the\ndifference?\u201d He says, \u201cYou are a president of 200 and what -- how many million\nAmericans? 60 -- hundred million Americans. I am the president of a -- a million\npresidents.\u201d Everybody in Israel thinks he\u2019s a president. That was Truman\u2019s story.",
        "Q: So Truman, you feel was -- was very supportive of the Jewish people?",
        "A: Y-Y-You know that -- whether it was support the Jewish people, whether it was oil\ninterest, we don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Whether it\u2019s against Russia, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to say. American politics, sometimes\nth-they -- they come connected -- interconnected to something else. I\u2019m trying to learn all\nthis now, especially with -- through the Clinton story, to understand what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s --\nIt\u2019s politics, it\u2019s oil, it\u2019s business. American business is business.",
        "Q: And before we leave, I also wanted you to tell me about the documentary that you\u2019re\ngoing to be a part of.",
        "A: Well, the Israeli -- a group of Israeli, I think they\u2019re very religious people -- seems most\nof the refugees that brough -- were brought from Japan, about 3,000 Jews, of them about a\nthousand were rabbis and -- and -- and -- and Yeshiva -- you know what Yeshiva 1s? Ha --\nYou know, rabbinical schools -- were over a thousand of them.",
        "Q: In Japan?",
        "A: Yeah, among those 3,000 Jews that we saved. And I was involved very much with --\nwith their problems, they had so many different problems, so many unworthy, I mean to\ndiscuss it, but they had to be solved. I don\u2019t know if I ever told the story about Passover, no?\nHuh? You heard -- You heard this story. Til today I remember it, so --",
        "Q: It\u2019s a wonderful story.",
        "A: They are making now, the Israeli company, religious Jews are making a documentary\nabout this.",
        "Q: Who is?",
        "A: Some group of people who are owning -- owning a documentary film. And they -- they\nsend a group of people to Japan and to China, and before they went there, they talked to me\nabout it, because they knew that I was involved in the Jewish community. And they\u2019re\ngoing to make a documentary and I told them a few stories about this Passover and about\nthis thing. And, I don\u2019t know if I ever told -- if I ever told this before, but anyway, a few\nyears ago, the Sony -- do you got a Sony here? No.",
        "Q: This?",
        "A: The other -- The other NHK, the Japanese film company called me up from Japan, was\nabout five years ago. And they said that they were making a documentary on Mr. Sukihara,\nin Japan and they want to come to talk to me, would I talk to him? I say, \u201cYes,\u201d Pll be glad\nto talk to him. And they came with a young lady from Brooklyn, who spoke perfect\nJapanese, was very interesting girl. And I told them I speak Japanese, but I would rather --\n\u201cYou might ask me some question,\u201d I said, \u201cwhich I will not be able to explain myself so\nwell, because my language 1s a little narrow.\u201d So they ask me a lot of questions, this, that\nand the other. Finally, \u201cWhy do you think Mr. Sukihara did what he did, gave visas?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYou know something, I\u2019m not a -- I\u2019m a Jew, but I\u2019m not a very Orthodox, very deeply\nreligious Jews. At -- \u201cFirst of all,\u201d I said, \u201cI want you to get it off the camera, I don\u2019t want to\ntell you to be on the camera, what I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know\nwhy he did it? He did it because God directed him to do it.\u201d \u201cWh-Wh-What do you mean?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYou see, he saved over a thousand rabbis and -- and rabbinical students and by\ndoing that, the -- the Jewish story, the -- the -- the teaching of Torah, Jewish religion, Jewish\nOrthodox religion, has not been lost. It\u2019s beings taught all over the world because of these\npeople that remained alive. That\u2019s why God did it.\u201d \u201cAh, so.\u201d Then they asked me a few\nquestion, \u201cWhat\u2019s a Torah?\u201d They didn\u2019t know. So I have a five books of Moses in English,\nI gave it to them for a few days, they read it. Came back, asked me some questions. And I\nstill believe that\u2019s what happened. H-His -- Just recently I had a meeting with his son and a\nlady. They -- They wrote a book, it\u2019s called, \u201cVisas for Life,\u201d did you hear about that visa?",
        "Q: Called what?",
        "A: They\u2019re going to make a be -- a documentary about Sukihara. There\u2019s a book that was\nwritten by Sukihara\u2019s son and another lady, I forgot her name, Japanese lady, which is\ncalled, \u201cVisas for Life.\u201d Very interesting book. And they invited me a couple of times\nthrough some of the exhibitions they made in temples and other places, I would go. They\nwould introduce me and this and that, because I met their father when he was 11. Oh, the\nquestions they asked me, I was -- I was -- inside of me, I was laughing. You know, th-they -\n- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re making money, they\u2019re making a living out of him, God bl -- help them,\nI mean, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s none of my business. \u201cDo you think,\u201d he asked me, Sukihara, \u201cmy\nfather was pro-American or pro-German?\u201d You know, Sukihara was a spy and there 1s no ca\n-- there is no -- there is no secret about it. He -- Well, you read this book, get this book. It\u2019s\ncalled, \u201cIn Search of Sukihara.\u201d\u2019",
        "Q: What did your -- What did you answer [indecipherable] to his son?",
        "A: I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he was pro-German and I don\u2019t think he was pro-American.\u201d \u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cHe was pro-Japanese. He was doing what the j1 -- he want -- he\nthought a good Japanese should do?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIf your father was alive today, and I would\nask him this question and he would give me an answer, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, I still wouldn\u2019t\nhave believed him. There\u2019s so many thing that are behind it, I cannot figure it out.\u201d Why?\nThe Japanese people who were so -- in those days, who were so departmental. Orders are\norders, you know. There was no such a thing as argue against your bosses. His was the\nforeign minister, what\u2019s his name there -- forgot his name, the one who signed the -- the\ntreaty with -- with Hitler. Japanese foreign minister, anyway, his boss.",
        "Q: Sukihara\u2019s boss?",
        "A: Sukihara\u2019s boss told him not to issue any visas. I mean, they off -- the -- the -- the -- the\ntelegram came -- I\u2019d like to -- how long you going to be here?",
        "Q: Til Monday.",
        "A: I'd like you to read this book, I\u2019m [indecipherable] lend it to you. Can I deliver it\nsomewhere? I think where [interruption] -- that\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: Id just like to know before we finish, if there anything else about those years of your\nexperience that you\u2019d like to say?",
        "A: I like to say this, that my -- my participation, whatever I did, was minuscule, 1t wasn\u2019t\nvery -- that very important. I-I-I-It played a certain part, but not in a very large scale. I say to\nthis, I was in the right place at the right time and I did to my opinion, was the right thing\nwhat I did. I didn\u2019t know at that time that the Holocaust was coming. You know, \u201840 - \u201c41,\nwe -- we didn\u2019t know there was a Holocaust. We knew there was anti-Jewish situation in\nGermany, but you didn\u2019t know that there would be such a terrible thing like a Holocaust, six\nmillion Jews killed in such a systematic way. It was un -- it [indecipherable] found out this\nafter the war, it was mindboggling. So if I did something to help to save these few thousand\nJews, thank God for that. That\u2019s all I can say. The right place, the right time.",

        "A: I have -- People, some of the people know me by four different first names. Why? How\ndid it happen? When I was born, I was born in Lithuania, in a city called Vilnus. My parents\nwere Orthodox Jews. They named me in Yiddish, which was -- the name was in my birth\ncertificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish, began with the name Labe. Labe in Yiddish\nmeans lion. It\u2019s a typical, Jewish sounding name. So, when we came to China, I was three\nyears old and I -- when I was about five, I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian\nlanguage and all the other subjects. I -- I didn\u2019t want to say that my name was Labe, because\nit sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and other things, I didn\u2019t want to be outstanding.\nSo when they asked me what my name is, I said, \u201cMy name is Lowah or Leve, which in\nRussian means lion. That\u2019s how I went through the Russian school. Then, when I was 17,\nmy -- my father told me, said -- advised me -- suggested that I go to studying in a British\nschool in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English language, which he said 1s important in order\nto get a job, in order to go ahead in life. So I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school.\nI didn\u2019t want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name, because it doesn\u2019t\nsound good. So I said my name, I became Leo, which means, in English, lion, same thing as\nthe other two names. And that\u2019s how I stayed, for many, many, many years, until, in 1948,\nbeginning of \u201849, we had to leave for Israel. When I came to Israel, I was drafted into the\narmy and when they asked me what my name was, I said, \u201cLeo.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, you\nhave to change your name, this is not a Hebrew name.\u201d He said, \u201cYou, from now on you\nwill be Arie,\u201d A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion. So, that\u2019s the same name and that\u2019s\nhow I stayed and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to change it any more.\u201d\u2019 When I came to America,\nArie, my social security is Arie, my driver\u2019s license is Arie, everything is Arie. Some people\nsuggested, \u201cGo on, change it, become Leo.\u201d I said, \u201cNo. Enough of that.\u201d I had some\nproblems by the way, when I was working on my visa to come to the United States, I was in\nTokyo -- I will tell you about it later. So, the -- the lady who was asking me questions, her\nname was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the American embassy, said, \u201c\u201cWhat is this, how can one\nman has to have four names?\u201d I explained to her, she says, ah, they don\u2019t -- she didn\u2019t -- I\nsaid, \u201cI tell you what. Ill bring you a letter from the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say\nthat these four names mean the same thing in different languages.\u201d That was acceptable.\nAnd that\u2019s it.

She was a pretty young girl, about 14 or so, I was 17 or 18 and during the\nhigh holidays -- in Shanghai at that time, there was no synagogue -- during the high\nholidays, the Jewish community, our older people, got together and rented an apartment\nwhere they conducted the prayers for the Jewish high holidays, New Year and the Day of\nAtonement. And I -- I used to attend those services. At that time I was already working in an\nimporting firm in -- they -- they gave me a job. I clerk in the office to learn the business.\nThey were importing from England, from Germany, from Poland, textiles. Woolen textiles,\nthere was a big market in China for textiles. And from England they imported some\nartificial silk, printed with beautiful red flowers. And it -- 1t was nice red flowers and I\nremember it. And then when I went to these services one day, I saw a -- a young, pretty girl\nin a dress with a red -- that material that we imported. That was such a surprise. And I\nlooked at material and I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s our material.\u201d Then I looked at her. I said to a friend\nof mine, I says, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the girl I like to meet.

        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t married yet.",
        "A: No, wait a minute, 1936 they send me, I was married next year. \u201836 -- beginning of 1936,\nI went to Japan. I got married later in 1936, came back to Shanghai, married and took my\nwife to -- with me to Japan. The reason why the-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it\nwas a different Japan in those days, they started copying the British and the French textiles.\nThey used to get samples from overseas and copy them in the Japanese factories and prices\nwere much cheaper, so they said, \u201cWe want to import from Japan. Go to Japan, open an\noffice.\u201d I was only what wa -- what was it, \u201836? 19 - 13 - 23 years old. I opened an office, I\ndecided I have to learn Japanese because I\u2019m dealing with the Japanese. I used to get\nsamples, which I would bring to different manufacturers and they would copy it. Then I\nwould export this merchandise to China. And then that was -- that was that period, that was\n\u201836, then my -- my -- we corresponded with my girlfriend -- my -- my Rebecca and then she\nsaid, \u201cWell, it\u2019s about time we got married.\u2019 Whatever. So I came back to Shanghai, got\nmarried, took her with me to Japan in 1936 and continued with my job. In 1937, after nine\nmonths of marriage, my son was born. Now, my wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was\nvery concerned to give birth in Japan, she didn\u2019t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she\nwas used to her mama, you know. And mama was in Shanghai. So she told me, \u201cI\u2019m going\nto go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the way you feel,\u201d I\nwa -- she was afraid, I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I send her to Japan and there our es -- our son is --\nearly in 1937, March 29th, was born. She was in Shanghai, I was in Japan. And that\u2019s --\nAnd that comes another very interesting cycle in my life.

        "A: Well, we\u2019ll come back to this. I used to go to a small restaurant to eat over there, in\nKovay, in Japan, 1937.

They were organized better than we there, because we were -- very\nfew of us. Anyway, so, as I told you, I was in that -- in that restaurant and I saw three new\nfaces. I sat not far from them and as I was listening to their conversation, they were talking\namong themselves Yiddish, which was a very rare thing. I got very surprised, and very\nexcited, I came up to them. I speak Yiddish, I talk to them and, \u201cWhat do you doing here,\nwhat are you doing here?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, we came here to open an office. We are from\nPanama. We have an office in Panama.\u201d They\u2019re exrom -- originally from Romania.\nThey\u2019re now in Panama and interesting again. You know the name Curacao of course, the\nvisas that [indecipherable]. They had an office in Curacao, they had an office in Panama.\nAnd they were going to open an office because they were starting to buy a lot of\nmerchandise. Business was really good over there. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to open an office,\nwhat -- do you speak Japanese?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHow are you\ngoing to operate an office?\u201d \u201cWe speak Spanish, and of course, Yiddish.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, I\ncan speak Japanese, I can speak English. I will help you to open an office, to hire people.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d We\u2019ll -- Became good friends. I was not -- not busy. We became very, very friendly\nand I helped them to establish an office. Of course, I didn\u2019t want -- they offered me some\nmoney, I -- I refused. And we became very close friends. Three months later -- I think 1t was\nthree months later, yeah, May, my wife sends me this -- a telegram, \u201cI\u2019m coming home with\nmy s -- with our son.\u201d That\u2019s fine. So I came to the boys, I said, \u201cLook, no more going\naround the nighttime to the nightclubs and then doing things which we were doing, young\nfellows. My wife is coming home with my son. Goodbye, good luck.\u201d My wife came and I\ndidn\u2019t see them any more, from 1937 to 1939. In 1939, my firm transla -- transferred me\nback to Shanghai, with my son, my wife, went to Shanghai. He was three years old, went to\nShanghai and I was working there, in the office in Shanghai and one day I have a telephone\ncall. The guy speaks to me o-on the telephone, he speaks to me Yiddish. I said, \u201c\u201cWho are\nyou?\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me, we -- y-you -- we were in Japan, we went\ntogether. My name is Max.\u201d \u201cOh, how are you Max? What are you doing in Shanghai?\u201d\nYou know, in those days, this was not so simple. You couldn\u2019t fly by planes, 30 days by\nboat. It was -- It was a different wor-world. He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m here already three days and\nI -- I would like you and your wife to come. I\u2019m in the Park Hotel,\u201d which is one of the best\nhotels, \u201cI\u2019m here buying merchandise,\u201d which he was shipping to -- somebody shipping to -\n- to - -to Panama, to Curacao, \u201cand I want to talk to you.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cCome with your wife.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cOkay.\u201d Came with my wife, I [indecipherable] long talk, talk, talk. He says to me,\n\u201cYou remember there were three of us when you met us in -- in Kovay?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the third guy who was with us, was my cousin. He was managing our office in Japan.\nHe was having a hard time, he didn\u2019t know any English, he didn\u2019t know any Japanese and\nhe decided to go out on his own, to make his own business. We need somebody to run our\noffice. Would you like to come and work with us in Japan?\u201d 1939. War in Europe just -- just\n-- just started. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not -- I have a good job here, I\u2019m not intention -- I have a small\nbaby.\u201d So he smiled. Max was his name. He was about 20 years older than I was, a more\nseasoned guy.",
        "A: Max -- Max Becker.",
        "A: He puts his hand in his pocket, like this, I remember, in his pocket inside his jacket. He\ntakes out a paper. It was an agreement, made by a lawyer, with me. He knew so well that\nI\u2019m not going to refuse his offer. When I opened the agreement, I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nIt was about five times as much money as I was making. It was tremendous offer, I got\nexcited. Besides, all may -- sou -- may -- my expe-expenses in Japan, paid by the office. A\ncar and a driver and a cook and the apartment, everything, beautiful. I said, \u201cShake.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cOne condition. I'll shake hands with you, cause you see, this a contract between me\nand you.\u201d I say, \u201cYes, what is the condition?\u201d \u201cCan you write Yiddish? All our\ncorrespondence has to be in Yiddish, because we don\u2019t know English, we don\u2019t know\nRussian, we don\u2019t know Japanese, you don\u2019t know Spanish. So there is only one way we\ncan correspond, Yiddish.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I know how to translate.\u201d \u201cYou got a job.\u201d And\nthree months later, I left my other job, I took my wife, my son, Kobe. Kobe --",
        "A: That was in 1939. That\u2019s the time -- you questioned about the Jewish community, we got\norganized in 1940 or so. Iam working for Max, he\u2019s teaching me buying, really tremendous\namount of merchandise. Had about 20 Japanese, an office and -- was a beautiful job, easy,\nbut responsible situation. The name of the firm was Curacao - Panama Trading Company,\nbecause there was -- we were shipping goods to Panama, to Curacao, to Peru, to Chile.\nSouth American countries with [indecipherable] everywhere. You know, it was a different\nJapan in those days, it was not a -- the time of wa -- Japanese radios, television sets, cars,\netcetera. It was toys and textiles and shoes and -- and underwear and -- and -- and blankets\nand tablecloths. All those things we were shipping there. And he says, \u201cI'll stay with you\ntwo months, Ill teach you.\u201d Of course, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know that merchandise, the\npricing and everything. He stayed with me and that was the time, beginning of 1940, when\nthe refugees -- the story of the refugees you know, they were coming with the Japanese\ntransit visas, started to come in. So, my good friend -- later, I was working for him in Japan,\nMr. Ponvy, he was there.",
        "A: Yes -- na -- at that time, no. I worked for Ponvy after the war. In \u201851, I came to -- back to\nTokyo, that\u2019s another story. He was a very fine man, a leader, an organizer. And one day he\ncame to me on a Sunday. H-H-He needed a secretary in a Jewish community to -- of course,\nhe didn\u2019t know any English correspondence where we thought our organization, he says\nwe're going to get organized.",
        "A: He was born in Russia. His name was Ponivairski. In 1941, beginning before the war, he\nemigrated to the United States and he changed his name from Ponivairski to Ponvi. Mr.\nPonvi -- Anatole was his first name -- was a wonderful man. A real leader, a real organizer\nand I was his secretary. I mean, not paid of course, just in the community. He says, \u201cWe\nhave to organize the Jewish community.\u201d There were about 20 our people, Russian speaking\nJews. We made a meeting, we got together, we organized. [indecipherable] organize, the\nfirst thing to do, you have to rent a place -- a place of worship. That\u2019s the first thing you do,\nand have an office. We\u2019ve got to organize. Ponvi, he organized every -- he was a wonderful\nman. I think one day, on a Sunday, I remember, he was -- he came to my house with a\ntelegram in his hand in English. This was the first telegram signed by six names from\nLithuania -- from Kalmus, Lithuania. German sounding names. \u201cWe German Jews in\nKalmus, Lithuania need Japanese transit visas. We are on our way to Argentina. The consul\nhere told us --\u201d the consul was this man, Sukihara, \u201ctold us that we can -- he -- he can give\nus transit visas if Jewish community in Kobe will guarantee our stay here. Financial support,\npolitical standing, etcetera, etcetera.\u201d That was in 1940, be -- be -- middle \u201840. So, I went\nwith him into the police station. The -- We -- They were taking care of all our affairs. And\nwe told them, here is a telegram, we -- they said, \u201cWill you guarantee?\u201d \u201cYes, we guarantee,\nwe --\u201d We had a stamp. We -- Already we\u2019re organized, had a stamp. We guarantee. These\npeople came. After about two weeks or so, they came with Japanese transit visas, but they\nhad visas -- final visas to go to Argentina. I never met these people.",
        "A: Yes, this -- these were the first visas Sukihara signed. Then, the Polish situation started\nwhen Poland, in 1939 was invaded by Russia from one side and by Germany from the other\nside. Many Jews from Poland, many from Warsaw, Krakow and other cities escaped. They\nwere afraid of the Germans, they were afraid of the Polish and where could they go?\nLithuania. At that time, up north in Lithuania, Lithuania was an independent country. And\nwhere you find Jewish community there who could -- who -- they knew that they would\ntake care of them. And they started smuggling themselves over from oc -- places occupied\nby the Polish one side or by the German on the other side. And they went -- That was before\nGermany attacked Poland -- Russia. They -- It escaped to Lithuania. And then they started\nthis Curacao visa story. You know the Curacao visas, on the strength of which, the Japanese\nconsul Sukihara was giving them transit visas, which we started getting telegrams, 10\npeople, 20 people, 100 people. Eventually we brought, with those visas, over 3,000 people.",
        "A: Well, my wife was -- we -- w-we -- when the Jewish committee was organized, of\ncourse, I was busy. After office, I used to go there and there were telegrams, letters, we had\nto -- I was the only one who could speak and write in English. There was correspondence,\nwith Jewish organizations all over, and people started to come from Poland. And they knew\n-- especially the religious people -- there were about a thousand religious people, rabbis and\nstudents, rabbinical students, organized in different groups. They would come for all their\nproblems. They would come to me, because I was the only one who could understand them.\nYoung as I was, they would come to me and I\u2019Il tell you some other stories which are very, I\nwouldn\u2019t say comical, but interesting, because they had their own problems, in spite of the\nfact they were refugees. Well, then our women, our wives, including my own Rebecca, got\norganized and they started to help the refugees, they had children. Children used to get sick,\nyou had to take them to the hospitals, they spoke Japanese. So, they were helping them.\nAlso, they started collecting clothes. Some people came naked, nothing on them. They\nstarted to collect clothes and give it to them and this was -- in -- in the evening. Then, when\nwe got organized, under Mr. Ponvi\u2019s guidance and instructions, we got together and we\nrented a home, which we came -- on the ground floor was a synagogue, on top was offices\nand a kitchen. We hired some people, our women taught the Japanese chefs how to make\ngood food, etcetera. And we were going there almost every day, especially the women, to\nplay Mah Jong and to play cards and that was a social --",

And I used to talk to Max and -- when he was t-\nteaching me how to -- mainly to buy the goods and the qualities and you know,\n[indecipherable] a lot of merchandise. And he says, \u201cI\u2019m going, you are ready. I ca -- You\ncan take it over.\u201d Then one day I said to him, \u201cMax, wh-where is your family, where is your\nfamily?

I don\u2019t know any languages.\u201d Shows me letters, he corresponds with his father, in\nYiddish, of course. \u201cWhere shall I go?

They\u2019re Jews.\u201d He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m asking\nthem to leave, they said they can\u2019t go.\u201d I said, \u201cTell them to come here to Japan, same way\nthe other refugees are coming. I will take care of them and we\u2019ll work something out, but\nget them out.\u201d He says, \u201cLook, I --\u201d and he shows me letters he writes to them, was about\nsix weeks before he left. He says to his father, \u201cI still insist and I want you to leave with\nMama and the two sisters, 15 - 16, and come here to Japan.\u201d Well, so he -- His father writes\nto him, \u201cYou -- I think you ha -- must have gone out of your mind. I should go to Japan, an\nOrthodox Jew like me? What am I going to do there?\u201d You know. I said, \u201cMax, tell him, if\nhe decides to leave, let me know. I don\u2019t know how, what we -- I will do, but I will -- we\u2019re\nbringing thousands of Polish Jews, we\u2019ll bring them out somehow. And then wa -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t want to worry about what\u2019s going to happen then.

During -- 1941, December the eighth, Pearl Harbor, I was in\nKobe with my wife and my son. I was working for the Panamanian firm, I remember I told\nyou. When Panama declared war on Japan, the military came to my office, it was a\nPanamanian, enemy firm. I was not -- I was a stateless immigrant without any documents,\nwithout any citizenship. I had my permit to come to Japan because I was working there.\nEvery six months I had to renew it and it was no problem. My son, who was born in China,\nbut also stateless. My wife was stateless person. Anyway, in 1942, when Panama declared\nwar on Japan, the firm became enemy firm. The military came and they put stamps on the\nsafe, whatever merchandise I had there, whatever money, everything was arrested and I was\nleft with-without my payment, without money, without anything, because, you know, it was\n-- it was running. And they said, \u201cLook, you are not an enemy subject, but the firm you are\nworking for is enemy, so we have to -- to take these steps.\u201d They put seals on the safe and\nwhatever. And they said, \u201cYou can do what you want.\u201d And that was in December of 1942.\nIn February, things were getting very difficult. Food was hard to get. Everybody was\nrationed, not only foreigners, Japanese also. And I remember so well there were rumors, fish\nis going to be distributed. So I remember so -- twice, I got up at four in the morning, run to\nget in line for the fish. By the time my turn came at seven o\u2019clock, no more fish. It was a\nhard time. My wife, my child, who was -- Israel was at that time, \u201837, three years old -- four\nyears old. So, I had family at that time in Shanghai, my father and my mother. My wife\u2019s\nmother and her sister and other family members were in Shanghai, so they wrote us letters\ncoy -- thing was more or less normal, it was just the beginning of the war, before Japan was\nbombed and all that. And we decided we\u2019re going to go. I decided I have nothing -- I have\nto make a living somehow. I took my wife, my son, and we went to Shanghai.",
        "A: We lived -- My sister\u2019s -- My wife\u2019s sister had a -- lived in a very large ho -- house. And\nshe just -- There was for her -- her husband, who was -- he was a French guy. And she had\nrooms there and we -- she invited us to stay there, sharing all the expenses, whether it was\nrent and food and everything, and that\u2019s where we lived. And making a living was pretty --\nyou know, it wasn\u2019t -- jiha -- it\u2019s hard to explain, 1t was an open market, an open black\nmarket. You could get any merchandise from this guy -- this guy had this, you could sell it.\nAnd this is how we made a living, buying, selling, and it was going on all right. Organized\nlife was pretty good, the Jewish community was pretty good and strong. We had our club,\nwe had our synagogues, we had our libraries, hospitals. It was okay. And then my s -- my\ndaughter -- my daughter Miriam was born in 1943, during the war. My wife said, \u201cLet\u2019s\nhave another baby.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s hard, war-time.\u201d She wanted it. Okay, she was right. Of\ncourse, sh-she is the apple of my eye now. She is looking after me, my daughter. The\nwomen are always more attached to their fathers than th -- th-than the men are. My sons are\nalso good to me, I\u2019m very grateful. Anyway, Miriam was born, we call her Mimi for short,\nin 1943 and then the war was over. Then we were -- we just managed. There was no clothes,\nthere was a little bit of a -- I don\u2019t know if you read about, or heard about it, the -- on the --\nJa-Japanese were allies with Germany. Under German influence, the Japanese military were\nprobing -- were thinking of, under German influence and pressure -- there were about\n20,000 Jews that escaped from Germany, Austria and Poland, came to Shanghai. They\ncould come there without any visas, they just would came -- be-before the war, including\nthe 3,000 Polish Jews that we saved, brought to Japan and then they came to Shanghai. And\nthey -- the Japanese, under the pressure from the Germans, decided to take all these stateless\nJewish Germ -- who came out in \u00b037, and they put them in the ghetto. You heard about this?\nIn Shanghai ghetto? They didn\u2019t take us, they only took those that came before -- after \u201837.\nThe reason for this, I still don\u2019t know if it -- 60 years went by and why did the Japanese\nhesitated to do to us what the Germans did? After all, the Germans were already getting\nready for the Holocaust you see, and --",
        "A: Who? Why did what?",
        "A: Who choose the date 1937? Oh, why the Japane -- because that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the date when -\n- when the Japanese and the Germans signed their military alliance, number one, and\nnumber two, many, many Germans, Jews and Austrians were allowed to come openly to\nShanghai. They came by boats and they came -- except those that came by Japan, that we\ntook care of, you see? And they put them into ghettos, from 1943.",
        "A: Shanghai.",
        "A: And that --",
        "A: I-In \u201845, when the war ended, we were in Shanghai, yes. And when the war was over, we\nwere, of course, happy and relieved because some American planes bombed Shanghai. Not\nwhere we lived, but where the German Jews lived, in the honque Japanese areas. But that\u2019s\nwhere they ja -- I thing American military thought, or whatever it was, I don\u2019t know the\nreasons that they had some factories that were making materials for the war effort. Anyway,\na few bombs fell in those areas and they killed a few hundred Jewish refugees, the American\nbombs. That was one of those war stories. And 1945, the war was over, the Americans came\nand I had in my mind all the time, China is a huge country. Now, there\u2019s no more Japanese\noccupation, it will open up and there\u2019Il be a lot of business to be done. So, I knew where my\n-- Max Becker and -- had an office in New York. I knew [indecipherable], and then five\nyears went by. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to write him a letter,\u201d telling him possibilities of\ndoing business in Shanghai, and I suggest that we send this and this and this kind of\nmerchandise.",
        "A: I was only for myself [inaudible] with my father and my father was in the -- 1n the -- in\ntextile retail business, he was selling people suitlinks for wearing -- woolen textiles. So, the\nfirst American plane I remember, with American pilots came, about 30 of them. I don\u2019t\nremember -- they had a special name. They landed in Shanghai. We were so excited,\nAmericans are here. And the Japanese were surrendering. We would rather they surrender to\nthe Americans than to the Chinese, because we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be with the\nChinese. Communists were fighting Hatsunists, you know. Was a ver -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nanother world. I wrote a letter to them 1-1n New York and I couldn\u2019t mail it because there\nwas no communication. So I mi -- took my bicycle -- in those days, w-we all had bicycles\nbecause cars were not -- expensive and not available. I pedaled to the hotel where I knew\nthe American flyers were and I came in there. There was a big sergeant,, I remember so\nwell. \u201cHello, Sergeant.\u201d \u201cYes, sir. What can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cLook, here is a letter. I\nhave to mail it to New York. I can read it to you what I write there, because it\u2019s in a foreign\nlanguage,\u201d it was in Jewish. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t care, the war is over.\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t mail it\nbecause there is no -- no mail yet, no communication.\u201d He says, \u201cWe are leaving tomorrow\nfor Honolulu. Pll mail it for you.\u201d I said, \u201cSir, thank you, how much this is?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want\nany money.\u201d Anyway, he took the letter, I was very grateful and then about three, four\nweeks, I get a telegram from New York. Already communication started to -- excuse me --\nand he says, \u201c[indecipherable] we received your letter and don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re old friends\nand we\u2019ll send you the merchandise and you'll be all right. We\u2019ll send you and I will give\nyou credit,\u201d and etcetera, etcetera. Anyway, to make a long story short, from 1946 to 1948,\nMax send me a lot of merchandise, open account. And business was fantastic. Was making\na lot of money. Then one day, he came to check out. Of course he was sending me a lot of\nmerchandise, I owed them a lot of money. Of course, I paid everything, everything was all\nright, under control, I had papers. Well, he wanted to see what\u2019s going on and I don\u2019t blame\nhim, it was his money. He came, I met him and I don\u2019t know if I said so -- if I said that in\nthe old tape, about his parents, what happened to them, did I say that? You recall?",
        "A: They were killed by the Nazis.",
        "A: He -- He knew about it, he came, and that\u2019s another story. Anyway, business was good\nand he says -- we continued it with the business and he went back to Panama and I stayed in\nShanghai and everything was going fine until the rumors.

And\nsomehow, they wanted to pay me back, I think. One guy asked me to work for him and they\ndidn\u2019t offer me any money, of course. If they did, I wouldn\u2019t have taken it. And one was -- I\nwas working for him, he couldn\u2019t speak a word of English, but he was a very bright man.\nAnd he says to me one day, \u201cThings are getting worse and worse, you know, the ja -- the --\nwe hear the Communists are advancing.

        "A: They stayed at home and my oldest son was in school and my other kids were still too\nyoung, one was very young. Anyway, we were making in disin -- decent living, wa -- kind\nof a hard.",
        "A: I wa -- I had two jobs. I was working in the customs and in the evening I would go to the\npost office, checking the packages and I -- I -- I calculated the duty, because a lot of\npackages were coming from all over the world. And I\u2019m working in the customs and one\nday, this -- I got the letter from the bank that I discounted six promissory notes.",
        "A: I discounted the promissory notes I got from my partner. I -- I gave them to the bank and\nthey gave me the money against -- against interest, you know? Against me -- Against the\npromissory notes. And he was supposed to pay for these, because they were -- they were\nbroken down to one per month. So I got a telephone call from the bank that the first one,\nwhich was due on February the first, or whatever it was, it was paid. The other ones not\npaid. I see and say, \u201cI finished with the guy, he stole all my money.\u201d So, I\u2019m sitting and\nworking in my office and he comes in, my partner, who I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t see him for all this\ntime. He comes in with a guard, a guard brings him in because in customs, you had to have\na permit to go and see [indecipherable]. He comes in and he says to me, he says, \u201cI paid for\nthe first bill, but I\u2019m not going to pay any more.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t pay\nany more? We made a deal, we finished with it -- a lawyer.\u201d He says, \u201cIf you say one more\nword, I\u2019ll go to your boss and you\u2019re working for the government now, and I will tell him\nthat you changed money on the black market and I'll put you in jail.\u201d I got so mad, I was -- I\n-- I told to the guard, \u201cTake him out of here. I don\u2019t want to see him any more.\u201d And I don\u2019t\nknow what am I going to do. In the meantime, already, I am working on a permit, exit\npermit, because my friend Mr. Ponvi is in Japan in 1951. He heard that I\u2019m having problems\nin Israel. He send me a letter, he says, \u201cIf you want to come and work with me in Tokyo, [Il\nhave you any time. I'll send you a visa.\u201d But I had to get an exit permit -- \u201851, my friend,\nMr. Ponvi, who has established a store in Tokyo, he came back from America in 1949, to\nJapan, to Tokyo, as an American citizen already. He opened a big store on the main street in\nTokyo, Ginza. Only a few foreign firms, American, British, French, were allowed to import\ngoods in those days. Japanese were not allowed yet. It was before the peace treaty was\nsigned in 1955, I believe. MacArthur. And so he -- he needed someone to help him there\nand he -- he s -- he send me a telegram. He says, if you want to come and work for me in\nTokyo, you\u2019re welcome, I\u2019Il send you a visa. Which he did and I -- in *51 -- at the same\ntime, my youngest son, Danny was a very sick child. He had asthma. He was two years old -\n- no, he was three years old already. And he was a very, very sick boy and I show him to\nthe doctors and the doctors said, \u201cThe climate in Israel, the sand, the heat, is very bad for\nhim. If you don\u2019t take him away to Switzerland or somewhere to breathe fresh air, he\u2019s\ngoing to die here.\u201d Well my -- my wife, myself, we were very, very upset. And it so\nhappened my wife had a sister who was married to a Swiss guy and they lived in\nSwitzerland. So I send a telegram, I said, \u201cLook, my wife has to come to Switzerland for\nabout six months while I go to Japan.\u201d And they came back and they said come on down\nand my wife and my daughter -- she took my daughter and Danny, the little guy, to\nSwitzerland. She also wanted to take my -- our oldest son, who was at that time \u201837, \u201847, 16\n-- fif -- 16 years old, but they wouldn\u2019t let him leave, because in a years time he had to go to\nthe army. That was a rule in Israel. So she left to Switzerland with the two children. I went\nto Japan to work for Mr. Ponvi and Israel stayed behind with my wife\u2019s mother, she looked\nafter him until he had to go to the army, which he did. He was in the 56 year war. He\nbecame an officer in the Israeli army. I came to Japan and there, working for Mr. Ponvi\u2019s\nstore, was Mr. s -- [indecipherable] was Mr. Sukihara. Mr. --",
        "A: Yes, a very large department store. Only foreigners who could pay in dollars were\nallowed to buy, the Japanese are not allowed, because that was before the peace treaty was\nsigned.",

        "A: Almost. [indecipherable] boss together. They were importing textiles again and I\u2019m a\ntextile man. And I was w-watching wh-which goods to buy and helping with the Japanese\nstopit, talking to the American [indecipherable] because most of the customers were GI\u2019s --\nthat was during the Korean war -- who would come on R and R from Korea to Tokyo and\nbefore they go to -- report to go home, they would huf -- we also had jewelry department\nand silks and textiles. And they would come and buy jewelers and textiles and pay in\ndollars. That was the only way that they were al -- they call is script in those days, do you\nknow what a script is? There were no dollars in those days, the army used to pay them in\nspecial papers.",

        "A: On Ginza, on the main street in Tokyo, very beautiful store. And we worked there and I\nmet Sukihara over there. And I -- I -- I -- he spoke perfect, perfect Russian and perfect\nGerman and perfect English. And [indecipherable] face, a very interesting man. And I tried,\nI tr -- He was in charge of all Japanese employees, there were about 25 of them. Taxes and\nyou know, relations and all that. Yeah, that\u2019s Sukiharason. Yeah, that\u2019s him. A few times I\ncame up to him and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have lunch and I want you to talk to me about what\nyou did. I understand you did --\u201d He wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I pushed and I pressed, I was\ninterested. I was, \u201cWell why, why did he do it?\u201d Til today I don\u2019t know why he did it. I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Why he was giving those visas after he was instructed by the foreign office to stop\ngiving the visas. I don\u2019t know if you read the book, it\u2019s called, \u201cIn Search of Sukihara.\u201d Try\nand get it, it\u2019s a very interesting story. Dr. Hela Levine made a complete research. He went\nto Japan and he spoke to his children and he spoke to his widow and -- very interesting\nstory. And only one day, he finally, after I was pushing him -- he was really aloof. He was\nnever friendly with his own Japanese people. This a -- you know, the man was a diplomat.\nThe man spoke so many languages. The man -- I think what was in his mind -- he lost his\njob.",
        "A: For what he did. Why did he do it? I wanted to find out. He told me once, I will never\nforget this, he says, \u201cIt was the finger of God.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, I saved\nthose people because I had an inspiration I must save them.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I\nsays -- \u201cI -- I -- I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d He never, never, never talked to me about.

And that\nwas about three years they were asking me questions. It was during McCarthy times.",
        "A: A lady in charge, Miss Pinard was his name. She was in charge of the visa section.",

Where else would I go to give my children an education?",
        "A: No, no, no. My wife was in Switzerland with the two younger children and then, after six\nmonths or so, I brought them to Japan, to stay with me. I was working in Ponvi, she came\nwith the children. We had a very easy life, very good life, very comfortable life.

And we started a\nwonderful relationship which eventually wound up that I came back from Japan to America,\nto get my citizenship, which I got and they offered me a job to work with them, these two\nfriends of mine here, Allen and Abe, which eventually developed to become a very large\ncompany, Lloyd\u2019s Electronics. I was one of the directors. For 25 years I worked for them.\nMy main job was developing -- I used to go to Japan, to Korea, to Taiwan, to Hong Kong,\ncause I knew how to deal with these people. And also, I used to go to South America to\ndevelop South American markets. Panama, South Africa, Venezuela, Chile and this was my\njob fo-for 25 years.",

        "A: [| -- | -- I didn\u2019t think it was right to put American citizens -- they were American\ncitizens, that\u2019s what bothered me, to be put into special camps, because they were not a\nJapanese, even though they were suspected of being spies and all whatever. But I felt\nlegally, they were not -- they had no right to do that to them.",
        "A: When? Which -- In which period of time? Well, they were --",
        "A: -- they were allies. The Japanese signed a -- a three [indecipherable] Japan, Italy and --\nand Germany, they signed that -- what they called an axis arrangement, it was in 19 -- when\nwas it, I think in 1938 - \u201839. That was a military alliance signed by Japan and Germany.",
        "A: At that time, my thought was that this -- all this political and military arrangements were\nagainst Russia. See Japan was always -- considered herself an enemy of Russian\ncommunism. It was no idea it would become a Pearl Harbor situation. No, no, not -- not --\nnever enter -- came into my mind. I -- I know they admired the Americans, they liked the\nAmericans. They -- They -- They -- They emulated them and all that, but whatever they\nwere doing political, I think it was all against Russia. That was my opinion.",
        "A: Yes, I saw him in -- in Venezuela many years later, when I was traveling on my business,\nI went to see him in Caracas, Venezuela. He was there, married, with children. I don\u2019t know\nif I told you about this story.",

And besides, it has to do\nalso with finances. I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t a rich man, but if I sell this condominium, I would\nhave some money to be able to make my own decisions what to do next. And I listened to\nthem and I\u2019m glad I did. We moved here, in Woodland Hills. I am living in a retirement\nhotel. Not an old age home, a retirement hotel.",
        "A: Has about over a hundred people. Not a very interesting life, but at least I\u2019m about five\nminutes away from my daughter and her husband and they\u2019re so good to me. My daughter\ncalls me every day. \u201cHello Dad, how are you?\u201d And the-they\u2019re good people, good people.",

        "A: Why do I think that\u2019s important?",
        "A: Let me read you something.",
        "A: It\u2019s on my 85th birthday in -- in a magazine printed in Tel Aviv, in Israel. \u201cLeo is a\ndevoted family man. Proud, justly so, of his children, grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren. Throughout his life, Leo had been a committed Jew, a leader in the Jewish\ncommunity, a devoted friend of Israel, a generous person, a faithful friend. In a way, always\nready to respond to the needs of others.\u201d I mean, 1-it\u2019s not a matter of -- I was not -- I told\nmy -- my Eddie, my grandson that married a Catholic girl, a very nice girl, Michelle. And I\ntold my children, if it\u2019s going to be a wedding in a -- in a -- in a church, if he\u2019s going to\nconvert, this grandpa is not coming. \u201cWhy? Eddie will be bra -- ba -- heartbroken.\u201d I said,\n\u201cLook, I cannot, just --\u201d So they arranged, they had an interdenominational wedding and she\nis a lovely girl and they live well together and that\u2019s it. This is America, I understand. I am\nnot that old-fashioned to -- to -- to -- to be so, how shall I say, crazily -- I understand. My\nmind is open.",
        "A: I -- You know, the first tape that I made in -- in the museum --",
        "A: I played it to the children and to the grandchildren. There is another tape, which was\nmade by the Wiesenthal Holocaust Museum, here. I played that also. And the children\nknow. Th-They read, especially the grandchildren I\u2019m talking about. They were brought up\nin -- in -- not in a very Orthodox Jewish way, but you know, th-they know -- th-they know. I\ndon\u2019t know if they\u2019re as -- as committed as I would have liked them to be, but this is\nAmerica.",
        "A: We -- We -- No, I say -- That\u2019s right, we have to be open minded, we have to understand\nthat America, and I\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m [indecipherable]. To me, America, there\u2019s\nno other place in the world like America. And I think I understand many things that are\nhappening here good and bad. I\u2019m not going to talk about what\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s\nhappening today, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- has nothing to do with my life. But I understand all that and\nsometimes it hurts. But sometimes I -- I have to say to myself, \u201cWell, this is America.\nThank God the Jewish people in America have a good life.\u201d There is some anti-Semitism\nhere, I know. Farrakhan 1s here and other things are happening, but no country in the world\nhas been so good, so open and so understanding, with all the other problems that America\nhas been and for this I am grateful.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, I think so. I think that -- of course, I didn\u2019t speak to many Holocaust survivors. I\ndidn\u2019t speak to them, but I read a lot about it, all these stories, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and all the\nother movies, etcetera, etcetera. And I think that many Jews, survivors of Holocaust had\nnowhere to go, only to Israel. No other country -- America accepted some, Australia\naccepted some, but mostly they came to Israel. And where -- where would they have gone if\nit wasn\u2019t for the -- for -- for Israel? That\u2019s the way I look at it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Japanese concentra -- Japanese -- Do we want me to go through all of them?",
        "A: Well, we spoke about Japanese concentration camps, right?",
        "A: The Cold War. The Cold War is -- was strictly war -- Cold War between American\ndemocracy and Communism, which had to be resolved, there was always the danger of -- of\n-- of war, only the na -- Russians were accumulating all these nuclears weapon -- nuclear\nweapons, with which they -- America was for them an enemy. That was -- That\u2019s the way I\nlooked at it. And when Soviet Russia became no more, | think -- I think it\u2019s a good thing\nthat happened.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no --",
        "A: The era of Joseph McCArthy and the Red scare. Well, the only thing I can -- I was never\ntold that it was because of Joseph McCarthy\u2019s s-situation that my visa was delayed for so\nlong, but it was part of life, an ex-Russian, speaking Russian, must be a Communist. You\nknow, it was -- I think it was implanted in the -- in the heads of the -- of the United States\nembassy employees, tha -- to -- to -- to cro -- to check it out, because Rosenberg\u2019s -- at that\ntime the spies, the Jewish spies that were co -- there were two who were executed. It was a -\n- it\u2019s a difficult situation, whether this should have been or not, I cannot make my opinion,\nbecause I am not -- first of all, I was not at that time an American citizen to really\nunderstand what was going on.",
        "A: When I was here?",
        "A: Well, in -- in -- in Los Angeles and where we lived here, we didn\u2019t see that much anti-\nBlack, what do you call it, attitudes. We saw it on television. We saw it -- what happening\nthe southern states and the marches that organized by Martin Luther King and th-the dogs\nthat were put on them and the people that couldn\u2019t work, people -- Black people couldn\u2019t\ndrink water and go to the bathroom and all that kind of thing. It -- It -- It -- It bothered me,\nbut I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know the Black people too well, to really understand what\u2019s -- what\u2019s\ngoing on. Cause I think the Blacks that are in the south are different than what they are here.\nThey\u2019re here, they are more integrated, don\u2019t you think so? It\u2019s -- It\u2019s a difficult problem.\nYou see, Id like to say to myself that after all my experiences and all my life, that I am an\nAmerican, but I am not, really. I co -- I couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t born here, I didn\u2019t grow up here,\nand I sometimes listen to my children, to my grandchildren, the way they talk. I see they are\nAmericans. I am still -- who am I? I don\u2019t know. Russian, Jewish, Japanese, Chinese, I don\u2019t\nknow. My head is mixed up.",
        "A: Five. I start with Russian, Yiddish, English, Hebrew, some Japanese and -- not fluent,\nsome Chinese, not fluent. And I picked up some German in school and when I was dealing\nwith the Polish refugees, I picked up some Polish.",
        "A: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where, where?",
        "A: Yes, in Israel.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: A -- A lot of people that came from abroad in those days, knew -- knew immigrants that\nhad dollars.",
        "A: Yes, American dollars, in -- in -- not in their pockets, cash, but in accounts. I\u2019m talking\nabout Jews from China. They all -- We all had accounts in America, in New York, in the\nStates Bank, or National City Bank, whatever branches they had in China. And in those\ndays, if you changed the dollars at the official rate of Israeli exchange, you had to pay --\nwhen we came, two dollars and 80 cents for one Israeli pound. Because Israeli pound at that\ntime, was equivalent to the British pound. Two dollars and 80 cents. Within six months, it\nbecame a dollar for a dollar for a pound. In other words, if I change a thousand dollars, I\nused to get -- at 280, let\u2019s say, three -- 300 pounds, but then, if two months or three months\nlater, if I change a thousand dollars, I get a thousand pounds, which 1s a big difference. It\nwas a very, very difficult situation.",
        "A: Th-This 1s what we call Black Market. I mean, you had some people who had a lot of\nlocal money, cha -- Israeli money and they wanted to transfer them into American money,\nbut they couldn\u2019t do it officially, to go to the bank and buy dollars, it wasn\u2019t allowed.\nToday, you can. So, there was -- and we needed -- I needed pounds to -- to -- to -- to --\nIsraeli pounds to live on. So, if I would go and change a hundred dollars and get Israeli\npounds, I would give my check on -- on -- on -- on the -- on the bank, wherever I had my\naccount and he would give me the Israeli pounds, that was it.",
        "A: I -- I -- I -- You want me to look through this?",
        "A: The presidents? The presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, fo -- ooh. Yes,\nwhat is the question?",
        "A: Truman? Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. We knew that Truman recognized, one of\nthe first ones. He was the second one. The first recognition was given to Israel by the\nRussians. Then Truman recognized the state of Israel and promised to help. I mean, the\npresident of -- the first president of -- of Israel, Dr. Weissman, came here and do you know -\n- did you ever see the picture he brought in the Torah, as a picture? Did you see that? No? It\nwas an interesting picture, I mean we appreciated that. Truman accepted it with thanks and\ncongratulated him. And you know what Weissman told him? He says President Truman --\nthat President Truman told him, \u201cCongratulation Mr. President.\u201d So President Weissman\nsays to him, \u201cYou see, there is a big difference Mr. President Truman.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the\ndifference?\u201d He says, \u201cYou are a president of 200 and what -- how many million\nAmericans? 60 -- hundred million Americans. I am the president of a -- a million\npresidents.\u201d Everybody in Israel thinks he\u2019s a president. That was Truman\u2019s story.",
        "A: Y-Y-You know that -- whether it was support the Jewish people, whether it was oil\ninterest, we don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Whether it\u2019s against Russia, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to say. American politics, sometimes\nth-they -- they come connected -- interconnected to something else. I\u2019m trying to learn all\nthis now, especially with -- through the Clinton story, to understand what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s --\nIt\u2019s politics, it\u2019s oil, it\u2019s business. American business is business.",
        "A: Well, the Israeli -- a group of Israeli, I think they\u2019re very religious people -- seems most\nof the refugees that brough -- were brought from Japan, about 3,000 Jews, of them about a\nthousand were rabbis and -- and -- and -- and Yeshiva -- you know what Yeshiva 1s? Ha --\nYou know, rabbinical schools -- were over a thousand of them.",
        "A: Yeah, among those 3,000 Jews that we saved. And I was involved very much with --\nwith their problems, they had so many different problems, so many unworthy, I mean to\ndiscuss it, but they had to be solved. I don\u2019t know if I ever told the story about Passover, no?\nHuh? You heard -- You heard this story. Til today I remember it, so --",
        "A: They are making now, the Israeli company, religious Jews are making a documentary\nabout this.",
        "A: Some group of people who are owning -- owning a documentary film. And they -- they\nsend a group of people to Japan and to China, and before they went there, they talked to me\nabout it, because they knew that I was involved in the Jewish community. And they\u2019re\ngoing to make a documentary and I told them a few stories about this Passover and about\nthis thing. And, I don\u2019t know if I ever told -- if I ever told this before, but anyway, a few\nyears ago, the Sony -- do you got a Sony here? No.",
        "A: The other -- The other NHK, the Japanese film company called me up from Japan, was\nabout five years ago. And they said that they were making a documentary on Mr. Sukihara,\nin Japan and they want to come to talk to me, would I talk to him? I say, \u201cYes,\u201d Pll be glad\nto talk to him. And they came with a young lady from Brooklyn, who spoke perfect\nJapanese, was very interesting girl. And I told them I speak Japanese, but I would rather --\n\u201cYou might ask me some question,\u201d I said, \u201cwhich I will not be able to explain myself so\nwell, because my language 1s a little narrow.\u201d So they ask me a lot of questions, this, that\nand the other. Finally, \u201cWhy do you think Mr. Sukihara did what he did, gave visas?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYou know something, I\u2019m not a -- I\u2019m a Jew, but I\u2019m not a very Orthodox, very deeply\nreligious Jews. At -- \u201cFirst of all,\u201d I said, \u201cI want you to get it off the camera, I don\u2019t want to\ntell you to be on the camera, what I\u2019m going to tell you.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know\nwhy he did it? He did it because God directed him to do it.\u201d \u201cWh-Wh-What do you mean?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYou see, he saved over a thousand rabbis and -- and rabbinical students and by\ndoing that, the -- the Jewish story, the -- the -- the teaching of Torah, Jewish religion, Jewish\nOrthodox religion, has not been lost. It\u2019s beings taught all over the world because of these\npeople that remained alive. That\u2019s why God did it.\u201d \u201cAh, so.\u201d Then they asked me a few\nquestion, \u201cWhat\u2019s a Torah?\u201d They didn\u2019t know. So I have a five books of Moses in English,\nI gave it to them for a few days, they read it. Came back, asked me some questions. And I\nstill believe that\u2019s what happened. H-His -- Just recently I had a meeting with his son and a\nlady. They -- They wrote a book, it\u2019s called, \u201cVisas for Life,\u201d did you hear about that visa?",
        "A: They\u2019re going to make a be -- a documentary about Sukihara. There\u2019s a book that was\nwritten by Sukihara\u2019s son and another lady, I forgot her name, Japanese lady, which is\ncalled, \u201cVisas for Life.\u201d Very interesting book. And they invited me a couple of times\nthrough some of the exhibitions they made in temples and other places, I would go. They\nwould introduce me and this and that, because I met their father when he was 11. Oh, the\nquestions they asked me, I was -- I was -- inside of me, I was laughing. You know, th-they -\n- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re making money, they\u2019re making a living out of him, God bl -- help them,\nI mean, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s none of my business. \u201cDo you think,\u201d he asked me, Sukihara, \u201cmy\nfather was pro-American or pro-German?\u201d You know, Sukihara was a spy and there 1s no ca\n-- there is no -- there is no secret about it. He -- Well, you read this book, get this book. It\u2019s\ncalled, \u201cIn Search of Sukihara.\u201d\u2019",
        "A: I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he was pro-German and I don\u2019t think he was pro-American.\u201d \u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d I said, \u201cHe was pro-Japanese. He was doing what the j1 -- he want -- he\nthought a good Japanese should do?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIf your father was alive today, and I would\nask him this question and he would give me an answer, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, I still wouldn\u2019t\nhave believed him. There\u2019s so many thing that are behind it, I cannot figure it out.\u201d Why?\nThe Japanese people who were so -- in those days, who were so departmental. Orders are\norders, you know. There was no such a thing as argue against your bosses. His was the\nforeign minister, what\u2019s his name there -- forgot his name, the one who signed the -- the\ntreaty with -- with Hitler. Japanese foreign minister, anyway, his boss.",
        "A: Sukihara\u2019s boss told him not to issue any visas. I mean, they off -- the -- the -- the -- the\ntelegram came -- I\u2019d like to -- how long you going to be here?",
        "A: I'd like you to read this book, I\u2019m [indecipherable] lend it to you. Can I deliver it\nsomewhere? I think where [interruption] -- that\u2019s all right.",
        "A: I like to say this, that my -- my participation, whatever I did, was minuscule, 1t wasn\u2019t\nvery -- that very important. I-I-I-It played a certain part, but not in a very large scale. I say to\nthis, I was in the right place at the right time and I did to my opinion, was the right thing\nwhat I did. I didn\u2019t know at that time that the Holocaust was coming. You know, \u201840 - \u201c41,\nwe -- we didn\u2019t know there was a Holocaust. We knew there was anti-Jewish situation in\nGermany, but you didn\u2019t know that there would be such a terrible thing like a Holocaust, six\nmillion Jews killed in such a systematic way. It was un -- it [indecipherable] found out this\nafter the war, it was mindboggling. So if I did something to help to save these few thousand\nJews, thank God for that. That\u2019s all I can say. The right place, the right time.",
