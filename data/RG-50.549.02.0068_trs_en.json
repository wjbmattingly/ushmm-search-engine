But I want to start, because this is a post-Holocaust interview, at the\nend of that experience when you were by yourself in the forest. You\u2019d been wandering\nfor a couple years, maybe?",

        "A: Well, yeah, they were pushing they -- at that time they were pushing the Germans\nback and as it happened -- I don\u2019t know, it was I guess, an entire battalion, I\u2019m not sure.\nBut Russian soldiers, Soviet Union soldiers were marching through the forest where I\nwas dying, actually. I -- usually when I was in the forest, I would dig a little grave and\ncover it, camouflage it as much as I could and stay there as long as hunger and cold\nwould allow me to stay in one place. At that point I was very ill, I must have eaten\nsomething that didn\u2019t agree with me. And I was in my own filth, surrounded by my own\nfilth, and I -- I think I was dying. I don\u2019t really recall one time, I think, that I wasn\u2019t\nactually aware of it, and yet I must have been aware. When they literally stepped on me,\nit was dark, at night and all of a sudden I felt -- I mean, in -- in the forest there are\nalways a lot of noises, so I didn\u2019t hear them coming. But all of a sudden I felt\nsomething on my chest, and it was, I guess, one of the soldiers. And they realized it was\nsomething alive. And to their credit and my luck, they did clean me up and put me ina\ntent in a -- a military hospital and dragged me with them until we came to the city of\nLuck, L-u-c-k, which is in the area where I come from. And there they found a -- a\nregular hospital and they left me there.

And that and my little penknife I had with me and\nthe gold -- gold coins and whatever else, and jewelry. And I still had one coin and I\ngave it to them, to the two soldiers. I -- I do remember that, that was it. But other than\nthat, there was no real thank you or anything, for giving me back my life. But when I\nended up in the hospital at Luck, that\u2019s where they nursed me back to, I guess,\nreasonable health. I did not speak for a long, long time, and I do remember that -- how I\nregained my speech. I was on a ward. At that time, I mean, there were no private rooms,\nor if there were I wasn\u2019t in one. And I was just in my cot, whatever, in clean sheets, it\nwas wonderful. And -- but I did not speak. And then all of a sudden there was an\nattendant. It was not a doctor and it was not a nurse, but a young woman. And she was\nsort of humming while she was doing things and all of a sudden she started singing a\nsong that my mother used to sing to me. And, I mean it just gave me chills and I started\ntalking. That, you know, brought back my speech. And it was a very, you know,\nemotional day at that time. But when I was nursed back to health, I found there was one\nother survivor from my hometown. And it seemed that most of the survivors -- the war\nwas not over yet in 1944, but for us, for all intents and purposes, the war was over.

And I came out of the hospital, I found a lot of --\nnot a lot, but survivors. And I did meet the other survivor from my hometown.

The people in our hometown -\n- and this was going on all over eastern Poland, I don\u2019t know about other countries, but\nin eastern Po -- what used to be eastern Poland, the populace was very greedy and they\ndid get everything. All our possessions, all our material possessions ended up in their\nhands because when we were ordered to go into the ghetto, we could only take with us\nwhat we could carry, nothing else. And so everything else went to the neighbors and\nwhoever got ahold of it, or -- I don\u2019t know how the Germans and the Ukrainians at that\ntime directed and disposed of all the material goods. And then there were homes,\nhouses. And they felt, I\u2019m sure, the local populace, that whoever survived\n[indecipherable] will come and say now, I want my house back, I want my -- all my\nfurniture back. I want my linens, my silver, my -- all sorts of stuff. And that probably --\nand besides, there was still, and still 1s, there\u2019s great anti-Semitism in that area.

        "A: It was a very nice house, and as a matter of fact, I mean there were still several\nrooms, I think two rooms that were never finished because my father had hoped that we\nwould go to the United States and he, just at that point he didn\u2019t want to put -- we\nweren\u2019t rich, I mean he was an educator. And -- but the thing was that he didn't want to\nput any more money into the house, and he left two rooms or so unfinished, and they\nwere still unfinished at the end of war, or when we came, you know, to -- to see.

And she went back\nthere, and she didn\u2019t find anyone very receptive, very happy about her survival. She\nwas actually hidden by a farmer throughout the entire war. So she had one friend. What\nis SO very puzzling to me -- it\u2019s not puzzling, it\u2019s just very disappointing to this day.\nI\u2019ve gotten rid of the hate and the anger because it was destroying me personally, but I\nfeel a great disappointment by the fact or from the fact that our neighbors and our town,\nwhere we co-existed in a very nice way, my father and mother and other Jewish leaders\nwere working hand in hand with the Gentile population for the good of the entire\ncommunity. And I\u2019m not just saying that, but it\u2019s such a puzzlement to me that friends\nand neighbors who lived in -- in harmony, all of a sudden, overnight could turn into\nenemies, and not one of them helped.

And they were always working and they were poor peasants in the beginning\nand they were poor peasants at the end. And maybe that\u2019s why, I don\u2019t know.

And then from Vienna we finally\nended up in Munich. And in Munich, or right around the area of Munich, we were put\nin what they called DP camps, Displaced Person\u2019s camps.

And so I found a\nplace -- or, they f -- assigned me another place to live. But when my efforts to join my\nfamily in -- in the United States were coming to nothing, I decided that perhaps -- I only\nhad a third grade education -- I decided maybe I could go to school and emigrate on a\nstudent visa. And at that time I felt that -- I don\u2019t know why, but there was a DP camp\nby the name Benzheim and that was between Darmstadt and Frankfurt, and very close\nto Heidelberg. And I\u2019m not sure, but I think my father had a lot of, you know,\ndoctorates, and one of them, I think, was from Heidelberg. And I went to Heidelberg\nand I spoke German at that -- you know, so I asked them if they would take me on as a\nstudent. And they sort of looked me up and down, and where are your papers, you\nknow, from school? And I said I have none. And they were very helpful. They gave me\na tutor and they took all sorts of crazy tests. And because, I guess, I was a Jewish\nsurvivor, they accepted me.

I -- 1t was very\ndifficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war, there were\npogroms in Poland. Not just eastern Poland, but all over Poland. Now, the eastern part\nof Poland, after the war ended, became the property of the Soviet Union. So Poland was\nactually divided. And the Poland that I knew from before the war was no more. It was --\na third of it was chunked off to the Soviet regime. And what was going on all over\nPoland were pogroms, after the war. And the local populace was so resentful of our\nsurviving that to them the only solution of getting rid of us is to kill us. And I don\u2019t\nknow if you\u2019ve ever heard of Kielce. Kielce is someplace -- my geography is not that\ngood, but I think it\u2019s in central Poland. And Kielce was a big town, a big city and had a\nlot of Jews before the war. On the fourth of July, 1946, the local populace got together\nand murdered 42 Jewish survivors. And that was one of the most infamous pogroms. I\nthink they mention it on the second floor in the museum, when they talk about DP\ncamps and all. Kielce, one of the most infamous pogroms. And that was devastating to\nhear when we were in the DP camps, about these happenings. And this was going on all\nover the place in Poland. So when anybody says that now there are no Jews in Poland,\nand consequently there can\u2019t be any anti-Semitism, it ain\u2019t so. It\u2019s not so, and I would\nlike to -- I wanted to make that point.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We were very much involved there,\nat Fort Lee with the Jewish chapel. And that\u2019s where we met a very wonderful man,\nRabbi Elster.

We became\nfast friends, Rabbi Elster and Shulamit Elster, and now they have three married kids.\nBut our friendship started at Fort Lee.

And my husband\nand several -- and other people, the younger, the younger officers said this is ki -- the\nkind of war it cannot be won. But of course, they didn\u2019t listen to them. But, when my\nhusband got orders to Vietnam, I decided in my infinite wisdom -- I\u2019m being sarcastic -\n- to go to Columbus, to stay in Columbus. Why? Because I had family there, my aunt\nwas still there.

And as it happened, my husband was\nin the hotel and left five minutes before the explosion. So, you know, lucky for me and\nfor him. When he came back from Vietnam he was smoking something like two packs\nof cigarettes a day. He was, I think, bone -- skin and bone and his hands were shaking.\nHe -- he was a mess. Very -- I mean, physically very frail. He was a young man at that\ntime. And it wa -- it was very sad to watch.

She did get married, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP\ncamp, in Benzheim. She married a -- a middle -- an older -- mostly it used to be, you\nknow, older men. She married a very nice, very fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af\n-- the brother had also a family and they all -- they all emigrated to America together.\nAnd my friend\u2019s -- Rya is her name -- Rya\u2019s mother was still alive.

And so when the time came, as it was,\nthere was going to be, I think the first gathering of survivors in Washington, D.C., and I\nthink it was 1983, and I attended it. It was not quite a week, but it was more than one\nday, I don\u2019t recall exactly. And there I met many new people, and some whom I have\nknown from the DP camps, and it was nice to be together.

And he made a very emotional and very\nmemorable speech at that meeting, and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in\nBergen-Belsen, where his parents ended up at the end of the war. And when they said, I\nwas born in Bergen-Belsen, people said, oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp? No, at\nthat time it was a DP camp. But he was born in that camp, and he became very active\nand he still is.

I knew I had to do something, I didn\u2019t know what, and I didn\u2019t know what\nI was ready to do. At that point we did belong to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly\nElster the rabbi, was still with us. And I went to him and I said, I want to do something\nto honor the memory of all the ones, the millions who perished in the Holocaust. And\nhe looked at me and right away he says, why don\u2019t you become a Bat Mitzvah? You\nknow what a Bat Mitzvah is, I mean, here. I said, oh, but I don\u2019t know.

And they started observing -- at that time they did already observe it\nat the rotunda, you know, in the Capitol. But our synagogue usually had sort of a\nreligious school, you know, commemoration or something, not as elaborate and all, but\njust to commemorate. And I said well, I don\u2019t know, but if I -- I don\u2019t think I could\nlearn by April, you know, all the chanting and all the Haftorah and everything. Cause I\ndidn\u2019t know any of the blessings in Hebrew, nothing. Didn\u2019t even know how to read.\nAnd he says, I\u2019Il teach you, and he proceeded to teach me. And by April, to make it -- it\nwas very difficult and it took an awful lot of time, and my husband said he could recite\nsome of the prayers in his sleep because he heard me repeating them so many times.\nAnd came f -- when -- when April came, I don\u2019t remember what day, I think it was also\nthe 25\"\" or something, 21\u00b0 or 25\", I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah.\nAnd I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months. And that was very -- a\nvery nice accomplishment. I invited the entire congregation and actually some of my\nrelatives from Columbus, Ohio and New York, and some of them came. And they said\nlater, they said, yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didn\u2019t want you to\nfall on your face without family around. Well, I didn\u2019t fall on my face.

And after that we did attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe\nnot every Saturday or -- but around that time when I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah,\nI did. I wrote a poem for that occasion and I made -- and my remarks were centered\naround the theme that this is Yom HaShoah and I\u2019d like -- this is my way of honoring\nall the millions who perished during the Holocaust.

And consequently he resigned his post and became a drunk for awhile.\nI mean, now he wrote a book and he speaks about this situation. That churns within me\nand it makes me sick, physically ill.

I might be -- I\u2019m probably very wrong, but this is\nmy explanation. And that\u2019s why, until now, am -- most places, I always when I start my\nremarks, since September 11\", I start with the horrible tragedy of September 11\", and I\ncompare it.

We don\u2019t want to have\nto leave our children in such a terrible world, where peace is at que -- in question every\nday. And I don\u2019t know, I -- I\u2019m very glad that I have a child, and I have, hopefully,\ncontinuity. But it is a question to ponder. What are we leaving our children with, when\nwe cannot guarantee them freedom, and freedom is what everyone until now has paid\nsuch a dear price for.",

I know nobody can live without hope. You might as well\ngive up. And I know in my -- in -- in my darkest hours, no matter how I came to\nachieve it, if I tried, you know, to -- to just talk myself into it, but I always felt that I\nmust have hope, and I have hope now. And I think, I mean, it\u2019s no comparison, but\nwhen my husband got so ill, I prayed to God and at that time I said, God, I -- I don\u2019t\ncare what you do, please give me hope that he\u2019s going to go on and he\u2019s going to live.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

There was a Catholic priest -- they\nhave a priest and a rabbi and all at the Walter Reed Hospital, and this priest just start --\njust happened to pass when I was sitting there, and I mean, I wasn\u2019t crying, but I was\nsitting in the corner waiting for some results. And I was -- I looked very sad, and I think\nI was waiting for our son to come and I -- he says -- what -- what\u2019s bothering you, my\nchild? And I told him. And he says, I'll pray for him he\u2019ll be all right. Yeah. And that\nChristmas we went over and we gave him a nice donation. He was there for -- he\u2019s gone\nnow, he\u2019s gone someplace else. But a Catholic priest, you know, had so much\ncompassion. That gives me hope, because there is something good in every human\nbeing. And I also have another philosophy. You know how women get together and\nthey start gossiping and all, and I don\u2019t like to gossip. But I always say, if you don\u2019t\nhave anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything. Say only when you have something nice\nto say, otherwise don\u2019t. And if you feel, you know, anger and all, try to concentrate and\ntry to find something nice about that person.

That\u2019s another thing that I, nowadays feel very strongly\nabout it, and I keep learning much more, 1s the fact that there was so much resistance,\nand there was so much -- there were uprisings, you know, all over the place. Sobibor,\nAuschwitz, and of course, Warsaw. But I was reading someplace just recently that there\nwas resistance in 105 different ghettos. And I think probably it will come up that it -- it\nwas more than 105 ghettos. Cause my mother\u2019s school, that\u2019s resistance. The -- our kids\ngetting together, about 20 of us, building a tunnel. Tunnel, it wasn\u2019t really a tunnel, but\nit was a tunnel. That\u2019s resistance. And these kind of forms of resistance took place\nalmost in every little ghetto. And that is something that when we consider that there\nwas practically no help from the outside, and even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto, how\ndifficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I\nmean, people would, on the outside, would promise you weapons, and then you would\ncome and you\u2019d find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn\u2019t work. And\nwhen you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should\nwalk now with our heads high, too. And I often say I\u2019m very proud to be who I am. I\nwouldn\u2019t change it for the world. And I am proud of being a Jew. And I am proud of\nhaving to sur-survive -- of having survived.

And so I found a\nplace -- or, they f -- assigned me another place to live. But when my efforts to join my\nfamily in -- in the United States were coming to nothing, I decided that perhaps -- I only\nhad a third grade education -- I decided maybe I could go to school and emigrate on a\nstudent visa. And at that time I felt that -- I don\u2019t know why, but there was a DP camp\nby the name Benzheim and that was between Darmstadt and Frankfurt, and very close\nto Heidelberg. And I\u2019m not sure, but I think my father had a lot of, you know,\ndoctorates, and one of them, I think, was from Heidelberg. And I went to Heidelberg\nand I spoke German at that -- you know, so I asked them if they would take me on as a\nstudent. And they sort of looked me up and down, and where are your papers, you\nknow, from school? And I said I have none. And they were very helpful. They gave me\na tutor and they took all sorts of crazy tests. And because, I guess, I was a Jewish\nsurvivor, they accepted me. I stayed there for over a year, and thought that I would go --\nemigrate on a student visa. But by that time my papers started taking on importance and\nI eventually ended up going on the papers that my family provided for me. But it took\nthree years after the war before I ended up in the United States.

I -- 1t was very\ndifficult for me to comprehend and to understand that even after the war, there were\npogroms in Poland. Not just eastern Poland, but all over Poland. Now, the eastern part\nof Poland, after the war ended, became the property of the Soviet Union. So Poland was\nactually divided. And the Poland that I knew from before the war was no more. It was --\na third of it was chunked off to the Soviet regime. And what was going on all over\nPoland were pogroms, after the war. And the local populace was so resentful of our\nsurviving that to them the only solution of getting rid of us is to kill us. And I don\u2019t\nknow if you\u2019ve ever heard of Kielce. Kielce is someplace -- my geography is not that\ngood, but I think it\u2019s in central Poland. And Kielce was a big town, a big city and had a\nlot of Jews before the war. On the fourth of July, 1946, the local populace got together\nand murdered 42 Jewish survivors. And that was one of the most infamous pogroms. I\nthink they mention it on the second floor in the museum, when they talk about DP\ncamps and all. Kielce, one of the most infamous pogroms. And that was devastating to\nhear when we were in the DP camps, about these happenings. And this was going on all\nover the place in Poland. So when anybody says that now there are no Jews in Poland,\nand consequently there can\u2019t be any anti-Semitism, it ain\u2019t so. It\u2019s not so, and I would\nlike to -- I wanted to make that point.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

So\nagain I -- he\u2019d go for two weeks and come back maybe for three days. And so it was,\nyou know, that I was there for my s -- for our son. We were very much involved there,\nat Fort Lee with the Jewish chapel. And that\u2019s where we met a very wonderful man,\nRabbi Elster.

We became\nfast friends, Rabbi Elster and Shulamit Elster, and now they have three married kids.\nBut our friendship started at Fort Lee.

He was very much against our\ninvolvement in Vietnam, and when he got -- but he was in the military and they ordered\nhim, so he went. He expressed his, I guess his views to the higher ups, and he wasn\u2019t\nthe only one, because he said, this is a kind of war that we cannot win, because we are\ntrained to conduct a -- a re -- what do you call it, a -- a regular war, and these people are\nnot terrorists, but they are guerillas and they were fighting the war in Vietnam from the\nunderground. They had th -- we went to Vietnam just five years ago, and I saw these\ntunnels and all. They were fighting everything from the underground. And my husband\nand several -- and other people, the younger, the younger officers said this is ki -- the\nkind of war it cannot be won. But of course, they didn\u2019t listen to them. But, when my\nhusband got orders to Vietnam, I decided in my infinite wisdom -- I\u2019m being sarcastic -\n- to go to Columbus, to stay in Columbus. Why? Because I had family there, my aunt\nwas still there. I -- so I rented an apartment near where she lived, and enrolled my son,\nat that time I think he was in third grade, and he had his cousins there, you know. I say\ncousins, but they were my cousins, but he counted them as his cousins. And we lived\nthe year that my husband was in Vietnam in Columbus, Ohio.

        "A: Because some of these people went to Canada. And I even got into a fight at an\nairpor -- at the airport. And there were some young people picketing, you know, and\nprotesting the war. And at that time I felt my husband is there, I didn\u2019t know the\nsituation, but his country, right or wrong. And he\u2019s serving his country, he\u2019s there. And\nI didn\u2019t like the way they propr -- they were protesting and screaming, you know, and\ncursing and all, and I slapped one guy in the face. I almost ended up in jail. But that was\nmy experience you know, in -- in Columbus. It was not a good experience. And after\nthat, when my husband came back -- and that -- that first year was also very -- I did get\na call that my husband was killed and that was -- he was assigned again with petroleum.\nAll the oils and the jet fuels and all for -- for the entire area.

And as it happened, my husband was\nin the hotel and left five minutes before the explosion. So, you know, lucky for me and\nfor him. When he came back from Vietnam he was smoking something like two packs\nof cigarettes a day. He was, I think, bone -- skin and bone and his hands were shaking.\nHe -- he was a mess. Very -- I mean, physically very frail. He was a young man at that\ntime. And it wa -- it was very sad to watch. And then when he came, with the reception\nhe got in Columbus was just absolutely dem-demoralizing.

But this time he was going to Play Ku, which is the mountainous area.\nAnd he -- this time he had his own chopper and he had to supply the fuels not just for\nVietnam, but for the entire area of all the countries around, a very big job. And he had\nto -- actually had to build the pipes and all that go. And there again, he spent a -- a year,\nthat was -- had many close calls.

Peculiarities or for my idiosyncrasies. I was his mother, and as his mother he\nloved me the way I am. And that was his main argument, that it didn\u2019t have anything to\ndo with being a survivor. He accepted me the way I was. He didn\u2019t blame it on the\nHolocaust or on my being a survivor, why I had temper tantrums, why I yelled at him,\nwhy I wanted him to be better than perfect.

And I was settled. In other words, we didn\u2019t have to move again like in a year or\nso.

She did get married, like you were mentioning, in -- at the DP\ncamp, in Benzheim. She married a -- a middle -- an older -- mostly it used to be, you\nknow, older men. She married a very nice, very fine fellow, and he had a brother, and af\n-- the brother had also a family and they all -- they all emigrated to America together.\nAnd my friend\u2019s -- Rya is her name -- Rya\u2019s mother was still alive.

And at that time\nit wasn\u2019t that I felt the need for it, I Just felt it was time to get in touch in with other\nsurvivors. Maybe it was a need, I don\u2019t know, but I felt 1t was time because I was in one\nplace and I wasn\u2019t going to go overseas again. And so when the time came, as it was,\nthere was going to be, I think the first gathering of survivors in Washington, D.C., and I\nthink it was 1983, and I attended it. It was not quite a week, but it was more than one\nday, I don\u2019t recall exactly. And there I met many new people, and some whom I have\nknown from the DP camps, and it was nice to be together. It was a rather emotional and\nsolemn gathering. And most of the people that I knew have settled and have also started\ntheir own lives and were successful in becoming Americanized.

And he made a very emotional and very\nmemorable speech at that meeting, and he was telling us -- he was -- he was born in\nBergen-Belsen, where his parents ended up at the end of the war. And when they said, I\nwas born in Bergen-Belsen, people said, oh in a deep -- in a concentration camp? No, at\nthat time it was a DP camp. But he was born in that camp, and he became very active\nand he still is. I forgot his first name, but you know, that I remember from that meeting.\nAnd after that meeting, things were quiet, but it\u2019s sort of like -- it gave me a little seed\nin my mind. I knew I had to do something, I didn\u2019t know what, and I didn\u2019t know what\nI was ready to do. At that point we did belong to Agudas Achim and our friend Shelly\nElster the rabbi, was still with us. And I went to him and I said, I want to do something\nto honor the memory of all the ones, the millions who perished in the Holocaust. And\nhe looked at me and right away he says, why don\u2019t you become a Bat Mitzvah? You\nknow what a Bat Mitzvah is, I mean, here. I said, oh, but I don\u2019t know. And Hebrew, I\ndon\u2019t know any prayers. I mean, you know, I-I was really an ignoramus when it came\nto, you know, Hebrew reading, and chanting and all that. He says, I\u2019ll teach you.

And they started observing -- at that time they did already observe it\nat the rotunda, you know, in the Capitol. But our synagogue usually had sort of a\nreligious school, you know, commemoration or something, not as elaborate and all, but\njust to commemorate. And I said well, I don\u2019t know, but if I -- I don\u2019t think I could\nlearn by April, you know, all the chanting and all the Haftorah and everything. Cause I\ndidn\u2019t know any of the blessings in Hebrew, nothing. Didn\u2019t even know how to read.\nAnd he says, I\u2019Il teach you, and he proceeded to teach me. And by April, to make it -- it\nwas very difficult and it took an awful lot of time, and my husband said he could recite\nsome of the prayers in his sleep because he heard me repeating them so many times.\nAnd came f -- when -- when April came, I don\u2019t remember what day, I think it was also\nthe 25\"\" or something, 21\u00b0 or 25\", I was ready for my -- for becoming a Bat Mitzvah.\nAnd I learned all the chanting and all this in the three months. And that was very -- a\nvery nice accomplishment. I invited the entire congregation and actually some of my\nrelatives from Columbus, Ohio and New York, and some of them came. And they said\nlater, they said, yeah we came because we felt sorry for you and we didn\u2019t want you to\nfall on your face without family around. Well, I didn\u2019t fall on my face. I astounded\nthem all because I did the whole thing. Usually kids, you know, learn from very\nbeginning and then it takes them a year or so.

And after that we did attend synagogue pretty regularly, maybe\nnot every Saturday or -- but around that time when I was preparing for my Bat Mitzvah,\nI did. I wrote a poem for that occasion and I made -- and my remarks were centered\naround the theme that this is Yom HaShoah and I\u2019d like -- this is my way of honoring\nall the millions who perished during the Holocaust. And it was -- I felt very good about\nit. Well, at this time my wonderful rabbi was preparing kids for their confirmation class\n-- I mean for their graduation, they have Hebrew school and then, you know, religious\nschool and then the people -- the students who want to go on after their bat mit -- Bar\nand Bat Mitzvah when -- they call them to confirmation class. And he says, you must\ngo and speak to my kids in confirmation class. And I looked at him, I said, Shelly, I\ncannot do that. I -- my English isn\u2019t good.

I was petrified, and I mean, I -- I was not a public\nspeaker, not that I am now, but I -- I -- it was very difficult and it was really, I mean, he\npushed me and I was angry with him that he did. But 1t was a wonderful beginning. Not\na wonderful, but a beginning of something that I realized I had to do.

And then when\nthey finished listening to the description and going through the rooms, they -- each one\nwould receive a tile, and they had to register their impressions with painting a\nstatement. And -- you know, they gave them paint and -- and the tiles. And this one\ntime there were two kids in that group, from two different classes, but the same school.\nAnd of course they always had chaperones, and this father, this one man, came over to\nme.

And I made it very simple, because it -- these were young kids.\nBut after I was finished this guy comes over, and there were several parents, obviously,\nyou know, with the kids and they were always very nice and asked meaningful\nquestions.

And I -- he was looking to see that people will start laughing. It\nwas dead silence. I said, as far as I\u2019m concerned, even one was too many. And are you\nsatisfied now that you made your joke?

And consequently he resigned his post and became a drunk for awhile.\nI mean, now he wrote a book and he speaks about this situation. That churns within me\nand it makes me sick, physically ill. All this, Bosnia and all that. But to the American\npsyche, I think one of the most important thing, do anything, but don\u2019t come to my\nbeloved America, to my soil, on my soil. Don\u2019t do anything on my soil. And sin the --\nsince the Civil War and all, all the wars were fought outside of the United States. And\nSeptember 11\", sadly, touched us right here. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to the\nAmericans. That\u2019s the way I figure. I also have seen something here that I was missing\nall these years. We went to Israel, can\u2019t remember when, in the 80\u2019s, and the first thing\nthat struck me was the fantastic pride and patriotism that the people have.

Since September 11\", you\nsee stickers, I\u2019m proud to be an American. You see the flag on cars and I think it did\nawake our patriotism and our pride in being an American. And it didn't do that when\nChechnya started, when Bosnia started, when Uganda started, when -- when all these\nother terrible, you know, wars started su -- on a different soil, not on American soil.\nAnd this is why I think it\u2019s different. I might be -- I\u2019m probably very wrong, but this is\nmy explanation.

And there was one guy there who was my father\u2019s student.

And these kind of forms of resistance took place\nalmost in every little ghetto. And that is something that when we consider that there\nwas practically no help from the outside, and even in -- in the Warsaw ghetto, how\ndifficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I\nmean, people would, on the outside, would promise you weapons, and then you would\ncome and you\u2019d find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn\u2019t work. And\nwhen you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should\nwalk now with our heads high, too. And I often say I\u2019m very proud to be who I am. I\nwouldn\u2019t change it for the world. And I am proud of being a Jew. And I am proud of\nhaving to sur-survive -- of having survived. But until recently, I had enormous guilt.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

        "A: Well, you know, I went back to my hometown and that was a disaster.

My father, at first they told me he was -- he pa -- I guess the people in my\ntown -- excuse me, that he went to Dachau, the concentration -- Dachau concentration\ncamp. And when I was in the DP camp, and later when my husband and I were\nstationed in Munich -- excuse me -- we went to Dachau to search all the papers. Didn\u2019t\nfind anything. And then, when I went in 1988 to my hometown, I was told that the 300\nleaders were led from our hometown to the outside of the town to a -- one of the forests,\nthere are lots of forests around. I don\u2019t know if they kept them one day or two or three.\nThey made them dig a mass grave and then they shot them there and then. I don\u2019t know\nwhich is the true story. I did not see the grave. I hope before I die I will go back to my\nhometown and have answers to some of these burning questions. Maybe not all of\nthem, but some. If there is a grave, I feel that\u2019s probably where he lost his life. I -- and\nif it\u2019s so, I -- my aim is to put some plaques, memorial plaques where the ghetto was,\nwhich is now a leveled space, and I hope someone will show me the mass grave, and I\ncould put some memorial plaque there.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

My house 1s still there, which again doesn\u2019t look like my house, but it was a\nvery traumatic return to my hometown. Nothing was the way I remembered it and most\nof the houses were gone and I don\u2019t know, but my -- our theory is that there must have\nbeen some kind of a experiment which turned sour. I\u2019m not saying it was Chernobyl or\nanything, but -- I don\u2019t know what it was, but something occurred 1n that little town of\nmine that leveled everything and there is nothing there now.

And I try -- I said, I -- Is -- I was so disoriented, and I asked the people there,\nwhere\u2019s the river? No more river, they diverted the river, too. So, I mean, everything\nwas so traumatic and so puzzling, to this day I don\u2019t know if any of the facts or if\nanything they said 1s the truth, but I have to believe someone.
