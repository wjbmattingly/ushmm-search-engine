We had to, some animals in our\nroom, and sometimes I had to sit near the awning, on the window, because I was so afraid, it was\nso unpleasant.

        "Q: Where were the toilets? Were they in your home?",
        "A: Oh no, no, we had one home for whole floor. It was also not so easy.",
        "Q: Outside?",

We had to go out, everybody, the whole inhabitants of Terezin, to Boholovitz-cat-lo-trina\n(ph), we had to go on foot. And they had us to stay the whole day and they counted us, how\nmany we are, and we were afraid because many planes were flying above us and we were afraid\nthey will put bombs to us and they will kill us, everybody. And it was nearly dark, the whole day\nfrom morning, we were staying without food, without anything and waiting, if they will kill us or\nwhat will be.

And we had to work hard. We had to\n, we had to dig and it was a hard work for a child.",
        "Q: What were you digging?",
        "A: Well I think they only wanted us to work hard. There was never a day, they think it was so\nhard and so frozen, these airs, and we had to, what we dig we had to give it one, on a place, and\nafter we had to continue. And this, after the war, when I studied piano at the conservatory, I had\nsome difficulties with it because my hands were swollen every winter and it took two or three\nyears and after I could play without difficulties.",
        "Q: Did you play with little boys also, or just the girls were together?",
        "A: Oh no, we had a good friendship with the boys home, L-40017 and we were Number 28 and\nwe were friends with the Room Number 9.

But she couldn't have it because she\nhad to give everything, she had to leave everything there.",
        "Q: Can you remember what you were thinking when you said good-bye to your sister?",
        "A: Oh, it was a tragedy because I didn't, I was not sure, I had so bad feeling, I was afraid that\nshe, I will never more see her. But we were lucky, she came, but she was very, very ill.",
        "Q: Was your mother nearby at that time?",
        "A: Yes, but only I went with my sister because it was not so easy. It was forbidden to go and I\ncame, I went with her to the last place I could. Because it was danger that they will take me also.\nAnd I had to stay with my parents, they were older, and so.",
        "Q: So you developed close friends?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How were you able to help each other in the home?",
        "A: We were together cleaning. When somebody was sad, we were speaking to him. We were\ntrying to make jokes. Everybody who needs everything we do, we did, we were dreaming\ntogether. For example, a friend of mine, she's living now in Vienna, and she wrote a diary, the\nfilm was done, about it, and we were many, many evenings sitting together and we were\ndreaming. I wanted to study music at the conservatory and she wanted to study acting. And we\nwere thinking endlessly about how it will be nice when we will be back home and we will be\ntogether.",
        "Q: So you all talked about what would happen in the future?",
        "A: Yes, we were thinking of the future because the present time, it was not so sure for us, we\ndidn't know, for example, when my friends went to , | have some letters from\nthem, and they were writing me letters. And we didn't know if we will see each\nother. And one friend of mine was writing me and, oh, when I will sign, I will write to you a\nletter from this place where I will be, but when I will sign that I am \"Mil-ka\" (ph), sincerely\nyours, Mil-ka (ph). I am in good place. But when I will sign \"I am your Milshka (ph), it is a bad\nplace. Such, we were thinking, but she never wrote me and she never came back.",
        "Q: But you all thought that you would get through this?",
        "A: Yes, I don't know why I didn't get a paper that I have to go to . I think that it\nwas this, that everybody, every girl, nearly everybody that was born 1930 was sending to\n, but when we arrived to Terezin my mother wrote me, wrote into the paper and\nsaid that I was born in 1931. In this time, I was very angry because I was in the, I was a girl, I\nwanted to be older, no, I'm not younger, but maybe it saved my life. I don't know, it may be. We\nstayed only four, from our room, to the end of the Terezin-schatz (ph). Everybody from us went\nto . And we were, maybe, with these changes, we were maybe about 150 or more,\nonly four we stayed in Terezin until the end. But now, after 40 years, we found each other and\nwe are living ten, alive, in America, in Vienna, in Israel, in Czech Republic and in Germany.",
        "Q: After your sister left, did a lot of people leave at that time?",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was nearly every two or three days they were transported...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Question: Okay.",
        "Answer: Yes, nearly, I remember that nearly every two or three days in one time there were\ntransports to and also my sister went. I told you, and many, many of my friends.\nThey wrote me five letters and I have them and I copied it for museum in the and\nI will copy it also in the Holocaust Museum in Washington because they are, you can have the\nfeeling, you can read what we felt in this time. That we were very sad and that we liked each\nother and we were not sure that we will see each other again.",
        "Q: How did you know they were, where they were going to?",
        "A: Oh, we didn't know. It was not sure, but somebody told us that it was ;\nsomebody told us after, they would say they were gassed rooms and they were killed. Somebody\ncame after, at the end of the war, a little earlier, they had told it to us, but we were not sure.",
        "Q: As time went on, did the security, the guards and everything, did that become more strict or\nless strict?",
        "A: I think that it was, 1n one time it was more strict. But when it was nearly end of war I went to\nthe place where people in very bad health came to Terezin. I was waiting my friends, I was\nwaiting my sister, | was waiting my brother, and I was staying there hours and hours. And I\nnever forget this unhappy people who had not strength to walk or had not strength to live and we\nwere helping there and giving them something, what we have, and we found, also, some friends\nfrom us, or we talked to neighbors, \"oh, your relative is here, please go and treat him\". But my\nsister didn't come. We got only a letter that she's alive, that she's very ill, that she's in Bergen-\nBelsen and after she went to and some English soldiers liberated her and an\nEnglish doctor saved her life because she was very, very ill. And for many, many years, for\nabout 40 years, I didn't like to think about it because after war, when I came home, I wanted to\nlive normal. I didn't want to speak with many people about what happened to us. Also, some\npeople told us, \"oh, why came you back, why didn't you stay there\", and it was very painful. I\ndidn't like for 40 years to think very deeply about it because every time, when I started to think\nand to talk about what happened to us and to my friends and to my relatives, I was really ill\nabout it. I was so, trembling and I wanted to live normal and to study normal and to work good,\nbut something stayed. For example, I was so happy to be able to study, that they allowed me to\nstudy, that when I had students which didn't work, I was nearly furious. I told them, \"How you\ncan dare not to work? You don't know that people, children or young people, couldn't learn\nanything, that they were in concentration camps\", and so on. And this was a very strong feeling\nfor me because I was, everyday telling, thank you that I can live a normal life. And because I was\nevery time so excited that, in that way about it, when I was speaking with somebody, I wanted to,\ndidn't want to speak too much about it and I didn't visit Terezin 40 years after the war. And after\nthe 40 years I found the strength and I went there with my son and it was very good that I went\nbecause I saw a nearly normal village. In the home where we were living, nobody wrote that we,\nthat they were sometimes almost starving children and that this happened and this happened.\nAnd after, I told to me, oh, you cannot thinking in this way, you have to be quiet and only you\ncan work for the future. That never will the same thing will happen to children and to people.\nAnd for this reason I am working in Terezin, 1n it's archive, in Prague, and I'm working also in\nmy town, Berno (ph), in the staff of Jewish society.",
        "Q: I want to go back a little. You were saying that sometime late in 1944 there were many, many\ntransports?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When your sister left?",
        "A: Yes. Also my brother left.",
        "Q: And you knew that your brother left, at that time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And when there were only a very few children left in that home, did you stay in that home?",
        "A: No, no, no, we had to go out. And we had this and we were four and we didn't,\nwe couldn't decide who will have it and we divided it for, into four pieces, and only my piece 1s\nalive. And it is now here by my friend and we will do, have a construction, we will write a book\nabout our friends who didn't return, and write about them, and about our life, something, and also\nthe diary of Helga Kinski (ph) where she's written about life in our children's home. And we\nwould like that everybody can read these things, maybe it will, we will have good conditions to\nbring to it.",
        "Q: So after you went out, where did you go? When you left the children's home?",
        "A: After I went with my parents into this military , and I am not sure if 1t was\nBergem-Bach (ph) or Magdeburg, but I think that 1t was Magdeburg and we had a very small\npiece and we were living there. It was a room divided and we had maybe, I don't know how\nmany meters, three meters, and we were living there. And once it happened that I was alone at\nhome and that I was cleaning the window, I was staying in the window, and one man came. I\nthought it was an SS man, it was Mr. Mumelstein (ph) and he came and he kick to the door and\nhe was shouting a little bit on me and looking not in very good way of me and I was, I had some\nminutes of, I was very afraid that he will throw me from the window, from the second floor\ndown. But, in one moment, he turned and he went and it was not very nice.",
        "Q: So your parents were working in the day and you stayed home?",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was by chance that I was at home because I was also working.",
        "Q: Were there other episodes that were very frightening to you?",
        "A: No, besides with this counting in this Bolshevik (ph) when we stayed there a whole\nday, it was very bad. And every transport was a very, very bad experience for us because we\nhave to say farewell to people which were, who were for us very, very dear and we didn't know\nif we will see them and this was very hard. And we were afraid that everyday we will, we were\non the row and we will go. And we felt that it was not a good place where the SS go.",
        "Q: Did you ever see people being punished or beaten?",
        "A: [heard about it. I heard that somebody, when somebody wanted to fly, that they were hanging\nthere and they were shooting, yes. But I didn't see it. I saw only when somebody was shouting\nand so forth.",
        "Q: Toward the end were there a lot of sick people around?",
        "A: Yes. Also, when it was finishing we had also a big epidemic of typhus. And they took us\nchildren to one sanatorium outside of Terezin. We were one month outside and they were\ntreating us and giving us meal and treating us from the medical side. And my mother and father\nhad to stay in Terezin and after we went back and after we went home.",
        "Q: This was after liberation?",
        "A: After liberation, yes. We went home in June, not in May.",
        "Q: But the sanitar1um was after liberation?",
        "A: After liberation, but nobody could go out from Terezin because it was an epidemic.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you remember the Red Cross visit?",
        "A: Yes, I remember. Because we had the SS, , and he gave us to eat and we\nhad to tell him, \" , \", \"again we have sardines\", and\nso it was like for , religious. And they built shops and caf\u00e9 houses and in these\nshops we got also tickets that we can shop all money, we had also money, that we can buy there,\nbut nothing was there, only I remember and some things like this, but we didn't,\nwe couldn't buy because nothing was there. It was only like for this , this\nvillages. And when the Red Cross came, then we had to clean everything and they chose also\nchildren, they looked well, they didn't, they were not too slim, and it was like a theater, like a\nspectacle. And we got a piece of bread and we were eating and like this. In film you can also see\nit.",
        "Q: This must have seemed strange to you?",
        "A: Yes, but we were happy to have a piece of bread!",
        "Q: So you acted for them?",
        "A: Yes, but we had to do it.",
        "Q: What else do you remember about Terezin?",
        "A: I remember only that I was happy that we could leave. I was happy that my brother came to\nTerezin in the uniform of U.S. Army because when he flew from this, when they moved from the\nMalyy-Trostenetz concentration camp and when the war was ended, and he got, I don't know\nhow, to the U.S. Army because he was speaking very well English, he was helping, and he came\nto, with the U.S. Army to Czech country and then it was only possible, he came to look if we are\nalive. And I was the first, I saw him. And I was so happy! And after we got a letter from my\nsister, and it was also nice, and after we were looking forward to the time when we can leave.\nBut the people who went, who came back from other concentration camps were in such bad\nhealth that I never forget these people. How they came, because they were exhausted and I think\nafter some days they wouldn't want to be alive.",
        "Q: I read that the people who lived in Terezin-stat were able to get food packages from around\nthe world. Is that true? Did you have enough food?",
        "A: One time it was possible, but we didn't have anybody to send us something.",
        "Q: Maybe Jewish organizations, or?",
        "A: Nobody. I think it was so many people that it was not possible. And these Jewish\norganizations, they are also dying. Only when somebody was from, maybe a Christian woman\nand a Jewish father and children, maybe she, they were both in Prague or another town, and she\ncould send something. It was something, possible, but also we got a letter from my sister, we got\na letter to Terezin. But it was only a card, that she's alive. But nothing more.",
        "Q: Did you have radios?",
        "A: No, we had to give everything. And 1n this time, I think the small radios were not yet.",
        "Q: Did you have any knowledge about what was going on with the war and the camps and all\nthat?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. We had to because people were speaking about it. I don't know how they could\nhave it, but I can tell you that when we were liberated, we were inside when the guns were\nworking, when we were liberated I, every time I was dreaming, how I was happy. How I will be\njumping when the liberation will be. I can tell you that I was so exhausted that I couldn't feel the\nreal happiness. After a long time, I could feel it. And my brother wrote a poem about it and it\nexpress also my feelings, also when we were in another place. Because I cannot translate it to\nyou. I am liberated with, 1t was asking, yes? Can I live as before? It was too much. I went\nthrough so many hard and difficult situations that it will take me a long time if I can be, I can feel\nthat I am liberated, I am a human being, I can live normal. It is inside me and it 1s like a stone,\nyes? And I could feel, I was a child, I was not yet 15, I was 14-years-old and I can tell you that I\ncouldn't be so happy. I was so exhausted from this waiting and waiting and seeing what\nhappened.",
        "Q: At the time of liberation, and you were liberated by what army?",
        "A: By Russian army and English. The English were a little less, but English soldiers were there. I\ncan remember it.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: They came. First we were hidden. After, when it was, a little quiet we came out and they were\nsinging. We were thanking them and after we were looking what to do. What to have to eat.\nWhat to, because after this we had to take care about ourselves alone.",
        "Q: So they didn't stay very long?",
        "A: Oh, they stayed. They stood, I think, the whole time. Because after I went towards the\nsanatorium, I cannot tell you everything because I was one months out from Terezin.",

It was not so easy because\nwe didn't have money. Our fate was not free, and we got only 500 crowns and from U.S. Army,\nsaid, oh, we could go somewhere to eat something, but we couldn't eat\nbecause our stomachs were not use to eat too much and we had some difficulties. Now I started\nto look, what shall I study? And I forgot nearly everything from my knowing to play piano and I\nwanted to go to conservatory and I was looking for it to work very hard to again do exam. It\nlasted one year. I had to do exams from the normal school because I didn't have schools, yes?\nAnd I can tell you that in Terezin, we had so good professors. I had good marks, only I studied\nonly mathematics, math. And I got through. The life was hard, but I was so drinking the life that\nI was attending, for example, cinema. At four o'clock, six o'clock and eight o'clock! But I didn't\nknow what it was because there were three films, but I had to live. I wanted to live and funny\nthings I did, such un-normal things.",

And my sister, second sister was living in\nIsrael and my second sister, this dancer, she was so ill after the war, she had tuberculosis, she\nwas in sanatorium. We couldn't leave it.

And we\ncould live in this flat, but we had to pay, furniture, not too much, but it was so hard for us. My\nfather had to borrow money from bank and had to start to a new life and he started to work and\nto build his shop again. But, when he gave back this money, it was three years, it lasted three\nyears.

Why didn't you stay there?\" And, \"this was not\nnormal girl\", and \"everybody was laughing about her\", and before war, I was the one, I was\nevery time telling, \"why you are laughing? She cannot, she is a poor girl\", and as to things we\nhad hidden by our neighbors, nearly everybody told us that they had bombs and they have\nnothing more. And we got only one small thing, one small statue from the house from my\nmother, it was remembering her house, and she was happy. But we didn't care about what we\nhave because it was not the important thing. The important thing was that we were free, that we\ncould live, we could work, and I could study. And we could take a little care about, to improve\nour health.",
        "Q: How important was religion to you, during Terezin and afterwards?",
        "A: I can tell you that I lost my religion in Terezin because I was praying for my friends and\nnothing happened. And I was quarreling with the God. And asking Him, \"why he is so cruel and\nhe let these things to work?\" No, He didn't answer me. For this reason, I only was feeling that I\nam a member of a group of people that had the same destiny, and I was proud of this big\ntradition, this old tradition. I was proud that I was a Jewish and I told everybody that I am\nJewish, but I didn't practice the religion. After, when my father died, I came a little bit back.",

We,\nI think that it was a, so good school that, also, after the war, the life was not every time so easy.\nThat we could go through a little bit lighter than other people. Because we had harder times.\n[end of side one of Tape 2. ]",

We wanted to leave and we were working very hard and we\nwanted to, what we couldn't do in the concentration camp, we wanted to do everything better and\nwe were very, very, very hard working. Because it was not so easy for us who didn't have\nschools, although when we read something, but it was not everything. And we had to run, to run\nvery quickly to do everything in time.",

Also, with my\nstudents, I told you that I was very strong and very serious. They had to work hard and they\nneeded to be honest and to be helpful and to be deeper, to be deep. Not only to do it, everything\nso. I think I was also, not only a professor of music, but I was like a mother or aunt, and I think\nthat they were also, they work and they laugh for this, what they did. They were a little bit\ndeeper. It was somebody or couldn't be deep, but mostly they were.",

And not to feel that our body was weak and we had\ndifficulties. We wanted to work as nothing happened and we wanted to forget. And it, the cost\nwas of, many great strength and a great fear. But we did it. I could study, I had a degree. I did,\ntwice, conservatory. Not only once, I did as a pianist, after as a singer.

They are, and also when we meet together with my friends who came back, we were\nspeaking about our life in concentration camp, but we don't like to speak about the bad things.\nWe were only speaking, not only sometimes, also, but we were, we are speaking about good\nthings, what we did, about the life there, about helping each other, about friendship, about these\ngirls who didn't come back and what we can do that they are not so forgotten. We will do that,\nwe will bring the book, we will write about it. I think many books are now here. The museum is\nfull of new books. I was there.

And also I can tell you, everything what I did, I\nwas doing, I tried to do good and well because I was a member of a nation who was, I cannot\ntell, haunted, yes? And that many gospels were about us and I wanted to show that I am a normal\nhuman being. That I can do good work, that I am a good, I was trying to me to be good, to do the\nright things. That nobody can say, \"Oh, look, this is a Jew and Jews are bad people\". And I was\nnot working for me, my and everything what I did, I did in, as I am delegate of all\nJews.",

        "A: No. Only I can say that I was visiting here in this museum that's, I can tell thank you for it. It\nis good, very good done. It is simple, it is human, it is not show. Every soul who is able to feel, I\nthink that everybody can have an impression of what happened and that I wish that everybody\nwho is through to see it, that will be in his life a good person and say, don't alive these persons,\nallow, that don't allow these things to be repeated.",

        "A: Yes, I could see her until this time, but then she went to Aus-wick-im (ph), it was in 1944,\nafter.",
        "A: She got the paper that she has to go. And I went with her nearly to the train. I gave her these\nnice boots because they were very warm for winter. These people who were shouting before war,\n\"give, you pig, give me your boots!\", I gave it to my sister. But she couldn't have it because she\nhad to give everything, she had to leave everything there.",
        "A: Oh, it was a tragedy because I didn't, I was not sure, I had so bad feeling, I was afraid that\nshe, I will never more see her. But we were lucky, she came, but she was very, very ill.",
        "A: Yes, but only I went with my sister because it was not so easy. It was forbidden to go and I\ncame, I went with her to the last place I could. Because it was danger that they will take me also.\nAnd I had to stay with my parents, they were older, and so.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We were together cleaning. When somebody was sad, we were speaking to him. We were\ntrying to make jokes. Everybody who needs everything we do, we did, we were dreaming\ntogether. For example, a friend of mine, she's living now in Vienna, and she wrote a diary, the\nfilm was done, about it, and we were many, many evenings sitting together and we were\ndreaming. I wanted to study music at the conservatory and she wanted to study acting. And we\nwere thinking endlessly about how it will be nice when we will be back home and we will be\ntogether.",
        "A: Yes, we were thinking of the future because the present time, it was not so sure for us, we\ndidn't know, for example, when my friends went to , | have some letters from\nthem, and they were writing me letters. And we didn't know if we will see each\nother. And one friend of mine was writing me and, oh, when I will sign, I will write to you a\nletter from this place where I will be, but when I will sign that I am \"Mil-ka\" (ph), sincerely\nyours, Mil-ka (ph). I am in good place. But when I will sign \"I am your Milshka (ph), it is a bad\nplace. Such, we were thinking, but she never wrote me and she never came back.",
        "A: Yes, I don't know why I didn't get a paper that I have to go to . I think that it\nwas this, that everybody, every girl, nearly everybody that was born 1930 was sending to\n, but when we arrived to Terezin my mother wrote me, wrote into the paper and\nsaid that I was born in 1931. In this time, I was very angry because I was in the, I was a girl, I\nwanted to be older, no, I'm not younger, but maybe it saved my life. I don't know, it may be. We\nstayed only four, from our room, to the end of the Terezin-schatz (ph). Everybody from us went\nto . And we were, maybe, with these changes, we were maybe about 150 or more,\nonly four we stayed in Terezin until the end. But now, after 40 years, we found each other and\nwe are living ten, alive, in America, in Vienna, in Israel, in Czech Republic and in Germany.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was nearly every two or three days they were transported...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Answer: Yes, nearly, I remember that nearly every two or three days in one time there were\ntransports to and also my sister went. I told you, and many, many of my friends.\nThey wrote me five letters and I have them and I copied it for museum in the and\nI will copy it also in the Holocaust Museum in Washington because they are, you can have the\nfeeling, you can read what we felt in this time. That we were very sad and that we liked each\nother and we were not sure that we will see each other again.",
        "A: Oh, we didn't know. It was not sure, but somebody told us that it was ;\nsomebody told us after, they would say they were gassed rooms and they were killed. Somebody\ncame after, at the end of the war, a little earlier, they had told it to us, but we were not sure.",
        "A: I think that it was, 1n one time it was more strict. But when it was nearly end of war I went to\nthe place where people in very bad health came to Terezin. I was waiting my friends, I was\nwaiting my sister, | was waiting my brother, and I was staying there hours and hours. And I\nnever forget this unhappy people who had not strength to walk or had not strength to live and we\nwere helping there and giving them something, what we have, and we found, also, some friends\nfrom us, or we talked to neighbors, \"oh, your relative is here, please go and treat him\". But my\nsister didn't come. We got only a letter that she's alive, that she's very ill, that she's in Bergen-\nBelsen and after she went to and some English soldiers liberated her and an\nEnglish doctor saved her life because she was very, very ill. And for many, many years, for\nabout 40 years, I didn't like to think about it because after war, when I came home, I wanted to\nlive normal. I didn't want to speak with many people about what happened to us. Also, some\npeople told us, \"oh, why came you back, why didn't you stay there\", and it was very painful. I\ndidn't like for 40 years to think very deeply about it because every time, when I started to think\nand to talk about what happened to us and to my friends and to my relatives, I was really ill\nabout it. I was so, trembling and I wanted to live normal and to study normal and to work good,\nbut something stayed. For example, I was so happy to be able to study, that they allowed me to\nstudy, that when I had students which didn't work, I was nearly furious. I told them, \"How you\ncan dare not to work? You don't know that people, children or young people, couldn't learn\nanything, that they were in concentration camps\", and so on. And this was a very strong feeling\nfor me because I was, everyday telling, thank you that I can live a normal life. And because I was\nevery time so excited that, in that way about it, when I was speaking with somebody, I wanted to,\ndidn't want to speak too much about it and I didn't visit Terezin 40 years after the war. And after\nthe 40 years I found the strength and I went there with my son and it was very good that I went\nbecause I saw a nearly normal village. In the home where we were living, nobody wrote that we,\nthat they were sometimes almost starving children and that this happened and this happened.\nAnd after, I told to me, oh, you cannot thinking in this way, you have to be quiet and only you\ncan work for the future. That never will the same thing will happen to children and to people.\nAnd for this reason I am working in Terezin, 1n it's archive, in Prague, and I'm working also in\nmy town, Berno (ph), in the staff of Jewish society.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Also my brother left.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no, we had to go out. And we had this and we were four and we didn't,\nwe couldn't decide who will have it and we divided it for, into four pieces, and only my piece 1s\nalive. And it is now here by my friend and we will do, have a construction, we will write a book\nabout our friends who didn't return, and write about them, and about our life, something, and also\nthe diary of Helga Kinski (ph) where she's written about life in our children's home. And we\nwould like that everybody can read these things, maybe it will, we will have good conditions to\nbring to it.",
        "A: After I went with my parents into this military , and I am not sure if 1t was\nBergem-Bach (ph) or Magdeburg, but I think that 1t was Magdeburg and we had a very small\npiece and we were living there. It was a room divided and we had maybe, I don't know how\nmany meters, three meters, and we were living there. And once it happened that I was alone at\nhome and that I was cleaning the window, I was staying in the window, and one man came. I\nthought it was an SS man, it was Mr. Mumelstein (ph) and he came and he kick to the door and\nhe was shouting a little bit on me and looking not in very good way of me and I was, I had some\nminutes of, I was very afraid that he will throw me from the window, from the second floor\ndown. But, in one moment, he turned and he went and it was not very nice.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was by chance that I was at home because I was also working.",
        "A: No, besides with this counting in this Bolshevik (ph) when we stayed there a whole\nday, it was very bad. And every transport was a very, very bad experience for us because we\nhave to say farewell to people which were, who were for us very, very dear and we didn't know\nif we will see them and this was very hard. And we were afraid that everyday we will, we were\non the row and we will go. And we felt that it was not a good place where the SS go.",
        "A: [heard about it. I heard that somebody, when somebody wanted to fly, that they were hanging\nthere and they were shooting, yes. But I didn't see it. I saw only when somebody was shouting\nand so forth.",
        "A: Yes. Also, when it was finishing we had also a big epidemic of typhus. And they took us\nchildren to one sanatorium outside of Terezin. We were one month outside and they were\ntreating us and giving us meal and treating us from the medical side. And my mother and father\nhad to stay in Terezin and after we went back and after we went home.",
        "A: After liberation, yes. We went home in June, not in May.",
        "A: After liberation, but nobody could go out from Terezin because it was an epidemic.",
        "A: Yes, I remember. Because we had the SS, , and he gave us to eat and we\nhad to tell him, \" , \", \"again we have sardines\", and\nso it was like for , religious. And they built shops and caf\u00e9 houses and in these\nshops we got also tickets that we can shop all money, we had also money, that we can buy there,\nbut nothing was there, only I remember and some things like this, but we didn't,\nwe couldn't buy because nothing was there. It was only like for this , this\nvillages. And when the Red Cross came, then we had to clean everything and they chose also\nchildren, they looked well, they didn't, they were not too slim, and it was like a theater, like a\nspectacle. And we got a piece of bread and we were eating and like this. In film you can also see\nit.",
        "A: Yes, but we were happy to have a piece of bread!",
        "A: Yes, but we had to do it.",
        "A: I remember only that I was happy that we could leave. I was happy that my brother came to\nTerezin in the uniform of U.S. Army because when he flew from this, when they moved from the\nMalyy-Trostenetz concentration camp and when the war was ended, and he got, I don't know\nhow, to the U.S. Army because he was speaking very well English, he was helping, and he came\nto, with the U.S. Army to Czech country and then it was only possible, he came to look if we are\nalive. And I was the first, I saw him. And I was so happy! And after we got a letter from my\nsister, and it was also nice, and after we were looking forward to the time when we can leave.\nBut the people who went, who came back from other concentration camps were in such bad\nhealth that I never forget these people. How they came, because they were exhausted and I think\nafter some days they wouldn't want to be alive.",
        "A: One time it was possible, but we didn't have anybody to send us something.",
        "A: Nobody. I think it was so many people that it was not possible. And these Jewish\norganizations, they are also dying. Only when somebody was from, maybe a Christian woman\nand a Jewish father and children, maybe she, they were both in Prague or another town, and she\ncould send something. It was something, possible, but also we got a letter from my sister, we got\na letter to Terezin. But it was only a card, that she's alive. But nothing more.",
        "A: No, we had to give everything. And 1n this time, I think the small radios were not yet.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. We had to because people were speaking about it. I don't know how they could\nhave it, but I can tell you that when we were liberated, we were inside when the guns were\nworking, when we were liberated I, every time I was dreaming, how I was happy. How I will be\njumping when the liberation will be. I can tell you that I was so exhausted that I couldn't feel the\nreal happiness. After a long time, I could feel it. And my brother wrote a poem about it and it\nexpress also my feelings, also when we were in another place. Because I cannot translate it to\nyou. I am liberated with, 1t was asking, yes? Can I live as before? It was too much. I went\nthrough so many hard and difficult situations that it will take me a long time if I can be, I can feel\nthat I am liberated, I am a human being, I can live normal. It is inside me and it 1s like a stone,\nyes? And I could feel, I was a child, I was not yet 15, I was 14-years-old and I can tell you that I\ncouldn't be so happy. I was so exhausted from this waiting and waiting and seeing what\nhappened.",
        "A: By Russian army and English. The English were a little less, but English soldiers were there. I\ncan remember it.",
        "A: They came. First we were hidden. After, when it was, a little quiet we came out and they were\nsinging. We were thanking them and after we were looking what to do. What to have to eat.\nWhat to, because after this we had to take care about ourselves alone.",
        "A: Oh, they stayed. They stood, I think, the whole time. Because after I went towards the\nsanatorium, I cannot tell you everything because I was one months out from Terezin.",
        "A: Yes. It was, I cannot tell, it was some days, it was maybe 14 days after this liberation because\nit was this very dangerous typhus and it was not good, the children stay there, and after they had\npassed, and after, although my father organized his life after liberation, he took care about food\nand about helping people and also medical care started. Because it was necessary.",
        "A: A little bit, but we went with other children and it was first time we can get out! To anew\nlife, to a nice nature, it was something like paradise!",
        "A: Not too long, I think about in June, maybe also 14 days or so. I know that in June we got, we\ncame back to our town, to Berno (ph), and we had to start a new life. It was not so easy because\nwe didn't have money. Our fate was not free, and we got only 500 crowns and from U.S. Army,\nsaid, oh, we could go somewhere to eat something, but we couldn't eat\nbecause our stomachs were not use to eat too much and we had some difficulties. Now I started\nto look, what shall I study? And I forgot nearly everything from my knowing to play piano and I\nwanted to go to conservatory and I was looking for it to work very hard to again do exam. It\nlasted one year. I had to do exams from the normal school because I didn't have schools, yes?\nAnd I can tell you that in Terezin, we had so good professors. I had good marks, only I studied\nonly mathematics, math. And I got through. The life was hard, but I was so drinking the life that\nI was attending, for example, cinema. At four o'clock, six o'clock and eight o'clock! But I didn't\nknow what it was because there were three films, but I had to live. I wanted to live and funny\nthings I did, such un-normal things.",
        "A: My family had to go because my parents were a little bit older and not healthy. My father was\nwithout his right hand and we tried to start this normal life. But my brother left for America, he\ncouldn't study more, he had before war, before concentration camp and he couldn't\nleave and he went for America when it was possible. And my sister, second sister was living in\nIsrael and my second sister, this dancer, she was so ill after the war, she had tuberculosis, she\nwas in sanatorium. We couldn't leave it. I wanted to go to Israel but I couldn't do it because my\nparents were alone and they are not so strong and my sister was so ill. I started to study\nand stayed here.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We tried, but we found one floor near, lower. We found a flat, 1t was empty because they\nwere Germans. And we could go there. We could find our piano after many months. And we\ncould live in this flat, but we had to pay, furniture, not too much, but it was so hard for us. My\nfather had to borrow money from bank and had to start to a new life and he started to work and\nto build his shop again. But, when he gave back this money, it was three years, it lasted three\nyears. And when he gave back, after we started to live a little bit normal, Communists came to us\nand he had to close his shop. And it was very hard for him. But we had to live.",
        "A: Somebody was happy, somebody was not happy. I told you that some also, one mother of my\nschool mate, she told me, \"why did you return? Why didn't you stay there?\" And, \"this was not\nnormal girl\", and \"everybody was laughing about her\", and before war, I was the one, I was\nevery time telling, \"why you are laughing? She cannot, she is a poor girl\", and as to things we\nhad hidden by our neighbors, nearly everybody told us that they had bombs and they have\nnothing more. And we got only one small thing, one small statue from the house from my\nmother, it was remembering her house, and she was happy. But we didn't care about what we\nhave because it was not the important thing. The important thing was that we were free, that we\ncould live, we could work, and I could study. And we could take a little care about, to improve\nour health.",
        "A: I can tell you that I lost my religion in Terezin because I was praying for my friends and\nnothing happened. And I was quarreling with the God. And asking Him, \"why he is so cruel and\nhe let these things to work?\" No, He didn't answer me. For this reason, I only was feeling that I\nam a member of a group of people that had the same destiny, and I was proud of this big\ntradition, this old tradition. I was proud that I was a Jewish and I told everybody that I am\nJewish, but I didn't practice the religion. After, when my father died, I came a little bit back.",
        "A: What is this, resent?",
        "A: No, no, never. I only was doing things to telling people that never it can come again, and to",
        "A: I think it was a school of life, what got us through. And when we could live like this, we had\nto be strong. And we learned to live in bad conditions and try to be happy with small things. We,\nI think that it was a, so good school that, also, after the war, the life was not every time so easy.\nThat we could go through a little bit lighter than other people. Because we had harder times.\n[end of side one of Tape 2. ]",
        "A: Yes. We had a strong will. We wanted to leave and we were working very hard and we\nwanted to, what we couldn't do in the concentration camp, we wanted to do everything better and\nwe were very, very, very hard working. Because it was not so easy for us who didn't have\nschools, although when we read something, but it was not everything. And we had to run, to run\nvery quickly to do everything in time.",
        "A: Yes, yes, everything. Everything was nice for us and for everything to be thanked in our soul.",
        "A: Now, I don't understand.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I think we were, we developed our personality in another way if, when or if we\nlived a normal way. And everything was, every time I was comparing. Yes. Also, with my\nstudents, I told you that I was very strong and very serious. They had to work hard and they\nneeded to be honest and to be helpful and to be deeper, to be deep. Not only to do it, everything\nso. I think I was also, not only a professor of music, but I was like a mother or aunt, and I think\nthat they were also, they work and they laugh for this, what they did. They were a little bit\ndeeper. It was somebody or couldn't be deep, but mostly they were.",
        "A: Yes. It was the first time, we were living a little bit in the past, and we were trying not to live.\nIt was also, it needed to have strength. And not to feel that our body was weak and we had\ndifficulties. We wanted to work as nothing happened and we wanted to forget. And it, the cost\nwas of, many great strength and a great fear. But we did it. I could study, I had a degree. I did,\ntwice, conservatory. Not only once, I did as a pianist, after as a singer. After I did High School\nand I think I reached everything what a normal, grown, talented human being could reach.",
        "A: Yes, but it had to be and I think that, I was richer in this way, that I could have after. I could,\neverything, for everything be thankful and I was, I cannot say it, I could have a real friendship, a\ndeep friendship, and everything what I had, it was a little bit, it was everything more truthful.",
        "A: Sometimes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. They are, and also when we meet together with my friends who came back, we were\nspeaking about our life in concentration camp, but we don't like to speak about the bad things.\nWe were only speaking, not only sometimes, also, but we were, we are speaking about good\nthings, what we did, about the life there, about helping each other, about friendship, about these\ngirls who didn't come back and what we can do that they are not so forgotten. We will do that,\nwe will bring the book, we will write about it. I think many books are now here. The museum is\nfull of new books. I was there. But, I think that somebody who will read it, it is our duty to write\nit.",
        "A: Yes. I think. And the other images that, I have to do something that nothing will come back,\nthat these bad things, they will never come back. And also I can tell you, everything what I did, I\nwas doing, I tried to do good and well because I was a member of a nation who was, I cannot\ntell, haunted, yes? And that many gospels were about us and I wanted to show that I am a normal\nhuman being. That I can do good work, that I am a good, I was trying to me to be good, to do the\nright things. That nobody can say, \"Oh, look, this is a Jew and Jews are bad people\". And I was\nnot working for me, my and everything what I did, I did in, as I am delegate of all\nJews.",
        "A: A little bit, but not every time. Because things in the world are, not every time, good and\nright.",
        "A: No. Only I can say that I was visiting here in this museum that's, I can tell thank you for it. It\nis good, very good done. It is simple, it is human, it is not show. Every soul who is able to feel, I\nthink that everybody can have an impression of what happened and that I wish that everybody\nwho is through to see it, that will be in his life a good person and say, don't alive these persons,\nallow, that don't allow these things to be repeated.\n"
