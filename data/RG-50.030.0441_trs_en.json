        "A: In August, 1914, when the war started and the Russian occupied the Bukovina, my mother fled\nwith many other people from Czernowitz to Vienna, so my first four years which I remember are\nfrom Vienna. We were two children, the father was on the front in Italy. He came once in a while\nto visit, maybe three or four times during the war.",
        "Q: And after the war, what happened to your family?",
        "A: In June, in July, 1918, we came back to Czernowitz and my father who got wounded in the war\nleft, lived for year and half more and then he died. And now we stayed with our mother and four\nchildren at that time, two were born during the war and after the war.",
        "Q: Where, where did you go to school?",
        "A: I went to school, primary school in Czernowitz. These were still in German though it was\nalready next to Romania. Then I went to high school in Czernowitz and then in 1929, then I stayed\nfor two years at University of Czernowitz. Starting with mathematics(ph), 1931, I went to\nBerno(ph), to study engineering but one year later, I came to Bucharest to the polytechnic school.\nAnd here where I graduated in construction, civil engineering in 1935. 1936, I did army service\nfrom 1937 through 1940, I stayed in Bucharest and sometimes in the provinces and worked in\nengineering.",
        "Q: When did you, did you return to Czernowitz?",
        "A: I returned to Czernowitz at the end of June 1940 when the Russians occupied Czernowitz, first\nin order to be with my family, and secondly because at that time an anti-Semitic government was\ninstalled in Bucharest.",
        "Q: Can you go back for one moment to the inter-war period and tell us if you witnessed any,\nwitnessed any instances of anti-Semitism in Romania?",
        "A: Before I came in contact with the Romanians, I didn\u2019t know anything about anti-Semitism. Say\naround the age of ten or 12, there was a Congress of, Congress of Romanian students in Czernowitz\nand they went around town and sang their, their chants about long live Romania, death to the Jews.\nThey took off the, there was a municipal theater, they took off the sign which was now\nonly for Romanian place. One year later or two years later, there was after the education was taken\nover by the Romanian government and the students didn\u2019t know enough Romanian, most of them\nfailed at the matriculation exam called baccalaureate and some, one protested very heavily. It was\nshot down by a Romanian student. The student, after a trial was acquitted. This way, I got to learn\nabout Romanian anti-Semitism.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the summer of 1940 when the Soviets, soldier troops occupied Bukovina. Go\nahead, yeah.",
        "A: I would like to continue.",
        "Q: Yeah, please go ahead.",
        "A: Then when I was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, there were a number of students\nwere anti-Semitic but the engineering atmosphere prevailed and were, we were treated more or less\nequally. But at the end of our studies, we didn\u2019t have the same opportunities like the Romanian\ngraduates. The Romanian graduates had open fields, we could take only second-hand positions.\nThis was still much better than for other professions. From the probably early thirties, no Jew could\nget a job as a teacher in public schools, only in private schools. And no Jew was ever admitted to be\na civil service employee. Same thing in the Army. 1936, when I was in the Army, in just an eight\nmonths course for engineers, the, none of the Jews were, was admitted to the exam to become\nofficer in the Reserve of the Romania Army. So. And we had to serve a few months longer. In my,\nin 1937, at the end of 1937, when I was employed 1n a private engineering firm, the the\ngovernment, the embassy made(ph) the government came to power, Kovan Kuza(ph) and our\ncompany gave us every months by the end of the month a note that this is our last month of work\nand say on January 1, \u201938 I got a note that, that my employment will end January 31\u201c, \u00b038.\nFebruary 1\u00b0, I got another note through January, February 28\" and so forth. Then Koga Koola(ph)\nlived, Koga Kooza(ph) fell and we continued to work a second great, second great engineers,\nalways, always just with smaller, smaller pay and less rights than the other, the other engineers.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you want to add on this subject anything else or we can go to the year 1940?",
        "A: Let\u2019s go to the year 1940.",
        "Q: Okay, so my question is, what did you witness in terms of Soviet occupation of Bukovina from\nJuly 1940, until June 1941. Where during this period of time, during this 11 months, any special\npolicies against the Jews enacted? Were the Jews deported or not?",
        "A: During this year, it\u2019s a full year, not 11 months, it was, it started end of June, end of June 1940.\nWar broke out June 22\u2122, 1941 and probably early July, the Russians left and the Romanians came\nback. During this months, during this year, I wouldn\u2019t say there were any anti-Semitic acts taken by\nthe Soviet government. There were acts rather taken against people who, people who, owners,\nowners of industrial plants, owners of commercial .. .",
        "Q: Establishments.",
        "A: Establishments. And so forth. Because some or most of that, some of them, because the\nGermans and the Romanians had left, so most of these owners who stayed were Jews. And quite a\nnumber of them were sent to Siberia. Quite a number of them were sent, this was already in June of\n1941, a few weeks before the war broke out.",
        "Q: Did you witness such a deportation?",
        "A: I witnessed such a deportation because I witnessed first when I came in the morning to the\noffice, I was told what happened. Then I had to go a school for some construction work and the girl\ncame and said, \u201cGoodbye children,\u201d policemen, Russian policemen next to her. She said,\n\u201cChildren, these men came to pick me up, my parents are at the railway station. I have to go with\nthem.\u201d And I had a job next to the railway station and I came and saw these people in the trains on\ntheir way to Siberia.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s move to 22\" of June, 1941. Could describe to us what the beginning of the war\nmeant for you and your family and how was Jewish life in Czernowitz during the first days of the\nwar?",
        "A: Okay, so, June 22\". We woke up and on the radio we heard Hitler\u2019s voice. Two hundred\nRussian divisions are on border, we have to defend ourselves and have to go into the, the Soviet\nUnion. There were like probably eight or ten days of waiting period and then the Russians left.\nQuite a number of Jews left with them. I would estimate this as between eight and ten thousand.",
        "Q: From a population of?",
        "A: Of, of Jewish population of 60 thousand, approximately. I was tempted to go as well. Quite a\nnumber of my friends went, but we were treated badly by the Russian leaders. Say, the, when we\nstayed at the office in the last day, they gave authorizations to, authorizations of evacuations to all\nthe Russians who came from the Soviet Union but wouldn\u2019t give any to us. So I was afraid, at not\nmyself just with some friends, that we would go and they wouldn\u2019t even let us in. We were afraid\nof the Germans coming here, here as, as occupiers but plus, at that time, I was already in love with\nLotte. She said, she said, \u201cI never would leave my family, either.\u201d\u201d And so we stayed and waited for\na few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into Czernowitz.",
        "Q: What happened when the Romanians and the Germans entered Czernowitz? What happened to\nthe Jews?",
        "A: Okay. This is just on hearsay. A few were, a few hundred, maybe a thousand or more were\nmurdered in the first few days. I know about worked, worked with me. And the chief\nrabbi, Dr. Mark(ph) and then they started taking us to manual labor, cleaning, then for some\nconstruction jobs but say, they came into the houses and took us. Then...",
        "Q: Who, who came into the houses? Romanians or Germans?",
        "A: Romanian soldiers. No Germans, I think, were ever involved in any administration of any\nmeasures in Czernowitz at that time.",
        "Q: Can I ask you another question?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember when and if a yellow star or another type of sign was introduced for the\nJews?",
        "A: I would say a few weeks, maybe only two weeks later. We were obliged to put on a yellow star.\nI remember exactly the day, when for the first time we came out into the street with yellow star.\nTwo reactions remain in my memory. One reaction was a Romanian priest who passed us on the\nstreet, took off his hat. Another reaction was when the wife of a Romanian janitor who said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s very good that this happens to you.\u201d",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: Okay, next, it was very tough with, because, at this time there was no, not, not enough food.\nThere was many other, there was no electricity, so we had to go and buy food and buy, buy\nkerosene. And you couldn\u2019t get kerosene and food with the star. So we stayed and we ___ took\noff the stars and stayed in line and took kerosene. Few days later, a young student, military student,\nwe had at that time I think this was a still high school for military high school, say in, in preparation\nfor officer school. So a student of this school recognized me a day or two later that I didn\u2019t have the\nstar and he saw me with the star and took me to work in the, in the field. With other like 40 or 50\nJews. So we worked all day and in front of all of these, he, he picked me . Now, this\ndidn\u2019t go on for long. Because sometime, say mid-August, okay, I tried to get a permanent work so\nI wouldn\u2019t be taken to ...",
        "Q: Forced labor.",
        "A: Forced labor. And I went to the railway station because a few years earlier, I was there as a\nstudent. We had to go every summer for practice and one of the summers, for two months, I\nworked in the railway station in what is called the maintenance section which maintained the track\nand the bridges and the, and the buildings. And the head of this section was the, at my time, he was\nthe assistant head. So he recognized me and he talked this over with the, his chief which was the\ninspector for that bridges and track and they took me to work. Though at that time I got paid only\nthe pay of a soldier and from then on and through this employment, I, I was not harassed again with\nforced labor.",
        "Q: Okay, can you describe where did you live, how was housing? If you could take your time and\ndescribe for us the process of ghettoization(ph) in Czernowitz?",
        "A: Yeah. Okay. Now at that time, yeah, so let, yeah. Two of us, my brother who was a student at\nthe Polytechnic in Bucharest, we, he has not finished at that time, and myself, we came back when\nthe, with the Russia occupation. My mother and my two sisters, they had quite a good apartment\nand we stayed all four of us together under, under the Soviet Occupation and continued then under\nthe Romanians. Lotte, with her family, stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there\nquite often and though as I said, in the beginning, we had problems with food, but because in the\nBukovina, like in all of Romania, food was plenty and then we got to barter different things from\nhouse. We bartered with the peasants and we got at that time food enough. Now, this is only say\none more month because in October at that time, the ghetto started.",
        "Q: So what happened to you and your family?",
        "A: At the ghetto?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So on October 11\", this was on the Sabbath Day, one morning, maybe the, the work was from\neight to one and from four to seven at that time.",
        "Q: What was, what was [talkover]",
        "A: I worked for the railway.",
        "Q: OhI see, yeah I see.",
        "A: So before eight o\u2019clock, I just ran across the street to say hello to Lotte and a neighbor of hers\ntold me, \u201cMr. Engineer, would you read this to us?\u201d The elderly people, elderly people miss our\nparents, didn\u2019t still know no Romanian at that time. I read to her, it said, \u201cThere will be punished\nwith death everybody who will house Jews, who will give shelter to people not, not entitled to and\nthose who will help flee people away.\u201d So I said to her, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. This has no relation to\nus. We don\u2019t want to flee and we don\u2019t want to give shelter,\u201d and I read to her. One o\u2019clock I came\nhome for lunch and I saw already people on the street with backpacks. Say what happened? We\nhave to go into a ghetto. So I came home and we packed. My family, they were already packed but\nwe didn\u2019t ever to go. So I went across the street to Lotte and she said, \u201cWe go to a cousin of mine\nwho 1s in the street, in a street which belongs to the, lives in the street which belongs to the ghetto,\u201d\nso we went. And then, there were 11 of us and my mother and her four, four children, Lotte and her\nsister and their parents and the fiancee of the sister, mother. We all went to this cousin of Lotte\u2019s\nwho lived not far from this place and we slept on the, the floor for a few days. Six o\u2019clock in the\nevening, they, a barricade was, was built and we couldn\u2019t get back, get out of the, of the ghetto.\nNext two days, there was just met on the street and discussed what is going to happen we\u2019s, we\nwere supposed to be into Transnistria, which is a province east of Bessarabia, which\nGermany gave to the Romanians for . On, on October 14, we were told that these\nthree, few streets including ours should pack and go to the railway station. So we put all our\nbelongings on a peasant cart. The peasants came to make some money and we waited on the street\nto go to the railway station to the trains, bringing us Transnistria. In the meantime, while staying\nthere, the people started talking that some number will stay, will not go. And said, one lady said,\n\u201cYou know, engineers should stay.\u201d So a Romanian major passed by and I said, \u201cMr. Major, I\n, Should I stay or go?\u201d He said, \u201cStay.\u201d So I took with Lotte this cart which had all the\nbelongings of the 11 of us and we took it out of the streets leading to the railway station into a part\nof the ghetto we were supposed to leave the next days. We had to bribe a soldier because he was\nsupposed, we were not supposed to go, go there and there we stayed on the floor, all of us, one night\nonly. Next, that evening, Parryom Poppovitch(ph) came to the Jewish Hospital which was the seat\nof the Jewish community or say the council, Jewish council, we could the\ncommunity and said, \u201cI have with you, I have for you good news,\u201d he said. Because he talked to\nthem in Germany, news was called paseera(ph) he said, \u201cPaseera(ph) which is good news. You will\nstay.\u201d And the day after, they opened a few more streets for the ghetto and we got into a very good\nhouse belonging to uncle of Lotte\u2019s where we stayed for the next, \u2018til the end of the ghetto. But,\nokay, sol said...",
        "Q: For how long did you stay in that house?",
        "A: For almost, okay, so next day this good news from Parryom Poppovitch(ph) were not that good\nany more because we were told lists will be arranged by professions and then they will decide who\nstays, who goes. So, on this day, I said to Lotte, \u201cEither we stay or we go, let us get married.\u201d This\nwas already the Friday after the Sabbath Day when the ghetto started. And I saw across the street\nfrom this house where said, \u201cRabbi, we would like to get married.\u201d He said, \u201cToo\nlate.\u201d It was Friday, two o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: So the rabbi said it\u2019s too late.",
        "A: Yeah. So next morning, we went to the commander of the ghetto who was a major of the\nRomanian army. The army was the supervised, this matter and said, \u201cMr. Major, we\nwould like to get married.\u201d So he gave us a soldier, an escort and we went in the morning to the\ncourt because it would, the court had to give us a dispensation so we could get married without two\nweeks waiting. Then we went back in the afternoon, we went to City Hall. City was supposed to,\nthey opened at five o\u2019clock in the evening. five o\u2019clock in the evening, so we took this\nsoldier four o\u2019clock and I went first to the railway administration and they told us don\u2019t worry, we\nhave given, we have given the government all the names of our Jewish employees, you will stay.\nThen I went to our other place where my, where my brother worked and this lady took his name, all\nthe personal data, said, \u201cI will help him.\u201d Then five o\u2019clock we were married. The, all the\nemployees in this registration office were very gentle. Either by themselves or the mayor was\nParryom Poppovitch(ph) but the registrar who was a university professor, he told me, \u201cMr.\nEngineer,\u201d before the procedure, \u201cMr. Engineer, I hope to celebrate for you Jews many\nmore happy, many more happy occasions also here in Romania.\u201d And then we went back home,\nthey already, each took out of his backpack whatever, and this was our,\nour marriage ceremony. And we didn\u2019t get, go on the honeymoon to Transnistria. Two days later I\ngot two authorizations to stay, one on the list of the civil engineers, 27 engineers say,\ntook a number and then I got it from the, as a railway engineer. And my brother was a mining\nso he got it too. Two days later, we went home. I think approximately 12 days after\nwe left.",
        "Q: Let me, let me ask you if you witnessed, witnessed any scene of deportation of other people.",
        "A: I was in the railway station and saw them going to the trains.",
        "Q: What did you see?",
        "A: I would say that I didn\u2019t see anybody being beaten. Everything was orderly. They went with\ntheir backpacks to the trains and went on the train. There was no, this was already November 1941.\nIn January *41, they had these little squalor, or how you call it in, in Bucharest.",
        "Q: Uprising.",
        "A: Uprising. Here...[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]...there was no brutality. Everybody went with his\nbackpack quietly to the trains. I was told later when they came back, that they were chased across\nthe , with, with brutality. But I didn\u2019t witness, I, I witnessed only quiet, their quiet way\ninto the, boarding the trains. Saw it, I saw it from the window of my offices. I would like\ntoend...",
        "Q: Yah.",
        "A: Because I already said this about the gentleness in the office of the registrar in, in the city hall.\nThat during my, the following two and a half years, during my work in this railway office, I\nencountered only gentleness. Some they have been anti-Semites, they were happy that\nthe Jews were not . The assistant head of the section kissed me when I came back to\nwork and a German, a German who worked with , he treated me with\nfull sympathy and all the others as well.",
        "Q: Tell me, please, what happened, how was the life in, in Czernowitz between the fall of 1941 and\n1942, during the spring of 1942, summer of 1942? What else happened?",
        "A: Again, what I will say, yah, in the meantime, many business people, Romanian business people\nwho left Czernowitz when the Russians came in plus other business people from Romania came in\nand opened the, their previous businesses. Plus, they were given the businesses of the Jews and the\nbusiness of the Germans. During the Russian Occupation, the Germans emigrated to Germany.\nThere was, this was an agreement between the Soviet and the German government. So there was a\nlot of business to be had in, in Czernowitz and many people from Romania came. If they needed,\nthey needed and these were the so they took them into and they, they may\nnot have paid them very well but they were very happy to have people to carry on their business.\nSo, somehow, a rule of law was back and you had to wear the star. And we had the curfew at eight\no\u2019clock in the evening. But we\u2019re very young and we had friends and we met Sunday for be playing\nbridge or in order to, not to be on the street at eight o\u2019clock, we slept with our friends or they came\nto sleep with us and we partied and lived there quietly. With fear, with fear because there was, we\nknew there is a still long way to go.",
        "Q: Let me ask you another question. Did you witness the deportations from Czernowitz from 1942,\nfrom June 1942 and if you witnessed something, what exactly you witnessed?",
        "A: Okay. In, in June 1942, on three consecutives Sunday mornings in number two or\nthree thousand Jews Czernowitz, were taken again into Transnistria. These were mainly the people\nwho didn\u2019t have government authorizations, who had had authorizations only from Parryom\nPoppovitch(ph). Plus, other people who were politically suspect. For instance, a cousin of Lotte\u2019s,\na doctor, who had, who was a director of a hospital and other people who were not considered\nreliable. Leaning, left leaning, or if an engineer who, like me, had come from Romania to\nCzernowitz to the Russians. But he was, he was with the railways, say 50 kilometers south from,\nfrom Czernowitz and he left his employment and came to Czernowitz. And the police found out\nand they took him so these people were deported in June of \u201942. We, in the first night, the bell ring,\nso I went to the door, open the door and here two soldiers, policemen, policemen asked\nme, \u201cAre you Kahanni(ph)?\u201d Says, \u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cKahanni(ph) lives here next door.\u201d So this lady\nKahanni(ph) had a Polish authorization, she knew somebody was coming and went into hiding. But\nearly morning, we from our windows, people being assembled in the streets on their\nway to these . This was the that they stayed throughout Sunday, some of\nthem at that time were released. The leaders of the Jewish community came over there with the\nagents of the government and with some some discussions, a few were taken back but\nfor the few who were, who, who came home, other people were taken. There was a quota which\nhad to be like 20 or 35 , | don\u2019t exactly. And the third Sunday, too many people were\nreleased and in the evening, they didn\u2019t have the number and they went into, to streets and without\nany...",
        "Q: Warning...",
        "A: Warning, they took all of the Jews from these two streets. And this is the deportations\nand there were two years of, of relatively quiet life. People went to work and by 1943,\nmid 1943, the yellow star was taken off.",
        "Q: Do you know why? Or you can you, can you [talkover] comment on this?",
        "A: I will comment on this that in the meantime the Romanians found out that the Germans will lose\nthe war and they had to play along and, but they needed, they needed some, anybody, that they were\nnot fool on the side of the Germans. Basis what, what I suggest. Now, similarly, similarly, when\ntwo months after I came back, so, when I came back to work in 1941, say in early November, by\nmid-December, the, Bucharest gave the order to give us food . Started from the day,\nAugust, when I started to work. [talkover]",
        "Q: So, which, which year was this?",
        "A: \u201941. So by, by December \u00b041, I got paid for four months which was quite a, amount of money.\nCome \u00b042, they said, \u201cYou got, get paid for nine months, three months you are a soldier.\u201d So they\ngave us pay for nine months, three months I had to work without money. \u00b043, we were already\nassimilated to the Romanian truce and there was only one month without pay.",
        "Q: I understand. Can you, can you describe for us what the ration meant for you and when\n\u2014?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So.",
        "A: Now, we all witnessed we were not allowed to listen to radio news but we had\nneighbors who listened or we went to neighbors who listen so we already knew that the Russians\ncome closer and closer. And in March they were already, say, not far in former Poland, say like\nhundred or 200 kilometers from German . Now by say, after mid-March, say maybe\nthis was already 20\" of March, the Romanian left and there were a few days of an interim(ph). In\nthese days, no more Romanians there but few German, probably German SS or so.\nAnd Lotte\u2019s sister, she went across the street and was taken by these Germans into a place where\nshe was interrogated. And then the Germans brought us to that house and there was most elderly\npeople, I was the only youngster and they came to me with, with, with\ndown here next to me. Do! Give me your watch. So I gave the watch and then he took\nthe other watches and they left. Next day the Russians were here so these watches fell into the hand\nof the Russians because the same thing continued the next few days with the Russians. When the\n, \u2018Give me your watch.\u201d",
        "Q: Let me, let me ask you another question. Did you witness the return of the Jewish deportees\nfrom Transnistria to Chernowitz?(ph)",
        "A: What we first witnessed was a few Polish Jews who came right after the, the Russian Army,\nSoviet Army. And here for the first time we heard about a real Holocaust. We knew that say, that\nbrutal things happened. But we didn\u2019t have any details about what was happening. Embarrassingly\nenough, do you know a name, a man by the name of Fred Bernard(ph)?",
        "Q: No.",

        "A: In a suburb, Mulezootshka(ph), next to this town of Czernowitz in the province Bukovina of the\nAustria-Hungarian empire at that time.",
        "A: In August, 1914, when the war started and the Russian occupied the Bukovina, my mother fled\nwith many other people from Czernowitz to Vienna, so my first four years which I remember are\nfrom Vienna. We were two children, the father was on the front in Italy. He came once in a while\nto visit, maybe three or four times during the war.",
        "A: In June, in July, 1918, we came back to Czernowitz and my father who got wounded in the war\nleft, lived for year and half more and then he died. And now we stayed with our mother and four\nchildren at that time, two were born during the war and after the war.",
        "A: I went to school, primary school in Czernowitz. These were still in German though it was\nalready next to Romania. Then I went to high school in Czernowitz and then in 1929, then I stayed\nfor two years at University of Czernowitz. Starting with mathematics(ph), 1931, I went to\nBerno(ph), to study engineering but one year later, I came to Bucharest to the polytechnic school.\nAnd here where I graduated in construction, civil engineering in 1935. 1936, I did army service\nfrom 1937 through 1940, I stayed in Bucharest and sometimes in the provinces and worked in\nengineering.",
        "A: I returned to Czernowitz at the end of June 1940 when the Russians occupied Czernowitz, first\nin order to be with my family, and secondly because at that time an anti-Semitic government was\ninstalled in Bucharest.",
        "A: Before I came in contact with the Romanians, I didn\u2019t know anything about anti-Semitism. Say\naround the age of ten or 12, there was a Congress of, Congress of Romanian students in Czernowitz\nand they went around town and sang their, their chants about long live Romania, death to the Jews.\nThey took off the, there was a municipal theater, they took off the sign which was now\nonly for Romanian place. One year later or two years later, there was after the education was taken\nover by the Romanian government and the students didn\u2019t know enough Romanian, most of them\nfailed at the matriculation exam called baccalaureate and some, one protested very heavily. It was\nshot down by a Romanian student. The student, after a trial was acquitted. This way, I got to learn\nabout Romanian anti-Semitism.",
        "A: I would like to continue.",
        "A: Then when I was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, there were a number of students\nwere anti-Semitic but the engineering atmosphere prevailed and were, we were treated more or less\nequally. But at the end of our studies, we didn\u2019t have the same opportunities like the Romanian\ngraduates. The Romanian graduates had open fields, we could take only second-hand positions.\nThis was still much better than for other professions. From the probably early thirties, no Jew could\nget a job as a teacher in public schools, only in private schools. And no Jew was ever admitted to be\na civil service employee. Same thing in the Army. 1936, when I was in the Army, in just an eight\nmonths course for engineers, the, none of the Jews were, was admitted to the exam to become\nofficer in the Reserve of the Romania Army. So. And we had to serve a few months longer. In my,\nin 1937, at the end of 1937, when I was employed 1n a private engineering firm, the the\ngovernment, the embassy made(ph) the government came to power, Kovan Kuza(ph) and our\ncompany gave us every months by the end of the month a note that this is our last month of work\nand say on January 1, \u201938 I got a note that, that my employment will end January 31\u201c, \u00b038.\nFebruary 1\u00b0, I got another note through January, February 28\" and so forth. Then Koga Koola(ph)\nlived, Koga Kooza(ph) fell and we continued to work a second great, second great engineers,\nalways, always just with smaller, smaller pay and less rights than the other, the other engineers.",
        "A: Let\u2019s go to the year 1940.",
        "A: During this year, it\u2019s a full year, not 11 months, it was, it started end of June, end of June 1940.\nWar broke out June 22\u2122, 1941 and probably early July, the Russians left and the Romanians came\nback. During this months, during this year, I wouldn\u2019t say there were any anti-Semitic acts taken by\nthe Soviet government. There were acts rather taken against people who, people who, owners,\nowners of industrial plants, owners of commercial .. .",
        "A: Establishments. And so forth. Because some or most of that, some of them, because the\nGermans and the Romanians had left, so most of these owners who stayed were Jews. And quite a\nnumber of them were sent to Siberia. Quite a number of them were sent, this was already in June of\n1941, a few weeks before the war broke out.",
        "A: I witnessed such a deportation because I witnessed first when I came in the morning to the\noffice, I was told what happened. Then I had to go a school for some construction work and the girl\ncame and said, \u201cGoodbye children,\u201d policemen, Russian policemen next to her. She said,\n\u201cChildren, these men came to pick me up, my parents are at the railway station. I have to go with\nthem.\u201d And I had a job next to the railway station and I came and saw these people in the trains on\ntheir way to Siberia.",
        "A: Okay, so, June 22\". We woke up and on the radio we heard Hitler\u2019s voice. Two hundred\nRussian divisions are on border, we have to defend ourselves and have to go into the, the Soviet\nUnion. There were like probably eight or ten days of waiting period and then the Russians left.\nQuite a number of Jews left with them. I would estimate this as between eight and ten thousand.",
        "A: Of, of Jewish population of 60 thousand, approximately. I was tempted to go as well. Quite a\nnumber of my friends went, but we were treated badly by the Russian leaders. Say, the, when we\nstayed at the office in the last day, they gave authorizations to, authorizations of evacuations to all\nthe Russians who came from the Soviet Union but wouldn\u2019t give any to us. So I was afraid, at not\nmyself just with some friends, that we would go and they wouldn\u2019t even let us in. We were afraid\nof the Germans coming here, here as, as occupiers but plus, at that time, I was already in love with\nLotte. She said, she said, \u201cI never would leave my family, either.\u201d\u201d And so we stayed and waited for\na few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into Czernowitz.",

And the chief\nrabbi, Dr. Mark(ph) and then they started taking us to manual labor, cleaning, then for some\nconstruction jobs but say, they came into the houses and took us. Then...",
        "A: Romanian soldiers. No Germans, I think, were ever involved in any administration of any\nmeasures in Czernowitz at that time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I would say a few weeks, maybe only two weeks later. We were obliged to put on a yellow star.\nI remember exactly the day, when for the first time we came out into the street with yellow star.\nTwo reactions remain in my memory. One reaction was a Romanian priest who passed us on the\nstreet, took off his hat. Another reaction was when the wife of a Romanian janitor who said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s very good that this happens to you.\u201d",
        "A: Okay, next, it was very tough with, because, at this time there was no, not, not enough food.\nThere was many other, there was no electricity, so we had to go and buy food and buy, buy\nkerosene. And you couldn\u2019t get kerosene and food with the star. So we stayed and we ___ took\noff the stars and stayed in line and took kerosene. Few days later, a young student, military student,\nwe had at that time I think this was a still high school for military high school, say in, in preparation\nfor officer school. So a student of this school recognized me a day or two later that I didn\u2019t have the\nstar and he saw me with the star and took me to work in the, in the field. With other like 40 or 50\nJews. So we worked all day and in front of all of these, he, he picked me . Now, this\ndidn\u2019t go on for long. Because sometime, say mid-August, okay, I tried to get a permanent work so\nI wouldn\u2019t be taken to ...",
        "A: Forced labor. And I went to the railway station because a few years earlier, I was there as a\nstudent. We had to go every summer for practice and one of the summers, for two months, I\nworked in the railway station in what is called the maintenance section which maintained the track\nand the bridges and the, and the buildings. And the head of this section was the, at my time, he was\nthe assistant head. So he recognized me and he talked this over with the, his chief which was the\ninspector for that bridges and track and they took me to work. Though at that time I got paid only\nthe pay of a soldier and from then on and through this employment, I, I was not harassed again with\nforced labor.",
        "A: Yeah. Okay. Now at that time, yeah, so let, yeah. Two of us, my brother who was a student at\nthe Polytechnic in Bucharest, we, he has not finished at that time, and myself, we came back when\nthe, with the Russia occupation. My mother and my two sisters, they had quite a good apartment\nand we stayed all four of us together under, under the Soviet Occupation and continued then under\nthe Romanians. Lotte, with her family, stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there\nquite often and though as I said, in the beginning, we had problems with food, but because in the\nBukovina, like in all of Romania, food was plenty and then we got to barter different things from\nhouse. We bartered with the peasants and we got at that time food enough. Now, this is only say\none more month because in October at that time, the ghetto started.",
        "A: At the ghetto?",
        "A: So on October 11\", this was on the Sabbath Day, one morning, maybe the, the work was from\neight to one and from four to seven at that time.",
        "A: I worked for the railway.",
        "A: So before eight o\u2019clock, I just ran across the street to say hello to Lotte and a neighbor of hers\ntold me, \u201cMr. Engineer, would you read this to us?\u201d The elderly people, elderly people miss our\nparents, didn\u2019t still know no Romanian at that time. I read to her, it said, \u201cThere will be punished\nwith death everybody who will house Jews, who will give shelter to people not, not entitled to and\nthose who will help flee people away.\u201d So I said to her, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. This has no relation to\nus. We don\u2019t want to flee and we don\u2019t want to give shelter,\u201d and I read to her. One o\u2019clock I came\nhome for lunch and I saw already people on the street with backpacks. Say what happened? We\nhave to go into a ghetto. So I came home and we packed. My family, they were already packed but\nwe didn\u2019t ever to go. So I went across the street to Lotte and she said, \u201cWe go to a cousin of mine\nwho 1s in the street, in a street which belongs to the, lives in the street which belongs to the ghetto,\u201d\nso we went. And then, there were 11 of us and my mother and her four, four children, Lotte and her\nsister and their parents and the fiancee of the sister, mother. We all went to this cousin of Lotte\u2019s\nwho lived not far from this place and we slept on the, the floor for a few days. Six o\u2019clock in the\nevening, they, a barricade was, was built and we couldn\u2019t get back, get out of the, of the ghetto.\nNext two days, there was just met on the street and discussed what is going to happen we\u2019s, we\nwere supposed to be into Transnistria, which is a province east of Bessarabia, which\nGermany gave to the Romanians for . On, on October 14, we were told that these\nthree, few streets including ours should pack and go to the railway station. So we put all our\nbelongings on a peasant cart. The peasants came to make some money and we waited on the street\nto go to the railway station to the trains, bringing us Transnistria. In the meantime, while staying\nthere, the people started talking that some number will stay, will not go. And said, one lady said,\n\u201cYou know, engineers should stay.\u201d So a Romanian major passed by and I said, \u201cMr. Major, I\n, Should I stay or go?\u201d He said, \u201cStay.\u201d So I took with Lotte this cart which had all the\nbelongings of the 11 of us and we took it out of the streets leading to the railway station into a part\nof the ghetto we were supposed to leave the next days. We had to bribe a soldier because he was\nsupposed, we were not supposed to go, go there and there we stayed on the floor, all of us, one night\nonly. Next, that evening, Parryom Poppovitch(ph) came to the Jewish Hospital which was the seat\nof the Jewish community or say the council, Jewish council, we could the\ncommunity and said, \u201cI have with you, I have for you good news,\u201d he said. Because he talked to\nthem in Germany, news was called paseera(ph) he said, \u201cPaseera(ph) which is good news. You will\nstay.\u201d And the day after, they opened a few more streets for the ghetto and we got into a very good\nhouse belonging to uncle of Lotte\u2019s where we stayed for the next, \u2018til the end of the ghetto. But,\nokay, sol said...",
        "A: For almost, okay, so next day this good news from Parryom Poppovitch(ph) were not that good\nany more because we were told lists will be arranged by professions and then they will decide who\nstays, who goes. So, on this day, I said to Lotte, \u201cEither we stay or we go, let us get married.\u201d This\nwas already the Friday after the Sabbath Day when the ghetto started. And I saw across the street\nfrom this house where said, \u201cRabbi, we would like to get married.\u201d He said, \u201cToo\nlate.\u201d It was Friday, two o\u2019clock.",
        "A: Yeah. So next morning, we went to the commander of the ghetto who was a major of the\nRomanian army. The army was the supervised, this matter and said, \u201cMr. Major, we\nwould like to get married.\u201d So he gave us a soldier, an escort and we went in the morning to the\ncourt because it would, the court had to give us a dispensation so we could get married without two\nweeks waiting. Then we went back in the afternoon, we went to City Hall. City was supposed to,\nthey opened at five o\u2019clock in the evening. five o\u2019clock in the evening, so we took this\nsoldier four o\u2019clock and I went first to the railway administration and they told us don\u2019t worry, we\nhave given, we have given the government all the names of our Jewish employees, you will stay.\nThen I went to our other place where my, where my brother worked and this lady took his name, all\nthe personal data, said, \u201cI will help him.\u201d Then five o\u2019clock we were married. The, all the\nemployees in this registration office were very gentle. Either by themselves or the mayor was\nParryom Poppovitch(ph) but the registrar who was a university professor, he told me, \u201cMr.\nEngineer,\u201d before the procedure, \u201cMr. Engineer, I hope to celebrate for you Jews many\nmore happy, many more happy occasions also here in Romania.\u201d And then we went back home,\nthey already, each took out of his backpack whatever, and this was our,\nour marriage ceremony. And we didn\u2019t get, go on the honeymoon to Transnistria. Two days later I\ngot two authorizations to stay, one on the list of the civil engineers, 27 engineers say,\ntook a number and then I got it from the, as a railway engineer. And my brother was a mining\nso he got it too. Two days later, we went home. I think approximately 12 days after\nwe left.",
        "A: I was in the railway station and saw them going to the trains.",
        "A: I would say that I didn\u2019t see anybody being beaten. Everything was orderly. They went with\ntheir backpacks to the trains and went on the train. There was no, this was already November 1941.\nIn January *41, they had these little squalor, or how you call it in, in Bucharest.",
        "A: Uprising. Here...[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]...there was no brutality. Everybody went with his\nbackpack quietly to the trains. I was told later when they came back, that they were chased across\nthe , with, with brutality. But I didn\u2019t witness, I, I witnessed only quiet, their quiet way\ninto the, boarding the trains. Saw it, I saw it from the window of my offices. I would like\ntoend...",
        "A: Because I already said this about the gentleness in the office of the registrar in, in the city hall.\nThat during my, the following two and a half years, during my work in this railway office, I\nencountered only gentleness. Some they have been anti-Semites, they were happy that\nthe Jews were not . The assistant head of the section kissed me when I came back to\nwork and a German, a German who worked with , he treated me with\nfull sympathy and all the others as well.",
        "A: Again, what I will say, yah, in the meantime, many business people, Romanian business people\nwho left Czernowitz when the Russians came in plus other business people from Romania came in\nand opened the, their previous businesses. Plus, they were given the businesses of the Jews and the\nbusiness of the Germans. During the Russian Occupation, the Germans emigrated to Germany.\nThere was, this was an agreement between the Soviet and the German government. So there was a\nlot of business to be had in, in Czernowitz and many people from Romania came. If they needed,\nthey needed and these were the so they took them into and they, they may\nnot have paid them very well but they were very happy to have people to carry on their business.\nSo, somehow, a rule of law was back and you had to wear the star. And we had the curfew at eight\no\u2019clock in the evening. But we\u2019re very young and we had friends and we met Sunday for be playing\nbridge or in order to, not to be on the street at eight o\u2019clock, we slept with our friends or they came\nto sleep with us and we partied and lived there quietly. With fear, with fear because there was, we\nknew there is a still long way to go.",
        "A: Okay. In, in June 1942, on three consecutives Sunday mornings in number two or\nthree thousand Jews Czernowitz, were taken again into Transnistria. These were mainly the people\nwho didn\u2019t have government authorizations, who had had authorizations only from Parryom\nPoppovitch(ph). Plus, other people who were politically suspect. For instance, a cousin of Lotte\u2019s,\na doctor, who had, who was a director of a hospital and other people who were not considered\nreliable. Leaning, left leaning, or if an engineer who, like me, had come from Romania to\nCzernowitz to the Russians.
