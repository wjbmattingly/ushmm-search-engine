Of course Jewish\npeople because the others wouldn't come and they were told a lot\nof terrible stories and we were very much impressed at least I was\nvery much impressed. Most of our friends did not believe it could\nhappen in Austria.\nSo you knew of Jews who had left Germany to come to Austria\nYes.\nThey told you stories of...?\nSome of them were in camps but at this time it was not extermination\ncamps yet I think but they told us stories and I was very impressed\nand I know a lot of people - it could never happen in Austria.\nDo you remember any stories in particular when you were listening\nto these refugees in Austria?\nYes we had a young actor whose father was a very famous actor as a\nmatter of fact in Germany and he told us that he was ina camp and",

She was sitting\nnext to me and she was .....\nDo you recall her first name?\nOh yes Inge, Inge Seyss-Ingquart and she would brush her sleeves\nwhen she touched us. There were a lot of Jewish girls in the class.\nHalf of the class was Jewish.\nSo she had to wipe her blouse of what - Jewish breath or Jewish\ngerms?\nJewish germs yes I guess so.\nSo they knew you were Jewish or part Jewish in this class?\nOh yes with the name of Grunbaum there was no doubt.\nThere was no doubt. How about your father did he have any\nexperiences with antisemitism? You mentioned that he was an army\nwar veteran?",

        "6\nWell when he was in the army he never told anything about it to us,\nno.\nHow about as a furrier?\nWell he never talked about it. He certainly had some experience\nbecause there was a lot of antisemitism in Austria at the time.\nDo you recall what neighborhood you lived in Vienna? Was it a\nmixed neighborhood or...?\nMixed - but in the neighborhood I really cannot say that I had\nantisemitism, we felt it in school.\nYou had friends who were Protestant, Catholic and Jewish?\nYes but mainly Jewish.\nMainly Jewish friends - of your own age - both genders or just\ngirls?\nAt this time just girls.\nHow about your brother did he have any - do you recall any\nexperiences?\nNot before Hitler came not that he talked about.\nYou mentioned that you were in the theater. Did you have dreams as\nyou grew up of becoming an actress?\nOh sure - we went to the Vienna Conservatory when we were children\nalready, my brother and I, both of us and we took up - this was\ncalled Kinderconservatory - conservatory for children.

First of all there was a lot of unemployment. It\nwas very hard to find a job and the antisemitism was pretty bad.",

        "8\nEven before Hitler came.\nYeah\nDid you follow the career of Inge Seyss-Inquart?\nNo\nDid you know who her father was at that time?\nWell yeah, we know something that he was a Nazi but you know how\nold was I, fifteen or so. We were not so interested in this.\nYou were more interested in art?\nYes much more.\nDo you recall any classmates who were Nazis?\nOh yes we had quite a few. I couldn't tell you the name now because\nthis is too long ago but we had quite a few.\nThey cause any problems in the class - did they try to...?\nWell they separated.\nThey just tried to stay away. Did they attack any students?\nNo.\nHow about the teachers. Did you find them to be sympathetic or\nloyal to the republic?\nWell we had a lot of Jewish teachers in this school and a few who\nwere not Jewish and were more or less antisemitic. We had a few of\nthem too but it was not too bad.\nYou could live with that?\nWe could live with it, yeah.\nDo you remember where you were when the Nazis finally took over\nAustria?",

        "9\nI was in Italy.\nYou were in Italy. How did you get to Italy? How could a nice\nlittle Austrian girl go to Italy?\nGo to Italy? It started out that I was looking for an engagement\nin the theater and I had a contract to teach in Bodenbach which is\nin the Sudentenland and...\nCzechoslovakia then?\nSudentenland, yeah but they were already thinking - German.\nAnd you had to submit all your papers, of course. And I had a\nStage name. My stage name was Hermann, Trude Hermann. Of course\nI had to submit my real name and with Grunbaum right away they\nwouldn't give me the contract.\nThis 1S in Sudentenland?\nYes and the same happened to me in Linz. I had a contract there\ntoo and they wouldn't take me when they found out that I was not\nan aryan..\nThis was before Hitler's time?\nThis was in 1937.\nThat's interesting because your Jewish name - even though you were\na protestant ...\nYes this didn't cut any ice with them.\nLinz and then the Sudentenland. Do you remember any of the towns\nin the Sudentenland?\nTetschen-Bodenbach [Podmokly] it was called. Tetschen-Bodenbach.\nAnd then my agent , you know you had to have an agent, he suggested\nthat I go to Italy because he said I will not get any contract in\na German speaking country.\nWhat did your parents think of your career in the theater and then\ngoing to Italy of all places?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "10\nWell, I was twenty then and could do whatever..\nSo you had relatively liberal parents?\nYes, and I went to Italy and I was in Milano when the anschluss\ncame and my mother wrote me immediately please don't come back\nbecause our contract in Italy was already not expired but had one\nmore month I think to go and she said try to stay in Italy?\nAnd you recall when you went to Italy?\nYes in September 1937.\nAnd you had what a one year, Six months..?\nNo we had a three months contract and then we were another three\nmonths so we were in Italy in March when the anschluss happened -\nin Milano.\nAnd you obviously did not experience employment discrimination?\nNot in Italy, no.\nYour mother said, \"Don't come back.\"\n\"Don't come back, be glad you are in Italy.\"\nWere you glad?\nYes, very much.\nSo you remained in Milan?\nI remained in Milano. We had to go to vote. The German embassy\ncame to the theater, took all our passports away because we were\nthirty girls from Vienna.\nYou had Austrian passports?\nAustrian passports, yeah, and they told us we had to go to the\nconsulate and when we were there they said we had to go to vote on\nthe torpedo boat \"Wolf\" which was in Genoa. We would be brought",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "11\nthere from the German Embassy.\nSo the German consulate in Genoa..\nNo it was a German boat and on this you voted because a boat is\nterritory, right?\nOkay so a German boat in Genoa was going to be your voting booth?\nYes.\nAnd they gave you of course free transportation?\nFree transportation. And I didn't want to go but there was a very\nintelligent, I don't know what he was, attache or something, who\ncalled me in his office and said go and vote because you won't stop\nHitler but he could stop you.\nThis 1S a German attache at the consulate in Milan?\nIn Milan, yeah.\nSo he advised you to vote in the plebiscite approving...\nHe said vote what you want but go to vote.\nAnd you voted?\nI voted, yes.\nDo you want to tell us how you voted?\nOh you had to say yes because you had to give the thing, the slip\nyou voted on, you had to give in an envelope and were not allowed\nto close the envelope. You had to leave it open and then you handed\nit to some of the soldiers who were standing there and he took your\npassport, looked at your passport - so - what chance did you have\nto say no?\nRight and besides they would have known who you were and it would\nhave defeated the purpose.\nImmediately, yeah.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "12\nAnd were they surprised in any way that you were voting?\nYes.\nThey could tell you had a Jewish name.\nYes. One soldier said to me I think you are on the wrong boat. We\ndon't go to Palestine.\nSense of humor. This is a Nazi, possibly?\nPossibly not. Because otherwise he would probably not let me vote.\nAnd the real reason why you voted?\nBecause this gentleman told me it would be better for me if I do\nit. I alone could not stop Hitler but he could stop me and he\nwould have.\nAnd of course your real sentiment was..\nNot very friendly, no.\nWhat were the rest of your family doing? They were still in Vienna?\nMy father was in Switzerland on business and he stayed there and\ndid not come back. My mother and my brother were in Vienna. My\nbrother tried to get out of the country which wasn't easy because\nyou needed an exit visa in order to get out but he had applied for\nan international music - piano - competition in Brussel and with\nthis he got the exit visa and he went to Brussels. They didn't let\nhim play because for them he was a German. And he tried to go to\nFrance and he couldn't get a visa to France either so I wrote him\na letter from Italy telling him that I was very sick and he should\nimmediately come and visit me and he went to the Italian consulate\nand they gave him a visa to enter Italy and so he got a transit\nvisa from France and got off the train.\nDid he discover that you were sick or did he discover that you made\nup the story?\nOh he knew I made up the story. He knew I wasn't sick. But he had",

        "13\nthe transit visa in France and he got off the train and went to\nParis and my father was in Paris at this time and so he got always\nI think a three weeks or six weeks visa, I don't remember, and\nalways to apply again and again.\nSo basically you faked an illness in order to justify this transit\nvisa through France ..\nAnd the Italians gave him the visa.\nWhich then allowed him to go France?\nTo get the transit visa from France.\nAnd your mother meanwhile..?\nMy mother was in Prague in the meantime.\nShe left Vienna?\nShe left Vienna for good, yes.\nWhat had happened to your brother's musical career if you back up\njust a little bit?\nWell he started in Paris with Claude Arrau\nIf we could go further back. He had begun at age fourteen in Vienna\nand then in 1938 the Nazis come. At that point where was his\ncareer?\nHe was still a student in the Conservatory conducting classes and\nhe gave concerts in Czechoslovakia and gave a concert in Karlsbat\n[Karlovy Vary]. He gave several concerts in Vienna and then he\nwent to France and he studied. There he never worked. He studied\nthere with Claude Arrau. He tried to go to the United States but\nhe didn't have a sponsor so my mother wrote a letter to a very\nfamous violinist who my brother knew, Fritz Kreisler and Fritz\nKreisler went with him to the consulate and got him a student visa\nfor America and he came here as a student.\nDo you recall when?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "14\nYes in '39.\nIn '39. Before the war?\nI think in August '39.\nAnd you were still in Italy?\nI was in Italy. I didn't have a sponsor.\nStill in Milan?\nNo. In Rome, Milan, - we traveled. In Italy you traveled.\nSo you had work?\nIT had work. I always had work.\nHow about your passport? After the Germans took over Austria, you\nvoted. Were you still with an Austrian passport or did you...?\nNo, the Austrian passport was good till the end of '38. I had an\nAustrian passport as long as possible.\nWhen you had to renew your passport?\nI renewed my passport. I wrote to one of my aunts in Vienna.\nPlease send me an aryanmacher [262] Do you know what that is?\nProof of aryan.\nThis is very hard when you have a Jewish father. So she sent me\nall the documents of my mother and my maternal grandparents and my\nmother's certificate of matrimony. This was the funniest thing\nthat I got a German passport without a J. I'll never know because\nin this said that my father was the son of Ivor Grunbaum and\nZara[270] geboren Cohen. This is really not real.\nSo it was falsified?\nNo, no I got it\nThrough anybody's help? Was it a mistake or was it just that you",

        "15\nhad a nice guy?\nA nice guy\nA nice guy, but he certainly wasn't Jewish. This was the German\nconsulate?\nIt was the German consulate.\nIn Milan.\nIn Milan, no, in Rome. He gave it to me and once you had a German\npassport, you were okay. The Italians didn't ask any questions.\nSo you had a non-Jewish passport even though your name is still\nJewish?\nYeah\nWere there any changes when the war breaks out?. Your brother is\nin the United States?\nMy mother was in France and my father, too. My father was in Paris\nand my mother was in Lyons with her second husband.\nOh, so your parents had divorced. Were they divorced before the\nanschluss?\nBefore, much before that.\nBefore you even went to Italy?\nYes, I was seventeen when my parents divorced so that must have\nbeen '34.\nThe year Dolffus...\nThe Dolffus year, yes.\nBut it had nothing to do with Dolffus?\nNo it had nothing to do with Dolffus?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "16\nNothing to do with being Jewish or Protestant or Catholic?\nNo, in fact her second husband was Jewish too.\nSo your mother was pro- Jewish.\nWas pro-Jewish, yeah.\nDid your father remarry?\nNo but my mother came with her second husband. They went from\nPrague ... He was Czechoslovakian nationality, lived always in\nVienna.\nYelenek [293] is the\nYelenek, yeah. He and his brother were born in Russia, by\ncoincidence because their father worked there for several years and\nwhen they applied for a visa to the United States - they came on\nthe Russian quota which was wide open - and got immediately a visa\nbecause they thought they were coming on the Czechoslovakian quota\nwhich was waiting list for years. But they didn't know that in\nAmerican law your nationality where you were born and not what\npassport you have so these two were born in Odessa and my mother\nwas married to a Russian. They got immediately the visa and they\ncame via Casablanca because they could not go through France anymore\nand could not go to Spain. Spain wouldn't let them in so they had\nto go Casablanca and from Casablanca to Portugal and from Portugal\nthey went to Cuba and from Cuba they went to the United States.\nDo you recall when this was?\nThis must have been '40, no '41, no '40.\nHad the Germans gone into Paris yet? ..in the Vichy?\nNo, I think before that.\nBut after the beginning of the war?\nNo they were in Paris already, the Germans when my mother left.

I don't quite recall.\nWas it winter?\nI don't recall that.\nWell, maybe we'll remember later. But anyway by 1941 they were\nhere.\nThey were here, yeah. I think they came 1940, the end of 1940. It\nwas certainly not '41 because I think they came in the fall of 1940.\nThat would make sense. After the Germans had occupied France but\nstill the freedom of Vichy because in Vichy you could go to\nCasablanca.\nYes. It certainly was 1940 because '41 was already Pearl Harbor\nand they were here already in Pearl Harbor.\nMeanwhile you're still in Italy.\nI was still in Italy.\nAnd Italy 1s in the war in 1940.\nIt was in the war. That's why I don't recall. We could not\ncorrespond too well then. The mail took very long. I mean it was\nstill possible because America was not in the war. But a letter\ntook months.\nAs a German passport holder you were an ally of Fascist Italy in\n1940.\nYes, but the Fascists didn't bother you.\nDid you get even better treatment?",

        "18\nNo. We always got good treatment.\nHow about the anti-Jewish laws that Mussolini introduced. Did they\nhave any affect on you?\nNo\nWere there any examples of anti-semitism?\nNo I'd never seen anti-semitism in Italy. No, never.\nWere you working - in Rome mainly?\nI was working - no, we traveled around because in Italy you don't\nwork in a theater. You work in a company and the company travels\naround?\nAnd who were you working with? Were they mixed, Italians,\nforeigners?\nAll Italian.\nSo you were the only Austrian?\nOh, we were a couple of girls.\nWere there others who were Jewish besides you?\nOh yeah.\nItalians as well as Austrians?\nWell, Italians I cannot tell. We never talked about religion.\nThat was never brought up, never.\nIt was all acting, art.\nItalians never ask you any questions. We had to go to the police\nevery six months to renew the working permit. They never ask any\nquestions.\nDo you recall some of the places where you toured? Did you perform\nsay for troops?",

After all the German troops...\nNo, we never performed for German troops, no.\nBy this time you have very little contacts with your parents, your\nfather?\nWell, as soon as the war started in Austria they had no contact\nwith anyone outside because you could not write to America. I\ndidn't know where my father was in France because he left Paris -\nhe came to Nizza [Nice] and then he was in hiding for the rest of\nthe war.\nBut you knew your family was - your mother and your brother - were\nsafe?\nI know that they were in America.\nSo your father was the only member of your family that you worried\nabout?\nYes I was because France was occupied by the Germans.\nHow did you feel about Italy being on the same side as Hitler?\nWell we always had the feeling that the Italians didn't like it too\nmuch - being on the side - but they had very little choice because\nthe German troops were already in Brenner and Mussolini was not too\nhappy either I think.\nDo you remember any specific instances of Italian actor or actresses\nvoicing their opinions against Germany or against Mussolini?\nNo. You did not voice against Mussolini too openly but we never\ntalked about politics really. We were glad we could stay there and\nwe worked - politics was never a big thing with us.",

        "Politics came to you now. Suddenly in 1943 Italy surrendered and\nthe Germans occupy all of Italy. Do you remember any changes in\nyour life then?\nYes. Of course, first of all the theaters were closed. When the\nAmericans landed I think in Sicily it was and in Naples the Germans\ndestroyed all their papers in the consulate so they did not know\nwho was in Italy of German descendants or aryan or Jewish or nothing.\nThey knew nothing. They only could go to the police stations, to\nthe Questura, and there they found out where German people were\nliving. But the Italians would not give the information about\nreligion, never did. To them everybody was an aryan.\nThe Germans knew that you were where?\nIn Rome and we were called in the German consulate and had the\nchoice to return to the Reich or work as interpreters. Of course\nwe worked as interpreters because nobody wanted to return to the\nReich.\nSo you worked as an interpreter for the Germans?\nFor three, four months and there were a lot of German girls who\nspoke Italian and after the war I remember the UNRRA came and we\ncould get some food packages from the UNRRA and all the interpreters\nI met there were Jews who had worked for the Germans just like we,\nMimi and I and several others.\nDid you change your name at any time?\nNo because for the German Grunbaum is not a Jewish name. We had an\nofficer who was called Grunbaum and he certainly was not a Jew.\nFor the Austrians this was a Jewish name.\nThat's an interesting difference.\nOh yes, Rosenbach in Austria was Jewish.\nAnd one of the leading Nazis was a Rosenbach.\nSo Grunbaum was a German Jewish name in Austria.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "21\nIn Austria it was Jewish.\nIn Germany it was a non-Jewish name.\nBoth. There were Jews who were called Grunbaum but not necessarily.\nAnd did you look Jewish or aryan?\nI don't know. Apparently aryan enough because nobody ever asked me\nanything.\nWhat color eyes did you have?\nI have blue eyes.\nYou still do, blue eyes and your hair was....?\nRed at the time. But anyway the Italians didn't give out any\ninformation. They saved a lot of people, I must say.\nDo you Know of people who were Saved.\nOh yes, at least all of them who worked with me there. I know of\na lot of people who were in Italy and everybody will tell you the\nsame. The Italians did not give out information to the Germans.\nNow in Rome as you know in late 1943 there were some deportations.\nThe Germans attempted to deport Italian Jews to Auschwitz. Did you\nwitness any of these incidents?\nNo, but I know where it happened in Largo Argentina but I didn't\nsee it myself, thank goodness.\nDid you know of anybody who was sent away?\nI didn't know anybody, no.\nHow about incidents of armed resistance. For example in March 1944\nthere was a major partisan attack on the SS and then there was the\nretaliation.\nThe retaliation. Three hundred in the catacombs. I remember that\nbecause I lived very near where this attack took place.",

Who didn't know?\nWas it a name that inspired trust and love or..?\nNo, hate. He was terrible. Every day, this was in '44 just before\nthe war ended, they had some American and English prisoners and\nthey would parade them and the Americans would go with the V sign\nand the Italians applauded.\nThe Italians applauded the American prisoners that were paraded by\nthe Germans in Rome. Were you ever in danger?\nWell, I don't think so. I was not really in danger.\nAnd you didn't have to hide?\nYes, in the last few weeks, I did hide because I was afraid that\nthey would take me with them when the Germans left Rome.\nSo you were an interpreter for three or four months and then what\ndid you do after? You kind of drew away?\nNo, I was pregnant at the time and could quit work in May, 1944 and\nthen I had a very nice boss I must say and he called me up and said\ngo in hiding because they are coming to get you. Because they\nwanted gentile persons, everybody, to go with them up north and of\ncourse I didn't want to go.\nThat was the original choice as I recall. Either return to the\nReich or work as an interpreter?\nBut there they wanted us to go, all interpreters, to go north with\nthe troops and I didn't want to do that.\nAnd why was this sudden renewed interest in going north. Was\nanything happening near Rome?\nOh yeah, the Americans.",

        "23\nThe Americans entered. You probably remembered the date that they\nentered?\nYes, June 4, 1944.\nSo you hid just before June 4, 1944.\nYes, about ten days before.\nAnd then what happened after the Americans came? Did you have\nwork?\nOh yeah, at first I returned to the theater and then I worked as an\ninterpreter for the Americans until '48.\nBy then you must have known quite a few languages. You started out\nbeing German speaking..\nYes, I spoke Italian and English. I learned English in school.\nYou learned English when you were in Vienna before going to Italy?\nIn school, yeah.\nSo you would be interpreting between the Americans and the Italians\nor between the Americans and German prisoner?\nNo, between Americans and Italians.\nAnd they paid you?\nThey paid me, sure. And then we went to Argentina, my husband and\nI.\nSo you had married in Italy.\nYes.\nHad a child?\nThis one. [Daughter was present at interview]\nBorn as an Italian citizen.",

        "24\nNo, aS an Austrian citizen.\nMale, female?\nFemale, name Irene.\nYour husband was also Austrian?\nNo my husband was German.\nJewish, non-Jewish?\nNon-Jewish.\nHe was in Italy at the time?\nHe was in Italy at the time. Was a prisoner and we left for\nArgentina in 1948 because we didn't have a visa for the states.\nThere was a long waiting period.\nHe was a prisoner of the Americans but he had been there a German\nmilitary?\nMilitary, yes.\nAny word from your brother, meanwhile?. Your brother was in the\nUnited States.\nMy brother was in the United States and of course I didn't hear\nfrom him during the war because you could not write but as soon as\nthe war was over, no, not as soon, because you couldn't write for\nguite some time. But one day he came to visit me. In '45 he came\nin September. He was then stationed in the third army in Shongau,\nGermany.\nHe visited you in Italy.\nIn Italy, in Rome.\nAnd you hadn't seen him since when?\nSince 1937, eight years. A lot of time.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "25\nCan you recollect what he was doing between 1939 and 1945 when you\nfinally saw him?\nYes, he was in New York. He studied with Schnabel, Arthur Schnabel,\nthe pianist. He gave concerts. He taught. He worked with a\nRussian singer, studied with her, accompanied her. And then he was\ndrafted in the army. Well he was not drafted, he was a student\nhere so they gave him a choice.\nWhat was the choice?\nThe choice was to join the army or have to leave the country.\nAnd return where?\nThat 1s the question.\nWhat kind of citizenship did he have at that point?. He obviously\nwas not an American citizen.\nNo, he was German, I guess.\nGerman, So were they threatening to return him to Germany?.\nWell, they would not return him anywhere. He just has to leave the\ncountry and try to find another country which would take him. But\nhe has a choice to join the army which he did. First he was in North\nCarolina, I think was his boot camp and several others.\nDid he serve in Europe before he saw you?\nYeah, because he came in '44 to Europe and he came to visit me in\n'45. And just a month before he died, he was killed, an accident,\nwe don't know.\nHe was killed a month after you last saw him?\nYes\nDo you recall him telling any stories, any dramatic experiences as\na soldier?. Did he describe the fighting? Did he describe what\nhe saw in Germany, perhaps concentration camps?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "26\nYes he told me he saw concentration camps. He said everyone they\ninterviewed never heard of Nazis. Nobody was ever a Nazi.\nHe served in the US army. Was he attached to a particular unit?\nYes, intelligence. And he was an interpreter.\nSo in some ways you had similar jobs. And his experience was that\nno German...?\nEver was Nazi.\nDid he believe? What were his feelings towards the Germans?\nNo. Well was not enthusiastic about the Germans. He didn't feel\nany hatred, I think. That was not in his character. All he wanted\nwas to go back to America, resume his career aS a musician. He\ndidn't think he could be a pianist anymore because three years of\nnot practicing the piano daily makes your fingers stiff but he\nwanted to go into conducting because he had the qualification to be\na conductor. But music was his life. He was supposed to go home\non November 19, 1945. On the eighteenth of November he told one of\nhis friends that he was going to see Richard Strauss in Garmisch-\nPartnkirchen and he left early in the morning and was never seen\nalive again.\nDo you know what happened to him?\nWe only know what the army told us, that he had an accident. That's\nwhat they said at the time. But not right away. He was listed as\nmissing because nobody knew where he was and it was November and it\nstarted snowing and they could not search anymore for him and after\nthe snow melted, my sister-in-law got a letter that he was found in\nMittenwald with a fractured skull. And that is all we know. And\nat first he was buried in Metz and then I think the French wanted\nthis cemetery to be eliminated so my sister-in-law got a letter\nwhere she wanted him buried and she said in New York and that's\nwhere he is, in Farmingdale, the military cemetery.\nDo you have any opinions as to how and why he might have died and\nwhy the military was so secretive?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "27]\nI don't know. I only know that my brother told me when he was in\nRome that the Germans always thought when he interviewed somebody\nthat he was also the one who passes judgment which was not the case.\nHe was only the interpreter. And he said the Germans if you have\na uniform think you're a general. You have so much to say, which\nhe didn't. But I always thought it had something to do with the\nGermans, that it was not an accident. He was not a mountain\nclimber. He liked to take a walk in the woods but not in the\nmountains. He never did that before, why should he have done it\nthe day before he had to leave?\nAnd then you eventually came to the United States?\nI came to the United States much later because my mother was our\nsponsor, but the Austrian quota was impossible, very, very small.\nI could go on the German quota with my husband, because he was born\nin Germany. So we're in Argentina and we finally got the visa in\n1950. We were supposed to leave on September 13. On September 12\ncame the McCarren [674] Act and we already had the luggage aboard\nand we were called to come to the consulate, which we did and the\nconsulate asked to see our passport. We gave him the passport and\nhe put in \"canceled.\"\nWhy?\nBecause my husband was born ina totalitarian country. And at this\ntime there was the McCarren Act that nobody in a country which had\nat one time a totalitarian regime could go to the United States.\nSo we had to stay in Argentina. I remembered that Truman vetoed\nthis and so I went to the consulate once a week. The poor consulate\nwhen he saw me already, \"No, no visa yet.\" And we got our visa on\nMay of 1951 and left and we came to the United States on May 28,\n1951.\nLooking back on your experiences and thinking of your career in the\ntheater and acting..\nIt was not much of a career\nIf you had to select the most dramatic moment of your life at least\nduring the time of the war what would you..\nThe most dramatic I think was when we were in Rhodes",

        "28\nand I still had my Austrian passport. While I was in Rhodes\u2019 I met\ntwo Viennese men who told me their story that they came over the\nborder into Italy because they had an American visa and wanted to\ngo to the States but the Germans wouldn't give them an exit visa so\nthey went somewhere over the border and came to Italy without the\nvisa and registered ina hotel. But the clerk brought the passport\nto the police and they saw they had no visa and they were not\nallowed to traverse Italy anymore and you cannot go to America from\nVenice. So they went on the first boat to Egypt and thought they\ncould go from there and then they told me the story that Egypt\nwouldn't let them go ashore and they came back to Italy and they\nwouldn't let them go ashore and they traveled back and forth.\nYou're in Rhodes and these people are traveling back and forth\nwithout the visa?\nThey're also in Rhodes and once the Governor of Rhodes was on the\nboat and he was a Jew himself and he let them stay for awhile in\nRhodes. He gave them permission to get off the boat and they were\ntrying to get a visa to Egypt which they finally got. They told me\nthe story and when we came back to Italy in Bari [710] and we wanted\nto go ashore because (actually we traveled to Venice but we stood\na day in Bari and I was with this English ballet and all the girls\ngot their passport back except me so I said, \"Where's my passport?\"\nSo I went in and this Italian said I'm sorry you cannot get to shore\nbecause you are Jewish and Jews cannot enter Italy anymore.\nThis 1s an Italian official.\nAn Italian official.\nIn which year. Do you remember the year?\n\"39. No excuse me, '38. After the Anschluss. I still had the\nAustrian passport hadn't expired. I said I'm not Jewish and my\npassport is still okay till the end of the year. And he said but\nif you were not Jewish you would have already changed it like all\nthe others did. And so I remember that I voted and this was stamped\ninto the passport. And first I did not remember it. I was so\nnervous I saw myself going back and forth on this boat like the\npeople told me. Oh, G-d, what am I going to do? And then I\nremembered. I voted and I have that in the passport. And as soon\nas he saw that he said oh I'm sorry and he gave me the visa.",

        "29\nSo I remembered the man at the consulate. He was right.\nSo your decision to vote for the Nazis saved you. This would have\nbeen after Mussolini enacted the anti-Jewish laws. This was why\nthey gave you a hard time. But these are the Italians that are\ngiving you trouble.\nYes, well I'm Italian. But it didn't last very long. AS soon as\nthey saw this stamp, I could go in and in Rome they never gave me\ntrouble.\nAnd then you got the German passport without a J.\nI got it without a J. That I think was my most dramatic moment\nbecause I really saw myself on the boat going back and forth to\nRhodes.\nAnd no amount of acting could have saved you, just quick thinking.\nYes\nIf your brother were here and had to answer the same question what\ndo you think his answer would be based on his experiences.\nI don't know. He had a lot of dramatic experiences in Germany when\nhe was a soldier because he told me that one day there was a terrible\nbombardment. He said I was hungry, I was going into the kitchen\nand everybody said don't be crazy. You're not going out when the\nbombs are firing and he said, \"Yes, I'm going out.\" And he went out\nof the barracks where they were staying and into the next one where\nthe kitchen is and the barracks where they were staying was bombed\nand he was the only survivor.\nBy American aircraft.\nNo, by the Germans.\nGermany still had an air force.\nYes they still had an air force.\nHow about before he left Vienna.

This professor\nNielius [759] who was a teacher for the conducting classes. And he\nwas always a star pupil and he always talked about him. As soon as\nthe Nazis came in he wouldn't let him into the building anymore.\nSo he was expelled from the Vienna conservatory?\nOh yes.\nNo more concerts.\nNo more.

        "Just a wild hunch.\nI don't think it was such a wild hunch. I think it was in the\nstars that he would come but people didn't want to believe it. The\nAustrian Jews did not want to believe that it couldn't happen in\nVienna. I don't know why they don't believe it. There was a lot of\nanti-semitism there and Austria was very poor at the time. They\nhad a lot of unemployed people. Austria was very poor and they\nthought that an Anschluss to Germany would - because everybody heard\nthat since Hitler is the Germans have more work and everything is\ngoing better --\nSo there was economic hope in Germany. Was he popular? Did people\nadmire Hitler?\nNone of my friends admired him but certainly a lot of people did.\nAnd you recall the reasons that why they admired him. What was there\nabout him that they liked?\nThey thought that when Hitler will come they will all work,\neverything will be better. This did not last very long because I\ndon't think he treated the Austrians too well. He was an Austrian,\nbut he didn't like Austria.\nNow you, being in Italy must have been interesting vantage port in\nthat Italy had been the ally of Austria.\nYes, for a long time Dolffus' widow as a matter of fact was in Italy\nat the time and Schuschnigg was in Italy.\nYou remember what the Italian reaction was to the Anschluss?\nThe Italians didn't like it at all. They had very little choice\nbecause Hitler's army was on the Brenner pass already at that time.\nAs a matter of fact Hitler came to Italy, I think, in '38 right\nafter the Anschluss. I remember because I was living in a hotel\nwith another Viennese who was also Jewish and we were called to the\npolice and held there the whole day.
