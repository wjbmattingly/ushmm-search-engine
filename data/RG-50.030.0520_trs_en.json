And th-this I remember, and we were staying in the shelter that was in the\nbasement in our apart -- in our building, and my brother was only li-little, he -- he -- the few\nmonths and he was 1-1n the stroller, and I remember when they had the -- the pause between the -\n- the -- the bombing, that I used to go to Danusha, to her house, because she was on the fir-fir --\nground floor. And this I re -- her mother made lunch for her and she made lunch for me, and she\nmade the eggs upside down. And from this time I remember the taste even, those eggs. But later\non -- few days later we moved to my grandparents shelter because it was bigger. And we stayed\nwith ou-our grandparents til the Russian came.",

        "A: When the Russian came -- came in, it was change in my life because I -- first I went to\nkindergarten for the first -- first trme. And then my -- my parents lost the business, and I\nremember the -- the -- the evening that my fa --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number one, side B. If you could continue where we got cut off.",
        "A: A-A-Af -- one evening after the -- the Russian came to -- to Lvov and occupied the -- this --\nthe city, my father came at evening home and he said to my mother that right now we don\u2019t have\nanything. That wha-wha-what happened, the Russian, they took the whole business, they took --\ncame to the sto-store and they told my father to give him the key, and they sa -- t-told him to -- to\n-- to -- to leave th-the business. And th-this is wh-wh-what happened. We -- we -- they -- my\nparent, they have a few employees that were wor-working for -- for -- for them. They -- the --\nsome of them went home, some of them stayed and worked for the Russian government. And th-\nthis was a big shock for -- for my family. We -- we lost our en -- en -- and a -- nanny and we lost\nour maid because our maid said that now everybody is equal she doesn\u2019t have to work for -- for\nrich people. And 1-1-1t was a -- a completely -- completely change in our life. My mother stayed\nat home, my father started to look for -- for j -- some kind of job that we can survive, and t-to --\nto survive he needed like two jobs because the salary were so low, that from one job you -- you\ncouldn\u2019t, you know, e-e-exist. I don\u2019t mean t-to -- to any luxury, but it was the simple food was\nvery difficult to get. You had to stay in line and you had to had some type of connection that you\ncan get a -- a loaf of bro -- o-of -- of bread, o-of a little bit of butter. It was very difficult, and\nbesides it was politically difficult too, because you know -- I didn\u2019t feel this maybe so much, but\nI remember that my parent were very scared and afraid because they belonged to -- to bourgeois\nand bourgeois sh-should be in Siberia, not in -- 1-in Lvov. And besides too -- t -- our apartment,\nwe got two tenants. They came from a side of Poland that was under the German occupation.\nThey -- they were the Jewish refu -- refugee to came from Krakow, from other cities, and my\nparents took to -- to they apartment a -- a -- wa -- one room was fo-for a -- a woman, a -- one\nwoman, I remember her name, she was -- her name was Bagnerova. And the other room for -- 1-\nit was for a father and a son that esca-escape from Krakow or some other city. And this way we\nhad only wa-- wa -- one bedroom and -- and the kitchen and the -- the kitchen was for th-the --\nthe -- the tenants -- th-the -- the refugee, they could use th-the kitchen, th-they used to cook, and\nthey used the -- the bathroom, 1t was common for all of us.",
        "Q: Was that something that -- that you did to -- your family did to take them in because they\nwere refugees, or was this somehow required by the Russians to -- to live like this?",
        "A: It was both. I-It was -- Russian didn\u2019t like that you have t-too many rooms, the fa-family, and\nbesides, it was y -- they wanted to -- to help those refugees who really didn\u2019t have a place where\nto -- where to live.",
        "Q: So do you -- do you remember this as a pretty difficult time, or what are your personal kind of\nrecollections from this particular era?",
        "A: If -- if you take that e -- we will co-co-compare the life that I\u2019ve had before and the life that I\nhave after \u201939, it was different. It was more difficult, it was more tension, because my parents\nwere always very tense, and were always, you know, a -- a -- I-I-l-looking outside with -- they\nwere afraid. It was completely different. It was for me, for a child it wasn\u2019t so bad that for them,\nbut I could f-feel th-the tension that was going on in the family. And f-for me, I was still playing\nwith the kids, I -- I was going to the kindergarten. Thi-This time I -- I had a m -- my mother in\nhome, and from this point of view I was very happy.",
        "Q: Did you have any awareness at this -- at this earlier stage about the Nazis, before they actually\ncame in, did you have any awareness as a young child?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything about the Nazi til the -- in 1941 the -- when they march to the city of\nLvov. Nothing. It was -- probably my -- my parents, they ba -- they s-spoke with the refugee\n[indecipherable] but I -- I, like a child, I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to this. I didn\u2019t know\nanything about the Nazi before.",
        "Q: So now tell me what are your earliest first memories about the Nazis taking over Lvov, and --\nand when is this, and -- and give me a sense of how old you are about this time.",
        "A: It was in June, 1941. This -- I -- I was al-already six years old, and I remember this vividly\nbecause it was the same first -- 1t was th-the -- the -- the airplane and the bombing, and we went\nto the shel-shelter, and I was watching through the -- through the window the same similar like\n\u00b039, but 1-it -- this time it was -- my -- my parents were co-completely de-depressed and th-th --\nmy father said th-th-th -- I remember to me, he -- we-we had bad, but this -- this is worse, what is\n-- was coming. And it -- it really was like this. The -- he -- I -- I remember hear the screaming\nand yelling and th-th-the Germans, the -- the -- on the motorcycles are roaring through the --\nthrough this street, a-and the Ukrainians who -- who were so glad that the German came. They\nwere happy, the women, Ukrainian women were thi -- giving flowers to -- t-to the Germans,\nbecause the Germans promised them that they will have the independent Ukraine now. This is\nwhy they were so -- so happy. And the one who were suffering the most, they were the Je --\nJews, because Ukrainian hate the Jews before the war, and did th -- the -- pogroms before the\nwar, now they had the free hand from the Germans and they did -- did a ver-very good job by k-\nkilling and beating the Jews.",
        "Q: So you have -- you have a -- a vivid memory of actually seeing Nazis on the sort of day that\nthey come in? Tell me a little bit more about what you actually saw, and this is from your -- from\nyour home, right?",
        "A: I saw this from my home, from the window. I saw the Nazi coming, riding the bicycles, and I\nsaw th-the -- the Germans pa-parading, and then th-the Ukrainians joining them, and the\ncommotion what happened o-on the street, I saw th -- everything I saw through the window, and\nI remember vividly.",
        "Q: Do you -- did you see violent things right in front of you from the window from the start, or --\nor was -- you didn't see that directly from there?",
        "A: No, from the window I could see, I could see how the Ukrainian were hitting the -- th-the\nJewish people. The -- th-the German didn\u2019t got involved so much, they -- they left th-the -- th-the\nbad work to the Ukrainians. And they took advantage of this and they really ber -- th-they were\nterrible, they were worse than Germans.",
        "Q: An-And how scared did this make you feel as a six year old at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, I was very scared, and I -- I remember that from that time I never went out. I was inside\nthe apartment, because my parents, they didn\u2019t le-let me go out, even I didn\u2019t play in our -- our\nbackyard. I di -- di -- I didn't go to -- to -- thi -- thi -- this was the end of my childhood, th-that\u2019s\nit. From this moment I became already a grownup.",
        "Q: Did you get to see that friend of yours any more from the building, the concierge\u2019s daughter?",
        "A: Yeah, she was the only one that I used to go to her and play in her apartment with her, yeah.\nShe was the only one.",
        "Q: Did you -- were you aware of, or did you know about then the pogroms taking place in the\nimmediate aftermath, you know, after the Nazis came in and the Ukrainians, I guess, killed, you\nknow, thousands, right?",
        "A: I-I saw this and I knew about it, and I -- I ur -- my parents didn\u2019t tell me straight, but I was\nvery observant, and through the window when I was looking, I saw lot of things. But, you know,\nthey try to keep from us. They didn\u2019t want to -- to scare u-us too much, but th-the time was\nterrible because the Germans started to come already to our apartment and they took all our\nfurnitures, all our belongings. But they took it, I remember they came and they took th-the piano\nand th-the -- the German, he -- he came and he saw the piano and he started to play, he played\nvery well, and he liked the piano. And he -- he -- he send people and they took it. We -- we were\nsitting on the floor with few belongings and that\u2019s it. Everything was gone.",
        "Q: Were -- were you all still living there, the other tenants with you still?",
        "A: I -- I-I -- I -- th-th-the German used to come, a-and used to take Jewish people from the\napartments, and one night, on the second fr -- on th-the same fl -- no, it was on the second floor,\nthey came and they took the owner of the -- of the building, it was a Jewish man, and they took\nthe -- the owner. And then they went to the third floor, and they went to the ot -- 1t was a two\napartment, but they told that this is one apartment, similar that on the second floor. That mean\nthey took those people who live on the right side and they didn\u2019t come to our apartment. It was a\nsheer luck that they didn\u2019t take us. But 1-1t was -- they were picking, you know, just coming to\nthe -- and taking Jews from the apartment, then they told us that we have to take our things and\nleave the apartment. And we left. We went to another place on Zamar Stenowska 34, that\nsomehow my grandfather, he -- he said some relative used to live there, and we moved there in --\nin one room, it was maybe 10 - 20 people, and we stayed there for -- for a week, and 1-it was\nvery crowded, terrible, and we moved to another apartment, also on Zamar Stenowska street, but\nit was little bit farther. It was number 124, and we stayed there in the apartment together. It was\nwith one bedroom and one kitchen and we stayed together with my aunt and two children in the\nsame place, for awhile.",
        "Q: What was going on with your -- your father and I don\u2019t know if your -- I guess your mother\nwasn\u2019t working when the Russians came, but what happened to your father\u2019s work at this stage?",
        "A: During the Russian o-occupation, di -- my father w-work in -- in -- in two places. He -- he\nwork one pla -- place, 1-it was for a s-spot cleaning and he was working there, they hire hi-him\nbecause his friend was a doctor there, and he took my father and he said that he is a doctor too,\nand he work there. And it -- it was another place that he was working, I think it was with s-some\nkind of supplies. I know that he worked in two places.",
        "Q: Was he able to do that once the Nazis came in?",
        "A: No, once the na -- Nazis came in, this was end, finito, no work. We -- we -- we -- h-he -- he\ndidn't work, he -- he found maybe so-something, you know, st-still but this was completely\ndifferent, it wasn\u2019t in the -- in this place, and h-he had to, you know, find something to -- to\nsupply us with -- with the basic th-things to eat. And I -- I don\u2019t know exactly where he was\nworking because it was a short time, th-then -- then we moved to Zamar Stenowska, then we\nmove in another place, and he was working, he was working like a carpenter when we leave,\nbecause this already was ghetto. They move -- from Kopernica we went to Zamar Stenowska, it\nwas ghetto, but 1-1t was open and they didn\u2019t had -- had the fence yet. And th-th-they -- th-the --\nthe Germans, e-every few months they were cutting from the space from -- from the ghetto, and\nthe Jews had to move to different place. And -- and we move a few times, we -- we move from\none place to another, because the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller, and at a certain time, I\nthink it was in -- in \u00b042, m-maybe that 1-1-1t -- it came mu-much smaller and it became cal-call-\ncalled Julak.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying those times that you moved, that was actually because the Nazis, the\nGermans were saying to your family, you have to get into the ghetto now, you have to keep\nmoving.",
        "A: [indecipherable] exactly, they were -- yes. Th-Th-They were moving all over us, you know,\nyou had to -- to take it -- each time you have to take less things with -- with you, only what you\nhave o-on you a-a-and -- a-and move to a different place, and 1t was very crowded, people was\nliving for few family in the same apartment, because it -- it was getting -- th-they wanted to have\nJews as m -- as much concentrated in one place that it will be much easier to kill them.",
        "Q: What were some of the items if -- if you could only take a few things each time, were there\nany like favorite items you remember as a child that you just had to hold onto and take with you\neach time?",
        "A: I -- th -- a -- the -- basically, 1-1t -- it was a -- ma -- my mother used to take always something\nfor -- for my brother to -- to -- to -- to eat like milk, or something, and whatever we were\nwearing, but wherever I went for pla -- to place, I had one things that I wanted to wear, it was my\nsweater that my grandmother knitted for me before the war. And I cherish this sweater, I -- I\ndon\u2019t know wh-wha -- what was, you know, what were my feelings that I g-get so attached to\nthis sweater that I was always wer -- wearing, trying -- whatever it -- w-we move, I -- I -- I took\nthe sweater with me.",
        "Q: And that, of course, is a sweater that you -- explain what -- what happened with that sweater,\njust fast-forward for one moment.",
        "A: Yeah, th-th-th -- the sweater, 1-1-1 -- was saved, together with me -- me. It went through the\nghetto, through the sewer, and then it went with me to -- from L -- from Lvov to Krakow, from\nKrakow to Israel, and from Israel it went with me to United States, and lastly I donated this to\nthe -- to the Washington -- the Jewish Holocaust Museum, and is there on the exhibition.",
        "Q: What were some of the other -- I guess, could you explain -- the times that you were moving\nfrom place to place, and the places where you lived, were there these round-ups going on? I\nguess, actions?",
        "A: Oh, the aksia?",
        "Q: Yeah, if you can explain more about that.",
        "A: Oh, the -- the -- the aktion, they call these aksia, and th-this was a -- a plan fr-from a German\nand the Ukrainian to t-t-take th-the Jews, as many they could for yu -- or con -- or kill them on\nthe spot, or take them -- around Lvov it was a place called Piaski where they killed them, or they\ntook them to the concentration camps. They used to come with the lorries and pack the lorries\nwi-with -- with the Jewish people in the terrible, terrible con -- circumstances that -- that they\nwere hitting them and killing them on the way to -- on the way to the lorries, and it was plan of --\no-of the Germans. It was few actions. It was -- one I remember was terrible, it was when we live\non Zamar Stenowska 124, that it wa -- they call this August aktion. It was a few days, I think\nfrom the beginning of the August, like -- like a -- the whole -- the whole week. And they were\ngoing from apartment to apartment, whoever were -- was in apartment, ta -- ta-taking the people\nout, and kill them on the spot, or -- or send them 1-in for th-the concentration camp or other\nplace, t -- t-to killed on the way to concentration camp. And it -- it was a -- the terrible -- the\nJews w-were divided in -- 1-in the ghetto for two -- t-two group of people, the people who work\nduring the day, and the people who were working during the night. And th-th -- they used to\nwork in the Janowska camp. It was a labor camp that the people were working for the German\ncompany. My mother was working there, and she was sewing the -- the uniforms for th-th -- for\nthe Germans. The people who were working during the day, they had the letter R. The people\nwho were working during the night had the letter W. And, for example, in the aktion in th -- in\nAugust, e -- 0 -- everyb-body who had the letter R, had to be taken out and killed. And n-n-next\ntime, in the other aktion, 1t h-happened that the people who were wearing W stay, and the R -- o-\nopposite -- th-the W, th-they were supposed to be -- be taken out a-and killed. And this was\ngoing on every -- every di -- f-few weeks or few months, sometimes. You never knew the -- th-\nthat will h-happen. It was a -- one aktion that they did th- the -- to kill the -- a-all children.\nWherever they found a kid, they kill him and is -- on the spot [indecipherable] or th-the kid was\nsmall, they took them by the legs and hitting with h-his head th-the -- the building wall, and --\nand throwing on the -- on the lorry. I-I-I -- it -- all the time w-we have to hide. And a-all the time\nmy father used to build some hiding places for us. And he -- he had such a -- a -- an -- he was\nsuch entrepreneur, and he had a really genius when he was finding places, and built for -- for us\nto hide. One of the place that I remember, it was a -- a under the window ledge. He -- he -- in\nEurope they build thi-this way, that the window, under the window ledge you -- you have a space\nbe-between the -- the bricks. And he put a -- a -- a artificial wall and he camouflaged the wall,\nand it was a space maybe to -- width, it was maybe one foot, and maybe length it was like four\nfeet. And we were sitting there with my brother on the potties, he -- he gave us two potties in\ncase we have to go. We were sitting there and he ca -- ca -- bent completely, like you know, like\nhe -- the babies 1-in the mo-mother\u2019s womb -- womb, and h-he used to lock us there, and then put\na table in front o-of this. And we were sitting there, a-and waiting til he will come back and he\nwill free us from there. I -- I remember that this was the wor -- this was the -- the worst time for\nme. I was so scared, and I used to cry and I -- my brother used to cry and we were holding hands,\nand -- but we were cry -- crying -- only the tears were -- were pouring through our cheeks. We\nwere -- they were silent tears. And -- because we were afraid that somebody can hear it that we\nare crying. And I used to always tell my brother, it will be okay, it will be okay, don\u2019t worry. At\nleast my brother had me, that I could tell him d-don\u2019t worry, but I didn\u2019t have anybody who was\nholding me and saying don\u2019t -- don\u2019t worry at that time. And th -- this is the -- during the whole\nwar, I think that this was the -- one of the worst thing that I went through, hiding in -- in those\nplaces and waiting for my father to come and to free us fr-from this.",
        "Q: Well, were you -- were you very aware at that time of people being killed, and what was\nhappening after these round-ups?",
        "A: At that time that we started to live in ghetto, I was ev -- aware of everything what\u2019s going on.\nI saw people killed, I saw people murdered. I saw people be -- be y-you know, hitting by the\nGermans, by the Ukrainians, and 1-1-1 -- 0 -- 0 -- on this place that we live in Zamar Stenowska\n124, once I went to the -- we had the -- like a ba -- small backyard there, and I went there and I\nh-heard some kind of noise, si -- so-some noise that -- like s-s-some -- [tape interruption]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Like I's -- I said when we were living in Zamar Stenowska, and the -- I -- I was o-outside for -\n- for awhile 1-in the backyard and I heard -- 1-it was a fence backyard, and I heard some like a g -\n- cries, a-and the voices of -- 0-of people, and the sounds of hitting and I looked through the hole\nin -- 1-1n the fence, and I saw like th-three or four Ukrainian boys hitting like with baseballs,\nhitting -- 1t -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t baseball, but something si-similar, and they were hitting a Jewish\nman and he was crying and asking for them to stop, and I couldn\u2019t do anything. I run upstairs to\nmy mother and I said what\u2019s going on, she said, you can\u2019t do anything. We -- we cannot -- you\nshouldn\u2019t even be outside. It -- I-I saw so many things that I have those pictures always with me\nand they are coming suddenly, that I even expect to -- to see like a f-flashbacks f -- in -- in my\nmemories. Sometimes I have, during the dreams that I have, I see th-th-tho -- tho-those faces,\ntho-tho -- I hear those voices. I-It was -- it was terrible for a kid my age to see so terrible things\nhappen to -- to other people. But I wasn\u2019t a child any more, I was already a grownup. I had a -- I\nwas more like a -- a animal, I have those instincts, that I knew that I have to hide, that I knew\nthat I have to run and this is probably what saved ma -- my life, because one of the aktion I was\nwith my cousin, and I saw the German coming, I said to her, run, and we were both running. I\nwas the faster one and I hide, she didn\u2019t and she was taken. And she -- she was taken and to the\nconcentration camp a-a-and -- and killed. It\u2019s -- and I-I knew how to make a di-di-diff -- how to\ndifferentiate -- to make a difference between footsteps. I kn -- I could recognize the footsteps of\nthe German a-and not Germans. And I knew w-when I have to hide when I was left alone\nbecause most of the time I was alone, my mother was working in the Janowska labor camp, my\nfather was working like a carpenter in the ghetto, and I was left alone with my brother. S-\nSometimes I -- when I heard the -- the footsteps and I knew that they are Germans, I -- I grab my\nbrother and I put him to a suitcase that -- I push -- close the suitcase and I push under the -- th-\nthe bed, and I by myself was hiding in the corner of the room behind my mother robe -- a night\nrobe that was ha-ha -- it -- it -- he -- he was til the floor, I knew that I can maybe hide there --\nthere, but I made sure that my feet will be back, that the German couldn\u2019t see maybe in my -- my\nfeet standing out from the end of the -- of -- of the robe. And when the German left, th-they --\nthey went usually, they checked every -- they checked and they didn\u2019t see the kids, they left and I\nwas waiting a few -- another few seconds to make sure that they are not coming back and then I\nrun to open the suitcase and let my brother out because I was afraid that he will suffocate. This\nwas one of my hiding places that I foun -- found.",
        "Q: How long would that last, or how long would your brother be in a suitcase like that?",
        "A: It would take few minutes, because you know that they would -- th -- the doors -- you were\nnot allowed to lock the doors. The lo -- the doors had to be open in -- in the ghetto. They could\ncome, I remember that, that they opened the door, and they do -- went inside and they started to\ncheck, you know, they didn\u2019t check the suitcase now and they didn\u2019t check with -- luckily be-\nbehind my mother robe. And -- and they -- it took few -- few minutes, maybe two, three minutes,\nbut I was scared already, I knew I was so ] -- that I -- he won\u2019t have enough oxygen -- a-air to\nbreathe, that I have to o-open the suitcase.",
        "Q: Was your brother terrified? He was younger and probably didn\u2019t understand or know as much\nof what was happening?",
        "A: He was such a good child. He knew that --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number two, side A. You were telling me about your brother.",
        "A: Yeah, my brother, he -- he knew that he -- he cannot cry, and he -- he was li -- li-like --\nprobably like animal like me too, you -- you know? He -- he knew that I -- if I am saying you\nhave to go to the suitcase, he -- he never th-th -- questioned this. He -- he -- he knew that I am\ntrying to -- to save his life. He was aw-aware of everything what\u2019s going on. He was little boy,\nhe was four years old, but he knew what\u2019s go -- going on exactly.",
        "Q: So, were there other children that you were aware of or even learned about after the fact, who\nwere doing -- you know, hi-hiding like this and surviving like this? Were -- were they actually\nlooking for children during these round-ups, or what were these round-ups about?",
        "A: Most of the -- the round-ups, they were always looking for children, because I remember that\nmy father didn\u2019t let me go out. He said -- and I was only in this room, I didn\u2019t go out -- outside. I\n-- we live in -- 1-in the -- w-we the -- we moved from -- from the Z-Zamar Stenowska. We -- we\nthen -- we live for awhile with my grandfather and then we move to another place, and then we\nwind up 1-in the building, the -- the Wehrmacht was on the ground floor and we live on the first\nfloor -- floor. I -- I -- I think, and I know that some kids were living in this building because I\nremember wa -- one -- one day it was a -- a aktion, that a -- a round-up for the kids. My father, he\nh-hid us, but other kids weren\u2019t so lucky, and they will -- taken out bow th -- by the Germans.\nAnd I remember when th-the -- the mothers, when they came back and they ran to the apartments\nand they didn't see the kids, they were -- they were calling the kids, and the -- the kids weren\u2019t\nthere, and some the -- of them, commit suicide, jumping from the second floor. And I remember\n-- J-I -- I remember the sound on the falling bodies and I ask my mother, what\u2019s the ca -- the\nsound, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me, she said no, I di-di-di -- don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look. But I\nlooked and I saw it. And this wa -- the mother th-that came and didn\u2019t find th-the -- their\nchildren, and they commit suicide. This is how I know that there must be more children living in\n-- in this -- the building that we lived.",
        "Q: So, at what point, and -- and was it -- was it a -- a real change for you when the ghetto was\nthen sealed in or fenced in and -- and what are your recollections around that particular time?",
        "A: I-I-I -- for me it wasn\u2019t s-such a b-big change because I-I -- I -- I was inside all the time right\nnow for -- for awhile already. And I knew I have to hide, and I knew that from time to time my\nfather was hiding in -- as -- there. Then once he -- he built a -- a bunker 1-1-1n the basement of\nthis building and h-he -- he hid us there and then the German found out about the place because\nsomebody told him that my father 1s hi-hi-hidding th-the -- the kids, the family, because my\nmother was there too. And th-th-they started to -- to rip the -- the wall that my f-father b-built,\nand we -- we came out and th-they started to hi-hit us and then my father s-started to beg the\nGermans t-to leave us alive, and th-th-they did, and they ask him who build this, he said that he\nbuilt it, they ask him why you build it. Because I want to save my family, those are my children\nand my wife, and they started to hit him and I remember that the -- like the blood was dr-\ndripping from my father face and my f-father head. A-A-And then my -- my mother, she had the\nwatch, and she -- she gave this to the Germans. She -- she tried to bribe them, and th-th -- th-then\nh-he said, th-the one of the German, oh-oh -- okay. Th -- one kids can stay, one kids will go and\nhe -- they told my mother and my father to choose which one will stay, which one will go. And\nmy father took from his pocket picture of me and my brother together, and he said, those are my\ntwo kids. I can\u2019t make the different, who will go and wh-who will stay. Please let them s -- both -\n- both of them stay. And s-somehow I-I think that my father gave it to him his watch, and\nsomehow he said, okay, [speaks German here] he said, in German. And we -- we stayed there,\nbut we were afraid if we will go upstairs to our apartment that the other German will come or the\nUkrainians will come and they will take us. And my mother s-sa -- ask him to go with us to the\napartment. He went with us to the apartment and he stayed and he -- my mother ask him if he\nwants something to eat, if he -- h-he -- he wants eier with -- he said eier with zwiebeln, eggs and\nonions. And my mother made for him tho-those eggs. She started, you know, t-to say -- to keep\nhim busy, to stay as long as -- as he can. And th-this way we -- we -- we stay alive. It was a pure,\npure luck. I -- I -- I can\u2019t -- I-I -- I -- I don\u2019t know ho-how to explain this, that so many thousands\nwent and we stayed.",
        "Q: Do you think it -- it made a big difference, it helped that -- that your family did have some of\nthe financial resources from -- from the earlier days? These kinds of incidents, do you think that\nhelped a great deal?",
        "A: An -- absolutely. If you had -- at that time it was very important to make some jewelry, some\nvaluable things to -- to bribe the Germans, to bribe the Ukrainians, because th-th -- even if the\nGerman lets you go, the Ukrainian didn\u2019t. And th-th-this was a main commodity at that time.\nAnother ca -- ta -- commodity that was very valuable in that time, it was the cyanide. It -- it -- th-\nth-this is the toxin, you know, that y-you take to commit su-suicide.",
        "Q: Oh, cyanide?",
        "A: Cyanide, cyanide, yes. And my mother, she always have with her, three vials, small, t-tiny\nvials, one for her and one fo-for each of her child because she said that the German will -- will\nnot take us alive. And my father, probably he had one too.",
        "Q: Did you know that she had that at the time?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know. I di -- I -- I only find out wa -- once, when one of the fi -- fi -- fi-fi -- th-that --\nthat I-I fi-figured it out once when one of the vial -- ma -- my mother broke and th-then I figure it\nout that sh-she has it. But this was her -- she always said that she -- the German will not get us\nalive.",
        "Q: At that age did you think much about death? As in your own possible death at that time?",
        "A: I was always, you know, afraid of death. This is why I developed this instinct and knowledge\nhow to hide myself, and to hide my brother because I was scared. I was scared that I will be dead\n-- that I will die. And I was scared that my parents will die and I will stay alone, and then I will\ndie. It was -- it was the whole process that was going in -- in -- in my head.",
        "Q: So I\u2019m not sure if -- if there\u2019s a -- a difference, or if you want to just talk about what kind of\nwork your father was still able to do, and was there a difference between when the ghetto was\nnot yet sealed and when it was sealed?",
        "A: It -- 1-1-1t was -- he was a cam -- a carpenter, he was responsible for -- for all the repairs 1-1-in\nthe ghetto and for the commander of the ghetto. If something -- if he wanted to build something,\nwant to make something, he -- he -- he build the apartment for -- for himself, 1t -- my father was\nresponsible for -- for this. Yeah, 1t was a terrible job because he was dealing with a crazy person,\nsadist, who was very happy and he fulfilled with happiness when he could kill -- kill the -- the\nJews, and he was looking always to -- for to -- to do something, to -- to cause that my father, that\nhe can kill my father. But unfortunately for him, and fortunately my father, he -- my father\noversmart him.",

        "A: Oh, he didn\u2019t tr-trust at all my father. He -- he used him, he used my father knowledge, my\nfather intelligent and smart that my father w-was, and he was giving him each time different sh --\nchores to do -- do -- to do that he thought is impossible for him to do it, and my father did, and\nhe couldn\u2019t understand how, how he managed to fulfill hi -- his desires, I can say. But he wa --\nhe was a terrible man and my father s-suffered a lot. And --",

        "Q: And there was a close call, do you remember when it happened, with your father and him,\nright?",
        "A: Yeah, my father was bi-building fo-for him his apartment and he told -- he gave him a -- an --\na hour when it has to be finished, date and hour when it h-has to be f-finished. And my father and\nthe -- th-th-the employee there, th-they were painting and they finish on the time, but th-th-the --\nthe -- the paint was still wet, and he went with his finger and he find out that the -- the paint is\nwet, and he said to my father, come on. And in the main platz, he -- he-he-he put like a -- a set --\nlike a footstep and h-he -- he -- he took my father and my father on hi-hi-his way to the -- t-to the\nma-main market, to the pla -- platz, he -- he said s -- something -- somebody was passing and he\n-- h-he said, tell my family to -- to -- to run. And th-th-this man came to us and he said to my m-\nmother, take your kids and run because you will be killed. And we run to the next floor, to the\nsecond floor, to somebody -- to -- to somebody who lived there and we were watching through\nthe window and my mother was holding my -- my brother in her arms and my brother said,\n\u201cMama, Mama, look. They are going to hang somebody.\u201d Because he -- he saw the rope, and th-\nthe pantel, you know, that -- that you hang people. And -- and my -- and ma-ma -- and my\nmother said to him, don\u2019t -- don\u2019t watch, and sh-she turn him around and he didn\u2019t know that th-\nthe rope was prepared to hang my father. He -- he says to my father, ta-ta-take the clothes off,\neverything from the pocket [indecipherable] a-and put it, the rope, around the neck of my father,\nand my father was -- he was sure that that\u2019s it, this is his last second o-of his life. And he looked\nto -- to my father, and h-he was perspiring, you know, he was -- he -- he probably was half of\nconscious already, and he said to -- he looked -- he look, he wait, and then he said to -- to my\nfather, go. They took the rope and my father was running like this, he -- he -- he was half\nconscious. And he called my father back and he -- my father said okay, he is playing wi-with me\na game, you know, cat, the mouse, he will hang me now. But he said to -- to my father, why are\nyou running with your pen -- penis out? Because my father didn\u2019t put his clothes on. He run like\nthis. And this was -- he was a sadist. He was a sadist.",
        "Q: And you saw that?",
        "A: And I saw this. I was looking through the window and I saw this. Yeah, it -- 1-it 1s terrible.",
        "Q: Once the ghetto was sealed, were you in the same apartment then, consistently, or were you\nstill moving around?",
        "A: We still were moving around from place, but this was the -- the building, this was the last\nplace. From this building we escaped to the -- to the sewer.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the address? Do you know the address of that place?",
        "A: I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know the address.",
        "Q: But that was somebody else\u2019s apartment at one point that you moved into. Is that how that\nworked?",
        "A: It -- it was a building. I -- I think it was like a semi-round bi -- building that had a t-two or\nthree floors, and they had a -- outside in the back it has a -- a court -- it was a big courtyard, and\nentrance to the apartments were from the back -- 1-it was like a balcony is go a-around the\nbuilding, and the entrance to the apar-apartment was from those ba-balconies. This is -- this is\nthe type of building that you have in Europe, that you have th-the -- the bild -- big backyard --\nhow you call it -- and then the entrances from the apartments are coming fro-from the balconies\ni-1n the -- in the back. And they used to, when they did the aktion they used to keep the people in\nthis backyard, behind th-th-th-the building. And from there they were t-taking the people to the I-\nlorries.",
        "Q: What did you eat during this phase? What were you able to eat and how hungry, you know,\nwere you, often?",
        "A: M-Mostly I remember what we were eating, it was bread, it was the dark bread, a round loaf\nof bread. Sometimes my father gets some milk for -- for my younger brother. Some soup that my\nmother cook when she came home from work. Not -- I don\u2019t remember eating any -- a-any meat\n[indecipherable] sometimes eggs. We had the somebody from the outside of the ghetto, you\nknow, people were smuggling things for -- for money, th-th-th-they -- they b-bought things from\n-- from Christian who were a-around the ghetto, that they live around the ghetto, and you can\nsm-smuggle sometimes. A-And this is what we ate. I -- I think that we probably we-were so\nscared that we didn\u2019t feel that we are hungry. I don\u2019t remember feeling hungry there in ghetto\nthat I felt I -- I didn\u2019t have food, but I was so scared that probably, you know, suppressed the --\nthe -- the hunger.",
        "Q: During this -- all of this time being in the ghetto, were -- was your family able to observe any\nJewish traditions, any of the holidays in any way?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t remember. We -- we didn\u2019t have any -- my mother used to -- I think sometimes\nused to light Friday night candles. This I remember she had -- that -- that she did when she had\nthe candles, th-that sh-she did this, yeah. Otherwise, I don\u2019t remember when the -- the holy days\ncame, you know, the day was -- each day w-w-was a similar to the next day.",
        "Q: And what, if any, specific memories do you have of -- of your own interactions with any of\nthe Nazis? Did you have any, you know, that you recall during all of these different episodes,\nand -- or were you able to successfully hide and not have any real interaction?",
        "A: I-I-In this building th-that we live on the ground floor, it was Wehrmacht. This is a -- German\nsoldiers. They were different that the Gestapo and the SS, and they used to come to our\napartment and bring some sugar, some chocolate. Sometimes they were hiding in our apartment,\nthey ask my mother to hide this because they were stealing from each other. Sometimes they\nwere giving us something. I remember that one of -- of them, he -- whenever h-he came, he used\nto take me on his -- and I was sitting on his laps, and he was telling my mother that he has a girl\nthe same age that I am. And he used to leave me some sugar, and -- a-and some chocolate. And\nonce I remember th-th-that one of the German of the Wehrmacht, he sa-saved my father because\nI remember he ran to our apartment and he said to my father, run, because the Gestapo 1s coming\nto get you. And my father left and the next second the Gestapo came for my father and his -- they\ndidn\u2019t found him.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s interesting. So they were actually, at least a few of them were somewhat, you\nknow, protective and friendly towards you.",
        "A: Yes, so-some of them, I -- I think you know, it is -- it was a different between the Wehrmacht,\nthe soldiers and the Nazi and the ges -- Gestapo. This was the different, they -- they -- they were\nthe soldiers, they were doing th-the job that they were t-told to do. And some of them had the he\n-- humane, you know, feelings. They have the -- the wives, the childrens, and th-th-they were\ndifferent, they -- th-they weren\u2019t so, so bad like the Nazis.",
        "Q: And as a child did you -- for instance, the one I guess you sat on his lap, did you like him?\nDid you feel comfortable, or were you always sort of scared of any German at this point?",
        "A: I-I became to like him. From the beginning I was scared, but he was coming a f -- a few times\nand I be-begin to like him. I wasn\u2019t so scared from him.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: No, no, no, I don\u2019t remember. I remember hi-his -- how he was built, that he was strong man.\nHe had the young face, he was blonde, and -- but I don\u2019t remember his name.",
        "Q: I just want to go back for a moment cause I remember reading something about your\ngrandfather and what happened to him, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s on your mother\u2019s side, or your\nfather\u2019s side.",
        "A: On my father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: It\u2019s your -- it is your father\u2019s father, then, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And this is when your father ran after him?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. This was al --",
        "Q: And when did this happen?",
        "A: I think it was \u201942. Or -- \u00b042 or \u201943, I don\u2019t remember ex -- exactly the year.",
        "Q: You were in the ghetto, or --",
        "A: We were in the ghetto. We used to leave -- we move already from Zamar Stenowska, from\nanother place, and it was becoming smaller and we used to live together with my grandparents, 1-\nin one -- in one room. And one day my grandpa -- father came, and he said to my father that -- p-\npack your things a-and run. And my father said, what does it mean, run? He didn\u2019t want to go.\nHe di -- they were discussing why he has to go and my grandfather said, because tomorrow\nmorning they will come and they will take you -- me, and they will kill me. And my father didn\u2019t\nwant to believe it, but my grandfather force him. He -- he said only to me that I will sing him a\nsong, the lul -- lullaby that I used to always sing to him, and he gave -- he took h-his watch that\nhe had in the pocket, the round one, and he gave it to my father and he said that he has to go. My\nfather was fighting with him, but the end he -- he pushed my father. My mother grab only small\nbottle of milk, grab my brother an-and we run. And I remember it was night, and we were going,\nand my mo-mother, she stepped on so-something, she fell, and she broke th-the -- the milk fo-for\nmy brother and my father was very unh-unhappy, he said now we will -- won\u2019t have milk to feed\nhim. And this was the last time that I saw my grandfather and my grandmother, because the next\nday in the morning, they came, they took them, and they took them to someplace. And my father\nwas following them. He was hiding behind th-the trees and following and he was standing\nbehind the tree, and he saw when they s-shot my -- my grandfather and my grandmother.",

        "A: He -- he came home, he was very depressed, of course, what he saw, but my father, he didn't\nlose the belief that he can save us. His 0 -- whatever he di -- the purpose o-of his -- him staying\nalive was to save his family, and he constantly was working how to do it, how to find the place\nthat he can hide us, that he can spare us f-f-from being killed.",
        "Q: So, before we -- I think we\u2019re almost ready to start talking about the plans for your family to\nescape, but before that, I just wanted to ask, were you aware of deportations taking place from --\nfrom the ghetto? What was your awareness as a child of -- of these sorts of things, or where\npeople were being taken, or did you hear much about -- about that?",

        "A: When we live in ghetto in th-this -- in our last apartment, I didn\u2019t know anything about the\nescape that my father was planning. But I remember one evening h-he came and he said to -- to\nmy mother, p-pack the things and dress u -- dress us up, that we have to leave. And my mother\nput on me my green sweater, a-a-and a coat, and she put so many things on -- on me, and I ask\nher, wh-why are you dressing me so warm? And she said, you know, the place that you will go,\nyou need warm dresses. And I was fighting with her because she wanted to put boots on my feet,\na-and I said no, I -- I want sandals. I-It was -- you know, it was June. And she said no, you\ncannot wear sandals, you have to w-wear boots. Then -- which -- sh-she took us, and my fa -- my\nfather took us to an -- in the ghetto there were few barracks. In -- in one of the barracks -- and we\nwent to a basement in this barracks, I remember th -- that it was so dark, and s-so, you know,\nspooky and -- and we -- we stayed there 1n this -- this place, and even in this place, I remember\nthat it was a hiding space that my father prepare for a -- us to hide if the German were -- were\ncoming. It was like a second wall he built, a second wall, and we were hiding be-behind thi-this\nwall. And then I-I don -- I remember they were se-se -- they were going behind this wall, and\nthey were digging something and digging and we stayed, we didn\u2019t go back to our apartment and\ndi -- we stay in this basement, we stayed there maybe two or three weeks, something like this.\nAnd we -- w -- we couldn\u2019t lay down, we were all -- always sitting there and my mother was\nholding us, and one night I-I -- I remember th-that we were sitting and suddenly, you know, like\nfrom the ground some face came, sa -- wa -- big face with beautiful smile, beautiful teeth, blue\neyes, coming and smiling at -- at us, and I -- y-you know, we were shocked. Who -- who is it?\nAnd then my father introduced him who he 1s, and this was Socha. He --",
        "Q: What\u2019s his full name?",
        "A: Leopold Socha. And he came -- he introduced himself and my father said that this is his wife\nand two children, and this is how we met Socha. And then few days later, I remember it was a\nbig commotion, people were running and screaming and my father came and said, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s\ntime w-we have to go. And we went to this opening in the floor o-o-of the basement and I saw a\nbig hole, dark. And my father said, go there. I said, I can\u2019t, Iam not going. And he went and then\nI didn\u2019t want to go, and I think my mother or somebody else push me, and he grabbed me down,\nhe grabbed me, and I heard -- the moment I went there, I ca-came down, I heard this noise of\nfalling water. And it was so scared, this rushing water u -- and the darkness, and the smell. And I\nask my father, where are we, where are we going? He said, don\u2019t worry. Stick to me, stick to me,\ndon\u2019t -- don\u2019t worry. And then my brother came, and my mother, and this is how we started our\nlife in -- in the sewer th-that we went down. It was a -- a lot of people, commotion, because\npeople what -- were coming fr-from th-the manholes around th-the ghetto. They were coming to\nthe -- to the sewers. I-I-It was -- 1t was terrible. It was like going to hell.",
        "Q: How was your father able to plan for this? Do you know now sort of what -- what happened,\nin -- in brief -- you know, even though you didn\u2019t know at the time, but how did he plan for this?",
        "A: Yeah I -- no-now I -- I know, he planned -- we -- he met with the -- like I said that he -- he\nwas the carpenter, and responsible, he had the crew, people working. One of the crew, it was\nBerestitsky, Jacob. He was a [indecipherable] and a religious man. And my father k-k-keep him,\nyou know, to -- to work for him, and Berestitsky approached my father and said, \u201cHeger, I know\nthat you are building and building those hiding places, but you ha -- you -- you will not succeed.\nIn the end they will kill you and kill your family.\u201d And they started to think about where you can\nhide, and they came to a plan that 1-in the sewer. And my father remembered the sewer because\nwhen it was built -- because it was a river, Peltew. And because of the stench and the -- you\nknow, the hygiene, the -- th-they decided in the municipality in the early 900, they decided, you\nknow, that they have to cover this. And they used -- my father was little when he was going and\nwatching the -- the people who are working there. They -- the Italian POW\u2019s were building this,\nbecause it was Galicia that\u2019s time, you know, different politics, different -- and they were\nbuilding this and my fa-father remembered how they built, he -- he -- he remember how it look\nlike. And they came to a p-plan, you know, that t-to -- to -- to maybe, you know, to find a place.\nAnd they started to dig, they were digging from this basement, then they came down. When they\ncame down, they -- they saw a light from a lamp, and th-three people came to them and they ask,\nwhat are you doing here? They were sewer workers, that they, y-you know, k-k-keep control of\nthe sewers if everything is normal -- 1-in order working, you know, in order. They keep the -- the\nmaintenance of the sew -- maintenance worker. And my father said to him, you -- you know, I\u2019m\nlooking for place to hide my family from the Germans. Now he started to laugh, and th-th-they\nwere starting to talk, and then he -- he sa -- he said he wants to do what he did and he look and\nhe said, it is not so bad, but y -- w-we can help you, but if -- for a pay -- payment. And he\nmentioned some amount of money, it was a big amount of money. And my father said to him,\nokay, I will bring you tomorrow. And when w -- they came to the basement, you know, th-th-\nthey -- few people were involved in this, it was Berestitsky, it was Weiss, and some his friends,\nand Weiss s-said to my father that he is stupid that he agreed to pay him so much money. And\nmy father said, what else can I lose? I-I have to try. And next day he came back and he gave to --\nto -- to Socha money, and Socha wanted -- then Socha came up to the basement, and this is when\nI saw him. And then later on he said when we were 1-in -- in the sewer sitting, he said that he\ndecided to save us when he saw my mother sitting with those two children. And he said, I saw\nthis picture, it looked like a chicken with the hands. And this is when I decided that I will sa --\ntry to save you. And --",
        "Q: Was your -- would you characterize your father then as an optimist? You know, y-y -- all\nthese terrible things are happening and then this idea that he would give a lot of money to\nsomeone he barely knows. Do you think you would think of your father then as just -- I mean,\nobviously very determined, but do you think he was generally very optimistic?",
        "Q: He -- he -- he was optimistic per-person, but he was too, very determined, and he didn\u2019t, you\nknow, lose the -- the believing that he can save us. He -- he -- he grab everything what can d --\nhe -- he grabbed, only to -- to save us. And he was person who -- who t -- took risks. Because I --\nif my father wouldn\u2019t take risk, we wouldn\u2019t be alive, because it was during the -- you know, the\nghetto time, it was so many times that he t-took risk, and I-I-I -- and he stay alive, that I-I-I-I -- I\n-- | don\u2019t -- sometimes you know, I\u2019m thinking and I don\u2019t know what is -- is it, 1t was a luck?\nMost of the t -- of the time I think it was luck that -- that we are alive. I-I don\u2019t know. My mother\nbelieve in something else. She believed it -- it was a f -- the omen from -- from a high power that\nWe S -- we -- we were chosen to -- to stay av -- stay alive. Maybe she is ri -- she was right, I don\u2019t\nknow. But my father was ve -- he was optimistic I can say, because I cannot say that somebody\nwho will be, you know, very pessimist and depress, h-he would give up mu -- much early.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how much money your father wound up paying Socha?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how much money he gave him from the bi -- when he went down, but it must be\nbiv -- a -- a lot of money because wi -- Weiss was screaming a lot. That\u2019s why I think it was a lot\nof money. And they -- and they -- we -- he agreed to pay him every day, 500 zlotys. 500 zlotys at\nthat time, it was probably even 200 dollars each time. You know, each day when he came, he --\nhe was buying food for this, and then wa -- what\u2019s stay, it was for -- for him.",
        "Q: And your father was able to save a lot of money somewhere without, obviously the Nazis --\nthe Germans finding his resources.",
        "A: I -- I think so because otherwise how -- how he would have? I think that one of the hiding\nplaces that my father built, tha-tha -- I think he kept th-the money and he kept the jewelry.\nBecause later we -- we paid with jewelry, too.",
        "Q: So now, going back to when you first enter the -- the sewers, tell me just how old are you at\nthis stage, and how many other people are joining you in this first rush into the sewers? And is\nthis right about the time when the liquidation is happening?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me what\u2019s going on in the ghetto.",
        "A: This -- this was, I think end of May, May 30 or beginning o-of June, that 1t was a liquidation\nand this is why the people started to run and be run t-to -- to th -- to the sewer. And this was in\n1943, the beginning of June 1943, and I was at that time, I was like seven and half, yeah, and my\nbrother was f-four years old. And a-at that time, and d-during this panic, lot of people came\ndown. I don\u2019t know if lot of people came down through our entrance. I think that -- more that\nthey thought because people find out that this is an entrance. But lot of people came from the --\nfrom the manholes. And th-th-th-then 1-it was s-s-such a y-y-you know, screaming and yelling\nand th-th-th-th-the falling water, and th-the echo. It-It-It sounded so terribly, and you -- you\nknow, the ledge that we were walking, it was maybe one foot wide, and we had to walk, we had\nto -- with our back to the walls, and slide, you know? But from the beginning when we went\ndown, I remember that my father -- I was -- h-he was holding me on his back and my mother was\nholding my brother, and this is how we walked. Then I ask him constantly where are were going,\nwhere are we going, and he -- he co-constantly wa-was you know, telling me, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t\nworry, you will be okay. Wa -- and we pa -- we had to pass on the other side o-of the river, and I\nwas so scared, there was such a -- a narrow passage I-like a bridge, small narrow bridge, and I\nwas so scared. We passed to the other side. Somehow we wind out 1-1n the one of the branches of\nth-th-this sewer, looked like a cave. A-And so many rats, a-a-and, you know, the stench, 1-1-1-it\nwas t -- a-a-and the w-w-w -- webs of the -- the spider webs. Wherever we -- we went we had to\npush the spiderwe-webs aside. It was terrible. And we stayed there, 1-it was lot of people, I think\nmaybe some 70 or something. Lot of people there, a-and then after Socha came and sh -- he ju --\nhe took a group only of people because he couldn\u2019t, you know, support -- he took like I think 21\npeople, and we went to different cave, and we were sitting there for -- for long time, I -- I think\nmaybe two or three weeks, or maybe longer.",
        "Q: And where is this -- you know, most of us haven\u2019t obviously been in a sewer system, so\nwhere is the sewage? You\u2019re sitting in this cave --",
        "A: And o-on the -- on the floor, the sewage, it -- you -- you -- and the waste is coming on the\nfloor of the --",
        "Q: Right beside you the whole time?",
        "A: Right. Right where you are sitting. This is like a, you know, sewers -- yo-you think that this 1s\na big place, that there were -- th-this was a sew -- no, no, not -- 1-it was a -- like a pipes. And\nsome of them were very narrow, had like 40 centimeters, it\u2019s like three feet. And si -- you know,\nthe height, or sa -- you-you have to s -- s -- when we were trying to get to the -- the bigger one,\nyou have to go through the branches of the small one, you have to crawl on your s -- knee, and\non your elbows. You have to go miles and miles this way, and th -- you know, in the --\neverything is -- is flowing, and you are 1-1n, trying to get to the destination where you -- you have\nto go. I-It was unbelievable.",
        "Q: Were you complaining as a -- as a young child in your first encounters with the actual sewage\nflowing by, were you complaining at all? Or were you aware that this was your, you know,\npossible escape for freedom?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t complaining. I -- I -- I was s-scared. I was very scared but I didn\u2019t complain because\nI -- you know, I believe in my father, and I thought that he said I have to go there, that I have to\ngo there, no complaints. And we were sitting in this one -- space 21 of [indecipherable] we got\nvery sick. We got dysentery, we were very weak, we didn\u2019t have water to drink. My father used\nto go miles on his knees and elbows and he was keeping a teakettle in his teeth and he was\nwalking like this, he f-found this place when the -- drinking water from a fountain, in the main --\nmain market in Lvov. Was dripping from the statue, the statue of Neptune. And he found this\nwater and he was bringing, and he wa -- the water for us, and we have like a -- and he divided th-\nthis, we divide like th-three quar-quarter of a -- a -- of a cup, you know, for th -- each person for\nthe whole day. And my parents didn\u2019t drank -- didn\u2019t drink, they gave us this water because we\nwere s-so sick. And then from this place after -- some people left because they couldn\u2019t take it.\nThey said they -- they -- they can\u2019t take it, they left. But the moment, you know, they -- they left\nout sight the -- the sewer, they were killed, and from the whole group, I think we -- we -- it was\nlike 11 people that we stayed there, and then we were -- discovered where another sewer\nmaintenance worker, he came from the manhole because the manhole was leading to the place\nthat we were sitting and we had to run from this place. We run from this place and we -- we met\n-- Socha was coming to -- with the food and he saw us running and he took us to a different\nplace. And we changed the places few times because it was -- some of them were so cold and so\nterrible that we couldn\u2019t s-stay there. And finally we -- we-we wind up in a place that when w-\nwe crawl in, Socha ask my mother, \u201cWhat do you think Mrs. Heger, what do you think about this\nplace?\u201d And my mother said, \u201cOh, Mr. Socha, this is a palace.\u201d And this is -- there in this palace,\nwe stay to the end, to the el-el-el-el-liberation.",
        "Q: Can you describe then what that looked like a little bit more?",
        "A: I-I-I-It -- it -- it was a branch o-of -- one of the branches o-of the sewer, but relatively 1-1t was\nhigh because -- we could stand, we children would stand up, but my parents couldn\u2019t stand up,\nthey have to bend. That\u2019s meaning it was probably like five feet high and the width was maybe\nfive or six feet. And it -- it was a main one and it had -- from this main branch it was a -- like L\nsha -- it was like a L shape. It was entrance to another compartment that was more or less the\nsame s-size, and th-this is ho-how it -- it looked like, but comparing to the other places, it really\nlooked like a palace.",
        "Q: And still the sewage is flowing by here as well?",
        "A: This -- this was a side one. It didn\u2019t have a sewage flowing. It has only manhole that came --\nthat the raining water was coming, but not the -- the sewage wa-wasn\u2019t there. It was mud --\nmuddy -- lot of [indecipherable] and a lot of -- lot of -- no -- rats. And --",
        "Q: Were you scared of them?",
        "A: From the beginning we were scared, but then we played with them, like you -- you play with\nthe dog, with a cat, we play with a -- with the rats. We were watching them, what they are doing.\nThey are very smart. Very smart animals. Yeah, and y-you can get used to th -- everything.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t bite you?",
        "A: Th-They try, you know, from the beginning and my father -- but then they got used to us and\nwe got to used to -- to them, they didn't bite us. The only thing what they -- they used to bite 1s\nour food, our bread. And we -- my -- my father and the rest of the people, they -- they s-s-stood\nguard -- guards, you know, with the sticks and constantly chasing th-them to -- to save our -- our\nfood from them.",
        "Q: Now you said that this became a group of 11.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you remember all the names, or the individuals who make up that group of 11?",
        "A: Y-Yeah. It was a -- a -- a g -- Mrs. Weinber -- Weiss. She was the old wo -- woman. She was\na mother of Weiss who went with us and he left outside because he said he cannot take it, and he\nleft his mother. And it was Helena, and Mondek, and Clara and Mrs. Weinberg, and Haskell, and\nmy mother my father, my brother and me, I think is 10. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was your uncle also with you? Is he one of those?",
        "A: My uncle escaped to the sewer with us. He -- he was with us in the first place that we stay and\nhe w-went to -- to fetch the water, and -- and then a -- it -- storm came and he -- he -- he drown\nin the sewer. Yeah, he never came back.",
        "Q: So it was quite a rushing flow?",
        "A: Oh yes. It -- it was very dangerous because if you crawl in those pipes, you with your body 1s\nalmost closing the -- the pipe. And when the water is coming [indecipherable] racing very fast.\nAnd you -- you don\u2019t have time to escape.",
        "Q: Did you almost fall at any time?",
        "A: I -- I ti -- when we were crawling, I-I -- a few times I -- I -- I-I fall to -- to the water and I get,\nyou know, injure with the -- I stepped on -- on the pin, and the pin went through my foot, but I --\n1-1-1t was okay.",
        "Q: So, what -- what was the routine -- and I think there are two others besides Socha --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- so if you can tell me about them and what was the daily routine with y -- those who were,\nyou know, helping you, these -- these sewer workers.",
        "A: Th -- it was three sewer workers. It was Socha, Wrobleski and Kowaliw. Kowaliw wi -- he\nwas the m-m-maintenance li -- he was on the head of the maintenance group. He -- he stayed\nalways on the street. He was a wa -- the watch person. He watch for anything suspicious and\ndangerous that can happen. And Wrobleski and Socha, they were coming every day with the f-\nfood supply. And the food supplies, y-you know, they had two hand -- handbags in that -- in that\nthey had food and then they covered this with the -- the li-like maintenance, you know --",
        "Q: Tools?",
        "A: Tools, maintenance tools to -- to cover the -- the food in case somebody tell them to open th-\nthe -- the handbag, you know. And it\u2019s -- m-m-mostly what -- the food what we have is -- was\nbread. It was some, you know, kasha, this is like a grains that we can cook, like barley and es --\nsometime some -- y -- some kind of a -- a -- y-you know, of a fat or something to -- but in -- n-n-\nnothing -- nothing -- mostly it was bread.",
        "Q: Were you hungry a lot?",
        "A: We -- we were -- you know, we were dividing. They -- they couldn\u2019t brings too much, but we\nwere dividing. We ate like three times a day. In the morning it was piece of bread, and at coffee -\n- coffee was from chicory, water that looked like coffee, and f-for dinner, Weinbergowa used to\ncook a -- a soup, and soup was from barley, sometimes we had potatoes, and -- and onions, yeah\nonions, he used to bring some onions, and --",
        "Q: Did you ever --",
        "A: -- beans, some beans, fava beans or s-something, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any meat at all while you were down there?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have meat at all, but we children were lucky because when Socha was bringing his\nlunch that his wife made for him from the cold cuts, he used to share with us. He used to give my\nbrother part and me part. And I remember it -- I remember the taste of this meat til now. And it\nwas so delicious, so good, that I used to keep the piece of meat for -- fro-from, you know, the\ncold cuts, and piece of bread, and I was given such a big bite of a bread, and tiny bite from meat\nthat it will stay longer and longer as I ca -- as I can. That -- th-th -- we were lucky, we -- we got\nsome meat, yeah. But the rest of the people --",
        "Q: Sounds like he had a special affection for you and your brother, would you say?",
        "A: Yeah, he -- he really, you know, he loved us, us children, and he -- he had a -- a lot of -- y-y-\nyou know, he -- for my mother he had a lot of like --",
        "Q: Respect?",
        "A: Respect. Respect for my mother. He admire her mo -- my mother, and he admire my father.\nHe -- he -- my father for him was like a guide. Everything what he was supposed to, he always\nask my father if this is okay. Even his private things and he -- he always ask my father. He was\nvery close to my father. And he liked us very much and we like him too. I di -- I treated him like\nmy father. He -- he was -- for me he was an angel.",
        "Q: Did he ever show any signs of sort of the anti-Semitism that so many Polish people grew up\nwith and, you know, sort of had so systematized, you know, as -- as -- you know, did he ever\nreveal that, even at the same time that he was obviously helping you and caring for you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I never, you know, heard anything, and I don\u2019t think so that I never heard\neven later from my parents of a -- no, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about Socha\u2019s background because I think it\u2019s an interesting story,\nbecause maybe partly his background led to this kind of work that he -- you know, this saving\nand rescu --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number three, side A. So we were just talking about Mr. Socha. If\nyou could tell me a little bit more about him?",
        "A: Socha wa-was a v-very interesting person. He -- he was -- when he was young, he -- he was\nan orphaned. And he tried to make his living, you know, when he was a -- a li-little boy and then\nwhen he was t-t-teen [indecipherable] little bit [indecipherable] thiefs. He was a -- a-a thief. He\nwas starting with small things and getting to -- to-to bigger one. He had a -- a -- some\ncompanions who t -- another thiefs that they were working with him and he was caught few\ntimes. I think that he was like three years in the -- in the jail. And he was committing\n[indecipherable] robberies, but he -- he never killed anybody. It was a s -- 1-it was probably only\nto -- to survive, he didn\u2019t know anything else. And he was a very religious man. He was\nCatholic, very religious and I think it was -- it was unbelievable that person like this can change\nso much and save 10 people in such a circumstances, in such a conditions. And I was always\nthinking wh-why he did this and I think that he wanted -- he really was very good person, very\ngood human being, but this was the way he -- he was forced to be brought up, and suddenly he --\nhe met different people and he was very proud of my father because a person like my father, very\nintelligent, very educated person, trust him, give trust, you know, of his -- him and his family t-to\nhi-his hands. And h-he was very proud of this and it changed completely his -- hi-his life. He\nprobably felt right now that he is somebody, that he is not a ti -- a piece, you know, of garbage or\nsomething, that people are pu-pushing away. He -- he found a -- a friend with people of\ncompletely different background, and he was very proud, and besides he -- I think it -- because\nhe was very religion, he wanted to pay for his sins, and he look a-at th-this like kind of\nredemption and this is what I think what -- there were the forces that kept him going and save us.\nAnd he -- he -- he was a great person. For me, I -- I loved him and I still loved him, and when I\nsay kaddish for my parents, I say kaddish for him, too. I-I-It was a -- a great person. A great,\nrighteous person, and we always, the10 of us who survive and the families of 10 of us, we\nalways remember him and his name.",
        "Q: Was he ever named as a Righteous Among the Nations?",
        "A: He is. He is named a Righteous o-of -- th-the Nation. He is in Yad Vashem. He has -- he --\ntrees on his name was planted already like 30 years ago there. He is on the permanent exhibition\nin Yad Vashem. This is a new wing, like now, this is for Righteous People, and he is among\nthem. He, as a matter of fact, I think that the biggest place on the walls is -- is dedicated to -- to\nSocha.",
        "Q: Now how would you characterize the other men who were helping, the other two, I believe\nwho were helping Socha? Were they, you know, as devoted, would you say, to saving you? Or --\nhow would you describe them, their motivations?",
        "A: I -- I would describe them, they were righteous people, you know, and th-th -- they did this,\nbut they were not so devoted, were the -- I can, you know, see, like Socha. He was the machine.\nHe was the brain 0-o0-of us because it came a moment that we didn\u2019t have any more money and\nmy mother was delegated to tell him that we don\u2019t have any more money and Socha said, oh, if\nyou don\u2019t have n-no more money, then we cannot work any more. But he came next day, he\ncame like usual and he brought us food. But I know that he said that the -- Wrobleski and\nKowaliw wanted to stop but he -- he forced them n-no-no-not to -- not to stop and he succeeded.\nHe was y-y-yo -- you know, taking his -- his work that -- to-to -- to the end. He told this is his\nde-destiny and this is what we wanted -- he wanted to accomplish and he did. He was very proud\nof this.",
        "Q: When did you run -- when did your family run out of money? Do you know when that\nhappened while you were down there?",
        "A: I-It was a f-few months before the liberation, yeah, that we runned ou-ou-out of money, that\nwe didn\u2019t have.",
        "Q: And -- and prior to that there was actually another story, I think, about the gold, or the\njewelry?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a-after I think that we stayed there almost a year, only be -- a little bit less. We --\nwe runned out -- ou-out of money, we -- we-we had some jewelry with us that my father was\ngiving him, but we run out of this too. And then my father re-remembered that his aunt, o-or --\ntold -- told him-- a aunt -- I think aunt, that she hid some money in the cellar of her apartment\nthat she used to live, and th -- sh-she tol-told this to my father, and my father m-made the plan,\nhe wrote on piece of paper, he designed the plan of the -- the -- he remembered th-the -- the\nbuilding and the cellar and he told Socha to go there and ma-maybe he can dig and he can find it.\nAnd Socha went there together with ro -- Wrobleski and they said that they are from sewer\nworking, that is some kind of gas leak or something, and they we-were digging and they found\nth-the jewelry. And he -- he -- and the next da-day, we ha -- I remember Socha came, and he --\nhe -- he -- he had the jewelry and he give this to -- to my father. And he said, Mr. Heger, you will\ngive me yi -- like usually, every day little bit. And this is how it happen. Every day my father\nused to give him, like before, certain amount of jewelry or money, and he was taking this in,\nprobably, or selling or -- and then buying a food for us.",
        "Q: And -- and so, right, a lot of money was used not for Socha to get rich necessarily, but to -- to\nbuy the food and the items that you needed, right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What happened after you ran out of money? Was Socha able to afford buying these items for\nyou on his own?",
        "A: He -- he p-paid for on his own for -- for -- for the food. He probably had, you know, some\nmoney because th-the money that we -- my father paid him, it was a lot of money and not\neverything went for buying the food, he probably had, and he used this money t-t-to -- to\ncontinue.",
        "Q: So, if we can go back to describing just a little bit more the conditions of -- of where you were\nliving, and you said that it was under this manhole cover, in this -- this space that you stayed in\nfor a good long period of time, do you know where that is in Lvov? Have you identified where\nthat manhole cover 1s?",
        "A: Yeah, thi -- two years ago I went to Lvov, and I went to places that I remember for -- for --\nthat they were [indecipherable] where I was born, when I live [indecipherable] and where we\nmove from place to place in the gh -- ghetto, I identify each place, and identify the -- the\nmanhole that we were lead -- it was leading to our hiding place, to our palace. And if -- 1s funny\nbecause next to the manhole right now is a coffeshop and th-th-there were table and -- and chairs\nand people were sitting drinking coffee, drinking beer, and below it was a place that we used to\nlive, 14 months.",
        "Q: And at the time you were there, what was above, on the street level right above your manhole\ncover? What was -- what was going on there, do you remember?",
        "A: Yeah, it was a st -- a street. It is a small park next to a church, and 1-1t was a street and a\nsidewalk a-and buildings. And this is where th-th-this is at -- he -- he -- this is -- we -- we were\nsitting under the s-street level.",
        "Q: Could someone open the manhole cover and just see you directly?",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t th-th -- if somebody opens the manhole, he has to go down, then he can see us,\nbecause you go -- 1-1-is a pipe that leads you down and then you have like branch to the side,\nsmaller one that lead -- that will lead you straight to our place. That it was under the angle I-like\n45 de -- 90 degrees angle, th-the -- the branch.",
        "Q: Were there ever any cl -- any close calls like that while you were in that area of -- of people,\nyou know, coming to see you, or -- or accidentally, you know, happening to see you that way?",
        "A: No, in this place, not. I-I -- we only were very ju -- you know -- we ke -- quiet, we kept our\nvoices down, and -- because we could hear, you know, people outside talking, I heard kids\nplaying in the park and -- and y-you know, picking up the flowers and I always ask my -- my\nmother if I will be able one day to go, to be outside and live like the other kids. And my mother\nalways told me, don\u2019t worry, the time will come that you will be among the other kids, and you\nwill pick the flowers, too. And th-this -- we -- we have to, you know, be very careful, because the\npeople c-could hear us. And besides, after, you know, after the liberation when we came down,\nthe concierge from the building that\u2019s -- that\u2019s was next to the -- to the ma-manhole, she said that\nshe was always very surprise because when it was snowing, th-the -- only this place around the\nmanhole, this -- the snow was melting. It was probably from that w-we were cooking. Even that\nsometimes we block -- when we were cooking we used to block the -- the opening, that the smell\nwill not go out, but probably from our body, the heat from our body, that was radiating too, that\nthis -- that the -- it would -- the snow was melting in this place. And she was always very\ncurious, why only in this place the snow is melting?",
        "Q: It certainly seems like such an unusual story. Now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of other\npeople surviving the war and the Holocaust this way in other places, but in Lvov, were the Nazis\nor the Germans thinking about this? Thinking that maybe somebody is down 1n the sewers hiding\nlike this? Do you think it was, you know, on their radar?",
        "Q: I think wa -- from the beginning, were -- when the liquidate the ghetto, they -- they -- they\nknew that people were hiding. In -- 1-in the sewer they thr-throw even some places grenades\nthrough the manholes. But later on, th-th-they, you know, nobody could imagine that so long\nafter the liquidation, you know, people can still survive in the sewer.",
        "Q: Now, besides your intact group of 11 at that stage, were there any other groups that you know\nnow, you know, did also survive this way in those same sewers in Lvov?",
        "A: No, from what I know and I, you know, was interested to -- to find out and I remember my\nfather too was interested, nobody. And Socha told us nobody survive in the sewer. And I don\u2019t\nthink so -- I don\u2019t think that from the whole, you know, surviving stories that I heard, that is\nanother one about the people who survive in the sewer. Maybe for -- f-f-for two, three weeks,\nmaybe in the Warsaw ghetto dur-dur-during the uprisal, maybe, but nobody for such a -- a length\nof period of time survive in the sewer.",
        "Q: When your mother would tell you, don\u2019t worry, your time will come to go outside again and\npick flowers and be outside, did you -- did you keep a high level of hope, or did you get\ndiscouraged? How did you feel, personally?",
        "A: Personally, y-you know, I -- from the beginning I -- I hoped that, you know, that y -- 1-1t --\nsomehow I -- we will stay alive and I -- we will manage to -- to -- to -- you know, to -- to co-\ncome out from this a-and live a normal life, but then I lost already when t-time was passing, I-I --\nI lost th-the hope. I remember that I -- it was a time that I was -- after maybe a year or something\nlike this, I got very na -- depressed. I got very melancholy and depressed, I didn\u2019t want to talk to\nanybody, I didn't want to accept the food, and I was completely, you know, in my -- living in my\no-own world, completely I-losing faith that w -- that we can survive, that I can leave the -- th-the\nse -- the sewer. And 1-it -- it was like a few days, or-or -- or -- or even longer, and then my\nmother didn\u2019t know what to do and he -- she said to -- to Socha what happened, he was very -- he\n-- he -- and, you know, h-h-he was thinking about it and he -- he tried to -- to help me, and he\nwas very worry wh-wh-what happened to -- to me, and he -- he said to me one day\n[indecipherable] he took me with him, he said, come with me and he took me to a si -- place in\nthe sewer, to the -- under the manhole, that I could see the light. And he -- he picked me up, and\nhe -- he said to -- to -- to me, I-look. L-L-Look at the light, and breathe th-th-the air. And he\nstarted to -- to -- to tell me that y-you see, it will come a d-d -- a time you will be outside, you\nwi-will have th-the daylight, and you will li-live like other kids. Well, you have to be patient and\ndon\u2019t yi -- lose your hope. And he -- he took me back and then slowly, slowly, I started, you\nknow, to accept the food, and I started to talk. I-It was like a crisis in my staying there. And 1-1-it\nhappen. We -- we survive.",

And h -- th-\nth -- during s-staying in the sewer, we have a few tragedy th-that happen. Once we have the --\nthe fire, that we thought that we all will be b-burned al-al-alive, and I ask Berestitsky to pray to -\n- to God, and once I remember we have a flood, it was 1-1-1in spring when the s-snow was melting\nand it wa-was terrible hurricane too, and it was so much water then this sew-sewer was filled up\nand we -- th-the water came so high that my mother has to keep us high 1-1 -- up -- up to the\nceiling that we can bre-breathe. And the -- I -- I was sure that this is it, that we will drown there.\nAnd I was asking and begging Jacob to pray, Jacob, pray to God, pray to God. I found it, you\nknow, that this is maybe th-th-the last resource, that we can hold it to -- to stay alive. And\nsuddenly th-th-the waters started to, you know, coming down, and we survive. The next day\nSocha -- Socha came, and he was s-sure that he will f-find only dead bodies there, and h-he said\nth-th-th-this is a miracle that we survive. He -- he went to the church and he light a -- a candle,\nthe thankful candle for -- for us.",
        "Q: How did your brother, you know, go through these kinds of experiences? You -- you had a\ncertain approach, did your brother seem to have the same approach, he\u2019s younger. How did he\nkind of experience things?",
        "A: My brother was younger and he m -- he didn\u2019t remember to -- too much, you know? He got\nused to -- to this. And he thought this is the whole world. This is the sewer and those 10 person,\nand he didn't -- from the beginning probably h-he -- he remembered, but later on -- on, he forgot.\nBecause when we were liberated, and we c-came -- emerge fro-fro-from the -- the sewer and my\nbrother, he started to cry that he wants to go back. He was scared from the people, he was scared\nthat, you know, from the sunlight, from everything. He thought that the life is th-the -- the sewer,\nthe rats, a-and those 10 people. And this 1 -- this is h-how he reacted. He -- h-he -- he -- I think\nmaybe it was better for him that he didn\u2019t remember th-the things. This is why maybe I got\ndepress and he didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: How did the group interact? Are you -- do you want to -- [tape break]. So I wanted to ask you\na little bit about the interactions within the group, if you can tell me, were people getting along\nvery well, were there any problems, and anything notable about some of the individuals you\nwere there with?",
        "A: We were really strange people. Only my mother a-and my father a-an -- and my brother and\nme did -- you know, we were people that we knew each other, I never saw rest of the people ti-til\nwe -- I found myself 1-1-in -- in the sewer. And this -- the people, you know, is like, among the\npeople sometimes you agree on someth -- on something, something, or you disagree. There are\npeople who are more agreeable, you know, who will ge -- get along with everybody else, and\npeople who -- who are not. Most of those people we were very, you know, we got along very\ngood with each other. We had only one, Haskell, who was only -- if you said, this is white, he\nsaid this is black. He was only against, and he -- he was th-the only person that I really di -- was\nafraid of, and I didn\u2019t like it. But re-rest of them was managing, you know, very nicely. We had\nto s-spend our time there, you know, to be 1-in the -- in -- engage in some things, because\notherwise you can go crazy sitting 1-in one place so long. And my father used to write comedies\nand we used to perform, everybody has a role, and perform his -- his part. We used to sing, we\nused to d-do a -- that\u2019s mean the -- the grown-ups, they use -- used to -- especially my father and\nHelena, they used to do puzzles. Puzzles, and they used to play a game that you call\nintelligentsia, that you have one word, and from the letters from this word, you have to make\nnew words. I don\u2019t know if is a name in English for this? And who -- who will make more\nwords, 1-is a winner. And always it was fight between my father and Helena because she claimed\nthat she has more and my father claimed that he has more, and he was telling her to go back to --\nto gymnasia. And he -- he -- you know, we tried to m-make life little bit easier. And m-my\nmother and my father, they used to teach me, you know, ca -- Socha br-brought book, elementar\n-- elementals, they call this. This is when the -- the f-first time you go to school, and you ra --\nwrite ABC and words, and they used to teach me how to write, how to read, and they used to\nteach me ma-math -- mathematics. How to -- to count, you know, add and minus -- plus and\nminus. And to -- to keep me bi -- busy.",
        "Q: How could you see down there? Was it dark?",
        "A: We -- we had a -- a -- you know, a special carbide lamp that was lightening the spa -- it\nwasn\u2019t, you know, very bright, but you -- you could s-see, yeah. And this was ho-how we si --\nwe spent our time, and wa -- oh -- oh -- usually after breakfast that we have that we were waiting\nfor Socha, when he comes and Socha and Wrobleski when they came, it was the -- th-the -- the\nbest time of the day, because we talk, he told us what\u2019s going on. He used to bring sometimes the\nnewspaper for my father, and my father was re-reading the newspaper and then he and Socha --\nmy father was a big general, he was planning the next [indecipherable] you know, move of the\nSoviet army, of American army, of thi -- he was directing the fight 1-1n the sewer. They should\ngo from this side, they should go from this side. And -- and this is ho-how, then it was th-the\ndinner and then we did -- did something, play, and then we had to -- time for cleaning ourself\nfrom the lice. Every di-di-di -- at five o\u2019clock, I think, my mother was taking our di-di -- undress\nus and killing those lices, and put -- lice, and put the dress up. This was another function.",
        "Q: How did she do it? She would -- there would be live lice on you and then she would just kill\neach one?",

        "Q: Did you get lice in your hair?",
        "A: Yes, yes, we -- we had -- but I had very short hair. They kept my hair very short like a -- like\na boy, yeah. I went to the sewer with long, beautiful hair and then they cut it and\n[indecipherable] they grow.",
        "Q: And how was sleeping in the sewer, what was that like?",
        "A: Sleeping, it was another th-thing. We -- we slept on the benches, on the planks, my father\nbuilt from the planks that he found in the -- in other part of the sewer, he -- he built th-th-the --\nthat -- they were supported on the one side of the wall, and on the other side of the wall. During\nthe day he took it -- w-we took this and he -- we made it that we can sit, but for night we pu-put\nthis, and we slept, you know, like three people and three people in the row like this, long ways,\nbecause it was not so wide, it was narrow. I slept between Haskell and my father. I slept right in\nbetween -- it was so tight that if one person wanted to turn around, three has to turn around in the\nsame time.",
        "Q: Would you say you got used to some of these routines in a way, or was -- you know, how\nmuch did this sort of feel like a very strange and difficult way to live, and how much did it feel\nlike an adjustment to a totally different kind of way of life?",
        "A: Is -- if -- with the time, you know, you -- you -- you get used to this. It was the daily routines\nthat we had and we got used to this. We were ha-happy that, you know, that we were alive one\nday, and that we were a -- waiting to another day, and we continued th-the same routine if we\ndidn\u2019t have anything like floods and fire.

        "Q: So I know that -- I know at least two stories about two of the individuals in the group, and I\nguess the two that I\u2019m thinking of refers to this older woman who was in your group --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and this other woman, a younger woman.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Yeah, we had -- when we c-came to this part of the -- or Socha took us to\nthis part of the sewer that we stayed at, we were 11 people, but it -- during the time that we were\nthere, I d-don\u2019t -- after few months, Mrs. Weiss, she -- she was a elderly woman and she had the\nasthma, she was sick and she was getting sick each time, and he -- he -- her health deteriorated\nvery much, and my mother used to take care of her, you know [indecipherable] to bring her food\nbe -- beca -- when she could and even later on sit and try to feed her and try to always, you\nknow, be with -- hold her hand and be with her and she said to -- to my mother that she -- she 1s\npraying that my mother will s-stay alive, that we will stay alive, and she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that God\nwill hear me, and you will s-stay alive,\u201d and wa -- one night she -- she passed away, and they t-\ntook her body and -- to the Peltew, and they thr-throw this to the water, to the Peltew. And -- and\nthis was one thing that happened, and -- a-another was th-the Mrs. Weinberg, when she did --\nwent down to the sewer she was pregnant but nobody knew about it, she was hiding. She was\nwearing a -- a big coat, black coat and she was always wearing this coat, and I -- I never saw her\nwithou-ou-out this coat. Sh-She was hiding and then after th -- you know, her pregnancy was\nvery advance already. Sometimes even when we were passing through those small pipes, she\ncouldn\u2019t go through and we didn\u2019t know why, we were pushing her, you know, through. Later on\nwe discovered that this is because she was pregnant, she -- she [indecipherable] even imagine\nthat the -- th-the pipe wa -- the width that she was when she was pregnant. And when we would\ndiscover that she\u2019s pregnant [indecipherable] I\u2019m talking about we, I didn\u2019t. I didn't know\nanything and my brother didn\u2019t anyway, didn\u2019t know anything, but you know, the grown-ups,\nthey -- that -- I knew that something\u2019s going on because they were talking quietly and they were\nspeaking Yiddish, then I know is something that I shouldn\u2019t know. And finally -- th-th-they were\nafraid to tell Socha and Wrobleski that she is pregnant. Now I th -- I-I think that in the last day or\ntwo, they th -- they thought that she will give birth, they -- they told Socha that she is pregnant\nand that -- he -- he said, that is impossible that the -- the child will -- will survive here, a-and\nbesides, he was afraid that the ch-child crying will, you know, le-led to our discovery of us by --\nby people outside. And this -- that this was very dangerous. And -- but [indecipherable] and they\nleft, but meantime she -- day or two later, she -- she started to y-y-you know, delivering a baby.\nAnd my father was the del-delivery man. I -- I knew it was on the side of the -- she was laying in\nthe side of the -- the pipe, th-th-the -- the part, th-the -- of our compartment and the other\ncompartment and my father had the rusty scissors and he had this shoelace that he tied the\numbilical cord. And he deliver the baby and I -- I remember for a moment I heard the -- the -- the\ncry of a baby and then th -- 1-it was quiet. My mother was helping my father, she was next to --\nto Ginya Weinberg and she -- she keep -- she was trying to give the baby little bit water with\nsugar that he was sucking, but W-Weinbergowa, she was pulling my mother away from the baby.\nShe -- she -- she took the baby and she put on her chest and she kept and she didn't let my mother\nto -- to do it. And they were fighting among because my mother wanted to -- to -- to feed the\nbaby and she di-didn\u2019t want. And then my mother was so exhausted that she falled asleep. When\nmy mother fall -- fall asleep, the -- she suffocate the baby. She sacrificed the baby because she\nknew that is no way that the baby c-can survive there. And th-the next day when the so -- th-they\ndisposed the body of the ba -- the baby and next day wh-when Socha came, you know\n[indecipherable] people, we -- we told him that the baby, the -- it was a boy, and tha-that she k1-\nkill the baby. And he was very upset because he wanted to arrange something with the n-nuns\nand bring -- take the baby to -- to the nuns. But, you know, we didn\u2019t know -- she didn\u2019t know\nabout that. It was so quick. Th-This is what -- this is what happen.",

        "A: From -- wh-what I remember, like I mention already, that Berestitsky was religious, he had\nthe tallis and he was praying and probably he knew when the -- all holy days are coming, but my\n-- my mother kept every Friday evening, she light the candle -- Shabbat candles. And she ask -- I\nremember from the beginning, she ask Socha if who -- he wouldn\u2019t mind to bring her candles to\nlight again. He said no, no, no, and he was bringing her candles, and he like it very much that my\nmother kept the tradition. He was religious, and he -- Christian religion, but I think he knew what\nit is to believe, you know, in your religion, and he liked that my mother keeps the religion, the\nJewish tradition.",
        "Q: What about any of, you know, the high holidays? Were you able to mark them in any way?",

When he -- once\nhe had the sore throat, he -- he -- he -- h-he couldn\u2019t speak, you know, wi -- and Socha, when he\ncame, he ask my mother, \u201cMi -- Mrs. Heger, what do you think will help him?\u201d And my mother\nsaid, you know, the only thing -- she knew that we cannot get any me-medication because Socha\nwo-wouldn\u2019t go to -- to pharmacy to buy, because he was afraid that they will t -- ask who wrote\nthe prescription, because my father could write, but -- prescript -- he know how to write\nprescriptions, but he was afraid to do it. And my mother said, you know, the only thing what can\nhe-hel-help him is Gogel Mogel. This is a -- Gogel Mogel is that you take the egg yolk with\nsugar, and you mix it -- mix it to the -- to-together and you swallow this. And he said, oh, this is\nthe only -- she said, yeah, this is maybe. And you know, after Socha left, after maybe two hours,\nwe -- we heard th-the -- the noise of somebody coming. You know, this sloggish noise, shu, shu,\nshu. And w-w-we -- my father and Corsage -- th-the -- Mondek, he was standing, you know, next\nto the ho -- hole that he was cu -- coming, and they wanted, you know, to hit him, because they\nthought that this is somebody strange is coming.

        "A: It\u2019s mostly my brother. I was always healthy. Only -- I had only this episode of -- that I was\nso depressed. That was more, you know, the mental, psychological than the physical. But no, I --\nI -- I-I was healthy, besides the -- the -- the terrible diarrhea that we had in the beginning, the\ndysentery, but I-I was okay.",
        "Q: And once you had that it didn\u2019t return, it was really just at the beginning?",

I-I -- I ne -- remember that I had like a\ntee shirt I was we-wearing, and on this I was wearing this sweater, or I had something else too,\nbut 1-1 -- th-the tee shirts, once a week or twice a week my mother was changing on us and Socha\nwas taking our clothes, you know, f-f-for -- for laundry.

        "A: My f-father used to discuss with Socha always th-th-th-the politics and what\u2019s going outside,\nand Socha used to always bring the news. I think that he belonged to organization, the\nunderground Polish organization, and he knew wh-wha-what\u2019s going on, and we knew that, y-\nyou know, the eastern front is coming, that the Russian -- that -- that th-th-the German lost the\nStalingrad and they are now -- now retreating, and we were v-very happy. We were always\nwaiting and waiting wh-when it will happen. And my father discuss this. I didn\u2019t d-discuss, you\nknow, the politically -- from the point of view of politically, I -- I only was waiting til we can ge-\nget liberated and I can go out.

And they didn\u2019t discuss with me, whatever I overheard 1s --\nbut I -- In -- I knew, a-a-at the end, you know, my father was losing already hope. He was\ngetting depressed too. He was -- he was so anxiously waiting til we will be liberated that every\nday it was for him like a year. He couldn\u2019t wait for this, he was very, very nervous that -- the last\nfew -- few weeks, maybe two months or something. He -- he -- he was always afraid that it can\nturn back, you know?

        "Q: And so were you also feeling that something is in the air, something was changing, or did you\nonly know at the very last minute something had changed?",
        "A: No, I think that maybe the last few days, you know, we knew that something -- I knew that\nsomething is going 0-0-on, because my father was v-very, you know, al-already restful. He -- he\n-- h-he couldn\u2019t already wait. And this is why I knew that something is coming, but yo-you\nknow, we took day by day. I think that a ma -- that the one who was really reliving this, you\nknow, this coming liberation th-the most was my f-father.",
        "Q: Was your father the leader of this group, would you say?",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s what Socha call him, that he is the leader, that he is th-th-the group. He is the\ncaptain, he -- he say -- he said.

        "A: Yeah, some occasion Socha used to bring some -- some vodka and th-they used to, the -- the\ngrown-ups u-used to, you know, d-drink wi-with him and my father al-always was very worrying\nthat -- that they will not get -- Socha and Wrobleski will not get drunk. And this is why he\nalways drank the most amount of vodka because he didn\u2019t let them to -- to be drunk because he\nwas afraid, you know, when you drunk you can say something. But wi -- s -- Socha, once he --\nhe says -- said to my father that a -- that he -- my father is afraid that he will get drunk, th-that he\nwill sa-say some -- he -- he -- he felt, you know, that m-my father is accusing him of get dr-\ndrunk, and then my father said no, no, you know.

        "A: Well, we had another th-thing that ha -- that happened, that the few weeks, maybe three\nweeks before the li-liberation, suddenly Socha came with another person. And he wa -- th-this\nwas a -- a young man who was a deserter f -- he -- he was fighting on -- on the Russian side. He\nwas Ukrainian that fighting with the Germans on the Russian side. And he got to m -- he was\nPOW, the German t-took him in prison, and he -- he was a POW for -- for -- 1-1-in the -- Russian\nPOW in the German, and they treat them terrible. Th-Th-They tr-treated -- 1-it was unbelievable\nhow the German ter-terrible treat the Russians, the POWs. They tortured and th-the terrible --\nand wa -- one of the thing that they did that they forced them to fight -- to put the German\nuniforms and fight against Russians, against their will. And he -- he escape. Somehow he -- he\ndeserted the -- th-th-the German army, and Socha\u2019s wife sister find him someplace a-and give\nhim a hiding place, and they fall in love. He -- he was very good I|-looking young man, and the\nonly place -- and they knew the Russians are coming, and they knew that Russian will kill him\nbecause he fought with German against the Russian. The German, if they will ca-catch him, he is\na deserter, they will kill him. Th-The only place that he can survive, it will be in the sewer. And\nSocha brought him to the sewer. When he came and he saw this, he si-si -- he turn around, he\nwanted to run. He said, in this condition he is not living. You must be -- th-th-this 1s like a-\nanimals. You must be animals, no-not human being that you can stay here more than one day.\nAnd he 1-1 -- ya -- he was miserable. He only wanted to escape. And Socha gave a gun to my\nfather, and he said, if he wants to escape, shoot him. And they took turns, you know, every few\nhours somebody else was watching him that he won\u2019t escape. And this is how it happened to the\n-- til -- til the liberation.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Tola. Tola. He -- after the -- I-I think after the -- the liberation that the Russian took him back\nto the army and he was killed in the army, yeah.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t know that, I\u2019m not even sure -- maybe it\u2019s in the book. Maybe those are the last 20\npages that I didn\u2019t read.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, I tried to read all of it, but -- but wow, I didn\u2019t know that somebody else had joined\nyou like that.",
        "A: Yeah, Tola.",
        "Q: So -- so now you are a total of 11?",
        "A: We are at -- back in 11, because he\u2019s the 11\" person. And, you know, we heard already\n[indecipherable] the planes, the Russians planes were coming and he -- bombs were falling, and\nwe were afraid that the bomb can hit the sewer because you are under the ground, very under th -\n- under the surface, you know, and the bomb can hit the -- the street and you are exposed, and\nyou are killed. And this was -- this I remember I was so afraid of, whenever I heard the noise o-\nof the a-airplane, I would start to shaking, because I was -- I heard the bombs falling, I said, oh,\nokay, that\u2019s it. It was -- this was one thing that I was so scared, and after the flood, the rain.\nWhen I heard the drop rain falling, I already was panicked. And -- a-and then the Germans were\n-- th-they started to dig and putting mines above us. And we heard the digging, the digging, and\nwe -- we were starting, you know [indecipherable], but it -- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s gonna -- it started to -- t-\ntaking the -- the carbide that we used to the lamp, th-the disposed carbide they used to move to\nthe side when they heard the digging 1s coming. You know, the German were digging from up,\nand then we were filling from downstairs that they couldn\u2019t get in. But it wa -- it -- Socha came\nin, we said to Socha, and he -- he went ou-out to the street and Kowaliw, you know, wa -- he was\nwith the authority that he 1s the -- the maintenance commander and he said to the German, you\ncannot dig here because there is a gas pipes here. And th-they didn\u2019t want -- and he said le-let me\ntalk to the re-responsible person here. It was some German, some Nazi, some Gestapo, I don\u2019t\nknow. And he said to -- to him, listen, those are gas pipes, the moment you hit the gas pipes, you\nwill all blow up. Th -- and they stopped digging. This 1s -- you know, every day was bringing\nsomething, but it was to the end on the -- a-already, and you are so afraid that in the last moment\nsomething can happen. You suffer so much. And -- and we heard, you know, the -- the artillery.\nWe knew that the Russian are -- are -- are close already. We -- we heard -- we -- we were scared\nfrom the bombs and then, but we -- we knew they are coming. And my -- my father was ti --\nwatching Tola, and it was time that the shift was changing that th -- Mondek, the\n[indecipherable] was taking over and my father was so tired he went to sleep and I fall asleep and\nhe was asleep. And then, when he was a sleeping, it was like early in the morning, suddenly we\nheard the noise, like somebody is banging o-on the crates, you know, on the manhole, the -- the -\n- the iron --",
        "Q: Gr-Grate?",
        "A: Grate, grate. I-Iron grates. And we were, you know, everybody was come, my father was\nasleep, he was so tired. And the rest was in the [indecipherable] was -- was listening and then he\nheard Heger, Heger, Corsage, you are free, you are free, you can come out. And he -- he said, I\nam giving you the plan how to go to -- each way to go. And he gave us to go th-through those --\nwe grabbed whatever we c -- you know, we had no-nothing, and we -- we -- we was crawling\nthrough those pipes til we came to the -- to the point that he said, th-this is the point that you\nhave to come out and if -- through it was the manhole, and he was open and he was standing, and\nhe said that the children are coming first. Then Mrs. Heger, then the women and then you, and\nthen the last is coming Heger, the captain. The captain is coming the last. And this is why -- how\nwe ca-came out. It was a courtyard next to the -- not far away from the sewers that we were\nhiding, above was a courtyard. He called all the people, and he -- he told them to stay and watch,\nand they watched like we were coming, like rats, you know, we were come -- and my brother\nwhen he came out, he started to cry. He said he wants to go back. He was so scared. He forgot\nhow the world look like. He thought that the whole life, his whole world is the sewer and those\nrats and -- a-an-and that\u2019s it, those 10 people. He was crying and he was pulling my mother, like\nI want to go back, I want to go back, and she explained to him in the --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number four, side A. Okay, go ahead.",
        "A: When we all came ou-out -- emerge from -- from the manhole of the courtyard, my father was\nthe last one, because this is what Socha said, that the captain is coming the last. And he -- he was\nso proud and he was smiling so har -- and he said to the people who are standing and watching,\nand surprised they were, you know, so shocked, and he said, \u201cThose are my Jews. This is my\nwork.\u201d He was so proud. He -- immediately, you know, he -- he went to the building and he\nstarted organize. The -- th-th-they were the empty a-apartment with the -- because the -- the\nGermans run ni -- run away. A-And he -- he said, this room will be for Heger, this is for Clara\nand [indecipherable] this is for Weinbergowa. He was the organizer, he set up everything, yeah.\nAnd then next day I think that he brought his wife and his daughter to meet us, and we met -- we\nmet them. It was unbelievable, 14 months.",
        "Q: Now, how long were you there again?",
        "A: We were 14 months in the sewer. We emerge in July 27, 44.",
        "Q: Can I just -- tell me how old were you at this time when you got out?",
        "A: F -- f -- \u201944 I was -- I was end -- eight and half, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you know the date, or you only later learned what the date was when you came out?",
        "A: I -- I knew the date because we were so anxious that, you know, everybody was counting the\ndays, and we knew that this is July. And y-y-you know, it was fu-funny thing, because a few\nweeks before th-the li-liberation -- it was maybe like a month before, or sa -- or six weeks, that\nBerestitsky, he woke up and he said that he had a dream, and he ask who is born in July? And\nmy mother said, July 23 is -- I was born July 23. And he -- he said that we will be -- we -- we\nwill be liberated in the day of my mother or a little bit later, that he had a dream, and he knew the\n-- the date. This why I remember exactly July -- July 27.",
        "Q: Did you know that the, you know, other parts of the war were still going on? Were you aware\nof this?",
        "A: We really were liberated July 23\", on my mother birthday, but Socha, during the liberation,\nthe mom -- he didn\u2019t come to the sewers. We -- he -- he -- he supply us with food before,\nbecause he knew he won\u2019t be able to -- to come, and he didn\u2019t want us t -- let us out. He was\nwaiting few days, because it happen in another city, in Tarnopol that after the German left, and\nthe Russian came, the Jews went out and then the German came back, and they all were killed.\nThis is why he didn't want to, he waited few days. That m-means July 23\" on my birthday,\nprobably this is when the -- the Russian came. This is what the prophet Berestitsky said.",
        "Q: So what were your first impressions when you got out -- outside and above ground again?",
        "A: When we got out -- at first I didn\u2019t see almost anything a-and then when I start to see it was,\neverything was yellow. You know what, my -- my sight was terrible til my eyes get adjust to\ndaylight. And then we were -- looked so terribly, you know, th-th-th -- the dress that we were\nwearing, things -- we -- we looked terrible, because I remembered when I was on the street with\nmy brother, some woman, she -- she passed us and he brought s-some fruit, gooseberries. And\nshe had it in the bag and she looked at us and she said -- and she gave us, and he said ha --\nchildren, have this. Sh-She felt the pity for us. This 1s -- we -- we probably looked terrible. I\ndidn\u2019t look to the mirror.",
        "Q: Were you -- were you very skinny at that point, were -- you know, because you weren\u2019t eating\nvery much, or how -- how was your appearance 1n that regard?",
        "A: | -- | -- fi-fir -- I was skinny, th-this 1s -- is one. The second, I had the infection. I have like\nabscesses from malnutrition. I-I still have scars fr-from this, and my father was very sick, too, he\nhad a lot of those abscesses. And he wa -- he was very -- very, very sick and thank God it was,\nyou know, penicillin that was discover, and my father was a -- was one of the first one, almost,\nwho got penicillin injection. And this, you know, s -- bring him his health back.",
        "Q: Did you need anything like that?",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t in such a critical condition that my father -- yeah, that -- with\nme, it -- it went through ba -- by themselves. They -- probably maybe I a-ate better, o-or --",
        "Q: How about your mother and your brother, how wa -- how was th-their health?",
        "A: My brother was very skinny. He was so skinny that -- unbelievable is that his two legs were\nlike two -- two -- two sticks. And my -- m-my father and my mother, they both were, you know,\nthey didn\u2019t ke-keep straight. Their posture was completely, y-you know, it -- 1-1t -- it -- they --\nthey were bent, they had -- backbone was completely dismanaged. Th-Th-Th -- they were bent,\nthey couldn\u2019t -- being bent for -- for -- for 14 months, the only time they could -- they could\nstraight is when they were lying down. And it -- it -- 1t -- this -- th-th-they -- and sh-she was\nskinny too, my -- my mother. But she didn\u2019t have this -- this infection that my father had, but she\n-- she -- she looked terrible, too.",
        "Q: So did you really believe this was it, you\u2019d finally made it? Would you -- were you at all sort\nof questioning, could anything else go wrong or change, or did you feel like we did it, we made it\nand you all sighed a big sigh of relief?",
        "A: I think that we f-feel -- we -- we felt that we, you know, are safe, at least fr-from the\nGermans, you know, that we made it, that you know, that we are liberated, we right now can try\nto -- to live normal life, and we had the hope, you know. It was very difficult, because no jobs,\nno th -- no -- no -- no -- no money, nothing. And 1-it was very harsh and difficult time.",
        "Q: And what kind of anti-Semitism greeted you at that point?",
        "A: Ha -- I -- I -- I know that we were liberated in end of July, and in September, the school was\nsupposed to start, first of September is school year start and my mother went to m -- to the school\nand to register me and the -- the secretary ask my mother, you know the name, th-th-the family\nname, the first name, the age when -- all th-th-those details, and she ask what religion. And my\nmother s-said moisia showa. Moisia showa, it mean you are Jewish. And she looked at my\nmother, and she said excuse me, and she went to the principal to ask if she can register a Jewish\nchild. And when she came back my mother was so angry, and my mother said, \u201cDid -- did you\ngo to the principal to ask if you can register a -- a Jewish kid to school?\u201d She -- she didn\u2019t say\nanything, and she register me to s -- t-to school, and I started to -- to go to -- to school, but I -- I\nfelt very bad, and you know, because my -- I didn\u2019t ha-have shoes. My father made shoes from\nold newspapers and sh -- sa -- make shoes for me, cover ma -- ma -- my feet. And I had this, you\nknow, that -- this clothes t-terrible, and I fe-felt very bad. I -- I remember that I was running, I\ndidn\u2019t walk, I was running because I thought if I run that less people will see that I ha -- don\u2019t\nhave the shoes, only tho-those newspapers. And I remember one of the girls, she was sitting -- I\nremember her face. She was sitting next to me, one day she ask me why I am writing from left to\nright? Th -- I should write from right to left. I didn\u2019t understand what she is talking about. I came\nhome and I said, \u201cMom, why is she\u2019s telling me that I should write from right to left, not from\nleft to right?\u201d She said, \u201cBecause Jewish alphabet, Hebrew, you write from right to left.\u201d And\nshe knew that I am Jewish, this is why she was asking me why I am writing this way and not this\nway.",
        "Q: Were you the only Jewish child in your class?",
        "A: Yeah, I was the only gi -- Jewish child. With m-my luck, I was almost always only Jew in the\nclass.",
        "Q: And did you experience other sort of incidents with other students or teachers or anybody else\nsort of make you feel bad in that way?",
        "A: No, no, no, 1-in Lvov -- we left Lvov in 45, 1-in I think ma -- March \u201945. This mean I didn\u2019t\ngo to -- to -- to s-school too long in Lvov. But I -- I remember very vividly. I study Polish, I\nstudy Russian, I had to, you know, say th-that -- by heart all the life of Lenin and Stalin, all those\ncommunist propaganda. And we -- we -- in \u00b045 March we escape, and we run to -- to Krakow, to\nPoland, because it -- in the Russian says that -- tha -- 1-1-1t came a law that P-Polish p-people who\nwant to immigrate to p -- to Poland -- because at that time, r-right now, Lvov 1s already Russia,\nthen y-you can emigrate t-to Poland. And 1 -- we -- we want in, and besides th-the Russian, you\nknow, it -- they wanted to send my father and us I think to Siberia because they found out that\nwe were bourgeois before the war, and this is, you know, terrible in -- under the Russian\ncommunist government. And th-then, another thing was th-they suspected that anybody who\nsurvived during Holocaust must be schpern, spy. This was -- this is why I remember my fa-father\ncame one evening and he said let\u2019s leave, and we left everything, whatever we have and we went\nto -- a-and we left to the railroad station, to the -- they were like cattle trains, and we stayed\nthere, we were hiding there, and it took us three weeks til we got to Krakow.",
        "Q: Three weeks on those trains?",
        "A: Three weeks on this train that right now it takes few hours, because it was after the war, the\nbridges were, you know, des-destroyed. And I do -- I remember just winter, it was so cold tha --\nmy father was burning little bit water for us 1 -- like in the sewer, he d -- he did in the -- from the\ns-sardines, y-you know, a -- a can? He used to put some water in the warming, this -- this is what\nhe did there, too, that we will have some warm water.",
        "Q: So this was yet another big change.",
        "A: Yeah. It was another thing, we came to -- t-to Krakow, and 1 -- I went to school in Krakow\nand my mother register me already -- not -- she didn\u2019t want to register me th-th-that I am Jewish,\nbecause after the war they had still pogroms in -- in Poland. And somebody told her, you know,\nfor her safe, say that she is Christian, and my aunt, because during the war she survive, she was a\nmaid to a -- a priest, she knew the all prayers, and she taught me the prayers. I had -- have to\nlearn when I went to school that I knew when to say, what to say when I went to church that I\nknow -- know what to say. And I -- the -- the principal, a woman -- very nice woman, very nice\nwoman, she knew that I am Jewish, and she said to my mother, you know, for her sake, let\u2019s say\nthat she 1s Christian. And this is how I -- I was 1-in Poland, til I went to high school. When I went\nto high school my mother said that this is enough, now you are going, you are Jewish.",
        "Q: But y -- had your name changed? Had your family changed its name?",
        "A: Yeah, when we came to Krakow, you know, the people advise us th -- ya -- change the name\nthat sounds more Polish, not J -- Jewish. And we change from Heger to Herowski, cause\nHerowski sounds very Polish.",
        "Q: And so nobody would question you or your family? Did anybody give you a hard time and\nsuspect that you were Jewish, or anything like that?",
        "A: They suspected we are Jewish. They suspected I was Jewish because wa -- wa -- one time th -\n- sa -- mothers of the few kids fro-from school, from class, they came to the principal and they\nask her if Krisha is Jewish. And the principal said no. And she said, why you asking? Because he\n-- she is too smart. This was their answer. That\u2019s really, you know, the-they always -- I\nremember th-the sign on the building across the street from us, Krishka [indecipherable],\nKristine, she\u2019s a Jewish. She\u2019s a Jew. I -- I went to Poland, you know, a few years ago to Krakow\nand I was looking for the sign, it\u2019s not there.",
        "Q: What is the sign? I\u2019m not sure I understand. Somebody put a sign?",
        "A: Somebody wrote, you know, o-on the wall.",
        "Q: Graffiti?",
        "A: Graffiti. Graffiti. Krishka [speaks Polish] it means -- in Polish it means Krisha a Jew.",
        "Q: And that was for you.",
        "A: This was for me because I live across the street, the windows, you know, from the windows I\ncould see the sign.",
        "Q: Did that bother you a great deal at that time?",
        "A: It -- it bothers me, you know. It hurt me, but after what I went through, I didn\u2019t care. I knew\nthat I -- th-this is it, that is anti-Semite, that I have to be very careful what I say, what I do. I\ngrew up with -- in this, the -- that I knew it. I -- I really -- like you, you know, you get used to\nthis, you -- you know, that you are a presi -- prosecuted, and yo -- I got used to -- used to this.",
        "Q: But at least your family didn\u2019t feel immediate danger in the same way before, even though\nthere was an awareness of -- of the anti-Semitism in Krakow, right?",
        "A: Yeah, it was much better, fir-first you know, the -- the government, we -- 1-1-1t was later on\ncommunist too, and a-according to the doc-doctrine, communist doctrine, everybody is equal.\nThey cannot -- officially they cannot do anything against Jews, but unofficially, under the table,\nthey did whatever th-they could to -- to hurt the Jews. But th-this 1s the -- yo-you know, he -- he\ndi -- we knew that we are Jewish and we knew that he -- we have, you know, to carry this -- this\nbag. But 1-1-1t wasn\u2019t that we were afraid that somebody will come and will kill us or something,\nn-no. And later on -- |-later, we di -- we didn\u2019t have any official, you know, pogroms or things,\nand maybe it happened, you know, some of -- one person killed the other person, but th-th -- th-\nth-the -- 1t weren\u2019t like after s -- immediately after the war. I-It was much b-better, the anti-S-\nSemitism was, you know, hiding. They -- they -- it wasn\u2019t so obvious, open, because yi -- it\nshouldn\u2019t be.",
        "Q: Was there one occasion where your mother had heard about a pogrom nearby and -- and was\nworried for your safety? Was that in Krakow?",
        "A: Yeah, th-this was in Krakow when the pogrom in Kielce. Was I -- I remember I was -- my\nmother was working and I was by myself with my brother and I went to a market to buy some\nvegetables, and my mother wrote me what I have to buy at th -- for cooking, and it was a one\nneighbor, a-and she -- she came downstairs and she said, Krisha, what are you doing here? Go\nhome, go immediate -- and I, you know, I was with my brother, holding his hand, and she said,\ngo home immediately. And I run home. When I came home my mother was running and she said\ngo home. Go -- this is when it happen 1-1-1-in Kielce. I think in Krakow they have pogrom too.",
        "Q: So school proceeded and you actually enjoyed some parts of school, or was it a difficult time\nfor you?",
        "A: No, I e-enjoy, I didn't -- you know, I knew that I am playing a role. I knew that I am Jewish,\nand th-th-this is only a game to -- to -- for me to survive, a-and I knew it and I c-continue with\nthe -- I went with my friends fr-fr-from school, I went to the -- th-the church, and I si-si -- you\nknow -- you know, wi -- all the procedure what\u2019s going in the church here I did, I knew how to\ndo it.",

        "A: Yeah, 1-1-it -- 1t -- usually during vacation, because of our health problem, we were so\nmalnourish, and that my parents always wanted, you know, to -- us to go to the countryside, to\nthe villages, because we -- then we can have a fresh milk, fresh eggs, everything fresh and build\nup little bit our -- our health. And my father rented a room and we went with my mother, we\nstayed there. And then after awhile we -- y-you know, my m-mother pay attention that\nsomething, you know, the people are going around the house that th -- we were staying and one\nnight she heard noises next to our door, even th-the door were locked. And I remember th-th-the\nne-next day or two the -- the woman from which we rented th-th-the -- the apartment, she came\nto my mother and he said, \u201cYou know, it will be much better for you if you leave, because they\nare planning to kill you.\u201d And, because from the beginning, she didn\u2019t know that we are Jewish,\nbut somehow you know, those people around, they found out. They had a ver -- th-the -- the cris\n-- Pole -- Poles were very good nose to find the Jew. And the -- w-w-we -- we left. We left, my\nmother -- my mother called my father, or g-g-got in touch with him and by train it -- or he ca-\ncame by car, I don\u2019t remember, a-an-and we left, because we were afraid that they will kill us.\nThey were running with the knife, and when we only c-came a day or two after, you know, my --\nth-th-th-the woman that we rented the house talked to my mother, we were walking and she\nthink, you know, Hitler, the Germans were bad. The one thing bad that he -- Hitler did, 1t was\nthat he didn\u2019t kill the whol -- whole Jewish population.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve been back to Poland as recently as a month ago --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I believe, and I don\u2019t know how many times since -- since the war, but have things\nchanged?",
        "A: I -- I went few -- few times becau -- because I ha-had to go, and besides, you know, Poland is\nbeautiful country. The nature is so beautiful, the mountains and the lakes, the rivers, th-th-that 1s\nbu -- really beautiful. I enjoy it to look at the nature. I am not so proud and happy about the\npeople who -- who live there. I think that the new generation has a different view. Th-They are\nchanging. They, you know, are learning much more and they are learning much more about the\nJew -- Jewish culture. They are learning right now about the Holocaust, they never learn about\nthe Holocaust during the communist government, you know, the -- and I hope -- I hope it will\nchange. You can see the difference in the big city, like for example, in Krakow y-you talk to\npeople they -- th-they -- they talk the -- completely different, but in the small villages, I don\u2019t\nknow if it\u2019s so much change. And th-th-the -- the big influence 1s the church. The -- the -- the\nanti-Jewish propaganda is even still there. You know, the special thing that they are blaming\nJews for killing Jesus, for his blood and th-things. It -- even though the John Pope the second, he\n-- he said they have to change, that they shouldn\u2019t say that Jews killed Jesus, and other country\nare changing, but in Poland if you go to the mass, and I went to the mass to hear it, they still are\nsaying the same.",
        "Q: You said that you needed to go back. Was that for any reason --",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- tied to the war, or anything?",
        "A: This was because -- you know, my husband was born in Krakow, his whole fa-family 1s in --\nin Krakow. He went through, he is Holocaust survivor, too. And it was few things that he has to -\n- to take care of. Yeah, a-at th -- this is why he -- we went. But like I said, the country 1s\nbeautiful.",
        "Q: So now, let\u2019s go back to you living in Krakow, and you were living there from about what age\nuntil what age? How old are you at this point?",
        "A: I -- I live there from -- we came in \u201945, March \u201945, and I left from Krakow to Israel in 1957,\nSeptember 1957. So maybe --",
        "Q: \u00b045, about --",
        "A: -- for 12 years. 12 years, yeah, I went to -- t-to school there, I went to -- you can call high\nschool. I started my medical study in the University of k -- of Krakow.",
        "Q: Which was very unusual for a woman, and a Jewish woman, I would presume?",
        "A: They -- at that time, they didn\u2019t ask you, because this is already communist government, you\ndon\u2019t ask religion. Religion is not the subject right now. If they don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t say\nanything, but my friends, they knew that I am Jewish. They knew.",
        "Q: And was it unusual to be a woman in dentistry school at that time there?",
        "A: I-In Poland, not. Eastern European, more woman, or equally maybe, or even more women in\ndentistry than men. The -- it wasn\u2019t anything unusual. Yeah, wh-when we leave, I -- I -- I want to\nmention to you that in 1945 in May, we got a news from Gliwice because Socha escaped from\nLvov after -- in \u00b045 to -- to Poland, too. He escape at --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number four, side B. So you were telling me about Socha and his\ndream to have a bar.",
        "A: Yeah, he -- he -- he dr-dreamed that after the war he will open -- he will have his own bar.\nAnd he moved to -- to Gliwice where Margolis live with his wife, with Clara, because Margolis\nand Clara they ge -- got married, and th-they live in Gliwice for awhi -- while. Helena used to\nlive in Gliwice, too. And we got a -- anews on May 13, it came a telegram that Socha was killed.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: \u201945.",
        "Q: Oh, just 45.",
        "A: May.",
        "Q: Just after the end of the entire war.",
        "A: Yeah, th-th-the war, yeah, na -- May na -- nine, it was the end of the war. We got a telegram\nthat came from Gliwice that Margolis send us that Corsage died. It was in ma -- May 1946, and it\nwas shocking news. We -- it was like something falling fr-fr-from the sky. And we w-went to the\nrailroad station, we went to Gl-Gliwice, and h-he went to his home and to the funeral and he -- I -\n- | -- I think going, you know, to the -- walking after th -- his -- what that\u2019s called?",
        "Q: Oh, the casket --",
        "A: The casket.",
        "Q: -- or the coffin.",
        "A: Coffin.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Walking a-after h-his c-coffin and seeing him on the ca-casket, 1t was the worst thing that\nhappened to me. And it -- 1t was devastating for all of us. We were -- he -- he -- it was in a car\nac-accident. He was riding the bicycle, and on the -- another bicycle was riding hi-his daughter.\nAnd in the front, approaching them from the fr -- opposite side was a army truck, a Russian army\ntruck, and the driver was probably drunk, and Socha saw this and he s-start to pedal much faster,\nthat he came in front of his daughter, and in the last moment the -- th-the truck hit him and not\nhis daughter. And what is unbelievable, that his blood was dripping through the manhole to the\nsewer. We u -- we couldn\u2019t believe it, and when we were standing, you know, at the funeral in\nthe cemetery, we heard that somebody said, this is the -- the punishment from God for somebody\nwho saved the Jews.",
        "Q: Did you stay in contact with the others who were saved with you from the sewers?",
        "A: We -- all of us were very close, especially -- I have to say th -- especially Margolis, beca --\nwe felt, you know, like a family. W-We, all those year til now, I am, you know, I -- in touch and\nI -- with their -- their children and with her -- their grandchildren. And 1 -- unfortunately\nWeinbergowa, who married Haskell, they lived in Germany, and they b-both pass away. She was\nvery sick. She s-suffered for depression and it was a very difficult life for her. And Helena, di --\nshe got married and she lived in United States, she has two children, and unfortunately she\npassed away, she had a heart attack. And my parents and my brother, they -- they lived in Israel.\nMy brother lost his life in Israeli army.",
        "Q: When did this happen, with your brother?",
        "A: It happen in 1978. He -- he was 39 years old, and he -- he -- he was killed. He -- he left a wife\nand two children. And my father passed away in 1975, and it was my mother who has to go\nthrough this. And -- but, like always, sh-she was very strong woman, and she live til her 90\u2019s,\nand she pass a-away t -- in January 10, 2000. From those all 10 people -- from all those 10\npeople who survive in the sewer for 14 months, and who survive Holocaust, I\u2019m the only one\nwho is still alive. And this is why I am telling the story, that I am the last eyewitness news. I\nwitness that, saw this, went through this and can say that I saw this, not that somebody told me.",
        "Q: And your father also wrote memoirs. How did that come about?",
        "A: My father used to keep the memoirs 1-in -- in the sewer, he -- he used to write, but a-after the\nwar he wrote -- he had a -- wrote a -- a -- with his -- his handwriting memoirs and when he came\nto visit me in the United States in 1975, w-w-we force him to put his -- in writing and to -- to\nwrite this on -- on the typewriter. And I -- I went with my husband to lower east side, and we\nfound old Polish typewriter, and we force my father to sit and write it because we said, now you\ndon\u2019t have any excuse, you have the typewriter, and type it. And he wrote the m -- memotr, I\nhave the manuscript of his memoirs, and this memoirs are from 1939 til 1945. And after he wrote\nthe memoirs, when he went back to Israel with my mother, and a-after half a year he pass away.\nThis was like his last document that he put the all historical facts and mor -- everything what\nhappened to his family and the rest of j -- of the Jewish nation.",
        "Q: Have you remained in contact with Socha\u2019s family?",
        "A: We were 1-in contact with Socha\u2019s family, and a-after -- she died and n-now I am not in\ncontact with the rest of -- o-of the family because his daughter, she -- sh-she felt that we did\nsomething wrong, that we said about him that he was a -- a -- a thief. And she is holding against\nus why we mentioned this, but this was the truth, and this was very important truth, and the fact,\nand I don\u2019t want to miss any -- any facts. This is, you know, historical event and everything has\nto be truth. The truth has to be said, but I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t think that this 1s something negative. I\nthink that he is the no -- the most p-positive figure that can exist, and -- f-for us, for the survivors\nand for the families of the survivors, we always talk about him, and he is like, for us he is like a\nangel, like si -- like you know, sent by saint, sent by God to save us.",
        "Q: Do you think your experiences during the Holocaust affected your thoughts about God?",
        "A: This is difficult question. I don\u2019t know how to answer. I -- I am not religious, this mean -- I\nkeep the tradition. I ke-ke -- the holy days, I can light the candle, I pray, I say the Kaddish for --\nfor my family, for Socha. But my mind is very scientifical too, and those are two -- two fields\nthat are fighting either -- each other. I really cannot say. But I think that somehow it is some\npower, bigger power th-that we are. I don\u2019t know how -- how to call this. I don\u2019t know even if\nEinstein know how to call this. But something must e-existed. I-I -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And can you just then, finish telling me you left -- when did you -- your family leave Poland,\nand -- and walk through a little bit of the chronology of the rest of those years, you know.",
        "A: We left Poland in 1957. It was a time that the Polish government somehow agreed to let some\nJews to leave -- 1-immigrate to Israel. And we immigrate to Israel, my mother had a sister there,\nand th -- and her family and w-w-we -- we came to -- to Israel, we d -- live in Haifa. My -- I went\nto the kibbutz to -- to study Hebrew language, but I w-was in the kibbutz only for three weeks,\nbecause the s-study -- u-u-university started in October, and I wanted to continue my education. I\nwas accepted to the Hebrew University, to the dental school, to the second year, and I continue\nmy study. That wasn\u2019t so easy, from the beginning because I didn\u2019t know Hebrew, and no\nEnglish, but I manage. And th-th-then I -- I g-got married. My husband was in the army, my\nbrother was in the army. I -- my first son was born in Israel. I graduate, I have my practice,\nprivate practice in Israel for seven years almost, and then in the 1968, my husband parents got\nthe visa to United States, visa for which they were asking in 1945, in Krakow. They apply in\n1945, and they got this in 1968. And when we -- my parents-in-law didn\u2019t want to emigrate from\nIsrael, but they said, if we want, we can use this visa. We went to the consulate and they told us\nif we will not use it, then we will lose it. The entrance permit to -- to United States, and we -- we\nsaid okay, we will try, and we plan to come for two years and from those two years is already 36.\nAnd I got my license here, and in 1970 I started my own practice. I was teaching in n -- NYU,\nand then I started my own practice that I de-develop, and my older son, who was born in Israel,\nhe -- he -- he was -- he went in my footsteps and he graduate from Columbia University dental\nschool, he is a dentist. He was practicing with me for 17 years, and now this practice 1s heres --\nhis, because I, after 46 years of -- of working, and bending my back, decided to retire. And here I\nam in the meantime, when we came to United State, I have a-another son, and -- who didn\u2019t go\nmy footsteps, he -- he became a city planner, and he is working for an environmental p --\nenvironmental position he has. And I have -- both are married, I have two grandchildren, and I\nam happy. I -- right now 1-in the -- the 208, 1-1-in spring, my -- I wrote a book, and the book will\nbe publish in the spring in 208, about my experience and my life, and living 1-1n the sewer and\nbefore and after, everything will be in the book, and I hope that the future generation can read it\nand come to conclusion that you have to fight for whatever you want, and n-not to give up.",
        "Q: Also, is your father\u2019s memoirs available anywhere for people to read?",
        "A: My father\u2019s memoir are not translated, they are in Polish, and I am trying to tr-translate this\nbecause this 1s really a historical documents. He puts the dates and the names and everything in\nit. | would love to publish. Maybe after I publish my wa -- my book, I will try to find a translator,\nthen can translate it and publish and give it to the museum. It is, I think, I\u2019m not sure --",
        "Q: Even a copy in Polish --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- might, you might want to put in the museum, right?",
        "A: I think it 1s.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll check on that.",
        "A: Pm not sure. I know that they ask for it, but I don\u2019t know. I wanted to give it them a copy, I\ndidn\u2019t want to give them the original.",
        "Q: Right, sure. Can you just --",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: -- can you just describe to me, since we\u2019ve talked about it, just give me a little description of\nthe sweater from your grandmother.",
        "A: It used to be green -- green color, and it\u2019s like, around the neck, it look like chanel, and it had\na short sleeves, and a little ba -- bit, two strings in the front that you can close the -- th-the ne --\nmake a necktie. And this is the sweater that I cherished the -- the most, and when I show the\nsweater to my son -- sons, they were at -- in my house once and I show them, and they -- honest\nth-they were so surprise, and I think what they said, Mom, you were so little. Because they\ncouldn\u2019t imagine that once is -- their mother was a child too, and the sweater is a reminder of it.\nThe sweater I-I donated. First I wanted to keep it for my kids, but then they -- they said, Mom, if\nwe will keep it, nobody will see it. You better -- and I know that -- that the museum donated f --\nasked for artifacts, I -- I give few already, and the sweater I kept. And I ag -- ag -- agree, and I\ngive the sweater to the wa -- Washington museum. And it\u2019s still there, and it was on -- on\nexhibition, travel exhibition in New York, and I took my grandkids to see it, and they saw this,\nthey couldn\u2019t believe it, they said ma -- Grandma, you were so little. But they were -- they were\nso proud. And right now the book that I want to publish, it probably will be -- have the title of,\nThe Girl in the Green Sweater.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just curious, what is it about this sweater? Is it the color, or just that your grandmother\nmade it for you? Is there anything in particular that made it so favorite, you know, such a favorite\nfor you?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know. I got so many things, you know, fr-from my other grandmother\nthat used to go to Vienna and bring me so many things. It may be because I saw my grandmother\nknitting this for -- for me, and when I look at the sweater I see her face, I almost see her sitting\nand knitting. Maybe this was something I -- it\u2019s very difficult to ex -- explain, that it had such a\nvalue to me, and I was a little child, and still I knew how to evaluate things.",
        "Q: I just have two more questions for you, and one is, I\u2019m just amazed at -- at the level of your\nmemory. You know, your memories are so detailed, it seems unusual. And you were so young. Is\nthere anything that you can say about that or any thoughts that you have about having such\ndetailed memories of all these things?",
        "A: Usually everybody always said that I have very good memory. It was in the school, and even\nwhen I used to give deposition the first time that I gave deposition, this was in the orphanage\nafter the war, that I was [indecipherable]. And I gave deposition in 1945, and the people with\nwhom -- to whom I talk, they said oh, you remember so good everything. But what I think why I\nremember so well, it is like a carve in my memory, in my br-brain. Those are bad things and\ngood things that you -- you brang probably [indecipherable] and it stays with you. I can\u2019t explain\nit. | -- even now when I went to -- after s -- I went to Lvov after 60 years, and I recognize every\nbuilding, ever -- every floor, every park. Wherever I went when I was a little child, I\nremembered. We had the guide, and I was guiding him how to go and where to go. He was\namazed. He said, how can you remember those things? I-I a -- I don\u2019t know. I s -- probably it got\n-- when you are getting so involved in something, it goes so deep in y-your memory that it stays\nwith you. And probably this had a such impact on me, the things that I went through that is all --\nalways with me. I-I will never forget this. I-I live with this every d-day to -- from one day to\nanother. I live with my -- my story.",
        "Q: What are the most regular reminders? Are they s-smells, or -- or noises? What are the things,\nyou know, that you live with every day in that sense? What are the things that remind you?",
        "A: I-It\u2019s -- it was -- you know, things that reminds me, it is like you have -- you get a feedback s-\nsometimes from a smell, fr-from a taste, from th-the noise. For example, when it start to rain I\nalways -- I -- I always hear the rain, because I remember what happened with the flood 1-1-1-in\nthe sewer. Is so many things that it -- suddenly can trigger your memory and you go back. But\nthe ya -- the whole life that the memory 1s working for me til now, thank God, that I-I think it has\na positive make-up -- po-positive feeling fo-for me, and positive way for my life. It made me\nstronger and made me look clearer, and made me be more careful, more observant and more\nhumane.",
        "Q: And did you talk much to your family about your experiences? Your children as they were\ngrowing up? When did you start talking about your experiences?",
        "A: The one thing that I have to tell are -- are about family -- my family and people that we\nsurvive with, especially the -- the Margolis\u2019s that we were in contact with. We talk about our\nsurvival. We tal-talked -- you know, in some occasions, something when we me-meet together,\nor some -- sometimes from nothing, sometimes that remind us something and we say oh, you\nremember this, oh you remember this. A-And -- and sometimes you know, some jokes. I still\nremember the songs that we were singing, the jokes that th-th -- my father was telling. And 1-1-1-\nit was -- this is thanks to my parents, they -- they talk about it. I-I know that some Holocaust\nsurvivors didn\u2019t like to talk about it. We talk and I th -- I think 1t was much better. We didn\u2019t\nhold it in and we di -- among us. We didn't talk to anybody else, but a-among us. We -- we -- we\nlive with this.",
        "Q: And when did you start talking to others?",
        "A: I start talking to others, it was after the documentary. This was done by BBC, and after child\norganiz -- Holocaust survivors, the children who survive Holocaust, they had a meeting, I think it\nwas first meeting in \u201989, in Marriott Hotel. And it was like 1600 Holocaust survivor children that\nsurvive came to this convention. And so many people from media came, from all around the\nworld and people we -- we met each other, we started to talk and suddenly I felt free that I can\ntalk not only to my family but to the other people. And then I was, you know, may a -- I-I did a\nfew interviews with the different newspapers all around the world, even to -- to German\nnewspaper, to -- to Japanese newspaper. And I did -- I was invited to -- to schools and to other\nplaces to talk about this. And this is one thing that I really don\u2019t like to do it, but I\u2019m --\nsometimes I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m looking from different point of view, I think that the young\ngeneration has to be educated, and this is why I\u2019m doing this. Is very painful, but from time to\ntime I am doing this.",
        "Q: Well, I appreciate you taking so much time to -- today to do this interview, and I wanted to\njust simply make sure to ask you if -- if you feel that there\u2019s anything that I may have left out\nthat you wanted to -- that you wanted to mention.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think so. I think that you -- you were very, very precise with your -- writing your\nquestions and you didn\u2019t miss anything, I think.",

        "Q: Before the war, were you in any kind of schooling at all, in Lvov?",
        "Q: So now, if you could tell me, I\u2019m going to -- all right. If you could tell me about what else\nwas changing. Well, first of all, September 1*', 1939, did you have any awareness of the start of\nthe war in Poland before -- cause I think it\u2019s three weeks later when the Russians take over Lvov,\ndid you have any awareness at all?",
        "Q: How long then was -- were you in shelters like that? How long was the bombing? You know,\nhow long was that going on?",
        "Q: So now what do you remember about that transition, about when the Russians actually came\nin?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number one, side B. If you could continue where we got cut off.",
        "Q: Was that something that -- that you did to -- your family did to take them in because they\nwere refugees, or was this somehow required by the Russians to -- to live like this?",
        "Q: So do you -- do you remember this as a pretty difficult time, or what are your personal kind of\nrecollections from this particular era?",
        "Q: Did you have any awareness at this -- at this earlier stage about the Nazis, before they actually\ncame in, did you have any awareness as a young child?",
        "Q: So now tell me what are your earliest first memories about the Nazis taking over Lvov, and --\nand when is this, and -- and give me a sense of how old you are about this time.",
        "Q: So you have -- you have a -- a vivid memory of actually seeing Nazis on the sort of day that\nthey come in? Tell me a little bit more about what you actually saw, and this is from your -- from\nyour home, right?",
        "Q: Do you -- did you see violent things right in front of you from the window from the start, or --\nor was -- you didn't see that directly from there?",
        "Q: An-And how scared did this make you feel as a six year old at that time?",
        "Q: Did you get to see that friend of yours any more from the building, the concierge\u2019s daughter?",
        "Q: Did you -- were you aware of, or did you know about then the pogroms taking place in the\nimmediate aftermath, you know, after the Nazis came in and the Ukrainians, I guess, killed, you\nknow, thousands, right?",
        "Q: Were -- were you all still living there, the other tenants with you still?",
        "Q: What was going on with your -- your father and I don\u2019t know if your -- I guess your mother\nwasn\u2019t working when the Russians came, but what happened to your father\u2019s work at this stage?",
        "Q: Was he able to do that once the Nazis came in?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying those times that you moved, that was actually because the Nazis, the\nGermans were saying to your family, you have to get into the ghetto now, you have to keep\nmoving.",
        "Q: What were some of the items if -- if you could only take a few things each time, were there\nany like favorite items you remember as a child that you just had to hold onto and take with you\neach time?",
        "Q: And that, of course, is a sweater that you -- explain what -- what happened with that sweater,\njust fast-forward for one moment.",
        "Q: What were some of the other -- I guess, could you explain -- the times that you were moving\nfrom place to place, and the places where you lived, were there these round-ups going on? I\nguess, actions?",
        "Q: Yeah, if you can explain more about that.",
        "Q: Well, were you -- were you very aware at that time of people being killed, and what was\nhappening after these round-ups?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: How long would that last, or how long would your brother be in a suitcase like that?",
        "Q: Was your brother terrified? He was younger and probably didn\u2019t understand or know as much\nof what was happening?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number two, side A. You were telling me about your brother.",
        "Q: So, were there other children that you were aware of or even learned about after the fact, who\nwere doing -- you know, hi-hiding like this and surviving like this? Were -- were they actually\nlooking for children during these round-ups, or what were these round-ups about?",
        "Q: So, at what point, and -- and was it -- was it a -- a real change for you when the ghetto was\nthen sealed in or fenced in and -- and what are your recollections around that particular time?",
        "Q: Do you think it -- it made a big difference, it helped that -- that your family did have some of\nthe financial resources from -- from the earlier days? These kinds of incidents, do you think that\nhelped a great deal?",
        "Q: Oh, cyanide?",
        "Q: Did you know that she had that at the time?",
        "Q: At that age did you think much about death? As in your own possible death at that time?",
        "Q: So I\u2019m not sure if -- if there\u2019s a -- a difference, or if you want to just talk about what kind of\nwork your father was still able to do, and was there a difference between when the ghetto was\nnot yet sealed and when it was sealed?",
        "Q: So it didn't mean that he -- that this person trusted your father at all, he just used him for -- for\nhis skills, I guess.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "Q: And there was a close call, do you remember when it happened, with your father and him,\nright?",
        "Q: And you saw that?",
        "Q: Once the ghetto was sealed, were you in the same apartment then, consistently, or were you\nstill moving around?",
        "Q: What\u2019s the address? Do you know the address of that place?",
        "Q: But that was somebody else\u2019s apartment at one point that you moved into. Is that how that\nworked?",
        "Q: What did you eat during this phase? What were you able to eat and how hungry, you know,\nwere you, often?",
        "Q: During this -- all of this time being in the ghetto, were -- was your family able to observe any\nJewish traditions, any of the holidays in any way?",
        "Q: And what, if any, specific memories do you have of -- of your own interactions with any of\nthe Nazis? Did you have any, you know, that you recall during all of these different episodes,\nand -- or were you able to successfully hide and not have any real interaction?",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s interesting. So they were actually, at least a few of them were somewhat, you\nknow, protective and friendly towards you.",
        "Q: And as a child did you -- for instance, the one I guess you sat on his lap, did you like him?\nDid you feel comfortable, or were you always sort of scared of any German at this point?",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "Q: I just want to go back for a moment cause I remember reading something about your\ngrandfather and what happened to him, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s on your mother\u2019s side, or your\nfather\u2019s side.",
        "Q: It\u2019s your -- it is your father\u2019s father, then, right?",
        "Q: And this is when your father ran after him?",
        "Q: And when did this happen?",
        "Q: You were in the ghetto, or --",
        "Q: Those were his parents?",
        "Q: Do you think your father was following them to try to save them or do something about the\nsituation, or -- he just wanted to see what happened, I guess.",
        "Q: Did you ever see your father become truly depressed by something like this, or did he try to\nstay optimistic for his children?",
        "Q: So, before we -- I think we\u2019re almost ready to start talking about the plans for your family to\nescape, but before that, I just wanted to ask, were you aware of deportations taking place from --\nfrom the ghetto? What was your awareness as a child of -- of these sorts of things, or where\npeople were being taken, or did you hear much about -- about that?",
        "Q: Where was she taken?",
        "Q: Do you know which one she was at?",
        "Q: What happened to your other grandparents, your mother\u2019s parents?",
        "Q: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Which -- which of the grandmothers is the one who made the sweater for you?",
        "Q: And what happened to your grandmother, this maternal o-of -- of my f-father, she was taken\nin th -- one of the aktion together with my cousin that I was running, and she -- sh-she didn\u2019t\nhide, and she was taken by the -- by th -- by Germans, and I saw her through the w-window, I\nwas peeking, and I saw there on one of the lorry and she was holding my grand -- my cousin\nInga, and I was happy that at least she is with her grandm-mother.

This is when -- when I last saw her.",
        "Q: What was her name, your grandmother?",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll come to you.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr.\nKristine Keren. This is tape number two, side B. So, before we actually talk about the escape,\ncan you tell me what you knew, if anything, about plans to escape, what your father and if your\nmother was involved, what -- what you knew, what was happening and -- and how long before\nyou did escape were plans being made?",
        "Q: What\u2019s his full name?",
        "Q: How was your father able to plan for this? Do you know now sort of what -- what happened,\nin -- in brief -- you know, even though you didn\u2019t know at the time, but how did he plan for this?",
        "Q: Was your -- would you characterize your father then as an optimist? You know, y-y -- all\nthese terrible things are happening and then this idea that he would give a lot of money to\nsomeone he barely knows. Do you think you would think of your father then as just -- I mean,\nobviously very determined, but do you think he was generally very optimistic?",
        "Q: He -- he -- he was optimistic per-person, but he was too, very determined, and he didn\u2019t, you\nknow, lose the -- the believing that he can save us. He -- he -- he grab everything what can d --\nhe -- he grabbed, only to -- to save us. And he was person who -- who t -- took risks. Because I --\nif my father wouldn\u2019t take risk, we wouldn\u2019t be alive, because it was during the -- you know, the\nghetto time, it was so many times that he t-took risk, and I-I-I -- and he stay alive, that I-I-I-I -- I\n-- | don\u2019t -- sometimes you know, I\u2019m thinking and I don\u2019t know what is -- is it, 1t was a luck?\nMost of the t -- of the time I think it was luck that -- that we are alive.

        "Q: Do you have any idea how much money your father wound up paying Socha?",
        "Q: And your father was able to save a lot of money somewhere without, obviously the Nazis --\nthe Germans finding his resources.",
        "Q: So now, going back to when you first enter the -- the sewers, tell me just how old are you at\nthis stage, and how many other people are joining you in this first rush into the sewers? And is\nthis right about the time when the liquidation is happening?",
        "Q: Tell me what\u2019s going on in the ghetto.",
        "Q: And where is this -- you know, most of us haven\u2019t obviously been in a sewer system, so\nwhere is the sewage? You\u2019re sitting in this cave --",

        "Q: Were you complaining as a -- as a young child in your first encounters with the actual sewage\nflowing by, were you complaining at all? Or were you aware that this was your, you know,\npossible escape for freedom?",
        "Q: Can you describe then what that looked like a little bit more?",
        "Q: And still the sewage is flowing by here as well?",
        "Q: Were you scared of them?",

        "Q: Now how would you characterize the other men who were helping, the other two, I believe\nwho were helping Socha? Were they, you know, as devoted, would you say, to saving you? Or --\nhow would you describe them, their motivations?",
        "Q: When did you run -- when did your family run out of money? Do you know when that\nhappened while you were down there?",
        "Q: And -- and prior to that there was actually another story, I think, about the gold, or the\njewelry?",
        "Q: And -- and so, right, a lot of money was used not for Socha to get rich necessarily, but to -- to\nbuy the food and the items that you needed, right?",
        "Q: What happened after you ran out of money? Was Socha able to afford buying these items for\nyou on his own?",
        "Q: So, if we can go back to describing just a little bit more the conditions of -- of where you were\nliving, and you said that it was under this manhole cover, in this -- this space that you stayed in\nfor a good long period of time, do you know where that is in Lvov? Have you identified where\nthat manhole cover 1s?",

        "Q: It certainly seems like such an unusual story. Now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of other\npeople surviving the war and the Holocaust this way in other places, but in Lvov, were the Nazis\nor the Germans thinking about this? Thinking that maybe somebody is down 1n the sewers hiding\nlike this? Do you think it was, you know, on their radar?",
        "Q: I think wa -- from the beginning, were -- when the liquidate the ghetto, they -- they -- they\nknew that people were hiding. In -- 1-in the sewer they thr-throw even some places grenades\nthrough the manholes. But later on, th-th-they, you know, nobody could imagine that so long\nafter the liquidation, you know, people can still survive in the sewer.",
        "Q: Now, besides your intact group of 11 at that stage, were there any other groups that you know\nnow, you know, did also survive this way in those same sewers in Lvov?",
        "Q: When your mother would tell you, don\u2019t worry, your time will come to go outside again and\npick flowers and be outside, did you -- did you keep a high level of hope, or did you get\ndiscouraged? How did you feel, personally?",

That wha-wha-what happened, the Russian, they took the whole business, they took --\ncame to the sto-store and they told my father to give him the key, and they sa -- t-told him to -- to\n-- to -- to leave th-the business. And th-this is wh-wh-what happened. We -- we -- they -- my\nparent, they have a few employees that were wor-working for -- for -- for them. They -- the --\nsome of them went home, some of them stayed and worked for the Russian government. And th-\nthis was a big shock for -- for my family. We -- we lost our en -- en -- and a -- nanny and we lost\nour maid because our maid said that now everybody is equal she doesn\u2019t have to work for -- for\nrich people. And 1-1-1t was a -- a completely -- completely change in our life. My mother stayed\nat home, my father started to look for -- for j -- some kind of job that we can survive, and t-to --\nto survive he needed like two jobs because the salary were so low, that from one job you -- you\ncouldn\u2019t, you know, e-e-exist. I don\u2019t mean t-to -- to any luxury, but it was the simple food was\nvery difficult to get. You had to stay in line and you had to had some type of connection that you\ncan get a -- a loaf of bro -- o-of -- of bread, o-of a little bit of butter. It was very difficult, and\nbesides it was politically difficult too, because you know -- I didn\u2019t feel this maybe so much, but\nI remember that my parent were very scared and afraid because they belonged to -- to bourgeois\nand bourgeois sh-should be in Siberia, not in -- 1-in Lvov. And besides too -- t -- our apartment,\nwe got two tenants.

And the other room for -- 1-\nit was for a father and a son that esca-escape from Krakow or some other city. And this way we\nhad only wa-- wa -- one bedroom and -- and the kitchen and the -- the kitchen was for th-the --\nthe -- the tenants -- th-the -- the refugee, they could use th-the kitchen, th-they used to cook, and\nthey used the -- the bathroom, 1t was common for all of us.",
        "A: It was both. I-It was -- Russian didn\u2019t like that you have t-too many rooms, the fa-family, and\nbesides, it was y -- they wanted to -- to help those refugees who really didn\u2019t have a place where\nto -- where to live.",
        "A: If -- if you take that e -- we will co-co-compare the life that I\u2019ve had before and the life that I\nhave after \u201939, it was different. It was more difficult, it was more tension, because my parents\nwere always very tense, and were always, you know, a -- a -- I-I-l-looking outside with -- they\nwere afraid. It was completely different. It was for me, for a child it wasn\u2019t so bad that for them,\nbut I could f-feel th-the tension that was going on in the family. And f-for me, I was still playing\nwith the kids, I -- I was going to the kindergarten. Thi-This time I -- I had a m -- my mother in\nhome, and from this point of view I was very happy.",

I didn\u2019t know\nanything about the Nazi before.",
        "A: It was in June, 1941. This -- I -- I was al-already six years old, and I remember this vividly\nbecause it was the same first -- 1t was th-the -- the -- the airplane and the bombing, and we went\nto the shel-shelter, and I was watching through the -- through the window the same similar like\n\u00b039, but 1-it -- this time it was -- my -- my parents were co-completely de-depressed and th-th --\nmy father said th-th-th -- I remember to me, he -- we-we had bad, but this -- this is worse, what is\n-- was coming.

The -- he -- I -- I remember hear the screaming\nand yelling and th-th-the Germans, the -- the -- on the motorcycles are roaring through the --\nthrough this street, a-and the Ukrainians who -- who were so glad that the German came. They\nwere happy, the women, Ukrainian women were thi -- giving flowers to -- t-to the Germans,\nbecause the Germans promised them that they will have the independent Ukraine now. This is\nwhy they were so -- so happy. And the one who were suffering the most, they were the Je --\nJews, because Ukrainian hate the Jews before the war, and did th -- the -- pogroms before the\nwar, now they had the free hand from the Germans and they did -- did a ver-very good job by k-\nkilling and beating the Jews.",
        "A: I saw this from my home, from the window.

        "A: No, from the window I could see, I could see how the Ukrainian were hitting the -- th-the\nJewish people. The -- th-the German didn\u2019t got involved so much, they -- they left th-the -- th-the\nbad work to the Ukrainians.

But, you know,\nthey try to keep from us. They didn\u2019t want to -- to scare u-us too much, but th-the time was\nterrible because the Germans started to come already to our apartment and they took all our\nfurnitures, all our belongings. But they took it, I remember they came and they took th-the piano\nand th-the -- the German, he -- he came and he saw the piano and he started to play, he played\nvery well, and he liked the piano. And he -- he -- he send people and they took it. We -- we were\nsitting on the floor with few belongings and that\u2019s it. Everything was gone.",

And then they went to the third floor, and they went to the ot -- 1t was a two\napartment, but they told that this is one apartment, similar that on the second floor. That mean\nthey took those people who live on the right side and they didn\u2019t come to our apartment. It was a\nsheer luck that they didn\u2019t take us. But 1-1t was -- they were picking, you know, just coming to\nthe -- and taking Jews from the apartment, then they told us that we have to take our things and\nleave the apartment. And we left. We went to another place on Zamar Stenowska 34, that\nsomehow my grandfather, he -- he said some relative used to live there, and we moved there in --\nin one room, it was maybe 10 - 20 people, and we stayed there for -- for a week, and 1-it was\nvery crowded, terrible, and we moved to another apartment, also on Zamar Stenowska street, but\nit was little bit farther.

And I -- I don\u2019t know exactly where he was\nworking because it was a short time, th-then -- then we moved to Zamar Stenowska, then we\nmove in another place, and he was working, he was working like a carpenter when we leave,\nbecause this already was ghetto.

And th-th-they -- th-the --\nthe Germans, e-every few months they were cutting from the space from -- from the ghetto, and\nthe Jews had to move to different place. And -- and we move a few times, we -- we move from\none place to another, because the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller, and at a certain time, I\nthink it was in -- in \u00b042, m-maybe that 1-1-1t -- it came mu-much smaller and it became cal-call-\ncalled Julak.",

And I cherish this sweater, I -- I\ndon\u2019t know wh-wha -- what was, you know, what were my feelings that I g-get so attached to\nthis sweater that I was always wer -- wearing, trying -- whatever it -- w-we move, I -- I -- I took\nthe sweater with me.",
        "A: Yeah, th-th-th -- the sweater, 1-1-1 -- was saved, together with me -- me.

        "A: Oh, the aksia?",
        "A: Oh, the -- the -- the aktion, they call these aksia, and th-this was a -- a plan fr-from a German\nand the Ukrainian to t-t-take th-the Jews, as many they could for yu -- or con -- or kill them on\nthe spot, or take them -- around Lvov it was a place called Piaski where they killed them, or they\ntook them to the concentration camps. They used to come with the lorries and pack the lorries\nwi-with -- with the Jewish people in the terrible, terrible con -- circumstances that -- that they\nwere hitting them and killing them on the way to -- on the way to the lorries, and it was plan of --\no-of the Germans. It was few actions. It was -- one I remember was terrible, it was when we live\non Zamar Stenowska 124, that it wa -- they call this August aktion. It was a few days, I think\nfrom the beginning of the August, like -- like a -- the whole -- the whole week. And they were\ngoing from apartment to apartment, whoever were -- was in apartment, ta -- ta-taking the people\nout, and kill them on the spot, or -- or send them 1-in for th-the concentration camp or other\nplace, t -- t-to killed on the way to concentration camp. And it -- it was a -- the terrible -- the\nJews w-were divided in -- 1-in the ghetto for two -- t-two group of people, the people who work\nduring the day, and the people who were working during the night. And th-th -- they used to\nwork in the Janowska camp. It was a labor camp that the people were working for the German\ncompany. My mother was working there, and she was sewing the -- the uniforms for th-th -- for\nthe Germans. The people who were working during the day, they had the letter R. The people\nwho were working during the night had the letter W. And, for example, in the aktion in th -- in\nAugust, e -- 0 -- everyb-body who had the letter R, had to be taken out and killed. And n-n-next\ntime, in the other aktion, 1t h-happened that the people who were wearing W stay, and the R -- o-\nopposite -- th-the W, th-they were supposed to be -- be taken out a-and killed. And this was\ngoing on every -- every di -- f-few weeks or few months, sometimes. You never knew the -- th-\nthat will h-happen. It was a -- one aktion that they did th- the -- to kill the -- a-all children.\nWherever they found a kid, they kill him and is -- on the spot [indecipherable] or th-the kid was\nsmall, they took them by the legs and hitting with h-his head th-the -- the building wall, and --\nand throwing on the -- on the lorry. I-I-I -- it -- all the time w-we have to hide. And a-all the time\nmy father used to build some hiding places for us. And he -- he had such a -- a -- an -- he was\nsuch entrepreneur, and he had a really genius when he was finding places, and built for -- for us\nto hide. One of the place that I remember, it was a -- a under the window ledge. He -- he -- in\nEurope they build thi-this way, that the window, under the window ledge you -- you have a space\nbe-between the -- the bricks. And he put a -- a -- a artificial wall and he camouflaged the wall,\nand it was a space maybe to -- width, it was maybe one foot, and maybe length it was like four\nfeet. And we were sitting there with my brother on the potties, he -- he gave us two potties in\ncase we have to go. We were sitting there and he ca -- ca -- bent completely, like you know, like\nhe -- the babies 1-in the mo-mother\u2019s womb -- womb, and h-he used to lock us there, and then put\na table in front o-of this. And we were sitting there, a-and waiting til he will come back and he\nwill free us from there. I -- I remember that this was the wor -- this was the -- the worst time for\nme. I was so scared, and I used to cry and I -- my brother used to cry and we were holding hands,\nand -- but we were cry -- crying -- only the tears were -- were pouring through our cheeks. We\nwere -- they were silent tears. And -- because we were afraid that somebody can hear it that we\nare crying. And I used to always tell my brother, it will be okay, it will be okay, don\u2019t worry. At\nleast my brother had me, that I could tell him d-don\u2019t worry, but I didn\u2019t have anybody who was\nholding me and saying don\u2019t -- don\u2019t worry at that time. And th -- this is the -- during the whole\nwar, I think that this was the -- one of the worst thing that I went through, hiding in -- in those\nplaces and waiting for my father to come and to free us fr-from this.",
        "A: At that time that we started to live in ghetto, I was ev -- aware of everything what\u2019s going on.\nI saw people killed, I saw people murdered. I saw people be -- be y-you know, hitting by the\nGermans, by the Ukrainians, and 1-1-1 -- 0 -- 0 -- on this place that we live in Zamar Stenowska\n124, once I went to the -- we had the -- like a ba -- small backyard there, and I went there and I\nh-heard some kind of noise, si -- so-some noise that -- like s-s-some -- [tape interruption]",
        "A: Like I's -- I said when we were living in Zamar Stenowska, and the -- I -- I was o-outside for -\n- for awhile 1-in the backyard and I heard -- 1-it was a fence backyard, and I heard some like a g -\n- cries, a-and the voices of -- 0-of people, and the sounds of hitting and I looked through the hole\nin -- 1-1n the fence, and I saw like th-three or four Ukrainian boys hitting like with baseballs,\nhitting -- 1t -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t baseball, but something si-similar, and they were hitting a Jewish\nman and he was crying and asking for them to stop, and I couldn\u2019t do anything. I run upstairs to\nmy mother and I said what\u2019s going on, she said, you can\u2019t do anything. We -- we cannot -- you\nshouldn\u2019t even be outside. It -- I-I saw so many things that I have those pictures always with me\nand they are coming suddenly, that I even expect to -- to see like a f-flashbacks f -- in -- in my\nmemories. Sometimes I have, during the dreams that I have, I see th-th-tho -- tho-those faces,\ntho-tho -- I hear those voices. I-It was -- it was terrible for a kid my age to see so terrible things\nhappen to -- to other people. But I wasn\u2019t a child any more, I was already a grownup. I had a -- I\nwas more like a -- a animal, I have those instincts, that I knew that I have to hide, that I knew\nthat I have to run and this is probably what saved ma -- my life, because one of the aktion I was\nwith my cousin, and I saw the German coming, I said to her, run, and we were both running. I\nwas the faster one and I hide, she didn\u2019t and she was taken. And she -- she was taken and to the\nconcentration camp a-a-and -- and killed. It\u2019s -- and I-I knew how to make a di-di-diff -- how to\ndifferentiate -- to make a difference between footsteps. I kn -- I could recognize the footsteps of\nthe German a-and not Germans. And I knew w-when I have to hide when I was left alone\nbecause most of the time I was alone, my mother was working in the Janowska labor camp, my\nfather was working like a carpenter in the ghetto, and I was left alone with my brother. S-\nSometimes I -- when I heard the -- the footsteps and I knew that they are Germans, I -- I grab my\nbrother and I put him to a suitcase that -- I push -- close the suitcase and I push under the -- th-\nthe bed, and I by myself was hiding in the corner of the room behind my mother robe -- a night\nrobe that was ha-ha -- it -- it -- he -- he was til the floor, I knew that I can maybe hide there --\nthere, but I made sure that my feet will be back, that the German couldn\u2019t see maybe in my -- my\nfeet standing out from the end of the -- of -- of the robe. And when the German left, th-they --\nthey went usually, they checked every -- they checked and they didn\u2019t see the kids, they left and I\nwas waiting a few -- another few seconds to make sure that they are not coming back and then I\nrun to open the suitcase and let my brother out because I was afraid that he will suffocate. This\nwas one of my hiding places that I foun -- found.",
        "A: It would take few minutes, because you know that they would -- th -- the doors -- you were\nnot allowed to lock the doors. The lo -- the doors had to be open in -- in the ghetto. They could\ncome, I remember that, that they opened the door, and they do -- went inside and they started to\ncheck, you know, they didn\u2019t check the suitcase now and they didn\u2019t check with -- luckily be-\nbehind my mother robe. And -- and they -- it took few -- few minutes, maybe two, three minutes,\nbut I was scared already, I knew I was so ] -- that I -- he won\u2019t have enough oxygen -- a-air to\nbreathe, that I have to o-open the suitcase.",
        "A: He was such a good child. He knew that --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, my brother, he -- he knew that he -- he cannot cry, and he -- he was li -- li-like --\nprobably like animal like me too, you -- you know? He -- he knew that I -- if I am saying you\nhave to go to the suitcase, he -- he never th-th -- questioned this. He -- he -- he knew that I am\ntrying to -- to save his life. He was aw-aware of everything what\u2019s going on. He was little boy,\nhe was four years old, but he knew what\u2019s go -- going on exactly.",
        "A: Most of the -- the round-ups, they were always looking for children, because I remember that\nmy father didn\u2019t let me go out. He said -- and I was only in this room, I didn\u2019t go out -- outside. I\n-- we live in -- 1-in the -- w-we the -- we moved from -- from the Z-Zamar Stenowska. We -- we\nthen -- we live for awhile with my grandfather and then we move to another place, and then we\nwind up 1-in the building, the -- the Wehrmacht was on the ground floor and we live on the first\nfloor -- floor. I -- I -- I think, and I know that some kids were living in this building because I\nremember wa -- one -- one day it was a -- a aktion, that a -- a round-up for the kids. My father, he\nh-hid us, but other kids weren\u2019t so lucky, and they will -- taken out bow th -- by the Germans.\nAnd I remember when th-the -- the mothers, when they came back and they ran to the apartments\nand they didn't see the kids, they were -- they were calling the kids, and the -- the kids weren\u2019t\nthere, and some the -- of them, commit suicide, jumping from the second floor. And I remember\n-- J-I -- I remember the sound on the falling bodies and I ask my mother, what\u2019s the ca -- the\nsound, and she didn\u2019t want to tell me, she said no, I di-di-di -- don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look. But I\nlooked and I saw it. And this wa -- the mother th-that came and didn\u2019t find th-the -- their\nchildren, and they commit suicide. This is how I know that there must be more children living in\n-- in this -- the building that we lived.",
        "A: I-I-I -- for me it wasn\u2019t s-such a b-big change because I-I -- I -- I was inside all the time right\nnow for -- for awhile already. And I knew I have to hide, and I knew that from time to time my\nfather was hiding in -- as -- there. Then once he -- he built a -- a bunker 1-1-1n the basement of\nthis building and h-he -- he hid us there and then the German found out about the place because\nsomebody told him that my father 1s hi-hi-hidding th-the -- the kids, the family, because my\nmother was there too. And th-th-they started to -- to rip the -- the wall that my f-father b-built,\nand we -- we came out and th-they started to hi-hit us and then my father s-started to beg the\nGermans t-to leave us alive, and th-th-they did, and they ask him who build this, he said that he\nbuilt it, they ask him why you build it. Because I want to save my family, those are my children\nand my wife, and they started to hit him and I remember that the -- like the blood was dr-\ndripping from my father face and my f-father head. A-A-And then my -- my mother, she had the\nwatch, and she -- she gave this to the Germans. She -- she tried to bribe them, and th-th -- th-then\nh-he said, th-the one of the German, oh-oh -- okay. Th -- one kids can stay, one kids will go and\nhe -- they told my mother and my father to choose which one will stay, which one will go. And\nmy father took from his pocket picture of me and my brother together, and he said, those are my\ntwo kids. I can\u2019t make the different, who will go and wh-who will stay. Please let them s -- both -\n- both of them stay. And s-somehow I-I think that my father gave it to him his watch, and\nsomehow he said, okay, [speaks German here] he said, in German. And we -- we stayed there,\nbut we were afraid if we will go upstairs to our apartment that the other German will come or the\nUkrainians will come and they will take us. And my mother s-sa -- ask him to go with us to the\napartment. He went with us to the apartment and he stayed and he -- my mother ask him if he\nwants something to eat, if he -- h-he -- he wants eier with -- he said eier with zwiebeln, eggs and\nonions. And my mother made for him tho-those eggs. She started, you know, t-to say -- to keep\nhim busy, to stay as long as -- as he can. And th-this way we -- we -- we stay alive. It was a pure,\npure luck. I -- I -- I can\u2019t -- I-I -- I -- I don\u2019t know ho-how to explain this, that so many thousands\nwent and we stayed.",
        "A: An -- absolutely. If you had -- at that time it was very important to make some jewelry, some\nvaluable things to -- to bribe the Germans, to bribe the Ukrainians, because th-th -- even if the\nGerman lets you go, the Ukrainian didn\u2019t. And th-th-this was a main commodity at that time.\nAnother ca -- ta -- commodity that was very valuable in that time, it was the cyanide. It -- it -- th-\nth-this is the toxin, you know, that y-you take to commit su-suicide.",
        "A: Cyanide, cyanide, yes. And my mother, she always have with her, three vials, small, t-tiny\nvials, one for her and one fo-for each of her child because she said that the German will -- will\nnot take us alive. And my father, probably he had one too.",

        "A: Leopold Socha. And he came -- he introduced himself and my father said that this is his wife\nand two children, and this is how we met Socha. And then few days later, I remember it was a\nbig commotion, people were running and screaming and my father came and said, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s\ntime w-we have to go. And we went to this opening in the floor o-o-of the basement and I saw a\nbig hole, dark. And my father said, go there. I said, I can\u2019t, Iam not going. And he went and then\nI didn\u2019t want to go, and I think my mother or somebody else push me, and he grabbed me down,\nhe grabbed me, and I heard -- the moment I went there, I ca-came down, I heard this noise of\nfalling water.

Stick to me, stick to me,\ndon\u2019t -- don\u2019t worry. And then my brother came, and my mother, and this is how we started our\nlife in -- in the sewer th-that we went down. It was a -- a lot of people, commotion, because\npeople what -- were coming fr-from th-the manholes around th-the ghetto. They were coming to\nthe -- to the sewers. I-I-It was -- 1t was terrible. It was like going to hell.",
        "A: Yeah I -- no-now I -- I know, he planned -- we -- he met with the -- like I said that he -- he\nwas the carpenter, and responsible, he had the crew, people working. One of the crew, it was\nBerestitsky, Jacob. He was a [indecipherable] and a religious man. And my father k-k-keep him,\nyou know, to -- to work for him, and Berestitsky approached my father and said, \u201cHeger, I know\nthat you are building and building those hiding places, but you ha -- you -- you will not succeed.\nIn the end they will kill you and kill your family.\u201d And they started to think about where you can\nhide, and they came to a plan that 1-in the sewer. And my father remembered the sewer because\nwhen it was built -- because it was a river, Peltew. And because of the stench and the -- you\nknow, the hygiene, the -- th-they decided in the municipality in the early 900, they decided, you\nknow, that they have to cover this. And they used -- my father was little when he was going and\nwatching the -- the people who are working there. They -- the Italian POW\u2019s were building this,\nbecause it was Galicia that\u2019s time, you know, different politics, different -- and they were\nbuilding this and my fa-father remembered how they built, he -- he -- he remember how it look\nlike. And they came to a p-plan, you know, that t-to -- to -- to maybe, you know, to find a place.\nAnd they started to dig, they were digging from this basement, then they came down. When they\ncame down, they -- they saw a light from a lamp, and th-three people came to them and they ask,\nwhat are you doing here? They were sewer workers, that they, y-you know, k-k-keep control of\nthe sewers if everything is normal -- 1-in order working, you know, in order. They keep the -- the\nmaintenance of the sew -- maintenance worker. And my father said to him, you -- you know, I\u2019m\nlooking for place to hide my family from the Germans. Now he started to laugh, and th-th-they\nwere starting to talk, and then he -- he sa -- he said he wants to do what he did and he look and\nhe said, it is not so bad, but y -- w-we can help you, but if -- for a pay -- payment. And he\nmentioned some amount of money, it was a big amount of money. And my father said to him,\nokay, I will bring you tomorrow. And when w -- they came to the basement, you know, th-th-\nthey -- few people were involved in this, it was Berestitsky, it was Weiss, and some his friends,\nand Weiss s-said to my father that he is stupid that he agreed to pay him so much money. And\nmy father said, what else can I lose? I-I have to try. And next day he came back and he gave to --\nto -- to Socha money, and Socha wanted -- then Socha came up to the basement, and this is when\nI saw him. And then later on he said when we were 1-in -- in the sewer sitting, he said that he\ndecided to save us when he saw my mother sitting with those two children. And he said, I saw\nthis picture, it looked like a chicken with the hands. And this is when I decided that I will sa --\ntry to save you. And --\nknow. But my father was ve -- he was optimistic I can say, because I cannot say that somebody\nwho will be, you know, very pessimist and depress, h-he would give up mu -- much early.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how much money he gave him from the bi -- when he went down, but it must be\nbiv -- a -- a lot of money because wi -- Weiss was screaming a lot. That\u2019s why I think it was a lot\nof money. And they -- and they -- we -- he agreed to pay him every day, 500 zlotys. 500 zlotys at\nthat time, it was probably even 200 dollars each time. You know, each day when he came, he --\nhe was buying food for this, and then wa -- what\u2019s stay, it was for -- for him.",
        "A: I -- I think so because otherwise how -- how he would have? I think that one of the hiding\nplaces that my father built, tha-tha -- I think he kept th-the money and he kept the jewelry.\nBecause later we -- we paid with jewelry, too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: This -- this was, I think end of May, May 30 or beginning o-of June, that 1t was a liquidation\nand this is why the people started to run and be run t-to -- to th -- to the sewer. And this was in\n1943, the beginning of June 1943, and I was at that time, I was like seven and half, yeah, and my\nbrother was f-four years old. And a-at that time, and d-during this panic, lot of people came\ndown. I don\u2019t know if lot of people came down through our entrance. I think that -- more that\nthey thought because people find out that this is an entrance. But lot of people came from the --\nfrom the manholes. And th-th-th-then 1-it was s-s-such a y-y-you know, screaming and yelling\nand th-th-th-th-the falling water, and th-the echo. It-It-It sounded so terribly, and you -- you\nknow, the ledge that we were walking, it was maybe one foot wide, and we had to walk, we had\nto -- with our back to the walls, and slide, you know? But from the beginning when we went\ndown, I remember that my father -- I was -- h-he was holding me on his back and my mother was\nholding my brother, and this is how we walked. Then I ask him constantly where are were going,\nwhere are we going, and he -- he co-constantly wa-was you know, telling me, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t\nworry, you will be okay. Wa -- and we pa -- we had to pass on the other side o-of the river, and I\nwas so scared, there was such a -- a narrow passage I-like a bridge, small narrow bridge, and I\nwas so scared. We passed to the other side. Somehow we wind out 1-1n the one of the branches of\nth-th-this sewer, looked like a cave. A-And so many rats, a-a-and, you know, the stench, 1-1-1-it\nwas t -- a-a-and the w-w-w -- webs of the -- the spider webs. Wherever we -- we went we had to\npush the spiderwe-webs aside. It was terrible. And we stayed there, 1-it was lot of people, I think\nmaybe some 70 or something. Lot of people there, a-and then after Socha came and sh -- he ju --\nhe took a group only of people because he couldn\u2019t, you know, support -- he took like I think 21\npeople, and we went to different cave, and we were sitting there for -- for long time, I -- I think\nmaybe two or three weeks, or maybe longer.",

        "A: I wasn\u2019t complaining. I -- I -- I was s-scared. I was very scared but I didn\u2019t complain because\nI -- you know, I believe in my father, and I thought that he said I have to go there, that I have to\ngo there, no complaints. And we were sitting in this one -- space 21 of [indecipherable] we got\nvery sick. We got dysentery, we were very weak, we didn\u2019t have water to drink. My father used\nto go miles on his knees and elbows and he was keeping a teakettle in his teeth and he was\nwalking like this, he f-found this place when the -- drinking water from a fountain, in the main --\nmain market in Lvov. Was dripping from the statue, the statue of Neptune. And he found this\nwater and he was bringing, and he wa -- the water for us, and we have like a -- and he divided th-\nthis, we divide like th-three quar-quarter of a -- a -- of a cup, you know, for th -- each person for\nthe whole day.

And then from this place after -- some people left because they couldn\u2019t take it.\nThey said they -- they -- they can\u2019t take it, they left. But the moment, you know, they -- they left\nout sight the -- the sewer, they were killed, and from the whole group, I think we -- we -- it was\nlike 11 people that we stayed there, and then we were -- discovered where another sewer\nmaintenance worker, he came from the manhole because the manhole was leading to the place\nthat we were sitting and we had to run from this place. We run from this place and we -- we met\n-- Socha was coming to -- with the food and he saw us running and he took us to a different\nplace. And we changed the places few times because it was -- some of them were so cold and so\nterrible that we couldn\u2019t s-stay there. And finally we -- we-we wind up in a place that when w-\nwe crawl in, Socha ask my mother, \u201cWhat do you think Mrs. Heger, what do you think about this\nplace?\u201d And my mother said, \u201cOh, Mr. Socha, this is a palace.\u201d And this is -- there in this palace,\nwe stay to the end, to the el-el-el-el-liberation.",

He -- he found a -- a friend with people of\ncompletely different background, and he was very proud, and besides he -- I think it -- because\nhe was very religion, he wanted to pay for his sins, and he look a-at th-this like kind of\nredemption and this is what I think what -- there were the forces that kept him going and save us.\nAnd he -- he -- he was a great person. For me, I -- I loved him and I still loved him, and when I\nsay kaddish for my parents, I say kaddish for him, too. I-I-It was a -- a great person. A great,\nrighteous person, and we always, the10 of us who survive and the families of 10 of us, we\nalways remember him and his name.",
        "A: He is. He is named a Righteous o-of -- th-the Nation. He is in Yad Vashem. He has -- he --\ntrees on his name was planted already like 30 years ago there. He is on the permanent exhibition\nin Yad Vashem. This is a new wing, like now, this is for Righteous People, and he is among\nthem. He, as a matter of fact, I think that the biggest place on the walls is -- is dedicated to -- to\nSocha.",
        "A: I -- I would describe them, they were righteous people, you know, and th-th -- they did this,\nbut they were not so devoted, were the -- I can, you know, see, like Socha. He was the machine.\nHe was the brain 0-o0-of us because it came a moment that we didn\u2019t have any more money and\nmy mother was delegated to tell him that we don\u2019t have any more money and Socha said, oh, if\nyou don\u2019t have n-no more money, then we cannot work any more. But he came next day, he\ncame like usual and he brought us food. But I know that he said that the -- Wrobleski and\nKowaliw wanted to stop but he -- he forced them n-no-no-not to -- not to stop and he succeeded.\nHe was y-y-yo -- you know, taking his -- his work that -- to-to -- to the end. He told this is his\nde-destiny and this is what we wanted -- he wanted to accomplish and he did. He was very proud\nof this.",

        "A: Yeah, it was a-after I think that we stayed there almost a year, only be -- a little bit less. We --\nwe runned out -- ou-out of money, we -- we-we had some jewelry with us that my father was\ngiving him, but we run out of this too. And then my father re-remembered that his aunt, o-or --\ntold -- told him-- a aunt -- I think aunt, that she hid some money in the cellar of her apartment\nthat she used to live, and th -- sh-she tol-told this to my father, and my father m-made the plan,\nhe wrote on piece of paper, he designed the plan of the -- the -- he remembered th-the -- the\nbuilding and the cellar and he told Socha to go there and ma-maybe he can dig and he can find it.\nAnd Socha went there together with ro -- Wrobleski and they said that they are from sewer\nworking, that is some kind of gas leak or something, and they we-were digging and they found\nth-the jewelry. And he -- he -- and the next da-day, we ha -- I remember Socha came, and he --\nhe -- he -- he had the jewelry and he give this to -- to my father. And he said, Mr. Heger, you will\ngive me yi -- like usually, every day little bit. And this is how it happen. Every day my father\nused to give him, like before, certain amount of jewelry or money, and he was taking this in,\nprobably, or selling or -- and then buying a food for us.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: He -- he p-paid for on his own for -- for -- for the food. He probably had, you know, some\nmoney because th-the money that we -- my father paid him, it was a lot of money and not\neverything went for buying the food, he probably had, and he used this money t-t-to -- to\ncontinue.",
        "A: Yeah, thi -- two years ago I went to Lvov, and I went to places that I remember for -- for --\nthat they were [indecipherable] where I was born, when I live [indecipherable] and where we\nmove from place to place in the gh -- ghetto, I identify each place, and identify the -- the\nmanhole that we were lead -- it was leading to our hiding place, to our palace. And if -- 1s funny\nbecause next to the manhole right now is a coffeshop and th-th-there were table and -- and chairs\nand people were sitting drinking coffee, drinking beer, and below it was a place that we used to\nlive, 14 months.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a st -- a street. It is a small park next to a church, and 1-1t was a street and a\nsidewalk a-and buildings. And this is where th-th-this is at -- he -- he -- this is -- we -- we were\nsitting under the s-street level.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t th-th -- if somebody opens the manhole, he has to go down, then he can see us,\nbecause you go -- 1-1-is a pipe that leads you down and then you have like branch to the side,\nsmaller one that lead -- that will lead you straight to our place. That it was under the angle I-like\n45 de -- 90 degrees angle, th-the -- the branch.",
        "A: No, in this place, not. I-I -- we only were very ju -- you know -- we ke -- quiet, we kept our\nvoices down, and -- because we could hear, you know, people outside talking, I heard kids\nplaying in the park and -- and y-you know, picking up the flowers and I always ask my -- my\nmother if I will be able one day to go, to be outside and live like the other kids. And my mother\nalways told me, don\u2019t worry, the time will come that you will be among the other kids, and you\nwill pick the flowers, too. And th-this -- we -- we have to, you know, be very careful, because the\npeople c-could hear us. And besides, after, you know, after the liberation when we came down,\nthe concierge from the building that\u2019s -- that\u2019s was next to the -- to the ma-manhole, she said that\nshe was always very surprise because when it was snowing, th-the -- only this place around the\nmanhole, this -- the snow was melting. It was probably from that w-we were cooking. Even that\nsometimes we block -- when we were cooking we used to block the -- the opening, that the smell\nwill not go out, but probably from our body, the heat from our body, that was radiating too, that\nthis -- that the -- it would -- the snow was melting in this place. And she was always very\ncurious, why only in this place the snow is melting?",
        "A: No, from what I know and I, you know, was interested to -- to find out and I remember my\nfather too was interested, nobody. And Socha told us nobody survive in the sewer. And I don\u2019t\nthink so -- I don\u2019t think that from the whole, you know, surviving stories that I heard, that is\nanother one about the people who survive in the sewer. Maybe for -- f-f-for two, three weeks,\nmaybe in the Warsaw ghetto dur-dur-during the uprisal, maybe, but nobody for such a -- a length\nof period of time survive in the sewer.",

I remember that I -- it was a time that I was -- after maybe a year or something\nlike this, I got very na -- depressed. I got very melancholy and depressed, I didn\u2019t want to talk to\nanybody, I didn't want to accept the food, and I was completely, you know, in my -- living in my\no-own world, completely I-losing faith that w -- that we can survive, that I can leave the -- th-the\nse -- the sewer. And 1-it -- it was like a few days, or-or -- or -- or even longer, and then my\nmother didn\u2019t know what to do and he -- she said to -- to Socha what happened, he was very -- he\n-- he -- and, you know, h-h-he was thinking about it and he -- he tried to -- to help me, and he\nwas very worry wh-wh-what happened to -- to me, and he -- he said to me one day\n[indecipherable] he took me with him, he said, come with me and he took me to a si -- place in\nthe sewer, to the -- under the manhole, that I could see the light. And he -- he picked me up, and\nhe -- he said to -- to -- to me, I-look. L-L-Look at the light, and breathe th-th-the air. And he\nstarted to -- to -- to tell me that y-you see, it will come a d-d -- a time you will be outside, you\nwi-will have th-the daylight, and you will li-live like other kids. Well, you have to be patient and\ndon\u2019t yi -- lose your hope. And he -- he took me back and then slowly, slowly, I started, you\nknow, to accept the food, and I started to talk.

And -- and\nthis was one thing that happened, and -- a-another was th-the Mrs. Weinberg, when she did --\nwent down to the sewer she was pregnant but nobody knew about it, she was hiding. She was\nwearing a -- a big coat, black coat and she was always wearing this coat, and I -- I never saw her\nwithou-ou-out this coat. Sh-She was hiding and then after th -- you know, her pregnancy was\nvery advance already. Sometimes even when we were passing through those small pipes, she\ncouldn\u2019t go through and we didn\u2019t know why, we were pushing her, you know, through. Later on\nwe discovered that this is because she was pregnant, she -- she [indecipherable] even imagine\nthat the -- th-the pipe wa -- the width that she was when she was pregnant.

And finally -- th-th-they were\nafraid to tell Socha and Wrobleski that she is pregnant. Now I th -- I-I think that in the last day or\ntwo, they th -- they thought that she will give birth, they -- they told Socha that she is pregnant\nand that -- he -- he said, that is impossible that the -- the child will -- will survive here, a-and\nbesides, he was afraid that the ch-child crying will, you know, le-led to our discovery of us by --\nby people outside. And this -- that this was very dangerous. And -- but [indecipherable] and they\nleft, but meantime she -- day or two later, she -- she started to y-y-you know, delivering a baby.\nAnd my father was the del-delivery man. I -- I knew it was on the side of the -- she was laying in\nthe side of the -- the pipe, th-th-the -- the part, th-the -- of our compartment and the other\ncompartment and my father had the rusty scissors and he had this shoelace that he tied the\numbilical cord. And he deliver the baby and I -- I remember for a moment I heard the -- the -- the\ncry of a baby and then th -- 1-it was quiet. My mother was helping my father, she was next to --\nto Ginya Weinberg and she -- she keep -- she was trying to give the baby little bit water with\nsugar that he was sucking, but W-Weinbergowa, she was pulling my mother away from the baby.\nShe -- she -- she took the baby and she put on her chest and she kept and she didn't let my mother\nto -- to do it. And they were fighting among because my mother wanted to -- to -- to feed the\nbaby and she di-didn\u2019t want. And then my mother was so exhausted that she falled asleep. When\nmy mother fall -- fall asleep, the -- she suffocate the baby. She sacrificed the baby because she\nknew that is no way that the baby c-can survive there. And th-the next day when the so -- th-they\ndisposed the body of the ba -- the baby and next day wh-when Socha came, you know\n[indecipherable] people, we -- we told him that the baby, the -- it was a boy, and tha-that she k1-\nkill the baby. And he was very upset because he wanted to arrange something with the n-nuns\nand bring -- take the baby to -- to the nuns. But, you know, we didn\u2019t know -- she didn\u2019t know\nabout that.

And she ask -- I\nremember from the beginning, she ask Socha if who -- he wouldn\u2019t mind to bring her candles to\nlight again. He said no, no, no, and he was bringing her candles, and he like it very much that my\nmother kept the tradition.

He -- his wife, she was cr -- doing the\nlaundry for us, and he was taking the dirty clothes and bri -- bringing the clean ones.",
        "A: My f-father used to discuss with Socha always th-th-th-the politics and what\u2019s going outside,\nand Socha used to always bring the news. I think that he belonged to organization, the\nunderground Polish organization, and he knew wh-wha-what\u2019s going on, and we knew that, y-\nyou know, the eastern front is coming, that the Russian -- that -- that th-th-the German lost the\nStalingrad and they are now -- now retreating, and we were v-very happy. We were always\nwaiting and waiting wh-when it will happen. And my father discuss this. I didn\u2019t d-discuss, you\nknow, the politically -- from the point of view of politically, I -- I only was waiting til we can ge-\nget liberated and I can go out. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s the eastern front and this front or th-th-this\nwasn\u2019t in my interest a-at that time. And they didn\u2019t discuss with me, whatever I overheard 1s --\nbut I -- In -- I knew, a-a-at the end, you know, my father was losing already hope. He was\ngetting depressed too. He was -- he was so anxiously waiting til we will be liberated that every\nday it was for him like a year. He couldn\u2019t wait for this, he was very, very nervous that -- the last\nfew -- few weeks, maybe two months or something. He -- he -- he was always afraid that it can\nturn back, you know? But 1 -- he knew really what\u2019s going on with this, he read the newspaper,\nSocha was u -- he bring him a news -- a Polish newspaper and sometime German newspaper, he\nread from the b-b-both sides.",
        "A: No, I think that maybe the last few days, you know, we knew that something -- I knew that\nsomething is going 0-0-on, because my father was v-very, you know, al-already restful. He -- he\n-- h-he couldn\u2019t already wait. And this is why I knew that something is coming, but yo-you\nknow, we took day by day. I think that a ma -- that the one who was really reliving this, you\nknow, this coming liberation th-the most was my f-father.",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s what Socha call him, that he is the leader, that he is th-th-the group. He is the\ncaptain, he -- he say -- he said. And he always ask my father and always t-told everybody,\nwhatever Heger said, th-th-that\u2019s it, a-and he always ask my -- my father th -- if he agrees, or --\nor if he has the plan, or he has some ideas or something, yeah.",
        "A: Oh!",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. This is a -- this is true. This is -- Socha used to bring sometimes with -- were s-\nsome occasion, some birthday, or on my mother birthday, the July 23\", he -- he brought some --\n[tape break]",
        "A: Yeah, some occasion Socha used to bring some -- some vodka and th-they used to, the -- the\ngrown-ups u-used to, you know, d-drink wi-with him and my father al-always was very worrying\nthat -- that they will not get -- Socha and Wrobleski will not get drunk. And this is why he\nalways drank the most amount of vodka because he didn\u2019t let them to -- to be drunk because he\nwas afraid, you know, when you drunk you can say something. But wi -- s -- Socha, once he --\nhe says -- said to my father that a -- that he -- my father is afraid that he will get drunk, th-that he\nwill sa-say some -- he -- he -- he felt, you know, that m-my father is accusing him of get dr-\ndrunk, and then my father said no, no, you know. [indecipherable] fo-fo-fo-forgive me, I didn\u2019t\nmean like this. But he was afraid.",
        "A: When we got li-liberated.",
        "A: Well, we had another th-thing that ha -- that happened, that the few weeks, maybe three\nweeks before the li-liberation, suddenly Socha came with another person. And he wa -- th-this\nwas a -- a young man who was a deserter f -- he -- he was fighting on -- on the Russian side. He\nwas Ukrainian that fighting with the Germans on the Russian side. And he got to m -- he was\nPOW, the German t-took him in prison, and he -- he was a POW for -- for -- 1-1-in the -- Russian\nPOW in the German, and they treat them terrible. Th-Th-They tr-treated -- 1-it was unbelievable\nhow the German ter-terrible treat the Russians, the POWs. They tortured and th-the terrible --\nand wa -- one of the thing that they did that they forced them to fight -- to put the German\nuniforms and fight against Russians, against their will. And he -- he escape. Somehow he -- he\ndeserted the -- th-th-the German army, and Socha\u2019s wife sister find him someplace a-and give\nhim a hiding place, and they fall in love. He -- he was very good I|-looking young man, and the\nonly place -- and they knew the Russians are coming, and they knew that Russian will kill him\nbecause he fought with German against the Russian. The German, if they will ca-catch him, he is\na deserter, they will kill him. Th-The only place that he can survive, it will be in the sewer. And\nSocha brought him to the sewer. When he came and he saw this, he si-si -- he turn around, he\nwanted to run. He said, in this condition he is not living. You must be -- th-th-this 1s like a-\nanimals. You must be animals, no-not human being that you can stay here more than one day.\nAnd he 1-1 -- ya -- he was miserable. He only wanted to escape. And Socha gave a gun to my\nfather, and he said, if he wants to escape, shoot him. And they took turns, you know, every few\nhours somebody else was watching him that he won\u2019t escape. And this is how it happened to the\n-- til -- til the liberation.",
        "A: Tola. Tola. He -- after the -- I-I think after the -- the liberation that the Russian took him back\nto the army and he was killed in the army, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, Tola.",
        "A: We are at -- back in 11, because he\u2019s the 11\" person. And, you know, we heard already\n[indecipherable] the planes, the Russians planes were coming and he -- bombs were falling, and\nwe were afraid that the bomb can hit the sewer because you are under the ground, very under th -\n- under the surface, you know, and the bomb can hit the -- the street and you are exposed, and\nyou are killed. And this was -- this I remember I was so afraid of, whenever I heard the noise o-\nof the a-airplane, I would start to shaking, because I was -- I heard the bombs falling, I said, oh,\nokay, that\u2019s it. It was -- this was one thing that I was so scared, and after the flood, the rain.\nWhen I heard the drop rain falling, I already was panicked. And -- a-and then the Germans were\n-- th-they started to dig and putting mines above us. And we heard the digging, the digging, and\nwe -- we were starting, you know [indecipherable], but it -- it -- 1t -- it\u2019s gonna -- it started to -- t-\ntaking the -- the carbide that we used to the lamp, th-the disposed carbide they used to move to\nthe side when they heard the digging 1s coming. You know, the German were digging from up,\nand then we were filling from downstairs that they couldn\u2019t get in. But it wa -- it -- Socha came\nin, we said to Socha, and he -- he went ou-out to the street and Kowaliw, you know, wa -- he was\nwith the authority that he 1s the -- the maintenance commander and he said to the German, you\ncannot dig here because there is a gas pipes here. And th-they didn\u2019t want -- and he said le-let me\ntalk to the re-responsible person here. It was some German, some Nazi, some Gestapo, I don\u2019t\nknow. And he said to -- to him, listen, those are gas pipes, the moment you hit the gas pipes, you\nwill all blow up. Th -- and they stopped digging. This 1s -- you know, every day was bringing\nsomething, but it was to the end on the -- a-already, and you are so afraid that in the last moment\nsomething can happen. You suffer so much. And -- and we heard, you know, the -- the artillery.\nWe knew that the Russian are -- are -- are close already. We -- we heard -- we -- we were scared\nfrom the bombs and then, but we -- we knew they are coming. And my -- my father was ti --\nwatching Tola, and it was time that the shift was changing that th -- Mondek, the\n[indecipherable] was taking over and my father was so tired he went to sleep and I fall asleep and\nhe was asleep. And then, when he was a sleeping, it was like early in the morning, suddenly we\nheard the noise, like somebody is banging o-on the crates, you know, on the manhole, the -- the -\n- the iron --",
        "A: Grate, grate. I-Iron grates. And we were, you know, everybody was come, my father was\nasleep, he was so tired. And the rest was in the [indecipherable] was -- was listening and then he\nheard Heger, Heger, Corsage, you are free, you are free, you can come out. And he -- he said, I\nam giving you the plan how to go to -- each way to go. And he gave us to go th-through those --\nwe grabbed whatever we c -- you know, we had no-nothing, and we -- we -- we was crawling\nthrough those pipes til we came to the -- to the point that he said, th-this is the point that you\nhave to come out and if -- through it was the manhole, and he was open and he was standing, and\nhe said that the children are coming first. Then Mrs. Heger, then the women and then you, and\nthen the last is coming Heger, the captain. The captain is coming the last. And this is why -- how\nwe ca-came out. It was a courtyard next to the -- not far away from the sewers that we were\nhiding, above was a courtyard. He called all the people, and he -- he told them to stay and watch,\nand they watched like we were coming, like rats, you know, we were come -- and my brother\nwhen he came out, he started to cry. He said he wants to go back. He was so scared. He forgot\nhow the world look like. He thought that the whole life, his whole world is the sewer and those\nrats and -- a-an-and that\u2019s it, those 10 people. He was crying and he was pulling my mother, like\nI want to go back, I want to go back, and she explained to him in the --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: When we all came ou-out -- emerge from -- from the manhole of the courtyard, my father was\nthe last one, because this is what Socha said, that the captain is coming the last. And he -- he was\nso proud and he was smiling so har -- and he said to the people who are standing and watching,\nand surprised they were, you know, so shocked, and he said, \u201cThose are my Jews. This is my\nwork.\u201d He was so proud. He -- immediately, you know, he -- he went to the building and he\nstarted organize. The -- th-th-they were the empty a-apartment with the -- because the -- the\nGermans run ni -- run away. A-And he -- he said, this room will be for Heger, this is for Clara\nand [indecipherable] this is for Weinbergowa. He was the organizer, he set up everything, yeah.\nAnd then next day I think that he brought his wife and his daughter to meet us, and we met -- we\nmet them. It was unbelievable, 14 months.",
        "A: We were 14 months in the sewer. We emerge in July 27, 44.",
        "A: F -- f -- \u201944 I was -- I was end -- eight and half, yeah.",
        "A: I -- I knew the date because we were so anxious that, you know, everybody was counting the\ndays, and we knew that this is July. And y-y-you know, it was fu-funny thing, because a few\nweeks before th-the li-liberation -- it was maybe like a month before, or sa -- or six weeks, that\nBerestitsky, he woke up and he said that he had a dream, and he ask who is born in July? And\nmy mother said, July 23 is -- I was born July 23. And he -- he said that we will be -- we -- we\nwill be liberated in the day of my mother or a little bit later, that he had a dream, and he knew the\n-- the date. This why I remember exactly July -- July 27.",
        "A: We really were liberated July 23\", on my mother birthday, but Socha, during the liberation,\nthe mom -- he didn\u2019t come to the sewers. We -- he -- he -- he supply us with food before,\nbecause he knew he won\u2019t be able to -- to come, and he didn\u2019t want us t -- let us out. He was\nwaiting few days, because it happen in another city, in Tarnopol that after the German left, and\nthe Russian came, the Jews went out and then the German came back, and they all were killed.\nThis is why he didn't want to, he waited few days. That m-means July 23\" on my birthday,\nprobably this is when the -- the Russian came. This is what the prophet Berestitsky said.",
        "A: When we got out -- at first I didn\u2019t see almost anything a-and then when I start to see it was,\neverything was yellow. You know what, my -- my sight was terrible til my eyes get adjust to\ndaylight. And then we were -- looked so terribly, you know, th-th-th -- the dress that we were\nwearing, things -- we -- we looked terrible, because I remembered when I was on the street with\nmy brother, some woman, she -- she passed us and he brought s-some fruit, gooseberries. And\nshe had it in the bag and she looked at us and she said -- and she gave us, and he said ha --\nchildren, have this. Sh-She felt the pity for us. This 1s -- we -- we probably looked terrible. I\ndidn\u2019t look to the mirror.",
        "A: | -- | -- fi-fir -- I was skinny, th-this 1s -- is one. The second, I had the infection. I have like\nabscesses from malnutrition. I-I still have scars fr-from this, and my father was very sick, too, he\nhad a lot of those abscesses. And he wa -- he was very -- very, very sick and thank God it was,\nyou know, penicillin that was discover, and my father was a -- was one of the first one, almost,\nwho got penicillin injection. And this, you know, s -- bring him his health back.",
        "A: I -- I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t in such a critical condition that my father -- yeah, that -- with\nme, it -- it went through ba -- by themselves. They -- probably maybe I a-ate better, o-or --",
        "A: My brother was very skinny. He was so skinny that -- unbelievable is that his two legs were\nlike two -- two -- two sticks. And my -- m-my father and my mother, they both were, you know,\nthey didn\u2019t ke-keep straight. Their posture was completely, y-you know, it -- 1-1t -- it -- they --\nthey were bent, they had -- backbone was completely dismanaged. Th-Th-Th -- they were bent,\nthey couldn\u2019t -- being bent for -- for -- for 14 months, the only time they could -- they could\nstraight is when they were lying down. And it -- it -- 1t -- this -- th-th-they -- and sh-she was\nskinny too, my -- my mother.

        "A: I think that we f-feel -- we -- we felt that we, you know, are safe, at least fr-from the\nGermans, you know, that we made it, that you know, that we are liberated, we right now can try\nto -- to live normal life, and we had the hope, you know. It was very difficult, because no jobs,\nno th -- no -- no -- no -- no money, nothing. And 1-it was very harsh and difficult time.",
        "A: Ha -- I -- I -- I know that we were liberated in end of July, and in September, the school was\nsupposed to start, first of September is school year start and my mother went to m -- to the school\nand to register me and the -- the secretary ask my mother, you know the name, th-th-the family\nname, the first name, the age when -- all th-th-those details, and she ask what religion. And my\nmother s-said moisia showa. Moisia showa, it mean you are Jewish. And she looked at my\nmother, and she said excuse me, and she went to the principal to ask if she can register a Jewish\nchild. And when she came back my mother was so angry, and my mother said, \u201cDid -- did you\ngo to the principal to ask if you can register a -- a Jewish kid to school?\u201d She -- she didn\u2019t say\nanything, and she register me to s -- t-to school, and I started to -- to go to -- to school, but I -- I\nfelt very bad, and you know, because my -- I didn\u2019t ha-have shoes. My father made shoes from\nold newspapers and sh -- sa -- make shoes for me, cover ma -- ma -- my feet. And I had this, you\nknow, that -- this clothes t-terrible, and I fe-felt very bad. I -- I remember that I was running, I\ndidn\u2019t walk, I was running because I thought if I run that less people will see that I ha -- don\u2019t\nhave the shoes, only tho-those newspapers. And I remember one of the girls, she was sitting -- I\nremember her face. She was sitting next to me, one day she ask me why I am writing from left to\nright? Th -- I should write from right to left. I didn\u2019t understand what she is talking about. I came\nhome and I said, \u201cMom, why is she\u2019s telling me that I should write from right to left, not from\nleft to right?\u201d She said, \u201cBecause Jewish alphabet, Hebrew, you write from right to left.\u201d And\nshe knew that I am Jewish, this is why she was asking me why I am writing this way and not this\nway.",
        "A: Yeah, I was the only gi -- Jewish child. With m-my luck, I was almost always only Jew in the\nclass.",
        "A: No, no, no, 1-in Lvov -- we left Lvov in 45, 1-in I think ma -- March \u201945. This mean I didn\u2019t\ngo to -- to -- to s-school too long in Lvov. But I -- I remember very vividly. I study Polish, I\nstudy Russian, I had to, you know, say th-that -- by heart all the life of Lenin and Stalin, all those\ncommunist propaganda. And we -- we -- in \u00b045 March we escape, and we run to -- to Krakow, to\nPoland, because it -- in the Russian says that -- tha -- 1-1-1t came a law that P-Polish p-people who\nwant to immigrate to p -- to Poland -- because at that time, r-right now, Lvov 1s already Russia,\nthen y-you can emigrate t-to Poland. And 1 -- we -- we want in, and besides th-the Russian, you\nknow, it -- they wanted to send my father and us I think to Siberia because they found out that\nwe were bourgeois before the war, and this is, you know, terrible in -- under the Russian\ncommunist government. And th-then, another thing was th-they suspected that anybody who\nsurvived during Holocaust must be schpern, spy. This was -- this is why I remember my fa-father\ncame one evening and he said let\u2019s leave, and we left everything, whatever we have and we went\nto -- a-and we left to the railroad station, to the -- they were like cattle trains, and we stayed\nthere, we were hiding there, and it took us three weeks til we got to Krakow.",
        "A: Three weeks on this train that right now it takes few hours, because it was after the war, the\nbridges were, you know, des-destroyed. And I do -- I remember just winter, it was so cold tha --\nmy father was burning little bit water for us 1 -- like in the sewer, he d -- he did in the -- from the\ns-sardines, y-you know, a -- a can? He used to put some water in the warming, this -- this is what\nhe did there, too, that we will have some warm water.",
        "A: Yeah. It was another thing, we came to -- t-to Krakow, and 1 -- I went to school in Krakow\nand my mother register me already -- not -- she didn\u2019t want to register me th-th-that I am Jewish,\nbecause after the war they had still pogroms in -- in Poland. And somebody told her, you know,\nfor her safe, say that she is Christian, and my aunt, because during the war she survive, she was a\nmaid to a -- a priest, she knew the all prayers, and she taught me the prayers. I had -- have to\nlearn when I went to school that I knew when to say, what to say when I went to church that I\nknow -- know what to say. And I -- the -- the principal, a woman -- very nice woman, very nice\nwoman, she knew that I am Jewish, and she said to my mother, you know, for her sake, let\u2019s say\nthat she 1s Christian. And this is how I -- I was 1-in Poland, til I went to high school. When I went\nto high school my mother said that this is enough, now you are going, you are Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah, when we came to Krakow, you know, the people advise us th -- ya -- change the name\nthat sounds more Polish, not J -- Jewish. And we change from Heger to Herowski, cause\nHerowski sounds very Polish.",
        "A: They suspected we are Jewish. They suspected I was Jewish because wa -- wa -- one time th -\n- sa -- mothers of the few kids fro-from school, from class, they came to the principal and they\nask her if Krisha is Jewish. And the principal said no. And she said, why you asking? Because he\n-- she is too smart. This was their answer. That\u2019s really, you know, the-they always -- I\nremember th-the sign on the building across the street from us, Krishka [indecipherable],\nKristine, she\u2019s a Jewish. She\u2019s a Jew.

        "A: It -- it bothers me, you know. It hurt me, but after what I went through, I didn\u2019t care. I knew\nthat I -- th-this is it, that is anti-Semite, that I have to be very careful what I say, what I do. I\ngrew up with -- in this, the -- that I knew it.

We left, my\nmother -- my mother called my father, or g-g-got in touch with him and by train it -- or he ca-\ncame by car, I don\u2019t remember, a-an-and we left, because we were afraid that they will kill us.\nThey were running with the knife, and when we only c-came a day or two after, you know, my --\nth-th-th-the woman that we rented the house talked to my mother, we were walking and she\nthink, you know, Hitler, the Germans were bad. The one thing bad that he -- Hitler did, 1t was\nthat he didn\u2019t kill the whol -- whole Jewish population.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- I went few -- few times becau -- because I ha-had to go, and besides, you know, Poland is\nbeautiful country. The nature is so beautiful, the mountains and the lakes, the rivers, th-th-that 1s\nbu -- really beautiful. I enjoy it to look at the nature. I am not so proud and happy about the\npeople who -- who live there. I think that the new generation has a different view. Th-They are\nchanging. They, you know, are learning much more and they are learning much more about the\nJew -- Jewish culture. They are learning right now about the Holocaust, they never learn about\nthe Holocaust during the communist government, you know, the -- and I hope -- I hope it will\nchange. You can see the difference in the big city, like for example, in Krakow y-you talk to\npeople they -- th-they -- they talk the -- completely different, but in the small villages, I don\u2019t\nknow if it\u2019s so much change. And th-th-the -- the big influence 1s the church. The -- the -- the\nanti-Jewish propaganda is even still there. You know, the special thing that they are blaming\nJews for killing Jesus, for his blood and th-things. It -- even though the John Pope the second, he\n-- he said they have to change, that they shouldn\u2019t say that Jews killed Jesus, and other country\nare changing, but in Poland if you go to the mass, and I went to the mass to hear it, they still are\nsaying the same.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: This was because -- you know, my husband was born in Krakow, his whole fa-family 1s in --\nin Krakow. He went through, he is Holocaust survivor, too. And it was few things that he has to -\n- to take care of. Yeah, a-at th -- this is why he -- we went. But like I said, the country 1s\nbeautiful.",
        "A: I -- I live there from -- we came in \u201945, March \u201945, and I left from Krakow to Israel in 1957,\nSeptember 1957. So maybe --",
        "A: -- for 12 years. 12 years, yeah, I went to -- t-to school there, I went to -- you can call high\nschool. I started my medical study in the University of k -- of Krakow.",
        "A: They -- at that time, they didn\u2019t ask you, because this is already communist government, you\ndon\u2019t ask religion. Religion is not the subject right now. If they don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t say\nanything, but my friends, they knew that I am Jewish. They knew.",
        "A: I-In Poland, not. Eastern European, more woman, or equally maybe, or even more women in\ndentistry than men. The -- it wasn\u2019t anything unusual. Yeah, wh-when we leave, I -- I -- I want to\nmention to you that in 1945 in May, we got a news from Gliwice because Socha escaped from\nLvov after -- in \u00b045 to -- to Poland, too. He escape at --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, he -- he -- he dr-dreamed that after the war he will open -- he will have his own bar.\nAnd he moved to -- to Gliwice where Margolis live with his wife, with Clara, because Margolis\nand Clara they ge -- got married, and th-they live in Gliwice for awhi -- while. Helena used to\nlive in Gliwice, too. And we got a -- anews on May 13, it came a telegram that Socha was killed.",
        "A: \u201945.",
        "A: May.",
        "A: Yeah, th-th-the war, yeah, na -- May na -- nine, it was the end of the war. We got a telegram\nthat came from Gliwice that Margolis send us that Corsage died. It was in ma -- May 1946, and it\nwas shocking news. We -- it was like something falling fr-fr-from the sky. And we w-went to the\nrailroad station, we went to Gl-Gliwice, and h-he went to his home and to the funeral and he -- I -\n- | -- I think going, you know, to the -- walking after th -- his -- what that\u2019s called?",
        "A: The casket.",
        "A: Coffin.",
        "A: Walking a-after h-his c-coffin and seeing him on the ca-casket, 1t was the worst thing that\nhappened to me. And it -- 1t was devastating for all of us. We were -- he -- he -- it was in a car\nac-accident. He was riding the bicycle, and on the -- another bicycle was riding hi-his daughter.\nAnd in the front, approaching them from the fr -- opposite side was a army truck, a Russian army\ntruck, and the driver was probably drunk, and Socha saw this and he s-start to pedal much faster,\nthat he came in front of his daughter, and in the last moment the -- th-the truck hit him and not\nhis daughter. And what is unbelievable, that his blood was dripping through the manhole to the\nsewer. We u -- we couldn\u2019t believe it, and when we were standing, you know, at the funeral in\nthe cemetery, we heard that somebody said, this is the -- the punishment from God for somebody\nwho saved the Jews.",
        "A: We -- all of us were very close, especially -- I have to say th -- especially Margolis, beca --\nwe felt, you know, like a family. W-We, all those year til now, I am, you know, I -- in touch and\nI -- with their -- their children and with her -- their grandchildren. And 1 -- unfortunately\nWeinbergowa, who married Haskell, they lived in Germany, and they b-both pass away. She was\nvery sick. She s-suffered for depression and it was a very difficult life for her. And Helena, di --\nshe got married and she lived in United States, she has two children, and unfortunately she\npassed away, she had a heart attack. And my parents and my brother, they -- they lived in Israel.\nMy brother lost his life in Israeli army.",
        "A: It happen in 1978. He -- he was 39 years old, and he -- he -- he was killed. He -- he left a wife\nand two children. And my father passed away in 1975, and it was my mother who has to go\nthrough this. And -- but, like always, sh-she was very strong woman, and she live til her 90\u2019s,\nand she pass a-away t -- in January 10, 2000. From those all 10 people -- from all those 10\npeople who survive in the sewer for 14 months, and who survive Holocaust, I\u2019m the only one\nwho is still alive. And this is why I am telling the story, that I am the last eyewitness news. I\nwitness that, saw this, went through this and can say that I saw this, not that somebody told me.",
        "A: My father used to keep the memoirs 1-in -- in the sewer, he -- he used to write, but a-after the\nwar he wrote -- he had a -- wrote a -- a -- with his -- his handwriting memoirs and when he came\nto visit me in the United States in 1975, w-w-we force him to put his -- in writing and to -- to\nwrite this on -- on the typewriter. And I -- I went with my husband to lower east side, and we\nfound old Polish typewriter, and we force my father to sit and write it because we said, now you\ndon\u2019t have any excuse, you have the typewriter, and type it. And he wrote the m -- memotr, I\nhave the manuscript of his memoirs, and this memoirs are from 1939 til 1945. And after he wrote\nthe memoirs, when he went back to Israel with my mother, and a-after half a year he pass away.\nThis was like his last document that he put the all historical facts and mor -- everything what\nhappened to his family and the rest of j -- of the Jewish nation.",
        "A: We were 1-in contact with Socha\u2019s family, and a-after -- she died and n-now I am not in\ncontact with the rest of -- o-of the family because his daughter, she -- sh-she felt that we did\nsomething wrong, that we said about him that he was a -- a -- a thief. And she is holding against\nus why we mentioned this, but this was the truth, and this was very important truth, and the fact,\nand I don\u2019t want to miss any -- any facts. This is, you know, historical event and everything has\nto be truth. The truth has to be said, but I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t think that this 1s something negative. I\nthink that he is the no -- the most p-positive figure that can exist, and -- f-for us, for the survivors\nand for the families of the survivors, we always talk about him, and he is like, for us he is like a\nangel, like si -- like you know, sent by saint, sent by God to save us.",
        "A: This is difficult question. I don\u2019t know how to answer. I -- I am not religious, this mean -- I\nkeep the tradition. I ke-ke -- the holy days, I can light the candle, I pray, I say the Kaddish for --\nfor my family, for Socha. But my mind is very scientifical too, and those are two -- two fields\nthat are fighting either -- each other. I really cannot say. But I think that somehow it is some\npower, bigger power th-that we are. I don\u2019t know how -- how to call this. I don\u2019t know even if\nEinstein know how to call this. But something must e-existed. I-I -- I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: We left Poland in 1957. It was a time that the Polish government somehow agreed to let some\nJews to leave -- 1-immigrate to Israel. And we immigrate to Israel, my mother had a sister there,\nand th -- and her family and w-w-we -- we came to -- to Israel, we d -- live in Haifa. My -- I went\nto the kibbutz to -- to study Hebrew language, but I w-was in the kibbutz only for three weeks,\nbecause the s-study -- u-u-university started in October, and I wanted to continue my education. I\nwas accepted to the Hebrew University, to the dental school, to the second year, and I continue\nmy study. That wasn\u2019t so easy, from the beginning because I didn\u2019t know Hebrew, and no\nEnglish, but I manage. And th-th-then I -- I g-got married. My husband was in the army, my\nbrother was in the army. I -- my first son was born in Israel. I graduate, I have my practice,\nprivate practice in Israel for seven years almost, and then in the 1968, my husband parents got\nthe visa to United States, visa for which they were asking in 1945, in Krakow. They apply in\n1945, and they got this in 1968. And when we -- my parents-in-law didn\u2019t want to emigrate from\nIsrael, but they said, if we want, we can use this visa. We went to the consulate and they told us\nif we will not use it, then we will lose it. The entrance permit to -- to United States, and we -- we\nsaid okay, we will try, and we plan to come for two years and from those two years is already 36.\nAnd I got my license here, and in 1970 I started my own practice. I was teaching in n -- NYU,\nand then I started my own practice that I de-develop, and my older son, who was born in Israel,\nhe -- he -- he was -- he went in my footsteps and he graduate from Columbia University dental\nschool, he is a dentist. He was practicing with me for 17 years, and now this practice 1s heres --\nhis, because I, after 46 years of -- of working, and bending my back, decided to retire. And here I\nam in the meantime, when we came to United State, I have a-another son, and -- who didn\u2019t go\nmy footsteps, he -- he became a city planner, and he is working for an environmental p --\nenvironmental position he has. And I have -- both are married, I have two grandchildren, and I\nam happy. I -- right now 1-in the -- the 208, 1-1-in spring, my -- I wrote a book, and the book will\nbe publish in the spring in 208, about my experience and my life, and living 1-1n the sewer and\nbefore and after, everything will be in the book, and I hope that the future generation can read it\nand come to conclusion that you have to fight for whatever you want, and n-not to give up.",
        "A: My father\u2019s memoir are not translated, they are in Polish, and I am trying to tr-translate this\nbecause this 1s really a historical documents. He puts the dates and the names and everything in\nit. | would love to publish. Maybe after I publish my wa -- my book, I will try to find a translator,\nthen can translate it and publish and give it to the museum. It is, I think, I\u2019m not sure --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I think it 1s.",
        "A: Pm not sure. I know that they ask for it, but I don\u2019t know. I wanted to give it them a copy, I\ndidn\u2019t want to give them the original.",
        "A: Oh [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: It used to be green -- green color, and it\u2019s like, around the neck, it look like chanel, and it had\na short sleeves, and a little ba -- bit, two strings in the front that you can close the -- th-the ne --\nmake a necktie. And this is the sweater that I cherished the -- the most, and when I show the\nsweater to my son -- sons, they were at -- in my house once and I show them, and they -- honest\nth-they were so surprise, and I think what they said, Mom, you were so little. Because they\ncouldn\u2019t imagine that once is -- their mother was a child too, and the sweater is a reminder of it.\nThe sweater I-I donated. First I wanted to keep it for my kids, but then they -- they said, Mom, if\nwe will keep it, nobody will see it. You better -- and I know that -- that the museum donated f --\nasked for artifacts, I -- I give few already, and the sweater I kept. And I ag -- ag -- agree, and I\ngive the sweater to the wa -- Washington museum. And it\u2019s still there, and it was on -- on\nexhibition, travel exhibition in New York, and I took my grandkids to see it, and they saw this,\nthey couldn\u2019t believe it, they said ma -- Grandma, you were so little. But they were -- they were\nso proud. And right now the book that I want to publish, it probably will be -- have the title of,\nThe Girl in the Green Sweater.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know. I got so many things, you know, fr-from my other grandmother\nthat used to go to Vienna and bring me so many things. It may be because I saw my grandmother\nknitting this for -- for me, and when I look at the sweater I see her face, I almost see her sitting\nand knitting. Maybe this was something I -- it\u2019s very difficult to ex -- explain, that it had such a\nvalue to me, and I was a little child, and still I knew how to evaluate things.",
        "A: Usually everybody always said that I have very good memory. It was in the school, and even\nwhen I used to give deposition the first time that I gave deposition, this was in the orphanage\nafter the war, that I was [indecipherable]. And I gave deposition in 1945, and the people with\nwhom -- to whom I talk, they said oh, you remember so good everything. But what I think why I\nremember so well, it is like a carve in my memory, in my br-brain. Those are bad things and\ngood things that you -- you brang probably [indecipherable] and it stays with you. I can\u2019t explain\nit. | -- even now when I went to -- after s -- I went to Lvov after 60 years, and I recognize every\nbuilding, ever -- every floor, every park. Wherever I went when I was a little child, I\nremembered. We had the guide, and I was guiding him how to go and where to go. He was\namazed. He said, how can you remember those things? I-I a -- I don\u2019t know. I s -- probably it got\n-- when you are getting so involved in something, it goes so deep in y-your memory that it stays\nwith you. And probably this had a such impact on me, the things that I went through that is all --\nalways with me. I-I will never forget this. I-I live with this every d-day to -- from one day to\nanother. I live with my -- my story.",
        "A: I-It\u2019s -- it was -- you know, things that reminds me, it is like you have -- you get a feedback s-\nsometimes from a smell, fr-from a taste, from th-the noise. For example, when it start to rain I\nalways -- I -- I always hear the rain, because I remember what happened with the flood 1-1-1-in\nthe sewer. Is so many things that it -- suddenly can trigger your memory and you go back. But\nthe ya -- the whole life that the memory 1s working for me til now, thank God, that I-I think it has\na positive make-up -- po-positive feeling fo-for me, and positive way for my life. It made me\nstronger and made me look clearer, and made me be more careful, more observant and more\nhumane.",
        "A: The one thing that I have to tell are -- are about family -- my family and people that we\nsurvive with, especially the -- the Margolis\u2019s that we were in contact with. We talk about our\nsurvival. We tal-talked -- you know, in some occasions, something when we me-meet together,\nor some -- sometimes from nothing, sometimes that remind us something and we say oh, you\nremember this, oh you remember this. A-And -- and sometimes you know, some jokes. I still\nremember the songs that we were singing, the jokes that th-th -- my father was telling. And 1-1-1-\nit was -- this is thanks to my parents, they -- they talk about it. I-I know that some Holocaust\nsurvivors didn\u2019t like to talk about it. We talk and I th -- I think 1t was much better. We didn\u2019t\nhold it in and we di -- among us. We didn't talk to anybody else, but a-among us. We -- we -- we\nlive with this.",
        "A: I start talking to others, it was after the documentary. This was done by BBC, and after child\norganiz -- Holocaust survivors, the children who survive Holocaust, they had a meeting, I think it\nwas first meeting in \u201989, in Marriott Hotel. And it was like 1600 Holocaust survivor children that\nsurvive came to this convention. And so many people from media came, from all around the\nworld and people we -- we met each other, we started to talk and suddenly I felt free that I can\ntalk not only to my family but to the other people. And then I was, you know, may a -- I-I did a\nfew interviews with the different newspapers all around the world, even to -- to German\nnewspaper, to -- to Japanese newspaper. And I did -- I was invited to -- to schools and to other\nplaces to talk about this. And this is one thing that I really don\u2019t like to do it, but I\u2019m --\nsometimes I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m looking from different point of view, I think that the young\ngeneration has to be educated, and this is why I\u2019m doing this. Is very painful, but from time to\ntime I am doing this.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think so. I think that you -- you were very, very precise with your -- writing your\nquestions and you didn\u2019t miss anything, I think.",
