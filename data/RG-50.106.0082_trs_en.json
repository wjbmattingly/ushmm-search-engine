        "A: Well, my father was \u2014 ha-had in Europe a plumbing supply business, which at\none time arranged over parts of F-France, Switzerland and Germany. My mother\nhelped him, worked with him in the business, or was at home.",

        "Q: So, would you describe your family as upper class? I mean, your father sounded\nlike a suc-successful businessman.",
        "A: I guess everybody more or less describes themselves as middle class, and I'll go\nalong with the same thing. Yeah, I would say solid middle class. Both my parents\ncame from rural town \u2014 from a rural town, and \u2014 but then, as I say, had this business,\nwhich was first loca \u2014 was initially located in Freiburg, in \u2014 where I was born.",
        "Q: Did you live right in the city, or on the outskirts?",
        "A: We lived on the edge of the city, let\u2019s put it this way, in a re \u2014 in a residential\narea.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Was this in an apartment, or a house?",
        "A: It was an apartment, it was an apartment 1n a \u2014 one of the typical houses, cou \u2014 la-\nlarge houses, in which there were, I think, two or three apartments.",
        "Q: Was the neighborhood a mixed neighborhood, made up of Jews and non-Jews?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, it certainly was not a Jewish neighborhood. Since I left there\nby the time I was about six or seven, I really don\u2019t know very much about the\nreligious make-up of the area, but I would say it was \u2014 it was a \u2014 a typical urban area,\nand certainly not a Jewish area.",
        "Q: So you say you moved from that location at the age of six, so that would have\nbeen in 1931. Do you have any memories up to the age of six of the friends there, or\nanything that happened at that \u2014 you know, up to the age of six.",
        "A: Let me amend that, actually was 1933, so by that time I was eight years old.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 and so you started school in that location?",
        "A: I did start school in that location, went to primary school there, yes. I remember\nquite well, I \u2014 I do remember c-certain bits and pieces. I can vi-vividly recall the\narea, of course especially so since I\u2019ve visited it since then again. It was \u2014 it was a\ngood life. We \u2014 we had household help, and as I say, my parents \u2014 my dad used to be\ntraveling quite a bit as a \u2014 selling for his business, but my mother was home all the\ntime.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I would say nominally so, for the holidays, and went to the synagogue\noccasionally, or on Saturdays, regular Saturday services. So I would say sort of \u2014\nwell, how would you describe it?",
        "Q: So did you observe the Sabbath, did you observe Passover?",
        "A: Oh yes, all the holidays were observed, yes.",
        "Q: Did you have any Hebrew school training before the \u2014 up to the age of eight?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014 not \u2014 not that I recall, no, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Was there a large extended family, either or your mother or father\u2019s side?",
        "A: Well, there was a fairly sizeable family, not in a town where we lived, but where\nmy parents had come from, and that \u2014 since that was only about 20 miles away.\nThere was, by today\u2019s standards, a very close, nearby extended family. Of course, in\nthose days 20 miles was a fairly substantial distance.",
        "Q: So did you get together with them at special holidays and so forth?",
        "A: Oh yes, we often did. And in addition to that actually, one of my uncles, at times\nworked with my father in his business.",
        "Q: Was your father very politically oriented, or your mother at that \u2014 at that time?",
        "A: No, neither one, I would say, was either p \u2014 was really politically oriented or \u2014 or\nactive.",
        "Q: And were \u2014 were your parents Zionists?",
        "A: No, they were not.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: We spoke German.",
        "Q: So from 1925 to 1933, you were in this location. Is there anything else you\nwanted to say about that time, before we move on? Wh-Wh-When you were in\nschool, up to the age of eight, did you have any unpleasant experiences, or any\nunpleasant experiences in the street with other children?",
        "A: Ye \u2014 well, some, not very much. I mean, we\u2019re \u2014 we \u2014 since we left in April of\n1933, this was very shortly after Hitler\u2019s actual rise to power, there wasn\u2019t really all\nthat much. Yes, there were the \u2014 there was the occasional bully, but actually I ran\ninto that later on, much more so.",
        "Q: Okay, well, let\u2019s now move into 1933, and in January Hitler came into power as\nchancellor. And so, how did that affect your family?",
        "A: Well, on April 1, 1933, there was a boycott of Jewish business in Germany,\nwhich was actually one of the \u2014 the first centrally orchestrated anti-Jewish outbreak\nor outburst of activity. And we packed up and went off to Switzerland, where by\nthat time a ma \u2014 a major branch of the business was located in Basel. So in 1933, we\nwent \u2014 went off to Basel, Switzerland.",
        "Q: So from 1933 on, you were in Basel, or did you return?",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t all that cut and dried. We stayed in Basel for a while. As\nbest as I recall, we did not get permission to stay permanently in Basel. I remember\nNovember 18, 1997\nwe lived in a hotel for quite a while. And then we moved to France, across the\nborder into France, into Saint-Louis. Again [indecipherable] across the border\nfrom Basel.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. When you had to move, what did your parents\nsay to you, why did you have to move? Here\u2019s an eight year old child, how did they\nphrase it to you?",
        "A: I really can\u2019t recall. I really don\u2019t know. But to my \u2014 well, it was an interesting\nadventure. I wasn\u2019t that wild in \u2014 being in school, and I was being pulled out of\nschool, and off we went to Basel. So I really \u2014 I must admit, I do not know. I do not\nrecall.",
        "Q: Did this man Hitler mean anything to you at age eight?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure \u2014 I\u2019m sure he did, but exactly what he meant to me at that point, I\nmean, I\u2019m sure it was not \u2014 I wa\u2014 I mu \u2014 I must have picked it up from \u2014 I mean, I\nwa \u2014 I was receptive enough, I think, to pick these things up from my surroundings,\nbut if you asked me what I thought of them exactly, and \u2014 and what way it came to\nme, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself as a child? Were you very independent, or \u2014",
        "A: That depends whom you ask. No, I don\u2019t think I was really all that independent. I\nhad a \u2014 well, I\u2014I liked being by myself. I was probably rather introspective, and like\nat that point already, and this came out much later, we liked reading a great deal,\nNovember 18, 1997\nliked playing with construction toys. In other words, activities that are usually singul\n\u2014 done by one person. I can\u2019t recall ever having though, certainly at that time having\na \u2014a circle of friends. I mean, I knew people, but nose \u2014 no big circle of friends.",
        "Q: So you packed your bags to go to Switzerland with your family. What is \u2014 what\ndi \u2014 is your sister\u2019s name?",
        "A: Margot.",
        "Q: Oh, Margot. So you and Margot and your parents. Any extended family, or just\nthe four of you?",
        "A: No, just the f\u2014 no, just the four of us.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t remember this being particularly upsetting, having to leave\nfriends?",
        "A: No. As I say, I don\u2019t think I had a very large, or a circle of friends at that point.",
        "Q: And Freiburg is \u2014 1s not that far from the Swiss border. So what about the\njourney there, do you remember anything about that? And then where did you first\nsettle?",
        "A: Well, we settled for a while in the hotel in Basel. And after that when \u2014\napparently my parents did not get permission to stay in Basel, or they \u2014 or thought it\nappropriate otherwise. I must admit I never did find, never did ask. We moved across\nthe border to Saint-Louis, which is in France, and lived there. And I went to school\nin Saint-Louis, both my sister and I did, in a local school there.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: What was that like for you? Did you have any idea of the language in the\nbeginning?",
        "A: None whatsoever. Well, you know you, a-at that age if you get thrown into this\nsort of environment \u2014 the people there obviously do speak German or a Swiss\ndialect, or a Swiss type of dialect, or whatever you want to call the Alsace \u2014 the\nAlsatian manner of speaking. And so \u2014 but French obviously was \u2014 was \u2014 was\ndifficult, and we had a\u2014 we spent a limited amount of time in Switzerland \u2014 in\nFrance.",
        "Q: How long were you in France?",
        "A: To the best of my recollection, un \u2014 until late \u2014 sometime middle, late 1934. In\nother words, about \u2014 I would say about a year.",
        "Q: Any \u2014 any unpleasant experiences there where you would \u2014 did they know you\nwere Jewish?",
        "A: No unpleasant experiences to the extent that I know now \u2014 that I can recall, no.",
        "Q: And were you very close to your parents, did you have a very good relationship\nwith them, or were they open with you about what was happening?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Or did you not question?",
        "A: A, I probably didn\u2019t question it too much. B, I guess at that time already, my\nparents were under a great deal of strain, certainly a lot more than I was. And while\nNovember 18, 1997\none develops a certain type of closeness as a result, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not quite the same as a\n\u2014as acloseness which develops in \u2014 in tranc \u2014 peace and tranquility.",
        "Q: Were you able to voice your fears to your parents?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that I had any fears. I suspect that my parents probably were anxious\nto \u2014 limited my fears to the maximum possible, so \u2014",
        "Q: Did you talk things over with your sister?",
        "A: No, we were a little bit \u2014 we were apart \u2014 five years apart. I would say that\ncommunication is prob \u2014 was probably more \u2014 even more difficult tha-than with my\nparents, because the \u2014 the \u2014 the five year age difference between the youngsters is \u2014\nis pretty substantial.",
        "Q: So, after the year was over, then where did you go?",
        "A: Well, in 1934, I believe it was, the French, having received a large number of\nrefugees \u2014 at this point we had largely given up our business in Freiburg in\nGermany, and still had the business in Switzerland and in France. At that point I\nbelieve it was that the French authorities basically said to the refugees in \u2014 many had\nsettled along the border here, that it was necessary for them to go inland a certain\ndistance, or to leave. In other words, residence along the border was not \u2014 was\nfrowned upon, or in fact, forbidden. And so my parents really had a choice to make;\ndo they want to go inland? And is \u2014 if I remember correctly, I think the closest they\ncould go to would be the city \u2014 the town of Merceuil or, do they want to leave \u2014 and,\nNovember 18, 1997\nwhich would of course made pretty well impossible the business \u2014 maintaining the\nbusiness in Switzerland, and while he \u2014 to a certain extent, the business in France,\nwhich was also very close to the border.",
        "Q: So your father was still actively working at this point?",
        "A: Oh yes, we \u2014 we still had our business. And so we packed up and moved back to\nGermany. And we did not move back to Freiburg, we moved to a town called\nLoerrach, l-o-e \u2014 double r-a-c-h.",
        "Q: Is that near Freiburg?",
        "A: That is \u2014 well, everything is n \u2014 well, a-again, it\u2019s one of those things that today\nit\u2019s very close, in the old days it was quite far. It\u2019s only about two miles from the\nSwiss border. It was about three miles as the crow flies from Saint-Louis. In other\nwords, they were all [indecipherable] or not, at the point where the \u2014 the Rhine\nRiver makes its bend, where the free countries meet. It was about, oh I would say, 40\n- 50 miles from Freiburg. So we \u2014 we got back there fairly frequently, but it \u2014 it still\n\u2014 in those days it was a fairly long distance.",
        "Q: Was it hard going over the borders at this time?",
        "A: No, it was quite easy. A-Again, for a time we lived in a guesthouse, a \u2014 a local\nhotel near the swi \u2014 again, very close to the Swiss border. I would say \u2014 as I say,\nabout the mile. And then eventually moved into an apartment in the center of town.\nNovember 18, 1997\nAnd that must have been either 1934 or early 1935. By that time my sister did not\ncome back, or came back and then she was sent to a school in France, a \u2014 what is it?",
        "Q: Boarding school?",
        "A: Boarding school in France, and she went there. A place called Remy\nAchmont(ph). And I started going to school in Loerrach.",
        "Q: And things started to tighten up, and Hitler was gaining more and more power.\nDid you have a sense of this tightening up?",
        "A: Yes, at that point things obviously started tightening up 1-1n \u2014 in many different\nways. The business was still going, the German business was still going, although by\nthat time I \u2014 I think the \u2014 the main part \u2014 we-well, the \u2014 or no, I\u2019m sorry. There was\nno more business in Germany, the business was largely in Switzerland, and\nprobably to a much lesser extent in France. But we lived. It was a nice, large\napartment in a big apartment house.",
        "Q: Was your father able to go back and forth to Switzerland and France at that\ntime?",
        "A: Yes. To \u2014 whether or not he went \u2014 yes, I\u2019m quite sure he went back to France as\nwell, but I do know he went to Switzerland. And he would travel in Switzerland. I\nwould sometimes go with him, and we often went to Basel, it was the ni \u2014 the closest\nlarge city.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Well, now you\u2019re getting older and it\u2019s, as you say almost 1935, so you\u2019re 10\nyears old, and you di\u2014 when you would see signs on the street, derogatory signs or\nanything anti-Jewish, how did that strike you as a 10 year old?",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you begin to notice things like this, but one of the things,\nI mean, in \u2014 in that part of Germany, anti-Semitism wasn\u2019t probably quite as\nvirulent as it was in other parts of Germany. In other words, the \u2014 in the s \u2014 in the\nsouthwest of Germany, I think people were slightly more relaxed, and I think this\nwas true for quite a bit of time. And \u2014 but yes, there were obviously signs. I knew I\nwas Jewish, I went to a German school. I went \u2014 first finished sec \u2014 f \u2014 well, by that\ntime I guess I had \u2014 I'd finished secondary school \u2014 primary school, I was then in the\n[indecipherable] schule, secondary school. I had a number of friends, but 1t was \u2014 it\nwas obviously noticeable. One didn\u2019t count the certain problems. You had the\nnormal sort of bully.",
        "Q: Such as? Can you describe an incident?",
        "A: Well, I guess bullies are probably pretty well the same all over. No, not \u2014 nothing\nparticular. I do know that after the war I went back looking for him, but he wasn\u2019t\nthere any more.",
        "Q: Did they call you names?",
        "A: No, not that I recall, not that I recall. I was not, you know, a \u2014 it was, again, I was\nprobably rather introspective, I was not very good at sports, so even if, you know, if\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou \u2014 if they chose sports teams or teams for games and so on, I was usually one of\nthe last picked. However, I do not attribute that necessarily to my being Jewish. I\nsuspect I just wasn\u2019t very good at it.",
        "Q: How did you feel about being Jewish at that point, when you know it meant\ndifficulties?",
        "A: It was no \u2014 there was no resentment or anything like that on my part. I felt I was\nJewish, and that\u2019s the way things are, and I was perfectly \u2014 perfectly satisfied and no\n\u2014no s\u2014no special feelings about it.",
        "Q: Did you have any hobbies? You said you liked to read. Anything else?",
        "A: Well, actually, at that point, mainly I would say I liked construction toys. We \u2014\nthe family often went out for walks, that wasn\u2019t necessarily what I would have\nchosen to do, but that\u2019s what we did. No, no other great hobbies. I did have a \u2014 at\nthat \u2014 during this period, I ha \u2014 which actually lasted for a long time, I had a\nneighbor, next door neighbor, a \u2014 a young, a friend, an Aryan, German, with whom I\nwas friendly until we left eventually Germany, and he joined eventually \u2014 he \u2014 I\nthink he became a Hitler \u2014 member of the Hitler Youth. But you know, that was just\none of those things that one had to do, or did, and \u2014",
        "Q: So you felt comfortable in his house \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 did you go play with him?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah, he felt comfortable in our house and I felt comfortable in his. I\nhad some Jewish friends.",
        "Q: Was the school a mixed school? This was Jewish and non-Jewish children?",
        "A: Well, yeah, it was \u2014 it was the local \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] public?",
        "A: It was the local public school, and there was not a very large Jewish presence in\nthat town, yes. So it was \u2014 it was \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many \u2014 I suspect\nyou had less than one percent or two percent Jews in the school.",
        "Q: And the tea \u2014 the teachers treated you well?",
        "A: Some \u2014 I would say yes, I had a couple of teachers who were, I felt probably went\nout of their way to be nice. That actually came, I guess a bit later, but I had one\nteacher who, if you wanted to, I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know what \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I -\nmaybe I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in a minority. I \u2014 you can find anti-Semitism anyplace if you look\nfor it hard enough. That assumes that nothing bad ever happens to anybody who\u2019s\nnot Jewish. In other words, you know, a teacher can be mean, or \u2014 or you can\nattribute to anti-Semitism. On the other hand, they\u2019re mean to other kids as well. So,\nto answer your questions, it wasn\u2019t terribly bad, in th \u2014 I had some teachers, a couple\nof teachers that I would have preferred not to have. On the other hand, I had a couple\nthat in retrospect, I think went out of their way to be nice.",
        "Q: Was there a picture of Hitler in your classrooms?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh, there must have been. I\u2019m sure there was. Can\u2019t recall, but I\u2019m quite sure.",
        "Q: Did you have to salute him, or say heil Hitler?",
        "A: No, no, we di \u2014 we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: So when you would look at a picture of Hitler, any specific reaction on your part?",
        "A: Gee. Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of difficult to \u2014 to \u2014 wha-what one felt like at\nthat point. Obviously I knew my \u2014 my folks were having increasing problems. This\nbecame very obvious, a lot more obvious as my mother became more and more\ntense. My father was perhaps somewhat more relaxed, but my mother certainly\nbecame increasingly tense. So one picks it up, it\u2019s not very difficult.",
        "Q: How did it manifest itself with her?",
        "A: Well, a nervousness, a sort of a\u2014 she, I think, developed stomach ulcers, had\nother problems. But for instance for \u2014 I remember for stomach ulcers she went to\nSwitzerland to get treated. So it was still quite possible to go back and forth.",
        "Q: And now it\u2019s, let\u2019s say 1936, and you\u2019re just leading your life as it is. Did you\nhear about the Olympics then?",
        "A: Oh heavens yes, that was \u2014 I may not have been very good at sports, but I\u2019m a\ngreat spectator or listener, yes.",
        "Q: What were your impressions?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014I sort of had, I remember I sort of had mixed feelings. On one hand, I\nwas still interested in the German athletes. On the other hand, you liked to see them\nNovember 18, 1997\noccasionally get beaten. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I looked at it purely or primarily as a sports\nevent, not as a political event at that point.",
        "Q: Did you sent \u2014 sense any anti-Jewishness among, you know, permission of\nathletes to compete.",
        "A: No, at that time I \u2014 since I knew nobody \u2014 what I found out in the meantime,\nlearned in the meantime is one thing, but at that point I did not know. I mean, no.",
        "Q: What is it like for a 10 year old boy to see people on the streets in uniform? Did\nyou admire them, were you frightened of them?",
        "A: Well, no, and obviously didn\u2019t admire them. But one had a healthy respect for \u2014\nyou can call it fear, or whatever it is, yes. And of course, starting about 1936, then\nthings started getting tougher. As I say again, until 1936, it wasn\u2019t all that bad in that\npart of the world.",
        "Q: In what way did things get tougher?",
        "A: Well, then of course things started with \u00b037 - \u00b038.",
        "Q: What were some of the restrictions that you lived under?",
        "A: None that I can recall, that we had particular restrictions.",
        "Q: Did you have any curfews, or were you restricted to going to any places?",
        "A: No, but I suspect they was somewhere my parents felt they weren\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t\nwelcome, and we wouldn\u2019t go there. I certainly didn\u2019t know of any place. I mean, I \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997\nI \u2014 I was aware of course, then came the Nuremberg laws about then. I was aware of\nthose.",
        "Q: How did that strike you?",
        "A: Pretty weird. You \u2014 you \u2014 you begin \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say one begins to accept it, but\none lives with it, and it\u2019s amazing one does.",
        "Q: Did you think Hitler would eventually just go away?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I had any particular feelings about that. I mean, I would \u2014 I suspect,\nas I know a lot of people did, as perhaps my parents or my father did, and \u2014 but even\nthat he \u2014 no, I can\u2019t recall him expressing that, but I would \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have been \u2014\nwould \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he had.",
        "Q: Jews were then classified as second class citizens. Did you feel second class?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t. I was living in a slightly different world, let\u2019s put it this way. A\nworld that was not in the mainstream, but it was still at that point, normal enough to\nfeel that, you know, one \u2014 one \u2014 one just lived in a \u2014 in another group, which\nobviously was being \u2014 was disadvantaged to a certain extent, or being \u2014 being \u2014 oh,\nhow should one say? Considered not quite on the same level, but I tha \u2014",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t feel yourself inferior?",
        "A: No, I definitely did not.",
        "Q: Any particularly frightening experiences 1n \u201936 and *37?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, not that I can recall. Things did happen in \u201938 which were obviously\nfrightening, but \u201936 - \u00b037, not really, no.",
        "Q: Okay, now comes 1938, and it\u2019s the anschluss. Do you have any mem \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 recollection of that, or anything preceding that?",
        "A: Actually, preceding that, I guess I should say, I was sufficiently aware when the\nRhineland was being \u2014 being occupied, that my antenna sort of perked up, and at\nthat point began to realize that there were certain problems in the air. In 1938 of\ncourse \u2014",
        "Q: Before we go a little further into 1938, I \u2014 I just realized that your Bar Mitzvah\nwould have come in February \u00b038. Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 yes, yes, I did. I had a Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Please talk about it.",
        "A: Well, it was a Bar Mitzvah, it was in \u2014 in Loerrach. I remember I got a bicycle.\nNow this was obviously not the most important thing, but it\u2019s one of the things I still\nremember. Yes, and the other day actually, somebody showed me a picture of me at\nmy bar \u2014 taken at my Bar Mitzvah. So yes, it was the relatives, to the extent that they\nhad not yet left. Now, in the meantime I should say this: in 1936 or \u201937, my sister \u2014 I\nguess 1936, my sister left from \u2014 came back from her boarding school, and then went\noff to the United States. My parents sent her to the U.S., and she \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Ho-How did they get the \u2014 th-the papers to do that?",
        "A: Well, we had relatives \u2014 by that time we had certain relatives that had in the\nmeantime, left Germany. And we had relatives who lived here long time, and she\ngot her affidavit that way. And so she came to the United States, I believe it was\n1936. We had some other relatives, an uncle who left there. I think they probably left\nin 1937. My mother\u2019s stepmother \u2014 in other words, my grandmother, she left and\njoined two of her \u2014 one of her daughters. So the family at that point was leaving. In\nfact, the only ones that were le \u2014 staying behind was our family.",
        "Q: Did your parents say why they weren\u2019t trying to leave? Or were they trying to\nleave?",
        "A: Well, they were trying to leave. I think one of the key problems, of course, was\nhaving a business. The Germans were very reluctant. They were \u2014 they were\nperfectly willing to let them go, provided that they were sure that all foreign\nexchange had been repatriated to Germany, and exchanged into good German\nmarks. And to convince them of that, of course took a long time. So I would say my\nparents probably applied for a \u2014 for emigration to the United States probably in \u2014 I\nwould \u2014 my guess would be 1937 or early \u201938. One of the problems, of course at that\npoint is my father had been in the German army, had been wounded in the army,\nearned str \u2014 in fact, he had been wounded three times, he had earned the Iron Cross,\netcetera, etcetera. And as the Germans were wont to say, the thank of the Fatherland,\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou can be assured of the thanks of your Fatherland. And a great many actually, I\nthink, World War II \u2014 World War I killed a lot of people, and that World War II\npeople, who felt that they were safe, because of the big to-do that the Germans\nalways made about their World War I soldiers. In fact, the other day I ran across, in\ngoing through some of my father\u2019s things, a certificate. In 1936 he received a special\nmedal, which apparently at that point was being given to all former front line soldiers\nin World War I.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Gerald Schwab. And you were\ntalking about your father\u2019s experience in World War I.",
        "A: So, in World War \u2014 as I say, perhaps among former German frontline soldiers, the\nurgency, the feeling that they had to get out of Germany was not quite as great as it\nwas among the general po \u2014 Jewish population. But anyhow, by that time, of course,\nthen in 1938, a great many things happened. By that time the \u2014 I think it was\nprobably in 1938 that the French \u2014 the Swiss started restricting access to Jews. This\nis when passports were stamped with a big J, although that may have been in 1939. I\ndo know that my father started encountering problems of driving \u2014 of going into\nSwitzerland. About that time, and again I can\u2019t recall exactly whether it was before\nNovember 18, 1997\nthe events of November 1938, or after, Jews, the \u2014 the use of cars was restricted. In\nother words, things started getting pretty rough. In 19 no \u2014",
        "Q: Can we back up a little bit. I just was asking about your Bar Mitzvah. Were there\nany problems, did you feel any restrictions there, or were you able to celebrate it?",
        "A: No, no restrictions, we celebrated it. It was not a big festivity, but it was \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 I mean, one \u2014 one didn\u2019t \u2014 you certainly didn\u2019t do anything ostentatious at that\npoint. But as I recall, it re \u2014 it was celebrated and it was \u2014 we had a \u2014",
        "Q: So you felt comfortable going to the synagogue and participating in the service?",
        "A: Oh yes. No, no question about that.",
        "Q: All right, now \u2014 then Hitler marched into Austria. Do you have any recollection\nof that?",
        "A: No \u2014 well, I have a recollection of it happening, and \u2014",
        "Q: What was your parents\u2019 response to that?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure we talked about it. I\u2019m not sure we did. Keep in mind again, parents\nat that point were somewhat wary as to what they said to their kids. They really\ndidn\u2019t know \u2014 I mean, you were always \u2014 at that point, it had gotten to \u2014 by \u00b037 - \u201938,\nit had gotten to the point where one watched very carefully what one said, and had to\nwatch carefully what one said. Things change really substantially after around \u00b036 -\n\u00b037. And therefore \u2014 well, parents obviously alerted their children, as my parents did\nme, what I should or should not do.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Well, I mean, just watching what you do, where you go and what you say.",
        "Q: When you say watching where you go, such as?",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you obviously did not go to large demonstrations or\nmarches through town an-and \u2014 and things like that.",
        "Q: Were there many of those?",
        "A: No, not too many. No, not too many. Except the regional Hitler Youth\nheadquarters was about a half a block from our house, and I remember Baldur von\nSchirach, who at that point was the head of the Hitler Youth. Yes, I remember\nseeing him from a distance. The next time I saw him was 1946 in Nuremberg.",
        "Q: Was it frightening to see uniforms on the Hitler Youth?",
        "A: Yes, at this time you became more wary, you \u2014 you did. I mean, you started\nassociating it obviously with \u2014 with certain events, things that took place, fears.\nWhether you yourself experienced them, or others did. At that point you started\nseeing \u201cDer Stiirmer,\u201d Streicher\u2019s newspapers on display all over town \u2014 various\nparts of town. And so yes, at that point things started getting \u2014 getting a lot \u2014 lot\ntougher.",
        "Q: Did you see any physical incidents on the street?",
        "A: No, except, as I say, my one personal bully. But even that was limited. But yes, I\nwould \u2014 I can\u2019t really recall any physical problem. I do know that fairly frequently I\nNovember 18, 1997\nwould take different routes home, to get home, get out of his way and so on. I cannot\nrecall they were being attacked, and I\u2019m sure I would remember that. So \u2014 but you\nknow, the-there was a definite fear there.",
        "Q: Did you feel German at that point, or just Jewish, or both?",
        "A: Well, I felt both, I would say. Yeah, I would say you \u2014 you \u2014 you feel both. You\ndo \u2014 you \u2014 keep in mind, we did not have that large or active a Jewish population.\nThere was no Jewish area in the town. The number of Jews living in \u2014 1n town, you\ncould count on \u2014 on \u2014 on a couple of fingers. I did have, as I say, I had one Jewish\nfriend. He and I got together fairly frequently. I would say I \u2014 actually I had two\nfriends, one German, one \u2014 one Aryan and one Jewish.",
        "Q: But there was a synagogue that was supported by the Jewish community?",
        "A: Yes. The synagogue was supported, and we would often go to Saturday morning\nservices, certainly every holiday, etcetera.",
        "Q: What was Passover 1938 like for you? Do you have any recollection of that?",
        "A: Now you\u2019re asking something that I really don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: I was just thinking it was such a pivotal time.",
        "A: Well, it couldn\u2019t have been terribly good, because at that point my sister was in\nNew York, most of my re-relatives had left the country. My dad\u2019s ability to earn a\nliving had pretty well shrunk to probably virtually zero, or certainly not much more\nthan that. So it could not have been a joyous occasion, let\u2019s put it this way. And I\nNovember 18, 1997\nguess we said next year in Jerusalem probably with a little more fervor than we had\nin the past.",
        "Q: And then the summertime came, what did you do in the summer of \u201938, anything\nspecial?",
        "A: Gee. I don\u2019t recall any particular time. I was still going to school, I was still going\nto the German school. As a small child, when we were living in Freiburg and\nprobably early Loerrach, I used to go to a\u2014 a Jewish summer camp. But certainly\nnot at that point any more. So I probably got into a certain amount of mischief and\nspent the summer that way with my friends.",
        "Q: You said you had a Jewish friend at the time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you and he talk about what was happening? Was that something the children\ntalked about, or were you just involved in children\u2019s activities with him?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m \u2014 again, I\u2019m quite sure we were talking about it, but it was \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I\nw \u2014 I would say it was one of the subjects, 1t was certainly not the subject of\nconversation. But he \u2014 he and I got along quite well.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Peter Wyle(ph). Peter and I got along quite well, we \u2014 we played together, we\nmet after school, etcetera. If I recall correctly, he went to \u2014 I can\u2019t recall whether \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t go to the same school I went, I can\u2019t recall where he went. But anyhow.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Were you a\u2014a strong child? I know you said you weren\u2019t that much into some\nphysical activity, but were you \u2014 were you small for your age, or were you \u2014 look\nolder than you did?",
        "A: I was a shrimp. No, I was very small, yes. Actually I was \u2014 any picture you \u2014 I\nhave, it\u2019s hard to believe at this point. I was very small, yes, and very \u2014 and actually\nthe only \u2014I only started growing about 1941 - \u201942, yes.",
        "Q: All right, and then you started school in the fall of \u201938, and then comes kris \u2014\nKristallnacht?",
        "A: Then \u2014 then, of course, comes Kristallnacht, and the day my parents went off,\nhaving heard \u2014 I\u2019m sure having heard that men were being picked up, being arrested\nat that point, my parents left town.",
        "Q: How much damage was done in your town?",
        "A: In our town not very much. The synagogue was \u2014 the synagogue was burned \u2014\nwas \u2014 I bel \u2014 yes, the synagogue I think was destroyed, it wasn\u2019t burned or \u2014\ndamaged, trashed.",
        "Q: When you saw that, what did that do to you?",
        "A: Well, at that point, of course, one was getting used \u2014 not getting used to it, I\nmean, this was just one of many. But more importantly, my parents left Loerrach to\ngo to Freiburg.",
        "Q: With you?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, without me. I was staying in Loerrach, I was staying at home. And my\nmother came back alone, my father was recognized on the street in Freiburg and\narrested. And he was then off to Dachau concentration camp. Now that \u2014 at that\npoint, things were obviously very bad, so I was at home with my mother. Of course,\nat that time we were \u2014 school was no longer \u2014 you \u2014 Jews were no longer welcomed\nin \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the local schools. So that didn\u2019t particularly bother me, I wasn\u2019t that\ngreat a student anyhow. In fact, if I remember correctly, I probably would have\nflunked Latin in that year, if 1t hadn\u2019t been for that. And, but then yo \u2014",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t feel cheated out by not having to go to school?",
        "A: No, I did not feel cheated at that point, but as I say, my \u2014 my dad was now off in\nconcentration camp, and my mother and I struggle along at home. I \u2014",
        "Q: How \u2014 how did she cope with that?",
        "A: Well, under \u2014 under the circumstance I guess she coped very well, but she was not\neasy to live with, and I don\u2019t see why she should be. I mean, you know at that stage\nof the game, the \u2014 the woman had a pretty tough time. I mean, I had it tough, but she\nhad it a lot tougher.",
        "Q: Did she have enough money to \u2014 for living expenses, for food \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 was tha-that ever a problem?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, that was not a problem at that point. And then of course, probably \u2014\nwell, it was about the middle of December, about five weeks after, we \u2014 I remember\nvividly at getting a phone call at 11 o\u2019clock at night, my father saying he\u2019s at the\nrailroad station in Munich, and he\u2019s coming home. There\u2019s certain things that one\nremembers vividly, and this was one of them.",
        "Q: Had you any communication while \u2014 with your father while he was in Dachau?",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we knew where he wa \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 he may have written once, but we\nknew where he was, in other words.",
        "Q: Why had your parents originally gone back to Freiburg? They said \u2014 you said\nthey left you in the town and then the two of them went to Freiburg. Why did they\nmake that trip?",
        "A: To get away \u2014 presumably to get away, in the event \u2014 because word was around\nthat they were picking up Jewish males.",
        "Q: So they though they\u2019d be safer in Freiburg.",
        "A: So they thought \u2014 so they thought they\u2019d be safer in Freiburg, and of course,\nhaving previously lived in Freiburg, somebody obviously pointed them out to\nsomebody, and he was arrested on the street. And as a result, my mother, who was\nnot a very good driver \u2014 we \u2014 well, actually, she was, she had to drive home by\nherself. Come back by car, driving home, which must have been quite a \u2014 quite an\nexperience. About that time my father was no longer able, even before then, if I\nNovember 18, 1997\nremember correctly, he was not \u2014 no longer able to go into Switzerland\noccasionally; my mother and I would go. But of course, after that, no, that was the\nend of that.",
        "Q: What did your father look like when he came home?",
        "A: My father was in pretty bad shape. He had frozen le \u2014 his legs were frozen, his\nhands were \u2014 had frost \u2014 heavy frostbite. He looked in pretty bad shape, I remember\nthat. And \u2014",
        "Q: How old a \u2014 how old a man was he at that time?",
        "A: Well, at that point he was 1n his mid-50s. No, mid\u201940s, late 40s. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did he talk about what happened at Dachau at all? Did he tell you anything?",
        "A: Not at that point. Again, that\u2019s \u2014 you know, they wer \u2014 they \u2014 they used to be \u2014\nthere used to be a standing joke in Germany that where one man meets somebody\nwho has just come back from concentration camp, and he said, how was \u2014 his friend\nasks him how was it. And the fellow who was there says, it\u2019s great. You know, they\nwoke us every morning with \u2014 with Beethoven\u2019s Third Symphony, and then we had\na leisurely breakfast, etcetera, etcetera. And of course his friend said, gee, that\u2019s not\nthe way my other neighbor tells it. He says yes, but he\u2019s there again. So, you didn\u2019t\ntalk terribly much about it. This of course was the \u2014 th-the word \u2014 at that point things\nbecame terribly oppressive, and as a\u2014 as a\u2014 as a youngster you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you\nknew it, and you started \u2014 you lived with it, and you \u2014 that was \u2014 that was the \u2014 you\nNovember 18, 1997\nknew you \u2014 one wrong step might be dangerous to you or to your family and so on.\nAn-And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s pretty tough.",
        "Q: Did you feel like a child then, or did you feel very old because of that tension?",
        "A: Well, I feel I\u2019ve really \u2014 to go to \u2014 1n retrospect, I mean, we lost much of our\nchildhood, after, I would say from \u2014 from age 10 on, there wasn\u2019t all that much of a\nchildhood \u2014 normal childhood, of course. We had one interesting experience about\nthat time, and that is we had the Gestapo in our house. Now my experien \u2014 this is an\nexperience that this was actually \u2014 may have been shortly before or after my dad was\nin Dachau. We had our books at home, and we \u2014 they came in and started going\nthrough our \u2014 our books. And they acted just like CPAs did, and it was perfectly \u2014 I\nmean, it was a \u2014",
        "Q: The-These are financial books you\u2019 re talking about?",
        "A: Yeah. Our fi \u2014 I mean, this is what \u2014 this is what the Germans were interested in,\nof course, in our family. And so, you know, th-they were in our house, and they were\n\u2014I mean, I can\u2019t say pleasant. They were \u2014 they were \u2014 there was no problem, I\nmean, other than uninvited CPAs, let\u2019s put it this way. So, it\u2019s another phase of what\nthe secret police did, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it was the financial secret police, let\u2019s put it\nthis way.",
        "Q: Did they take the books with them?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, they just sat there and went through them, went down there. They may have\nvery well taken some along. But then \u2014",
        "Q: So now your father\u2019s back from Dachau. Did his health improve after he got\nhome?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we did have a non-Jewish doctor, if I remember correctly, who treated\nhim and his health did improve, but \u2014 and actually, I think he survived that \u2014 both\nphysically and psychologically, extremely well.",
        "Q: Was that against the law for that doctor to treat you, the non-Jewish doctor, it was\nstill okay?",
        "A: No, I Don\u2019t think so, not at that point. And then in 19 \u2014 comes 1939, and about\nmark \u2014",
        "Q: Wha-What did you do with yourself, since you couldn\u2019t go to school?",
        "A: Well, I guess the same thing I did during vacation. I mean, I played, I maybe went\nto a certain extent, etcetera. There wasn\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014 oh yes, I did go to \u2014 I went to work.\nThere was a Jewish printer in town, and I did \u2014 did some part time work over there,\ntrying to ki\u2014 my parents obviously try \u2014 I \u2014 tried to keep me busy, which was pretty\nvalid. And so I remember working \u2014 working there. This was a f \u2014 a family that I\nworked for, they had this print shop.",
        "Q: So this Jewish printer was able to keep his business?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, at that point they still were. This however, may also have been earlier, just\nmay have been in 1938, but I suspect it was probably in early 1939 that this\nhappened. And then in April of \u2014 about April of 1939, I went off on the\nKindertransport to Switzerland.",
        "Q: How did your parents arrange that?",
        "A: You know, we\u2019re still try \u2014 I\u2019m still try \u2014 I\u2019m currently trying to find that out. It\nwas a\u2014 not a large transport, 1t was \u2014 especially since we lived right on the Swiss\nborder, I remember I was picked up, I was taken by my mother, I believe, to the\nrailroad station, somebody there on the Swiss side, picked me up, took me on to\nZurich and so on.",
        "Q: How did your parents prepare you for that, t \u2014 and tell you that you were going to\nbe leaving them?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I do know I \u2014 no, I\u2014I really \u2014 I really don\u2019t\nknow. I have no idea.",
        "Q: And you \u2014",
        "A: We must have talked about it, they must have said this is probably the best thing\nyou can do. It isn\u2019t \u2014 since you can\u2019t go to school, there is no Jewish \u2014 no Jewish\nschool locally. There is \u2014 was no really that \u2014 terribly much choice, if you had a\nchoice, you know.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And how does a 14 year old boy react to knowing that he\u2019s going to have to leave\nhis family?",
        "A: Well, knowing that I\u2019ve \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t recall that. I know how I reacted after I left. I\nended up in a small, Swiss town, and I\u2019m \u2014 well, that\u2019s not even a good size village\n[indecipherable] in a tiny little Swiss village with a Swiss farmer who had just a\nlittle before that, lost his boy in an accident.",
        "Q: Had you taken anything special with you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No special toys, or books, or whatever. Did your mother and father say anything\nthat you can recall when they \u2014 when you had to leave them at the station?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t recall. Chances \u2014 well, at that point, of course, we all were trying, I\nknew w-we were all trying to get out. And so anything I could do to get out, and I\nhave just recently found something that somebody gave me, a postcard I wrote from\nSwitzerland saying please, check on \u2014 on \u2014 on the \u2014 the affidavit, which my parents\nneeded, etcetera.",
        "Q: How many children were in your group, leaving Germany\u201d",
        "A: That we \u2014 we were not a group, I was an individual. I was all by myself. No, this\nwas not a big transport, this was arranged \u2014 in fact, just a few weeks ago, I ha \u2014 had a\nchance to meet with somebody else, whom I got to know there, and they are\ncurrently trying to find out under what auspices \u2014 I don\u2019t even know under what\nNovember 18, 1997\nauspices I went to Switzerland. All I know is I all suddenly found myself in this\nlittle Swiss village with a farm family. And that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was tough. Here\ncomes \u2014 I mean, here comes \u2014 comes the city boy, and he suddenly finds himself in\nthis tiny Swiss village with a \u2014 out \u2014 out in the \u2014 out in the country, and it was\ndifferent. It was difficult. I was not \u2014 I mean, for a while there I \u2014 this must have\nbeen about April, March - April I joined them, and they treated me like their son, and\nit sort of reminds me of the old story, I treat everybody same, like dogs. Not quite as\nbad as that, they meant well. They meant extremely well, and they were very, in their\nown way, quite kind, but they weren\u2019t quite attuned to me, and vice-a-versa.",
        "Q: Did they have any other children?",
        "A: No, they had lost their one child.",
        "Q: Wha-What village was this?",
        "A: This was a little town called Munch Altdorf on Lake Zurich, about 20 miles\noutside of Zurich. And \u2014",
        "Q: And they spoke German?",
        "A: Well, as good as the Swiss \u2014 German Swiss talks German, yes. Yes, they did talk\na certain type of German, which I picked up and have retained. I stayed wi \u2014 lived\nwith them, and then it came fall, I re \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was the family name?",
        "A: Fuerst. F-u-e-r-s-t.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And did they \u2014 how did they respond to your Jewishness?",
        "A: As best they could. I mean, they knew I was Jewish. I was probably the first Jew\nthey\u2019d ever met. And there was obviously no Jewish family nearby. In fact, I don\u2019t\nthink that \u2014 well, there was a Jewish family, these are the people I met again not too\nlong ago. They were about 10 - 15 miles \u2014 10 miles away.",
        "Q: But when you got on \u2014 you said you were the only child traveling, and you\ntraveled alone to Switzerland. Who met you when you got into Switzerland? Or\nwas there anybody on the t-train with you?",
        "A: Oh no, there was somebody on the train, there was somebody who met me and\nthen arranged for me to go on. I don\u2019t recall whether they went with me, and I was\nsort of passed on from one to the other.",
        "Q: So you were never by yourself until you got to the family. Did you have\ncommunication with your parents while you were with the Fuerst family?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah, I would write, occasionally I would call. My parents had the\ntelephone yet. And we would be \u2014 we would be in touch. And it was \u2014 it \u2014 that\nsummer, I remember I agitated for going back to school. The Fuersts weren\u2019t\nparticularly \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say anxious, but they \u2014 they weren\u2019t \u2014 they \u2014 they just\nhadn\u2019t given it too terribly much thought, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 did go to a school locally,\nstarting that summer.",
        "Q: Did you work on the farm, and if so, what did you do?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh God. Well, let me put it this way, yes I worked on the farm. We did \u2014 it was \u2014\nit was a dairy farmer, he had cows, a few cows, about 15 - 20. And so it was dairy,\nwe lived across the street from the dairy co \u2014 the milk collection point. And yes, I\nwas supposed to watch the cows out in the field, wasn\u2019t very good at it. Couple times\nthey got away from me, and of course they knew where home was, and they just \u2014\nthe fee \u2014 and the Swiss village, the village in the center, and then fields around it, and\nlike most European farms, the f \u2014 the \u2014 the fields were sort of divided up. In other\nwords, your farmer would have one field east of town and maybe another one north\nof town and so on. So we had these cows out there and every now and then when the\ncows wanted to go home and nobody came to get us, the cows just went home. I\nmean, I was not terribly successful as a cow herder. And every now and then I would\ntrail the cows into town and shoo them in the other way around. I was supposed to\nlead them back. But, every now \u2014 and of course when they go, they won\u2019t go ina\nstraight line, which means they go across the fields of the neighbors and so on. We\ndid a certain amount of damage. I was not \u2014 I was not a great asset to the family, let\u2019s\nput it this way.",
        "Q: Did you miss your parents?",
        "A: Yes, very much so, obviously. I mean, as I say, these people tried very hard, and I\n\u2014I\u2014 you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 they \u2014 they did it, they had received no pay, they\ndid it purely in order \u2014 and I don\u2019t think they did it in order to get another farm\nNovember 18, 1997\nhelper, I mean, that was not their \u2014 that \u2014 that was definitely not their reason. If they\ndid, they sure lost out. No, they did it for humanitarian purposes.",
        "Q: Were they a very religious family?",
        "A: No, they were not. She was more religious than he was, but no.",
        "Q: But they didn\u2019t try to convert you in any way?",
        "A: They definitely did not try to convert me. And then of course it was there that the\n\u2014 the ki \u2014 the social center of a very small Swiss village at that point, was the\ncollection po \u2014 the dairy collection point, the local dairy, where everybody came\nevery morning and every evening to deliver their milk. So if there were any\nannouncements of anything, this impor \u2014 of importance, this 1s where it would take\nplace. People didn\u2019t have telephones. And, in fact, I used to have to go to the post\noffice to make phone calls home. And it was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I must say also, I had relatives\nin Zurich, so I had somebody that I could be in touch with, it wasn\u2019t that I was\ncompletely alone in that respect. One of the most \u2014 the things I remember most\ndistinctly, and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming\ninterested in history and politics and so on, cause I remember when \u2014 when the\nGerman Russian non-aggression pact was signed, I prin \u2014 I announced that this\nmeans ya \u2014 war in Europe. Then of course I few week \u2014 couple weeks later, it\nactually started. And the announcements for \u2014 mobilization announcements of course\nwere posted at the milk collecting station. This is where everybody came to. That\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas early in the morning when we got up and by noon everybody was getting on the\nlocal streetcar in a\u2014 1n a uniform. So, you know, Swiss \u2014 Swiss males took their\nuniforms home and their wife will sew them after doing their military service. So it\nwas a matter of \u2014 within a matter of hours that they had \u2014 could mobilize the troops.\nActually, the kids were mobilized too. I remember that at that point the swi \u2014 the kids\nwere organized through the school, and I think I was part of the group that was\nsupposed to help drive the cattle into the mountains. Judging from my experience in\ncattle driving before that, I\u2019m not sure I would have contributed very much to the\nSwiss war effort, if it had of come to that. But it \u2014 fortunately didn\u2019t. So I stayed\nthere, but as I say, there were certain \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we had certain, how shall we\nsay, there were cer \u2014 a certain amount of friction between the family. I\u2019m not \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know who \u2014 to whom to attribute it, I\u2019m sure I shared it, I probably was a\ndisappointment to them. I was not being ruralized very quickly while I was there.\nAnd so I think in December of 1939, I was move \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 were you still in contact with your parents once war broke out in\nSeptember?",
        "A: Yes. Certainly by mail, prob \u2014 also later on certainly, but I remember making at\nleast a couple of phone calls, yes. And then I was moved to another family, they\narranged for me to be transferred. And I was then moved to a family, about\nDecember, on the other side of Lake Zurich, up in the mountains. A fundamentalist\nNovember 18, 1997\nChristian family. They li \u2014 he was a \u2014 he was a gardener, and sold flowers and sold \u2014\nan-and raised flowers and so on. And that was a totally different experience. This\nwas a refined family. And again, absolutely no effort made to convert me. They bent\nover backwards to respect my Jewishness. And I stayed with them until May of\n1940.",
        "Q: Were you hearing what was happening during \u2014 during the war at that time, what\nwas happening in Poland, and others?",
        "A: Oh yes, I became an avid newspaper reader. Have be \u2014 have been one ever since,\nyes. No, no, I ke \u2014I kept pretty well up to date.",
        "Q: Did that put you more on edge, knowing what was happening?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well, you didn\u2019t need that, but \u2014 but obviously then. Of course, one had\nno \u2014 what was happening to Jews was not at that point front page news. It of course\nhadn\u2019t \u2014 also hadn\u2019t started that way, you know. Germans were still \u2014 at that point\nwere still encouraging emigration. And \u2014 but what was happening, yes, very\ndefinitely.",
        "Q: And also, while you were with the second family in \u2014 in meeting other people in\ntheir town, did you sense any difficulties cause you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh no, no.",
        "Q: You were fully accepted?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh yeah \u2014 well, I wa \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there that terribly long, but the family certainly\nfully accepted me. And I did not \u2014 at that point I did not go back to school once I \u2014\nhaving been up there. I think I helped them in \u2014 in their business and so on. I knew I\nwould be leaving quite soon, or I assumed I would be leaving quite soon. But no, it\nwas \u2014 it was my f-\u2014 in neither place did I encounter the slightest anti-Semitism or \u2014\nor feeling of \u2014 of \u2014 of not being wanted or anything like that.",
        "Q: So you felt safe in these two homes?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah. First one not necessarily very happy, but safe, yes. And as I say,\nthe \u2014 the second family was totally different. In fact, I think they continued sending\nme \u201cThe Watchtower\u201d for about 20 years. No, they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they were a\nlovely family.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what were their names?",
        "A: I was afraid you were gonna ask that.",
        "Q: Okay, itll come to you. So you stayed with them until?",
        "A: Well, then came \u2014 then came the next thing, and that was in May of 1940, my\nparents were called to Stuttgart to get their American visa. And I went back to\nGermany to also get my visa. We got back \u2014 I got back to Germany, it must have\nbeen about the sixth or seventh of May. We went off to zi \u2014 to Stuttgart where the\nAmerican consulate was located. I remember reading on the morning of May 10\", a\nGerman newspaper in \u2014 while sitting in the American consulate. There was a\n42November 18, 1997\nnewspaper it said that a silly be \u2014 it was a German newspaper, obviously. But this\nsilly rumor was circulating that Germans were amassing troops f \u2014 aga \u2014 against the\nwestern front.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 18, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab. This is tape number two, side\nA. And you had returned from Switzerland, and you had gone with your family to\nStuttgart.",
        "Q: Well, as I say, sitting in the waiting room of the American emb \u2014 American\nconsulate in Stuttgart, I was reading the newspaper, which said that foreign sources\nhad reported that German troops were massing on the western front, and the German\nnews agency had obviously said this was ridiculous. That was the day 1n which the\nGermans invaded the lowlands. So that was May 10\", 1945 \u2014",
        "Q: 1940.",
        "A: 1940 is right. 1940, and that\u2019s the day we got our \u2014 our visa. We then scooted\nback to Loerrach, stayed there I believe about two or three days. In the meantime,\nFreiburg had been bombed, the first German city to be bombed in response to the\ninvasion of the lowland; I think three planes came over. And we were then, I believe,\nabout the 15\" of May we were in Genoa, in Italy.",
        "Q: Wai-Wai-Wai-Wait, let\u2019s not go so fast. You heard that Freiburg was bombed,\nand you had been born there. Any thoughts, any reaction?",
        "A: Well, actually, we knew Freiburg had been bombed because the train took us\nthrough Freiburg, but you couldn\u2019t see anything. No, not \u2014 not particularly, at that\nNovember 18, 1997\npoint I think I felt this is a pretty good idea. It was not much of a bombing, as\nbombings went later on, as I say. Three planes apparently came over, and since any\ntime a place in Germany was bombed, it was bound to hit a hospital or a school, if\nyou listened to that, and I think they said a school had been hit. But anyhow, very\nfew people, very few casualties. But it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 it was \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel any\nparticular regret, let me put it this way. Interesting \u2014",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t feel regret about what?",
        "A: About the bombing having taken place [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, at that stage of the game, I certainly no longer felt like a German, let\u2019s put it\nthis way.",
        "Q: What did you feel like?",
        "A: Gee, I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I d \u2014I don\u2019t know. But anyhow, what was\ninteresting was tro \u2014 taking the train from Freiburg or from Loerrach. The train\ngoes a \u2014 went along the Rhine River, going north before it turned eastward to\nStuttgart. This was the border between France and Germany and of course this\nwas before be \u2014 this being the ninth \u2014 May eighth or ninth. This was during the days\nof the \u2014 of the so called Sitzkrieg and nothing going on. And you could easily look\ninto France. And the French obviously saw the train on the German side, and\nnobody did anything to anybody. Going back, it was quite different. Going back,\nNovember 18, 1997\nwhenever you ca \u2014 when you came to \u2014 near the Rhine, the train stopped, and then\nyou were bused to a place where the Rhine \u2014 no longer the border, or the train was\nno longer within view of the tra \u2014 of the \u2014 the \u2014 the French military. In other words,\nthey finally started shooting at each other a little bit. And this started on the 10\" of\nMay, of course. But anyhow, we went back to Loerrach. Presumably \u2014 I can\u2019t recall,\nbut we collected some effects, things had been packed already and so on, and \u2014 what\nhadn\u2019t been sold or given away. And we went off, over the Brenner Pass to Italy, to\nGenoa, and I think we arrived there about the 15\". Now one of the things that had\nbeen \u2014 we also did while we were in Stuttgart was, my father went to the Italian\nconsulate to get a visa for Italy. He speeded things up by making a quote, charitable\ncontribution, unquote, to some Italian charity, and he got his visa the same day. This\nwas on the 10\" of May. And by the 15\" we were in Italy, and by the 18\" we were\naboard ship, on our way to the U.S.",
        "Q: Was this a very stressful journey for you, the wa \u2014 going through ital \u2014 you know,\nthe Brenner Pass in-into Italy?",
        "A: Stressful \u2014 well, until you were \u2014 you were across the border, obviously at that\npoint, I mean, yes. You were stressful if \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: What were the border crossings like?",
        "A: I\u2014 nothing. I mean, it was \u2014 it was like any border, 1t was a border crossing in\nEurope in the old days. It was a fairly careful control, but that was \u2014 that was\nNovember 18, 1997\nsomething one was used to. In other words, the \u2014 the days of easy \u2014 this was not the\ndays of easy border crossings for anybody. And so they would check the luggage,\nand they would check the passports, etcetera.",
        "Q: Did your parents give you any advice about what to say, or what not to say?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure my parents did. I don\u2019t recall what it was, but I\u2019m sure they did. But you\nlearn, by that point, not to open your mouth unnecessarily, even though that was\ndifficult sometimes.",
        "Q: So you said you were happy to leave the country of your birth?",
        "A: Oh yes, very much so. Yeah, at this point, I mean, 1t may have been the \u2014 the\ncountry of my birth, but I certainly had no warm feelings towards it, that \u2014 that\u2019s the\nnature of the game. Th-The events of the past two or three years had pretty well\ntaken care of that.",
        "Q: Had your awareness of being Jewish intensified at this point?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that there was any need for that, or \u2014 or \u2014 I mean one \u2014 it was part of\none\u2019s make-up, and I would say no, probably not. But it hadn\u2019t decreased either, I\nmean, it hadn\u2019t \u2014 it had stayed pretty \u2014 pretty well the same.",
        "Q: So now you get on the boat to come to the United States, which boat was it?",
        "A: Which what?",
        "Q: What was the name of the boat?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: The George Washington. Good name. And of course, while we were in the high\nseas, Italy \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what line was it?",
        "A: It was a U.S. line, I guess United States line, I\u2019m not sure, but \u2014 and while we\nwere in the high seas, of course, Italy declared war on France, which would have\ncut that route off, so it was the last ship, or one of the very last ships to leave Italy\nfor the United States.",
        "Q: Were there many other Jewish refugees on the boat with you?",
        "A: Yes, I believe \u2014 well, there were quite \u2014 I would say there were a number of them,\nyes.",
        "Q: Did you all stay together?",
        "A: No, no. I wa \u2014I was too busy exploring the ship and so on. I mean, I was the \u2014 I\nwas rather inquisitive and there was \u2014 there was too much to be \u2014 to be explored, too\nmany things to be done, and so on.",
        "Q: Were there many other teenagers? You were 15 years old, were there many other\nchildren your age bracket?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. I mean, we were not \u2014 we \u2014 I \u2014I believe there were, and \u2014 but I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 really don\u2019t recall any specific group or people or so on.",
        "Q: What countries did the other refugees come from?",
        "A: No idea. Don\u2019t know.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: And so how long was the voyage?",
        "A: Well, in those days it probably was seven to eight days. Got to New York \u2014",
        "Q: What was that \u2014 what was that like to put your feet on \u2014 what \u2014 what had you \u2014\nbeen your thoughts on the United States by the \u2014 at that time?",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it was recognition of a new beginning, it was a recognition of it\nbeing something totally different. And 1t was \u2014 it was an on \u2014 a \u2014 a new adventure,\nlet\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: Was it very emotional for your parents to put their feet down on \u2014 on the\nAmerican ground?",
        "A: You mean at the very beginning?",
        "Q: Yeah, o-on \u2014 upon arrival.",
        "A: No \u2014 yeah \u2014 no, I think at that point they had cut their \u2014 they \u2014 they had\nemotionally cut their ties with Germany, with \u2014 you know, completely. I mean, they\n\u2014 they did not pine for the old country, let\u2019s put it this way. No, they \u2014 they were\nready to make the change and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were ready.",
        "Q: What was your first sight of the United States?",
        "A: I think it probably was the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island or whatever. But \u2014\nand then of course it did \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was all a \u2014a-\u2014 sort of a blur at that point. Of\ncourse, we were met by all our relatives, who in the meantime had gotten together in\nNew York. They als \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: This is wha-what day in May 1940?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What \u2014 what day in May of 1940?",
        "A: Well, it must have been around the 27\", 28\" of May. And they met us, and then\nwe moved in with one of my uncles and aunts \u2014 one of my uncle and aunt, who they\nhad come to the U.S. earlier, and that\u2019s where we went first of all.",
        "Q: This is in New York?",
        "A: In the \u2014 in New York City, in the Bronx. Very much in the Bronx, yes. And then\nit was a matter, of course, getting acclimated, or getting acclimated and getting used\nto this city. I mean, you have to keep in mind, Freiburg is a sm \u2014 1s a town,\nLoerrach is a small town. The places I was in Switzerland were tiny villages, and\nthen you had New York. So it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 it\u2019s a shock to the system, but not a\nnegative one, it\u2019s just a plain shock.",
        "Q: Did you know any English at that point?",
        "A: Yes and no. I did try out a new word on one of my cousins, took me down to the\nstreet and I can\u2019t recall what it was, we met some kids down on the street in front of\nthe house, in front of the apartment building, and I tried out another word, and that\u2019s\nwhen I discovered that that probably was not the appropriate one, because he just hit\nme in the side of the head. I got a nice big lump on the side of my head. My mother\nalmost fainted when she saw it. It looked a lot \u2014 I\u2019m sure it looked a lot worse than it\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas. But anyhow it \u2014 he taught me very quickly that words and language, necessarily\n\u2014 just because you know the word does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s appropriate.\nThen of course, I think we stayed there about two weeks and then something\nhappened to me that was probably of great value to me. I had another uncle and aunt\n\u2014an aunt. She had come to the United States already in the 20s, so they both had\ncome to the States in the 20s. And they were great outdoors people, they loved\nhiking. And they took me, within about two weeks of arriving in the States, they\ntook me out for a two week hike in the mountains, in the Adirondacks or someplace,\nand told everybody, or every one of their friends to talk only English to me. So this\nwas what we would today call deep immersion, and it was great because after two\nweeks I had a fairly decent command of the language. That \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it was\n\u2014 it was a little rough at the time, because you get frustrated in going through it, but\nin retrospect, or even at that point, I mean, immediately afterwards, or even at the\ntime, you recognize that this is the way to go. And then things happened fairly\nquickly after the \u2014 went in fairly rapid succession. I remember my mother went to\nwork in one of the New York sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where\none of my aunts worked, and she \u2014 that was her first job. That\u2019s one the real, I\nwouldn\u2019t say untold stories, but it\u2019s one of the things that I must say we have not\ngiven quite enough recognition to it, although I\u2019m sure it happens even today that\nsome of these people make these changes and they\u2019re tremendous. I mean, adapted in\nNovember 18, 1997\nways that is unimaginable perhaps to us today. Although I\u2019m sure that a lot of ref \u2014\nother refugees, refugees today, who may be doing the same thing I do. Anyhow, my\nmother went to \u2014 did this \u2014 did \u2014 became a sewing machine operator. And then we\nmoved to Long Branch, New Jersey, where I went to school, and my mother and\nfather worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family, with a New\nYork lawyer. And, now, it was amazing that my mother could do it, but the fact that\nmy father suddenly became a sort of handymaid \u2014 handyman-chauffeur and jack-of-\nall-trades was also quite amazing. And we stayed there, I remember I went to school\nthere. I \u2014",
        "Q: Were you accepted by the other children?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t tease you about an accent?",
        "A: Well, well, no. One reason of course was when you enter a school at the middle of\nthe year and so on, and most of these schools, there are already groups and cliques,\nyou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re pretty well on your own. Kids don\u2019t really take terribly much notice\nof you, unless you want to be noticed.",
        "Q: Were you hearing about what was happening in Europe?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, at that point I certainly did. I was an avid newspaper reader,\nlistening to the radio and so on. Beside going to school, I worked. I became a \u2014\nsetting up pins in a bowling alley. Those were the days before the automatic\nNovember 18, 1997\npinsetters. Broke a finger in the process, you catch it between two bowling balls. It\nwas a fairly dangerous sport. I worked on the beach in Long Branch, dishing out ice\ncream during the summer. That sort of thing. And then my parents, I think this\nfamily no longer could afford a couple \u2014 he \u2014 they were \u2014 he had once run as ri \u2014\ncongressman in a \u2014 for congress in a heavily democratic district in New York \u2014 of\ncourse, he was a republican, so he only ran, he never did get \u2014 he didn\u2019t get elected.\nHe was \u2014 they were \u2014 seemed to be very nice people. And at that point my parents\nthen went and went to a training school, run by either the Joint or somebody like\nthat, and they became farmers. They became in poultry farming. Now this wasn\u2019t\nquite as wi \u2014 far removed as being a butler and a handyman, because my parents, the\ntown they had come from, the parents, the \u2014 their parents were involved in \u2014 in cattle\ndealing and so on. So it was a farm community. And lo and behold, after they \u2014 they\ndid this and I think they went through training, there was a training unit near\n[indecipherable] New Jersey, and \u2014 or Bound Brook, New Jersey. And after that,\nthey \u2014 with the aid of \u2014 of the Joint, they bought a poultry farm in a place, in\nCranberry, New Jersey, which is next to Hightstown, which is near Princeton.\nAnd that was in 19 \u2014 that must have been in 19 early \u201840 \u2014I guess late \u201840 \u2014 middle\n\u00b041. And they then \u2014 I went to school there, and they had the poultry farm there. I\nwent to Hightstown first \u2014 well, now I actually \u2014 I guess I went to Hightstown\nHigh. Must have been in the fall of 19 \u2014 hm. No, we \u2014 yeah, must have been in\nNovember 18, 1997\nspring of 1941, because we were already there when the war broke out. Well, it \u2014\ncertainly in \u201941. I went to high school there, had a \u2014 you know, I was \u2014 I was a new\nkid in town, it was pleasant enough. I went to Hightstown High. Had no untoward\nexperiences there except apparently the English teacher told another class that she\ndidn\u2019t believe what I was saying about having left Germany in 1940, because my\nEnglish was too good. And we were then there in June of \u2014 I remember in June of\n1941 when the war broke out with the Russians. The German-Russian was broke out.\nI believe that\u2019s where we were. Anyhow, in 19 \u2014 some time in 1941 because I do\nremember distinctly where I was on Pearl Harbor Day. And my folks then ran this\nfarm, which at that time \u2014 this was the days before the cholesterol scare, and reduced\nmeat production, so the egg business became a very \u2014 quite a good one.",
        "Q: And did you work on the farm with them, or did you just go to school?",
        "A: Oh no, I\u2014I did work on the farm.",
        "Q: And any connection with family back in Europe?",
        "A: No. At that point we really had \u2014 no, we were very fortunate. We had no close\nfamily in Europe any more. We were basically the last ones to get out. I mean, there\nwere obviously family and acquaintances, but no close family, and there was no\ncontact with anybody any more, but \u2014",
        "Q: So then life continued on with you til you graduated from high school?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, I actually had two years of high school. I \u2014 til 1943. At that point my father\nprevailed upon the local draft board not to draft me because I was needed for farm\nwork. And before too long I decided I looked like I was gonna miss the war, which I\ndid not want to miss. And I went to the draft board and says, I\u2019m ready. And actually\nthen was called up and went \u2014 went off in \u2014 in middle of 1944. Joined the briga \u2014\njoined the army, basic training, Camp Blanding, Florida.",
        "Q: Were you a citizen at this point?",
        "A: No, I got my citizenship I think in Jacksonville, Florida while in the army, while\nin basic training. It was a \u2014 a-any day that you could get out of basic training was a\nday won. So, you know, it was great becoming an American citizen, it was equally\ngreat to get out of one day of basic training.",
        "Q: How did it feel to put on an American army uniform, after you had escaped from\nEurope?",
        "A: Oh, it felt great, it felt absolutely great. I later on wore it back to \u2014 even though it\n\u2014 well, we\u2019ll get to that later, but anyhow I \u2014 I did wear it back to Loerrach, in the \u2014\neven though that was in the French zone. I wore it in Switzerland. Oh yes, it was \u2014 it\nwas great.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve completed basic training, and then what?",
        "A: Well, then I c-completed basic training, I was supposed to go out and suddenly\nthe army just ad \u2014 I was asked, just as we were shipping out to basic training, I was\nNovember 18, 1997\na-a-asked where my second pair of glasses were. Well, the army had issued me one\npair, but I had never gotten a second pair. And I was heartbroken to find that I could\nnot ship out with \u2014 with the people I trained with. They me \u2014 they were sent overseas\nand before long they were caught in the Battle of the Bulge. I, on the other hand,\nstayed around for two more weeks. At that time they didn\u2019t have this one hour\neyeglass service, otherwise I would have also been probably in the Battle of the\nBulge. And I got, about two weeks later, I \u2014 my second pair of metal rimmed glasses,\nand I was off to Italy, and became a member of the 10\" Mountain Division. And as I\nsay, joined the 10\" Mountain Division and was in the 87\" regiment, E company, and\nsaw combat with them in northern Italy.",
        "Q: So y-y-you were actually in combat, you said.",
        "A: Yes, yes. [indecipherable] We ended up, after the war, or when the war was\nover, we were in northern Italy. We were in \u2014 on Lake Garda when the war was\nover. And about five days later, while sort of trying to recuperate from what had\nbeen a fairly strenuous few weeks, I got orders to go down the Fifth Army\nheadquarters, where I became an interpreter.",
        "Q: What was \u2014 do you think your experience in combat was different because of\nwhere you had come from, what you brought with you \u2014 you know, your experience\nwith the Germans.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, my experience in combat was different because we had a crazy command \u2014\nbattalion commander, who decided that patrols going out at night would be greatly\nenhanced by having a German speaker with them. And regrettably, we only had two\nmen in the battalion who spoke good German. So either he or \u2014 or I went out in most\npatrols at night. I mean, I \u2014 I would go out and patrol with our own comp \u2014 for \u2014 for\nme \u2014 patrol for my own company, and for other companies. And then he had an\naccident and shot himself, or shot ca \u2014 shot himself through the hand, so then there\nwas one of us. So I never needed to use \u2014 or never did use my German in patrol at\nnight. But the experience, yes, I had a few interesting incidents. I mean, one\nparticular thing, we were the first unit to cross the Po River in northern Italy and\nmarching along either side of the road with the \u2014 1n \u2014 1n \u2014 sort of in a ditch, and I was\nat the head. I must say, I didn\u2019t volunteer for these things, I usually was volunteered.\nAnd a bicycle rider came down the middle of the street, uniform, and coming\ntowards us. And he came and came bef \u2014 I thought somebody was going to shoot the\npoor guy, because he obviously didn\u2019t know what was going on. And finally I\njumped out of the ditch and went up and in my best German stopped him. And he\nstarted arguing with me in German because the 10\" Mountain uniforms were very\nmuch like German parachuter uniforms, and he thought he had encountered another\namer \u2014 German unit, and he was telling me that he had a very important message for\nthe commanding general. Well, we were obviously very interested in that. And \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: So you captured him?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. And so we \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, there were some incidents like\nthat, but \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: W-Were you involved in actual fighting?",
        "A: I-",
        "Q: Were you involved in actual fighting?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I \u2014 I ended up with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the\ninfantryman\u2019s badge, and all this sort of thing. Which was actually the nicest thing\nyou could get in the U.S. Army, in \u2014 if you had to be in combat, because it meant 10\ndollars a month more in your pay.",
        "Q: Did you take any German life? Did you take any German life? Did you shoot at\nany Germans?",
        "A: Did I that I know of? You know, war very frequently is, except for hand to hand\ncombat, which we did not get into, war is very impersonal. So to answer your\nquestion, I don\u2019t know. But that wouldn\u2019t have bothered me one iota. But no, we\nthen, as I say, after the war was over, I got transferred to \u2014 I was told to go on detail\nto Fifth Army headquarters and there I became the \u2014 one of the interpreters in Mark\nClark \u2014 General Mark Clark\u2019s staff.",
        "Q: What city 1s this?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 this was on \u2014 in Gardone Riviera, right on Lake Garda, one of these\ngreat big magnificent hotels. Three months of it, a real tough life. And they had a\nGerman general staff unit there. The Colonel Schweinitz was in charge. This was a\nGerman unit that was responsible for getting the Germans out of the northern Italian\nAlps to surrender, and to organize it. And so they had \u2014 they had a staff there, and I\nwas basically the interpreter between the Americans and the Germans there.\nAmerican units and German units.",
        "Q: You are what, 20 years old now?",
        "A: Yeah, I was \u2014",
        "Q: And you are interrogating these German officers?",
        "A: No, I was \u2014",
        "Q: Or transla \u2014 translating.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was translating actually. I was \u2014 I was interpreting between them and\nyou know, they\u2019re pretty high level in the German army, and they often wanted to\nknow why I spoke such good German. I made absolutely no secret of it, and it was\nan interesting sp \u2014 probably the funniest experience there was, sitting once in the car\nbetween two \u2014 two generals, and at that time I\u2019m [indecipherable] I mean, I had\nbeen promoted at that point to private first class. And I suddenly burst out laughing.\nNow, one doesn\u2019t do that when one is a PFC between two generals, but I \u2014 I burst\nout laughing, and they both wanted to know why. And I said, well, it\u2019s a pretty silly\nNovember 18, 1997\n\u2014 funny situation, because the one man on my left was the German chief cha \u2014 chief\nchaplain of the German army in Italy, and the guy on the right was the chief chaplain\nof the American army. And I basically said, you know, it\u2019s kind of [indecipherable]\nto have a little Jew in between you, and you need me to get together. So that was one\nof the more \u2014 that was \u2014 that happened during that period. My German was good, but\nit was certainly not technically all that great. It was, you know, 15 year old boy\u2019s\nGerman. But it got me into some interesting places like the German underground\ncommunications facilities in Verona, where all the German telephone lines and so\non came together. Then one side you had the chief American engineers and the\nGerman engineers and I was in between. Fortunately, when it came to technical\nterms they were able to \u2014 to communicate without me. I sort of filled in the gaps in\nbetween. But I was there for three months, and then was transferred to a \u2014 to\nsomething called USDIC, United States Detailed Interrogation Center. This was a \u2014\nan interrogation group, which at that point was located in Verona, Italy, and from\nItaly we then transferred and we moved to Austria, town like \u2014 the name of\nGmunden in upper Austria, where we set up an interrogation center. And most\neverybody in that unit spoke German, or a great many spoke German. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were many of them refugees like you?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. I mean, the United States didn\u2019t have all that many people at that\npoint who were pro \u2014 sufficiently proficient in English and German, and knew\nNovember 18, 1997\nsomething about German army, you know, ger \u2014 you know. And the USDIC in\nGmunden was set up to this interrogation center, held VIP or medium VIP prisoners\nfor interrogation. They were interrogated there, and we had a large number of cells.\nAnd I guess I\u2019m not revealing any mo \u2014 anything that\u2019s secret any more, but at that\npoint, we had concealed microphones built into the individual cells, and I spent most\nof my time sitting with earphones, listening to these conversations, or recording\nthem. Some of them were \u2014 some of them were quite interesting. And so I spent \u2014\nthat started about July 1940 \u2014 or must have been August, I guess, 1945, so \u2014 in\nAustria.",
        "Q: When you say they were interesting conversations, can you say anything about\nthat, or you\u2019d rather not?",
        "A: Well, it got pretty crude when you have two female German youth leaders talking\nabout their sex life, for instance, or \u2014 all sorts of things.",
        "Q: Did they talk about Jews at all?",
        "A: No, at this point they didn\u2019t. Not \u2014 not really. There was nothing \u2014 it was basically\nmaterial that you wanted to give \u2014 provide to the interrogators, to probe, and so on.",
        "Q: What was your response after the war when you learned of what had happened to\nthe Jews, and the camps had been opened?",
        "A: Well, at that point of course, we had \u2014 near where we were, we had Ebensee, the\ncamp. Mauthausen was not too far away. Oh, I guess, what can you describe it?\nNovember 18, 1997\nAnger, frustration, rage, you name it. I must say that this \u2014 I had great problems as\nfar as the Austrian concerned. In my book I once wrote that what took Germans six\nyear \u2014 t-t-took six years to establish certain measures against the Jews, the Austrians\nwere able to do in six weeks. And it was \u2014 w-we got \u2014 the whole unit, I would say,\ngot pretty sick and tired of being told how glad they were to see us, and how they\nhad suffered under the Germans, and so on.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab. This is tape number two, side\nB.",
        "A: In fact, we had a theater in town, in Gmunden, which was alternately being used\nby the Austrian population, a movie theater, and also for plays, and as a movie house\nfor the American troops, the 10\" Armored Division was in the area. And we finally\nin \u2014 in \u2014in\u2014in the USDIC we finally got sick and tired of being told of how the\nAustrians had suffered, that we found a newsreel of Germans \u2014 troops marching into\nGmunden, and we told the projectionist to play it in connection, without any\ncomment, in connection with the next time he was \u2014 had a movie showing for the\nlocal audience. And it was interesting, it \u2014 word got around town very, very quickly,\nand we didn\u2019t hear this for quite awhile any more.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Then you stayed in that location for how long?",
        "A: Well, I stayed there until December 1945. At that time I got, on two days\u2019 notice I\nwas told I could go back to the U.S. on R and R, rest and recuperation. I had the\nrequisite number of points. You \u2014 you were given points by \u2014 for \u2014 for overseas duty\nand combat and so on, and they were taking people back to the States for rest and\nrecuperation. So off I went and came back to the States, surprised my folks, and then\nwent back. In the meantime I had decided I wanted to go to work at one of the war\ncrimes trials. And \u2014",
        "Q: You decided this? Y-You say, y-you made the decision. Why? What brought you\nto that decision, or what factors entered into that?",
        "A: Well, I decided it would be a fairly interesting closure. I mean, it would be an\ninteresting experience. And it would be the sort of thing I wanted to do. Now, I did\nha \u2014 well, I -",
        "Q: Was this from a historical prospective, or emotional prospective?",
        "A: I would say both. It was both. But when I got to the States, and I remember I got\nback to Fort Dix, ready to get on the next ship to go back overseas, I was told, I\u2019m\nsorry, you will re \u2014 you can\u2019t go back overseas. Why not? He says, well, the \u2014 with\nthe war over in the Far East, and all this sort of thing, the only way you can go back\noverseas 1s 1f you re-enlist. Otherwise, you can\u2019t go back. Well, I wanted to go back\npretty badly, I wanted to go back to my unit. And so I did something in a moment of\nNovember 18, 1997\nyouthful exuberance, I re-enlisted, and signed up, and they changed the orders and\nthey \u2014 I said, you \u2014 they \u2014 go back. And I went back, came back overseas. Got to\nCherbourg, and there they had me going to some other unit in northern Germany or\nsomeplace, and I screamed and yelled as much as a \u2014 at that point I\u2019'd been promoted\nto corporal \u2014 as much a corporal can do. And they said all right, they finally \u2014 I\nremember, I think I had to change a couple hundred orders, because they had about a\nhundred, couple hundred people on \u2014 on these orders to a certain place, and I had to\ngo through each and every one of them and rule out my name; they let me do that.\nAnd so they sent me back, they said fine, you can go back to your unit in Austria.\nAnd I got to Paris and in Paris I stayed at the enlisted men\u2019s billets in Paris, and\nthis was \u2014 the gods really took kindly to me because when I was \u2014 I stayed there for\ntwo days, and I was then ready to go back to Austria. I tried to get my duffel bag,\nand lo and behold, it had been stolen. Now this wouldn\u2019t normally be a tragedy\nexcept all my personnel papers were in there. So I got some temporary papers, went\nback to Austria and of course I forgot to tell them that I had re-enlisted. So I guess\nI\u2019m a fugitive from \u2014 from \u2014 from military justice. And got back to \u2014 to Austria,\nstayed there until \u2014 in the meantime I \u2014 I traveled to both Dachau and to\nNuremberg.",
        "Q: This is traveled on your own? Was this your first time back in Germany?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh no, oh no, I had \u2014 my first time back in Germany was in \u2014 when I was still in\n\u2014I guess probably when I was in Verona, so it must have been about August. I\ntraveled to Germany, and | traveled to Switzerland in uniform. At that point you\ncould go to Switzerland. And \u2014",
        "Q: You \u2014 you had mentioned that earlier, so if you can expand a little bit about\ncoming into Germany wearing an American army uniform.",
        "A: Yeah, I sort of strutted around. I went back to Germany, to my old haunts, met a\nfew people who knew me. Noticed that there were a lot of people behind curtains\nlooking at this weird American walking in the street. Keep in mind you\u2019re in the fr \u2014\nI\u2019m \u2014 I was in the French zone, I did not look like a French soldier. Wandered\naround, went to Breisach where my parents had lived and were born, and went to\nFreiburg. Met \u2014 as I say, met some people. And then \u2014",
        "Q: Do any of them \u2014 any of the Germans whom you knew \u2014 who knew you before\nsay anything to you, especially?",
        "A: Oh yeah \u2014 well, you mean, before?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, especially in Breisach and in \u2014 in \u2014 in Loerrach, oh yes. These\nwere people who knew me.",
        "Q: Were they welcoming to you?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh yeah, those people were. The others stayed out of \u2014 I assume stayed out of the\nway because I didn\u2019t run into any of the others. The one person I looked for, I\ncouldn\u2019t find.",
        "Q: Did you feel like you belonged in these places?",
        "A: Oh heavens no, I wa \u2014 I felt like a conquering hero. No, I felt anything but.",
        "Q: Did you feel very \u2014 very American?",
        "A: Yes, very much so. About 150 percent. Yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s pretty heady for a 20 year\nold, you know, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 when a want \u2014 when you sort of run at age 15 and come\nback as \u2014 as a member of \u2014 of \u2014 of a victorious army, oh yeah, it feels very good.",
        "Q: Did you go about it \u2014 back to Dachau because of your father\u2019s experience?",
        "A: No, I went to \u2014 because the set of trials were coming up there. And I went there\nand then I decided I would rather go to Nuremberg.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, it seemed like the more interesting, more \u2014 historically more interesting sort\nof thing to do.",
        "Q: Was it painful for you to be at Dachau when \u2014 knowing your father had been\nthere?",
        "A: Yes, well, painful n \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know whether you would call it painful, it was\n\u2014 it was emotionally wrenching, but not \u2014 you know. But anyhow, I went back to my\nunit, arranged to get my army discharge in Vienna, and off I went to Nuremberg.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: So you went as a civilian to Nuremberg, oh.",
        "A: Yep. I left the army in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Vienna and \u2014 in May of 1946, moved to\nNuremberg as a civilian.",
        "Q: And what happened when you got there?",
        "A: Well, you know, you were assigned billets, you were \u2014 they had previously gi \u2014\ntested me, they had decided that I probably wouldn\u2019t make a terribly good \u2014 which I\nagreed with \u2014 a terribly good court interpreter, or an interpreter in the court, but they\ndid decide to use me as an interpreter where you had consecutive interpretation, and I\nbasically spent all my time either as a translator, which means on written documents,\nor as an interpreter working \u2014 well, here I should digress. The Nuremberg Trials\nactually had 22 main defendants, but in addition to that, it had seven organizations\nwhich were on trial. Things like the SA, the SS, the general staff, the Reich\u2019s\ncabinet. The idea being that if the members of the organization, if the organization\nwere declared as guilty of war crimes, then members above a certain level, or maybe\nat any level, would automatically be considered as \u2014 as guilty. And now, since\nhowever there were too many people that either wanted to testify, or provide\naffidavits, or statements in connection with these things, separate hearings were held,\nin a separate room, before a public, but they were done in German and English. And\nso you had, there you had, before a commissioner, the chief commissioner was an\nEnglishman who later on met an untimely death as being a \u2014 he was a secretary for\nNovember 18, 1997\nnorthern Ireland in the British cabinet, and his car bl \u2014 got blown up. And so you\nhad th-the \u2014 you had four, actually four commissioners; you had an American, you\nhad a Britisher, you had a Frenchman and you had a Russian. But all the discussions,\nall the ti \u2014 the \u2014 the testimony was in English and German, and instead of having\nimmediate translation, simultaneous translation, you had consecutive. But you had\nonly one interpreter, so you \u2014 you had one person doing English to German, ger \u2014\nand German English.",
        "Q: Wa - were these additional trials called the subsequent proceedings, or that was\nsomething else?",
        "A: No, this was part of the first, main trial, where you for instance had \u2014 and you had\nactually then, decisions of guilt and innocence of these various organizations, like the\nGerman general staff, and by virtue of sort of concentrating, these were the people\nthat were on \u2014 were being heard at that point. I spent much of my time working with\nwitnesses for the German general staff. People like von Rundstedt, Kesselring,\nManstein, etcetera. And \u2014",
        "Q: So what kind of contact did you have, or was this strictly during the hearings?",
        "A: No, this was one of the nice things in this, because A, the interpreter sat right next\nto the witness. These were not defendants, the main defendants never came. These\nwere people that testified. Some of them were subject later on to subsequent trials.\nAnd others then were, for instance, [indecipherable] Dieter Wisliceny, who was \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas what\u2019s his name\u2019s deputy. Heydrich. No, not Heydrich, Eichmann\u2019s deputy\nwas one of the people that testified, and he later on was sent off to Poland, where he\nwas executed. One of the nice things was that the interpreter sat right next to the\nwitness, you weren\u2019t separated by a glass wall. There was no microphone or\nanything like this, and you had \u2014 could have conversations with him during the\nbreak. In addition to that, your work as a \u2014 an interpreter usually, maximally you\ncould do this for \u2014 it was for about an hour and a half. It was fairly strenuous. And\nyou would sit \u2014 either you\u2019d sit in the room itself, in the courtroom, or you would sit\nin a waiting room, and that\u2019s where, usually, the next witness was waiting with a\nguard. And so you could sit there and talk and \u2014 yeah, had some interesting\nconversations. I had \u2014 Kesselring once asked me, Field Marshall Kesselring, he and\nI, we \u2014 we sat there waiting to go \u2014 go onstage, and he wanted to know where I \u2014\nwell, first \u2014 first we \u2014 where I'd been, and I\u2019d been, of course, in Italy, and he had\nbeen in Italy. Now, slightly different positions obviously, but we discussed military\nstrategy in Italy to the extent that I was able to. He then wanted to know where I\u2019d\nlearned my German, and I told him. And his reaction was, well, that must be a great\nsatisfaction for you to be here. And I said, it certainly is, Field Marshall. So, you\nknow, some of these \u2014 Rundstedt once talked \u2014 gave his testimony, and he talked\nfor \u2014 we had \u2014 we had told him, look, I can take about four minutes, five minutes\nmaximum, but after that I can\u2019t do any more. And so he made a 10 minute speech,\nNovember 18, 1997\nand then turned to me, and I sort of shrugged my shoulders. And I turned to the\njudge, who in turn said, well, we can have the court reporter read it off, and then\nwe'll translate it from that. The court reporter said, I couldn\u2019t follow him either, I\nwas hoping the interpreter could. So we all turned back to Field Marshall Rundstedt,\nwho then said \u2014 gave the exact same speech, broken into two parts. It was amazing.\nThis man \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say it was rehearsed, but he gave exactly the\nsame thing all over again. So anyhow, so it was \u2014 there were some interesting\nexperiences, the \u2014 the last head of the SA gave testimony about Crystal Night. And\nactually, I prefer to call 1t pogrom of 1938. And he was telling how the SA really was\na, more or less a social organization whose main task was to protect Jewish lives and\nproperty during \u2014 during this period, during Crystal Night.",
        "Q: And his name?",
        "A: Miller. Good German name. And he was \u2014 was going on, and then came the\nbreak and then this man really was hiding behind the door when brains were handed\nout, because he turned to me, and he says, you speak excellent German. I say, thank\nyou. And you have to be \u2014 you have to try to be neutral. I mean, you can\u2019t, obviously\nyour \u2014 your \u2014 your job is to translate. Well, you speak excellent German, thank you.\nWhere did you learn it? Or when did you learn it. So I told him when. Where did you\nlearn it? I says well, you know, I sort of learned it. Where did you learn it? I said, in\nGermany. When did you learn it? At that point I couldn\u2019t take it any longer, I said,\nNovember 18, 1997\nup til 1939. Which of course was after the period \u2014 and he finally, I think the lights\nfinally went on. This man had no idea. He had no idea what I \u2014 who I was, or what I\nwas doing, or where I had learned my German or anything like that. He just probed\nuntil I really couldn\u2019t evade the answer any more. But anyhow, so the \u2014",
        "Q: This man\u2019s name?",
        "A: His name was Miller, he was \u2014 no, no, wait a minute now \u2014",
        "Q: No \u2014 was it not Max Jiittner?",
        "A: No, not ma \u2014 who? Juttner? Yeah, well, it-it-it may well \u2014 in fact, a-as \u2014 I\u2019m\nchecking with my book. It must have been Max Juttner. He was \u2014 he was the \u2014 the\nformer head of the SA was Lutze, who died in 1943 in an automobile crash probably\ncaused by a strafing attack, and he sort of followed it.",
        "Q: How \u2014 you said you had to be neutral, that was part of your directions. How could\nyou be neutral after what you had been through?",
        "A: Well, your job was to translate, 1t was not to make, at that point not to make\njudgment. And you had to \u2014",
        "Q: H-How did you keep your distance then?",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you concentrated on \u2014 on \u2014 on translating and translating correctly,\nand that was difficult enough without making either sneers, sarcastic comments, or\nfaces, or anything like that. You \u2014 you had to, I mean, there\u2019s a certain\nprofessionalism involved an-and I don\u2019t think you \u2014 well, I didn\u2019t find that terribly\nNovember 18, 1997\ndifficult. I mean, I may \u2014 might have had my own thoughts about it, but that was\nabout the only time that I ever would reveal this to somebody who didn\u2019t ask me.\nAnd even he did, actually, in a way he did too, but \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you ever feel that you just had to release your anger at these\npeople?",
        "A: No. Privately, to my \u2014 within me, yes, but certainly not that ti \u2014 no. But then \u2014 but\nthen, you know, at that point, they looked \u2014 they looked \u2014 how should I say, I \u2014 an\nexample was in 1940 \u2014 end of 1946, I went to Paris to see \u2014 to I\u2014 I \u2014 at that point I\nwas already working on the subsequent trial \u2014 let me just digress a minute \u2014 and I\nwent to see \u2014 went to Cherche-Midi prison, the French prison, which a number of\nGerman war criminals were being held, or potential. And I had to get a deposition\nfrom two people. One was General Stiilpnagel, who was the commander in Paris\nfrom 1940 to 1942. He \u2014 there were two Stulpnagel gen-generals, Sttilpnagel; one\nof them was involved in the \u2014 the attack on Hitler, this was not the one. And I think\nthe French eventually probably even let him go. The other was hama \u2014 Helmut\nKnochen, head of the SD, who was Klaus Barbie\u2019s boss; probably one of the most\nhated men in France; the man who implemented the Night and Fog decree, etcetera.\nNow I saw Helmut Knochen before that, in Nuremberg, and in Nuremberg it was\nvery interesting because in Nuremberg the French prosecutor had a number of\nquestions to ask him. And he would ask Knochen and Knochen, who, by the way,\nNovember 18, 1997\nhad it \u2014 a PhD in linguistics, would deny that he ever heard of this, and the French\nprosecutor, man by the name of Monterey(ph) would pick up a piece of paper and\nsay well, is this your signature or not, and the man would say yes. And he\u2019d ask him\nanother question, Knochen would deny it, Monterey(ph) would hand him a\ndocument, says, is this your pre \u2014 piece the \u2014 is this your signature? Yes. Well, after\nthat it was almost like Pavlov\u2019s dog, because all that Monterey(ph) had to do 1s pick\nup a piece of paper and Knochen would admit everything. Well, when I got to Paris,\nhere was, in Cherche-Midi prison \u2014 Cherche-Midi Prison looks something like a \u2014\nwe sort of imagined French prisons to look in the 18\" century. You \u2014 when you\nknocked on the gate, somebody would come with a key about a foot long, and there\nwasn\u2019t very much oil in the lock, and they would open it, and then you\u2019d walk in,\nand then there\u2019s a room full of French prison guards and one of \u2014 couple of them\nwere getting haircuts, in another part they were \u2014 some were playing cards. And so\nyou finally get to this guy, you get to the prosecutor\u2019s office, and they would bring in\nHelmut Knochen. This was in 1946. Well, they\u2019d given helm \u2014 it was cold, it was\nDecember. Helmut \u2014 they had given Helmut Knochen \u2014 they must have given him\none shaving \u2014 one razor blade a month there, because he had a stubble beard. He had\na French army overcoat that was about four sizes too big. He looked pretty sad at that\nstage of the game, let me put it this way. He did not look like the sort of Aryan\nNovember 18, 1997\nsuperman, you know. So now many of the \u2014 you \u2014 you could \u2014 you could \u2014 you had\nto maintain your distance.",
        "Q: Did you have to do a lot of research to do this kind of translating?",
        "A: Only on German military trans \u2014 when I did the general staff on \u2014 on things like\nmilitary matters. And there was a certain amount of it, and of course, the German\nlanguage being what it is, where you can take any two words and make a third word\nout of it, you were very often \u2014 and in my case it was a lot easier than in the main\ncourtroom, where they didn\u2019t have time to think, but, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 when \u2014\nwhen a group like the SA, the Stormtroopers were up, and a word like wehrsport\ncomes in, wehr means defense, army, military. Sport means sport, it\u2019s things like\nhand grenade throwing, and forced marches with packs. These were \u2014 these were like\nthe \u2014 the military pentathlon in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the Olympics, these were semi \u2014 quasi\nmilitary activities now. And then you were forced to make a translation of that into\nEnglish, and the translation 1s extremely important. I mean, you translate as military\nsports, and they don\u2019t like it, because \u2014 but that\u2019s what you come up with. But there\nis no such word in the English language. So, you know, you try to prepare for it, but\nyou never could for everything. I mean, you would \u2014 you would be blindsided every\nnow and then by some phrase.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Did you have any contact besides the \u2014 wi-with these witnesses or defendants,\nbesides the \u2014 the \u2014 the two incidents that you talked about? Did you have any other\nout \u2014 outside contact with them?",
        "A: Outside, or inside? I mean \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, when they weren\u2019t testifying.",
        "A: When they were not? No. No. No, the-th-they were \u2014 they were locked up when \u2014\nand I had no dealings in the prison itself. We did have one interesting case, and that\nwas when one man came up and that\u2019s where I get s \u2014 blindsided by the prosecutor\nwho didn\u2019t warn me in advance, because they asked him, do you know anything\nabout the Gleiwitz radio station attack? Well, Gleiwitz \u2014 Gleiwitz radio station was\na German radio station on \u2014 right on the Polish border, and just before the war broke\nout between Germany and Poland, there was an attack on this German radio station\nby Poles and Hitler gave it as one of the main reasons for attacking Poland. And the\nwitness, who was a member of the SD, German counterintelligence, said yes, I know\nsomething about it. Says, what do you know about it? Says, I was in charge. Well, no\n\u2014 there are times when you wish that the prosecutors would let you know something\nlike that. They knew what was coming up, I had no idea. I knew from history what\nthe Gleiwitz radio station attack was, but you know, this was the first indication I\never got that 1t was \u2014 1t \u2014 it was a German a \u2014 attack. I mean, you suspected it, but\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou never suspected to meet the man that was in charge of it. So, there \u2014 those times\nit\u2019s difficult to keep a straight face, but you try, you do your best.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear any testimony regarding Jews and actions against Jews?",
        "A: Oh yeah, certainly with Dieter \u2014 Dieter Wisliceny, as I say, who was\nEichmann\u2019s deputy. There were a number of them, but D-Dieter Wisliceny was the\n\u2014 the \u2014 was the \u2014 the most important one.",
        "Q: But then, what did he talk about?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What were some of the things he talked about?",
        "A: Ah, there I have to go back to my notes. But they were talking about that the \u2014 the\n\u2014 the Wannsee Conference, of course, the protocol \u2014 I\u2019m not sure whether the\nprotocol at Wannsee Conference had been found by that time, or had been located\nby that time. But he talked about that. At that point, Wisliceny knew exactly what\nwas going on, the court knew that he knew, and so on.",
        "Q: And again, were you able to just keep your emotional level down when you\nwould hear testimony about Jews?",
        "A: Yeah, you did. You have to. I mean, there\u2019s a certain professionalism involved,\nyou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re there for \u2014 to do a job and it\u2019s up to the court to make the decision,\nand regardless of how you feel, you have to maintain your \u2014 oh, how should I say,\nequilibrium. You have to be straight and translate it just as it was, you know.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Is your translation then, a part of the official records, part of the official\ntestimony?",
        "A: Some of it 1s, some of it is what was retained. The \u2014 the \u2014 there wa \u2014 it was a\nrecord made, of course, at that point, of the \u2014 four commissioners then made a\nrecommendation to the main court, and some of those witnesses that we heard, were\nthen heard in open court as well. Yeah. No, it is, but many more da \u2014 many more\nthings \u2014 things that I did subsequently, the next \u2014 working on the subsequent trial\nwhere I abstracted documents for future trials, and I still run across those in my\nresearch every now and then.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you were working on the documents, and writing the abstract?",
        "A: Well, this was after I left \u2014 I left Nuremberg on the day \u2014 on the main date \u2014 the\nmain defendants in the main trial were executed, and went to Berlin and then worked\nthere as a junior research assistant in Berlin, in the Berlin document center, working\non subsequent trials, on prep-preparing subsequent trials. And there, of course, you\ntried to identify mater \u2014 at that point your job changed, you were no longer neutral,\nyou were trying to help the prosecution to the maximum extent possible. And you\nidentified documents, and wrote abstracts.",
        "Q: How \u2014 how did \u2014 what were your thoughts when these wit \u2014 when these\ndefendants were executed?",

        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t say of celebration, no. No, it was, well, fine.

He didn\u2019t really\nbelong, and he\u2019s the only person I hadn't really \u2014 couldn\u2019t identify immediately as to\nwho they were or what they were and so on.",
        "Q: What was it like to, again, live in Germany? You were living in Nuremberg,\nwhat was that like?",
        "A: Oh no, I was living in the \u2014 in an American or in \u2014 1n a foreign co-cocoon there. It\nwas not living in Germany, I mean \u2014 it was delightful, I mean, the thing I went back\n\u2014 we \u2014 you know, when, for instance, I went to Freiburg or Nuremberg, you know,\nyou stood on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 an apple crate, and you could look over most of\nthe town, and you didn\u2019t \u2014 you felt this \u2014 this is just the way it ought to be.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the destr \u2014 destruction?",
        "A: Yeah. But, no, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t live on the \u2014 I mean, you \u2014 y-you mixed\nobviously more than many other people. I remember while being in the army in\nAustria I went to \u2014 I was in Vienna one time, and there was a show in one of the\nNovember 18, 1997\nparks, and there was a \u2014 especially one of the things, one of the \u2014 the acts was a\ncomedian who was telling jokes about the war, and half the audience was watching\nthe stage, and the other half was watching me. Well, I was in an American uniform,\nwhat was he do \u2014 this was in Germany, you know. So you did \u2014 you did have a\ncertain amount of contact with local population, but it was on a totally different level,\nI mean you \u2014 you did not feel you\u2019re home. There was no \u2014 no such feeling\nwhatsoever.",
        "Q: So then you said you went to Berlin, to the documentation center?",
        "A: Then I \u2014 then I went to Berlin to the documentation center, and I started \u2014 we\nstarted working, I remember, on the subsequent trial. And the first one I think I\nstarted working on was the justice ministry trial. And after working on about three\nmonths from the Ministry of Justice, we discovered that he had committed suicide\ntwo months earlier, but they had forgotten to tell us. So that was a waste of time. But\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nNovember 18, 1997\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab. This is tape number three, side\nA, and you had said that you had arrived in Berlin, to the documentation center.",
        "A: Yes, and \u2014",
        "Q: Th-This is October 1946.",
        "A: October 1946, and for the next number of months, about six months, I was\nlooking at documentation, at documents, abstracting things for the use in some of the\nsubsequent trials. This is where I came across, personally came across some of the\ndevastating materials. I mean, there\u2019s the \u2014 the register, I remember distinctly the\nregister from a \u2014 one of the \u2014 the German quote, hospitals, unquote, which were \u2014\nwere the mentally deficient or mentally ill people were killed, and I remember seeing\nthe death register. This was in the case of the \u2014 I think it was the justice trial, where\nthe head \u2014 at the top of the page 1t would list the name, and it would list the time of\ndeath, and then it would list the place of death, and the cause of death. And then\nunder that you had a list of maybe 30 - 40 names, however long the register was, and\nditto marks under everything else. So everybody died at the same time, of the same\nheart failure.",
        "Q: Was this Hadamar\u2019? Am I pronouncing it right? H-a-d-a-m-a-r building \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t re \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "Q: Hospital.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember which \u2014 which institution there was, but it was one of those\nthings that, you know, they \u2014 they had to fill out a death register, and this was the\nway to do it. I mean, Germans were very precise and practical. Law requirement was\nto have a registry. And they had one, but they didn\u2019t want to spend all that much\ntrouble, to invent a new cause of death for each case, so they make ditto marks. They\ngave the name and then a ditto mark under it. This is where, as I say, so many of the\n\u2014 some devastating materials of that type were found. Orders which were signed by\nofficials. One of the nice things the Germans did as far as the prosecution was\nconcerned, was that every leading official had his own \u2014 had \u2014 had an initial. Well,\nthose are very frequently difficult to decipher. But what was nice, they all used\ndifferent colors. So if you saw a blue initial, let\u2019s say, in the \u2014 in the Ministry of\nJustice, you know exactly who saw it, and if you saw a red one, you know who saw\nit. So it wasn\u2019t just you \u2014 you could identify the individual, and we\u2019re talking here at\nthe top level obviously, at the sub-muinistry level, and the sub-minister level. And this\nis where, in going through the Ministry of Justice files, I had an interesting\nexperience, because having lived through Kristallnacht, I decided this was a good\ntime to look at some of the files having to do with Crystal Night. And the document\ncenter had a lot of German employees, who we would indicate from registers what\ndocuments we wanted, or what folders we \u2014 what folders we wanted, and they would\nNovember 18, 1997\nbring it. And one day this gentleman brought me some files, I started getting some\nfiles having to do with \u2014 with Herschel Grynszpan and the \u2014 the Crystal Night\nevents and afterwards. And he said to me, I see you\u2019re interested in the events in\nParis in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was. And at that point I had in front of me a\n\u2014 the future \u2014 the trial schedule. The Germans had planned to put on trial Herschel\nGrynszpan after he had been turned over to the German authorities in 1941, after the\nfall of France. And two of the witnesses were going to be members of the germ \u2014 the\nembassy staff in Paris, namely \u2014 I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at\nthe front gate when he came in, when Grynszpan came in to \u2014 and the other was the\nclerk at the information desk who, in fact, took Herschel Grynszpan to see vom\nRath, the German third secretary who then \u2014 and he subsequently went and shot him.\nAnd this, of course triggered, or was used as an excuse for the events of Crystal\nNight. And I \u2014 the trial preparation called for these two clerks to testify. I asked them\nwhether he knew Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph), clerk so and so, and he says yes, I knew him\nquite well. I said, well, what about Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph) or clerk Nagorka? He was\nthe man who \u2014 to whom Herschel Grynszpan said whom he wanted to see. This\nwas a fairly important bit of evidence because of some of the \u2014 th-the arguments\nbeing made whether or not vom Rath was the actual intended victim, or the\naccidental victim. And the clerk said well nag \u2014 clerk Nagorka, that\u2019s me. So that\nwas a rather startling bit of information, but anyhow, he provided me the information\nNovember 18, 1997\nthat I wanted. And this was a \u2014 basically the beginning of the \u2014 the beginning of my\nresearch for a book which I finally finished about 40 years later.",
        "Q: Well, I guess we can talk later about what kind of information he gave to you.\nWell, what did he tell you at that point?",
        "A: Well, he confirmed \u2014 well, let \u2014 let me go back. The question was, did \u2014 at that\npoint Grynszpan was asking \u2014 this was in 1942, after he had turned over to the\nGermans of \u201941, he claimed that he shot vom Rath for personal reasons. And so the\nquestion was, the key question was, did Herschel Grynszpan ask for vom Rath in\nperson, or did he just ask for a German clerk \u2014 a German officer. And the answer,\naccording to Nagorka was, he asked to see an embassy official. And this was a key\nbit of evidence.",
        "Q: We'll talk some more about that later. What else did you do at the documentation\ncenter?",
        "A: Well, we spend all the time going through documents, every now and then finding\nsomething of interest, identifying, writing abstracts, and sending them on to \u2014 to\nNuremberg. The \u2014 some of them were \u2014 at that point in Nuremberg, the medical\ntrial was going on, but subsequ \u2014 they were looking for materials for subsequent\ntrials, the Ministry of Justice, and various other ministries. And you just sort of \u2014\neither you were told, or you were given advice where to look, or you sort of followed\na hunch, or you followed something, so \u2014 something followed a trail which suddenly\nNovember 18, 1997\nopened up. By far and away the mo \u2014 well, almost the most interesting or\ncomprehensive trail led to the Reich\u2019s Chancellery, Hitler\u2019s office. Because every\ntime one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight,\nthey would send an \u2014 a copy to Hitler\u2019s Secretary of the Chancellery. So there you\nwould have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back. I mean,\nwhen a peop \u2014 person like the Minister of Post got mad \u2014 or the Minister of\nAgriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him \u2014 accused him of\nhaving an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the\nMinistry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty\nletter, and also send a copy to the chancellery. So that \u2014 there was a lot of\ninformation obtainable there. But mainly, you would stumble across something. Or,\nthey would \u2014 somebody would identify a certain event, and he \u2014 you would dig into\nit.",
        "Q: How did you get that kind of training, to do this kind of research?",
        "A: [have got no training whatsoever. Let\u2019s face it, I mean, the U.S. government\u2019s\njust terribly short of people. So you \u2014 you got into it. You \u2014 you had a more than\nrudimentary knowledge of the German government by that time, and you just sort of\n\u2014 there was no training for this sort of thing. I mean, you couldn\u2019t afford to have\nsomebody sit there and translate this stuff to \u2014 for somebody else to analyze it. I\nmean, some of it \u2014 obviously the \u2014 some of the people at Nuremberg, some of the\nNovember 18, 1997\nprosecutors spoke no German. So you translated relevant documents for them. But\nyou know \u2014",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t translate everything you read?",
        "A: Oh heavens, no. You only trans \u2014 you made a judgment and you translated what\nwas import \u2014 what you thought was important. But you know, as they say, in the land\nof blind.",
        "Q: So that was a big responsibility you had going through that kind of information,\nand trying to decide what was relevant.",
        "A: Yes. I mean, sometimes you would \u2014 you had this supervisor whom you could\nask. We had a \u2014 a former German, who is now a professor of political science at\nsome college in the east coast, and he was our supervisor. So you could go to him,\nand \u2014 and say well, what do you think of this?",
        "Q: How big a group of \u2014 of translators or \u2014 or researchers were doing this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how many people were doing that. I mean, we \u2014 we were a group, I\nwould say that I immediately worked with about 10 people.",
        "Q: What other areas were you doing research in?",
        "A: Well, as I say, it \u2014 1t \u2014 whatever the trials, whatever subsequent trials, I mainly \u2014\nwe mainly did the Ministry of Justice, where, as I say, we found out after three\nmonths that two months earlier, our main defendant had committed suicide. But then\nNovember 18, 1997\nhis deputy was still alive. Then you had the \u2014 you had the ... I don\u2019t remember. I\ndon\u2019t remember who.",
        "Q: Okay. When you were in Nuremberg, did you see any of the well-known names,\nlike Goering, or \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, of course, they were sitting in the courtroom, sure. Well, every time you\nwent \u2014 I mean, they didn\u2019t have much of a choice, they were all there. You had \u2014 you\nhad \u2014 you saw them, obviously, on the dock. The only people I really got to know\noutside was Hoffmann, who was Hitler\u2019s personal photographer, whose daughter\nhad married Baldur von Schirach, the head of the Hitler youth, who was on the\ndock. And she often \u2014 so she was with her father often, and I had the opportunity, I\nhad permission a \u2014 permission to carry a camera 1n the courthouse. And so I would\noften talk to him.",
        "Q: Is this a personal camera, or for \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Yes, personal camera. Came up, had qui \u2014 made quite a few photographs.",
        "Q: Do you still have those photographs?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Do these people look bigger than life, or less larger than life?",
        "A: Well, you saw them in the context that they were \u2014 were there. I would say for the\nmost part they were certainly not big in life any more. I mean, you knew that they\nwere prisoners, you know they were on trial for their life. I would say the only one\nNovember 18, 1997\nwho \u2014 whom you might \u2014 not larger than life, but \u2014 was Goering, who \u2014 whose\npresence was \u2014 was \u2014 he wa \u2014 he was an imposing presence, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "Q: What was your reaction when you, let\u2019s say, heard he committed suicide? Were\nyou angry, or \u2014",
        "A: Too bad. I felt \u2014",
        "Q: Too bad what?",
        "A: \u2014 that he cheated the \u2014 the hangman. No, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it was not anything \u2014 it\nwas \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I sort of felt sorry for the prison staff, who \u2014 obviously somebody\u2019s \u2014\nsomebody was going to be blamed for it. No, not \u2014 no \u2014 I mean, how he went really\nwasn\u2019t all that important to me.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s jump back to Berlin. Oh no, you had also said that you had seen \u2014 you\nhad said that you had seen von Schirach when you were younger, and then a second\ntime in the dock. Did he look any different?",
        "A: Well, he was a lot closer the second time, because the first time, obviously he had\nno \u2014 I mean, I wasn\u2019t looking for trouble. I just saw him out of the \u2014 out \u2014 looking\nout of the apartment. And he was down at that \u2014 must have been about 1937 - \u201938. At\nthat time he was head \u2014 head of the Hitler youth. He subsequently then became\nGauleiter of Vienna, and so on, and it was in that capacity that he ended up in \u2014 in\nNuremberg and got 20 years. He was a lot closer then.",
        "Q: So how long did you stay in Berlin?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I stayed in Berlin until about March, I guess, March or April 1947, and then\ndecided it was go \u2014 time to go back, to quit.",
        "Q: What made you decide that?",
        "A: Well, I decided I couldn\u2019t quite go on having only two years of high school, it\nwas time to go back to school. And of course, I came back about the time a great\nmany G.I.s came back, or were back, and had decided with the \u2014 thanks to the G.I.\nbill. And so there was a great deal of competition for places in school, and American\ncolleges, which of course the attendance exploded as a result of that. But I\u2014 so I \u2014 as\nI say, ninetee \u2014 early 1947, I figured I better go back, finish high school. Well, do\nsomething. And \u2014",
        "Q: You had not had a high school degree?",
        "A: No, I had two years of high school, that was it. And then I applied to a couple of\nplaces, and I remember I applied to Rutgers University, and \u2014 but the one that I\napplied, that I finally went to, was the school which would admit me without\nfinishing high school; they didn\u2019t care, and that was the University of Chicago. So in\nfall of 1947, thanks to the G.I. bill, because without it I certainly would \u2014 oh, I\u2019m\ncertainly would have gone to Rutgers, which was out of state college or university; I\nwas off to Chicago. And spent three years there.",
        "Q: And what did you study?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, in Chicago, the old days of Robert Maynard Hutchins, you didn\u2019t \u2014 they\ntold you what you were going to study, you didn\u2019t tell them. It wa \u2014 it was an\ninteresting situation. They \u2014 you took 28 ou \u2014 battery of 28 hours of tests, and then\nthey said here are the courses you have to take, and when you finish these courses\nsatisfactory, you get a B.A. degree. And I did, and in 1949, I got my B.A. Obviously\nI picked up something in between. Then spent a year taking \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, I spent\none semester, after finishing the college of the University of Chicago, I spent one\nsemester in the School of Social Service Administration, and decided that that was\nnot the appropriate career for me. I had nothing against the School of Social Service\nAdministration, I just couldn\u2019t quite see myself working with some of the people that\nwere taking courses with me, and then switched back to political science, until the\nend of 1949 \u2014 \u00b047? No, no, 1950. And in 1950 then decided to go to Stanford\nUniversity in order to \u2014 I wanted to \u2014 to do some research on the Grynszpan case\nand the Hoover Library of War and Peace had the best materials. So I went out there,\nand then spent a year there gradu \u2014",
        "Q: Do-Doing research on that?",
        "A: No, no, no, I was \u2014 well, I got a second B.A. there. Stanford University looked at\nmy \u2014 the fact that it took me two years in Chicago to get a B.A., they were horrified\nenough that I didn\u2019t finish high school. But the fact that I only spent two years\nNovember 18, 1997\ngetting my B.A., and to Stanford, in order \u2014 the way to get your B.A. is to be in\nschool for four years. So I got my second B.A. there, in political science.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: Well, then something happened which \u2014 you know, you hear these stories only in\nAmerica, something that I still consider amazing, and which I tell some of my f\u2014\nmy \u2014 especially my European acquaintances about. The State Department put out a\ncall to all the colleges and universities for a special intern program. Every school in\nthe country was invited to provi \u2014 to designate somebody for an intern program \u2014 or\nnominate somebody. And eventually, in early \u2014 you'll have to pass something called\na JMA, which was a \u2014 this was during the time of the Korean War, there was a\nfreeze on federal hiring, except if you passed this exam. And you \u2014 the prerequisite\nwas passing the JMA. Well, to make a long story short, out of the 22 people picked\nby the State Department, I was one of them, from Stanford. And I still find this\namazing, because there was certainly no need for this \u2014 the government agency at\nthat point to pick somebody who\u2019d been in the country only 10 years. It was ju \u2014I\njust found it ab-absolutely amazing, because it was a special program. And so we\ncame together, there were 22 of us from all over the United States. And that\u2019s how I\nthen entered my first job, State Department.",
        "Q: And your career after that?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh well, let\u2019s see. After that I joined the Foreign Service. I joined the State\nDepartment in 1951, joined the Foreign Service in 1955 \u2014 four \u2014 54 \u2014 no, *55. 1955\nto 1957, I was assistant cultural officer in Vienna, then back to Washington for two\nyears, 1960 to \u201962. The ama \u2014 new American embassy at Lom\u00e9 Togo. Lom\u00e9 at that\npoint was so new that most of our mail went to Lima, because nobody in the State\nDepartment mailroom really had heard of Lom\u00e9. Then from Lom\u00e9 back to\nWashington for two years. Then to eastern Nigeria for two years, which at that\npoint was on the verge of becoming Biafra, just before the civil war. From there a\nyear to Sierra Leone. You ca \u2014 as you can see, I \u2014 I hit all the beauty sp \u2014 actually\nwe di \u2014 we liked \u2014 we very much liked all of Africa, with the exception of sieral \u2014\nSierra Leone. I guess we got a little satiated at that point. From there, three years to\nTunisia. From Tunisia then a year and a half, almost two years to Bangkok,\nThailand. Now, there was quite a switch. From Bangkok, Thailand onto a year at\nCornell University for a sabbatical, where \u2014 I guess you call it a sabbatical. Then\nback to Washington from 1973 to 1976. And at that point I was sent to \u2014 I was\ndetailed by the State Department to an organization in which the United States at\nthat point was not even a member, namely the International Labor Organization in\nGeneva, Switzerland. We went there for one year and stayed 10, and retired in\n1986.",
        "Q: And when did you get married?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Woop. Well, I got married while \u2014 in my last year in Chicago.",
        "Q: And is your wife also from Europe?",
        "A: Yes, she is from Berlin, and I met her through somebody with whom I\u2019m \u2014 I\nworked in Berlin.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit now about your book and your research on Grynszpan and\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 again what inspired you in \u2014 in the course of your research.",
        "A: Well, it was an interesting case. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t catcha \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 the book,\neventually I named, \u201cThe Day the Holocaust Began,\u201d because I do feel that the\nbeginning of the Holocaust, or \u2014 was with Crystal Night. It was used by the Nazis as\nan excuse. But it was the beginning, it was the first time, really, with a couple of\nminor exceptions of centralized \u2014 centrally directed anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish\nactivities in Germany. And while there were obviously earlier ones, like the boycott\nof nine \u2014 April 1933, the book burning of May 1, 1933, but after that it was really\nthese \u2014 most of the things that happened were locally inspired, or locally activated.\nThis, the events, once they got going, and even though Crystal Night was not\ncentrally directed in the normally accepted term of the word \u2014 the wor \u2014 yeah \u2014\nafterwards, it certainly was, and that was the beginning, to me, of the Holocaust. I \u2014 I\nfound this young man \u2014 the story, of course, is that somebody, his parents \u2014 a young\nPolish Jew, living in Germany, born in Germany. His parents had lived in\nGermany since 1911, walked into \u2014 heard \u2014 heard that his pare \u2014 he was living in\nNovember 18, 1997\nParis, heard that his parents had been shoved over the border into Poland. In \u2014 in\nlate October 1940 \u2014 no, \u201938, they sent him a postcard in Paris, where he was living\nillegally with his uncle. He walked into the German embassy, shot the third\nsecretary. The third secretary, after having what to the ra \u2014 to those of us in the\nforeign service can only call a meteoric rise, within two days he became first\nsecretary. But he died. And that was then the beginning of the events of November\nninth to 10\", the night of the ninth - 10 of November. He was held wi \u2014 in France.\nSubsequently he said he had killed vom Rath because of the postcard he had gotten\nfrom his parents, and so on. He then was subsequently turned over to the Germans.\nThey were going to make a major propaganda trial for \u2014 in which there were two\ndefendants, world jury and in an \u2014 in the form of Herschel Grynszpan, and they\nwere going to try to prove that the shot of Paris 1938 was the same as the shot of\nSarajevo some 20 years earlier, in other words, that they had caused World War II.\nThe Foreign Ministry was behind it, they hav \u2014 had to have some excuse, they were\ndesperately looking for an excuse for the outbreak of World War II.",
        "Q: So how did you do your research?",
        "A: Well, the research of course, I \u2014 I did a lot of it \u2014 I got a lot of it at \u2014 at \u2014 at\nStanford, materials. I got a lot of zer \u2014 not Xerox, Photostat copies of documents in\nBerlin. And then in th \u2014 read an awful lot and research, got a lot of materials; for\ninstance, as an example, the full Goebbels diary was at Stanford, or the \u2014 the\nNovember 18, 1997\nPhotostat of the entire microfilm was \u2014 was at Stanford. Worked there, and over\ntime, eventually actually, later on went to \u2014 met with his \u2014 with vom Rath\u2019s brother,\nwho was a lawyer in Wiesbaden, when we were living in Geneva. Did \u2014 found the\nFrenchman who had done a great deal of work on the same thing, and exchanged\ndocuments with him, and this was basically how it worked. I mean you \u2014 it\u2019s a never\nending thing. And actually I had my first chance to publish my work in 1952 or \u201953,\nwhen somebody in England heard about it, and I was offered that they would\npublish it, and in the State Department, being a very junior officer at that stage of the\ngame, I had to \u2014 at that time it was necessary to submit manuscripts to a review\ncommittee. And after talking to these people, they said send it over, I sent it over to\nthem. I had a document written. And about four weeks, five weeks later I get a call\nback saying this is a very interesting \u2014 we\u2019ve just made a couple of suggestions\nwhere we wouldn\u2019t \u2014 since you\u2019re now a member of the State Department, where it\nwould not be totally appropriate, but we\u2019ve marked the place. Well, the document\ncame back and it weighed about twice as much as it did before it went out because\nthey put paper clips on all those places. Well, they had a paper clip almost on every\nother page. And what had \u2014 had happened was that the French Foreign Minister,\nGeorges Bonnet, at that point was go \u2014 who had been the French Foreign Minister,\nhe was going to testify for the Germans, or at least so the documentation said, was\ngoing to testify in this big trial against Herschel Grynszpan. Well, by this point, mis\nNovember 18, 1997\n\u2014 Georges Bonnet had become \u2014 1950s \u2014 Georges Bonnet had become\n[indecipherable] to Franco-American Friendship Society, and it would just not do,\nsaying that he had collaborated with the Germans. And without it, the story wouldn\u2019t\nhave made quite as much sense. So I put it away and kept it \u2014 kept it packed up for\n35 years.",
        "Q: And then what prompted you to wer \u2014 t-to bring it out again?",
        "A: Well, when you \u2014 when you work and you \u2014 the people usually ask you what are\nyou going to do afterwards, you say you\u2019ll write a book. And then when finally it\ncomes you retire, you gotta put up or shut up.",
        "Q: Did you learn a tremendous amount by doing this research? Did you come to\nconclusions you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be coming to?",
        "A: Yes, very definitely did. The biggest conclusion \u2014 first of all yes, you obvi \u2014 I\nobviously did a great deal of research into the era, into the life of the Polish Jews in\nGermany. I mean, here\u2019s \u2014 here are \u2014 here are people that came to Germany in\n1911. In 1938 they\u2019re shoved across the border as Poles. You learn about why they\nwere pushed across the border, and here you can attribute that to the actions of the\nPolish government as much as to the German government. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s not too\nwell known, but the fact of the matter 1s, 1t was \u2014 1t was provoked by the Poles. But\nthe biggest thing that I think I learned is that to me Herschel Grynszpan to start\nwith, was an assassin. I don\u2019t like assassins, for any reason, regardless. And I was not\nNovember 18, 1997\nterribly favorably well disposed towards him. I learned two things. One, before his\nprobable death \u2014 in other words, we still don\u2019t know exactly where he died, although\nwe have a pretty good idea \u2014 this young man, from becoming a young, hot-headed\nassassin, became a true hero. Secondly, whatever damage he did an \u2014 to Jews, which\nresulted in Crystal Night, I think he saved many more lives, or his act saved many\nmore lives than the \u2014 the \u2014 the death that he caused; for the very simple reason that\nimmigration of Jews from Germany and Austria started high in 1933, went down\nthrough 1937, early \u00b038, and then immediately after Crystal Night, immigration shot\nup. So a lot more people left Germany as a result. So in the end, he really \u2014 his act\nreally saved lives, even though 110 - 115 people died in the immediate aftermath of\nCrystal Night.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab. This is tape number three, side\nB. The book, and the research on the Grynszpan case, and when you did your\nresearch, did you interview his lawyer, or did you interview other people, and \u2014 and\ndid you interview other people?\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I interviewed a number of people, I interviewed the psychiatrist, the German\npsychiatrist who examined him on behalf of the German government. In fact, I\nvisited him in a hospital in \u2014 in Berlin.",
        "Q: His \u2014 his name? Okay.",
        "A: [indecipherable] there.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I interviewed his lawyer \u2014",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you learn anything from the psychiatrist?",
        "A: No, I got his medical opinion, which was reinforced by the documentation we\nfound. He found \u2014 he found him a sla \u2014 somewhat o \u2014 more than average intelligent\nyoung man. Quite mature for his age, but at that point, of course, he had been in\nGerman hands for quite a while. I should say this, that he was treated very well by\nthe Germans, because he was a special prisoner, they wanted him for a big show\ntrial. He \u2014 and while in prison he was allowed to keep his hair. He usually worked in\n\u2014 worked in the kitchen on food distribution, which means that wherever he was\nimprisoned, he had enough to eat. He was not, as far as I can tell, mistreated. And\nwhen the trial finally opened, a decision finally was made to postpone the trial\nindefinitely. Hitler personally described him, or said that he was his personal charge.\nIn other words that nothing was to happen to this young man without Hitler\u2019s\npersonal decision. Now, it probably \u2014 whether it \u2014 whether it finally did happen,\nNovember 18, 1997\nhappened with Hitler\u2019s knowledge or not, a \u2014 chances are he died at the \u2014 towards\nthe very end of the war. He survived most of the war. But let\u2019s see, we interviewed \u2014\nor I interviewed vom Rath\u2019s brother, I interviewed Moro-Giafferi. Moro-Giafferi\nwas the French criminal lawyer who was hired by Dorothy Thompson and a\njournalist group to defend Herschel Grynszpan. And him I saw in Paris in 1946 \u2014\n40 \u2014 late \u2014 in December of 1946.",
        "Q: Did he give you any insights?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. He was, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he cracked the case in \u2014 as to what\nthe \u2014 the subsequent argument or this \u2014 the \u2014 what the \u2014 the argument that\nGrynszpan used to avoid a trial. Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan\navoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan\non the world stage, on trial \u2014 for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite\nthe main newspaper people from around th-the \u2014 the neutral Europe. They \u2014 it was a\nbig to-do \u2014 was to be a big propaganda trial. They had built a special courtroom\n[indecipherable] new telephone lines. It was to be a big to-do. And Herschel\nGrynszpan finally announced t \u2014 before \u2014 shortly before the trial was to take place,\nthat he had killed vom Rath because vom Rath had made homosexual advances to\nhim. Now, obviously homosexuality is not what major propaganda trials are made of,\nespecially if the victim was supposedly involved. Well, when I finally did speak to\nhersh \u2014 to Moro-Giafferi in Paris, he \u2014 by the way, he was a\u2014 a man about five foot\nNovember 18, 1997\ntall and five foot wide, who when I saw him the first time, greeted me with the\nstatement that he had ever \u2014 only ever lost one man to the guillotine, and that was\nBluebeard, and \u2014 which I said could be forgiven. And he was the number one\ncriminal lawyer in France in \u2014 in the 20\" century; certainly the first half of the fu \u2014\n20\" century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every \u2014 every major\ncriminal trial, especially murder trials. Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he\nsays, well, let me explain where he got that idea. He says, when I initially took up his\ndefense \u2014 and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point\nwas a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when\nforeign correspondents were still major figures, in \u2014 in the days when you didn\u2019t\nhave instantaneous CNN coverage and so on. He said, I told \u2014 I asked Herschel why\nhe had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what\nhappened to his parents. And I explained that this matter \u2014 Moro-Giafferi speaking\n\u2014 I explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards\npolitical crimes. However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much\nmore lenient. And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able\nto confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in town\nthat he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that\nthere was a homosexual connection between the two. Well, according to Moro-\nGiafferi, Grynszpan rejected this out of hand. But then a few years later\n100November 18, 1997\nremembered it, used it, and basically said to his cellmate, they\u2019re not going to make\nme \u2014 make another show trial out of me, they\u2019ve done enough damage already.",
        "Q: What did you \u2014 what did you want to accomplish by doing this research and\nwriting this book?",
        "A: Well, I just wanted to put it on paper, and put it in history. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that\nterribly important, because if that hadn't happened, something else would have\ntriggered what happened subsequently, where there would have been a\nKristallnacht, it probably would have happened differently. But I certainly don\u2019t\nthink that Herschel Grynszpan caused it; he was the excuse. And so I don\u2019t\nconsider this book as you know, that terribly important. It\u2019s \u2014 to me it\u2019s an\ninteresting footnote to history. I don\u2019t over \u2014 don\u2019t want to overdramatize the\nimportance of it. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting \u2014 it\u2019s a fascinating life, it\u2019s an interesting\nindividual, certainly the way he turned out to be. And as far he \u2014 he \u2014 I have the\nutmost respect for him, and I felt his story needed to be told.",

        "A: Until the next one comes out, yes.",
        "Q: Can we talk now about some general questions? Do you think you\u2019re a different\nperson today because of what you went through as a young \u2014 young boy?",
        "A: Oh heavens, yes.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?\n101November 18, 1997",
        "A: In every which way. I mean, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t help but be affected by\nthese events. I mean, if I had had a normal childhood, if I\u2019d had different\nacquaintances, yes, of course we\u2019re all \u2014 we\u2019re all changed a great deal. I\u2019ve no idea\nwhat we would have been like otherwise, but there\u2019s no question. We\u2019re more \u2014 I\nthink more introspective. We \u2014 we have a different view of life, more serious view of\nlife. No doubt about it.",
        "Q: You had said earlier that you lost part of your childhood. Do you think you ever\ngot it back?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think you can \u2014 there\u2019s no way that you can get it back. And you\nknow, it\u2019s gone, but nerit \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it affects you and it changes\nyou and \u2014 and then also, keep in mind it\u2019s not just what happens to you, it\u2019s also\nwhat happens to the people who \u2014 that you associate with. For instance, the people\nthat surround you. I mean, as an example, my wife lost both her parents at\nAuschwitz. Being associated with some \u2014 with these people, the more immediate\nvictims, undoubtedly affects you. On the other hand, at the same time, of course, you\nappreciate much more what you have. And I think that\u2019s of \u2014 that\u2019s a positive side of\nit, that you \u2014 you are much more appreciative. You realize what life can be like and\nwhat life is like now. So there are both negative and I guess, in a way, indirectly\ncertain positive aspects to it. But change, a change that, for all of us, are \u2014 are\nprofound.

        "Q: You went through a difficult time when you had to leave your parents and you\nwere in Switzerland, and you were by yourself with those two families. When your\nchildren became that same age, did that bring back that time to you? Is that a difficult\ntime?",
        "A: Yes, it \u2014 it \u2014 it certainly \u2014 it certainly affects you, you certainly think about it. I\nremember sitting, of all the \u2014 of all the places, it really hit me when I saw \u201cDer\nRing,\u201d Wagner\u2019s Ring, where Wotan leaves his daughter surrounded by a ring of\nfire. It really hit me right then and there. So yes, there are \u2014 there are many times,\nand you try to guard your children, of course, from that sort of thing. One of the\nthings I do when I do inscribe my book on the Holocaust, or, \u201cThe Day the\nHolocaust Began,\u201d I usually write, may our children never fully understand what is\nwritten in this \u2014 what is written here. So you try to protect them, but 1-1t undoubtedly\naffects your life, your attitude, your habits. The whole \u2014 your outlook on life, oh yes.",
        "Q: What kind of habits are affected?",
        "A: Well, I we \u2014 as I say, I would say mostly \u2014 habits maybe is not most \u2014 best word,\nbut your \u2014 your \u2014 the way you view life and the way you live life and the way you\ntake it. The way you either appreciate it \u2014 appreciate it, or the attitude that you have\nto life, it affects, 1-1t\u2019s \u2014 it permeates everything.",

        "A: No, not necessarily. No, but it has shaped your mind, it has shaped your thought,\nand that 1s where the change then comes in. No, it\u2019s not constantly on my mind. If it\nis I would be at \u2014 then it would be primarily negative. But it has changed your mind,\nand that is where it comes in.",

Then we have recently done some work in\nconnection with the claims by American soldiers at \u2014 or Americans who are seeking\nrestitution from Germany for incarceration in concentration camps.

For instance\nthere\u2019s some Austrians who work there in lieu of their military service. And it\u2019s\ninteresting to be around them, and to exchange ideas and see what they think, and so\non.

Not\nnecessarily a \u2014 a\u2014 well, a\u2014a sort of \u2014 a \u2014a \u2014 well, a\u2014 how should I say?

        "Q: You can flesh out the picture a little more.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: If you have friends, or \u2014 or have you encouraged other people or survivors to\nwork at the museum?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s ga \u2014 that\u2019s a highly personal sort of thing. I\u2019ve encouraged a lot of\npeople to go there, both friends and acquaintances. And I guess I think there are even\n\u2014 there are a couple of them that either are working there, or have in the past worked\nthere as a result. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I would not want to recommend somebody to work\nthere, if it doesn\u2019t come to them themselves. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not the sort of place, I mean,\nthat \u2014 I mean, it took me long time to take my wife there, for me to \u2014 for my wife to\ngo there. It depends \u2014 it depends on the individual. And it has to come out of them, I\ndon\u2019t think that it is nece \u2014 certainly somebody who is closely involved with it, who\nhas a personal experience and so on, I\u2019ve encouraged people to go to visit, but I\n109November 18, 1997\nwould \u2014 I would not encourage somebody to work there if they didn\u2019t get that idea\non their own.",
        "Q: Do you have any kind of special relationship with other volunteers who are\nsurvivors?",
        "A: No. I\u2014I don\u2019t really have too much of a contact with too many others, no.",
        "Q: Do you have any impressions of the museum\u2019s non-survivor staff and non-\nsurvivor volunteers?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Both Jewish and non-Jewish.",
        "A: Well, let me say this way. I \u2014 I have the feeling that being \u2014 I n \u2014I know there are\na number of survivors \u2014 first of all, of course, I have trouble with the word survivor. I\ndo not consider myself a survivor. I know people who\u2019 ve been in L\u00e9dz; they\u2019re\nsurvivors. Then of course then, I am not a survivor, I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a refugee, you can\ncall any sort of thing, but survivor, I don\u2019t feel I am. Then, of course, then there\u2019s the\n\u2014 the group in between, and that is, for instance, my wife, who is out \u2014 who was\nnever in a conce \u2014 went to \u2014 to England in a \u2014 in a children\u2019s transport. Had a much\ntougher time, and of course, most of all, lost her parents. Does she belong in the\nsurvivor cat \u2014 she doesn\u2019t consider herself to be a survivor. It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s very difficult,\nbut to me, the \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question. To my wife\u2019s cousin, who was in\nLodz, or was in \u2014 1n Auschwitz, no question either. It\u2019s that in-between, gray area.\n110November 18, 1997\nThat\u2019s one point. The second point 1s, I don\u2019t think that by virtue of being a survivor,\nyou become an expert. No, quite frankly, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve made myself very unpopular\nalready. I mean, I\u2019ve only attended one survivor group so far, and I\u2019ve made myself\nunpopular [indecipherable] by basically saying, just because somebody\u2019s a survivor,\nthey don \u2014 does not mean that they\u2019re necessarily the best guides. So ve been\naccused since then of being an academic, or being too \u2014 too feeling that you have to\nhave university degree and so on. Which isn\u2019t, of course, at all what I\u2019m talking\nabout. I\u2019m just saying that, being the be \u2014 being the best guide, or a guide, it\u2019s\ninteresting to be able to say to a group, this person lived through it, but that does not\nmake that \u2014 that\u2019s important, but it doesn\u2019t make necessarily a \u2014 a qualified guide, or\nthe best guide. There might be somebody who had no connection with it, and yet still\nis able to do a great job. So, I have a \u2014 perhaps a slightly different point of view than\nsome of my fellow volunteers.",

        "A: Well, my father was \u2014 ha-had in Europe a plumbing supply business, which at\none time arranged over parts of F-France, Switzerland and Germany. My mother\nhelped him, worked with him in the business, or was at home.",
        "A: I have one sister, Margot.",
        "A: She is five years older.",
        "A: I guess everybody more or less describes themselves as middle class, and I'll go\nalong with the same thing. Yeah, I would say solid middle class. Both my parents\ncame from rural town \u2014 from a rural town, and \u2014 but then, as I say, had this business,\nwhich was first loca \u2014 was initially located in Freiburg, in \u2014 where I was born.",
        "A: We lived on the edge of the city, let\u2019s put it this way, in a re \u2014 in a residential\narea.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: It was an apartment, it was an apartment 1n a \u2014 one of the typical houses, cou \u2014 la-\nlarge houses, in which there were, I think, two or three apartments.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, it certainly was not a Jewish neighborhood. Since I left there\nby the time I was about six or seven, I really don\u2019t know very much about the\nreligious make-up of the area, but I would say it was \u2014 it was a \u2014 a typical urban area,\nand certainly not a Jewish area.",
        "A: Let me amend that, actually was 1933, so by that time I was eight years old.",
        "A: I did start school in that location, went to primary school there, yes. I remember\nquite well, I \u2014 I do remember c-certain bits and pieces. I can vi-vividly recall the\narea, of course especially so since I\u2019ve visited it since then again. It was \u2014 it was a\ngood life. We \u2014 we had household help, and as I say, my parents \u2014 my dad used to be\ntraveling quite a bit as a \u2014 selling for his business, but my mother was home all the\ntime.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I would say nominally so, for the holidays, and went to the synagogue\noccasionally, or on Saturdays, regular Saturday services. So I would say sort of \u2014\nwell, how would you describe it?",
        "A: Oh yes, all the holidays were observed, yes.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014 not \u2014 not that I recall, no, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well, there was a fairly sizeable family, not in a town where we lived, but where\nmy parents had come from, and that \u2014 since that was only about 20 miles away.\nThere was, by today\u2019s standards, a very close, nearby extended family. Of course, in\nthose days 20 miles was a fairly substantial distance.",
        "A: Oh yes, we often did. And in addition to that actually, one of my uncles, at times\nworked with my father in his business.",
        "A: No, neither one, I would say, was either p \u2014 was really politically oriented or \u2014 or\nactive.",
        "A: No, they were not.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: We spoke German.",
        "A: Ye \u2014 well, some, not very much. I mean, we\u2019re \u2014 we \u2014 since we left in April of\n1933, this was very shortly after Hitler\u2019s actual rise to power, there wasn\u2019t really all\nthat much. Yes, there were the \u2014 there was the occasional bully, but actually I ran\ninto that later on, much more so.",
        "A: Well, on April 1, 1933, there was a boycott of Jewish business in Germany,\nwhich was actually one of the \u2014 the first centrally orchestrated anti-Jewish outbreak\nor outburst of activity. And we packed up and went off to Switzerland, where by\nthat time a ma \u2014 a major branch of the business was located in Basel. So in 1933, we\nwent \u2014 went off to Basel, Switzerland.",
        "A: Well, it was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t all that cut and dried. We stayed in Basel for a while. As\nbest as I recall, we did not get permission to stay permanently in Basel. I remember\nNovember 18, 1997\nwe lived in a hotel for quite a while. And then we moved to France, across the\nborder into France, into Saint-Louis. Again [indecipherable] across the border\nfrom Basel.",
        "A: I really can\u2019t recall. I really don\u2019t know. But to my \u2014 well, it was an interesting\nadventure. I wasn\u2019t that wild in \u2014 being in school, and I was being pulled out of\nschool, and off we went to Basel. So I really \u2014 I must admit, I do not know. I do not\nrecall.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sure \u2014 I\u2019m sure he did, but exactly what he meant to me at that point, I\nmean, I\u2019m sure it was not \u2014 I wa\u2014 I mu \u2014 I must have picked it up from \u2014 I mean, I\nwa \u2014 I was receptive enough, I think, to pick these things up from my surroundings,\nbut if you asked me what I thought of them exactly, and \u2014 and what way it came to\nme, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: That depends whom you ask. No, I don\u2019t think I was really all that independent. I\nhad a \u2014 well, I\u2014I liked being by myself. I was probably rather introspective, and like\nat that point already, and this came out much later, we liked reading a great deal,\nNovember 18, 1997\nliked playing with construction toys. In other words, activities that are usually singul\n\u2014 done by one person. I can\u2019t recall ever having though, certainly at that time having\na \u2014a circle of friends. I mean, I knew people, but nose \u2014 no big circle of friends.",
        "A: Margot.",
        "A: No, just the f\u2014 no, just the four of us.",
        "A: No. As I say, I don\u2019t think I had a very large, or a circle of friends at that point.",
        "A: Well, we settled for a while in the hotel in Basel. And after that when \u2014\napparently my parents did not get permission to stay in Basel, or they \u2014 or thought it\nappropriate otherwise. I must admit I never did find, never did ask. We moved across\nthe border to Saint-Louis, which is in France, and lived there. And I went to school\nin Saint-Louis, both my sister and I did, in a local school there.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: None whatsoever. Well, you know you, a-at that age if you get thrown into this\nsort of environment \u2014 the people there obviously do speak German or a Swiss\ndialect, or a Swiss type of dialect, or whatever you want to call the Alsace \u2014 the\nAlsatian manner of speaking. And so \u2014 but French obviously was \u2014 was \u2014 was\ndifficult, and we had a\u2014 we spent a limited amount of time in Switzerland \u2014 in\nFrance.",
        "A: To the best of my recollection, un \u2014 until late \u2014 sometime middle, late 1934. In\nother words, about \u2014 I would say about a year.",
        "A: No unpleasant experiences to the extent that I know now \u2014 that I can recall, no.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: A, I probably didn\u2019t question it too much. B, I guess at that time already, my\nparents were under a great deal of strain, certainly a lot more than I was. And while\nNovember 18, 1997\none develops a certain type of closeness as a result, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not quite the same as a\n\u2014as acloseness which develops in \u2014 in tranc \u2014 peace and tranquility.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall that I had any fears. I suspect that my parents probably were anxious\nto \u2014 limited my fears to the maximum possible, so \u2014",
        "A: No, we were a little bit \u2014 we were apart \u2014 five years apart. I would say that\ncommunication is prob \u2014 was probably more \u2014 even more difficult tha-than with my\nparents, because the \u2014 the \u2014 the five year age difference between the youngsters is \u2014\nis pretty substantial.",
        "A: Well, in 1934, I believe it was, the French, having received a large number of\nrefugees \u2014 at this point we had largely given up our business in Freiburg in\nGermany, and still had the business in Switzerland and in France. At that point I\nbelieve it was that the French authorities basically said to the refugees in \u2014 many had\nsettled along the border here, that it was necessary for them to go inland a certain\ndistance, or to leave. In other words, residence along the border was not \u2014 was\nfrowned upon, or in fact, forbidden. And so my parents really had a choice to make;\ndo they want to go inland? And is \u2014 if I remember correctly, I think the closest they\ncould go to would be the city \u2014 the town of Merceuil or, do they want to leave \u2014 and,\nNovember 18, 1997\nwhich would of course made pretty well impossible the business \u2014 maintaining the\nbusiness in Switzerland, and while he \u2014 to a certain extent, the business in France,\nwhich was also very close to the border.",
        "A: Oh yes, we \u2014 we still had our business. And so we packed up and moved back to\nGermany. And we did not move back to Freiburg, we moved to a town called\nLoerrach, l-o-e \u2014 double r-a-c-h.",
        "A: That is \u2014 well, everything is n \u2014 well, a-again, it\u2019s one of those things that today\nit\u2019s very close, in the old days it was quite far. It\u2019s only about two miles from the\nSwiss border. It was about three miles as the crow flies from Saint-Louis. In other\nwords, they were all [indecipherable] or not, at the point where the \u2014 the Rhine\nRiver makes its bend, where the free countries meet. It was about, oh I would say, 40\n- 50 miles from Freiburg. So we \u2014 we got back there fairly frequently, but it \u2014 it still\n\u2014 in those days it was a fairly long distance.",
        "A: No, it was quite easy. A-Again, for a time we lived in a guesthouse, a \u2014 a local\nhotel near the swi \u2014 again, very close to the Swiss border. I would say \u2014 as I say,\nabout the mile. And then eventually moved into an apartment in the center of town.\nNovember 18, 1997\nAnd that must have been either 1934 or early 1935. By that time my sister did not\ncome back, or came back and then she was sent to a school in France, a \u2014 what is it?",
        "A: Boarding school in France, and she went there. A place called Remy\nAchmont(ph). And I started going to school in Loerrach.",
        "A: Yes, at that point things obviously started tightening up 1-1n \u2014 in many different\nways. The business was still going, the German business was still going, although by\nthat time I \u2014 I think the \u2014 the main part \u2014 we-well, the \u2014 or no, I\u2019m sorry. There was\nno more business in Germany, the business was largely in Switzerland, and\nprobably to a much lesser extent in France. But we lived. It was a nice, large\napartment in a big apartment house.",
        "A: Yes. To \u2014 whether or not he went \u2014 yes, I\u2019m quite sure he went back to France as\nwell, but I do know he went to Switzerland. And he would travel in Switzerland. I\nwould sometimes go with him, and we often went to Basel, it was the ni \u2014 the closest\nlarge city.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you begin to notice things like this, but one of the things,\nI mean, in \u2014 in that part of Germany, anti-Semitism wasn\u2019t probably quite as\nvirulent as it was in other parts of Germany. In other words, the \u2014 in the s \u2014 in the\nsouthwest of Germany, I think people were slightly more relaxed, and I think this\nwas true for quite a bit of time. And \u2014 but yes, there were obviously signs. I knew I\nwas Jewish, I went to a German school. I went \u2014 first finished sec \u2014 f \u2014 well, by that\ntime I guess I had \u2014 I'd finished secondary school \u2014 primary school, I was then in the\n[indecipherable] schule, secondary school. I had a number of friends, but 1t was \u2014 it\nwas obviously noticeable. One didn\u2019t count the certain problems. You had the\nnormal sort of bully.",
        "A: Well, I guess bullies are probably pretty well the same all over. No, not \u2014 nothing\nparticular. I do know that after the war I went back looking for him, but he wasn\u2019t\nthere any more.",
        "A: No, not that I recall, not that I recall. I was not, you know, a \u2014 it was, again, I was\nprobably rather introspective, I was not very good at sports, so even if, you know, if\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou \u2014 if they chose sports teams or teams for games and so on, I was usually one of\nthe last picked. However, I do not attribute that necessarily to my being Jewish. I\nsuspect I just wasn\u2019t very good at it.",
        "A: It was no \u2014 there was no resentment or anything like that on my part. I felt I was\nJewish, and that\u2019s the way things are, and I was perfectly \u2014 perfectly satisfied and no\n\u2014no s\u2014no special feelings about it.",
        "A: Well, actually, at that point, mainly I would say I liked construction toys. We \u2014\nthe family often went out for walks, that wasn\u2019t necessarily what I would have\nchosen to do, but that\u2019s what we did. No, no other great hobbies. I did have a \u2014 at\nthat \u2014 during this period, I ha \u2014 which actually lasted for a long time, I had a\nneighbor, next door neighbor, a \u2014 a young, a friend, an Aryan, German, with whom I\nwas friendly until we left eventually Germany, and he joined eventually \u2014 he \u2014 I\nthink he became a Hitler \u2014 member of the Hitler Youth. But you know, that was just\none of those things that one had to do, or did, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah, he felt comfortable in our house and I felt comfortable in his. I\nhad some Jewish friends.",
        "A: Well, yeah, it was \u2014 it was the local \u2014",
        "A: It was the local public school, and there was not a very large Jewish presence in\nthat town, yes. So it was \u2014 it was \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many \u2014 I suspect\nyou had less than one percent or two percent Jews in the school.",
        "A: Some \u2014 I would say yes, I had a couple of teachers who were, I felt probably went\nout of their way to be nice. That actually came, I guess a bit later, but I had one\nteacher who, if you wanted to, I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know what \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I -\nmaybe I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in a minority. I \u2014 you can find anti-Semitism anyplace if you look\nfor it hard enough. That assumes that nothing bad ever happens to anybody who\u2019s\nnot Jewish. In other words, you know, a teacher can be mean, or \u2014 or you can\nattribute to anti-Semitism. On the other hand, they\u2019re mean to other kids as well. So,\nto answer your questions, it wasn\u2019t terribly bad, in th \u2014 I had some teachers, a couple\nof teachers that I would have preferred not to have. On the other hand, I had a couple\nthat in retrospect, I think went out of their way to be nice.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh, there must have been. I\u2019m sure there was. Can\u2019t recall, but I\u2019m quite sure.",
        "A: No, no, we di \u2014 we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Gee. Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of difficult to \u2014 to \u2014 wha-what one felt like at\nthat point. Obviously I knew my \u2014 my folks were having increasing problems. This\nbecame very obvious, a lot more obvious as my mother became more and more\ntense. My father was perhaps somewhat more relaxed, but my mother certainly\nbecame increasingly tense. So one picks it up, it\u2019s not very difficult.",
        "A: Well, a nervousness, a sort of a\u2014 she, I think, developed stomach ulcers, had\nother problems. But for instance for \u2014 I remember for stomach ulcers she went to\nSwitzerland to get treated. So it was still quite possible to go back and forth.",
        "A: Oh heavens yes, that was \u2014 I may not have been very good at sports, but I\u2019m a\ngreat spectator or listener, yes.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014I sort of had, I remember I sort of had mixed feelings. On one hand, I\nwas still interested in the German athletes. On the other hand, you liked to see them\nNovember 18, 1997\noccasionally get beaten. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I looked at it purely or primarily as a sports\nevent, not as a political event at that point.",
        "A: No, at that time I \u2014 since I knew nobody \u2014 what I found out in the meantime,\nlearned in the meantime is one thing, but at that point I did not know. I mean, no.",
        "A: Well, no, and obviously didn\u2019t admire them. But one had a healthy respect for \u2014\nyou can call it fear, or whatever it is, yes. And of course, starting about 1936, then\nthings started getting tougher. As I say again, until 1936, it wasn\u2019t all that bad in that\npart of the world.",
        "A: Well, then of course things started with \u00b037 - \u00b038.",
        "A: None that I can recall, that we had particular restrictions.",
        "A: No, but I suspect they was somewhere my parents felt they weren\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t\nwelcome, and we wouldn\u2019t go there. I certainly didn\u2019t know of any place. I mean, I \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997\nI \u2014 I was aware of course, then came the Nuremberg laws about then. I was aware of\nthose.",
        "A: Pretty weird. You \u2014 you \u2014 you begin \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say one begins to accept it, but\none lives with it, and it\u2019s amazing one does.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I had any particular feelings about that. I mean, I would \u2014 I suspect,\nas I know a lot of people did, as perhaps my parents or my father did, and \u2014 but even\nthat he \u2014 no, I can\u2019t recall him expressing that, but I would \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have been \u2014\nwould \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he had.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t. I was living in a slightly different world, let\u2019s put it this way. A\nworld that was not in the mainstream, but it was still at that point, normal enough to\nfeel that, you know, one \u2014 one \u2014 one just lived in a \u2014 in another group, which\nobviously was being \u2014 was disadvantaged to a certain extent, or being \u2014 being \u2014 oh,\nhow should one say? Considered not quite on the same level, but I tha \u2014",
        "A: No, I definitely did not.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, not that I can recall. Things did happen in \u201938 which were obviously\nfrightening, but \u201936 - \u00b037, not really, no.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Actually, preceding that, I guess I should say, I was sufficiently aware when the\nRhineland was being \u2014 being occupied, that my antenna sort of perked up, and at\nthat point began to realize that there were certain problems in the air. In 1938 of\ncourse \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014 yes, yes, I did. I had a Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: Well, it was a Bar Mitzvah, it was in \u2014 in Loerrach. I remember I got a bicycle.\nNow this was obviously not the most important thing, but it\u2019s one of the things I still\nremember. Yes, and the other day actually, somebody showed me a picture of me at\nmy bar \u2014 taken at my Bar Mitzvah. So yes, it was the relatives, to the extent that they\nhad not yet left. Now, in the meantime I should say this: in 1936 or \u201937, my sister \u2014 I\nguess 1936, my sister left from \u2014 came back from her boarding school, and then went\noff to the United States. My parents sent her to the U.S., and she \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, we had relatives \u2014 by that time we had certain relatives that had in the\nmeantime, left Germany. And we had relatives who lived here long time, and she\ngot her affidavit that way. And so she came to the United States, I believe it was\n1936. We had some other relatives, an uncle who left there. I think they probably left\nin 1937. My mother\u2019s stepmother \u2014 in other words, my grandmother, she left and\njoined two of her \u2014 one of her daughters. So the family at that point was leaving. In\nfact, the only ones that were le \u2014 staying behind was our family.",
        "A: Well, they were trying to leave. I think one of the key problems, of course, was\nhaving a business. The Germans were very reluctant. They were \u2014 they were\nperfectly willing to let them go, provided that they were sure that all foreign\nexchange had been repatriated to Germany, and exchanged into good German\nmarks. And to convince them of that, of course took a long time. So I would say my\nparents probably applied for a \u2014 for emigration to the United States probably in \u2014 I\nwould \u2014 my guess would be 1937 or early \u201938. One of the problems, of course at that\npoint is my father had been in the German army, had been wounded in the army,\nearned str \u2014 in fact, he had been wounded three times, he had earned the Iron Cross,\netcetera, etcetera. And as the Germans were wont to say, the thank of the Fatherland,\nNovember 18, 1997\nyou can be assured of the thanks of your Fatherland. And a great many actually, I\nthink, World War II \u2014 World War I killed a lot of people, and that World War II\npeople, who felt that they were safe, because of the big to-do that the Germans\nalways made about their World War I soldiers. In fact, the other day I ran across, in\ngoing through some of my father\u2019s things, a certificate. In 1936 he received a special\nmedal, which apparently at that point was being given to all former front line soldiers\nin World War I.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: So, in World War \u2014 as I say, perhaps among former German frontline soldiers, the\nurgency, the feeling that they had to get out of Germany was not quite as great as it\nwas among the general po \u2014 Jewish population. But anyhow, by that time, of course,\nthen in 1938, a great many things happened. By that time the \u2014 I think it was\nprobably in 1938 that the French \u2014 the Swiss started restricting access to Jews. This\nis when passports were stamped with a big J, although that may have been in 1939. I\ndo know that my father started encountering problems of driving \u2014 of going into\nSwitzerland. About that time, and again I can\u2019t recall exactly whether it was before\nNovember 18, 1997\nthe events of November 1938, or after, Jews, the \u2014 the use of cars was restricted. In\nother words, things started getting pretty rough. In 19 no \u2014",
        "A: No, no restrictions, we celebrated it. It was not a big festivity, but it was \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 I mean, one \u2014 one didn\u2019t \u2014 you certainly didn\u2019t do anything ostentatious at that\npoint. But as I recall, it re \u2014 it was celebrated and it was \u2014 we had a \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. No, no question about that.",
        "A: No \u2014 well, I have a recollection of it happening, and \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure we talked about it. I\u2019m not sure we did. Keep in mind again, parents\nat that point were somewhat wary as to what they said to their kids. They really\ndidn\u2019t know \u2014 I mean, you were always \u2014 at that point, it had gotten to \u2014 by \u00b037 - \u201938,\nit had gotten to the point where one watched very carefully what one said, and had to\nwatch carefully what one said. Things change really substantially after around \u00b036 -\n\u00b037. And therefore \u2014 well, parents obviously alerted their children, as my parents did\nme, what I should or should not do.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I mean, just watching what you do, where you go and what you say.",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you obviously did not go to large demonstrations or\nmarches through town an-and \u2014 and things like that.",
        "A: No, not too many. No, not too many. Except the regional Hitler Youth\nheadquarters was about a half a block from our house, and I remember Baldur von\nSchirach, who at that point was the head of the Hitler Youth. Yes, I remember\nseeing him from a distance. The next time I saw him was 1946 in Nuremberg.",
        "A: Yes, at this time you became more wary, you \u2014 you did. I mean, you started\nassociating it obviously with \u2014 with certain events, things that took place, fears.\nWhether you yourself experienced them, or others did. At that point you started\nseeing \u201cDer Stiirmer,\u201d Streicher\u2019s newspapers on display all over town \u2014 various\nparts of town. And so yes, at that point things started getting \u2014 getting a lot \u2014 lot\ntougher.",
        "A: No, except, as I say, my one personal bully. But even that was limited. But yes, I\nwould \u2014 I can\u2019t really recall any physical problem. I do know that fairly frequently I\nNovember 18, 1997\nwould take different routes home, to get home, get out of his way and so on. I cannot\nrecall they were being attacked, and I\u2019m sure I would remember that. So \u2014 but you\nknow, the-there was a definite fear there.",
        "A: Well, I felt both, I would say. Yeah, I would say you \u2014 you \u2014 you feel both. You\ndo \u2014 you \u2014 keep in mind, we did not have that large or active a Jewish population.\nThere was no Jewish area in the town. The number of Jews living in \u2014 1n town, you\ncould count on \u2014 on \u2014 on a couple of fingers. I did have, as I say, I had one Jewish\nfriend. He and I got together fairly frequently. I would say I \u2014 actually I had two\nfriends, one German, one \u2014 one Aryan and one Jewish.",
        "A: Yes. The synagogue was supported, and we would often go to Saturday morning\nservices, certainly every holiday, etcetera.",
        "A: Now you\u2019re asking something that I really don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Well, it couldn\u2019t have been terribly good, because at that point my sister was in\nNew York, most of my re-relatives had left the country. My dad\u2019s ability to earn a\nliving had pretty well shrunk to probably virtually zero, or certainly not much more\nthan that. So it could not have been a joyous occasion, let\u2019s put it this way. And I\nNovember 18, 1997\nguess we said next year in Jerusalem probably with a little more fervor than we had\nin the past.",
        "A: Gee. I don\u2019t recall any particular time. I was still going to school, I was still going\nto the German school. As a small child, when we were living in Freiburg and\nprobably early Loerrach, I used to go to a\u2014 a Jewish summer camp. But certainly\nnot at that point any more. So I probably got into a certain amount of mischief and\nspent the summer that way with my friends.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m \u2014 again, I\u2019m quite sure we were talking about it, but it was \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I\nw \u2014 I would say it was one of the subjects, 1t was certainly not the subject of\nconversation. But he \u2014 he and I got along quite well.",
        "A: Peter Wyle(ph). Peter and I got along quite well, we \u2014 we played together, we\nmet after school, etcetera. If I recall correctly, he went to \u2014 I can\u2019t recall whether \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t go to the same school I went, I can\u2019t recall where he went. But anyhow.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I was a shrimp. No, I was very small, yes. Actually I was \u2014 any picture you \u2014 I\nhave, it\u2019s hard to believe at this point. I was very small, yes, and very \u2014 and actually\nthe only \u2014I only started growing about 1941 - \u201942, yes.",
        "A: Then \u2014 then, of course, comes Kristallnacht, and the day my parents went off,\nhaving heard \u2014 I\u2019m sure having heard that men were being picked up, being arrested\nat that point, my parents left town.",
        "A: In our town not very much. The synagogue was \u2014 the synagogue was burned \u2014\nwas \u2014 I bel \u2014 yes, the synagogue I think was destroyed, it wasn\u2019t burned or \u2014\ndamaged, trashed.",
        "A: Well, at that point, of course, one was getting used \u2014 not getting used to it, I\nmean, this was just one of many. But more importantly, my parents left Loerrach to\ngo to Freiburg.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: No, without me. I was staying in Loerrach, I was staying at home. And my\nmother came back alone, my father was recognized on the street in Freiburg and\narrested. And he was then off to Dachau concentration camp. Now that \u2014 at that\npoint, things were obviously very bad, so I was at home with my mother. Of course,\nat that time we were \u2014 school was no longer \u2014 you \u2014 Jews were no longer welcomed\nin \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the local schools. So that didn\u2019t particularly bother me, I wasn\u2019t that\ngreat a student anyhow. In fact, if I remember correctly, I probably would have\nflunked Latin in that year, if 1t hadn\u2019t been for that. And, but then yo \u2014",
        "A: No, I did not feel cheated at that point, but as I say, my \u2014 my dad was now off in\nconcentration camp, and my mother and I struggle along at home. I \u2014",
        "A: Well, under \u2014 under the circumstance I guess she coped very well, but she was not\neasy to live with, and I don\u2019t see why she should be. I mean, you know at that stage\nof the game, the \u2014 the woman had a pretty tough time. I mean, I had it tough, but she\nhad it a lot tougher.",
        "A: Yes.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, that was not a problem at that point. And then of course, probably \u2014\nwell, it was about the middle of December, about five weeks after, we \u2014 I remember\nvividly at getting a phone call at 11 o\u2019clock at night, my father saying he\u2019s at the\nrailroad station in Munich, and he\u2019s coming home. There\u2019s certain things that one\nremembers vividly, and this was one of them.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we knew where he wa \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 he may have written once, but we\nknew where he was, in other words.",
        "A: To get away \u2014 presumably to get away, in the event \u2014 because word was around\nthat they were picking up Jewish males.",
        "A: So they thought \u2014 so they thought they\u2019d be safer in Freiburg, and of course,\nhaving previously lived in Freiburg, somebody obviously pointed them out to\nsomebody, and he was arrested on the street. And as a result, my mother, who was\nnot a very good driver \u2014 we \u2014 well, actually, she was, she had to drive home by\nherself. Come back by car, driving home, which must have been quite a \u2014 quite an\nexperience. About that time my father was no longer able, even before then, if I\nNovember 18, 1997\nremember correctly, he was not \u2014 no longer able to go into Switzerland\noccasionally; my mother and I would go. But of course, after that, no, that was the\nend of that.",

        "A: Well, at that point he was 1n his mid-50s. No, mid\u201940s, late 40s. So \u2014",
        "A: Not at that point. Again, that\u2019s \u2014 you know, they wer \u2014 they \u2014 they used to be \u2014\nthere used to be a standing joke in Germany that where one man meets somebody\nwho has just come back from concentration camp, and he said, how was \u2014 his friend\nasks him how was it. And the fellow who was there says, it\u2019s great. You know, they\nwoke us every morning with \u2014 with Beethoven\u2019s Third Symphony, and then we had\na leisurely breakfast, etcetera, etcetera. And of course his friend said, gee, that\u2019s not\nthe way my other neighbor tells it. He says yes, but he\u2019s there again. So, you didn\u2019t\ntalk terribly much about it. This of course was the \u2014 th-the word \u2014 at that point things\nbecame terribly oppressive, and as a\u2014 as a\u2014 as a youngster you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you\nknew it, and you started \u2014 you lived with it, and you \u2014 that was \u2014 that was the \u2014 you\nNovember 18, 1997\nknew you \u2014 one wrong step might be dangerous to you or to your family and so on.\nAn-And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s pretty tough.",
        "A: Well, I feel I\u2019ve really \u2014 to go to \u2014 1n retrospect, I mean, we lost much of our\nchildhood, after, I would say from \u2014 from age 10 on, there wasn\u2019t all that much of a\nchildhood \u2014 normal childhood, of course. We had one interesting experience about\nthat time, and that is we had the Gestapo in our house. Now my experien \u2014 this is an\nexperience that this was actually \u2014 may have been shortly before or after my dad was\nin Dachau. We had our books at home, and we \u2014 they came in and started going\nthrough our \u2014 our books. And they acted just like CPAs did, and it was perfectly \u2014 I\nmean, it was a \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Our fi \u2014 I mean, this is what \u2014 this is what the Germans were interested in,\nof course, in our family.

        "A: Yeah, at that point they still were. This however, may also have been earlier, just\nmay have been in 1938, but I suspect it was probably in early 1939 that this\nhappened. And then in April of \u2014 about April of 1939, I went off on the\nKindertransport to Switzerland.",

I\nended up in a small, Swiss town, and I\u2019m \u2014 well, that\u2019s not even a good size village\n[indecipherable] in a tiny little Swiss village with a Swiss farmer who had just a\nlittle before that, lost his boy in an accident.",

        "A: Well, as good as the Swiss \u2014 German Swiss talks German, yes. Yes, they did talk\na certain type of German, which I picked up and have retained. I stayed wi \u2014 lived\nwith them, and then it came fall, I re \u2014",

In fact, I don\u2019t\nthink that \u2014 well, there was a Jewish family, these are the people I met again not too\nlong ago. They were about 10 - 15 miles \u2014 10 miles away.",
        "A: Oh no, there was somebody on the train, there was somebody who met me and\nthen arranged for me to go on. I don\u2019t recall whether they went with me, and I was\nsort of passed on from one to the other.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah, I would write, occasionally I would call. My parents had the\ntelephone yet. And we would be \u2014 we would be in touch. And it was \u2014 it \u2014 that\nsummer, I remember I agitated for going back to school.

        "A: Oh God. Well, let me put it this way, yes I worked on the farm. We did \u2014 it was \u2014\nit was a dairy farmer, he had cows, a few cows, about 15 - 20. And so it was dairy,\nwe lived across the street from the dairy co \u2014 the milk collection point. And yes, I\nwas supposed to watch the cows out in the field, wasn\u2019t very good at it. Couple times\nthey got away from me, and of course they knew where home was, and they just \u2014\nthe fee \u2014 and the Swiss village, the village in the center, and then fields around it, and\nlike most European farms, the f \u2014 the \u2014 the fields were sort of divided up. In other\nwords, your farmer would have one field east of town and maybe another one north\nof town and so on. So we had these cows out there and every now and then when the\ncows wanted to go home and nobody came to get us, the cows just went home. I\nmean, I was not terribly successful as a cow herder. And every now and then I would\ntrail the cows into town and shoo them in the other way around. I was supposed to\nlead them back. But, every now \u2014 and of course when they go, they won\u2019t go ina\nstraight line, which means they go across the fields of the neighbors and so on. We\ndid a certain amount of damage. I was not \u2014 I was not a great asset to the family, let\u2019s\nput it this way.",
        "A: Yes, very much so, obviously. I mean, as I say, these people tried very hard, and I\n\u2014I\u2014 you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 they \u2014 they did it, they had received no pay, they\ndid it purely in order \u2014 and I don\u2019t think they did it in order to get another farm\nNovember 18, 1997\nhelper, I mean, that was not their \u2014 that \u2014 that was definitely not their reason. If they\ndid, they sure lost out. No, they did it for humanitarian purposes.",
        "A: No, they were not. She was more religious than he was, but no.",
        "A: They definitely did not try to convert me. And then of course it was there that the\n\u2014 the ki \u2014 the social center of a very small Swiss village at that point, was the\ncollection po \u2014 the dairy collection point, the local dairy, where everybody came\nevery morning and every evening to deliver their milk. So if there were any\nannouncements of anything, this impor \u2014 of importance, this 1s where it would take\nplace. People didn\u2019t have telephones. And, in fact, I used to have to go to the post\noffice to make phone calls home. And it was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I must say also, I had relatives\nin Zurich, so I had somebody that I could be in touch with, it wasn\u2019t that I was\ncompletely alone in that respect. One of the most \u2014 the things I remember most\ndistinctly, and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming\ninterested in history and politics and so on, cause I remember when \u2014 when the\nGerman Russian non-aggression pact was signed, I prin \u2014 I announced that this\nmeans ya \u2014 war in Europe. Then of course I few week \u2014 couple weeks later, it\nactually started. And the announcements for \u2014 mobilization announcements of course\nwere posted at the milk collecting station. This is where everybody came to. That\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas early in the morning when we got up and by noon everybody was getting on the\nlocal streetcar in a\u2014 1n a uniform. So, you know, Swiss \u2014 Swiss males took their\nuniforms home and their wife will sew them after doing their military service. So it\nwas a matter of \u2014 within a matter of hours that they had \u2014 could mobilize the troops.\nActually, the kids were mobilized too. I remember that at that point the swi \u2014 the kids\nwere organized through the school, and I think I was part of the group that was\nsupposed to help drive the cattle into the mountains. Judging from my experience in\ncattle driving before that, I\u2019m not sure I would have contributed very much to the\nSwiss war effort, if it had of come to that. But it \u2014 fortunately didn\u2019t. So I stayed\nthere, but as I say, there were certain \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we had certain, how shall we\nsay, there were cer \u2014 a certain amount of friction between the family. I\u2019m not \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know who \u2014 to whom to attribute it, I\u2019m sure I shared it, I probably was a\ndisappointment to them. I was not being ruralized very quickly while I was there.\nAnd so I think in December of 1939, I was move \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Certainly by mail, prob \u2014 also later on certainly, but I remember making at\nleast a couple of phone calls, yes. And then I was moved to another family, they\narranged for me to be transferred. And I was then moved to a family, about\nDecember, on the other side of Lake Zurich, up in the mountains. A fundamentalist\nNovember 18, 1997\nChristian family. They li \u2014 he was a \u2014 he was a gardener, and sold flowers and sold \u2014\nan-and raised flowers and so on. And that was a totally different experience. This\nwas a refined family. And again, absolutely no effort made to convert me. They bent\nover backwards to respect my Jewishness. And I stayed with them until May of\n1940.",
        "A: Oh yes, I became an avid newspaper reader. Have be \u2014 have been one ever since,\nyes. No, no, I ke \u2014I kept pretty well up to date.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well, you didn\u2019t need that, but \u2014 but obviously then. Of course, one had\nno \u2014 what was happening to Jews was not at that point front page news. It of course\nhadn\u2019t \u2014 also hadn\u2019t started that way, you know. Germans were still \u2014 at that point\nwere still encouraging emigration. And \u2014 but what was happening, yes, very\ndefinitely.",
        "A: Oh no, no.",
        "A: Oh yeah \u2014 well, I wa \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there that terribly long, but the family certainly\nfully accepted me. And I did not \u2014 at that point I did not go back to school once I \u2014\nhaving been up there. I think I helped them in \u2014 in their business and so on. I knew I\nwould be leaving quite soon, or I assumed I would be leaving quite soon. But no, it\nwas \u2014 it was my f-\u2014 in neither place did I encounter the slightest anti-Semitism or \u2014\nor feeling of \u2014 of \u2014 of not being wanted or anything like that.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yeah. First one not necessarily very happy, but safe, yes. And as I say,\nthe \u2014 the second family was totally different. In fact, I think they continued sending\nme \u201cThe Watchtower\u201d for about 20 years. No, they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they were a\nlovely family.",
        "A: I was afraid you were gonna ask that.",
        "A: Well, then came \u2014 then came the next thing, and that was in May of 1940, my\nparents were called to Stuttgart to get their American visa. And I went back to\nGermany to also get my visa. We got back \u2014 I got back to Germany, it must have\nbeen about the sixth or seventh of May. We went off to zi \u2014 to Stuttgart where the\nAmerican consulate was located. I remember reading on the morning of May 10\", a\nGerman newspaper in \u2014 while sitting in the American consulate. There was a\n42November 18, 1997\nnewspaper it said that a silly be \u2014 it was a German newspaper, obviously. But this\nsilly rumor was circulating that Germans were amassing troops f \u2014 aga \u2014 against the\nwestern front.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 18, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: 1940 is right. 1940, and that\u2019s the day we got our \u2014 our visa. We then scooted\nback to Loerrach, stayed there I believe about two or three days. In the meantime,\nFreiburg had been bombed, the first German city to be bombed in response to the\ninvasion of the lowland; I think three planes came over. And we were then, I believe,\nabout the 15\" of May we were in Genoa, in Italy.",
        "A: Well, actually, we knew Freiburg had been bombed because the train took us\nthrough Freiburg, but you couldn\u2019t see anything. No, not \u2014 not particularly, at that\nNovember 18, 1997\npoint I think I felt this is a pretty good idea. It was not much of a bombing, as\nbombings went later on, as I say. Three planes apparently came over, and since any\ntime a place in Germany was bombed, it was bound to hit a hospital or a school, if\nyou listened to that, and I think they said a school had been hit. But anyhow, very\nfew people, very few casualties. But it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 it was \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel any\nparticular regret, let me put it this way. Interesting \u2014",
        "A: About the bombing having taken place [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, at that stage of the game, I certainly no longer felt like a German, let\u2019s put it\nthis way.",
        "A: Gee, I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I d \u2014I don\u2019t know. But anyhow, what was\ninteresting was tro \u2014 taking the train from Freiburg or from Loerrach. The train\ngoes a \u2014 went along the Rhine River, going north before it turned eastward to\nStuttgart. This was the border between France and Germany and of course this\nwas before be \u2014 this being the ninth \u2014 May eighth or ninth. This was during the days\nof the \u2014 of the so called Sitzkrieg and nothing going on. And you could easily look\ninto France. And the French obviously saw the train on the German side, and\nnobody did anything to anybody. Going back, it was quite different. Going back,\nNovember 18, 1997\nwhenever you ca \u2014 when you came to \u2014 near the Rhine, the train stopped, and then\nyou were bused to a place where the Rhine \u2014 no longer the border, or the train was\nno longer within view of the tra \u2014 of the \u2014 the \u2014 the French military. In other words,\nthey finally started shooting at each other a little bit. And this started on the 10\" of\nMay, of course. But anyhow, we went back to Loerrach. Presumably \u2014 I can\u2019t recall,\nbut we collected some effects, things had been packed already and so on, and \u2014 what\nhadn\u2019t been sold or given away. And we went off, over the Brenner Pass to Italy, to\nGenoa, and I think we arrived there about the 15\". Now one of the things that had\nbeen \u2014 we also did while we were in Stuttgart was, my father went to the Italian\nconsulate to get a visa for Italy. He speeded things up by making a quote, charitable\ncontribution, unquote, to some Italian charity, and he got his visa the same day. This\nwas on the 10\" of May. And by the 15\" we were in Italy, and by the 18\" we were\naboard ship, on our way to the U.S.",
        "A: Stressful \u2014 well, until you were \u2014 you were across the border, obviously at that\npoint, I mean, yes. You were stressful if \u2014 and \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014 nothing. I mean, it was \u2014 it was like any border, 1t was a border crossing in\nEurope in the old days. It was a fairly careful control, but that was \u2014 that was\nNovember 18, 1997\nsomething one was used to. In other words, the \u2014 the days of easy \u2014 this was not the\ndays of easy border crossings for anybody. And so they would check the luggage,\nand they would check the passports, etcetera.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure my parents did. I don\u2019t recall what it was, but I\u2019m sure they did. But you\nlearn, by that point, not to open your mouth unnecessarily, even though that was\ndifficult sometimes.",
        "A: Oh yes, very much so. Yeah, at this point, I mean, 1t may have been the \u2014 the\ncountry of my birth, but I certainly had no warm feelings towards it, that \u2014 that\u2019s the\nnature of the game. Th-The events of the past two or three years had pretty well\ntaken care of that.",

        "A: The George Washington. Good name. And of course, while we were in the high\nseas, Italy \u2014",
        "A: It was a U.S. line, I guess United States line, I\u2019m not sure, but \u2014 and while we\nwere in the high seas, of course, Italy declared war on France, which would have\ncut that route off, so it was the last ship, or one of the very last ships to leave Italy\nfor the United States.",

        "A: No, no. I wa \u2014I was too busy exploring the ship and so on. I mean, I was the \u2014 I\nwas rather inquisitive and there was \u2014 there was too much to be \u2014 to be explored, too\nmany things to be done, and so on.",

        "A: You mean at the very beginning?",
        "A: No \u2014 yeah \u2014 no, I think at that point they had cut their \u2014 they \u2014 they had\nemotionally cut their ties with Germany, with \u2014 you know, completely. I mean, they\n\u2014 they did not pine for the old country, let\u2019s put it this way. No, they \u2014 they were\nready to make the change and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were ready.",
        "A: I think it probably was the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island or whatever. But \u2014\nand then of course it did \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was all a \u2014a-\u2014 sort of a blur at that point. Of\ncourse, we were met by all our relatives, who in the meantime had gotten together in\nNew York. They als \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Well, it must have been around the 27\", 28\" of May. And they met us, and then\nwe moved in with one of my uncles and aunts \u2014 one of my uncle and aunt, who they\nhad come to the U.S. earlier, and that\u2019s where we went first of all.",
        "A: In the \u2014 in New York City, in the Bronx. Very much in the Bronx, yes. And then\nit was a matter, of course, getting acclimated, or getting acclimated and getting used\nto this city. I mean, you have to keep in mind, Freiburg is a sm \u2014 1s a town,\nLoerrach is a small town. The places I was in Switzerland were tiny villages, and\nthen you had New York. So it wa \u2014 it was \u2014 it\u2019s a shock to the system, but not a\nnegative one, it\u2019s just a plain shock.",
        "A: Yes and no. I did try out a new word on one of my cousins, took me down to the\nstreet and I can\u2019t recall what it was, we met some kids down on the street in front of\nthe house, in front of the apartment building, and I tried out another word, and that\u2019s\nwhen I discovered that that probably was not the appropriate one, because he just hit\nme in the side of the head. I got a nice big lump on the side of my head. My mother\nalmost fainted when she saw it. It looked a lot \u2014 I\u2019m sure it looked a lot worse than it\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas. But anyhow it \u2014 he taught me very quickly that words and language, necessarily\n\u2014 just because you know the word does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s appropriate.\nThen of course, I think we stayed there about two weeks and then something\nhappened to me that was probably of great value to me. I had another uncle and aunt\n\u2014an aunt. She had come to the United States already in the 20s, so they both had\ncome to the States in the 20s. And they were great outdoors people, they loved\nhiking. And they took me, within about two weeks of arriving in the States, they\ntook me out for a two week hike in the mountains, in the Adirondacks or someplace,\nand told everybody, or every one of their friends to talk only English to me. So this\nwas what we would today call deep immersion, and it was great because after two\nweeks I had a fairly decent command of the language. That \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it was\n\u2014 it was a little rough at the time, because you get frustrated in going through it, but\nin retrospect, or even at that point, I mean, immediately afterwards, or even at the\ntime, you recognize that this is the way to go. And then things happened fairly\nquickly after the \u2014 went in fairly rapid succession. I remember my mother went to\nwork in one of the New York sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where\none of my aunts worked, and she \u2014 that was her first job. That\u2019s one the real, I\nwouldn\u2019t say untold stories, but it\u2019s one of the things that I must say we have not\ngiven quite enough recognition to it, although I\u2019m sure it happens even today that\nsome of these people make these changes and they\u2019re tremendous. I mean, adapted in\nNovember 18, 1997\nways that is unimaginable perhaps to us today. Although I\u2019m sure that a lot of ref \u2014\nother refugees, refugees today, who may be doing the same thing I do. Anyhow, my\nmother went to \u2014 did this \u2014 did \u2014 became a sewing machine operator. And then we\nmoved to Long Branch, New Jersey, where I went to school, and my mother and\nfather worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family, with a New\nYork lawyer. And, now, it was amazing that my mother could do it, but the fact that\nmy father suddenly became a sort of handymaid \u2014 handyman-chauffeur and jack-of-\nall-trades was also quite amazing. And we stayed there, I remember I went to school\nthere. I \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean \u2014",
        "A: Well, well, no. One reason of course was when you enter a school at the middle of\nthe year and so on, and most of these schools, there are already groups and cliques,\nyou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re pretty well on your own. Kids don\u2019t really take terribly much notice\nof you, unless you want to be noticed.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, at that point I certainly did. I was an avid newspaper reader,\nlistening to the radio and so on. Beside going to school, I worked. I became a \u2014\nsetting up pins in a bowling alley. Those were the days before the automatic\nNovember 18, 1997\npinsetters. Broke a finger in the process, you catch it between two bowling balls. It\nwas a fairly dangerous sport. I worked on the beach in Long Branch, dishing out ice\ncream during the summer. That sort of thing. And then my parents, I think this\nfamily no longer could afford a couple \u2014 he \u2014 they were \u2014 he had once run as ri \u2014\ncongressman in a \u2014 for congress in a heavily democratic district in New York \u2014 of\ncourse, he was a republican, so he only ran, he never did get \u2014 he didn\u2019t get elected.\nHe was \u2014 they were \u2014 seemed to be very nice people. And at that point my parents\nthen went and went to a training school, run by either the Joint or somebody like\nthat, and they became farmers. They became in poultry farming. Now this wasn\u2019t\nquite as wi \u2014 far removed as being a butler and a handyman, because my parents, the\ntown they had come from, the parents, the \u2014 their parents were involved in \u2014 in cattle\ndealing and so on. So it was a farm community. And lo and behold, after they \u2014 they\ndid this and I think they went through training, there was a training unit near\n[indecipherable] New Jersey, and \u2014 or Bound Brook, New Jersey. And after that,\nthey \u2014 with the aid of \u2014 of the Joint, they bought a poultry farm in a place, in\nCranberry, New Jersey, which is next to Hightstown, which is near Princeton.\nAnd that was in 19 \u2014 that must have been in 19 early \u201840 \u2014I guess late \u201840 \u2014 middle\n\u00b041. And they then \u2014 I went to school there, and they had the poultry farm there. I\nwent to Hightstown first \u2014 well, now I actually \u2014 I guess I went to Hightstown\nHigh. Must have been in the fall of 19 \u2014 hm. No, we \u2014 yeah, must have been in\nNovember 18, 1997\nspring of 1941, because we were already there when the war broke out. Well, it \u2014\ncertainly in \u201941. I went to high school there, had a \u2014 you know, I was \u2014 I was a new\nkid in town, it was pleasant enough. I went to Hightstown High. Had no untoward\nexperiences there except apparently the English teacher told another class that she\ndidn\u2019t believe what I was saying about having left Germany in 1940, because my\nEnglish was too good. And we were then there in June of \u2014 I remember in June of\n1941 when the war broke out with the Russians. The German-Russian was broke out.\nI believe that\u2019s where we were. Anyhow, in 19 \u2014 some time in 1941 because I do\nremember distinctly where I was on Pearl Harbor Day. And my folks then ran this\nfarm, which at that time \u2014 this was the days before the cholesterol scare, and reduced\nmeat production, so the egg business became a very \u2014 quite a good one.",
        "A: Oh no, I\u2014I did work on the farm.",
        "A: No. At that point we really had \u2014 no, we were very fortunate. We had no close\nfamily in Europe any more. We were basically the last ones to get out. I mean, there\nwere obviously family and acquaintances, but no close family, and there was no\ncontact with anybody any more, but \u2014",
        "A: No, I actually had two years of high school. I \u2014 til 1943. At that point my father\nprevailed upon the local draft board not to draft me because I was needed for farm\nwork. And before too long I decided I looked like I was gonna miss the war, which I\ndid not want to miss. And I went to the draft board and says, I\u2019m ready. And actually\nthen was called up and went \u2014 went off in \u2014 in middle of 1944. Joined the briga \u2014\njoined the army, basic training, Camp Blanding, Florida.",
        "A: No, I got my citizenship I think in Jacksonville, Florida while in the army, while\nin basic training. It was a \u2014 a-any day that you could get out of basic training was a\nday won. So, you know, it was great becoming an American citizen, it was equally\ngreat to get out of one day of basic training.",
        "A: Oh, it felt great, it felt absolutely great. I later on wore it back to \u2014 even though it\n\u2014 well, we\u2019ll get to that later, but anyhow I \u2014 I did wear it back to Loerrach, in the \u2014\neven though that was in the French zone. I wore it in Switzerland. Oh yes, it was \u2014 it\nwas great.",
        "A: Well, then I c-completed basic training, I was supposed to go out and suddenly\nthe army just ad \u2014 I was asked, just as we were shipping out to basic training, I was\nNovember 18, 1997\na-a-asked where my second pair of glasses were. Well, the army had issued me one\npair, but I had never gotten a second pair. And I was heartbroken to find that I could\nnot ship out with \u2014 with the people I trained with. They me \u2014 they were sent overseas\nand before long they were caught in the Battle of the Bulge. I, on the other hand,\nstayed around for two more weeks. At that time they didn\u2019t have this one hour\neyeglass service, otherwise I would have also been probably in the Battle of the\nBulge. And I got, about two weeks later, I \u2014 my second pair of metal rimmed glasses,\nand I was off to Italy, and became a member of the 10\" Mountain Division. And as I\nsay, joined the 10\" Mountain Division and was in the 87\" regiment, E company, and\nsaw combat with them in northern Italy.",
        "A: Yes, yes. [indecipherable] We ended up, after the war, or when the war was\nover, we were in northern Italy. We were in \u2014 on Lake Garda when the war was\nover. And about five days later, while sort of trying to recuperate from what had\nbeen a fairly strenuous few weeks, I got orders to go down the Fifth Army\nheadquarters, where I became an interpreter.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, my experience in combat was different because we had a crazy command \u2014\nbattalion commander, who decided that patrols going out at night would be greatly\nenhanced by having a German speaker with them. And regrettably, we only had two\nmen in the battalion who spoke good German. So either he or \u2014 or I went out in most\npatrols at night. I mean, I \u2014 I would go out and patrol with our own comp \u2014 for \u2014 for\nme \u2014 patrol for my own company, and for other companies. And then he had an\naccident and shot himself, or shot ca \u2014 shot himself through the hand, so then there\nwas one of us. So I never needed to use \u2014 or never did use my German in patrol at\nnight. But the experience, yes, I had a few interesting incidents. I mean, one\nparticular thing, we were the first unit to cross the Po River in northern Italy and\nmarching along either side of the road with the \u2014 1n \u2014 1n \u2014 sort of in a ditch, and I was\nat the head. I must say, I didn\u2019t volunteer for these things, I usually was volunteered.\nAnd a bicycle rider came down the middle of the street, uniform, and coming\ntowards us. And he came and came bef \u2014 I thought somebody was going to shoot the\npoor guy, because he obviously didn\u2019t know what was going on. And finally I\njumped out of the ditch and went up and in my best German stopped him. And he\nstarted arguing with me in German because the 10\" Mountain uniforms were very\nmuch like German parachuter uniforms, and he thought he had encountered another\namer \u2014 German unit, and he was telling me that he had a very important message for\nthe commanding general. Well, we were obviously very interested in that. And \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. And so we \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, there were some incidents like\nthat, but \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: I-",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, I \u2014 I ended up with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the\ninfantryman\u2019s badge, and all this sort of thing. Which was actually the nicest thing\nyou could get in the U.S. Army, in \u2014 if you had to be in combat, because it meant 10\ndollars a month more in your pay.",
        "A: Did I that I know of? You know, war very frequently is, except for hand to hand\ncombat, which we did not get into, war is very impersonal. So to answer your\nquestion, I don\u2019t know. But that wouldn\u2019t have bothered me one iota. But no, we\nthen, as I say, after the war was over, I got transferred to \u2014 I was told to go on detail\nto Fifth Army headquarters and there I became the \u2014 one of the interpreters in Mark\nClark \u2014 General Mark Clark\u2019s staff.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 this was on \u2014 in Gardone Riviera, right on Lake Garda, one of these\ngreat big magnificent hotels. Three months of it, a real tough life. And they had a\nGerman general staff unit there. The Colonel Schweinitz was in charge. This was a\nGerman unit that was responsible for getting the Germans out of the northern Italian\nAlps to surrender, and to organize it. And so they had \u2014 they had a staff there, and I\nwas basically the interpreter between the Americans and the Germans there.\nAmerican units and German units.",
        "A: Yeah, I was \u2014",
        "A: No, I was \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was translating actually. I was \u2014 I was interpreting between them and\nyou know, they\u2019re pretty high level in the German army, and they often wanted to\nknow why I spoke such good German. I made absolutely no secret of it, and it was\nan interesting sp \u2014 probably the funniest experience there was, sitting once in the car\nbetween two \u2014 two generals, and at that time I\u2019m [indecipherable] I mean, I had\nbeen promoted at that point to private first class. And I suddenly burst out laughing.\nNow, one doesn\u2019t do that when one is a PFC between two generals, but I \u2014 I burst\nout laughing, and they both wanted to know why. And I said, well, it\u2019s a pretty silly\nNovember 18, 1997\n\u2014 funny situation, because the one man on my left was the German chief cha \u2014 chief\nchaplain of the German army in Italy, and the guy on the right was the chief chaplain\nof the American army. And I basically said, you know, it\u2019s kind of [indecipherable]\nto have a little Jew in between you, and you need me to get together. So that was one\nof the more \u2014 that was \u2014 that happened during that period. My German was good, but\nit was certainly not technically all that great. It was, you know, 15 year old boy\u2019s\nGerman. But it got me into some interesting places like the German underground\ncommunications facilities in Verona, where all the German telephone lines and so\non came together. Then one side you had the chief American engineers and the\nGerman engineers and I was in between. Fortunately, when it came to technical\nterms they were able to \u2014 to communicate without me. I sort of filled in the gaps in\nbetween. But I was there for three months, and then was transferred to a \u2014 to\nsomething called USDIC, United States Detailed Interrogation Center. This was a \u2014\nan interrogation group, which at that point was located in Verona, Italy, and from\nItaly we then transferred and we moved to Austria, town like \u2014 the name of\nGmunden in upper Austria, where we set up an interrogation center. And most\neverybody in that unit spoke German, or a great many spoke German. And \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. I mean, the United States didn\u2019t have all that many people at that\npoint who were pro \u2014 sufficiently proficient in English and German, and knew\nNovember 18, 1997\nsomething about German army, you know, ger \u2014 you know. And the USDIC in\nGmunden was set up to this interrogation center, held VIP or medium VIP prisoners\nfor interrogation. They were interrogated there, and we had a large number of cells.\nAnd I guess I\u2019m not revealing any mo \u2014 anything that\u2019s secret any more, but at that\npoint, we had concealed microphones built into the individual cells, and I spent most\nof my time sitting with earphones, listening to these conversations, or recording\nthem. Some of them were \u2014 some of them were quite interesting. And so I spent \u2014\nthat started about July 1940 \u2014 or must have been August, I guess, 1945, so \u2014 in\nAustria.",
        "A: Well, it got pretty crude when you have two female German youth leaders talking\nabout their sex life, for instance, or \u2014 all sorts of things.",
        "A: No, at this point they didn\u2019t. Not \u2014 not really. There was nothing \u2014 it was basically\nmaterial that you wanted to give \u2014 provide to the interrogators, to probe, and so on.",
        "A: Well, at that point of course, we had \u2014 near where we were, we had Ebensee, the\ncamp. Mauthausen was not too far away. Oh, I guess, what can you describe it?\nNovember 18, 1997\nAnger, frustration, rage, you name it. I must say that this \u2014 I had great problems as\nfar as the Austrian concerned. In my book I once wrote that what took Germans six\nyear \u2014 t-t-took six years to establish certain measures against the Jews, the Austrians\nwere able to do in six weeks. And it was \u2014 w-we got \u2014 the whole unit, I would say,\ngot pretty sick and tired of being told how glad they were to see us, and how they\nhad suffered under the Germans, and so on.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: In fact, we had a theater in town, in Gmunden, which was alternately being used\nby the Austrian population, a movie theater, and also for plays, and as a movie house\nfor the American troops, the 10\" Armored Division was in the area. And we finally\nin \u2014 in \u2014in\u2014in the USDIC we finally got sick and tired of being told of how the\nAustrians had suffered, that we found a newsreel of Germans \u2014 troops marching into\nGmunden, and we told the projectionist to play it in connection, without any\ncomment, in connection with the next time he was \u2014 had a movie showing for the\nlocal audience. And it was interesting, it \u2014 word got around town very, very quickly,\nand we didn\u2019t hear this for quite awhile any more.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I stayed there until December 1945. At that time I got, on two days\u2019 notice I\nwas told I could go back to the U.S. on R and R, rest and recuperation. I had the\nrequisite number of points. You \u2014 you were given points by \u2014 for \u2014 for overseas duty\nand combat and so on, and they were taking people back to the States for rest and\nrecuperation. So off I went and came back to the States, surprised my folks, and then\nwent back. In the meantime I had decided I wanted to go to work at one of the war\ncrimes trials. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, I decided it would be a fairly interesting closure. I mean, it would be an\ninteresting experience. And it would be the sort of thing I wanted to do. Now, I did\nha \u2014 well, I -",
        "A: I would say both. It was both. But when I got to the States, and I remember I got\nback to Fort Dix, ready to get on the next ship to go back overseas, I was told, I\u2019m\nsorry, you will re \u2014 you can\u2019t go back overseas. Why not? He says, well, the \u2014 with\nthe war over in the Far East, and all this sort of thing, the only way you can go back\noverseas 1s 1f you re-enlist. Otherwise, you can\u2019t go back. Well, I wanted to go back\npretty badly, I wanted to go back to my unit. And so I did something in a moment of\nNovember 18, 1997\nyouthful exuberance, I re-enlisted, and signed up, and they changed the orders and\nthey \u2014 I said, you \u2014 they \u2014 go back. And I went back, came back overseas. Got to\nCherbourg, and there they had me going to some other unit in northern Germany or\nsomeplace, and I screamed and yelled as much as a \u2014 at that point I\u2019'd been promoted\nto corporal \u2014 as much a corporal can do. And they said all right, they finally \u2014 I\nremember, I think I had to change a couple hundred orders, because they had about a\nhundred, couple hundred people on \u2014 on these orders to a certain place, and I had to\ngo through each and every one of them and rule out my name; they let me do that.\nAnd so they sent me back, they said fine, you can go back to your unit in Austria.\nAnd I got to Paris and in Paris I stayed at the enlisted men\u2019s billets in Paris, and\nthis was \u2014 the gods really took kindly to me because when I was \u2014 I stayed there for\ntwo days, and I was then ready to go back to Austria. I tried to get my duffel bag,\nand lo and behold, it had been stolen. Now this wouldn\u2019t normally be a tragedy\nexcept all my personnel papers were in there. So I got some temporary papers, went\nback to Austria and of course I forgot to tell them that I had re-enlisted. So I guess\nI\u2019m a fugitive from \u2014 from \u2014 from military justice. And got back to \u2014 to Austria,\nstayed there until \u2014 in the meantime I \u2014 I traveled to both Dachau and to\nNuremberg.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh no, oh no, I had \u2014 my first time back in Germany was in \u2014 when I was still in\n\u2014I guess probably when I was in Verona, so it must have been about August. I\ntraveled to Germany, and | traveled to Switzerland in uniform. At that point you\ncould go to Switzerland. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I sort of strutted around. I went back to Germany, to my old haunts, met a\nfew people who knew me. Noticed that there were a lot of people behind curtains\nlooking at this weird American walking in the street. Keep in mind you\u2019re in the fr \u2014\nI\u2019m \u2014 I was in the French zone, I did not look like a French soldier. Wandered\naround, went to Breisach where my parents had lived and were born, and went to\nFreiburg. Met \u2014 as I say, met some people. And then \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah \u2014 well, you mean, before?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, especially in Breisach and in \u2014 in \u2014 in Loerrach, oh yes. These\nwere people who knew me.",
        "A: Oh yeah, those people were. The others stayed out of \u2014 I assume stayed out of the\nway because I didn\u2019t run into any of the others. The one person I looked for, I\ncouldn\u2019t find.",
        "A: Oh heavens no, I wa \u2014 I felt like a conquering hero. No, I felt anything but.",
        "A: Yes, very much so. About 150 percent. Yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s pretty heady for a 20 year\nold, you know, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 when a want \u2014 when you sort of run at age 15 and come\nback as \u2014 as a member of \u2014 of \u2014 of a victorious army, oh yeah, it feels very good.",
        "A: No, I went to \u2014 because the set of trials were coming up there. And I went there\nand then I decided I would rather go to Nuremberg.",
        "A: Well, it seemed like the more interesting, more \u2014 historically more interesting sort\nof thing to do.",
        "A: Yes, well, painful n \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know whether you would call it painful, it was\n\u2014 it was emotionally wrenching, but not \u2014 you know. But anyhow, I went back to my\nunit, arranged to get my army discharge in Vienna, and off I went to Nuremberg.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Yep. I left the army in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Vienna and \u2014 in May of 1946, moved to\nNuremberg as a civilian.",
        "A: Well, you know, you were assigned billets, you were \u2014 they had previously gi \u2014\ntested me, they had decided that I probably wouldn\u2019t make a terribly good \u2014 which I\nagreed with \u2014 a terribly good court interpreter, or an interpreter in the court, but they\ndid decide to use me as an interpreter where you had consecutive interpretation, and I\nbasically spent all my time either as a translator, which means on written documents,\nor as an interpreter working \u2014 well, here I should digress. The Nuremberg Trials\nactually had 22 main defendants, but in addition to that, it had seven organizations\nwhich were on trial. Things like the SA, the SS, the general staff, the Reich\u2019s\ncabinet. The idea being that if the members of the organization, if the organization\nwere declared as guilty of war crimes, then members above a certain level, or maybe\nat any level, would automatically be considered as \u2014 as guilty. And now, since\nhowever there were too many people that either wanted to testify, or provide\naffidavits, or statements in connection with these things, separate hearings were held,\nin a separate room, before a public, but they were done in German and English. And\nso you had, there you had, before a commissioner, the chief commissioner was an\nEnglishman who later on met an untimely death as being a \u2014 he was a secretary for\nNovember 18, 1997\nnorthern Ireland in the British cabinet, and his car bl \u2014 got blown up. And so you\nhad th-the \u2014 you had four, actually four commissioners; you had an American, you\nhad a Britisher, you had a Frenchman and you had a Russian. But all the discussions,\nall the ti \u2014 the \u2014 the testimony was in English and German, and instead of having\nimmediate translation, simultaneous translation, you had consecutive. But you had\nonly one interpreter, so you \u2014 you had one person doing English to German, ger \u2014\nand German English.",
        "A: No, this was part of the first, main trial, where you for instance had \u2014 and you had\nactually then, decisions of guilt and innocence of these various organizations, like the\nGerman general staff, and by virtue of sort of concentrating, these were the people\nthat were on \u2014 were being heard at that point. I spent much of my time working with\nwitnesses for the German general staff. People like von Rundstedt, Kesselring,\nManstein, etcetera. And \u2014",
        "A: No, this was one of the nice things in this, because A, the interpreter sat right next\nto the witness. These were not defendants, the main defendants never came. These\nwere people that testified. Some of them were subject later on to subsequent trials.\nAnd others then were, for instance, [indecipherable] Dieter Wisliceny, who was \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997\nwas what\u2019s his name\u2019s deputy. Heydrich. No, not Heydrich, Eichmann\u2019s deputy\nwas one of the people that testified, and he later on was sent off to Poland, where he\nwas executed. One of the nice things was that the interpreter sat right next to the\nwitness, you weren\u2019t separated by a glass wall. There was no microphone or\nanything like this, and you had \u2014 could have conversations with him during the\nbreak. In addition to that, your work as a \u2014 an interpreter usually, maximally you\ncould do this for \u2014 it was for about an hour and a half. It was fairly strenuous. And\nyou would sit \u2014 either you\u2019d sit in the room itself, in the courtroom, or you would sit\nin a waiting room, and that\u2019s where, usually, the next witness was waiting with a\nguard. And so you could sit there and talk and \u2014 yeah, had some interesting\nconversations. I had \u2014 Kesselring once asked me, Field Marshall Kesselring, he and\nI, we \u2014 we sat there waiting to go \u2014 go onstage, and he wanted to know where I \u2014\nwell, first \u2014 first we \u2014 where I'd been, and I\u2019d been, of course, in Italy, and he had\nbeen in Italy. Now, slightly different positions obviously, but we discussed military\nstrategy in Italy to the extent that I was able to. He then wanted to know where I\u2019d\nlearned my German, and I told him. And his reaction was, well, that must be a great\nsatisfaction for you to be here. And I said, it certainly is, Field Marshall. So, you\nknow, some of these \u2014 Rundstedt once talked \u2014 gave his testimony, and he talked\nfor \u2014 we had \u2014 we had told him, look, I can take about four minutes, five minutes\nmaximum, but after that I can\u2019t do any more. And so he made a 10 minute speech,\nNovember 18, 1997\nand then turned to me, and I sort of shrugged my shoulders. And I turned to the\njudge, who in turn said, well, we can have the court reporter read it off, and then\nwe'll translate it from that. The court reporter said, I couldn\u2019t follow him either, I\nwas hoping the interpreter could. So we all turned back to Field Marshall Rundstedt,\nwho then said \u2014 gave the exact same speech, broken into two parts. It was amazing.\nThis man \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say it was rehearsed, but he gave exactly the\nsame thing all over again. So anyhow, so it was \u2014 there were some interesting\nexperiences, the \u2014 the last head of the SA gave testimony about Crystal Night. And\nactually, I prefer to call 1t pogrom of 1938. And he was telling how the SA really was\na, more or less a social organization whose main task was to protect Jewish lives and\nproperty during \u2014 during this period, during Crystal Night.",

And I had to get a deposition\nfrom two people. One was General Stiilpnagel, who was the commander in Paris\nfrom 1940 to 1942. He \u2014 there were two Stulpnagel gen-generals, Sttilpnagel; one\nof them was involved in the \u2014 the attack on Hitler, this was not the one. And I think\nthe French eventually probably even let him go. The other was hama \u2014 Helmut\nKnochen, head of the SD, who was Klaus Barbie\u2019s boss; probably one of the most\nhated men in France; the man who implemented the Night and Fog decree, etcetera.\nNow I saw Helmut Knochen before that, in Nuremberg, and in Nuremberg it was\nvery interesting because in Nuremberg the French prosecutor had a number of\nquestions to ask him. And he would ask Knochen and Knochen, who, by the way,\nNovember 18, 1997\nhad it \u2014 a PhD in linguistics, would deny that he ever heard of this, and the French\nprosecutor, man by the name of Monterey(ph) would pick up a piece of paper and\nsay well, is this your signature or not, and the man would say yes. And he\u2019d ask him\nanother question, Knochen would deny it, Monterey(ph) would hand him a\ndocument, says, is this your pre \u2014 piece the \u2014 is this your signature? Yes. Well, after\nthat it was almost like Pavlov\u2019s dog, because all that Monterey(ph) had to do 1s pick\nup a piece of paper and Knochen would admit everything. Well, when I got to Paris,\nhere was, in Cherche-Midi prison \u2014 Cherche-Midi Prison looks something like a \u2014\nwe sort of imagined French prisons to look in the 18\" century. You \u2014 when you\nknocked on the gate, somebody would come with a key about a foot long, and there\nwasn\u2019t very much oil in the lock, and they would open it, and then you\u2019d walk in,\nand then there\u2019s a room full of French prison guards and one of \u2014 couple of them\nwere getting haircuts, in another part they were \u2014 some were playing cards. And so\nyou finally get to this guy, you get to the prosecutor\u2019s office, and they would bring in\nHelmut Knochen. This was in 1946. Well, they\u2019d given helm \u2014 it was cold, it was\nDecember. Helmut \u2014 they had given Helmut Knochen \u2014 they must have given him\none shaving \u2014 one razor blade a month there, because he had a stubble beard. He had\na French army overcoat that was about four sizes too big. He looked pretty sad at that\nstage of the game, let me put it this way. He did not look like the sort of Aryan\nNovember 18, 1997\nsuperman, you know. So now many of the \u2014 you \u2014 you could \u2014 you could \u2014 you had\nto maintain your distance.",

I mean, there\u2019s the \u2014 the register, I remember distinctly the\nregister from a \u2014 one of the \u2014 the German quote, hospitals, unquote, which were \u2014\nwere the mentally deficient or mentally ill people were killed, and I remember seeing\nthe death register. This was in the case of the \u2014 I think it was the justice trial, where\nthe head \u2014 at the top of the page 1t would list the name, and it would list the time of\ndeath, and then it would list the place of death, and the cause of death. And then\nunder that you had a list of maybe 30 - 40 names, however long the register was, and\nditto marks under everything else. So everybody died at the same time, of the same\nheart failure.",
        "A: I don\u2019t re \u2014\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember which \u2014 which institution there was, but it was one of those\nthings that, you know, they \u2014 they had to fill out a death register, and this was the\nway to do it. I mean, Germans were very precise and practical. Law requirement was\nto have a registry. And they had one, but they didn\u2019t want to spend all that much\ntrouble, to invent a new cause of death for each case, so they make ditto marks. They\ngave the name and then a ditto mark under it. This is where, as I say, so many of the\n\u2014 some devastating materials of that type were found. Orders which were signed by\nofficials. One of the nice things the Germans did as far as the prosecution was\nconcerned, was that every leading official had his own \u2014 had \u2014 had an initial. Well,\nthose are very frequently difficult to decipher. But what was nice, they all used\ndifferent colors. So if you saw a blue initial, let\u2019s say, in the \u2014 in the Ministry of\nJustice, you know exactly who saw it, and if you saw a red one, you know who saw\nit. So it wasn\u2019t just you \u2014 you could identify the individual, and we\u2019re talking here at\nthe top level obviously, at the sub-muinistry level, and the sub-minister level. And this\nis where, in going through the Ministry of Justice files, I had an interesting\nexperience, because having lived through Kristallnacht, I decided this was a good\ntime to look at some of the files having to do with Crystal Night. And the document\ncenter had a lot of German employees, who we would indicate from registers what\ndocuments we wanted, or what folders we \u2014 what folders we wanted, and they would\nNovember 18, 1997\nbring it. And one day this gentleman brought me some files, I started getting some\nfiles having to do with \u2014 with Herschel Grynszpan and the \u2014 the Crystal Night\nevents and afterwards. And he said to me, I see you\u2019re interested in the events in\nParis in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was. And at that point I had in front of me a\n\u2014 the future \u2014 the trial schedule. The Germans had planned to put on trial Herschel\nGrynszpan after he had been turned over to the German authorities in 1941, after the\nfall of France. And two of the witnesses were going to be members of the germ \u2014 the\nembassy staff in Paris, namely \u2014 I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at\nthe front gate when he came in, when Grynszpan came in to \u2014 and the other was the\nclerk at the information desk who, in fact, took Herschel Grynszpan to see vom\nRath, the German third secretary who then \u2014 and he subsequently went and shot him.\nAnd this, of course triggered, or was used as an excuse for the events of Crystal\nNight. And I \u2014 the trial preparation called for these two clerks to testify. I asked them\nwhether he knew Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph), clerk so and so, and he says yes, I knew him\nquite well. I said, well, what about Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph) or clerk Nagorka? He was\nthe man who \u2014 to whom Herschel Grynszpan said whom he wanted to see. This\nwas a fairly important bit of evidence because of some of the \u2014 th-the arguments\nbeing made whether or not vom Rath was the actual intended victim, or the\naccidental victim. And the clerk said well nag \u2014 clerk Nagorka, that\u2019s me. So that\nwas a rather startling bit of information, but anyhow, he provided me the information\nNovember 18, 1997\nthat I wanted. And this was a \u2014 basically the beginning of the \u2014 the beginning of my\nresearch for a book which I finally finished about 40 years later.",
        "A: Well, he confirmed \u2014 well, let \u2014 let me go back. The question was, did \u2014 at that\npoint Grynszpan was asking \u2014 this was in 1942, after he had turned over to the\nGermans of \u201941, he claimed that he shot vom Rath for personal reasons. And so the\nquestion was, the key question was, did Herschel Grynszpan ask for vom Rath in\nperson, or did he just ask for a German clerk \u2014 a German officer. And the answer,\naccording to Nagorka was, he asked to see an embassy official. And this was a key\nbit of evidence.",
        "A: Well, we spend all the time going through documents, every now and then finding\nsomething of interest, identifying, writing abstracts, and sending them on to \u2014 to\nNuremberg. The \u2014 some of them were \u2014 at that point in Nuremberg, the medical\ntrial was going on, but subsequ \u2014 they were looking for materials for subsequent\ntrials, the Ministry of Justice, and various other ministries. And you just sort of \u2014\neither you were told, or you were given advice where to look, or you sort of followed\na hunch, or you followed something, so \u2014 something followed a trail which suddenly\nNovember 18, 1997\nopened up. By far and away the mo \u2014 well, almost the most interesting or\ncomprehensive trail led to the Reich\u2019s Chancellery, Hitler\u2019s office. Because every\ntime one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight,\nthey would send an \u2014 a copy to Hitler\u2019s Secretary of the Chancellery. So there you\nwould have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back. I mean,\nwhen a peop \u2014 person like the Minister of Post got mad \u2014 or the Minister of\nAgriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him \u2014 accused him of\nhaving an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the\nMinistry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty\nletter, and also send a copy to the chancellery. So that \u2014 there was a lot of\ninformation obtainable there. But mainly, you would stumble across something. Or,\nthey would \u2014 somebody would identify a certain event, and he \u2014 you would dig into\nit.",

        "A: Yeah. Yes, personal camera. Came up, had qui \u2014 made quite a few photographs.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "A: Well, you saw them in the context that they were \u2014 were there. I would say for the\nmost part they were certainly not big in life any more. I mean, you knew that they\nwere prisoners, you know they were on trial for their life. I would say the only one\nNovember 18, 1997\nwho \u2014 whom you might \u2014 not larger than life, but \u2014 was Goering, who \u2014 whose\npresence was \u2014 was \u2014 he wa \u2014 he was an imposing presence, let\u2019s put it this way.",
        "A: Too bad. I felt \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that he cheated the \u2014 the hangman. No, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it was not anything \u2014 it\nwas \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I sort of felt sorry for the prison staff, who \u2014 obviously somebody\u2019s \u2014\nsomebody was going to be blamed for it. No, not \u2014 no \u2014 I mean, how he went really\nwasn\u2019t all that important to me.",
        "A: Well, he was a lot closer the second time, because the first time, obviously he had\nno \u2014 I mean, I wasn\u2019t looking for trouble. I just saw him out of the \u2014 out \u2014 looking\nout of the apartment. And he was down at that \u2014 must have been about 1937 - \u201938. At\nthat time he was head \u2014 head of the Hitler youth. He subsequently then became\nGauleiter of Vienna, and so on, and it was in that capacity that he ended up in \u2014 in\nNuremberg and got 20 years. He was a lot closer then.",
        "A: Well, I stayed in Berlin until about March, I guess, March or April 1947, and then\ndecided it was go \u2014 time to go back, to quit.",
        "A: Well, I decided I couldn\u2019t quite go on having only two years of high school, it\nwas time to go back to school. And of course, I came back about the time a great\nmany G.I.s came back, or were back, and had decided with the \u2014 thanks to the G.I.\nbill. And so there was a great deal of competition for places in school, and American\ncolleges, which of course the attendance exploded as a result of that. But I\u2014 so I \u2014 as\nI say, ninetee \u2014 early 1947, I figured I better go back, finish high school. Well, do\nsomething. And \u2014",
        "A: No, I had two years of high school, that was it. And then I applied to a couple of\nplaces, and I remember I applied to Rutgers University, and \u2014 but the one that I\napplied, that I finally went to, was the school which would admit me without\nfinishing high school; they didn\u2019t care, and that was the University of Chicago. So in\nfall of 1947, thanks to the G.I. bill, because without it I certainly would \u2014 oh, I\u2019m\ncertainly would have gone to Rutgers, which was out of state college or university; I\nwas off to Chicago. And spent three years there.",
        "A: Well, in Chicago, the old days of Robert Maynard Hutchins, you didn\u2019t \u2014 they\ntold you what you were going to study, you didn\u2019t tell them. It wa \u2014 it was an\ninteresting situation. They \u2014 you took 28 ou \u2014 battery of 28 hours of tests, and then\nthey said here are the courses you have to take, and when you finish these courses\nsatisfactory, you get a B.A. degree. And I did, and in 1949, I got my B.A. Obviously\nI picked up something in between. Then spent a year taking \u2014 well, let\u2019s see, I spent\none semester, after finishing the college of the University of Chicago, I spent one\nsemester in the School of Social Service Administration, and decided that that was\nnot the appropriate career for me. I had nothing against the School of Social Service\nAdministration, I just couldn\u2019t quite see myself working with some of the people that\nwere taking courses with me, and then switched back to political science, until the\nend of 1949 \u2014 \u00b047? No, no, 1950. And in 1950 then decided to go to Stanford\nUniversity in order to \u2014 I wanted to \u2014 to do some research on the Grynszpan case\nand the Hoover Library of War and Peace had the best materials. So I went out there,\nand then spent a year there gradu \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, I was \u2014 well, I got a second B.A. there. Stanford University looked at\nmy \u2014 the fact that it took me two years in Chicago to get a B.A., they were horrified\nenough that I didn\u2019t finish high school. But the fact that I only spent two years\nNovember 18, 1997\ngetting my B.A., and to Stanford, in order \u2014 the way to get your B.A. is to be in\nschool for four years. So I got my second B.A. there, in political science.",
        "A: Well, then something happened which \u2014 you know, you hear these stories only in\nAmerica, something that I still consider amazing, and which I tell some of my f\u2014\nmy \u2014 especially my European acquaintances about. The State Department put out a\ncall to all the colleges and universities for a special intern program. Every school in\nthe country was invited to provi \u2014 to designate somebody for an intern program \u2014 or\nnominate somebody. And eventually, in early \u2014 you'll have to pass something called\na JMA, which was a \u2014 this was during the time of the Korean War, there was a\nfreeze on federal hiring, except if you passed this exam. And you \u2014 the prerequisite\nwas passing the JMA. Well, to make a long story short, out of the 22 people picked\nby the State Department, I was one of them, from Stanford. And I still find this\namazing, because there was certainly no need for this \u2014 the government agency at\nthat point to pick somebody who\u2019d been in the country only 10 years. It was ju \u2014I\njust found it ab-absolutely amazing, because it was a special program. And so we\ncame together, there were 22 of us from all over the United States. And that\u2019s how I\nthen entered my first job, State Department.\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: Oh well, let\u2019s see. After that I joined the Foreign Service. I joined the State\nDepartment in 1951, joined the Foreign Service in 1955 \u2014 four \u2014 54 \u2014 no, *55. 1955\nto 1957, I was assistant cultural officer in Vienna, then back to Washington for two\nyears, 1960 to \u201962. The ama \u2014 new American embassy at Lom\u00e9 Togo. Lom\u00e9 at that\npoint was so new that most of our mail went to Lima, because nobody in the State\nDepartment mailroom really had heard of Lom\u00e9. Then from Lom\u00e9 back to\nWashington for two years. Then to eastern Nigeria for two years, which at that\npoint was on the verge of becoming Biafra, just before the civil war. From there a\nyear to Sierra Leone. You ca \u2014 as you can see, I \u2014 I hit all the beauty sp \u2014 actually\nwe di \u2014 we liked \u2014 we very much liked all of Africa, with the exception of sieral \u2014\nSierra Leone. I guess we got a little satiated at that point. From there, three years to\nTunisia. From Tunisia then a year and a half, almost two years to Bangkok,\nThailand. Now, there was quite a switch. From Bangkok, Thailand onto a year at\nCornell University for a sabbatical, where \u2014 I guess you call it a sabbatical. Then\nback to Washington from 1973 to 1976. And at that point I was sent to \u2014 I was\ndetailed by the State Department to an organization in which the United States at\nthat point was not even a member, namely the International Labor Organization in\nGeneva, Switzerland. We went there for one year and stayed 10, and retired in\n1986.",
        "A: Woop. Well, I got married while \u2014 in my last year in Chicago.",
        "A: Yes, she is from Berlin, and I met her through somebody with whom I\u2019m \u2014 I\nworked in Berlin.",
        "A: Well, it was an interesting case. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t catcha \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 the book,\neventually I named, \u201cThe Day the Holocaust Began,\u201d because I do feel that the\nbeginning of the Holocaust, or \u2014 was with Crystal Night. It was used by the Nazis as\nan excuse. But it was the beginning, it was the first time, really, with a couple of\nminor exceptions of centralized \u2014 centrally directed anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish\nactivities in Germany. And while there were obviously earlier ones, like the boycott\nof nine \u2014 April 1933, the book burning of May 1, 1933, but after that it was really\nthese \u2014 most of the things that happened were locally inspired, or locally activated.\nThis, the events, once they got going, and even though Crystal Night was not\ncentrally directed in the normally accepted term of the word \u2014 the wor \u2014 yeah \u2014\nafterwards, it certainly was, and that was the beginning, to me, of the Holocaust. I \u2014 I\nfound this young man \u2014 the story, of course, is that somebody, his parents \u2014 a young\nPolish Jew, living in Germany, born in Germany. His parents had lived in\nGermany since 1911, walked into \u2014 heard \u2014 heard that his pare \u2014 he was living in\nNovember 18, 1997\nParis, heard that his parents had been shoved over the border into Poland. In \u2014 in\nlate October 1940 \u2014 no, \u201938, they sent him a postcard in Paris, where he was living\nillegally with his uncle. He walked into the German embassy, shot the third\nsecretary. The third secretary, after having what to the ra \u2014 to those of us in the\nforeign service can only call a meteoric rise, within two days he became first\nsecretary. But he died. And that was then the beginning of the events of November\nninth to 10\", the night of the ninth - 10 of November. He was held wi \u2014 in France.\nSubsequently he said he had killed vom Rath because of the postcard he had gotten\nfrom his parents, and so on. He then was subsequently turned over to the Germans.\nThey were going to make a major propaganda trial for \u2014 in which there were two\ndefendants, world jury and in an \u2014 in the form of Herschel Grynszpan, and they\nwere going to try to prove that the shot of Paris 1938 was the same as the shot of\nSarajevo some 20 years earlier, in other words, that they had caused World War II.\nThe Foreign Ministry was behind it, they hav \u2014 had to have some excuse, they were\ndesperately looking for an excuse for the outbreak of World War II.",
        "A: Well, the research of course, I \u2014 I did a lot of it \u2014 I got a lot of it at \u2014 at \u2014 at\nStanford, materials. I got a lot of zer \u2014 not Xerox, Photostat copies of documents in\nBerlin. And then in th \u2014 read an awful lot and research, got a lot of materials; for\ninstance, as an example, the full Goebbels diary was at Stanford, or the \u2014 the\nNovember 18, 1997\nPhotostat of the entire microfilm was \u2014 was at Stanford. Worked there, and over\ntime, eventually actually, later on went to \u2014 met with his \u2014 with vom Rath\u2019s brother,\nwho was a lawyer in Wiesbaden, when we were living in Geneva. Did \u2014 found the\nFrenchman who had done a great deal of work on the same thing, and exchanged\ndocuments with him, and this was basically how it worked. I mean you \u2014 it\u2019s a never\nending thing. And actually I had my first chance to publish my work in 1952 or \u201953,\nwhen somebody in England heard about it, and I was offered that they would\npublish it, and in the State Department, being a very junior officer at that stage of the\ngame, I had to \u2014 at that time it was necessary to submit manuscripts to a review\ncommittee. And after talking to these people, they said send it over, I sent it over to\nthem. I had a document written. And about four weeks, five weeks later I get a call\nback saying this is a very interesting \u2014 we\u2019ve just made a couple of suggestions\nwhere we wouldn\u2019t \u2014 since you\u2019re now a member of the State Department, where it\nwould not be totally appropriate, but we\u2019ve marked the place. Well, the document\ncame back and it weighed about twice as much as it did before it went out because\nthey put paper clips on all those places. Well, they had a paper clip almost on every\nother page. And what had \u2014 had happened was that the French Foreign Minister,\nGeorges Bonnet, at that point was go \u2014 who had been the French Foreign Minister,\nhe was going to testify for the Germans, or at least so the documentation said, was\ngoing to testify in this big trial against Herschel Grynszpan. Well, by this point, mis\nNovember 18, 1997\n\u2014 Georges Bonnet had become \u2014 1950s \u2014 Georges Bonnet had become\n[indecipherable] to Franco-American Friendship Society, and it would just not do,\nsaying that he had collaborated with the Germans. And without it, the story wouldn\u2019t\nhave made quite as much sense. So I put it away and kept it \u2014 kept it packed up for\n35 years.",
        "A: Well, when you \u2014 when you work and you \u2014 the people usually ask you what are\nyou going to do afterwards, you say you\u2019ll write a book. And then when finally it\ncomes you retire, you gotta put up or shut up.",
        "A: Yes, very definitely did. The biggest conclusion \u2014 first of all yes, you obvi \u2014 I\nobviously did a great deal of research into the era, into the life of the Polish Jews in\nGermany. I mean, here\u2019s \u2014 here are \u2014 here are people that came to Germany in\n1911. In 1938 they\u2019re shoved across the border as Poles. You learn about why they\nwere pushed across the border, and here you can attribute that to the actions of the\nPolish government as much as to the German government. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s not too\nwell known, but the fact of the matter 1s, 1t was \u2014 1t was provoked by the Poles. But\nthe biggest thing that I think I learned is that to me Herschel Grynszpan to start\nwith, was an assassin. I don\u2019t like assassins, for any reason, regardless. And I was not\nNovember 18, 1997\nterribly favorably well disposed towards him. I learned two things. One, before his\nprobable death \u2014 in other words, we still don\u2019t know exactly where he died, although\nwe have a pretty good idea \u2014 this young man, from becoming a young, hot-headed\nassassin, became a true hero. Secondly, whatever damage he did an \u2014 to Jews, which\nresulted in Crystal Night, I think he saved many more lives, or his act saved many\nmore lives than the \u2014 the \u2014 the death that he caused; for the very simple reason that\nimmigration of Jews from Germany and Austria started high in 1933, went down\nthrough 1937, early \u00b038, and then immediately after Crystal Night, immigration shot\nup. So a lot more people left Germany as a result. So in the end, he really \u2014 his act\nreally saved lives, even though 110 - 115 people died in the immediate aftermath of\nCrystal Night.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\nNovember 18, 1997",
        "A: I interviewed a number of people, I interviewed the psychiatrist, the German\npsychiatrist who examined him on behalf of the German government. In fact, I\nvisited him in a hospital in \u2014 in Berlin.",
        "A: [indecipherable] there.",
        "A: I interviewed his lawyer \u2014",
        "A: No, I got his medical opinion, which was reinforced by the documentation we\nfound. He found \u2014 he found him a sla \u2014 somewhat o \u2014 more than average intelligent\nyoung man. Quite mature for his age, but at that point, of course, he had been in\nGerman hands for quite a while. I should say this, that he was treated very well by\nthe Germans, because he was a special prisoner, they wanted him for a big show\ntrial. He \u2014 and while in prison he was allowed to keep his hair. He usually worked in\n\u2014 worked in the kitchen on food distribution, which means that wherever he was\nimprisoned, he had enough to eat. He was not, as far as I can tell, mistreated. And\nwhen the trial finally opened, a decision finally was made to postpone the trial\nindefinitely. Hitler personally described him, or said that he was his personal charge.\nIn other words that nothing was to happen to this young man without Hitler\u2019s\npersonal decision. Now, it probably \u2014 whether it \u2014 whether it finally did happen,\nNovember 18, 1997\nhappened with Hitler\u2019s knowledge or not, a \u2014 chances are he died at the \u2014 towards\nthe very end of the war. He survived most of the war. But let\u2019s see, we interviewed \u2014\nor I interviewed vom Rath\u2019s brother, I interviewed Moro-Giafferi. Moro-Giafferi\nwas the French criminal lawyer who was hired by Dorothy Thompson and a\njournalist group to defend Herschel Grynszpan. And him I saw in Paris in 1946 \u2014\n40 \u2014 late \u2014 in December of 1946.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. He was, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he cracked the case in \u2014 as to what\nthe \u2014 the subsequent argument or this \u2014 the \u2014 what the \u2014 the argument that\nGrynszpan used to avoid a trial. Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan\navoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan\non the world stage, on trial \u2014 for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite\nthe main newspaper people from around th-the \u2014 the neutral Europe. They \u2014 it was a\nbig to-do \u2014 was to be a big propaganda trial. They had built a special courtroom\n[indecipherable] new telephone lines. It was to be a big to-do. And Herschel\nGrynszpan finally announced t \u2014 before \u2014 shortly before the trial was to take place,\nthat he had killed vom Rath because vom Rath had made homosexual advances to\nhim. Now, obviously homosexuality is not what major propaganda trials are made of,\nespecially if the victim was supposedly involved. Well, when I finally did speak to\nhersh \u2014 to Moro-Giafferi in Paris, he \u2014 by the way, he was a\u2014 a man about five foot\nNovember 18, 1997\ntall and five foot wide, who when I saw him the first time, greeted me with the\nstatement that he had ever \u2014 only ever lost one man to the guillotine, and that was\nBluebeard, and \u2014 which I said could be forgiven. And he was the number one\ncriminal lawyer in France in \u2014 in the 20\" century; certainly the first half of the fu \u2014\n20\" century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every \u2014 every major\ncriminal trial, especially murder trials. Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he\nsays, well, let me explain where he got that idea. He says, when I initially took up his\ndefense \u2014 and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point\nwas a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when\nforeign correspondents were still major figures, in \u2014 in the days when you didn\u2019t\nhave instantaneous CNN coverage and so on. He said, I told \u2014 I asked Herschel why\nhe had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what\nhappened to his parents. And I explained that this matter \u2014 Moro-Giafferi speaking\n\u2014 I explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards\npolitical crimes. However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much\nmore lenient. And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able\nto confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in town\nthat he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that\nthere was a homosexual connection between the two. Well, according to Moro-\nGiafferi, Grynszpan rejected this out of hand. But then a few years later\n100November 18, 1997\nremembered it, used it, and basically said to his cellmate, they\u2019re not going to make\nme \u2014 make another show trial out of me, they\u2019ve done enough damage already.",
        "A: Well, I just wanted to put it on paper, and put it in history. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that\nterribly important, because if that hadn't happened, something else would have\ntriggered what happened subsequently, where there would have been a\nKristallnacht, it probably would have happened differently. But I certainly don\u2019t\nthink that Herschel Grynszpan caused it; he was the excuse. And so I don\u2019t\nconsider this book as you know, that terribly important. It\u2019s \u2014 to me it\u2019s an\ninteresting footnote to history. I don\u2019t over \u2014 don\u2019t want to overdramatize the\nimportance of it. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting \u2014 it\u2019s a fascinating life, it\u2019s an interesting\nindividual, certainly the way he turned out to be. And as far he \u2014 he \u2014 I have the\nutmost respect for him, and I felt his story needed to be told.",

        "A: In every which way. I mean, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t help but be affected by\nthese events. I mean, if I had had a normal childhood, if I\u2019d had different\nacquaintances, yes, of course we\u2019re all \u2014 we\u2019re all changed a great deal. I\u2019ve no idea\nwhat we would have been like otherwise, but there\u2019s no question. We\u2019re more \u2014 I\nthink more introspective. We \u2014 we have a different view of life, more serious view of\nlife. No doubt about it.",

For instance, the people\nthat surround you. I mean, as an example, my wife lost both her parents at\nAuschwitz. Being associated with some \u2014 with these people, the more immediate\nvictims, undoubtedly affects you. On the other hand, at the same time, of course, you\nappreciate much more what you have. And I think that\u2019s of \u2014 that\u2019s a positive side of\nit, that you \u2014 you are much more appreciative. You realize what life can be like and\nwhat life is like now. So there are both negative and I guess, in a way, indirectly\ncertain positive aspects to it. But change, a change that, for all of us, are \u2014 are\nprofound.

        "A: Yes, it \u2014 it \u2014 it certainly \u2014 it certainly affects you, you certainly think about it.

It really hit me right then and there. So yes, there are \u2014 there are many times,\nand you try to guard your children, of course, from that sort of thing. One of the\nthings I do when I do inscribe my book on the Holocaust, or, \u201cThe Day the\nHolocaust Began,\u201d I usually write, may our children never fully understand what is\nwritten in this \u2014 what is written here.

But to \u2014 to \u2014 you can\u2019t really describe it.\nIt\u2019s something that happens. It\u2019s not the same thing that triggers it. But yes, it \u2014 it\u2019s\nbrought forth by all sorts of things, whether it\u2019s a\u2014 a book that you read, a\u2014a\npicture that you see, a\u2014a-\u2014a story that you hear, all sorts of things can trigger.\nBecause it \u2014 while it may not be foremost in your mind, it certainly 1s very close to\nthe surface, it\u2019s bound to be.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so. I developed an interest in international\nrelations and \u2014\n104November 18, 1997",
        "A: No, na\u2014 na \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 it can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible I \u2014 my case, to trace\nit to that, no. It\u2019s \u2014 it was \u2014 1t was an interest in \u2014 like intellectual interest and\nknowledge of \u2014 of European history. And interest of \u2014 well, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014-I\u2014I-I\ndon\u2019t think \u2014 I haven\u2019t really thought about this, I don\u2019t think that it 1s traceable back\nto my experiences as a youngster.",
        "A: No. Then it come \u2014 then it depends what \u2014 what the next question \u2014 no, the\nanswer is no. I will, depending on the questioner, respond and tell them what I am, or\nwho I am. But I don\u2019t \u2014 I cannot recall anybody \u2014 I mean, keep in mind I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m\nfortunate. I don\u2019t have a distinguished accent \u2014",
        "A: Well, it depended who it was, the answer would be no. I mean, basically,\nessentially, the answer is no. I do not feel German. I do not feel any special affinity\nfor Germany. I have no special affinity for Germany, no.\n105November 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, I got involved with the museum when I went to see Sybil Milton in the\nhistorian\u2019s office and wanted to see what \u2014 whether I get any comments or a blurb\nfor the back page of the book, and I\u2019ve been paying for it ever since. I did get the\nblurb from Sybil, and she made some very nice remarks about it, but as I say, from\nthat point on, I\u2019ve bil \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with the historian\u2019s office.",
        "A: Oh, this must have been about eight years ago. It was \u2014 well, si \u2014 it must have\nbeen \u2014 well, when the book was in its former state, so it must have been about \u201989, so\nwe're talking about eight years.",
        "A: Well, on the Days of Remembrance book, it depends. I haven\u2019t right now, since\nthere\u2019s a change, I\u2019m not working with them now, but we have been doing various\nthings on the Days of Remembrance book that\u2019s on the chronology, for year by year\nchronology of what happened where. Then we have recently done some work in\nconnection with the claims by American soldiers at \u2014 or Americans who are seeking\nrestitution from Germany for incarceration in concentration camps. And so there\u2019s a\nquestion of definition, what is a concentration camp, because it\u2019s not always clear.\n106November 18, 1997\nSo we\u2019ve been making \u2014 this 1s the Justice Department, we\u2019ve been helping the\nJustice Department on that. So there\u2019s a wide variety of things.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, right now I don\u2019t. I mean, we finished that particular job. It\u2019s usually either\ngoing \u2014 doing some research and documentation in the library, writing up the\nmaterials. It depends which one you\u2019re doing. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019ve done quite a bit of writing\nfor them on these Day of Remembrance books that they put out every year. As I say,\nfor a while there we were doing, in those books there\u2019s a chronology, and \u2014 so you\ngo back and try to find things that happened, or where they happened, during year X\nand so on.",
        "A: Oh, I find it stimulating, I find it interesting, I find \u2014 I f\u2014 one of the things, of\ncourse, I appreciate there 1n that office, is that they have usually a number of young\npeople, young Europeans; German, Austrians, who are working there. For instance\nthere\u2019s some Austrians who work there in lieu of their military service. And it\u2019s\ninteresting to be around them, and to exchange ideas and see what they think, and so\non. It\u2019s a fa \u2014 I find it interesting, challenging, I mean, I ge \u2014I get a lot of intellectual\n107November 18, 1997\nstimulation from my computer, but not that much, you know, they can\u2019t do\neverything.",
        "A: Oh we \u2014 I don\u2019t normally tell my story. It \u2014 it \u2014 there\u2019s usually somebody needed\naround there who puts a little bit of balance. And I mean, you have the, on the\nAmerican side, you have, for the most part, a number of people who know what was\ngoing on. Then you have these young \u2014 relatively younger people. And then they \u2014\nthe \u2014 there needs to be, or it\u2019s helpful occasionally to have somebody who either was\nthere or was directly connected, who can put a little bit, slightly different perspective\non it.",
        "A: Yes, I hope so.",
        "A: Well, it jogged it every now and then, yes, it certainly does. I mean, you come\nacross documentations, or things certainly, when you go back, you go back and do\nresearch on stuff that \u2014 things that happened, or came out during the \u2014 during the\nNuremberg trial, or \u2014 yes, it \u2014 it \u2014 it obviously keeps it \u2014 it keeps it current, it keeps\nit alive. Yes, very much so.\n108November 18, 1997",
        "A: Well, you can talk about the abstract \u2014 in the abstract about certain things going\non. We\u2019re \u2014really we\u2019re talking about the Nuremberg trials, an insider\u2019s view. Not\nnecessarily a \u2014 a\u2014 well, a\u2014a sort of \u2014 a \u2014a \u2014 well, a\u2014 how should I say? An ide \u2014\nwhatever \u2014 well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I \u2014I-\u2014TI really don\u2019t know how to describe it. Basically,\nwhat comes with actually having \u2014 having experience that \u2014 or being around a lot of\npeople who have experienced it. I think \u2014 I think it \u2014 of some help.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s ga \u2014 that\u2019s a highly personal sort of thing. I\u2019ve encouraged a lot of\npeople to go there, both friends and acquaintances. And I guess I think there are even\n\u2014 there are a couple of them that either are working there, or have in the past worked\nthere as a result. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I would not want to recommend somebody to work\nthere, if it doesn\u2019t come to them themselves. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not the sort of place, I mean,\nthat \u2014 I mean, it took me long time to take my wife there, for me to \u2014 for my wife to\ngo there. It depends \u2014 it depends on the individual. And it has to come out of them, I\ndon\u2019t think that it is nece \u2014 certainly somebody who is closely involved with it, who\nhas a personal experience and so on, I\u2019ve encouraged people to go to visit, but I\n109November 18, 1997\nwould \u2014 I would not encourage somebody to work there if they didn\u2019t get that idea\non their own.",
        "A: No. I\u2014I don\u2019t really have too much of a contact with too many others, no.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Well, let me say this way. I \u2014 I have the feeling that being \u2014 I n \u2014I know there are\na number of survivors \u2014 first of all, of course, I have trouble with the word survivor. I\ndo not consider myself a survivor. I know people who\u2019 ve been in L\u00e9dz; they\u2019re\nsurvivors. Then of course then, I am not a survivor, I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a refugee, you can\ncall any sort of thing, but survivor, I don\u2019t feel I am. Then, of course, then there\u2019s the\n\u2014 the group in between, and that is, for instance, my wife, who is out \u2014 who was\nnever in a conce \u2014 went to \u2014 to England in a \u2014 in a children\u2019s transport. Had a much\ntougher time, and of course, most of all, lost her parents. Does she belong in the\nsurvivor cat \u2014 she doesn\u2019t consider herself to be a survivor. It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s very difficult,\nbut to me, the \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question. To my wife\u2019s cousin, who was in\nLodz, or was in \u2014 1n Auschwitz, no question either. It\u2019s that in-between, gray area.\n110November 18, 1997\nThat\u2019s one point. The second point 1s, I don\u2019t think that by virtue of being a survivor,\nyou become an expert. No, quite frankly, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve made myself very unpopular\nalready. I mean, I\u2019ve only attended one survivor group so far, and I\u2019ve made myself\nunpopular [indecipherable] by basically saying, just because somebody\u2019s a survivor,\nthey don \u2014 does not mean that they\u2019re necessarily the best guides. So ve been\naccused since then of being an academic, or being too \u2014 too feeling that you have to\nhave university degree and so on. Which isn\u2019t, of course, at all what I\u2019m talking\nabout. I\u2019m just saying that, being the be \u2014 being the best guide, or a guide, it\u2019s\ninteresting to be able to say to a group, this person lived through it, but that does not\nmake that \u2014 that\u2019s important, but it doesn\u2019t make necessarily a \u2014 a qualified guide, or\nthe best guide. There might be somebody who had no connection with it, and yet still\nis able to do a great job. So, I have a \u2014 perhaps a slightly different point of view than\nsome of my fellow volunteers.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m affected deeply by certain areas. Obviously, like some \u2014 everybody else\nbe it the \u2014 the picture gallery, be it th-the \u2014 the shoes. I mean, you can\u2019t help but be\naffected by. But not \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 and I\u2019m sure different things affect different\nNovember 18, 1997\npeople, although there\u2019s certain things like these, that aboundly affect just about\neverybody who\u2019s \u2014 has any feeling whatsoever.",
        "A: No, I think you have been very \u2014 this has been rather exhaustive, and I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ve ever talked quite as much as this in my life.\n"
