        "Question: It is May 6, 1996. This is an interview with Gisela Feldman, a survivor of the SS St.\nLouis. Now first what I would like to ask you is if you would state your name, your date of birth,\nand where you were born.",
        "Answer: Yes, well. My name is Gisela Feldman and my maiden name was Klapl, K-L-A-P-L, and I\nwas born on the 18th of September, 1923, in Berlin, Germany.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about growing up in Berlin at that time and about your schooling and\nyour parents?",
        "A: I was born in 1923, as I said, and so I had 10 years without Hitler. My parents originally came\nfrom Poland, the Austrian-Hungarian empire of Poland, at the age of 15, so by the time I was born,\nthey had been in Germany for about twenty years. During the first 10 years, what I can remember is\npeople still had housing shortages and that was a result of the first world war, and it was very\ndifficult to get a decent flat. But that affected everybody, it wasn\u2019t something that we felt we were\nsingled out for that. But when it got to some of 1932, I was nine then, I became aware of the fact,\nthere was some sort of tension between the Nazi Party and the Communists. I remember marches in\nthe street where people beat each other up. And in the block of flats where I lived, a person was\neven shot because they were demonstrating against the Nazi Party. So that in a nine year old,\naroused some sort of fear that something was about to happen.",
        "Q: What was it like at school? Did you feel very well acclimated?",
        "A: Yes I did. In fact my sister and I were the only Jewish children in the school. And during the\nsort of beginnings of the Nazi party I had a very good teacher and he kept telling all the children that\nI was no different from anybody else and they had to treat me very well and all that. But that didn\u2019t\ngo on for too long because when I reached the age of 11 and I had to go to a secondary school, I had\nto go to a Jewish school because it was very difficult to stay on in a state school.",
        "Q: You had many friends?",
        "A: Yes, I had a, I used to play with the children in the street and I didn\u2019t feel too discriminated\nagainst playing with the other children in the street, but I was always blonde and blue-eyed and so I\nsuppose that made a difference too.",
        "Q: Was your family particularly religious?",
        "A: Well, not a terribly orthodox, but I as a child, I wouldn\u2019t ride on a sharbot(ph) and I wouldn\u2019t\nswitch the light on. However my father kept his shop open after going to a service in the morning,\nhe came back because we lived in such a Christian neighborhood that, you know, we had to keep\nthe shop open on a Saturday. And our customers really didn\u2019t stay away from us until an SS man\nstood guard outside the shop and told people not to buy from Jews. And even then, some of them\nwere very brave they came in and we had one particular customer across the road from us, a\nCatholic baker, and they also weren\u2019t very fond of the Nazis, and you know bakers have to get up\nvery early to bake their bread, and they found somebody dobbing(ph) their shop windows, friends\nof the Jews, and so they just poured buckets of water from the balcony over them. So that was\nreally a very brave act in the climate.",
        "Q: Do you have a sense of how your parents felt at this time and what did your father do? What\nkind of shop was it?",
        "A: We had a grocery store. Well, once or twice my father was beaten up 1n the dark when he came\nhome from the shop. And then things got a little difficult. But you see, when you\u2019re sort of 12, 13,\nyou don\u2019t quite realize the dangers that were going on. But we did know of people whose fathers\ndisappeared or they used to go and sleep in other people\u2019s houses, so when the party came to pick\nthem up they wouldn\u2019t be at home, they couldn\u2019t be found. So yes, things were getting very sort of\ndisturbing. But you know, people always say to me, \u201cWhy did people not leave early on?,\u201d and the\nonly theory I can have is, if you are very poor you can go because you\u2019ve got nothing to lose, and if\nyou were rich, you know at the beginning you were allowed to take your money out with you, but if\nyou are a middle-class person then you sort of value a little bit of security. So that\u2019s the only\nexplanation I have because we didn\u2019t leave until 39 which was the last moment almost.",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t talk to you much about what they were thinking or about possibly immigrating\nsooner?",
        "A: No, my parents really I think protected us quite a lot. They didn\u2019t show their fears a great deal.\nAnd our final moment really came when my father was deported in 1938. I don\u2019t know whether\nyou know that. My father had a Polish passport and at that time the Poles said that anybody who\nhadn\u2019t returned to Poland for a number of years was going to lose their passports, and I think the\nNazis got a little bit worried that they were going to be left with all these people with Polish\nnationality and they picked up all the men during the night and just deported them to Poland. And I\nthink that\u2019s when things started really to, for us, to reach a high point where we had to decide to do\nsomething, although we had to shut our shop before that so when my father was deported he didn\u2019t\nhave any income anymore.",
        "Q: Tell me, just going back just a little bit, when they closed the shop, when was that?",
        "A: That was sort of the beginning of 38. And they also made me leave school because it was then\ndecided education wasn\u2019t going to be much use to you if you had to go into a country where you\ndidn\u2019t speak the language. So people got their children to learn a trade. I went to dress-making\nschool, people became plumbers, and and so on because you felt if you had a trade\nin your hands you didn\u2019t need to know the language.",
        "Q: And what was your mother. Was your mother a full-time housekeeper?",
        "A: No, she worked with my father in the shop. And we had a maid. Which of course I don\u2019t\nremember which year 34, 35, you weren\u2019t allowed to have anyone anymore unless they were over\n50. Because you know there was this word rusenshen(ph), I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve come across it.\nBut that\u2019s why you\u2019re not allowed to have anybody under 50.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about when your father was deported and how that came about and how you\nfirst found out.",
        "A: Well, that was obviously something, a very well kept secret because in October, the 28th of\nOctober I think, during the night there is a ring at the door and two men came in civilian clothes\nactually, and they said to my father , \u201cPack your bag, get your passport\u201d . And you know that was a\nvery frightening experience and my sister panicked, she\u2019s three years younger than I, and she started\nshouting at them and they said , \u201cWell if you don\u2019t keep quiet we will take you away as well.\u201d I\nmust have kept calm because I remember I got up and made sandwiches for my father for him to\ntake the sandwiches. But we didn\u2019t know why or what or where they were going to go, they didn\u2019t\ntell us, and while they were watching my father I rushed out down the street to go to a phone and\nphone my uncles to warn them, but a strange man answered the phone so we knew they had also got\nthem. And, then some sort of rumor came about that they had been taken to the railway stations,\nand then all the women rushed to the railway station to see if they could still see their husbands or\nfathers, but we didn\u2019t see our father, but eventually we heard from him that he was in Poland. And\nthey had apparently there was some sort of tug-of-war between the Germans and the Poles because\nthe Poles didn\u2019t want to take them, the Germans wouldn\u2019t let them back, and there was a camp\nwhere they held all these people which was called bonchin(ph) and but my father still had family in\nPoland so he and his two brothers went to the family.",
        "Q: So after he arrived in Poland you were able to correspond with him?",
        "A: We were going to speak to with him on the phone, we were able to speak to him on the phone.\nYes. Well it wasn\u2019t war time yet, you see, it was 38, it was just before Crystal Night actually that\nthey were deported. The 28th of October, Crystal Night was in November so it wasn\u2019t very far\napart.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit about Crystal Night and that evening.",
        "A: Well, I really got up, we got up the next morning, and you see not living in a Jewish area we\nweren\u2019t so aware as to what had happened. Our shop had gone so really there wasn\u2019t much Jewish\nproperty for them to destroy. But when we heard about it I walked to my Aunt\u2019s house and yes, you\nwere walking through glass. You know once you neared Jewish shops and the synagogue and so on\nthen you could see what had happened. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called Crystal Night, isn\u2019t it? We were\nwalking on glass.",
        "Q: In between the time that your father was deported and the time that you were attempting to leave\ndid things get progressively worse? What was it like for you?",
        "A: First of all we were asked to leave our flat, for a German couple, and strangely enough my\nmother went to court and the judge gave her three months, which was quite unheard of, you know,\nthat he should allow us to stay, and so he gave us three months, and we moved in with my aunt after\nthat whose husband had also been deported. And then my mother started seriously to look around\nfor some place for us to go. Because we had no income. There was no safety anymore. We\nchildren couldn\u2019t go to school. So obviously, rather late, but we knew then that we had to leave,\nbecause you see even the lot of the German people I think didn\u2019t believe that our friends anyway\nthat he could stay in power. And a lot of the Jewish people who had become so much part of the\ncountry and the professional people who held jobs in hospitals and everywhere, nobody could\nbelieve that an intelligent nation could allow in a dictator which in a way wasn\u2019t imposed on them,\nbecause Hindenburg supported him and he really got in by legal means but nobody thought that\nsuch a tyranny could go on but they are, that\u2019s what happened. And so then my mother started\nlooking around and by that time it was very difficult to get a visa to go to any country, and so people\ntook any visa they could get. I know friends of ours went to China and eventually these Cuban\nvisas came up and you had to pay for them with them with foreign currency, which really meant\nyou had to smuggle money out of Germany in order to have dollars to pay for these visas, which my\nmother did, she smuggled money out, and she didn\u2019t even know who it was going to, it was some\nsort of code name, you know she talked to somebody about uncle so and so, I remember that as a\nchild. And then eventually we bought visas with the foreign currency, and which was supposed to\nbe perfectly legal. And then my mother had to arrange a boat to take us across and she got four\npassages on the boat called the St. Louis which was meant to sail from Hamburg on May the 13th,\nwhich it did. And the Germans allowed people to come back into Germany providing they were\nleaving again. It was a sort of transit visa they allowed them. My father applied to come back and\nthe Poles sent the wrong brother back, so my father didn\u2019t make it. And so my father phoned up in\ntears and he told my mother not to go without him, and she must have been a very determined\nwoman because she said \u201cI have to take the children out.\u201d In any case, there was another boat\nleaving after ours, the Orinoco and she couldn\u2019t get four passages on the next boat, but one she\ncould get, so she was determined to take up three of the passages and my father was going to join us\nafterwards on the next boat.",
        "Q: You had how many siblings?",
        "A: [had a sister, I have a sister still, yes.",
        "Q: So at the time you had your mother, you and your sister, the three of you?",
        "A: Three of us were going yes. And actually the finalization of the visas didn\u2019t happen until the last\nminute. We were to leave on a Saturday and Friday morning we still hadn\u2019t heard that everything\nwas finalized, so my mother rushed off to sort things out, then she called me on the phone and I\nwent with her, and then on the Friday afternoon we got everything finalized, and we phoned my 12\nyear-old sister and she did all the packing and we left on the Friday night.",
        "Q: Do you know much more about how she obtained...",
        "A: The visa?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. I just know that she had to pay with it for it with foreign currency and I\nthink they were bought abroad, paid for abroad in the Cuban embassy.",
        "Q: So your father never made it out?",
        "A: Never made it out, no? You know, if you know the story of the St. Louis, when we got to\nHavana, they wouldn\u2019t allow us to land, and the next boat was leaving two weeks later, and when\nthe captain heard that we couldn\u2019t land I think they got as far as Antwerp, they turned back but they\ndidn\u2019t tell the passengers they were turning back, and they ended up back in Germany and then my\nfather had to go back to Poland and we never saw him again.",
        "Q: So he did manage the next boat?",
        "A: He managed the next boat but he went back to Germany and then eventually to Poland.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit about the passage, initially you were on the SS. St. Louis?",
        "A: Yes, well we left on May the 13th, and if you manage to get a hold of the documentary, you will\nsee how efficient the Germans are because they found all the old footage of us getting on, and they\neven found me as a 15 year old amongst all that crowd getting onto the boat. But we left on May\nthe 13th and for us youngsters it was really quite an adventure, because this was a luxury liner, and\nthe captain was a wonderful man. He instructed the crew that we had to be treated like anybody\nelse. We had to pay for the return journey, but nobody really saw anything into that because we all\nfelt the ship was going to come back empty and it was only fair that they were paid for this. And it\nwas an experience to be on a liner where you had a cinema and a ballroom and a swimming pool,\nand all the usual games you have on a boat. Obviously very few of us had ever been on a cruise so\nit was exciting for us youngsters. But my mother never took part in anything. She didn\u2019t worry us,\nyou know. And it must have been an awful thing to leave your place where you\u2019ve lived, and leave\na husband behind who didn\u2019t want you to go. My mother had ten marks, which I don\u2019t know how\nmuch it would have been then, perhaps twenty dollars or something for the three of us, that is all we\nwere allowed to take out. So she must have been terribly worried about the future, you know two\nchildren, twenty dollars, no job, nothing to go back to. And so, but she never worried us at all. And\nduring the first 10 days we really had a very good time until we landed and found that things began\nto go wrong.",
        "Q: What was the feeling within the passengers with you as a teenager could get a sense of anywhere\nalong the line between the...?",
        "A: The main thing is, we saw so many people with shaven heads. And it appears then, we sort of\nfound out they were people let out of concentration camps, they had to sign papers to say they\nwould never return to Germany, they were let out, and these people seemed to take longer to take\npart in the festivities that were going on, and so on. We had our Friday night services, we had a\nportrait of Hitler in the ballroom, but the captain allowed us take it off during the services and then it\nhad to be put back after the service. It\u2019s very difficult for me now to say what I remember as a\nteenager and what I\u2019ve read since, of course, it\u2019s very difficult to separate these things. Because\nthere was also a book written about it, called \u201cThe Voyage of the Damned,\u201d but unfortunately I feel\nit\u2019s a little bit of a soap opera and they made a film of that too. And so I don\u2019t know if I know it\nfrom the book I read or whether I really knew it that there were people watching us. The only thing\nI know is my mother had a cabin on her own and one night she woke up and found somebody\nsearching through things and walking around the cabin. And after that she never slept alone again.\nSo I don\u2019t know how much truth there was in it all, that we were being watched.",
        "Q: Did you know before you hit Havana at all that the visas, the transit passes was canceled?",
        "A: Not really, except somebody said on the way there that there was another boat coming from\nsomewhere else, and I can\u2019t remember where from, England or somewhere else, and they said, \u201cWe\nreally should hurry and get there before the other boat so that we don\u2019t have to hang about too\nlong.\u201d Now I don\u2019t know if there is any significance in that or not, but for certain we didn\u2019t know\nanything until we got there, and we were even told to get up very early the next morning and had\nour breakfast and we were lined up with all our suitcases ready to get off, and the boat stopped quite\na way outside the harbor. Well, once again we thought that was quite normal, you know, it is\nalways deep enough for the boat to go right into the harbor and we had stopped outside, and the\nCuban police came on and the immigration people, and then suddenly the atmosphere changed and\nwe were told, \u201cnot today, not today, meyeniana(ph) tomorrow, tomorrow,\u201d but tomorrow never\ncame, and then people were getting anxious but nobody ever gave up hope. You know we were so\nnear America we never thought anybody would allow us to go back to Germany. I mean nine\nhundred and odd people that\u2019s really nothing is it , a drop in the ocean.",
        "Q: There were some people who left the boat?",
        "A: Yes, but they were I think Spaniards and Cubans or something, and one family I remember\nleaving, left because I think somebody paid them a lot of money for them, but I think they were just\nfamily if I remember correctly. But the others I think were people that had that weren\u2019t refugees\nthat had come to holiday or to play in a band or something but I really don\u2019t remember these things.\nAnd one man of course committed suicide and he was left behind. And that I remember very well\nbecause I was standing by the deck and I saw him rushing out of the bathroom with the blood\ndripping down and he ran to the edge and jumped into the water. And one of the sailors actually\njumped after him and rescued him. But even when he was in the rescue launch, he was still trying\nto pull his arteries out and he didn\u2019t want to be saved.",
        "Q: He had cut himself?",
        "A: Yes, with a razor blade. Because he\u2018d been in a camp and decided he wouldn\u2019t go back, and I\nsuppose people\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t good you know when they got on the boat, their minds must\nhave been very confused anyway, and then to be faced with the problems that we might have had to\nface, he couldn\u2019t put up with.",
        "Q: So what happened, you\u2019re in Havana for a few days?",
        "A: Several days, yes. And then they decided, the Cuban authorities decided, that no boat could stay\nin the harbor for such a length of time and that we should leave the, I think it\u2019s a three mile zone or\nwhatever it is, and just go back and cruise around until more arrangements were made. And I\nbelieve the American Joint(ph) worked very hard for us, and they wanted to pay money for us, but I\nthink it was more a political issue because I think whatever they offered it was decided not to accept\nthe money and not to accept us. Whatever reason they could give for us, I really don\u2019t know, I\nreally only know what I have heard since, so I don\u2019t know what the political issue was that why they\nwouldn\u2019t have us. And then we just went off and cruised along the coast of Miami and Florida and\nthe gun boats came out in case somebody jumped overboard and swam ashore you know, and so.\nAnd eventually when we turned back towards Germany, we still really didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening because we didn\u2019t know which direction we were going in, so for quite a time we were in\na way left in the dark except they had a committee which apparently knew what was going on but\ncertainly we teenagers didn\u2019t know what was going on.",
        "Q: Do you think your mother was involved in...?",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t involved in the committee, no.",
        "Q: Did she know much more than you did about what was going on?",
        "A: Well, she never showed anything, you know. I just know that she never took part in any of the\njournification so obviously she was worried all along, so I really don\u2019t know if she knew any more\nthan we did, but probably she suspected more than we did. Probably had a greater fear than we did.",
        "Q: Now what was life, what did you do just on a daily basis on the ship as all of this was happening\nas a teenager, as a child?",
        "A: You mean after we couldn\u2019t land, because before that we had a jolly good time, we swam and\nplayed games and went to dances and film shows.",
        "Q: After Havana while you were in Havana and then you..?.",
        "A: Well, then really very few people attended the sort of film shows, and the dances, and all that,\nbecause there was a sort of cloud hanging over us, even though you had hope that you weren\u2019t\ngoing to, that you were going to land somewhere eventually, but obviously it was a worrying time\nbecause you didn\u2019t know what your future held for you.",
        "Q: Did you make new friends while you were on the boat?",
        "A: Yes, I made quite a lot of friends but really we didn\u2019t keep it up because a small, a quarter of the\npeople ended up in England, and a lot of those eventually got to America anyway because so many\nof them had quota numbers to get into America at a future date, and so quite a few left during the\nwar even, and I think we were sort of spread around the country, and I in particular was sent away,\nstraightaway two days after we arrived I was sent to a convalescent home by the seaside to scrub\nfloors for them you know, because the only work you were allowed to do was domestic work, so I\nwas sent away straightaway.",
        "Q: So this is after, obviously you returned to Antwerp.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you were still in Belgtum?",
        "A: Oh no, no, we ended up in England, sorry. Yes, well eventually when we had to go back\ntowards and we knew we were going back towards Germany, as far as I know several other people\ntried to commit suicide, and we had a group of young people checking all the cabins to watch\npeople, and it was a very grim atmosphere then of course. And when we were off the coast of\nEngland suddenly we heard that Belgium, Holland, France, and England were prepared to take a\nquarter each of the people. And obviously a lot of people wanted to go England, because the other\ncountries were to near Germany. And my father obviously knew what was going on because he\nsent us a telegram and said \u201cChoose England.\u201d But really one didn\u2019t have a choice. They decided\nwhere people should go and people\u2019s different nationalities they had different quotas how many\npeople they would take in of each nationality and my mother told me to go and speak to the\nImmigration, English Immigration Officer because I had learned English at school. How good my\nEnglish was I really don\u2019t know, but I did talk to the man and whether that had any influence or not\nI really don\u2019t know. But luckily we ended up in England. But the boat first landed in Belgium, and\nthe people that were staying in Belgium obviously got off and the others were transferred by trains\nto Holland and France, and we were put on a sort of cargo ship and taken to England. And we\u2019ve\nheard since that at the time Gobels(ph) published in the newspapers you see nobody wants\nsamiva(ph) at least we are building camps for them.",
        "Q: So you went to England...?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you all three stayed together?",
        "A: Well, not quite. We stayed together for the first few days, because the Jewish Committee, 1t was\nin London, it was Woben(ph) House, gave people, put people into the hotel for the first week, but I\nafter three days we were sent away immediately. My sister was 13 and she went to school.",
        "Q: So where were you sent away?",
        "A: It was seaside place called Broadstairs(ph). It was a convalescent home actually for Jewish\nrefugees. And, but, the matron of the convalescent home was not Jewish, and there were three of us\nactually and we were always hungry. The didn\u2019t feed us very well.",
        "Q: So this was the middle of, this 1s the end of June, the beginning of July?",
        "A: Yes, in fact we came to England on the 19th of June I think, because my sister\u2019s birthday is on\nthe 18th and we still had that on the boat. Yes, that was towards the end of June then, yes, yes, and I\nstayed there until September and then I met a family on the beach and they asked me if I would\ncome and look after their children for them, of 6 and 11, and I was getting in English money, 25\np(ph) a week and they were offering me a pound a week or something, and so I obviously accepted,\nended with going back to London so I accepted that job and the children were as I said six and a half\nand 11, and I was 15, and they asked me to do the cooking and the cleaning, and if the children\ncouldn\u2019t go to school they asked me to write the letters to teachers, so somebody must have had\ngreat fun reading my writing, but still.",
        "Q: And what about your mother and your sister, what were they doing at this time?",
        "A: My mother eventually found work with some...[end of side one]. So, at what point do you want\nme to start?",
        "Q: Oh. I kind of like, eventually we can get back to what we were just talking about, but you were\nin England and you were working for a family.",
        "A: Yes, I was working for a family then and then of course the war broke out, and I was in London\nand we, at one stage, went and slept in the underground stations to protect ourselves because of the\nbombing. But I stayed with that family for about six months and once war broke out, we were\nallowed to do war work, and so then my sister had been evacuated by then, but my mother and I\nfound rooms and we lived together and I went to work making soldiers uniforms and gunpowder\nbags, and so on.",
        "Q: What was the name of the family that you stayed with in England?",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t say that. Nash(ph), actually Nash(ph) yes. It was an English family Nash(ph) yes,\nchanged from Nashinski(ph) , yes.",
        "Q: So you came back together with...?",
        "A: My mother and then eventually my sister came back from her evacuation too, yes. She went to a\ndressmaking school actually and then had to find a job. And I was working, but in 1943 I got\nmarried and moved out again, I got married at 19 and a half.",
        "Q: And how did that come about, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?",
        "A: How did that come about? I went to a Czech garden party with a man actually who has since\nbecame an actor, his name was Herbert Long, but he wasn\u2019t an actor in the days I knew him, he\nplayed in the Pink Panther films, but you won\u2019t remember that you are too young. But, and my\nhusband asked me to, well, this man asked me to dance, and then saw me home afterwards and told\nme that if I was still going out with him two months later I would marry him and that was it. And\nmy husband was 21 and I was 19 and a half but he had no family. He came from Poland and he was\nalone so possibly that\u2019s the reason he was in such a hurry.",
        "Q: And so you are married?",
        "A: I was married, yes. And then my husband decided perhaps he should go to university, and so he\ndidn\u2019t go to university until after we were married.",
        "Q: You stayed in London together?",
        "A: For a period, but the university he went to was in Sheffield, and so we moved to Sheffield for\nfour years until he got his degree.",
        "Q: What was it like in London, you continued to work?",
        "A: Yes, we had our bombings and hiding in shelters, and eventually I think a lot of people gave up\nand just took their chances. And of course we had the blackout. It was very difficult to find your\nway around because in those days we still had these famous London fogs that you only see in\nSherlock Holmes films nowadays and I can remember ending up in somebody else\u2019s yard at the\nback of the house because it really was quite impossible to see and find your way around. On the\nother hand one felt very, very safe. You know you\u2019d walk around without being able to see\nanybody and people would talk to you and as a young girl, you never felt afraid to walk about.",
        "Q: What was, as far as Europe, what was happening in Europe and the holocaust there, the in\ntime...?",
        "A: Well one didn\u2019t really know how horrible it all was, you know. And we still heard from my\nfather for some time. But I\u2019d just like to back when we first came to England. My mother couldn\u2019t\nspeak English so she went to the East end of London, which was the Jewish part in those days, and\nshe could speak Yiddish, and she went from place to place, from shop to shop, and asked somebody\nif they could guarantee for my father to come out, because he could come if you had somebody that\nwould guarantee for you, and in fact she found somebody who offered him a job, and his papers\nwere being processed and the war broke out, so he lost his second chance there. So I\u2019m only saying\nthat just to add again what a brave woman my mother was, making a decision for us to leave\nwithout him with two children and very little money, and then she immediately set about trying to\nget him out, and so she was really a very active woman because we relied a lot on her before we left\nGermany too because when we had our business eventually wholesalers wouldn\u2019t deliver to Jewish\nshops, so my mother used to get up at 5:00 in the morning and go to the markets and bring in the\neggs and the butter so we could still sell the stuff in the, in the shop. So she really was a very, very\nstrong, active woman. But now getting back to after the war started, we heard from my father until\nabout 1940, because we had family in Romania and in Switzerland so he could send the mail via\nthese two addresses. Just recently I came across a postcard from him actually and which I think\nhistorically is quite interesting because he gives his address in Poland, which was, the town was\nGesshue(ph) and it says \u201cGermany\u201d and in brackets \u201cFormally Poland.\u201d So in effect you see once\nthe Germans invaded Poland the address had to be Germany. It is interesting, isn\u2019t it? Until I\nlooked through all the stuff my mother left behind, I didn\u2019t realize how really historically interesting\nthat must be that they had to write their address \u201c\u201cGermany,\u201d and in brackets \u201cFormally Poland.\u201d",
        "Q: What were the, what did you hear from your father, any indication of what was going on?",
        "A: There were only a few lines actually, we haven\u2019t heard for such a long time, are you well, I\u2019m\nsorry you have to work so hard, write, and you know that\u2019s just these few lines. And my husband\nactually he died three years ago but before that went back to Poland because apparently they have\nquite a few archives there too, to see if he could find out what happened to my family, but they had\nrecords of people who died a natural death, but not records of people who were eventually sent\naway or deported so we never found out what happened.",
        "Q: So eventually the correspondence just stopped?",
        "A: Correspondence stopped yes. And of course the Red Cross made all sorts of inquiries so you\nknow nobody turned up after the war, so one knew that they had gone.",
        "Q: What was it like when you first, when you were in England, what was it like? Was it easy to\nacclimate? You spoke at least a little bit of English.",
        "A: Yes well, I must have spoken quite a lot, because I was sent out to do the shopping, and of\ncourse I was in that convalescent home, and the matron that ran it only spoke English, and I think I\nprobably learned quite a lot looking after the children too. So, I seemed to have, as I say, learned it\nvery quickly, because I can remember after I got married being ill, and the doctors saying to my\nhusband, \u201cThat\u2019s a real Londoner you\u2019ve got there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d So I must have lost my accent fairly\nquickly too.",
        "Q: So it was fairly easy acclimating?",
        "A: Yes, for me it was, yes, yes.",
        "Q: How about your mother. She sounded like she, where were you living in England, was it East\nend?",
        "A: No, no, we weren\u2019t living in the East end, at one time we were living in Klisl(ph) Park, and then\neventually we had a flat in West Hampstead. Actually only about a year before I got married we\ntook on that flat.",
        "Q: And did you become involved in the Jewish community at all besides.........",
        "A: Well, not an awful lot. We had Jewish friends and I had one particular friend from the boat\nactually, who eventually emigrated to Australia and I am still in touch with her and I even went to\nsee her in Australia, and some of the people from the boat, although I hadn\u2019t remembered them but\nwhen we had this reunion to make the documentary, actually they only had nine of us because that\u2019s\nall they could afford, three people from England and six from America and three of the six, I am\ngoing to see on this trip.",
        "Q: So, you were married, and then you eventually went to Sheffield?",
        "A: We went to Sheffield for my husband to do his studies. And he did a degree in glass\ntechnology(ph) which is an unusual subject, but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought\nhis parents over to England because they had, in fact, they lived in Krakoff(ph) and as the Germans\nmarched in they marched out towards the Russian side and eventually the Russians sent them right\ndeep into Russia and although they had an awful war, there were no worse off than of the Russians\nbecause nobody had any food, so they were discriminated against where they were and they came\nback to Krakoff(ph) right after the war, and then we brought them over to England and they always\nsaid they had been the happiest years of their lives. So that was great.",
        "Q: So after the war everything was fine?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I mean we lead perfectly normal lives. We had our first child in 1950, a daughter who\nlives in California, and we had two more children, one of them we lost he died at the age of 18, he\nhad polio and eventually ended up in a car accident in an invalid car, and then I have a son in\nManchester in England and I have now left London to live near him since I lost my husband.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?",
        "A: Well, I think perhaps everything that is of interest I have told you because once I got married we\nlead a fairly ordinary life, perhaps not so ordinary as far as people are concerned now because we\nbrought his parents over, we kept them for awhile, and it isn\u2019t often that the children are responsible\nfor parents, it is normally the other way around. But it was such a normal thing in those days. You\nnever felt that you had been hard done by or you did more than you should have done. I think we\noften felt very sad about my mother. You don\u2019t realize until it happens to you. My mother had 18\nyears of married life and when we were youngsters we thought that was a long time, but obviously\nit isn\u2019t a long time. And so she really had a very hard time. We often felt sorry for her, but she was\nnever a miserable person, and all she said was \u201cI just want to see my daughters married,\u201d and when\nshe saw her daughters married, \u201cI just want to see my grandchildren,\u201d you know, so really there\u2019s\nalways people always hope for more. And then eventually she even saw her great-grandchildren so\nthat was great.",
        "Q: So she went on the best that she could?",
        "A: She died in her 91st year, so really...and dearly loved by everybody. Her sons-in-law thought\nshe wonderful because she never interfered. And so we really had a very nice family life, yes.",
        "Q: You were saying earlier that you didn\u2019t find any difficulty talking about your experiences and do\nyou have any reflections on the Holocaust and what happened in Europe and what may have\nhappened to you and what may have happened to your father?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s something that I think is horrendous, but it\u2019s quite difficult to comprehend even though\nyou know it has all happened. And I must say that I watch all the films and things and people\nalways say to me \u201cWhy do you punish yourself like that?\u201d And I just feel that at least I must\nexperience second-hand what these people went through. I think it\u2019s a cowardly attitude to say, \u201cTI\ncan\u2019t watch these things\u201d because if my family could go through it at least I should know and get\nupset by what they\u2019ve been through. But everybody has to deal with things in their own way, I\nsuppose. But not to want to know, I think, is really denying the fact that these people existed and\nwhat happened to them. Well I hope you feel happy with what I\u2019ve told you.",
        "Q: I really appreciate you taking the time to do it.",
        "A: Yes, but do you feel you\u2019ve had sufficiently out of this interview, or did you want to ask me any\nquestions?",
        "Q: I think it was very good, and it\u2019s important that being young at the time, you only told us what\nyou actually saw, that\u2019s good and it\u2019s very important.",
        "A: Yes, but when people have talked to me before I always felt I had to be honest about the fact that\nyou cannot really know exactly what you have experienced or what you remember from your\nexperience or what you\u2019ve read since. And I think perhaps everybody must feel that difficulty.",
        "Q: Yeah, I think that\u2019s something you are obviously very conscious of because there are things. It\nhas been 50 years, 60 years, and obviously there are a lot of life experiences and a lot of knowledge\nsince then that incorporate into our memories, and it\u2019s important that we find this out.",
        "A: Well, thank you.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Yes, well. My name is Gisela Feldman and my maiden name was Klapl, K-L-A-P-L, and I\nwas born on the 18th of September, 1923, in Berlin, Germany.",
        "A: I was born in 1923, as I said, and so I had 10 years without Hitler. My parents originally came\nfrom Poland, the Austrian-Hungarian empire of Poland, at the age of 15, so by the time I was born,\nthey had been in Germany for about twenty years. During the first 10 years, what I can remember is\npeople still had housing shortages and that was a result of the first world war, and it was very\ndifficult to get a decent flat. But that affected everybody, it wasn\u2019t something that we felt we were\nsingled out for that. But when it got to some of 1932, I was nine then, I became aware of the fact,\nthere was some sort of tension between the Nazi Party and the Communists. I remember marches in\nthe street where people beat each other up. And in the block of flats where I lived, a person was\neven shot because they were demonstrating against the Nazi Party. So that in a nine year old,\naroused some sort of fear that something was about to happen.",
        "A: Yes I did. In fact my sister and I were the only Jewish children in the school. And during the\nsort of beginnings of the Nazi party I had a very good teacher and he kept telling all the children that\nI was no different from anybody else and they had to treat me very well and all that. But that didn\u2019t\ngo on for too long because when I reached the age of 11 and I had to go to a secondary school, I had\nto go to a Jewish school because it was very difficult to stay on in a state school.",
        "A: Yes, I had a, I used to play with the children in the street and I didn\u2019t feel too discriminated\nagainst playing with the other children in the street, but I was always blonde and blue-eyed and so I\nsuppose that made a difference too.",
        "A: Well, not a terribly orthodox, but I as a child, I wouldn\u2019t ride on a sharbot(ph) and I wouldn\u2019t\nswitch the light on. However my father kept his shop open after going to a service in the morning,\nhe came back because we lived in such a Christian neighborhood that, you know, we had to keep\nthe shop open on a Saturday. And our customers really didn\u2019t stay away from us until an SS man\nstood guard outside the shop and told people not to buy from Jews. And even then, some of them\nwere very brave they came in and we had one particular customer across the road from us, a\nCatholic baker, and they also weren\u2019t very fond of the Nazis, and you know bakers have to get up\nvery early to bake their bread, and they found somebody dobbing(ph) their shop windows, friends\nof the Jews, and so they just poured buckets of water from the balcony over them. So that was\nreally a very brave act in the climate.",
        "A: We had a grocery store. Well, once or twice my father was beaten up 1n the dark when he came\nhome from the shop. And then things got a little difficult. But you see, when you\u2019re sort of 12, 13,\nyou don\u2019t quite realize the dangers that were going on. But we did know of people whose fathers\ndisappeared or they used to go and sleep in other people\u2019s houses, so when the party came to pick\nthem up they wouldn\u2019t be at home, they couldn\u2019t be found. So yes, things were getting very sort of\ndisturbing. But you know, people always say to me, \u201cWhy did people not leave early on?,\u201d and the\nonly theory I can have is, if you are very poor you can go because you\u2019ve got nothing to lose, and if\nyou were rich, you know at the beginning you were allowed to take your money out with you, but if\nyou are a middle-class person then you sort of value a little bit of security. So that\u2019s the only\nexplanation I have because we didn\u2019t leave until 39 which was the last moment almost.",
        "A: No, my parents really I think protected us quite a lot. They didn\u2019t show their fears a great deal.\nAnd our final moment really came when my father was deported in 1938. I don\u2019t know whether\nyou know that. My father had a Polish passport and at that time the Poles said that anybody who\nhadn\u2019t returned to Poland for a number of years was going to lose their passports, and I think the\nNazis got a little bit worried that they were going to be left with all these people with Polish\nnationality and they picked up all the men during the night and just deported them to Poland. And I\nthink that\u2019s when things started really to, for us, to reach a high point where we had to decide to do\nsomething, although we had to shut our shop before that so when my father was deported he didn\u2019t\nhave any income anymore.",
        "A: That was sort of the beginning of 38. And they also made me leave school because it was then\ndecided education wasn\u2019t going to be much use to you if you had to go into a country where you\ndidn\u2019t speak the language. So people got their children to learn a trade. I went to dress-making\nschool, people became plumbers, and and so on because you felt if you had a trade\nin your hands you didn\u2019t need to know the language.",
        "A: No, she worked with my father in the shop. And we had a maid. Which of course I don\u2019t\nremember which year 34, 35, you weren\u2019t allowed to have anyone anymore unless they were over\n50. Because you know there was this word rusenshen(ph), I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve come across it.\nBut that\u2019s why you\u2019re not allowed to have anybody under 50.",
        "A: Well, that was obviously something, a very well kept secret because in October, the 28th of\nOctober I think, during the night there is a ring at the door and two men came in civilian clothes\nactually, and they said to my father , \u201cPack your bag, get your passport\u201d . And you know that was a\nvery frightening experience and my sister panicked, she\u2019s three years younger than I, and she started\nshouting at them and they said , \u201cWell if you don\u2019t keep quiet we will take you away as well.\u201d I\nmust have kept calm because I remember I got up and made sandwiches for my father for him to\ntake the sandwiches. But we didn\u2019t know why or what or where they were going to go, they didn\u2019t\ntell us, and while they were watching my father I rushed out down the street to go to a phone and\nphone my uncles to warn them, but a strange man answered the phone so we knew they had also got\nthem. And, then some sort of rumor came about that they had been taken to the railway stations,\nand then all the women rushed to the railway station to see if they could still see their husbands or\nfathers, but we didn\u2019t see our father, but eventually we heard from him that he was in Poland. And\nthey had apparently there was some sort of tug-of-war between the Germans and the Poles because\nthe Poles didn\u2019t want to take them, the Germans wouldn\u2019t let them back, and there was a camp\nwhere they held all these people which was called bonchin(ph) and but my father still had family in\nPoland so he and his two brothers went to the family.",
        "A: We were going to speak to with him on the phone, we were able to speak to him on the phone.\nYes. Well it wasn\u2019t war time yet, you see, it was 38, it was just before Crystal Night actually that\nthey were deported. The 28th of October, Crystal Night was in November so it wasn\u2019t very far\napart.",
        "A: Well, I really got up, we got up the next morning, and you see not living in a Jewish area we\nweren\u2019t so aware as to what had happened. Our shop had gone so really there wasn\u2019t much Jewish\nproperty for them to destroy. But when we heard about it I walked to my Aunt\u2019s house and yes, you\nwere walking through glass. You know once you neared Jewish shops and the synagogue and so on\nthen you could see what had happened. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called Crystal Night, isn\u2019t it? We were\nwalking on glass.",
        "A: First of all we were asked to leave our flat, for a German couple, and strangely enough my\nmother went to court and the judge gave her three months, which was quite unheard of, you know,\nthat he should allow us to stay, and so he gave us three months, and we moved in with my aunt after\nthat whose husband had also been deported. And then my mother started seriously to look around\nfor some place for us to go. Because we had no income. There was no safety anymore. We\nchildren couldn\u2019t go to school. So obviously, rather late, but we knew then that we had to leave,\nbecause you see even the lot of the German people I think didn\u2019t believe that our friends anyway\nthat he could stay in power. And a lot of the Jewish people who had become so much part of the\ncountry and the professional people who held jobs in hospitals and everywhere, nobody could\nbelieve that an intelligent nation could allow in a dictator which in a way wasn\u2019t imposed on them,\nbecause Hindenburg supported him and he really got in by legal means but nobody thought that\nsuch a tyranny could go on but they are, that\u2019s what happened. And so then my mother started\nlooking around and by that time it was very difficult to get a visa to go to any country, and so people\ntook any visa they could get. I know friends of ours went to China and eventually these Cuban\nvisas came up and you had to pay for them with them with foreign currency, which really meant\nyou had to smuggle money out of Germany in order to have dollars to pay for these visas, which my\nmother did, she smuggled money out, and she didn\u2019t even know who it was going to, it was some\nsort of code name, you know she talked to somebody about uncle so and so, I remember that as a\nchild. And then eventually we bought visas with the foreign currency, and which was supposed to\nbe perfectly legal. And then my mother had to arrange a boat to take us across and she got four\npassages on the boat called the St. Louis which was meant to sail from Hamburg on May the 13th,\nwhich it did. And the Germans allowed people to come back into Germany providing they were\nleaving again. It was a sort of transit visa they allowed them. My father applied to come back and\nthe Poles sent the wrong brother back, so my father didn\u2019t make it. And so my father phoned up in\ntears and he told my mother not to go without him, and she must have been a very determined\nwoman because she said \u201cI have to take the children out.\u201d In any case, there was another boat\nleaving after ours, the Orinoco and she couldn\u2019t get four passages on the next boat, but one she\ncould get, so she was determined to take up three of the passages and my father was going to join us\nafterwards on the next boat.",
        "A: [had a sister, I have a sister still, yes.",
        "A: Three of us were going yes. And actually the finalization of the visas didn\u2019t happen until the last\nminute. We were to leave on a Saturday and Friday morning we still hadn\u2019t heard that everything\nwas finalized, so my mother rushed off to sort things out, then she called me on the phone and I\nwent with her, and then on the Friday afternoon we got everything finalized, and we phoned my 12\nyear-old sister and she did all the packing and we left on the Friday night.",
        "A: The visa?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. I just know that she had to pay with it for it with foreign currency and I\nthink they were bought abroad, paid for abroad in the Cuban embassy.",
        "A: Never made it out, no? You know, if you know the story of the St. Louis, when we got to\nHavana, they wouldn\u2019t allow us to land, and the next boat was leaving two weeks later, and when\nthe captain heard that we couldn\u2019t land I think they got as far as Antwerp, they turned back but they\ndidn\u2019t tell the passengers they were turning back, and they ended up back in Germany and then my\nfather had to go back to Poland and we never saw him again.",
        "A: He managed the next boat but he went back to Germany and then eventually to Poland.",
        "A: Yes, well we left on May the 13th, and if you manage to get a hold of the documentary, you will\nsee how efficient the Germans are because they found all the old footage of us getting on, and they\neven found me as a 15 year old amongst all that crowd getting onto the boat. But we left on May\nthe 13th and for us youngsters it was really quite an adventure, because this was a luxury liner, and\nthe captain was a wonderful man. He instructed the crew that we had to be treated like anybody\nelse. We had to pay for the return journey, but nobody really saw anything into that because we all\nfelt the ship was going to come back empty and it was only fair that they were paid for this. And it\nwas an experience to be on a liner where you had a cinema and a ballroom and a swimming pool,\nand all the usual games you have on a boat. Obviously very few of us had ever been on a cruise so\nit was exciting for us youngsters. But my mother never took part in anything. She didn\u2019t worry us,\nyou know. And it must have been an awful thing to leave your place where you\u2019ve lived, and leave\na husband behind who didn\u2019t want you to go. My mother had ten marks, which I don\u2019t know how\nmuch it would have been then, perhaps twenty dollars or something for the three of us, that is all we\nwere allowed to take out. So she must have been terribly worried about the future, you know two\nchildren, twenty dollars, no job, nothing to go back to. And so, but she never worried us at all. And\nduring the first 10 days we really had a very good time until we landed and found that things began\nto go wrong.",
        "A: The main thing is, we saw so many people with shaven heads. And it appears then, we sort of\nfound out they were people let out of concentration camps, they had to sign papers to say they\nwould never return to Germany, they were let out, and these people seemed to take longer to take\npart in the festivities that were going on, and so on. We had our Friday night services, we had a\nportrait of Hitler in the ballroom, but the captain allowed us take it off during the services and then it\nhad to be put back after the service. It\u2019s very difficult for me now to say what I remember as a\nteenager and what I\u2019ve read since, of course, it\u2019s very difficult to separate these things. Because\nthere was also a book written about it, called \u201cThe Voyage of the Damned,\u201d but unfortunately I feel\nit\u2019s a little bit of a soap opera and they made a film of that too. And so I don\u2019t know if I know it\nfrom the book I read or whether I really knew it that there were people watching us. The only thing\nI know is my mother had a cabin on her own and one night she woke up and found somebody\nsearching through things and walking around the cabin. And after that she never slept alone again.\nSo I don\u2019t know how much truth there was in it all, that we were being watched.",
        "A: Not really, except somebody said on the way there that there was another boat coming from\nsomewhere else, and I can\u2019t remember where from, England or somewhere else, and they said, \u201cWe\nreally should hurry and get there before the other boat so that we don\u2019t have to hang about too\nlong.\u201d Now I don\u2019t know if there is any significance in that or not, but for certain we didn\u2019t know\nanything until we got there, and we were even told to get up very early the next morning and had\nour breakfast and we were lined up with all our suitcases ready to get off, and the boat stopped quite\na way outside the harbor. Well, once again we thought that was quite normal, you know, it is\nalways deep enough for the boat to go right into the harbor and we had stopped outside, and the\nCuban police came on and the immigration people, and then suddenly the atmosphere changed and\nwe were told, \u201cnot today, not today, meyeniana(ph) tomorrow, tomorrow,\u201d but tomorrow never\ncame, and then people were getting anxious but nobody ever gave up hope. You know we were so\nnear America we never thought anybody would allow us to go back to Germany. I mean nine\nhundred and odd people that\u2019s really nothing is it , a drop in the ocean.",
        "A: Yes, but they were I think Spaniards and Cubans or something, and one family I remember\nleaving, left because I think somebody paid them a lot of money for them, but I think they were just\nfamily if I remember correctly. But the others I think were people that had that weren\u2019t refugees\nthat had come to holiday or to play in a band or something but I really don\u2019t remember these things.\nAnd one man of course committed suicide and he was left behind. And that I remember very well\nbecause I was standing by the deck and I saw him rushing out of the bathroom with the blood\ndripping down and he ran to the edge and jumped into the water. And one of the sailors actually\njumped after him and rescued him. But even when he was in the rescue launch, he was still trying\nto pull his arteries out and he didn\u2019t want to be saved.",
        "A: Yes, with a razor blade. Because he\u2018d been in a camp and decided he wouldn\u2019t go back, and I\nsuppose people\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t good you know when they got on the boat, their minds must\nhave been very confused anyway, and then to be faced with the problems that we might have had to\nface, he couldn\u2019t put up with.",
        "A: Several days, yes. And then they decided, the Cuban authorities decided, that no boat could stay\nin the harbor for such a length of time and that we should leave the, I think it\u2019s a three mile zone or\nwhatever it is, and just go back and cruise around until more arrangements were made. And I\nbelieve the American Joint(ph) worked very hard for us, and they wanted to pay money for us, but I\nthink it was more a political issue because I think whatever they offered it was decided not to accept\nthe money and not to accept us. Whatever reason they could give for us, I really don\u2019t know, I\nreally only know what I have heard since, so I don\u2019t know what the political issue was that why they\nwouldn\u2019t have us. And then we just went off and cruised along the coast of Miami and Florida and\nthe gun boats came out in case somebody jumped overboard and swam ashore you know, and so.\nAnd eventually when we turned back towards Germany, we still really didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening because we didn\u2019t know which direction we were going in, so for quite a time we were in\na way left in the dark except they had a committee which apparently knew what was going on but\ncertainly we teenagers didn\u2019t know what was going on.",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t involved in the committee, no.",
        "A: Well, she never showed anything, you know. I just know that she never took part in any of the\njournification so obviously she was worried all along, so I really don\u2019t know if she knew any more\nthan we did, but probably she suspected more than we did. Probably had a greater fear than we did.",
        "A: You mean after we couldn\u2019t land, because before that we had a jolly good time, we swam and\nplayed games and went to dances and film shows.",
        "A: Well, then really very few people attended the sort of film shows, and the dances, and all that,\nbecause there was a sort of cloud hanging over us, even though you had hope that you weren\u2019t\ngoing to, that you were going to land somewhere eventually, but obviously it was a worrying time\nbecause you didn\u2019t know what your future held for you.",
        "A: Yes, I made quite a lot of friends but really we didn\u2019t keep it up because a small, a quarter of the\npeople ended up in England, and a lot of those eventually got to America anyway because so many\nof them had quota numbers to get into America at a future date, and so quite a few left during the\nwar even, and I think we were sort of spread around the country, and I in particular was sent away,\nstraightaway two days after we arrived I was sent to a convalescent home by the seaside to scrub\nfloors for them you know, because the only work you were allowed to do was domestic work, so I\nwas sent away straightaway.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Oh no, no, we ended up in England, sorry. Yes, well eventually when we had to go back\ntowards and we knew we were going back towards Germany, as far as I know several other people\ntried to commit suicide, and we had a group of young people checking all the cabins to watch\npeople, and it was a very grim atmosphere then of course. And when we were off the coast of\nEngland suddenly we heard that Belgium, Holland, France, and England were prepared to take a\nquarter each of the people. And obviously a lot of people wanted to go England, because the other\ncountries were to near Germany. And my father obviously knew what was going on because he\nsent us a telegram and said \u201cChoose England.\u201d But really one didn\u2019t have a choice. They decided\nwhere people should go and people\u2019s different nationalities they had different quotas how many\npeople they would take in of each nationality and my mother told me to go and speak to the\nImmigration, English Immigration Officer because I had learned English at school. How good my\nEnglish was I really don\u2019t know, but I did talk to the man and whether that had any influence or not\nI really don\u2019t know. But luckily we ended up in England. But the boat first landed in Belgium, and\nthe people that were staying in Belgium obviously got off and the others were transferred by trains\nto Holland and France, and we were put on a sort of cargo ship and taken to England. And we\u2019ve\nheard since that at the time Gobels(ph) published in the newspapers you see nobody wants\nsamiva(ph) at least we are building camps for them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, not quite. We stayed together for the first few days, because the Jewish Committee, 1t was\nin London, it was Woben(ph) House, gave people, put people into the hotel for the first week, but I\nafter three days we were sent away immediately. My sister was 13 and she went to school.",
        "A: It was seaside place called Broadstairs(ph). It was a convalescent home actually for Jewish\nrefugees. And, but, the matron of the convalescent home was not Jewish, and there were three of us\nactually and we were always hungry. The didn\u2019t feed us very well.",
        "A: Yes, in fact we came to England on the 19th of June I think, because my sister\u2019s birthday is on\nthe 18th and we still had that on the boat. Yes, that was towards the end of June then, yes, yes, and I\nstayed there until September and then I met a family on the beach and they asked me if I would\ncome and look after their children for them, of 6 and 11, and I was getting in English money, 25\np(ph) a week and they were offering me a pound a week or something, and so I obviously accepted,\nended with going back to London so I accepted that job and the children were as I said six and a half\nand 11, and I was 15, and they asked me to do the cooking and the cleaning, and if the children\ncouldn\u2019t go to school they asked me to write the letters to teachers, so somebody must have had\ngreat fun reading my writing, but still.",
        "A: My mother eventually found work with some...[end of side one]. So, at what point do you want\nme to start?",
        "A: Yes, I was working for a family then and then of course the war broke out, and I was in London\nand we, at one stage, went and slept in the underground stations to protect ourselves because of the\nbombing. But I stayed with that family for about six months and once war broke out, we were\nallowed to do war work, and so then my sister had been evacuated by then, but my mother and I\nfound rooms and we lived together and I went to work making soldiers uniforms and gunpowder\nbags, and so on.",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t say that. Nash(ph), actually Nash(ph) yes. It was an English family Nash(ph) yes,\nchanged from Nashinski(ph) , yes.",
        "A: My mother and then eventually my sister came back from her evacuation too, yes. She went to a\ndressmaking school actually and then had to find a job. And I was working, but in 1943 I got\nmarried and moved out again, I got married at 19 and a half.",
        "A: How did that come about? I went to a Czech garden party with a man actually who has since\nbecame an actor, his name was Herbert Long, but he wasn\u2019t an actor in the days I knew him, he\nplayed in the Pink Panther films, but you won\u2019t remember that you are too young. But, and my\nhusband asked me to, well, this man asked me to dance, and then saw me home afterwards and told\nme that if I was still going out with him two months later I would marry him and that was it. And\nmy husband was 21 and I was 19 and a half but he had no family. He came from Poland and he was\nalone so possibly that\u2019s the reason he was in such a hurry.",
        "A: I was married, yes. And then my husband decided perhaps he should go to university, and so he\ndidn\u2019t go to university until after we were married.",
        "A: For a period, but the university he went to was in Sheffield, and so we moved to Sheffield for\nfour years until he got his degree.",
        "A: Yes, we had our bombings and hiding in shelters, and eventually I think a lot of people gave up\nand just took their chances. And of course we had the blackout. It was very difficult to find your\nway around because in those days we still had these famous London fogs that you only see in\nSherlock Holmes films nowadays and I can remember ending up in somebody else\u2019s yard at the\nback of the house because it really was quite impossible to see and find your way around. On the\nother hand one felt very, very safe. You know you\u2019d walk around without being able to see\nanybody and people would talk to you and as a young girl, you never felt afraid to walk about.",
        "A: Well one didn\u2019t really know how horrible it all was, you know. And we still heard from my\nfather for some time. But I\u2019d just like to back when we first came to England. My mother couldn\u2019t\nspeak English so she went to the East end of London, which was the Jewish part in those days, and\nshe could speak Yiddish, and she went from place to place, from shop to shop, and asked somebody\nif they could guarantee for my father to come out, because he could come if you had somebody that\nwould guarantee for you, and in fact she found somebody who offered him a job, and his papers\nwere being processed and the war broke out, so he lost his second chance there. So I\u2019m only saying\nthat just to add again what a brave woman my mother was, making a decision for us to leave\nwithout him with two children and very little money, and then she immediately set about trying to\nget him out, and so she was really a very active woman because we relied a lot on her before we left\nGermany too because when we had our business eventually wholesalers wouldn\u2019t deliver to Jewish\nshops, so my mother used to get up at 5:00 in the morning and go to the markets and bring in the\neggs and the butter so we could still sell the stuff in the, in the shop. So she really was a very, very\nstrong, active woman. But now getting back to after the war started, we heard from my father until\nabout 1940, because we had family in Romania and in Switzerland so he could send the mail via\nthese two addresses. Just recently I came across a postcard from him actually and which I think\nhistorically is quite interesting because he gives his address in Poland, which was, the town was\nGesshue(ph) and it says \u201cGermany\u201d and in brackets \u201cFormally Poland.\u201d So in effect you see once\nthe Germans invaded Poland the address had to be Germany. It is interesting, isn\u2019t it? Until I\nlooked through all the stuff my mother left behind, I didn\u2019t realize how really historically interesting\nthat must be that they had to write their address \u201c\u201cGermany,\u201d and in brackets \u201cFormally Poland.\u201d",
        "A: There were only a few lines actually, we haven\u2019t heard for such a long time, are you well, I\u2019m\nsorry you have to work so hard, write, and you know that\u2019s just these few lines. And my husband\nactually he died three years ago but before that went back to Poland because apparently they have\nquite a few archives there too, to see if he could find out what happened to my family, but they had\nrecords of people who died a natural death, but not records of people who were eventually sent\naway or deported so we never found out what happened.",
        "A: Correspondence stopped yes. And of course the Red Cross made all sorts of inquiries so you\nknow nobody turned up after the war, so one knew that they had gone.",
        "A: Yes well, I must have spoken quite a lot, because I was sent out to do the shopping, and of\ncourse I was in that convalescent home, and the matron that ran it only spoke English, and I think I\nprobably learned quite a lot looking after the children too. So, I seemed to have, as I say, learned it\nvery quickly, because I can remember after I got married being ill, and the doctors saying to my\nhusband, \u201cThat\u2019s a real Londoner you\u2019ve got there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d So I must have lost my accent fairly\nquickly too.",
        "A: Yes, for me it was, yes, yes.",
        "A: No, no, we weren\u2019t living in the East end, at one time we were living in Klisl(ph) Park, and then\neventually we had a flat in West Hampstead. Actually only about a year before I got married we\ntook on that flat.",
        "A: Well, not an awful lot. We had Jewish friends and I had one particular friend from the boat\nactually, who eventually emigrated to Australia and I am still in touch with her and I even went to\nsee her in Australia, and some of the people from the boat, although I hadn\u2019t remembered them but\nwhen we had this reunion to make the documentary, actually they only had nine of us because that\u2019s\nall they could afford, three people from England and six from America and three of the six, I am\ngoing to see on this trip.",
        "A: We went to Sheffield for my husband to do his studies. And he did a degree in glass\ntechnology(ph) which is an unusual subject, but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought\nhis parents over to England because they had, in fact, they lived in Krakoff(ph) and as the Germans\nmarched in they marched out towards the Russian side and eventually the Russians sent them right\ndeep into Russia and although they had an awful war, there were no worse off than of the Russians\nbecause nobody had any food, so they were discriminated against where they were and they came\nback to Krakoff(ph) right after the war, and then we brought them over to England and they always\nsaid they had been the happiest years of their lives. So that was great.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I mean we lead perfectly normal lives. We had our first child in 1950, a daughter who\nlives in California, and we had two more children, one of them we lost he died at the age of 18, he\nhad polio and eventually ended up in a car accident in an invalid car, and then I have a son in\nManchester in England and I have now left London to live near him since I lost my husband.",
        "A: Well, I think perhaps everything that is of interest I have told you because once I got married we\nlead a fairly ordinary life, perhaps not so ordinary as far as people are concerned now because we\nbrought his parents over, we kept them for awhile, and it isn\u2019t often that the children are responsible\nfor parents, it is normally the other way around. But it was such a normal thing in those days. You\nnever felt that you had been hard done by or you did more than you should have done. I think we\noften felt very sad about my mother. You don\u2019t realize until it happens to you. My mother had 18\nyears of married life and when we were youngsters we thought that was a long time, but obviously\nit isn\u2019t a long time. And so she really had a very hard time. We often felt sorry for her, but she was\nnever a miserable person, and all she said was \u201cI just want to see my daughters married,\u201d and when\nshe saw her daughters married, \u201cI just want to see my grandchildren,\u201d you know, so really there\u2019s\nalways people always hope for more. And then eventually she even saw her great-grandchildren so\nthat was great.",
        "A: She died in her 91st year, so really...and dearly loved by everybody. Her sons-in-law thought\nshe wonderful because she never interfered. And so we really had a very nice family life, yes.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s something that I think is horrendous, but it\u2019s quite difficult to comprehend even though\nyou know it has all happened. And I must say that I watch all the films and things and people\nalways say to me \u201cWhy do you punish yourself like that?\u201d And I just feel that at least I must\nexperience second-hand what these people went through. I think it\u2019s a cowardly attitude to say, \u201cTI\ncan\u2019t watch these things\u201d because if my family could go through it at least I should know and get\nupset by what they\u2019ve been through. But everybody has to deal with things in their own way, I\nsuppose. But not to want to know, I think, is really denying the fact that these people existed and\nwhat happened to them. Well I hope you feel happy with what I\u2019ve told you.",
        "A: Yes, but do you feel you\u2019ve had sufficiently out of this interview, or did you want to ask me any\nquestions?",
        "A: Yes, but when people have talked to me before I always felt I had to be honest about the fact that\nyou cannot really know exactly what you have experienced or what you remember from your\nexperience or what you\u2019ve read since. And I think perhaps everybody must feel that difficulty.",
        "A: Well, thank you.\n"
