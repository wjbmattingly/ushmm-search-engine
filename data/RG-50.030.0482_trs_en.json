        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Helen Bamber, conducted\nby Vera Frankel on December 28\", 2003, in London. This is tape number one, side A. Helen\nBamber, tell me about your background first of all, where you grew up and the family you grew\nup in.",
        "Answer: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in North London. My father was born in\nAmerica. My mother was born in the UK, in England, of course, as it was then. Their parents\ncame from Poland and Russia respectively. Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually\nborn, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me,\nOswiecim, Auschwitz. And that sent shivers down our spine many years later. Now, it wasn\u2019t a\nhappy household. My father was an accountant. He was a very obsessional man, and during most\nof my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925. So I grew up in the years of\nunemployment, dole queues, and the rise of fascism. And I think this combination absorbed my\nfather completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary. He could see, I believe, what\nwas going to happen in Europe. He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of\nother languages, and I\u2019ve never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was\nquite simply educated in this country, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages\nhe did, and how he could be bilingual in German. I never understood that, and I don\u2019t now, but\nhe was. So, as an only child, in a house in north London, with diminishing financial resources, as\nmy father\u2019s activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave Nazi Germany\nbecame more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active. And as I was exposed to\nhis version of events, his -- his horror of fascism, his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and\nindeed, in England where we -- I mean, I was frequently aware of Mosely\u2019s fascists marching\nthrough north London, and the east end of London. I\u2019m losing my thread, but what I\u2019m trying to\ndo is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a working class\narea, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous house to something very modest. Was a -\n-a--akind of house of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might\nhappen in the future. My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from Germany, which\nhe would translate. So that as a young child, I -- I was exposed to quite a lot of my father\u2019s\nunderstanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own. N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all\nthis by -- and it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h --\nand as is always the case, she actually couldn\u2019t face the possibility of what might happen. She\nbegan to disengage as much as she could. As my father\u2019s activities became, as I said earlier,\nmore -- more active, there were refugees from Germany who came to our house, en route\nperhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my house for some days, weeks, and -- and\nas a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been\nTB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was\nbedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood. And they -- there were -- people who\ncame and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my bed and talk to me, but they\nwouldn\u2019t talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and 1 --\nyo-you know, celebration. It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened\nin Germany. And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much.\nI found him pompous, although he played beautifully. And he came and sat on my bed\nfrequently. But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood. He said to\nme, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to be ill like this. If you want to, you can get out of bed when I\nleave this room, and you can walk round the room, touch all the furniture, and get back into bed,\nand say to yourself, I am now in control of myself.\u201d Now, I disliked him more than ever when he\nsaid this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues. But I did\nexactly what he said. I got up and I walked round the room, and I touched everything, and I said\nto myself. \u201cI can make changes, I can be in control.\u201d I wasn\u2019t very confident, but I said it. And I\ndon\u2019t know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me.",
        "Q: Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father\u2019s outlook on life\ninfluenced your personality, and your thinking?",
        "A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don\u2019t want to magnify it. I was\nvery moved by my father. I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair\nlater on, when the Holocaust came. But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother\u2019s\nsocial skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the piano, and her desire for me to be\nsomehow -- I don\u2019t know, something very special. Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families.\nBut it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really. Later they divorced; when\nI was in my late teens, they divorced. But it was an unhappy household, and I\u2019m not sure that I --\nI mean, I think I had a good role model for my future in human rights. I\u2019m not sure that I had a\ngood role model in terms of relationships, and 1n terms of parenting. I learned, though, as a -- as\nan only child in an unhappy household, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I\nlearned how to compromise. And these, I think, are skills I have. And that comes not only from\nlater experience, but I learned it in the family home.",
        "Q: You -- you spent your teenage years, I believe, in London during the war. Tell me about what\nthat experience was like, and -- and how you think now, looking back, that it affected you.",
        "A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war. What can I say\nabout it? In some ways, it was almost -- it\u2019s crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear\nof be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans\ncame, specially chosen for annihilation. So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing\nincident, when I was fire watching in central London, when central London was terribly bombed,\nand was buried, albeit it -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn\u2019t\nhurt. I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to\ngo downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a solicitor\u2019s office, and standing\non some steps, going down to the basement where all the documents were kept with little bits of\npink ribbon tying them up. And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I\nstood on the top step, the steps collapsed under me. And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from\nthat time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my\nchances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn\u2019t being particularly chosen at that\nparticular time. And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it\u2019s reliefs for me, although it killed, in\nanother bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was\nconsiderably left wing. Did a lot of work in the east end of London, working with the\nCommunists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely\u2019s\nfascists. And she was involved in the much glorified battle of Cable Street, which is an incident\nwhere when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of\nthe east end brought out all their furniture, their -- their pianos, their -- their tables, their kitchen\nequipment, and they blocked the roads of the east end. And for me, with a father who was\ngrowing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to\nme. It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn\u2019t succeed ultimately\nin making a stand, in making a statement. So my aunt was another very strong influence in my\nlife because she represented anything but despair. She was vigorous, she was sexy. She had the\nstrangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter. She was a fascinating, vigorous,\nlovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also\ndoing these fantastic things. An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my\nlife, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fianc\u00e9, someone I think she\nmight have married, were killed when the Caf\u00e9 de Paris had a direct hit.",
        "Q: Caf\u00e9 de Paris in London?",
        "A: The caf\u00e9 de p -- ki -- the Caf\u00e9 de P-Paris was a very famous caf\u00e9 for dancing, many soldiers\nand people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive,\nbut -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe. I don\u2019t know why people talk about something\nbeing absolutely safe. It had a direct hit. Her body was never found, and I remember going with\nmy mother to try and identify various objects that were lined up somewhere in the middle of\nLondon where people queued and looked at these objects. Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing.",
        "Q: You were brought up with this kind of terrible fear of what might happen to the Jews of\nEurope. When did you actually begin to discover, and to understand what was going on?",
        "A: I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in\n-- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective.\nHe had read men ka -- \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d he had read other documents. The information actually\nwas there for anyone who wanted to know it. Members of parliament denied all knowledge of\nconcentration camps, and people -- I think including my father, but I\u2019m not sure about this -- did\nlobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don\u2019t think that -\n- that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation. And maybe for\nother reasons as well. So I always knew, I always knew about the concentration camps. It was no\nsecret in my house that people were being taken to concentration camps and murdered. We\nweren\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t always know -- now when I look back, it\u2019s difficult to be accurate. Whether\nthe details were known, I\u2019m not su -- to me, I\u2019m not sure, but certainly the word concentration\ncamps, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my household. So\nit wasn\u2019t a stranger to me.",
        "Q: What years are we talking about here?",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war\nyears. The forties. The 1941, \u201942, \u201943, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and\nLondon was being bombed, my father was talking about concentration camps.",
        "Q: I believe there was an exhibition of photographs in London. An exhibition of photographs\nfrom the camps which had a very profound impact on you. Can you recall how old you were\nwhen you went to see that exhibition and what -- what stayed in your mind from that?",
        "A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that\u2019s right, there was an\nexhibition of photographs that was shown in London. It wasn\u2019t the photographs that shocked me\nso much as the attitude of people. And I think that if I\u2019m not mistaken, that the photographs were\ndiscontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people\u2019s reactions.\nNow, I\u2019m not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want\nto believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn\u2019t\nreally -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and\nrationing, and everything else. And to bring home to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that --\nto that extent, I think either didn\u2019t move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it\ndidn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with\nreal under -- I-let\u2019s say how difficult 1t was for anyone to understand what really happened. It\nwasn\u2019t the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to Germany at the end\nof the war. I think that I\u2019d started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I\u2019m -- and in --\nit\u2019s very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the\nmore you think about it, you begin to understand your motives. People often ask me why did I\nwant to go to the camps, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me\nwant to go and to work for the survivors. And I think it really, now talking today, I think it\nwasn\u2019t only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas\neverybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the --\nthe catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the\nconcentration camps, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war,\nI think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing. He also had his own personal reasons\nfor -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad. But I think it was also my aunt, because my\naunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father. And her belief was you must do\nsomething, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to. And so I suppose it was\nmy father\u2019s knowledge, and my aunt\u2019s kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do\nsomething, make a statement, however -- even if you\u2019re waving your arms and nobody\u2019s\nwatching, do it, was what she was about. I think that\u2019s really what influenced me.",
        "Q: Do you remember actually taking this decision? And how old were you at the time?",
        "A: I found an organization called the Jewish Relief Unit, that was in formation before the end of\nthe war. I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they\nannounced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they\u2019d consider me. And I joined the\nrelief unit in the hope that I would be able to go.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Could you tell me what the unit consisted of, who organized it,\nhow it was run, how big it was?",
        "A: The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small office near Woburn House in\nthat square, Woburn Square, or Ensley Place I think was it\u2019s name. It was a -- a house on a\ncorner, and it consisted of an office with about six or seven people in it. It was financed, I think,\nby the -- now I\u2019m not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot\nremember. This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded. I do have a\nbook about it, but I don\u2019t read the book, and I\u2019m not sure why. But anyway, there is a lot of\ninformation about the funding of this organization. And there were people being trained to go.\nAnd these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to\ngo, as far as I know. And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then\nliving with my mother; my father was separated, as I said. And this was going to be quite a\ndifficult issue. I remember sitting in Saint James\u2019s Park, and watching the ducks where I\u2019d met\nmy father, and I said to him, \u201cI -- I want to go to Germany.\u201d And he didn\u2019t really say very much.\nHe said, \u201cWell, you must be sure you want to go, and you\u2019l|l have to be safe and careful.\u201d Which\nhadn\u2019t actually occurred to me at the time, about being safe. Being careful, yes. But he -- he\ndidn\u2019t express great enthusiasm or dismay or surprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast.\nAnd her dreams of what she had expected of me for the future began to disappear to some extent,\nfor her. She saw me taking a path that she really didn\u2019t like, and I suppose as a mother now it\nwas, looking back, it must have been hard for her. But I was very determined to go. And so I\ncontinued to -- to train, to -- to be exposed to a psychologist who in pri -- in small intimate\nsessions would -- individual sessions would ask you questions, but also in group sessions. And I\nsuppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at the time, who -- not all Jewish by the way, and I\nthink that\u2019s important to know. There were several Quakers, people who felt very strongly about\nwhat had happened, who wanted to -- who offered their -- their services. And so that\u2019s what I\ndid, and we went on various training courses, to a kibbutz somewhere in England, in Wiltshire, I\nbelieve, where we undertook various training in map reading and first aid, and -- but I do\nremember -- I do remember one session where we sat in a group and I think it was the\npsychologist asked everyone what they felt they expected to find, and how they would deal with\nthe very impossible situations, and how they would deal with people who they cou -- who felt --\nwho didn\u2019t want to be helped, or were past helping. And I remember searching my -- my th-\nthoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what is the answer to that, faced with a lot of\npeople who you can\u2019t help. And I remember saying that maybe one has to accept that there will\nbe people you can\u2019t save. And maybe if there are children and younger people there, we have to\nput our energies into trying to help them. And that maybe -- this now sounds all rather simplistic,\nbut and maybe if -- if people see the energy going into the young and the children, that would be\nsome compensation for them. I don\u2019t think it was such a bad idea now, looking back, because\nthere were many people that couldn\u2019t be helped. Anyway, that was -- that was what I said at the\ntime.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. Tell me a little bit more\nabout the actual training process, and the extent to which you were really prepared mentally and\nphysically for what you were about to find.",
        "A: Well, I-looking at how people are prepared today, say in aid agencies, which still leaves a lot\nto be desired, I\u2019m not sure that we really were prepared so well. It was a disparate group of -- o-\nof volunteers. There were nurses, there were people with a variety of skills at the time. And --\nbut I can\u2019t remember sitting down and really -- th-th-there was just that one discussion we had in\nwhich we were asked to face the possibility of not being able to help everyone, not being able to\nsave everyone. It is important because it stayed in my mind and it -- it\u2019s the situation that I\u2019m\nfaced with every day of my life now. And it\u2019s always hard, it\u2019s always hard and it should always\nbe hard. But it has to be there, that acceptance that you can\u2019t save everyone. But it\u2019s so hard. We\nwent to various -- as I said, we went to this kibbutz, and I remember I drove with somebody in a\nvan, and the idea was that we had to follow the map and find our own way there. And map\nreading and finding our way around with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the\nprovisions to be given. On the -- on the question of driving, and map reading, and knowing how\nto distribute the wherewithal, food, or provisions and so on. I don\u2019t really remember, even with\nthe help of the psychologist, a great deal of help about how we would feel, faced with what we\nwere going to face, which wasn\u2019t only about a d -- a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every\nsense of the word. Suffering from malnutrition, suffering from loss, some behaving as if they\nwere quite mad, all of that. But it was also that we were going to a country that was in rubble,\nand starving. And I certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for the fact -- I\u2019d hardened all these years my heart\nagainst the German people. I\u2019d grown up with a dislike and fear of the Germans. And when I was\non the train going out, on my own, with all my luggage and baggage and God knows what -- I\nmean, what a performance that was, I remember seeing starving German children standing along\nthe railway line, holding out their hands. And I was traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and\neverybody threw out their bread and whatever they had with them to the starving children. Now\nthat I wasn\u2019t prepared for, and that was hard too, because these were children, these were\ninnocent children. And that brought a conflict that I hadn\u2019t -- or an understanding that I hadn\u2019t\nexpected to find in myself. And I learned that the very first moment I traveled. So there were\nmany things one wasn\u2019t prepared for. One wasn\u2019t prepared for the devastated cities. No, we\nweren\u2019t prepared, but maybe there was no way to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I\nthink, how catastrophic was the scene that we were t-to find eventually.",
        "Q: Let me take you back a little bit. Can you tell me how you were kitted out? What you looked\nlike and actually the journey? How does an 18 year old go make her way across half of Europe\nand end up where? I don\u2019t know what your destination was, what had you been told?",
        "A: My journey remains really a bit of a mystery to me myself. I was then just 20 by the way,\nwhen I went. I think I was -- have to be very careful about this, but I think I just -- I was just 20\nyears old. And I had uniforms, we all had. We had officer\u2019s uniform, we had officer\u2019s rank. And\nan ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear. I don\u2019t know what you call it now. It\u2019s awful that I\ndon\u2019t, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordinary, and I traveled with the yellow star on my\nshoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we had elected to do. And that in itself was an\nundertaking. So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that\nwas like a mobile bath, or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift. And a bedroll\nand all kinds of -- the bedroll was very important later on, by the way. The -- the mobile bath, I\nnever knew it\u2019s -- what it was intended to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty\nunderwear in it because I could sort of snap it together when anybody came into the room. You\nknow, it was one of those things, it sort of opened out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I\ndon\u2019t know, it was a kind of ghastly thing. But it was very good for underwear and you could\nsmack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see. So that\u2019s what I\ndid with that. And there was all kinds of equipment that one didn\u2019t actually need. I think the\nbedroll was very important. So I was in uniform, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m-my khaki,\nmy ghastly shoes and navy blue underwear and -- and the yellow star. And why I traveled on my\nown I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed\nto go. There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I\ndidn\u2019t meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist\nparty, who was not allowed to go. Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew\nand loved her. So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear\nby the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the\nformer concentration camps, or in Holland, or in Greece were somehow either a provocation or a\ndifficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control. Whatever it was, it was difficult. And so\neverybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of\nUNRRA, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government. At least we\nwere in the British zone, that means to say those of us who went to Germany. I had to go -- I\nmean, my final destination was a small village called Eilshausen, which I -- I kept spelling in my\nhead all the time, E-i-l-s. Eilshausen. It was difficult for me. I\u2019d spoke some German by the way,\nbecause I\u2019d learned from my father enough German to get by. And the worst of all was that I\nwent on a train from Victoria -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I\u2019m not\nvery tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me.\nBut of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow\nstar. So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself. Why one was going, what\none was doing. And it was the beginning 1n a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that\nwas always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what\nI\u2019m doing for asylum seekers and refugees. And so I -- I'd already begun then to explain what I\nwas doing with the yellow star on my shoulder. [tape break] Where am I?",
        "Q: With the yellow star on your shoulder --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- you had to explain --",
        "A: I had to explain myself to people as to why I was wearing the yellow star. And people were\ntolerant, the soldiers were good. But when I got to Calais, there was a hold up. The trains to\nGermany th -- were held up. I can\u2019t remember why, whether is was overcrowding. It was quite a\nprecarious journey eventually when I did get on the train because of the bridges, and the\ncrossings. Bridges was dangerous and we all had to stand on one side of the train in order to give\nbalance, which was a bit nerve-wracking.",
        "Q: How do you mean? Can you explain?",
        "A: Well, yes, but I haven\u2019t quite got to Calais yet, because I was stuck. Let me go back to Calais.\nI was stuck in Calais for a week, and we lived -- I never took my clothes off 1-in that week, and\nwe stayed in -- oh, what are those huts called?",
        "Q: Nissen?",
        "A: Nissen huts, yes, in kind of dormitories on paliasis and so on. And it was -- it was very\nprimitive, and I remember wandering round Calais all on my own and feeling so alone, as I\u2019ve\nnever felt in my life before. I hadn\u2019t been out of England before, which is strange in this day and\nage, but I had never been out of England. And so this was the first time I\u2019d been out. And I was\nvery alone. Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the train. And I remember\nsomething quite awful about this train because it would always stop at various places which were\nnot a station. I mean, in other words I couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t -- you had no platform, you had to\nget off the train, so to speak, without a platform, in order to go to wherever you were going to be\nfed on the way, which again was a kind of Nissen hut, specially prepared for the soldiers en\nroute. And you would sit at a long table and -- and be fed. And I had the utmost difficulty with\nmy height, in being able to mount this train. And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things\nthat preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about\nthe seriousness of my task, but how in heaven\u2019s name I was going to get up and down this train\nwithout making a complete idiot of myself. And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from\nbehind. But the train ricketed along, and there was one bridge that we crossed when we were in\nGermany, when the German guard, or person on the train came through carrying a lantern.\nAchtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the train so that we actually balanced\nit properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don\u2019t know, that maybe the\ntrain would topple over. Whatever it was, that\u2019s what we all did. And then there were the\nchildren on the way. And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so\nterrified that I would not find myself at this tiny village -- no, it wasn\u2019t Eilshausen, do forgive\nme, Eilshausen was my final destination. The station I had to get out at was Badounhausen.\nBadenhausen, which was a base for British soldiers. And I had to find my way from\nBadenhausen, which was quite a long way, to Eilshausen, which was the headquarters of our\nunit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt -- a former captain in the British army, and who was then the\ndirector of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up our headquarters in the village. And because of the\nfact that I had taken a secretarial course at some stage, and was quite proficient in shorthand and\ntyping, I was for the moment, to be his assistant. And so that was my route, Badenhausen and\nthen on to Eilshausen. I had no idea how I was going to get to Eilshausen. Well eventually I\nmanaged to get out of the station, and I\u2019Il never forget it, it was an extraordinary sensation. I was\nin Germany, I was on a German station all on my own, with all my stuff. And I remember\nwalking down the steps and walking into the street. And I remember hearing German, seeing\nGerman lettering, an-and this somehow German shops and the names of things in German, and\nGerman voices, and as -- a terrible sense of panic. And it was the -- didn\u2019t -- doesn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nhappen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen. And I remember standing there\nand thinking, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know, \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d I\u2019m in the middle of Germany -- it isn\u2019t\nthe middle of Germany, but you know -- I\u2019m in Germany, and I\u2019m with all this stuff. And I\nactually had to get the things down in -- in dribs and drabs. I think somebody helped me because\nI couldn\u2019t carry all the stuff down the steps in one go. I think somebody did help me, and I was\nstanding there. A British officer came up in a car. And of course, this is what happens, and you\nlearn this in post-war situations. There is a kind of help that doesn\u2019t normally exist that you --\nyou suddenly get used to. He drove up and he said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d And I said, \u201cI -- I\nhave to get to Eilshausen.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere the devil is that?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cWell get in the car and I\u2019Il take you to my head -- my HQ, and -- and we\u2019|l try and find out\nwhere Eilshausen 1s.\u201d So I went with him to his HQ in Badenhausen. And you know, I can\u2019t\nremember whether I ate -- I can remember cleaning up, I do remember that. I remember there\nwas some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit. I must have been filthy\nbecause the week in Calais, it was not the most hygienic. And I felt an awful wreck, I remember\nthat. And eventually -- but I don\u2019t remember eating anything at all, except on the train. And then\nhe came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in British war films now,\non a Sunday. You know, very elegant, very beautiful, very well spoken. And he said, \u201cLook, I --\nI\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve found a -- I\u2019ve found somebody who -- we found Eilshausen, it\u2019s a small village, Pll\nget you there.\u201d I\u2019m still conscious of the yellow star. I was very grateful that somehow -- you\nknow, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star\ngoing to do for us out there? Was it going to open doors, was it going to bring hostility? But I\u2019d\nexplained to him what we were about, and he took it perfectly in his stride. And they found a\ndriver for me, and finding a driver and finding a truck in those days was hard work. So I had to\nwait quite a long time, and then I was taken to Eilshausen. And I remember when I got to\nEilshausen, which is a tiny, little village, and I met with Henry Lunzer, and I think he -- he and I\nat that time, at that moment, were the only people there, although some British officers were\ncoming over that evening for whatever, I don\u2019t know what it was. And he was in -- we were in a\ncommandeered house. It was the house of the local Nazi, and that was the kind of way things\nwere done there, that people were billeted in the houses of the former Nazis. And the former\nNazi would have been Nazi leader, I don\u2019t know whether he was imprisoned or whatever the\nsituation was for him. But certainly some of his staff was still around, and I was very conscious\nof that.",
        "Q: Did you have any encounters with them, or --",
        "A: Oh, I always had encounters with them. I always had encounters with them. I -- I -- my work\ndeveloped whilst I was in -- in Germany, between two camps and the headquarters. One camp\nwas Belsen. The other camp was Kownitz, where I did a great deal of work, probably more than\nI did in Belsen, and Eilshausen, the vil -- the -- the center itself. And it -- it was there, in the\nmain, that I had encounters with the local Germans, although I did have a very angry encounter\nwith somebody once later on, much later on, when I was taking somebody from ORT, the\nAmerican organization, well known, of course, in America, to -- to Belsen. Shall I just tell that\nstory now?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: We -- one of the things -- and you see, the context is always so difficult, why with me I don\u2019t\nknow, but I had to -- I was in Celle, C-e-double |-e, which is a very beautiful, medieval town -- I\nthink it\u2019s medieval town, not so far from Belsen. And it was my job to remain there, and to escort\nthis Am-American woman who had come -- I think it was ORT, and I was to take her to Belsen.\nAnd as we were eating in the -- the mess, the officer\u2019s mess with other soldiers, and I was talking\nabout Belsen, and this German waitress sort of said very arrogantly in Germany -- and I don\u2019t\nknow why there\u2019s all this discussion about Belsen, we didn\u2019t know anything about the camp. We\nnev -- we didn\u2019t know that there was a camp -- we don\u2019t know what all this talk about Belsen 1s.\nBut she was extremely arrogant, and for the first and only time in my life, I stood up and I was\ngoing to hit her. And I was going to hit her very, very hard. And it was only when the -- the p --\nthe person from ORT could see what I was d -- about to do, that she restrained me, but I -- I have\nnever since felt such violent rage as I felt for that woman. And I do -- I can, amongst all the other\nthings I understand, and I preach about tolerance, about this, about that, I can understand violent\nrage in such situations, because I was out of control, totally. But these servants that we had in\nEilshausen, were German. There was Frau Shermburg and her daughter, who\u2019d come from\neastern German -- Germany, who declared frequently that they\u2019d been raped. Frau Shermburg\nwas the wife of a doctor who\u2019d been killed, and her son had been killed in the war. Her daughter\nwas a nurse.",
        "Q: And what was there role exactly, at Eilshausen?",
        "A: Their role was to provi -- was to cook and help us manage the house. We were very, very --\nwhat\u2019s the word I want? Very correct. We -- Henry Lunzer had been an officer in the British\narmy. He maintained good standards of behavior within the house. Nothing should be broken,\nnothing should be taken that was not ours. If it was broken it had to be recorded as having been\nbroken. We were to be mindful and careful of everything. And Frau Shermburg and her daughter\ncooked and managed the house for us. There was people that came in and dealt with the laundry,\nbecause by the time other people joined us -- I suppose I must have been one of the first, really,\nto go out to Eilshausen because other people joined us later. Harry git -- Grojinsky from the\nGrojinsky bakers came, and he was the officer for provisions and storekee -- stores. And so, as\npeople came, laundry and other things needed to be in place, and a -- and as -- and a group of\nabout I think at least seven or eight drivers, with trucks -- because that was the only way we\ncould manage to move around Germany obviously, there was no transport provided.",
        "Q: So you were all billeted in this Nazi\u2019s house?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you were looked after by this --",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say looked after, she -- Frau Shermburg was there to -- to cook, and -- but\nshe was treated well, and I -- and she was billeted -- she wasn\u2019t living in the house, she lived in\nthe village. But I remember there was one scene, a very ugly scene, where she told me that they\nwere being attacked on the way home, for being -- for working with us at the Jewish relief unit.\nAnd she said would somebody escort her. And one of the men in the -- in the unit escorted her,\none of the tall men escorted her -- them, back to their billet. But there was one scene where a\ngroup of very angry people --",
        "Q: From the village?",
        "A: From the village. They were angry, I think they were drunk. They were very noisy, and they\nwere carrying sticks, and they came to the house outside, and they made a terrible din. And Frau\nShermburg was -- she said these are the peop -- these are people who di -- are going to hurt us if\nwe go. And I, at that time, had been befriended by -- this was much later in my experience there,\nI'd been befriended by somebody from the Jewish Brigade, and I did quite a lot of work with\nhim in Kownitz camp. And he had said to me on one occasion -- he taught me many things, he\ntaught me for example, how to wake up at a certain time, which was my difficulty. I was very\nyoung, and I had difficulty waking up. And he told me that you can wake up any time you say\nyou want to wake up, you can do it. So he taught me that, so that I wasn\u2019t late for things. And --\nbut he also said to me amongst many other lessons, if you meet th -- a kind of -- in a -- a situation\nin which you\u2019re isolated, and a lot of people are at the front door, or wha -- a-angry, don\u2019t come\nout in a posse -- he didn\u2019t use that word, but don\u2019t come out in a group, one of you goes out, only\none. And on this occasion, I think because -- I don\u2019t know whether we were short of people, or\nwhether because I am so short and small, and was quite small -- slender at the time -- not now,\nbut then, I -- I went out, and I opened the door, and I stood by this -- in front of them, without\nsaying anything, with nothing in my hands. And we just looked at each other, and then they\nslunk away. But it was a very important lesson to me. It may not have worked. It could -- it need\nnot have worked. They could have done anything, but they didn\u2019t. And it -- on this occasion it\nworked.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber. To take you back again a\nlittle step, what kind of an area was Eilshausen in, and what did it look like?",
        "A: Eilshausen was in Westphalia, some distance from Hanover, I should think about 20\nkilometers, maybe less. It is -- 1t was a very beautiful village. Not so much the village itself,\nbecause some of the houses were modern, you know, spacious, fantastic houses in their own\ngrounds, with a laundry room and you name it. But the walks were brilliant. The woods were\nlovely and we would often walk in the woods. And there was a woman called Frau Mometchka\nwho was German, who had married a Jew, and who died in the concentration camp, her husband\ndid. And she really belonged nowhere. Because of her background she could not live within the\nGerman community. And oh -- because of -- she didn\u2019t quite belong in the house. She was a very\neducated, elegant -- it\u2019s very difficult to be elegant in those circumstances, but very dignified\nwoman in her 60\u2019s, I would think. Tall, upright, spoke a beautiful German, played the piano\nbeautifully, used to play for us. How she came to us I do not know. She was there one day when\nI came back from a mission. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d been. I got to know her very well, she was\nvery fond of me, we used to walk in the woods together. It was beautiful, absolutely -- absolutely\nlovely, with streams, woods, hills. Lovely place. And she would talk to me about her husband,\nshe would talk to me about music, she would try to correct my terrible German. She was very\nmuch a teacher, a scholar. I had a great admiration for her, and affection for her. It wasn\u2019t\nunusual for people to end up in our house with very few questions asked. I mean, it\u2019s very\nstrange, but in those circumstances you don\u2019t ask very often. I don\u2019t ever remember saying how\ndid Frau Mometchka come? I never knew. And I didn\u2019t know how she went, because when I\ncame back from one mission, she wasn\u2019t there. And I said, \u201c\u201cWhere\u2019s Frau Mometchka?\u201d And\nthey said, \u201cOh no, she\u2019s not here any more.\u201d And I never knew where she went, but because of\nthe speed, and the ferocity of everything that was going on, and the anxiety of pri -- everyday\nlife, I didn\u2019t ask, and I never knew.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019ve told us that you lived in this -- th-the house that had formerly been occupied by\none of the local Nazis, but your office I believe, was elsewhere. Could you tell us about the\noffice, and w -- and the job that you went there to do, and that you ended up doing?",
        "A: The office was a short distance from the house. It was just a v -- a few minutes walk from the\nhouse up a country lane, and was simply a low, brick building. I don\u2019t know what it had been\nbefore. It looked a bit like a -- a keeper\u2019s house. It -- but we used it as an office. It had obviously\nbeen a house. And I set up there with a typewriter and looked out over onto the fields. And -- and\nthat\u2019s really where the work of the unit was fashioned in that -- in that place. There was a\nGerman man, who\u2019d obviously been close to his master, the Nazi, I think, leader. I took an\ninstant dislike to him, and I would often work in the building on my own. I -- I -- ?ma slow\nworker, and I often -- and I still do it, I work late and long, and I would often be in the building\non my own and he\u2019d be stoking the -- there was like a furnace, an old-fashioned furnace where\nyou burned wood to heat the boiler for hot water and so on. Like a boiler. And he would fidget\nabout the house and I was terribly uneasy with him there. And I found some leaflets in the house,\nNazi leaflets. I asked him to throw them in the fire. There was a whip -- I always remember that,\nthere was a whip hanging up on the wall. Now, that could have been for anything, I mean it need\nnot have had an ominous -- a particularly ominous meaning, maybe they had animals, I don\u2019t\nknow. But it -- 1t made me very uneasy. And I said to him one day, \u201cWhat is that doing there?\nWhy is it here in the house? It\u2019s not something I want to see.\u201d And he said, \u201cHm, it was always\nin the house.\u201d And I -- I said, \u201cPlease take it away, get rid of it.\u201d But he didn\u2019t like me, and I\ndidn\u2019t like him. And Frau Shermburg -- Frau Shermburg looked to me for arbitration and\nnegotiation. She recognized very quickly that I could negotiate for her and her daughter with\nHenry the director, and f-for any facilities that she needed. And that became my role. She would\nshow me photographs of her husband, the doctor who was killed, and her son, standing near the\nArc de Triomphe. And --",
        "Q: In uniform, presumably?",
        "A: In uniform, looking very much the Nazi -- well, the -- the German officer that he was. And it\nwas very difficult, it was very difficult. It was a mother showing a picture of -- of her husband,\nher son. She maintained, as did her daughter, and I believe it to be so, that when the Russians\ncame in to where they were living in eastern Germany, they were both raped many times and in\nfront of each other and that -- that was not surprising, the story of rape was very common, both\nin -- particularly within the Russian zone. And you know, these kind of situations, to do with\nwho you are and where you\u2019re born, become very relevant -- and the choices that you make. And\nyou have to ask yourself what choices did she have? On the other hand she didn\u2019t see the\nsignificance of showing me the picture of her son standing near the Arc de Triomphe. I did have\nto point that out to her. It was a -- it was difficult, this relationship with local Germans, very\ndifficult. And I remember looking out of the window one day when a colleague of mine, Edith\nBlau, who\u2019d been in a concentration camp, and who\u2019d been liberated with her mother by the\nRussians, and both of them were living in our house -- as I say, people came and went, and\npeople stayed, and she stayed. And she\u2019s now in this country, in -- in England. And she was\npassing a group of Germans in -- she was in uniform with a yellow star, she became a member of\nour team. And I s -- I was looking out of the window and I saw her strike, very hard, one of the\nGerman women who\u2019d obviously made a remark about the Jews, having seen the yellow star. So\ntensions were high. Strange things did happen. There were stories about Germans putting wire\nacross the streets in order that British soldiers on motorcycle could be decapitated, and that did\nhappen. And it was an uneasy time. You did not sleep easily, let me put it that way. You -- you\nwere aware, all the time, of tensions, of hatred. Your own and others. And that was hard. That\nwas hard, that bit.",
        "Q: Tell me about the first few days, first few weeks in your job.",
        "A: Well, for the first few weeks of my job, I think, was trying to help Henry to get some sort of\norder into what was a fairly chaotic situation, and to try to formulate some kind of strategy for\nthe administration of a headquarters. I\u2019d never had any experience of that before, but he, being\nan army officer, a captain in the British army, had experienced -- and so I learned from him. And\nwe did quite well, I think; he was efficient. But after just a couple of days we went to Belsen\ntogether. We drove. And a ye -- part of Mrs. Henriekie\u2019s team, she led the first team into Belsen,\nthe first team of the Jewish Relief Unit into Belsen. And her team was there, and I must say I was\nincredibly nervous. It was reassuring being with Henry, but nevertheless, I was very nervous.\nNow, I can\u2019t remember that first day very well. We went to the -- to the concrete blocks which\nhad belonged to the -- oh, to the ger -- German army -- to the -- forgive me, I\u2019Il come back to\nthat. But you know that the people who\u2019d been in -- liberated from camp one, when camp one\nwas burned down, they were taken to the concrete blocks, where the German army had -- had\nbeen billeted.",
        "Q: We just paused there, and -- to allow Mrs. Bamber to reflect on whose barracks we were\ntalking about exactly.",
        "A: It was the former German barracks, but I -- I -- I do not -- th-the name, it has escaped me.\nSome people refer to is as the former SS bar -- barracks. I\u2019m not sure. But whatever, the people\nwere incarcerated there in the barracks. And the barracks were bleak, they were kind of solid\nblocks of concrete. I can\u2019t remember the lighting. I always remember it as very dim. I remember\ncandles. I remember staying all night one -- on one occasion with s-somebody who died in one of\nthe rooms. And it was over time talking to people in the rooms that bu -- was my first encounter\nwith the inmates. Now, it wasn\u2019t on that first day. That first day was a kind of initiation into the\nwhole atmosphere of Bergen-Belsen at that time. I met the unit -- the workers. I went to camp\none, which had been burned down. I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which\nhad formed the mass graves. It was very -- there was always about that place particularly, that\ncamp one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death. I\nbelieve it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that\u2019s what it was like.\nIt was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling\nthem. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell. And I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\nAnd sometimes I\u2019m reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell. And this\nsense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that space that was empty. There were no\nbodies, there was nothing. There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty\nspace. And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was\nby the side of you. You felt very uneasy. I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went\nthere many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning. They may be\npeople who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the\ninmates, although very few of them went there. But I went there sometimes, and I attended the\nceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory. I believe\nthere\u2019s a picture somewhere of my unit marching. It\u2019s somewhere in the Vina library, and I\u2019ve\nnever been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they\nrecognize me, mainly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason. But I\nreturned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter,\nbecause I remember sleeping in a sleeping bag with all my clothes on in the very cold winters\nthat followed. And what was I doing there? And that\u2019s the difficulty, I can\u2019t really remember that\nI had a particular role as I had in other places. I went and I talked, and I can\u2019t remember anybody\nasking me to do that, or seeing any value in it. So maybe I elected to go. When I knew that a\ndriver or somebody was going to Belsen, which was very frequent, people frequently went there\nwith provisions or with papers, or what have you. There was no other way of communicating\nthan by going somewhere. The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make\ntelephone calls. And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a place. So it is not\nsurprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by\ntalking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v --\na value. That doesn\u2019t sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of\ndeath, destruction, loss. Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who\nwant to die, many of them, but can\u2019t, it\u2019s very important to receive that information in a way that\nsays to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your story. If you can\u2019t tell it, I will be able to\ntell it for you. But all I can be is your witness, I can\u2019t take away the past. Now I didn\u2019t learn that\nquickly, I learned it painfully because I always felt I couldn\u2019t do anything, what am I doing here?\nI can\u2019t take away the past, I can\u2019t change anything. So what is the value of my presence, and why\ndo I keep coming? And I think it was because I began to learn that being a witness, simple and\nordinary and limited as that may be, does have a value to the person who may not live very long,\nand who knows it. And so, I think in a way that was one of my tasks, but why I spent so many\nweeks there, sleeping on the floor, and what work I did with Henry there, or with anybody else, I\nhonestly can\u2019t tell you. I later went back there many times, when I was responsible much later\nfor what was referred to as the TB train. I was sent to nic -- by Henry, to negotiate in Switzerland\nwith a Jewish organization, humanitarian organization for the transfer of young people suffering\nfrom tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery would be very much greater if they were\ntaken to Switzerland to recover, which was one of the ways people treated tuberculosis in those\ndays. And I went to Switzerland and I met this extraordinary woman. And I remember saying to\nher -- I wasn\u2019t in uniform, and I don\u2019t know why, maybe it was politic -- no, to be -- I just can\u2019t\nremember. And I remember saying to her, \u201cWhy -- why -- how did you recognize me?\u201d And she\nsaid, \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t difficult to recognize you, I would have recognized you anywhere, as one\nJew to another.\u201d Anyway, I went with the x-rays, and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe\nme, I\u2019m saying something extraordinary. Because to persuade people, young people, who were\ndesperate to leave Belsen and other camps, desperate to get out, to emigrate to America or to\nEngland, desperate to get out. To persuade them to have an x-ray to identify that they were\nsuffering tuberculosis was the last thing that they wanted.",
        "Q: Because it excluded them from --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- going to this country?",
        "A: Yes, they would not be acceptable, and they knew that. And there was all kinds of\nmaneuvering and manipulation of x-rays, and t -- name changing, and I mean it was a nightmare.\nAnd it -- it was a killer, I mean I -- I worked incredibly hard, and I remember losing my voice\nwith the sheer -- you know, the -- the energy needed to persuade people that they wouldn\u2019t be\nable to go anyway, that they would be identified anyway at some point as having the illness. And\nI'd hoped I was right to do that. I wasn\u2019t working alone, I had a -- good advisors, but I had to\npersuade people. And then I had to persuade this -- to go with this delightful woman and\npersuade the Swiss authorities. And I remember a very suave, very beautiful, tall Swiss\ngentleman, who made clear to me, reluctantly, that yes, a certain number of young people would\nbe acceptable to the Swiss, to go to Davose to be treated for their tuberculosis, on the\nunderstanding only that they were -- could recover, and that they could return to Germany at the\nend of their treatment. And that was th -- one of the first political lessons of my lifetime, because\nI learned about the la -- lo -- lack of compassion, I lat -- learned about politics, and in that one\nmeeting, I learned it all. I learned about officialdom, bureaucracy that -- that -- that -- tha-tha --\nthat -- that protects people from the truth, 1t protects people from looking at that sick, young\nperson. And I was very sick at heart myself, I was very upset. But I'd actually got the agreement,\nso I went back to Germany, and then there was an enormous activity on my part, and others\nhelping me, to try to arrange for the evacuation of the young people. And I have pictures of this\nthat can be supplied, to go on what was referred to as the TB train from Hanover station, which\nwas bombed and derelict, catastrophically so, to Switzerland. And eventually -- I mean it was, I\nsuppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn\u2019t feel like a triumph, really. Nothing -- it just felt right,\nI suppose, that young people should be treated eventually after many months, having fought with\nmany officials, British army officials in -- particularly on one occasion, when I needed a\ndocument that hadn\u2019t come. They needed about five or six different permissions in order to leave\nthe camps, from the British military government. And if they hadn\u2019t got all five or six, they\ncouldn\u2019t travel. And in one case I had to go to Dusseldorf, I think 1t was, and persuade them to\nallow a young person in Dusseldorf to travel to Switzerland. And I think we were all day trying\nto persuade them. Finally I think it was only because we offered a lift. We were going to Berlin\nto catch the train, to put the document on the train. I mean, it\u2019s all very primitive stuff. And --\nand I got per -- I think that he was persuaded because we gave a lift to somebody to Berlin. And\nfinally I got the documents. Eventually the train went, but it was made clear to me by UNRRA\nand the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short of one particular document necessary for the TB\ntrain. And that, you know, I would be held responsible for that, that everything was on course,\nthat the TB train would come. It was all arranged by the Red Cross, but that at the last minute,\nthere could be a hitch, and that that was my responsibility because I hadn\u2019t got this document. So\nI remember standing on this train, waiting for it to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation,\neverybody was happy. The children, the young people were laughing and singing and looking\nout of the window, and I was terrified that at the end of the day there would be a hitch. Some\nofficial, some army official would come along and say I\u2019m so sorry, but this is not correct,\nthere\u2019s -- something here is missing. However, it went. And I remember jumping off the train\nand think, my God, it\u2019s gone. And looking at this train -- and you\u2019ve got to picture Hanover\nstation without a roof, with things hanging down, and this train wobbling away, and the kids\nhanging out of the window. And I remember standing there with tears running down my face and\nthinking it\u2019s going to be all right, they\u2019re going to go -- I don\u2019t know what happened to the\nchildren.",
        "Q: Let me take you back -- whoops -- let me take you back to -- to Belsen, and your early days\nthere. How many survivors were there, and where were they from, what kind of state were they\nin? Can you tell me about them? You\u2019ve taken us as far as describing the barracks where they\nwere housed. What do you see in terms of -- of -- of the people within those barracks?",
        "A: The people were mainly Polish, Romanian, from eastern Europe. There was one remote\nGerman woman who remained. And the reason, of course, was that most had been killed much\nearlier on. And she would always talk to me about the if factor. If my husband had only done\nthis, he would not have been taken to the gas chambers. If he hadn\u2019t looked in my direction, or if\nhe had kept quiet. Or if -- if -- if -- and this was always the word that people used all the time. If -\n- if only. And this preoccupied people so much, if only. And so you constantly had to ge -- take\npeople back to the fact that it was -- it was totally out of their hands, that there was an\ninevitability about this. And -- but it was such a painful journey to take with people. She spoke\nEnglish I remember. Mostly Polish, some were ruma -- well, eastern Europe. And of course, the\ntwo famous people who emerged as leaders of the camp eventually, and who I got to know very\nwell, was Yosul Rosenzoft, a former lawyer, Polish, and Dr. Bimko, who became his wife.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. Right, so you were\ntelling me you take Mrs. Forest, to -- to give us the names of the two leaders. But before that, if\nyou can give me a sense of the kind of condition these people were in, how they were dressed,\nhow they lived, how they slept, and the kind of experiences with which they were then trying to\ncome to terms already, I think.",
        "A: I remember people sleeping on the floor, and dressed in old jackets, trousers. Things were\nhanded out, and when we ourselves had supplies of clothes, but they were ill-fitting, and people\nwore anything, so people continued to look somehow ill-kempt, and ill -- ill-fitting, ill-dressed,\nill-cared for. They were emaciated, so very few things really fitted them well. They looked ill,\nthey had a terrible pallor, terrible color. But what you have to, I think, remember, is that people\nsurvive because they are survivors very often. You know, there\u2019s a s -- there\u2019s a reason, there\u2019s a\ncertain something, X factor, that putting chance to one side, where you stand or where you don\u2019t,\npeople do survive. Once they\u2019ve -- they\u2019re into the role of survivor, they do begin to get a\nresilience, and a kind of strength, and so people were fiercely active, fiercely wanting to get out,\nfiercely wanting to organize in some way, and fiercely angry. But people, how did they look\nwhen I first saw them? Ill, emaciated, thin hands. Very thin hands. They had the hands of old\npeople like you -- you see sometimes in hospitals where th-the whole hand di -- hardly resembles\na hand, where the bones stick out, and they used to press their fingers into you very often, in a\nkind of se -- with a sense of urgency they would hold you. And you would hold them, if you\nwere sensible, and -- and you would rock, because rocking was very much part of the way they\nwould present. You would sit on the floor sometimes with people and hold and rock. And people\nwould hold you, and dig their fingers in while they told you their story. And I always -- and I\u2019ve\nsaid in my writings that they spat out their story like a kind of vomit, 1t came out in a hissing\nsound. It\u2019s just barely audible, you -- you often couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying, but\nyou knew, without understanding just by the -- some words, some snatches of things. You were\nnever alone with anyone. There were always people there. There was always people around, so\npeople would often ch-chime in, and -- and come up with something. But I -- I was alone with\nthe German woman, and I can\u2019t remember the circumstances, and I\u2019m just hoping -- I don\u2019t think\nit was at ca -- you see, I spent a lot of time in the camp of Kownitz, but I\u2019m sure it was Belsen\nbecause in -- in Kownitz they were mainly Hungarian, and in Belsen I think, for some reason, I\nwas more alone with her. And she told me about her husband, and it was very pitiful. But people\nsoon -- soon began to resemble some form of normal kind of appearance. Their faces would fill\nout, their stomachs would protrude because I think it\u2019s part of malnutrition. You don\u2019t suddenly\nbecome -- you don\u2019t fill out properly, you fill out chaotically. And particularly with the younger\npeople. But I remember some young adolescent boys, and they looked like any young kids from\na village, with caps and ill-fitting clothes, and they didn\u2019t look so unusual after some months.\nPeople recovered, and they recovered slowly. Those that were going to die, died very quickly, I\nbelieve.",
        "Q: On that subject -- on that subject, the day you arrive, I believe -- you know, th-there was --\nthere was such a sense of desperation still, that a woman took her own life, and her child\u2019s. Do\nyou recall that?",
        "A: Yes, I do. The day I arrived in Belsen, we were told that a woman who\u2019d had a -- a child by, I\nthink a Ukrainian guard, had drunk Lysol, and her -- poured the Lysol down the throat of her\nchild, and they both died. And it -- it was horrific. And it was -- yes, it\u2019s strange I didn\u2019t\nremember that at first, that that was so important. But we all block. And there was a sense of real\nhorror and upset amongst the workers about this woman.",
        "Q: How did it affect the other survivors?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know. I only know how it affected the workers, and it was -- it felt like a sense of\nfailure, like it does with all carers, who care for people who take their lives. You feel you have\nfailed them. So, there\u2019s a kind of so-called reasonably normal response in a totally, totally\nabnormal situation.",
        "Q: In terms of food and medicine and equipment and so on, how well were you equipped to help\nthese people?",
        "A: I think we often lacked supplies. I remember on one occasion we were waiting for some\nsupplies to come, and eventually a -- a truck arrived at the -- our headquarters. And it turned out\nto be a traveling synagogue and didn\u2019t have the supplies that we wanted. And those of us who\nwere less religiously inclined had quite a lot to say at the time, including myself. We were\nfurious, and very upset. Oh, so much for what people feel you need. It was -- I mean, a lot of\nsupplies were coming in. ORT was very good. There were other American organizations\nbringing in supplies. And we ourselves did have supplies and we did man the hospital in Belsen,\nwhich was run, I think, by one of the nun\u2019s sisters, who was a m -- a nurse. Henry Lunzer --",
        "Q: So this is a -- this is a sister of your boss?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, and she was running the hospital there. And I remember her showing us around\nthe hospital, and the hospital was called the Glen Hughes Hospital after Brigadier Glen Hughes\nwho reli -- who liberated Belsen, and who was, I believe, a remarkable man. What can I say\nabout the hospital? I think I learned -- I learned so much in those months I was in Germany. You\nknow, I think what I -- I learned, looking at what was going on in that hospital -- you\u2019ve got to\nremember that nurses of the 30\u2019s and the 40\u2019s were brought up to believe in everything being\nabsolutely pristine, to be -- you know, to have sheets that are tightly drawn, to have -- you know,\nto have everything clean, and -- and cared for. And again, it\u2019s like all the bureaucracies -- I mean,\nI do understand it, it -- it is -- the idea of chaos 1s always frightening, but chaos can sometimes be\nquite healing. And what I thought was very good, was when I watched people helping their own\npeople. By that I mean maybe relatives, maybe friends, maybe a child, somebody feeding their --\ntheir relative, or their friend. And it would be a mess. The cl -- the cl -- the -- the bed would be in\na mess. Their trembling hands would never quite reach the mouth appropriately and there would\nbe mess all over the bedclothes, and -- but -- but there was a to -- it was noise, and there was\nbustle, and there was a sense of activity. And I think that that is far safer for healing than the kind\nof -- the preparation for -- you na -- this sort of -- you being prepared for death with your white\nsheet tucked tightly round you, and I\u2019m simplifying something very much, and I must be\nforgiven for that, because there 1s a place for order in a hospital scene, and many people do ask\nfor it. But there are situations in which chaos and care can match, and can bring about solutions.\nAnd when I started, many years later with a group of other mothers, an association for the\nwelfare of children in hospitals, so that mothers could go into hospital with their small children\nunder the age of five, I remembered all the time the lessons that I\u2019d learned in that hospital. And\nthat is that sometimes it\u2019s better for a bit of chaos if you are looking after your child, and the\nsense of care and love is there. And there will be people who will disagree with me about this,\nand people who will remember everything about Belsen differently than I do, but I was only 20\nyears old, impressionable, taking everything in and not all of it may be as coherent as the listener\nwould wish.",
        "Q: Well, you say you were very young, as indeed you were, but in -- how could you, at such a\nvery young age, absorb and make any sense of what you were seeing?",
        "A: I think I was all -- you know, I don\u2019t remember approp -- this sounds rather self indulgent, but\nI don\u2019t remember a proper childhood. I remember being a very grown-up child. Not willingly,\nbut somehow forced upon me by circumstances. I was always very serious, although I enjoyed\nfun, and I enjoyed fun when I was in Germany with my comrades. We had lots of fun and\nlaughter, like one does in extreme situations. But -- I mean, you -- it -- it\u2019s difficult now to -- to\nbe honest, and to say did I absorb all that then, or have I somehow taken it in and absorbed it\nslowly over the years? And there may be something in the latter, because every time I look back,\nI realize of things I learned, and maybe I didn\u2019t realize at the time I was learning about human\nrelationships, about everything, and about hatred, about love, everything was encapsulated in that\nexperience.",
        "Q: Given the kind of desperate physical and psychological state of -- of these survivors, how did\nyou begin? Can you recall how you began trying to reach out to them, and help them?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember trying. I remember moving into the blocks and talking, and being a ve -- and\nsort of sitting on the ground. I mean, don\u2019t misunderstand, as people became stronger, they\nbecame angry, and you, being the carer, you being the provider, would often become the target\nfor people\u2019s anger, because you could not provide the answers. So I think with the creativity that\nexisted amongst some of the survivors, and our own need to feed into that, we were able to\nsupport some of the things that were going on. For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and\nsomebody called Norbert Fallheim, who later committed suicide, formed a committee within the\ncamp. They were representatives of the camp. We were the next sort of go-between between\nourselves, between them, and UNRRA, and the military government. So we would naturally,\nwhilst we were supporting what they were doing, at the same time we would become the\nrecipients of much of their anger. And I can remember sitting in an old Merck car that had been\ncommandeered from somewhere by somebody, sort of closely packed in at the back with\nNorbert, and Yosul, and somebody else, and myself desperately trying to take notes with Henry\nand somebody else in the front, while they were raging and ranting and very angry indeed. About\n-- but you see, curiously enough, I think it was a relief because it was human, and it was life.\nAnd it was such a relief from the desperate, dejected, huddled figures. You know, sometimes\nwhen I used to go -- when I first started to go into the rooms, people didn\u2019t look like human\nbeings, they -- th-they were all kind of like a huddle of clothes sitting there. It was quite horrible,\nbecause it was dim, and y -- and you couldn\u2019t always identify nu -- it -- and here were people\nshouting about what they wanted, and being very angry, with us, with them, with everybody.\nAnd in a way, although I felt very vulnerable sometimes, at being shouted at, I also was a go-\nbetween in my familiar familial pattern, between them and my own hierarchy, between them and\nHenry. And so they would come to me, either in Eilshausen, and they would ask me to negotiate,\nand they would complain about Henry, and then they would complain to Henry about UNRRA,\nand then all the rest of it and so on. Because of course, what they wanted more than anything else\nwas freedom, and they hadn\u2019t got it. I mean, I\u2019m making it sound as if I understood it all, and I\ndon\u2019t think I did. I think it\u2019s only with hindsight that I can talk about anger as being something\nvery positive. But it\u2019s something that makes you feel alive, whereas when I used to see the\npeople huddled, and I thought to myself, I wonder if they\u2019re going to die, th -- I'd -- I -- I think I\njust felt that I could do more in that situation of vigor and anger, and -- and vision, because they\nhad a vision of what they wanted.",
        "Q: Which was?",
        "A: Well, they wanted out. They wanted out of the camp. Some people wanted -- you know, this\nis a difficulty now, this is a big difficulty, because people talk about the formation of an\norganization that was -- whose aim was Palestine. Now, my recollection is that there were many\npeople who wanted to go, for one reason or another, either to America or to England. And\nobviously they couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: When you say obviously, can you explain that for us?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very little different than it is now, really. I don\u2019t think you could get into England\nunless you were sponsored by a relative or friend, and sponsored quite energetically. You had to\nbe able to provide for that person completely and absolutely. And one or two people did go from\nKownitz. So I don\u2019t remember anybody going from -- from Belsen. And others wanted to go to\nAmerica, and I\u2019m sure some did. And some people did come to -- to England. But there were\nmany -- the majority didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t. And I think it was only with the realization that nobody\nreally wanted them again -- yet again. That no -- that the doors were not opening generously to --\nand -- and -- and with -- what\u2019s the word I want? Like, with countries joining together in order to\nprovide a solution for this group of people, who remained there, some of them, until 1950.\nWhich is a very long time from 1945. So it\u2019s not surprising that people became more militant and\nmore determined that Palestine was the only solution for the Jewish people.",
        "Q: Again, let me take you back a little bit, because I think a lot of us don\u2019t know quite as much\nand -- and we need filling in. I\u2019m very interested to know what a typical day was, or a typical\nweek in your life out there, or in the life of the team. What you did in the office, what you did\nwith the people, you know, in a fairly basic kind of way.",
        "A: I mean, I was very involved with Henry in trying to negotiate for better facilities within the\ncamps. And withi -- and within groups where Jewish people had -- had -- had come and were in\nneed of provision, and -- and -- and support. And so we would be writing and Henry would be\nmeeting -- I might accompany him with others, to try to negotiate, either with UNRRA or with\nthe British government for better facilities here, and better facilities there. I would write endless\nletters, and I would be -- spend a huge amount of time screaming down the telephone because the\ntelephones did exist, but it was almost impossible to hear anyone, and you would spend hours\ntrying to get somebody, and it made such a difference because otherwise you just had to get ina\ntruck and go. So I would do normal secretarial work in support for Henry. I would accompany\nhim, particularly where Yosul and Norbert was concerned -- were concerned. But I spent a lot of\ntime -- and this again is something I'd -- I can\u2019t put -- I can\u2019t be too correct about, because I\nsimply can\u2019t remember. I went to Kownitz camp -- what happened at Kownitz was that -- and I\ncan\u2019t even tell you exactly where it 1s --",
        "Q: This was a camp for women, was it?",
        "A: There were mainly women, there were some men, but there were li -- a large number of\nHungarians -- Hungarian woman, but there were some young men. And we got a telegram to the\nunit, which -- which I -- it came to me, saying that -- that they were desperate, that they had no\nprovisions, no means of support, that -- that there was this camp, and there was nothing and they\nwere desperate.",
        "Q: How many people were there, do you recollect?",
        "A: A lot. I don\u2019t remember the number, and I can\u2019t tell you the number. It was quite -- it must\nhave been about 600 - 700 people, I think. And I went there, but I don\u2019t remember with whom. I\nwent there with somebody and we had a meeting in a room, up some stairs, wooden stairs with --\nthere were only candles, it was very cold then, very cold.",
        "Q: Which winter was this?",
        "A: The first. I just wish one could remember more, who was with me. And I went back with\nwhoever, and negotiated for provisions, for supplies, for acknowledgement that this camp existed\nand needed, you know, the support of UNRRA and other facilities, as well as our own. But then\nthey got -- was a -- was a situation in which I would go very frequently to the camp, and that\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be acknowledged by anybody now who can remember. Neither Henry, nor\nAllison Ward, with -- who was our personnel officer, and who 1s still alive. Both are still alive.\nNeither have a clear recollection of Kownitz. Allison said yes, she remembers that I used to go\noff frequently with this former Hungarian Jewish Brigade leader, and that we would work there.\nBut I can\u2019t tell you how it was, whether I elected to g -- I know I must have elected to go because\nI was there so often. I was there for their first Pesach, which we had in the open. And I remember\nwe atrived late, and they were quite fed up with us for being late, and they had to carry me across\nall the tables, and there was enormous hilarity about that, as I was carried aloft across tables. And\nI got to know them very well. But they needed a lot of support, they were young women, who\nwere very beautiful many of them, who were very si -- very vulnerable. Who the person I was\nworking with was very anxious to protect from the sexual advances of any soldiers. And I\nremember a very moving discussion in which he spoke, and said -- and I was so touched that in\nthe middle of Germany, in the middle of all this mess, a camp that was mud, you were up to your\nankles in mud at the time -- or later, because 1t was snowing then, but he -- he spoke to the\nwomen and told them, you must preserve yourself. You\u2019ve been preserved for a reason. I can\nremember it to this day. You\u2019ve been preserved for a reason. Don\u2019t destroy yourselves, don\u2019t\ncapitulate to men who find you beautiful and who want to give you chocolate, and who want to\ntry to help you, and maybe not help you. He was really telling them, you have a sexuality which\nyou\u2019re only just realizing because in the camp your hair was cut, you didn\u2019t have your periods,\nyou now do -- but he didn\u2019t say this in so many words. But he gave this very moving talk to\nthem. I was so touched by this, and thought it was so wonderful that -- that we should be talking\nthere, preserve yourselves somehow as a woman, and as women. And it\u2019s important. And then\nwe danced, I remember we did lots of dancing.",
        "Q: What kind of dancing was that?",
        "A: Oh, anything, we just danced. We danced the hora a lot, and -- hora, and then we -- there were\npeople who knew various variations that I\u2019d never seen before, that were fascinating. And lots of\nsongs and wonderful, it was wonderful the way -- it was full of life. I met two of the woman\nlater, here. And they\u2019d managed somehow. But 1-it\u2019s -- I-I don\u2019t know what we were trying to do\nthere, we were trying and -- 1-1-it was such a unsupported group of people, and it was so\nprimitive. I think 1t was a very primitive camp. Somebody once described it as a very good one. I\nthought it was very primitive. I remember there was a sort of wooden toilet, you know, one of\nthese open jobs, and sort of just by the side of the camp, and you know, you had to have people\non guard when you went in there, because there\u2019s no way you could fasten the door, and it was --\nit -- that place was cold and primitive. We got supplies in, we got learning material in. We did\nsomething. We did our best.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Helen Bamber. Now, the survivors\nwho you dealt with were now officially displaced persons. What did that mean?",
        "A: Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or\nvictim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which 1s a sort of\nanonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum\nseekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used. So the\ncompassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the camp was\nliberated, had gone, in my view. And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number\none. So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a\nnuisance, a -- a problem. They were vocal, they\u2019d become articulate, they had their committee,\nthey were demanding, they wanted rights. What wa -- what rights did they want? They wanted\nrights within the camp, as far as I remember. They wanted rights of travel. They wanted to be\nable to move about Germany. And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this -\n- this can be corrected by others, the people in the camps were not allowed to leave or to travel\nwithout special permit. Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went\nparticularly, as I remember, to Poland, mainly to try to find their relatives. They went to their\nold, former homes to find their relatives. When they got there, they were set upon by the local\npeople, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place. And the\npeople, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into\nGermany, and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the camp. I use barbed wire as a -- as\na -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration. So their options were very limited. If they\nwanted to find their relatives -- and this was at the beginning, for the first year or so was the most\nimportant as I remember it, was the finding of relatives. Now we had set up a search bureau in\nBelsen. And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing\nwas to set up a search bureau. People who would come to the camp, again presumably illegally\nbecause they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or\nto leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper. It was probably cigarette paper,\nwith the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so? And the names\nwould be on these little bits of paper. And they would give them to you, or they would give them\nto anybody. They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best.",
        "Q: How did the search bureau work?",
        "A: I\u2019m not well acquainted with the search bureau. The search bureau presumably tried to marry\npeople through the camp, or through other means, relatives of the named person, so -- on the\npiece of paper. So, it did it\u2019s job. Whether it did it adequately, I can\u2019t say. It was primitive. But in\nsome cases people were reunited. There were other search bureaus that were established as time\nwent on. I\u2019m not quite sure if the Red Cross was not involved also in trying to reunite people.\nThat also can be confirmed. I have -- you -- you know, I have a very fragmented,\ncompartmentalized memory of this particular period of my life. So I can\u2019t really speak with\nauthority about the organization of the search bureaus. I know that there were several, I know\nthat we had one in the camp. And I know that people came searching for their relatives, handing\nbits of paper to each other in order to see whether somebody remembered somebody. It was\npathetic, and very sad. Full of pathos, very sad to watch.",
        "Q: You\u2019d been -- you\u2019d been speaking earlier about the options available to people now -- once\nthey were DPs, if you like. Can you tell us a little more about the options they were seeking?\nYou said that some of them wanted to go home, for example, to Poland, and what became of\nthem.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: But what about those who -- who had their eyes set on other countries?",
        "A: I think my memory 1s of people wanting to come, many of them, to England or to America.\nThere was no means by which they really could simply ask to come. I\u2019m not sure if the\nAmerican quota system was operating in the way that it normally does. In other words, so many\nfrom -- you know, that you\u2019re on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish.\nBut what I do know was that it wasn\u2019t possible simply to enter the US, or the UK, not really.\nSome people did, and they\u2019re very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have\ndone it, but they must forgive me, I don\u2019t believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise\nthey would have done it. I-It\u2019s -- 1t was hard for people, they couldn\u2019t get out, and they couldn\u2019t\ngo anywhere. They couldn\u2019t go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn\u2019t go to the Iron\nCurtain countries. They knew that they would be badly treated if they did. They knew what was\ngoing on by returnees. And so what were their options? To find their relatives, to -- but then, as\nthe months passed people realized that nothing had happened. Perhaps they had found a relative,\nperhaps they\u2019d accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive. Or they lived in hopes, but they\nstill wanted to get out. Outside the camps, of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to\nfraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various zones. And this came very\nhard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was\ngoing on outside. I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many\nthat they were not wanted. That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their doors. I\nmean, many people returned to Holland, some maybe to France. But on the whole, people\nremained, and they didn\u2019t want to. So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha\n-- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that 1 -- I believe that it was then that the\nidea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to Palestine is the only solution for their problem.\nAnd I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission. So\npeople began to learn Hebrew if they didn\u2019t already know it. They became more militant. There\nwere the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to Palestine one way\nor another. And of course, many people perished on the way.",
        "Q: What did you know at the time about these illegal journeys?",
        "A: What did I know? Well, everybody knew that it was happening. It was no secret. An\norganization grew, an organization of -- I\u2019m not giving it a name, I don\u2019t know it -- whether there\never was a name, but you know, with all these situations of -- of despair and need, a militancy\ngrows, an urgency grows. People are not going to stay in that situation forever. And historically\nthis has always happened. It\u2019s happening now with the Kurds, and it\u2019s happened elsewhere.\nPeople want something for themselves, and they want freedom and safety. And people will, if\nthey\u2019re not allowed to negotiate for it, they will try to take it. And so people began to go\nillegally, and cross frontiers illegally. And transports from the camps were organized.",
        "Q: From yours as well, among the people you knew? That\u2019s to say, inmates held at Belsen also.",
        "A: And Kownitz, yes. Mm.",
        "Q: So how would you find out about this? Would you turn up one day and there\u2019d be fewer\npeople? Or did it work other ways?",
        "A: I know -- I know relatively little about the transports. They were small. People didn\u2019t go in\nlarge numbers, to my knowledge. I remember one particular incident, let me concentrate on that.\nWe were told at the -- our headquarters that -- or we found out somehow, that there were a group\nof I suppose about 15 to 20 people being held in a British army post. And I can\u2019t tell you where it\nwas, but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the Dutch frontier illegally and they\nwere now being held, and had been held for many months in this camp. And in this camp, when\nwe eventually got there, we found that the camp was also a holding place for infamous war\ncriminals and Germans who had -- who -- with a -- with a poor reputation. So I went with the\nleader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one lorry, and I think, too, we had another lorry with --\nor truck, large truck, which would house another group, and a small, kind of mobile ambulance\nwhich was intended for the pregnant woman who was quite near term. So I think we probably\nhad a nurse with us. I can\u2019t remember that, but I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be\nnecessary or prudent to just have the ambulance. So I think we must have had a nurse with us. So\nthere were several of us, and when we got to the camp, the lorries stood in the comp -- in the\nmain kind of open area, bef -- we -- we came into an open space. On the left of us was this open\ncamp site with barbed wire, in which the Germans were standing or pacing. And there was one\nwoman, whose name I think has been given as Irma Grace, but I\u2019m not sure if it was she, and I\nwill check that for the record, but it was definitely a woman of -- who was well-known for her\ncrimes. And -- and when the lorries stopped, and we were to get out and go and negotiate with\nthe British post, the inmates, the German inmates started to chant. They realized that we had\ncome for, in inverted commas, the Jews. And they began to chant, and it wasn\u2019t a very friendly\nchant. Something similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out with the Jews, but nasty stuff. I can\u2019t remember\nthe exact words, but it was very ominous, and the whole scene was very ominous. And as we\nbegan to -- as we negotiated, and we received the people, and they were walking towards the\ntruck, and we were loading them onto the trucks, the chanting got louder, and louder, and louder.\nAnd my colleague said, \u201cStart them singing, get them singing.\u201d And so they started to sing.",
        "Q: The -- the Jews who you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- had come to collect.",
        "A: Mm. And so, rather reminiscent of that film with Ingrid Bergman and -- you know, that\nfamous \u201cCasablanca\u201d thing, but not dissimilar may I tell you, because the singing got louder and\nlouder, and the chanting got louder, and it was extremely unpleasant. And I\u2019ve never -- that\nscene, I -- I will never forget, because of it\u2019s ominous nature, it\u2019s pure, unadulterated hatred that\nwas present, and the kind of slightly banal, rather semi-amused laid back attitude of the British\nsoldiers from whom we were collecting the former inmates. And they were from Kownitz, I\nthink. And we took them in the trucks, and the proud, pregnant lady haughtily rejected the\nambulance, and was most affronted. So the ambulance, it trailed behind, and we had our two\ntrucks and we took them back. And it -- th-there was some exuberance I remember, some --\nsome sense of release, relief. And there was a lot of singing, but people were tired, and\nexhausted, and it was a long drive, I remember. And I remember that there was a boy, young\nboy, and we held out our arms to help the people out of the -- out of the lorry, and he refused\nthat, and he jumped down. And I -- I talked to him for a little while. And when we got back into\nthe truck -- because people needed to relieve themselves, I think we had food as well, we got\nback into the truck, this young boy, as we dropped him off in -- in the compound in Kownitz said\nto me, \u201cYou will remember me. Remember me.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019Il remember you.\u201d And I\nstayed in Kownitz, I -- I don\u2019t know where or how, I can\u2019t remember where I slept. And I asked,\nI think, several days later where the group was, and I was told that they\u2019d gone off again, and\nthat this time they had crossed the frontier and they had got away. So not, I think, the pregnant\nlady. I don\u2019t remember. Well, it may have been, but whatever, they had gone. So yes, there were\ntransports, and they behaved as all people do in these situations, with incredible determination\nand much courage. Many died. Some were shot crossing the frontiers as well. But more than that,\nI don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t say.",
        "Q: Just pause it there for a second. I wanted to talk a little bit now about how the camp at Belsen\nfunctioned, how it was organized and -- and what people did all day whe -- when you first\narrived.",
        "A: You know, I\u2019m not quite -- to be honest, I\u2019m not quite clear about what people did all day as\nfar as the inmates were concerned. I think -- it wasn\u2019t a camp that I worked in day in and day out.\nMy impression 1s that they did very little at the beginning because they were so vulnerable, so\ndebilitated, it would be difficult to imagine an actual activity. I believe that the more orthodox\ngathered and prayed, and went about their devotions. And I\u2019m sure there was some activity, but\nthere was very little structure to the camp as I remember it. It was the emergence of Yosul\nRosenzoft and Norbert Fallheim, and the establishment of a committee many months later. And\nalso with the presence of ORT providing workshops. And I do have, and I w-will have to donate\nit at some time, a small pot, a small vase from some metal that was found somewhere, which\nsomeone gave me, which is one of the f -- one the early products of the er -- ORT workshop. So\npeople began to occupy themselves. They began to form into their political and religious\ngroupings. The theater was established and became one of the liveliest and the most exciting\nexponents of resilience and life in the camp.",
        "Q: Tell me about it.",
        "A: Well, the theater would start with, nearly always as far as I remember, with a very raw just\nsort of exposure on the stage of the destruction of a family. The scene would start with the\nmother, father and children sitting round a table, very familiar table. And you can see that they\nwere joyful, that they were engaged with each other, arguing, discussing, etcetera. And then you\nheard the marching toward the door that would open on the family in which the Germans would\ncome. And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the\nmother being dragged away. The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was\nplayed time and time and time again. And it would be received in absolute silence. It was the\nhomage to the family, to the destroyed family. Whether it was a form of mourning, I\u2019m not sure.\nIt could -- it could have been. It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the\nworld know this is what happened to my family. I think it was more that than mourning, because\nit\u2019s my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque\nhappenings as those that they witnessed and were part of. So I think it\u2019s probably to do with -- to\ndo with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it. And as the\nmilitary government and -- and officials from UNRRA were often invited to th -- these concerts.\nNot always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it\u2019s not surprising that they would\nwant to say this. This 1s, or was my family, and this is how it was for me. It was incredibly\nintimate, and terrible to watch. And there was never any applause, there was only silence. But\nthen there would be other things taking part. I don\u2019t remember all of it, but I remember that very\noften there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or\nPolish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the\nBritish rule, the British command and the British zone, the attitude to the camp. There would be -\n- and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of\ncourse, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army,\nwho\u2019d hadn\u2019t understood a word of this cabaret. And I think the cabaret was done very much in\nthe old-fashioned kind of really sort of German style cabaret. You know, it was ironic, it was -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s meaning was very, very clear, and I believe it was very, very clever. I didn\u2019t always\nunderstand it all. And so the theater was very important, the hospital was important, the\nworkshops, the committees. The constant badgering for different individuals to move or do\nsomething, to go somewhere within Germany for whatever reason. Other than that, I cannot\nreally -- I cannot really remember other activities.",
        "Q: How about the -- the newspaper, wasn\u2019t there a newspaper?",
        "A: Oh yes, there was a newspaper, of course there was a newspaper. Yes, there was a newspaper\nproduced with again, factual and ironic comments about the life of the DP, and the life of Belsen.\nAnd -- and so on. No, th -- th -- there\u2019s a newspaper, I wish -- I wonder if there\u2019s ever any of this\nleft. \u2019' ve never seen anything. So much was of the moment, and you don\u2019t think in terms of\nhistory, which one should. Anyway, that\u2019s how it was, as far as I remember.",
        "Q: So it went from being a rather desolate, to maybe quite a spirited place.",
        "A: Yes, it was. It had its spirit, it had its resilience, it had its sense of life. And I think that there\nwas a group of younger people there who were going to survive at all costs. Somehow survival\nand strength meant a great deal to them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea\nof Palestine as their solution. Whether the Palestine or the Israel that we see now would have\nbeen different, I believe it might, but others don\u2019t agree with me. Had Britain and America taken\npeople more readily and quickly, and quickly solved this question of people remaining within the\ncamp that once abused them -- I mean, there\u2019s nothing much worse than that, really. Pretty awful\nstuff. I don\u2019t know. It may be a very simplistic way of looking at a very complex problem. But\nthe sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent. And I\nhave seen it elsewhere.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Helen Bamber. To what extent do you\nthink the work that you did, and the work that your colleagues did contributed to this resurgence\nof the human spirit, if you\u2019d like, in the camp? The one that you\u2019 ve just described.",
        "A: I find it difficult to make claims, I always do. I think that we were part of it. We were part of\nthe res -- I don\u2019t want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac --\nsomething of the restoration of the human spirit. We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the\npeople, something of the spirit. Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed\nand performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways. I\u2019m not taking\nresponsibility for it. I believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support\nand resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular\nindividuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean. I\nmean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had\nquite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was\nhelpful. The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that\n-- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on\noccasion by myself, but I don\u2019t want to make too many claims about what we achieved.",
        "Q: All right, well to get away from the claims, let me ask you about this. Beginning, let\u2019s say\nwith a good --",
        "A: I think the hospital was important. I think -- I -- I had less to do with the hospital, but I think\nthe hospital was valuable, and did a great deal for the individuals.",
        "Q: Tell me in what way. I mean, you\u2019ve spoken about one aspect of the hospital, the fact that it\nwas open to friends and relatives and so on.",
        "A: Mm, mm.",
        "Q: But it -- when you say it was particularly important, in what way do you mean that?",
        "A: Well, it was -- 1-it was a place for recovery. And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it\nwasn\u2019t a German hospital. It wasn\u2019t a British hospital ostensibly, it was somehow manned by\nJewish people helping Jewish people. And I think that was very important because you are very\nvulnerable when you are helpless. And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless\nvictims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything. And I think\nwhatever else we did or didn\u2019t do, we did operate it well. I believe that. So I think that was a\nplus. And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something. But if you\nask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don\u2019t think we\nwere responsible. I think it came from the resilience of survivors. Had we not been there it might\nhave been more difficult, let me put it that way. That might be the fairest way to put it.",
        "Q: Can you describe in -- in greater detail how your relationship with people developed, how\nwhen you arrived on this very desolate scene, how you made contact with people, how they\nreacted to you, and how, if at all, you -- you managed to establish some kind of dialog with them,\nand -- and draw them out. Tell me how that process happened there in Belsen, as opposed to\nsince.",
        "A: I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic,\nbut what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody\u2019s hand. I -- I\nfound that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work. When\nthere\u2019s nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody\u2019s hand\nand stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication. So\nyou don\u2019t begin with words, you begin with touch, and that\u2019s all. And sometimes I would just\nwalk away. And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day. But it\nwould be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so\nexhausted, that to take somebody\u2019s hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person,\ntrying to give strength, as it were, to the other person. So that was all I could do sometimes.\nWords came later.",
        "Q: And what happens when -- what happened when the words came, and what happened when\nyou didn\u2019t have a language in common with the people you were nonetheless communicating\nwith?",
        "A: Sometimes people would simply come out with a whole story in explosions. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve said\nbefore like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something. So that 1t would come out stacat -- come\nout in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way. And I would sometimes say either in\nGerman -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in\nYiddish words that I\u2019d learned, as much as I could, if I couldn\u2019t understand somebody, because\nthere would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to\nunderstand the story. So that again is a form of communication. The fact that you don\u2019t\nunderstand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you.\nWithout them, I can\u2019t understand that person. So that\u2019s always a very useful way of looking at\nthings, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you. And I would\nask for help from them.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve said, I believe, that sometimes you were -- they were angry with you, they didn\u2019t want\nyour sympathy, they wanted simply somebody to work out their anger on.",
        "A: Yes, well then, I mean, this 1s something you get in all -- with most survivors and something\nthat you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my present day work. People are angry because they\nare helpless and frightened and -- and they can\u2019t see a way out. And you just have to let them\nshout and be angry. There\u2019s nothing else you can do. You don\u2019t walk away from it.",
        "Q: Did you have at the time any sense that you were achieving something? I mean, when you\nwent back to the requisitioned house at the end of the day, after a visit to Belsen, what did you\ndo? Did you get blind drunk, did you hide under the sheets? What -- what did you do? How on\nearth did you live with this stuff day after day, and what sense did you have, had it been\nworthwhile, the day you just spent?",
        "A: I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization. It\nwas born of it\u2019s time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things\nthat they couldn\u2019t achieve. So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more\ndifficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the\ninstitutions rather than for the people they\u2019re there to help. So we would look at, if we met in the\nevening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a car being stolen,\nor an accident. But we wouldn\u2019t talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt. So there wasn\u2019t much\nof that. What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that\nhouse, that requisitioned house. We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to\neach other. We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and\nRichard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of\nperforming on the stage which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say? Little bit\narrogant and pompous. And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor. And so he would\nsing and perform and we would all act out something. Or we would dance. Now we would\ndance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this. We\u2019d put on something or\nother. We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can\u2019t even\nremember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen\nto music. So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think,\nin the evenings, but we didn\u2019t talk about our feelings. So my main relief would be laughing at\nsomebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter. And we\u2019d have all those\nsort of activities, which was fun.",
        "Q: Privately, did you despair of what you were seeing day after day?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t despair at the time. When I came back to Britain, when I came back to London, I\nwent through a very difficult phase, one that I haven\u2019t experienced since. I -- I can\u2019t explain what\nit was, it was an inability to work with what I\u2019d seen. I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of\nthat kind of happening, I was terrified of it. And I was sure that it was going to happen again.\nAnd I don\u2019t know why I felt that, but I felt afraid. And I used to go to the cinema and sit and\nwatch film after film after film. And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel\noverwhelmed with fear. So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when\nI had come home. And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in\nunderstanding or listening to what I had to say. That was very difficult for me. I\u2019d learned a lot\nof negotiating skills in Germany, and in my family, but I hadn\u2019t learned how to deal, and I still\nfind it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don\u2019t know, who don\u2019t\nwant to hear, and who didn\u2019t want to hear. And I couldn\u2019t bear it. I came back to a country that\nwas preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and\nany effort I made on my part to communicate what I\u2019d seen, even when I was asked to give\nofficial talks about it -- I remember going to the east end and talking in a theater there to people.\nI was actually asking for money, and that may have had something to do with it, but money for\nthe relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit. I still do that sort of thing. And I had to ask for money and\nsay what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don\u2019t\nyou think we\u2019ve suffered enough, we\u2019ve heard enough? But I think it\u2019s partly guilt. I know now\nthat it\u2019s guilt. And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with\npeople that they couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to do anything or know anything at the time. And they\ncertainly didn\u2019t then. And I found that the hardest thing of all. So I despaired when I came back.\nI despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I\u2019ve ever been in my life, I\nthink. Well, almost.",
        "Q: What was it that made you decide to come back and made you decide to come back at a\nparticular time? Maybe you could remind us of the date as well. What -- what was that one single\nthing or that -- were you just completely overloaded with what you\u2019d seen and done?",
        "A: No, I\u2019d been ill, I'd been in hospital. \u2019'd been involved in an accident which I\u2019d had what they\nthought was concussion, I was quite unwell. And I came back on leave and it was decided for\nme, I didn\u2019t decide. I had wanted to go back. In fact, I was dying to go back, I couldn\u2019t wait to go\nback. And I think that partly my despair 1-in this -- in coming back, was due to the fact that I\ncouldn\u2019t go back there, and that I felt more at home there than I did here. And I felt more at ease\nthere, and with myself. And that was very hard for me.",
        "Q: Why did you feel more at ease?",
        "A: I felt more at ease because I knew where I was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and\nwhat I was doing it for. And even if we were failing, or not doing a fantastic job, at least we were\ntrying to do something. Whereas I came back to nothingness, to people who didn\u2019t want to know\nabout it. And that was -- that was awful. So I really found myself in the wilderness when I came\nback. And the fact that it -- that things had changed, new people, new order had been set up out\nthere, Henry was no longer there. It meant that it was difficult for me to go back. And in a way\nthat was quite difficult for me, that whole scene.",
        "Q: Well, I mean it was two things as well, wasn\u2019t it? It was unfinished business, and you hadn\u2019t\nreally said your goodbyes if you were expecting to go back.",
        "A: [hadn\u2019t said my goodbyes to anybody, I hadn\u2019t -- I\u2019d finished the TB train. I mean, that was a\njob, that was a project that lasted many months, and that was the one thing I did achieve,\nwhatever else I did or didn\u2019t achieve, I achieved that. So I felt quite good about the bi -- the -- the\n-- the -- the fact that I\u2019d got a -- managed to get a group of young children and adolescents to\nSwitzerland for treatment of their TB. That was quite an achievement, you know, bearing in\nmind the difficulties that we were faced with. So I felt good about that, but I didn\u2019t feel good\nabout leaving unfinished business, not saying goodbye. I felt very, very bad. It was bad, very\ndifficult for me.",
        "Q: So when you came home and you found this kind of uncomprehending response, what\nhappened? What -- what happened to you?",
        "A: Well, there was a period which I really can barely remember, in which I wandered about, as I\nsay, going to the cinema. Sort of not knowing quite what to do. I eventually went to work for the\nJewish Refugee Committee in their emigration department. And then finally, from there, I was\nasked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, working\nwith a group of young children and adolescents who\u2019d been brought to this country whilst I was\nstill in Germany. They came here in 1945. They were young people, orphans who\u2019d been in\nAuschwitz, and been in the slave labor camps. And because of my background I was asked if I\nwould be a caseworker with that organization.",
        "Q: Well, w-why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about that organization and the -- and the work that\nyou did? We\u2019re taking a little pause. Yes. Before we move on to look in some depth at the work\nyou did when you came back to England, give me an assessment of what you, your organization,\nand people like you achieved in Germany after the war.",
        "A: I think that had it not been for Henry Lunzer, with his or -- with his sort of military\norganization, in setting up an administration, and an office that actually could operate within\nGerman, and particularly in the British zone, but not only in the British zone, in terms of\nprovision, in terms of negotiation with British military government for the needs of different\nindividuals and groups, I think that we would have achieved very little. I think we -- and I think\nthat his support of the need for children to go to the sanatoria in -- in Switzerland was -- was\ngood, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that. I think\nthat he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small\nresources, and you have a base in another country of purse holders and trustees, who have the\nreputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to\nhave a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there. So there were\ninevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well\nknown, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the\nworld. It\u2019s very difficult to keep those communications clean and good. And it certainly was a\nhandicap in -- in the -- in the Jewish Relief Unit at that time.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move on now then, fairly swiftly to the work that you be -- began to do.",
        "A: But I -- I did want to -- but I do -- I do really, at this point, want to pay tribute to Henry\nLunzer because I think that he was a courageous negotiator and was very knowledgeable. He\nknew Germany well, he spoke German well. He could speak to military government. I think, you\nknow, somebody needs to say he did a bloody good job, because he did. Thank you.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s talk then about the work that you did once you came back to London after the\nwar.",
        "A: Once I\u2019d recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the\nworld, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from\nConcentration Camps. I think I mentioned this a little earlier. It was an organization sponsored\nand financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees. And it\u2019s director was a\npracticing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I\u2019d admired very much. Who had been the\ndirector of a type of [indecipherable] institution in Germany, until he himself, as a Jew, was\nexpelled and taken to a concentration camp before the war started, and finally released, and who\ncame to this country, or at least came to Britain as a refugee. And he was, as I say, a practicing\npsychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life,\nand of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in\nthe best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people. I came\nback in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and\nadolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being 1n special homes, out\nof London, where they were helped with language and many different things. By the time I got to\nwork with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some\nkind of future. Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young\npeople, competitive. Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I\nremembered from the camps. Their survival, as -- as had the people in the camps, but let\u2019s just\nmake this kind of -- let\u2019s mark this difference. The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young\npeople I was working with had survived the daily selections for work, or for the gas chamber,\nthrough their ability to maintain strength, to maintain totally focused on their survival, nobody\nelse\u2019s but their survival. Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but\nbasically focused on their own bodily survival. They had to prove their strength, their capacity to\nwork another day. Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival. So\nin dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one\u2019s mind\nthat that was how they survived. And there was never going to be an easy, immediate\ncommunication and trust. There couldn\u2019t be. Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some\ntime. So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of\ncommunication that took into account their need for their own private space. And this 1s quite\nimportant because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke\nabout taking someone\u2019s hand in the camps. What I found with the young people to be very\nimportant was to pi -- allow a space between you and them. A kind of actual, physical space so\nthat -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important\nto maintain that space, but it was. And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of\npower base, their own sense of identity and strength. And I did not invade it.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber. You were talking about\nthe space and your approach -- you were talking about your approach to these young people, and\nhow actually they needed precisely the opposite kind of approach to the people you dealt with in\nBelsen.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And a -- a -- this space was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition. It\nwasn\u2019t something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he\nwas a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had. But I just -- it was something that I just\nsensed as very, very important. Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be\nplaced in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some\nsense of solid -- solidity. However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to,\nso to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced. And I do feel that there was, in\nsome way, a denial of need here. I believe that these young people -- and I\u2019ve said earlier I\nbelieve, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time\nto mourn their dead. And it\u2019s not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the\nsense of their grotesque manner of dying. And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and\nneeds skill. I don\u2019t think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an\nunderstanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture\nof the day, that the idea that -- you see, Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by\nwar, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let\u2019s move forward.\nA new world is born, the war is over, let\u2019s get on with life. That was the message of the day.\nSoldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares. They were\nnot encouraged to talk about the horrors of war. All the war films that came out were really like\nsomething out of Peter Pan, they were so -- so banal, and so sentimental. So sentimental a -- you\nknow, sa -- the war was sentimentalized. It wasn\u2019t portrayed at that stage with all it\u2019s horror. And\nto bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate. Now, I\u2019m not\nsaying that there wasn\u2019t some attention to their inner world. I believe there was some. The Anna\nFreud clinic was involved in some way in observing the young people. But I don\u2019t believe that\nwe dealt with the need to mourn. And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are\nnow, men in their 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation,\nI don\u2019t believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done. It\u2019s easy to say that in\nhindsight. I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social\nterms, flourished, made good, married, had children. But if you observe them, and their\nrelationships, and their long -- I don\u2019t want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very\nsupportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks. So, I mean,\nI went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs. I negotiated yet again\nwith schools, and colleges, and institutions and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes,\nlandlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers. It was a hard time. It had been a hard\nwar, and people were tough, and employers were tough. And the fact that these young people\nwere -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust\nsurvivors, it did not call for compassion. Some were good, some were very good. And many\npeople worked well with the young people, and offered much. And there was a club, and there\nwere facilities and money was sought for special needs. But I would have liked to have dealt\nbetter with some of the strange things that happened. I had a young man, for example, who\u2019d\nbeen -- who had TB. And I went every week to see him here, in a sanatorium near Brentwood.\nHe was a delightful young man from Poland. We spoke together, we talked about his needs. We\ntalked about all kinds of things. But one day when I went there, after many, many months of\ntreatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn\u2019t there. And I was quite upset and I asked the\nnurses what had happened. And they said he just got up and went. Now he -- we don\u2019t know\nwhat happened, and I still to this day don\u2019t know exactly what the process was, whether it was\nlong planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very\nenquiring of me as to why I hadn\u2019t noticed a problem. But such was the defense of this young\nman that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk\nabout quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible\ngirlfriend, all these things we could talk about. But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get\nup and go. So it\u2019s that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis,\nthrough extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide. Where people\nhave built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute\nintimacy and trust. And this is what I think happened with this young man. We ca -- w-we\nmanaged to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a\nfailure.",
        "Q: One boy out of many, then.",
        "A: Well, I mean, he succeeded. He got better, he had a girlfriend in the end. No, I don\u2019t think it\nwas a total failure. He was one boy out of many. There was another boy I took, a very, very\nbrilliant boy, who I\u2019ve lat -- just recently found as a professor of chemistry in Canada, in\nuniversity in Canada. I looked for many months, years in fact to find him. He had TB of the\nspine, and I wondered if he\u2019d survived. And I -- I took him before a group of headmasters in a\nspecial school in north London, because he was a very brilliant child, and we had wanted a\nparticular standard of education for him. In coming before the headmasters -- it was a team of\nheadmasters, to judge this young man. I had to, of course, to say that the -- he had lost quite a\nnumber of years of his education. Brilliant as he was, he had lost years. And I explained that he\u2019d\nbeen in this camp, and that camp, slave labor, etcetera, etcetera, Auschwitz. And then the chair of\nthe headmasters turned to me and said, \u201cBut didn\u2019t they give them books to read?\u201d And I was so\naghast. I couldn\u2019t believe it, and I couldn\u2019t find anything to say. Sufficient to say that the young\nman was taken into that particular school. But I\u2019ve never forgotten that, and it\u2019s an indication of\nsociety\u2019s capacity to deny what is taking place. But there was also denial amongst the Jewish\ncommunity when I came back from Germany, as to what had happened to our brethren, to our\nbrothers and sisters. And denial can exist in every population.",
        "Q: Why did it exist among Britain\u2019s Jewish population?",
        "A: I think it was partly guilt, that s -- si -- a -- si -- their own survival and other people had not\nsurvived. I -- I shared that. I shared that feeling of -- of having survived when nobody -- you\nknow, when other people did not, and you know, just by the luck of the draw, really. Many of my\nrelatives in Poland indeed had not survived. So -- my father\u2019s relatives. So I think it was partly\nguilt, but it\u2019s also denial. If you deny something, you don\u2019t have to do anything about it. If you\nrecognize something, you have to do something. And you know, I\u2019m faced with this every day,\nin my every day life now. It\u2019s the denial of society to accept that certain people have suffered\nsufficiently to require our attention. And I think that\u2019s what I felt when I came back from\nGermany. It wasn\u2019t just the experience of the camps, of the people, of the ghastliness, of\neverything I\u2019d seen and heard. It was the fact that when I came back I couldn\u2019t get anybody to\neven unders -- want to -- want to understand what had happened. And so this really is my -- my\nmost urgent plea. It\u2019s not only about remembering the past, it\u2019s about preserving the future. And\nwe can only preserve the future if we recognize what we are doing to each other, and what that\nmeans for the victims, and what we need to do if we\u2019re to be a compassionate society.",
        "Q: Little pause here to allow us to --",
        "A: Oh, I thought that was the fi --",
        "Q: When did you finish working with the boy survivors, and -- and what did you do next?",
        "A: I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors. Of\ncourse, there were girls, we always called them the boys, but there were girls. And I continue to\nstay in touch with them. When I say I continue to work with them, the work finished probably\nafter a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to\nwork with them for a number of years after that. And I still see them, particularly one or two of\nthem. But I then went on to do some hospital jobs, social work jobs in hospitals. I joined\nAmnesty in 1961. And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know\nit\u2019s not relevant, except to do with hatred. It was very easy to hate one particular nation, and one\nparticular group of people. And I\u2019d enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for\nmany years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen\nhis family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was\nbeaten to death in the house in which they were on the Kristallnacht. So living with his\ndepression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in Majdanek\nconcentration camp, I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years. But it was\nwhen I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many\ncountries in the world. That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were\ntorturing. That you could not put -- you could not put a frontier up and say this is where it begins,\nand this is where it ends. And I\u2019m not making, and I\u2019m not comparing one genocide, or one cat --\ncatastrophe with another. The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the\n20\" century. But I still feel that we mustn\u2019t close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as\nwe\u2019 ve seen recently, for example, in Rwanda. So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the\nspirits, you know, with the idea that I can\u2019t nurse this forever. I have to accept and have to\nunderstand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to\nunderstand it better. My work in Amnesty went on for many years. I -- I helped to form the first\nmedical group in the British section of Amnesty International, taking testimony and documenting\nevidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who\u2019d come to this\ncountry, and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty. And it was coming out of that -- that\nwork, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply\nevidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human\nrights, including the United Nations, but that we weren\u2019t actually treating the survivors. That\nmade me feel we weren\u2019t really fulfilling our task. And as people were beginning to ask us to\ntake care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different countries who\nlook -- resided 1n this country, and who\u2019d been tortured and violated in many different ways, and\nlost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on.\nWe established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of\ntorture at the end of 1985. And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto. And the\nvision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims. In other words, to take heed of\npeople\u2019s protection, their human rights, to be part of that. If necessary even to be advocates for\nthat, which is not easy for therapists. But also to look at the medical, psychological and social\nneeds of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation. We\u2019ve treated over 35,000\npeople, from over 91 different countries, and I have to tell you that my room every day, my\nconsulting room every day, is filled with horrendous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation,\nof hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from all over the world. And I suppose really, that is the\nbeginning and end, in some ways of my story. I\u2019m doing what I set out to do. I know I can\u2019t save\neverybody. I know that my own skills are limited. We\u2019re an organization with no -- insufficient\nresources to meet the needs of everyone. I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at\nleast our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30\u2019s. People are not welcomed, people are deported\nback to the countries which tortured them. European countries are closing the doors, we have a\nfortress Europe. We don\u2019t look for good solutions. We didn\u2019t in the 30\u2019s and we don\u2019t now. So\nreally, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual\u2019s\nfamily. And that can be very rewarding work, even if it can also be quite distressing.",
        "Q: Is there a thread that directly links your experiences at -- of Belsen with the Medical\nFoundation?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I would have established the Medical Foundation, and worked so long in the\nMedical Foundation if I hadn\u2019t been to Belsen. What I learned in Belsen was about a kind of\nsuffering that we have never really begun to understand, about loss, about grotesque death, about\nthe need to mourn. About -- about despair and the desire to die. I learned all of these things in\nBelsen, but I also learned about the resilience, and something about the human spirit and\npeople\u2019s capacity to survive, and people\u2019s capacity to overcome, if you are able to resource\nsomething within them. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. I didn\u2019t understand how to resource it for\nmany years. But with time, you are able to resource people\u2019s skills, people\u2019s -- you are able to\nretrieve something of who that person was. And that\u2019s very, very important. You are able to deal,\nor to try to come to terms with grotesque death. To find ways of burying the dead that are very\nunusual. And this we\u2019ve had to do in the Medical Foundation. It\u2019s about an holistic approach to\ntrauma, and to loss, using medicine, using psychology, but also using very adaptive measures.\nYou can\u2019t deal -- you know, you can\u2019t bring a very traditional form of therapy very often to\npeople from different -- from certain dif -- from different cultures, from different beliefs in\nhealing. You\u2019ll have to listen to what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative\nways of working with people, and I can give many examples of that, but I don\u2019t think that that is\nthe purpose of this discussion. I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address\ngovernment, it\u2019s home office. It doesn\u2019t always succeed, but it tries. It\u2019s learned skills of\nnegotiation and understanding other people\u2019s difficulties. But how you hold the vision, and how\nyou deal with continuing -- a continuing lack of compassion and understanding, both in the\npublic -- or some of the public, not all of the public, we have quite a following, but in some of\nthe public, and in some of government, is very difficult to do.",
        "Q: Now, on a slightly different tack, but not entirely, one aspect of the work that you\u2019ve done for\nthe Medical Foundation, I believe in June 1993, you went to Israel and you testified on behalf of\na Palestinian prisoner. Could you tell me about that whole case, and your involvement 1n 1t?",
        "A: [ll tell you some of it, because it would take a lifetime to discuss it properly. I went to Israel\nto take part with a colleague of mine who is formerly -- was -- was born in Israel, but lives in this\ncountry and works as a psychologist. I went to attend a conference of the Israeli and Palestinian\nPhysicians for Human Rights. The Medical Foundation does link to various human rights\norganizations. And because of my background, and because of the background of my colleague,\nit seemed very appropriate that we should link to something that sounded as constructive as an\nIsraeli and Palestinian Formation for the Benefit of Human Rights. We knew, and had met the\nIsraeli members of the organization, and the Palestinians. I had known and worked with for\nmany years -- that means to say, when I say worked with, I mean I\u2019ve communicated with a very\nprofound child psychiatrist from Gaza who studied in this country, and is working with the Gaza\ncommunity mental health team in Gaza. So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the\nconference, which regrettably was on the subject of torture. Torture worldwide, torture\nthroughout the world, but torture also in Israel. And when I was there, I was asked by the\nPhysicians for Human Rights if I would help them in the case of a Palestinian where it had\nbecome obvious from the papers that had been found of his interrogation, that he had been\ntortured in order -- in order for him to confess, whether I will be prepared to help them. And I\nmet the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in his case before I made any decisions. And I was\nvery impressed with his integrity, and his dignity, and his desire as an Israeli to provide fairness\nand justice where he felt 1t was appropriate. On reading the document, it was obvious to me that\ncertain forms of what we would call torture had taken place. And I agreed, reluctantly may I say,\nto, as a visiting director of an organization concerned with torture, to take part in a certain aspect\nof his trial. It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the\nlawyers request that I acquiesced to this. And I produced a document, and I attended the court.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side B, of an interview with Helen Bamber.",
        "A: And so we went -- I went with the -- with the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer, and my colleague\nwho had come with me and escorted me from the UK, to Hebrum. It was extremely hot. And we\nhad to wait for many hours because the judge was not happy about my giving any evidence in the\ncourt. And I think that she, quite understandably, had to take advice from other authorities before\nshe could proceed, and she went on really for many hours before eventually, I was allowed to\ncome into the court, and to give only very restricted information. I could not refer to certain\naspects which they considered I was not qualified to refer to. So, my role was rather a limited\none. But I could talk about confessions under torture, and that confessions under torture can\nnever be reliable ones, for quite obvious reasons. That people will often say something in\nextreme discomfort that isn\u2019t necessarily true. And as torture is universally outlawed, it does\nseem rather inappropriate for any court to take, to accept a confession that actually took place\nunder coercion, and under extreme pressure. Before I went to the court, I sat for some time in a\nvery small, hot flat, without air conditioning, to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick,\nsmelly, kind of wooly, wool material, army material hood. I didn\u2019t have such an exact hood, but I\nhad sufficient to give me a feeling of how claustrophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would\nbe. I wasn\u2019t able to adopt the position that 1s adopted, that was adopted, and is -- is often used in\nsuch cases in Israel, where somebody is placed on a low chair, their hands tied behind them, and\nthe chair\u2019s feet are shorter in the front than the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and\nexposed to quite a lot of noise, loud noise, and you are also in this very uncomfortable position,\nsitting on this seat, which has a traditional name, which I shall remember soon, I think if\nanybody were to try that position, they would find it extremely uncomfortable, because the\nweight of the body is distributed in such a way that there\u2019s enormous pressure on the back, and\none is in extreme discomfort and fear, and exposed to noise. Man also had an injury that had\nbeen recorded in the notes, but which I was not allowed to refer to in the court, which was an\ninjury to his nose, which the doctor had recorded. Now, I -- it\u2019s difficult for me to discuss this\nparticular case. It so happens that the case was resolved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an\nexpert in confessions under pers -- under duress, came from the Mordsley hospital as an\nindependent expert, and gave evidence in this case.",
        "Q: A British hospital, that is.",
        "A: Yes, a British hospital. Because, as they professed to be uns -- not satisfied with my\ncredentials as an expert witness, I did suggest to the court, that if they were concerned, as they\nsaid they were, to ascertain whether the man had confessed under torture, then perhaps the best\nway of doing it was to get somebody whose expertise could not be denied. And so this was\nagreed, and eventually an expert, as I say, from a renowned institution, and whose seminal work\nis in confessions obtained under duress [indecipherable] attend the court. And the man\u2019s sentence\nwas commuted. Is 1 -- 1s that the word? From I think 15 years, which was his convicted -- was the\n-- was what he was convicted -- was what he was given on conviction. But I think it -- he w --\ndid -- it was then --",
        "Q: Reduced, or --",
        "A: Reduced to a very short period, and he was released quite soon. It was a very, very difficult\nexperience for me. For me, with my background, to stand in Israeli court, defending a\nPalestinian, who was there, and who looked extremely fearful, and obviously with a -- some --\nwell, was very hard. But it was much harder to do nothing. If had done nothing, I could never\nreally have lived with my principles, which is that nobody, under any circumstances should be\nsignaled out for torture, and that there are other ways. If you do want information, you have to\nfind, with all the ingenuity that exists within societies, other ways. But you do not torture, you do\nnot torture. Torture is such an abominable, devastating experience, both to those who practice it,\nI believe, in the end, and those on who it 1s inflicted. It is really the most terrible memory that la -\n- that -- that man can have. And the nightmares, and the physical pain, the sense of one\u2019s own\nbetrayal -- the body betrays in torture. The body gives out, and the body betrays you in torture.\nAnd for a civilized country, for civilized people to be practicing torture on an individual is\nunforgivable, and cannot be condoned under any circumstances. And I know there\u2019s a great\ndiscussion going on about -- at the moment about whether torture is justified, and others must\nindulge in that. But my views are clear, and my experience of working with survivors 1s that they\n-- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, just as it is with Holocaust survivors to\novercome the effects of torture. And for -- to employ people to torture as your agents is, I think\nthe s -- beginning of a very slippery slope. If you employ people to torture, or to apply as they\nsay, minimum pressure, or whatever the phrase is. It doesn\u2019t matter what the phrase is. What it\nmeans is to frighten through physical and psychological pain into a confession. It\u2019s no way to\nbehave for a civilized society. And there are people in Israel who feel very, very unhappy, very\nuncomfortable about what is going on. And torture does exist, I\u2019m afraid, in -- in Israel. And I\nhave been witness to a number of testimonies of people who\u2019ve been tortured. And it\u2019s an\nunbearable thought, but I think that we have to -- I take heart from the fact that there are people\nin Israel who are working very, very hard to find a way to end this, and who\u2019ve spoken out very\ncourageously. I wish there were more. I know that there\u2019s a great deal of fear, but I don\u2019t with to\nget into the political scene in Israel. People have elected their representatives, and they have\nmade a decision. I with there was not so much hatred against the Palestinians. And I wish the\nPalestinians would not do what they are doing. I\u2019ve worked with moderate, and intelligent, and\ncaring Palestinians and Israelis who come together and want to bring about change, and it\u2019s our\njob to help them do that. Not to be defensive about what is going on there, but rather to look for a\nsolution, I think, as to how we as individuals can assist people to bring about change in their\nsocieties. It is about the way people lose it, yes.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a final question. What lessons can you draw so far from your rather\nextraordinary life?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s extraordinary, I -- I would question that. But I -- I think really, my\nconcern, what -- what worries me most is lack of compassion. I think it\u2019s so easy to turn against\npeople, to create scapegoats. I mean, no -- no nation, no group of people can be more conscious\nof that than the Jewish people, how easy it is for them to be scapegoated. They always have\nbeen, and they\u2019re still being scapegoated. But we have to be careful about this, and we have to be\ninforming all the time, people about the need to understand other people, to be compassionate.\nWe\u2019re not a compassionate society here or anywhere else that I can see. And we can do so many\nthings. We\u2019re now going off to Mars, and to the moon, and here and there, but we don\u2019t know\nhow to maintain compassion. What I saw happen in Belsen was the dying of compassion. There\nwas outrage and compassion when the camp was liberated, but I watched it die. I watched it not\nthere when I came back. And when I speak today to people -- I watched it in hospitals where\nchildren, in my view, were really abused, and restrained, when they should not have been. I don\u2019t\nmean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, really. Stupidly treated. I just -- I just -- I\nmean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees came to this country -- we can question why, but\npeople came to the airports with teddy bears and presents, and there was all kinds of support and\ninterest in their welfare, particularly families with small children. People were able to identify\nthem. But even though they were able to identify them, the compassion is gone. If I say today\nthat my own government is considering sending back a Kosovan family, who we feel, for\nreasons of torture and rape and various other situations, really should not go back, but should be\nallowed to stay, there won\u2019t be that compassion. The compassion has died. And so I don\u2019t know\nwhat maintains compassion. And I don\u2019t know how to help people or to instill compassion in\npeople when they\u2019ve lost it. And I think that is really the predicament for s -- f -- f -- and always\nhas been. It\u2019s about being compassionate to the people who are so different from you. And even\npeople you may not like very much. I mean, I don\u2019t like all my clients, I don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s not\nmy job. I remember when I was in Germany and I said on one occasion to a much more\nexperienced colleague, my God, I\u2019m so tired of -- there\u2019s one particular person that drove me\nliterally -- drove me quite mad, and was very demanding. And he said, \u201cLook, you\u2019re not here to\nlike people. You\u2019re not here to like them.\u201d And that\u2019s quite true. I\u2019m not doing this work because\nI like everybody. And I don\u2019t expect to, and it would be foolish for me to do so. But there has to\nbe a degree of compassion if we\u2019re to deal with the ills of society. I don\u2019t know. I [inaudible]. I\ncan\u2019t finish it. \u2019 ve come to the end. I don\u2019t know, it sounds like a sermon from God knows\nwhere. I don\u2019t intend it to sound like a sermon. It\u2019s not like that, but \u2019 ve watched compassion\ndie so quickly, I just -- it\u2019s just a plea for some kind of understanding that isn\u2019t there.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in North London. My father was born in\nAmerica. My mother was born in the UK, in England, of course, as it was then. Their parents\ncame from Poland and Russia respectively. Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually\nborn, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me,\nOswiecim, Auschwitz. And that sent shivers down our spine many years later. Now, it wasn\u2019t a\nhappy household. My father was an accountant. He was a very obsessional man, and during most\nof my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925. So I grew up in the years of\nunemployment, dole queues, and the rise of fascism. And I think this combination absorbed my\nfather completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary. He could see, I believe, what\nwas going to happen in Europe. He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of\nother languages, and I\u2019ve never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was\nquite simply educated in this country, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages\nhe did, and how he could be bilingual in German. I never understood that, and I don\u2019t now, but\nhe was. So, as an only child, in a house in north London, with diminishing financial resources, as\nmy father\u2019s activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave Nazi Germany\nbecame more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active. And as I was exposed to\nhis version of events, his -- his horror of fascism, his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and\nindeed, in England where we -- I mean, I was frequently aware of Mosely\u2019s fascists marching\nthrough north London, and the east end of London. I\u2019m losing my thread, but what I\u2019m trying to\ndo is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a working class\narea, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous house to something very modest. Was a -\n-a--akind of house of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might\nhappen in the future. My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from Germany, which\nhe would translate. So that as a young child, I -- I was exposed to quite a lot of my father\u2019s\nunderstanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own. N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all\nthis by -- and it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h --\nand as is always the case, she actually couldn\u2019t face the possibility of what might happen. She\nbegan to disengage as much as she could. As my father\u2019s activities became, as I said earlier,\nmore -- more active, there were refugees from Germany who came to our house, en route\nperhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my house for some days, weeks, and -- and\nas a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been\nTB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was\nbedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood. And they -- there were -- people who\ncame and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my bed and talk to me, but they\nwouldn\u2019t talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and 1 --\nyo-you know, celebration. It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened\nin Germany. And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much.\nI found him pompous, although he played beautifully. And he came and sat on my bed\nfrequently. But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood. He said to\nme, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to be ill like this. If you want to, you can get out of bed when I\nleave this room, and you can walk round the room, touch all the furniture, and get back into bed,\nand say to yourself, I am now in control of myself.\u201d Now, I disliked him more than ever when he\nsaid this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues. But I did\nexactly what he said. I got up and I walked round the room, and I touched everything, and I said\nto myself. \u201cI can make changes, I can be in control.\u201d I wasn\u2019t very confident, but I said it. And I\ndon\u2019t know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me.",
        "A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don\u2019t want to magnify it. I was\nvery moved by my father. I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair\nlater on, when the Holocaust came. But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother\u2019s\nsocial skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the piano, and her desire for me to be\nsomehow -- I don\u2019t know, something very special. Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families.\nBut it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really. Later they divorced; when\nI was in my late teens, they divorced. But it was an unhappy household, and I\u2019m not sure that I --\nI mean, I think I had a good role model for my future in human rights. I\u2019m not sure that I had a\ngood role model in terms of relationships, and 1n terms of parenting. I learned, though, as a -- as\nan only child in an unhappy household, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I\nlearned how to compromise. And these, I think, are skills I have. And that comes not only from\nlater experience, but I learned it in the family home.",
        "A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war. What can I say\nabout it? In some ways, it was almost -- it\u2019s crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear\nof be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans\ncame, specially chosen for annihilation. So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing\nincident, when I was fire watching in central London, when central London was terribly bombed,\nand was buried, albeit it -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn\u2019t\nhurt. I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to\ngo downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a solicitor\u2019s office, and standing\non some steps, going down to the basement where all the documents were kept with little bits of\npink ribbon tying them up. And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I\nstood on the top step, the steps collapsed under me. And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from\nthat time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my\nchances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn\u2019t being particularly chosen at that\nparticular time. And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it\u2019s reliefs for me, although it killed, in\nanother bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was\nconsiderably left wing. Did a lot of work in the east end of London, working with the\nCommunists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely\u2019s\nfascists. And she was involved in the much glorified battle of Cable Street, which is an incident\nwhere when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of\nthe east end brought out all their furniture, their -- their pianos, their -- their tables, their kitchen\nequipment, and they blocked the roads of the east end. And for me, with a father who was\ngrowing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to\nme. It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn\u2019t succeed ultimately\nin making a stand, in making a statement. So my aunt was another very strong influence in my\nlife because she represented anything but despair. She was vigorous, she was sexy. She had the\nstrangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter. She was a fascinating, vigorous,\nlovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also\ndoing these fantastic things. An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my\nlife, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fianc\u00e9, someone I think she\nmight have married, were killed when the Caf\u00e9 de Paris had a direct hit.",
        "A: The caf\u00e9 de p -- ki -- the Caf\u00e9 de P-Paris was a very famous caf\u00e9 for dancing, many soldiers\nand people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive,\nbut -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe. I don\u2019t know why people talk about something\nbeing absolutely safe. It had a direct hit. Her body was never found, and I remember going with\nmy mother to try and identify various objects that were lined up somewhere in the middle of\nLondon where people queued and looked at these objects. Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing.",
        "A: I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in\n-- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective.\nHe had read men ka -- \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d he had read other documents. The information actually\nwas there for anyone who wanted to know it. Members of parliament denied all knowledge of\nconcentration camps, and people -- I think including my father, but I\u2019m not sure about this -- did\nlobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don\u2019t think that -\n- that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation. And maybe for\nother reasons as well. So I always knew, I always knew about the concentration camps. It was no\nsecret in my house that people were being taken to concentration camps and murdered. We\nweren\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t always know -- now when I look back, it\u2019s difficult to be accurate. Whether\nthe details were known, I\u2019m not su -- to me, I\u2019m not sure, but certainly the word concentration\ncamps, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my household. So\nit wasn\u2019t a stranger to me.",
        "A: I\u2019m talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war\nyears. The forties. The 1941, \u201942, \u201943, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and\nLondon was being bombed, my father was talking about concentration camps.",
        "A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that\u2019s right, there was an\nexhibition of photographs that was shown in London. It wasn\u2019t the photographs that shocked me\nso much as the attitude of people. And I think that if I\u2019m not mistaken, that the photographs were\ndiscontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people\u2019s reactions.\nNow, I\u2019m not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want\nto believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn\u2019t\nreally -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and\nrationing, and everything else. And to bring home to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that --\nto that extent, I think either didn\u2019t move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it\ndidn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with\nreal under -- I-let\u2019s say how difficult 1t was for anyone to understand what really happened. It\nwasn\u2019t the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to Germany at the end\nof the war. I think that I\u2019d started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I\u2019m -- and in --\nit\u2019s very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the\nmore you think about it, you begin to understand your motives. People often ask me why did I\nwant to go to the camps, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me\nwant to go and to work for the survivors. And I think it really, now talking today, I think it\nwasn\u2019t only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas\neverybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the --\nthe catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the\nconcentration camps, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war,\nI think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing. He also had his own personal reasons\nfor -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad. But I think it was also my aunt, because my\naunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father. And her belief was you must do\nsomething, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to. And so I suppose it was\nmy father\u2019s knowledge, and my aunt\u2019s kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do\nsomething, make a statement, however -- even if you\u2019re waving your arms and nobody\u2019s\nwatching, do it, was what she was about. I think that\u2019s really what influenced me.",
        "A: I found an organization called the Jewish Relief Unit, that was in formation before the end of\nthe war. I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they\nannounced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they\u2019d consider me. And I joined the\nrelief unit in the hope that I would be able to go.",
        "A: The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small office near Woburn House in\nthat square, Woburn Square, or Ensley Place I think was it\u2019s name. It was a -- a house on a\ncorner, and it consisted of an office with about six or seven people in it. It was financed, I think,\nby the -- now I\u2019m not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot\nremember. This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded. I do have a\nbook about it, but I don\u2019t read the book, and I\u2019m not sure why. But anyway, there is a lot of\ninformation about the funding of this organization. And there were people being trained to go.\nAnd these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to\ngo, as far as I know. And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then\nliving with my mother; my father was separated, as I said. And this was going to be quite a\ndifficult issue. I remember sitting in Saint James\u2019s Park, and watching the ducks where I\u2019d met\nmy father, and I said to him, \u201cI -- I want to go to Germany.\u201d And he didn\u2019t really say very much.\nHe said, \u201cWell, you must be sure you want to go, and you\u2019l|l have to be safe and careful.\u201d Which\nhadn\u2019t actually occurred to me at the time, about being safe. Being careful, yes. But he -- he\ndidn\u2019t express great enthusiasm or dismay or surprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast.\nAnd her dreams of what she had expected of me for the future began to disappear to some extent,\nfor her. She saw me taking a path that she really didn\u2019t like, and I suppose as a mother now it\nwas, looking back, it must have been hard for her. But I was very determined to go. And so I\ncontinued to -- to train, to -- to be exposed to a psychologist who in pri -- in small intimate\nsessions would -- individual sessions would ask you questions, but also in group sessions. And I\nsuppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at the time, who -- not all Jewish by the way, and I\nthink that\u2019s important to know. There were several Quakers, people who felt very strongly about\nwhat had happened, who wanted to -- who offered their -- their services. And so that\u2019s what I\ndid, and we went on various training courses, to a kibbutz somewhere in England, in Wiltshire, I\nbelieve, where we undertook various training in map reading and first aid, and -- but I do\nremember -- I do remember one session where we sat in a group and I think it was the\npsychologist asked everyone what they felt they expected to find, and how they would deal with\nthe very impossible situations, and how they would deal with people who they cou -- who felt --\nwho didn\u2019t want to be helped, or were past helping. And I remember searching my -- my th-\nthoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what is the answer to that, faced with a lot of\npeople who you can\u2019t help. And I remember saying that maybe one has to accept that there will\nbe people you can\u2019t save. And maybe if there are children and younger people there, we have to\nput our energies into trying to help them. And that maybe -- this now sounds all rather simplistic,\nbut and maybe if -- if people see the energy going into the young and the children, that would be\nsome compensation for them. I don\u2019t think it was such a bad idea now, looking back, because\nthere were many people that couldn\u2019t be helped. Anyway, that was -- that was what I said at the\ntime.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Well, I-looking at how people are prepared today, say in aid agencies, which still leaves a lot\nto be desired, I\u2019m not sure that we really were prepared so well. It was a disparate group of -- o-\nof volunteers. There were nurses, there were people with a variety of skills at the time. And --\nbut I can\u2019t remember sitting down and really -- th-th-there was just that one discussion we had in\nwhich we were asked to face the possibility of not being able to help everyone, not being able to\nsave everyone. It is important because it stayed in my mind and it -- it\u2019s the situation that I\u2019m\nfaced with every day of my life now. And it\u2019s always hard, it\u2019s always hard and it should always\nbe hard. But it has to be there, that acceptance that you can\u2019t save everyone. But it\u2019s so hard. We\nwent to various -- as I said, we went to this kibbutz, and I remember I drove with somebody in a\nvan, and the idea was that we had to follow the map and find our own way there. And map\nreading and finding our way around with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the\nprovisions to be given. On the -- on the question of driving, and map reading, and knowing how\nto distribute the wherewithal, food, or provisions and so on. I don\u2019t really remember, even with\nthe help of the psychologist, a great deal of help about how we would feel, faced with what we\nwere going to face, which wasn\u2019t only about a d -- a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every\nsense of the word. Suffering from malnutrition, suffering from loss, some behaving as if they\nwere quite mad, all of that. But it was also that we were going to a country that was in rubble,\nand starving. And I certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for the fact -- I\u2019d hardened all these years my heart\nagainst the German people. I\u2019d grown up with a dislike and fear of the Germans. And when I was\non the train going out, on my own, with all my luggage and baggage and God knows what -- I\nmean, what a performance that was, I remember seeing starving German children standing along\nthe railway line, holding out their hands. And I was traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and\neverybody threw out their bread and whatever they had with them to the starving children. Now\nthat I wasn\u2019t prepared for, and that was hard too, because these were children, these were\ninnocent children. And that brought a conflict that I hadn\u2019t -- or an understanding that I hadn\u2019t\nexpected to find in myself. And I learned that the very first moment I traveled. So there were\nmany things one wasn\u2019t prepared for. One wasn\u2019t prepared for the devastated cities. No, we\nweren\u2019t prepared, but maybe there was no way to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I\nthink, how catastrophic was the scene that we were t-to find eventually.",
        "A: My journey remains really a bit of a mystery to me myself. I was then just 20 by the way,\nwhen I went. I think I was -- have to be very careful about this, but I think I just -- I was just 20\nyears old. And I had uniforms, we all had. We had officer\u2019s uniform, we had officer\u2019s rank. And\nan ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear. I don\u2019t know what you call it now. It\u2019s awful that I\ndon\u2019t, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordinary, and I traveled with the yellow star on my\nshoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we had elected to do. And that in itself was an\nundertaking. So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that\nwas like a mobile bath, or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift. And a bedroll\nand all kinds of -- the bedroll was very important later on, by the way. The -- the mobile bath, I\nnever knew it\u2019s -- what it was intended to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty\nunderwear in it because I could sort of snap it together when anybody came into the room. You\nknow, it was one of those things, it sort of opened out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I\ndon\u2019t know, it was a kind of ghastly thing. But it was very good for underwear and you could\nsmack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see. So that\u2019s what I\ndid with that. And there was all kinds of equipment that one didn\u2019t actually need. I think the\nbedroll was very important. So I was in uniform, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m-my khaki,\nmy ghastly shoes and navy blue underwear and -- and the yellow star. And why I traveled on my\nown I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed\nto go. There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I\ndidn\u2019t meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist\nparty, who was not allowed to go. Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew\nand loved her. So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear\nby the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the\nformer concentration camps, or in Holland, or in Greece were somehow either a provocation or a\ndifficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control. Whatever it was, it was difficult. And so\neverybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of\nUNRRA, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government. At least we\nwere in the British zone, that means to say those of us who went to Germany. I had to go -- I\nmean, my final destination was a small village called Eilshausen, which I -- I kept spelling in my\nhead all the time, E-i-l-s. Eilshausen. It was difficult for me. I\u2019d spoke some German by the way,\nbecause I\u2019d learned from my father enough German to get by. And the worst of all was that I\nwent on a train from Victoria -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I\u2019m not\nvery tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me.\nBut of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow\nstar. So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself. Why one was going, what\none was doing. And it was the beginning 1n a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that\nwas always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what\nI\u2019m doing for asylum seekers and refugees. And so I -- I'd already begun then to explain what I\nwas doing with the yellow star on my shoulder. [tape break] Where am I?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I had to explain myself to people as to why I was wearing the yellow star. And people were\ntolerant, the soldiers were good. But when I got to Calais, there was a hold up. The trains to\nGermany th -- were held up. I can\u2019t remember why, whether is was overcrowding. It was quite a\nprecarious journey eventually when I did get on the train because of the bridges, and the\ncrossings. Bridges was dangerous and we all had to stand on one side of the train in order to give\nbalance, which was a bit nerve-wracking.",
        "A: Well, yes, but I haven\u2019t quite got to Calais yet, because I was stuck. Let me go back to Calais.\nI was stuck in Calais for a week, and we lived -- I never took my clothes off 1-in that week, and\nwe stayed in -- oh, what are those huts called?",
        "A: Nissen huts, yes, in kind of dormitories on paliasis and so on. And it was -- it was very\nprimitive, and I remember wandering round Calais all on my own and feeling so alone, as I\u2019ve\nnever felt in my life before. I hadn\u2019t been out of England before, which is strange in this day and\nage, but I had never been out of England. And so this was the first time I\u2019d been out. And I was\nvery alone. Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the train. And I remember\nsomething quite awful about this train because it would always stop at various places which were\nnot a station. I mean, in other words I couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t -- you had no platform, you had to\nget off the train, so to speak, without a platform, in order to go to wherever you were going to be\nfed on the way, which again was a kind of Nissen hut, specially prepared for the soldiers en\nroute. And you would sit at a long table and -- and be fed. And I had the utmost difficulty with\nmy height, in being able to mount this train. And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things\nthat preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about\nthe seriousness of my task, but how in heaven\u2019s name I was going to get up and down this train\nwithout making a complete idiot of myself. And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from\nbehind. But the train ricketed along, and there was one bridge that we crossed when we were in\nGermany, when the German guard, or person on the train came through carrying a lantern.\nAchtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the train so that we actually balanced\nit properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don\u2019t know, that maybe the\ntrain would topple over. Whatever it was, that\u2019s what we all did. And then there were the\nchildren on the way. And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so\nterrified that I would not find myself at this tiny village -- no, it wasn\u2019t Eilshausen, do forgive\nme, Eilshausen was my final destination. The station I had to get out at was Badounhausen.\nBadenhausen, which was a base for British soldiers. And I had to find my way from\nBadenhausen, which was quite a long way, to Eilshausen, which was the headquarters of our\nunit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt -- a former captain in the British army, and who was then the\ndirector of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up our headquarters in the village. And because of the\nfact that I had taken a secretarial course at some stage, and was quite proficient in shorthand and\ntyping, I was for the moment, to be his assistant. And so that was my route, Badenhausen and\nthen on to Eilshausen. I had no idea how I was going to get to Eilshausen. Well eventually I\nmanaged to get out of the station, and I\u2019Il never forget it, it was an extraordinary sensation. I was\nin Germany, I was on a German station all on my own, with all my stuff. And I remember\nwalking down the steps and walking into the street. And I remember hearing German, seeing\nGerman lettering, an-and this somehow German shops and the names of things in German, and\nGerman voices, and as -- a terrible sense of panic. And it was the -- didn\u2019t -- doesn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nhappen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen. And I remember standing there\nand thinking, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know, \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d I\u2019m in the middle of Germany -- it isn\u2019t\nthe middle of Germany, but you know -- I\u2019m in Germany, and I\u2019m with all this stuff. And I\nactually had to get the things down in -- in dribs and drabs. I think somebody helped me because\nI couldn\u2019t carry all the stuff down the steps in one go. I think somebody did help me, and I was\nstanding there. A British officer came up in a car. And of course, this is what happens, and you\nlearn this in post-war situations. There is a kind of help that doesn\u2019t normally exist that you --\nyou suddenly get used to. He drove up and he said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d And I said, \u201cI -- I\nhave to get to Eilshausen.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere the devil is that?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cWell get in the car and I\u2019Il take you to my head -- my HQ, and -- and we\u2019|l try and find out\nwhere Eilshausen 1s.\u201d So I went with him to his HQ in Badenhausen. And you know, I can\u2019t\nremember whether I ate -- I can remember cleaning up, I do remember that. I remember there\nwas some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit. I must have been filthy\nbecause the week in Calais, it was not the most hygienic. And I felt an awful wreck, I remember\nthat. And eventually -- but I don\u2019t remember eating anything at all, except on the train. And then\nhe came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in British war films now,\non a Sunday. You know, very elegant, very beautiful, very well spoken. And he said, \u201cLook, I --\nI\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve found a -- I\u2019ve found somebody who -- we found Eilshausen, it\u2019s a small village, Pll\nget you there.\u201d I\u2019m still conscious of the yellow star. I was very grateful that somehow -- you\nknow, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star\ngoing to do for us out there? Was it going to open doors, was it going to bring hostility? But I\u2019d\nexplained to him what we were about, and he took it perfectly in his stride. And they found a\ndriver for me, and finding a driver and finding a truck in those days was hard work. So I had to\nwait quite a long time, and then I was taken to Eilshausen. And I remember when I got to\nEilshausen, which is a tiny, little village, and I met with Henry Lunzer, and I think he -- he and I\nat that time, at that moment, were the only people there, although some British officers were\ncoming over that evening for whatever, I don\u2019t know what it was. And he was in -- we were in a\ncommandeered house. It was the house of the local Nazi, and that was the kind of way things\nwere done there, that people were billeted in the houses of the former Nazis. And the former\nNazi would have been Nazi leader, I don\u2019t know whether he was imprisoned or whatever the\nsituation was for him. But certainly some of his staff was still around, and I was very conscious\nof that.",
        "A: Oh, I always had encounters with them. I always had encounters with them. I -- I -- my work\ndeveloped whilst I was in -- in Germany, between two camps and the headquarters. One camp\nwas Belsen. The other camp was Kownitz, where I did a great deal of work, probably more than\nI did in Belsen, and Eilshausen, the vil -- the -- the center itself. And it -- it was there, in the\nmain, that I had encounters with the local Germans, although I did have a very angry encounter\nwith somebody once later on, much later on, when I was taking somebody from ORT, the\nAmerican organization, well known, of course, in America, to -- to Belsen. Shall I just tell that\nstory now?",
        "A: We -- one of the things -- and you see, the context is always so difficult, why with me I don\u2019t\nknow, but I had to -- I was in Celle, C-e-double |-e, which is a very beautiful, medieval town -- I\nthink it\u2019s medieval town, not so far from Belsen. And it was my job to remain there, and to escort\nthis Am-American woman who had come -- I think it was ORT, and I was to take her to Belsen.\nAnd as we were eating in the -- the mess, the officer\u2019s mess with other soldiers, and I was talking\nabout Belsen, and this German waitress sort of said very arrogantly in Germany -- and I don\u2019t\nknow why there\u2019s all this discussion about Belsen, we didn\u2019t know anything about the camp. We\nnev -- we didn\u2019t know that there was a camp -- we don\u2019t know what all this talk about Belsen 1s.\nBut she was extremely arrogant, and for the first and only time in my life, I stood up and I was\ngoing to hit her. And I was going to hit her very, very hard. And it was only when the -- the p --\nthe person from ORT could see what I was d -- about to do, that she restrained me, but I -- I have\nnever since felt such violent rage as I felt for that woman. And I do -- I can, amongst all the other\nthings I understand, and I preach about tolerance, about this, about that, I can understand violent\nrage in such situations, because I was out of control, totally. But these servants that we had in\nEilshausen, were German. There was Frau Shermburg and her daughter, who\u2019d come from\neastern German -- Germany, who declared frequently that they\u2019d been raped. Frau Shermburg\nwas the wife of a doctor who\u2019d been killed, and her son had been killed in the war. Her daughter\nwas a nurse.",
        "A: Their role was to provi -- was to cook and help us manage the house. We were very, very --\nwhat\u2019s the word I want? Very correct. We -- Henry Lunzer had been an officer in the British\narmy. He maintained good standards of behavior within the house. Nothing should be broken,\nnothing should be taken that was not ours. If it was broken it had to be recorded as having been\nbroken. We were to be mindful and careful of everything. And Frau Shermburg and her daughter\ncooked and managed the house for us. There was people that came in and dealt with the laundry,\nbecause by the time other people joined us -- I suppose I must have been one of the first, really,\nto go out to Eilshausen because other people joined us later. Harry git -- Grojinsky from the\nGrojinsky bakers came, and he was the officer for provisions and storekee -- stores. And so, as\npeople came, laundry and other things needed to be in place, and a -- and as -- and a group of\nabout I think at least seven or eight drivers, with trucks -- because that was the only way we\ncould manage to move around Germany obviously, there was no transport provided.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say looked after, she -- Frau Shermburg was there to -- to cook, and -- but\nshe was treated well, and I -- and she was billeted -- she wasn\u2019t living in the house, she lived in\nthe village. But I remember there was one scene, a very ugly scene, where she told me that they\nwere being attacked on the way home, for being -- for working with us at the Jewish relief unit.\nAnd she said would somebody escort her. And one of the men in the -- in the unit escorted her,\none of the tall men escorted her -- them, back to their billet. But there was one scene where a\ngroup of very angry people --",
        "A: From the village. They were angry, I think they were drunk. They were very noisy, and they\nwere carrying sticks, and they came to the house outside, and they made a terrible din. And Frau\nShermburg was -- she said these are the peop -- these are people who di -- are going to hurt us if\nwe go. And I, at that time, had been befriended by -- this was much later in my experience there,\nI'd been befriended by somebody from the Jewish Brigade, and I did quite a lot of work with\nhim in Kownitz camp. And he had said to me on one occasion -- he taught me many things, he\ntaught me for example, how to wake up at a certain time, which was my difficulty. I was very\nyoung, and I had difficulty waking up. And he told me that you can wake up any time you say\nyou want to wake up, you can do it. So he taught me that, so that I wasn\u2019t late for things. And --\nbut he also said to me amongst many other lessons, if you meet th -- a kind of -- in a -- a situation\nin which you\u2019re isolated, and a lot of people are at the front door, or wha -- a-angry, don\u2019t come\nout in a posse -- he didn\u2019t use that word, but don\u2019t come out in a group, one of you goes out, only\none. And on this occasion, I think because -- I don\u2019t know whether we were short of people, or\nwhether because I am so short and small, and was quite small -- slender at the time -- not now,\nbut then, I -- I went out, and I opened the door, and I stood by this -- in front of them, without\nsaying anything, with nothing in my hands. And we just looked at each other, and then they\nslunk away. But it was a very important lesson to me. It may not have worked. It could -- it need\nnot have worked. They could have done anything, but they didn\u2019t. And it -- on this occasion it\nworked.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Eilshausen was in Westphalia, some distance from Hanover, I should think about 20\nkilometers, maybe less. It is -- 1t was a very beautiful village. Not so much the village itself,\nbecause some of the houses were modern, you know, spacious, fantastic houses in their own\ngrounds, with a laundry room and you name it. But the walks were brilliant. The woods were\nlovely and we would often walk in the woods. And there was a woman called Frau Mometchka\nwho was German, who had married a Jew, and who died in the concentration camp, her husband\ndid. And she really belonged nowhere. Because of her background she could not live within the\nGerman community. And oh -- because of -- she didn\u2019t quite belong in the house. She was a very\neducated, elegant -- it\u2019s very difficult to be elegant in those circumstances, but very dignified\nwoman in her 60\u2019s, I would think. Tall, upright, spoke a beautiful German, played the piano\nbeautifully, used to play for us. How she came to us I do not know. She was there one day when\nI came back from a mission. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d been. I got to know her very well, she was\nvery fond of me, we used to walk in the woods together. It was beautiful, absolutely -- absolutely\nlovely, with streams, woods, hills. Lovely place. And she would talk to me about her husband,\nshe would talk to me about music, she would try to correct my terrible German. She was very\nmuch a teacher, a scholar. I had a great admiration for her, and affection for her. It wasn\u2019t\nunusual for people to end up in our house with very few questions asked. I mean, it\u2019s very\nstrange, but in those circumstances you don\u2019t ask very often. I don\u2019t ever remember saying how\ndid Frau Mometchka come? I never knew. And I didn\u2019t know how she went, because when I\ncame back from one mission, she wasn\u2019t there. And I said, \u201c\u201cWhere\u2019s Frau Mometchka?\u201d And\nthey said, \u201cOh no, she\u2019s not here any more.\u201d And I never knew where she went, but because of\nthe speed, and the ferocity of everything that was going on, and the anxiety of pri -- everyday\nlife, I didn\u2019t ask, and I never knew.",
        "A: The office was a short distance from the house. It was just a v -- a few minutes walk from the\nhouse up a country lane, and was simply a low, brick building. I don\u2019t know what it had been\nbefore. It looked a bit like a -- a keeper\u2019s house. It -- but we used it as an office. It had obviously\nbeen a house. And I set up there with a typewriter and looked out over onto the fields. And -- and\nthat\u2019s really where the work of the unit was fashioned in that -- in that place. There was a\nGerman man, who\u2019d obviously been close to his master, the Nazi, I think, leader. I took an\ninstant dislike to him, and I would often work in the building on my own. I -- I -- ?ma slow\nworker, and I often -- and I still do it, I work late and long, and I would often be in the building\non my own and he\u2019d be stoking the -- there was like a furnace, an old-fashioned furnace where\nyou burned wood to heat the boiler for hot water and so on. Like a boiler. And he would fidget\nabout the house and I was terribly uneasy with him there. And I found some leaflets in the house,\nNazi leaflets. I asked him to throw them in the fire. There was a whip -- I always remember that,\nthere was a whip hanging up on the wall. Now, that could have been for anything, I mean it need\nnot have had an ominous -- a particularly ominous meaning, maybe they had animals, I don\u2019t\nknow. But it -- 1t made me very uneasy. And I said to him one day, \u201cWhat is that doing there?\nWhy is it here in the house? It\u2019s not something I want to see.\u201d And he said, \u201cHm, it was always\nin the house.\u201d And I -- I said, \u201cPlease take it away, get rid of it.\u201d But he didn\u2019t like me, and I\ndidn\u2019t like him. And Frau Shermburg -- Frau Shermburg looked to me for arbitration and\nnegotiation. She recognized very quickly that I could negotiate for her and her daughter with\nHenry the director, and f-for any facilities that she needed. And that became my role. She would\nshow me photographs of her husband, the doctor who was killed, and her son, standing near the\nArc de Triomphe. And --",
        "A: In uniform, looking very much the Nazi -- well, the -- the German officer that he was. And it\nwas very difficult, it was very difficult. It was a mother showing a picture of -- of her husband,\nher son. She maintained, as did her daughter, and I believe it to be so, that when the Russians\ncame in to where they were living in eastern Germany, they were both raped many times and in\nfront of each other and that -- that was not surprising, the story of rape was very common, both\nin -- particularly within the Russian zone. And you know, these kind of situations, to do with\nwho you are and where you\u2019re born, become very relevant -- and the choices that you make. And\nyou have to ask yourself what choices did she have? On the other hand she didn\u2019t see the\nsignificance of showing me the picture of her son standing near the Arc de Triomphe. I did have\nto point that out to her. It was a -- it was difficult, this relationship with local Germans, very\ndifficult. And I remember looking out of the window one day when a colleague of mine, Edith\nBlau, who\u2019d been in a concentration camp, and who\u2019d been liberated with her mother by the\nRussians, and both of them were living in our house -- as I say, people came and went, and\npeople stayed, and she stayed. And she\u2019s now in this country, in -- in England. And she was\npassing a group of Germans in -- she was in uniform with a yellow star, she became a member of\nour team. And I s -- I was looking out of the window and I saw her strike, very hard, one of the\nGerman women who\u2019d obviously made a remark about the Jews, having seen the yellow star. So\ntensions were high. Strange things did happen. There were stories about Germans putting wire\nacross the streets in order that British soldiers on motorcycle could be decapitated, and that did\nhappen. And it was an uneasy time. You did not sleep easily, let me put it that way. You -- you\nwere aware, all the time, of tensions, of hatred. Your own and others. And that was hard. That\nwas hard, that bit.",
        "A: Well, for the first few weeks of my job, I think, was trying to help Henry to get some sort of\norder into what was a fairly chaotic situation, and to try to formulate some kind of strategy for\nthe administration of a headquarters. I\u2019d never had any experience of that before, but he, being\nan army officer, a captain in the British army, had experienced -- and so I learned from him. And\nwe did quite well, I think; he was efficient. But after just a couple of days we went to Belsen\ntogether. We drove. And a ye -- part of Mrs. Henriekie\u2019s team, she led the first team into Belsen,\nthe first team of the Jewish Relief Unit into Belsen. And her team was there, and I must say I was\nincredibly nervous. It was reassuring being with Henry, but nevertheless, I was very nervous.\nNow, I can\u2019t remember that first day very well. We went to the -- to the concrete blocks which\nhad belonged to the -- oh, to the ger -- German army -- to the -- forgive me, I\u2019Il come back to\nthat. But you know that the people who\u2019d been in -- liberated from camp one, when camp one\nwas burned down, they were taken to the concrete blocks, where the German army had -- had\nbeen billeted.",
        "A: It was the former German barracks, but I -- I -- I do not -- th-the name, it has escaped me.\nSome people refer to is as the former SS bar -- barracks. I\u2019m not sure. But whatever, the people\nwere incarcerated there in the barracks. And the barracks were bleak, they were kind of solid\nblocks of concrete. I can\u2019t remember the lighting. I always remember it as very dim. I remember\ncandles. I remember staying all night one -- on one occasion with s-somebody who died in one of\nthe rooms. And it was over time talking to people in the rooms that bu -- was my first encounter\nwith the inmates. Now, it wasn\u2019t on that first day. That first day was a kind of initiation into the\nwhole atmosphere of Bergen-Belsen at that time. I met the unit -- the workers. I went to camp\none, which had been burned down. I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which\nhad formed the mass graves. It was very -- there was always about that place particularly, that\ncamp one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death. I\nbelieve it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that\u2019s what it was like.\nIt was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling\nthem. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell. And I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\nAnd sometimes I\u2019m reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell. And this\nsense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that space that was empty. There were no\nbodies, there was nothing. There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty\nspace. And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was\nby the side of you. You felt very uneasy. I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went\nthere many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning. They may be\npeople who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the\ninmates, although very few of them went there. But I went there sometimes, and I attended the\nceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory. I believe\nthere\u2019s a picture somewhere of my unit marching. It\u2019s somewhere in the Vina library, and I\u2019ve\nnever been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they\nrecognize me, mainly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason. But I\nreturned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter,\nbecause I remember sleeping in a sleeping bag with all my clothes on in the very cold winters\nthat followed. And what was I doing there? And that\u2019s the difficulty, I can\u2019t really remember that\nI had a particular role as I had in other places. I went and I talked, and I can\u2019t remember anybody\nasking me to do that, or seeing any value in it. So maybe I elected to go. When I knew that a\ndriver or somebody was going to Belsen, which was very frequent, people frequently went there\nwith provisions or with papers, or what have you. There was no other way of communicating\nthan by going somewhere. The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make\ntelephone calls. And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a place. So it is not\nsurprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by\ntalking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v --\na value. That doesn\u2019t sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of\ndeath, destruction, loss. Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who\nwant to die, many of them, but can\u2019t, it\u2019s very important to receive that information in a way that\nsays to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your story. If you can\u2019t tell it, I will be able to\ntell it for you. But all I can be is your witness, I can\u2019t take away the past. Now I didn\u2019t learn that\nquickly, I learned it painfully because I always felt I couldn\u2019t do anything, what am I doing here?\nI can\u2019t take away the past, I can\u2019t change anything. So what is the value of my presence, and why\ndo I keep coming? And I think it was because I began to learn that being a witness, simple and\nordinary and limited as that may be, does have a value to the person who may not live very long,\nand who knows it. And so, I think in a way that was one of my tasks, but why I spent so many\nweeks there, sleeping on the floor, and what work I did with Henry there, or with anybody else, I\nhonestly can\u2019t tell you. I later went back there many times, when I was responsible much later\nfor what was referred to as the TB train. I was sent to nic -- by Henry, to negotiate in Switzerland\nwith a Jewish organization, humanitarian organization for the transfer of young people suffering\nfrom tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery would be very much greater if they were\ntaken to Switzerland to recover, which was one of the ways people treated tuberculosis in those\ndays. And I went to Switzerland and I met this extraordinary woman. And I remember saying to\nher -- I wasn\u2019t in uniform, and I don\u2019t know why, maybe it was politic -- no, to be -- I just can\u2019t\nremember. And I remember saying to her, \u201cWhy -- why -- how did you recognize me?\u201d And she\nsaid, \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t difficult to recognize you, I would have recognized you anywhere, as one\nJew to another.\u201d Anyway, I went with the x-rays, and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe\nme, I\u2019m saying something extraordinary. Because to persuade people, young people, who were\ndesperate to leave Belsen and other camps, desperate to get out, to emigrate to America or to\nEngland, desperate to get out. To persuade them to have an x-ray to identify that they were\nsuffering tuberculosis was the last thing that they wanted.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, they would not be acceptable, and they knew that. And there was all kinds of\nmaneuvering and manipulation of x-rays, and t -- name changing, and I mean it was a nightmare.\nAnd it -- it was a killer, I mean I -- I worked incredibly hard, and I remember losing my voice\nwith the sheer -- you know, the -- the energy needed to persuade people that they wouldn\u2019t be\nable to go anyway, that they would be identified anyway at some point as having the illness. And\nI'd hoped I was right to do that. I wasn\u2019t working alone, I had a -- good advisors, but I had to\npersuade people. And then I had to persuade this -- to go with this delightful woman and\npersuade the Swiss authorities. And I remember a very suave, very beautiful, tall Swiss\ngentleman, who made clear to me, reluctantly, that yes, a certain number of young people would\nbe acceptable to the Swiss, to go to Davose to be treated for their tuberculosis, on the\nunderstanding only that they were -- could recover, and that they could return to Germany at the\nend of their treatment. And that was th -- one of the first political lessons of my lifetime, because\nI learned about the la -- lo -- lack of compassion, I lat -- learned about politics, and in that one\nmeeting, I learned it all. I learned about officialdom, bureaucracy that -- that -- that -- tha-tha --\nthat -- that protects people from the truth, 1t protects people from looking at that sick, young\nperson. And I was very sick at heart myself, I was very upset. But I'd actually got the agreement,\nso I went back to Germany, and then there was an enormous activity on my part, and others\nhelping me, to try to arrange for the evacuation of the young people. And I have pictures of this\nthat can be supplied, to go on what was referred to as the TB train from Hanover station, which\nwas bombed and derelict, catastrophically so, to Switzerland. And eventually -- I mean it was, I\nsuppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn\u2019t feel like a triumph, really. Nothing -- it just felt right,\nI suppose, that young people should be treated eventually after many months, having fought with\nmany officials, British army officials in -- particularly on one occasion, when I needed a\ndocument that hadn\u2019t come. They needed about five or six different permissions in order to leave\nthe camps, from the British military government. And if they hadn\u2019t got all five or six, they\ncouldn\u2019t travel. And in one case I had to go to Dusseldorf, I think 1t was, and persuade them to\nallow a young person in Dusseldorf to travel to Switzerland. And I think we were all day trying\nto persuade them. Finally I think it was only because we offered a lift. We were going to Berlin\nto catch the train, to put the document on the train. I mean, it\u2019s all very primitive stuff. And --\nand I got per -- I think that he was persuaded because we gave a lift to somebody to Berlin. And\nfinally I got the documents. Eventually the train went, but it was made clear to me by UNRRA\nand the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short of one particular document necessary for the TB\ntrain. And that, you know, I would be held responsible for that, that everything was on course,\nthat the TB train would come. It was all arranged by the Red Cross, but that at the last minute,\nthere could be a hitch, and that that was my responsibility because I hadn\u2019t got this document. So\nI remember standing on this train, waiting for it to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation,\neverybody was happy. The children, the young people were laughing and singing and looking\nout of the window, and I was terrified that at the end of the day there would be a hitch. Some\nofficial, some army official would come along and say I\u2019m so sorry, but this is not correct,\nthere\u2019s -- something here is missing. However, it went. And I remember jumping off the train\nand think, my God, it\u2019s gone. And looking at this train -- and you\u2019ve got to picture Hanover\nstation without a roof, with things hanging down, and this train wobbling away, and the kids\nhanging out of the window. And I remember standing there with tears running down my face and\nthinking it\u2019s going to be all right, they\u2019re going to go -- I don\u2019t know what happened to the\nchildren.",
        "A: The people were mainly Polish, Romanian, from eastern Europe. There was one remote\nGerman woman who remained. And the reason, of course, was that most had been killed much\nearlier on. And she would always talk to me about the if factor. If my husband had only done\nthis, he would not have been taken to the gas chambers. If he hadn\u2019t looked in my direction, or if\nhe had kept quiet. Or if -- if -- if -- and this was always the word that people used all the time. If -\n- if only. And this preoccupied people so much, if only. And so you constantly had to ge -- take\npeople back to the fact that it was -- it was totally out of their hands, that there was an\ninevitability about this. And -- but it was such a painful journey to take with people. She spoke\nEnglish I remember. Mostly Polish, some were ruma -- well, eastern Europe. And of course, the\ntwo famous people who emerged as leaders of the camp eventually, and who I got to know very\nwell, was Yosul Rosenzoft, a former lawyer, Polish, and Dr. Bimko, who became his wife.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: I remember people sleeping on the floor, and dressed in old jackets, trousers. Things were\nhanded out, and when we ourselves had supplies of clothes, but they were ill-fitting, and people\nwore anything, so people continued to look somehow ill-kempt, and ill -- ill-fitting, ill-dressed,\nill-cared for. They were emaciated, so very few things really fitted them well. They looked ill,\nthey had a terrible pallor, terrible color. But what you have to, I think, remember, is that people\nsurvive because they are survivors very often. You know, there\u2019s a s -- there\u2019s a reason, there\u2019s a\ncertain something, X factor, that putting chance to one side, where you stand or where you don\u2019t,\npeople do survive. Once they\u2019ve -- they\u2019re into the role of survivor, they do begin to get a\nresilience, and a kind of strength, and so people were fiercely active, fiercely wanting to get out,\nfiercely wanting to organize in some way, and fiercely angry. But people, how did they look\nwhen I first saw them? Ill, emaciated, thin hands. Very thin hands. They had the hands of old\npeople like you -- you see sometimes in hospitals where th-the whole hand di -- hardly resembles\na hand, where the bones stick out, and they used to press their fingers into you very often, in a\nkind of se -- with a sense of urgency they would hold you. And you would hold them, if you\nwere sensible, and -- and you would rock, because rocking was very much part of the way they\nwould present. You would sit on the floor sometimes with people and hold and rock. And people\nwould hold you, and dig their fingers in while they told you their story. And I always -- and I\u2019ve\nsaid in my writings that they spat out their story like a kind of vomit, 1t came out in a hissing\nsound. It\u2019s just barely audible, you -- you often couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying, but\nyou knew, without understanding just by the -- some words, some snatches of things. You were\nnever alone with anyone. There were always people there. There was always people around, so\npeople would often ch-chime in, and -- and come up with something. But I -- I was alone with\nthe German woman, and I can\u2019t remember the circumstances, and I\u2019m just hoping -- I don\u2019t think\nit was at ca -- you see, I spent a lot of time in the camp of Kownitz, but I\u2019m sure it was Belsen\nbecause in -- in Kownitz they were mainly Hungarian, and in Belsen I think, for some reason, I\nwas more alone with her. And she told me about her husband, and it was very pitiful. But people\nsoon -- soon began to resemble some form of normal kind of appearance. Their faces would fill\nout, their stomachs would protrude because I think it\u2019s part of malnutrition. You don\u2019t suddenly\nbecome -- you don\u2019t fill out properly, you fill out chaotically. And particularly with the younger\npeople. But I remember some young adolescent boys, and they looked like any young kids from\na village, with caps and ill-fitting clothes, and they didn\u2019t look so unusual after some months.\nPeople recovered, and they recovered slowly. Those that were going to die, died very quickly, I\nbelieve.",
        "A: Yes, I do. The day I arrived in Belsen, we were told that a woman who\u2019d had a -- a child by, I\nthink a Ukrainian guard, had drunk Lysol, and her -- poured the Lysol down the throat of her\nchild, and they both died. And it -- it was horrific. And it was -- yes, it\u2019s strange I didn\u2019t\nremember that at first, that that was so important. But we all block. And there was a sense of real\nhorror and upset amongst the workers about this woman.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know. I only know how it affected the workers, and it was -- it felt like a sense of\nfailure, like it does with all carers, who care for people who take their lives. You feel you have\nfailed them. So, there\u2019s a kind of so-called reasonably normal response in a totally, totally\nabnormal situation.",
        "A: I think we often lacked supplies. I remember on one occasion we were waiting for some\nsupplies to come, and eventually a -- a truck arrived at the -- our headquarters. And it turned out\nto be a traveling synagogue and didn\u2019t have the supplies that we wanted. And those of us who\nwere less religiously inclined had quite a lot to say at the time, including myself. We were\nfurious, and very upset. Oh, so much for what people feel you need. It was -- I mean, a lot of\nsupplies were coming in. ORT was very good. There were other American organizations\nbringing in supplies. And we ourselves did have supplies and we did man the hospital in Belsen,\nwhich was run, I think, by one of the nun\u2019s sisters, who was a m -- a nurse. Henry Lunzer --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, and she was running the hospital there. And I remember her showing us around\nthe hospital, and the hospital was called the Glen Hughes Hospital after Brigadier Glen Hughes\nwho reli -- who liberated Belsen, and who was, I believe, a remarkable man. What can I say\nabout the hospital? I think I learned -- I learned so much in those months I was in Germany. You\nknow, I think what I -- I learned, looking at what was going on in that hospital -- you\u2019ve got to\nremember that nurses of the 30\u2019s and the 40\u2019s were brought up to believe in everything being\nabsolutely pristine, to be -- you know, to have sheets that are tightly drawn, to have -- you know,\nto have everything clean, and -- and cared for. And again, it\u2019s like all the bureaucracies -- I mean,\nI do understand it, it -- it is -- the idea of chaos 1s always frightening, but chaos can sometimes be\nquite healing. And what I thought was very good, was when I watched people helping their own\npeople. By that I mean maybe relatives, maybe friends, maybe a child, somebody feeding their --\ntheir relative, or their friend. And it would be a mess. The cl -- the cl -- the -- the bed would be in\na mess. Their trembling hands would never quite reach the mouth appropriately and there would\nbe mess all over the bedclothes, and -- but -- but there was a to -- it was noise, and there was\nbustle, and there was a sense of activity. And I think that that is far safer for healing than the kind\nof -- the preparation for -- you na -- this sort of -- you being prepared for death with your white\nsheet tucked tightly round you, and I\u2019m simplifying something very much, and I must be\nforgiven for that, because there 1s a place for order in a hospital scene, and many people do ask\nfor it. But there are situations in which chaos and care can match, and can bring about solutions.\nAnd when I started, many years later with a group of other mothers, an association for the\nwelfare of children in hospitals, so that mothers could go into hospital with their small children\nunder the age of five, I remembered all the time the lessons that I\u2019d learned in that hospital. And\nthat is that sometimes it\u2019s better for a bit of chaos if you are looking after your child, and the\nsense of care and love is there. And there will be people who will disagree with me about this,\nand people who will remember everything about Belsen differently than I do, but I was only 20\nyears old, impressionable, taking everything in and not all of it may be as coherent as the listener\nwould wish.",
        "A: I think I was all -- you know, I don\u2019t remember approp -- this sounds rather self indulgent, but\nI don\u2019t remember a proper childhood. I remember being a very grown-up child. Not willingly,\nbut somehow forced upon me by circumstances. I was always very serious, although I enjoyed\nfun, and I enjoyed fun when I was in Germany with my comrades. We had lots of fun and\nlaughter, like one does in extreme situations. But -- I mean, you -- it -- it\u2019s difficult now to -- to\nbe honest, and to say did I absorb all that then, or have I somehow taken it in and absorbed it\nslowly over the years? And there may be something in the latter, because every time I look back,\nI realize of things I learned, and maybe I didn\u2019t realize at the time I was learning about human\nrelationships, about everything, and about hatred, about love, everything was encapsulated in that\nexperience.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember trying. I remember moving into the blocks and talking, and being a ve -- and\nsort of sitting on the ground. I mean, don\u2019t misunderstand, as people became stronger, they\nbecame angry, and you, being the carer, you being the provider, would often become the target\nfor people\u2019s anger, because you could not provide the answers. So I think with the creativity that\nexisted amongst some of the survivors, and our own need to feed into that, we were able to\nsupport some of the things that were going on. For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and\nsomebody called Norbert Fallheim, who later committed suicide, formed a committee within the\ncamp. They were representatives of the camp. We were the next sort of go-between between\nourselves, between them, and UNRRA, and the military government. So we would naturally,\nwhilst we were supporting what they were doing, at the same time we would become the\nrecipients of much of their anger. And I can remember sitting in an old Merck car that had been\ncommandeered from somewhere by somebody, sort of closely packed in at the back with\nNorbert, and Yosul, and somebody else, and myself desperately trying to take notes with Henry\nand somebody else in the front, while they were raging and ranting and very angry indeed. About\n-- but you see, curiously enough, I think it was a relief because it was human, and it was life.\nAnd it was such a relief from the desperate, dejected, huddled figures. You know, sometimes\nwhen I used to go -- when I first started to go into the rooms, people didn\u2019t look like human\nbeings, they -- th-they were all kind of like a huddle of clothes sitting there. It was quite horrible,\nbecause it was dim, and y -- and you couldn\u2019t always identify nu -- it -- and here were people\nshouting about what they wanted, and being very angry, with us, with them, with everybody.\nAnd in a way, although I felt very vulnerable sometimes, at being shouted at, I also was a go-\nbetween in my familiar familial pattern, between them and my own hierarchy, between them and\nHenry. And so they would come to me, either in Eilshausen, and they would ask me to negotiate,\nand they would complain about Henry, and then they would complain to Henry about UNRRA,\nand then all the rest of it and so on. Because of course, what they wanted more than anything else\nwas freedom, and they hadn\u2019t got it. I mean, I\u2019m making it sound as if I understood it all, and I\ndon\u2019t think I did. I think it\u2019s only with hindsight that I can talk about anger as being something\nvery positive. But it\u2019s something that makes you feel alive, whereas when I used to see the\npeople huddled, and I thought to myself, I wonder if they\u2019re going to die, th -- I'd -- I -- I think I\njust felt that I could do more in that situation of vigor and anger, and -- and vision, because they\nhad a vision of what they wanted.",
        "A: Well, they wanted out. They wanted out of the camp. Some people wanted -- you know, this\nis a difficulty now, this is a big difficulty, because people talk about the formation of an\norganization that was -- whose aim was Palestine. Now, my recollection is that there were many\npeople who wanted to go, for one reason or another, either to America or to England. And\nobviously they couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s very little different than it is now, really. I don\u2019t think you could get into England\nunless you were sponsored by a relative or friend, and sponsored quite energetically. You had to\nbe able to provide for that person completely and absolutely. And one or two people did go from\nKownitz. So I don\u2019t remember anybody going from -- from Belsen. And others wanted to go to\nAmerica, and I\u2019m sure some did. And some people did come to -- to England. But there were\nmany -- the majority didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t. And I think it was only with the realization that nobody\nreally wanted them again -- yet again. That no -- that the doors were not opening generously to --\nand -- and -- and with -- what\u2019s the word I want? Like, with countries joining together in order to\nprovide a solution for this group of people, who remained there, some of them, until 1950.\nWhich is a very long time from 1945. So it\u2019s not surprising that people became more militant and\nmore determined that Palestine was the only solution for the Jewish people.",
        "A: I mean, I was very involved with Henry in trying to negotiate for better facilities within the\ncamps. And withi -- and within groups where Jewish people had -- had -- had come and were in\nneed of provision, and -- and -- and support. And so we would be writing and Henry would be\nmeeting -- I might accompany him with others, to try to negotiate, either with UNRRA or with\nthe British government for better facilities here, and better facilities there. I would write endless\nletters, and I would be -- spend a huge amount of time screaming down the telephone because the\ntelephones did exist, but it was almost impossible to hear anyone, and you would spend hours\ntrying to get somebody, and it made such a difference because otherwise you just had to get ina\ntruck and go. So I would do normal secretarial work in support for Henry. I would accompany\nhim, particularly where Yosul and Norbert was concerned -- were concerned. But I spent a lot of\ntime -- and this again is something I'd -- I can\u2019t put -- I can\u2019t be too correct about, because I\nsimply can\u2019t remember. I went to Kownitz camp -- what happened at Kownitz was that -- and I\ncan\u2019t even tell you exactly where it 1s --",
        "A: There were mainly women, there were some men, but there were li -- a large number of\nHungarians -- Hungarian woman, but there were some young men. And we got a telegram to the\nunit, which -- which I -- it came to me, saying that -- that they were desperate, that they had no\nprovisions, no means of support, that -- that there was this camp, and there was nothing and they\nwere desperate.",
        "A: A lot. I don\u2019t remember the number, and I can\u2019t tell you the number. It was quite -- it must\nhave been about 600 - 700 people, I think. And I went there, but I don\u2019t remember with whom. I\nwent there with somebody and we had a meeting in a room, up some stairs, wooden stairs with --\nthere were only candles, it was very cold then, very cold.",
        "A: The first. I just wish one could remember more, who was with me. And I went back with\nwhoever, and negotiated for provisions, for supplies, for acknowledgement that this camp existed\nand needed, you know, the support of UNRRA and other facilities, as well as our own. But then\nthey got -- was a -- was a situation in which I would go very frequently to the camp, and that\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be acknowledged by anybody now who can remember. Neither Henry, nor\nAllison Ward, with -- who was our personnel officer, and who 1s still alive. Both are still alive.\nNeither have a clear recollection of Kownitz. Allison said yes, she remembers that I used to go\noff frequently with this former Hungarian Jewish Brigade leader, and that we would work there.\nBut I can\u2019t tell you how it was, whether I elected to g -- I know I must have elected to go because\nI was there so often. I was there for their first Pesach, which we had in the open. And I remember\nwe atrived late, and they were quite fed up with us for being late, and they had to carry me across\nall the tables, and there was enormous hilarity about that, as I was carried aloft across tables. And\nI got to know them very well. But they needed a lot of support, they were young women, who\nwere very beautiful many of them, who were very si -- very vulnerable. Who the person I was\nworking with was very anxious to protect from the sexual advances of any soldiers. And I\nremember a very moving discussion in which he spoke, and said -- and I was so touched that in\nthe middle of Germany, in the middle of all this mess, a camp that was mud, you were up to your\nankles in mud at the time -- or later, because 1t was snowing then, but he -- he spoke to the\nwomen and told them, you must preserve yourself. You\u2019ve been preserved for a reason. I can\nremember it to this day. You\u2019ve been preserved for a reason. Don\u2019t destroy yourselves, don\u2019t\ncapitulate to men who find you beautiful and who want to give you chocolate, and who want to\ntry to help you, and maybe not help you. He was really telling them, you have a sexuality which\nyou\u2019re only just realizing because in the camp your hair was cut, you didn\u2019t have your periods,\nyou now do -- but he didn\u2019t say this in so many words. But he gave this very moving talk to\nthem. I was so touched by this, and thought it was so wonderful that -- that we should be talking\nthere, preserve yourselves somehow as a woman, and as women. And it\u2019s important. And then\nwe danced, I remember we did lots of dancing.",
        "A: Oh, anything, we just danced. We danced the hora a lot, and -- hora, and then we -- there were\npeople who knew various variations that I\u2019d never seen before, that were fascinating. And lots of\nsongs and wonderful, it was wonderful the way -- it was full of life. I met two of the woman\nlater, here. And they\u2019d managed somehow. But 1-it\u2019s -- I-I don\u2019t know what we were trying to do\nthere, we were trying and -- 1-1-it was such a unsupported group of people, and it was so\nprimitive. I think 1t was a very primitive camp. Somebody once described it as a very good one. I\nthought it was very primitive. I remember there was a sort of wooden toilet, you know, one of\nthese open jobs, and sort of just by the side of the camp, and you know, you had to have people\non guard when you went in there, because there\u2019s no way you could fasten the door, and it was --\nit -- that place was cold and primitive. We got supplies in, we got learning material in. We did\nsomething. We did our best.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or\nvictim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which 1s a sort of\nanonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum\nseekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used. So the\ncompassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the camp was\nliberated, had gone, in my view. And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number\none. So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a\nnuisance, a -- a problem. They were vocal, they\u2019d become articulate, they had their committee,\nthey were demanding, they wanted rights. What wa -- what rights did they want? They wanted\nrights within the camp, as far as I remember. They wanted rights of travel. They wanted to be\nable to move about Germany. And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this -\n- this can be corrected by others, the people in the camps were not allowed to leave or to travel\nwithout special permit. Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went\nparticularly, as I remember, to Poland, mainly to try to find their relatives. They went to their\nold, former homes to find their relatives. When they got there, they were set upon by the local\npeople, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place. And the\npeople, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into\nGermany, and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the camp. I use barbed wire as a -- as\na -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration. So their options were very limited. If they\nwanted to find their relatives -- and this was at the beginning, for the first year or so was the most\nimportant as I remember it, was the finding of relatives. Now we had set up a search bureau in\nBelsen. And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing\nwas to set up a search bureau. People who would come to the camp, again presumably illegally\nbecause they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or\nto leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper. It was probably cigarette paper,\nwith the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so? And the names\nwould be on these little bits of paper. And they would give them to you, or they would give them\nto anybody. They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best.",
        "A: I\u2019m not well acquainted with the search bureau. The search bureau presumably tried to marry\npeople through the camp, or through other means, relatives of the named person, so -- on the\npiece of paper. So, it did it\u2019s job. Whether it did it adequately, I can\u2019t say. It was primitive. But in\nsome cases people were reunited. There were other search bureaus that were established as time\nwent on. I\u2019m not quite sure if the Red Cross was not involved also in trying to reunite people.\nThat also can be confirmed. I have -- you -- you know, I have a very fragmented,\ncompartmentalized memory of this particular period of my life. So I can\u2019t really speak with\nauthority about the organization of the search bureaus. I know that there were several, I know\nthat we had one in the camp. And I know that people came searching for their relatives, handing\nbits of paper to each other in order to see whether somebody remembered somebody. It was\npathetic, and very sad. Full of pathos, very sad to watch.\nYou said that some of them wanted to go home, for example, to Poland, and what became of\nthem.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: I think my memory 1s of people wanting to come, many of them, to England or to America.\nThere was no means by which they really could simply ask to come. I\u2019m not sure if the\nAmerican quota system was operating in the way that it normally does. In other words, so many\nfrom -- you know, that you\u2019re on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish.\nBut what I do know was that it wasn\u2019t possible simply to enter the US, or the UK, not really.\nSome people did, and they\u2019re very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have\ndone it, but they must forgive me, I don\u2019t believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise\nthey would have done it. I-It\u2019s -- 1t was hard for people, they couldn\u2019t get out, and they couldn\u2019t\ngo anywhere. They couldn\u2019t go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn\u2019t go to the Iron\nCurtain countries. They knew that they would be badly treated if they did. They knew what was\ngoing on by returnees. And so what were their options? To find their relatives, to -- but then, as\nthe months passed people realized that nothing had happened. Perhaps they had found a relative,\nperhaps they\u2019d accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive. Or they lived in hopes, but they\nstill wanted to get out. Outside the camps, of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to\nfraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various zones. And this came very\nhard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was\ngoing on outside. I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many\nthat they were not wanted. That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their doors. I\nmean, many people returned to Holland, some maybe to France. But on the whole, people\nremained, and they didn\u2019t want to. So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha\n-- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that 1 -- I believe that it was then that the\nidea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to Palestine is the only solution for their problem.\nAnd I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission. So\npeople began to learn Hebrew if they didn\u2019t already know it. They became more militant. There\nwere the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to Palestine one way\nor another. And of course, many people perished on the way.",
        "A: What did I know? Well, everybody knew that it was happening. It was no secret. An\norganization grew, an organization of -- I\u2019m not giving it a name, I don\u2019t know it -- whether there\never was a name, but you know, with all these situations of -- of despair and need, a militancy\ngrows, an urgency grows. People are not going to stay in that situation forever. And historically\nthis has always happened. It\u2019s happening now with the Kurds, and it\u2019s happened elsewhere.\nPeople want something for themselves, and they want freedom and safety. And people will, if\nthey\u2019re not allowed to negotiate for it, they will try to take it. And so people began to go\nillegally, and cross frontiers illegally. And transports from the camps were organized.",
        "A: And Kownitz, yes. Mm.",
        "A: I know -- I know relatively little about the transports. They were small. People didn\u2019t go in\nlarge numbers, to my knowledge. I remember one particular incident, let me concentrate on that.\nWe were told at the -- our headquarters that -- or we found out somehow, that there were a group\nof I suppose about 15 to 20 people being held in a British army post. And I can\u2019t tell you where it\nwas, but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the Dutch frontier illegally and they\nwere now being held, and had been held for many months in this camp. And in this camp, when\nwe eventually got there, we found that the camp was also a holding place for infamous war\ncriminals and Germans who had -- who -- with a -- with a poor reputation. So I went with the\nleader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one lorry, and I think, too, we had another lorry with --\nor truck, large truck, which would house another group, and a small, kind of mobile ambulance\nwhich was intended for the pregnant woman who was quite near term. So I think we probably\nhad a nurse with us. I can\u2019t remember that, but I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be\nnecessary or prudent to just have the ambulance. So I think we must have had a nurse with us. So\nthere were several of us, and when we got to the camp, the lorries stood in the comp -- in the\nmain kind of open area, bef -- we -- we came into an open space. On the left of us was this open\ncamp site with barbed wire, in which the Germans were standing or pacing. And there was one\nwoman, whose name I think has been given as Irma Grace, but I\u2019m not sure if it was she, and I\nwill check that for the record, but it was definitely a woman of -- who was well-known for her\ncrimes. And -- and when the lorries stopped, and we were to get out and go and negotiate with\nthe British post, the inmates, the German inmates started to chant. They realized that we had\ncome for, in inverted commas, the Jews. And they began to chant, and it wasn\u2019t a very friendly\nchant. Something similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out with the Jews, but nasty stuff. I can\u2019t remember\nthe exact words, but it was very ominous, and the whole scene was very ominous. And as we\nbegan to -- as we negotiated, and we received the people, and they were walking towards the\ntruck, and we were loading them onto the trucks, the chanting got louder, and louder, and louder.\nAnd my colleague said, \u201cStart them singing, get them singing.\u201d And so they started to sing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm. And so, rather reminiscent of that film with Ingrid Bergman and -- you know, that\nfamous \u201cCasablanca\u201d thing, but not dissimilar may I tell you, because the singing got louder and\nlouder, and the chanting got louder, and it was extremely unpleasant. And I\u2019ve never -- that\nscene, I -- I will never forget, because of it\u2019s ominous nature, it\u2019s pure, unadulterated hatred that\nwas present, and the kind of slightly banal, rather semi-amused laid back attitude of the British\nsoldiers from whom we were collecting the former inmates. And they were from Kownitz, I\nthink. And we took them in the trucks, and the proud, pregnant lady haughtily rejected the\nambulance, and was most affronted. So the ambulance, it trailed behind, and we had our two\ntrucks and we took them back. And it -- th-there was some exuberance I remember, some --\nsome sense of release, relief. And there was a lot of singing, but people were tired, and\nexhausted, and it was a long drive, I remember. And I remember that there was a boy, young\nboy, and we held out our arms to help the people out of the -- out of the lorry, and he refused\nthat, and he jumped down. And I -- I talked to him for a little while. And when we got back into\nthe truck -- because people needed to relieve themselves, I think we had food as well, we got\nback into the truck, this young boy, as we dropped him off in -- in the compound in Kownitz said\nto me, \u201cYou will remember me. Remember me.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019Il remember you.\u201d And I\nstayed in Kownitz, I -- I don\u2019t know where or how, I can\u2019t remember where I slept. And I asked,\nI think, several days later where the group was, and I was told that they\u2019d gone off again, and\nthat this time they had crossed the frontier and they had got away. So not, I think, the pregnant\nlady. I don\u2019t remember. Well, it may have been, but whatever, they had gone. So yes, there were\ntransports, and they behaved as all people do in these situations, with incredible determination\nand much courage. Many died. Some were shot crossing the frontiers as well. But more than that,\nI don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t say.",
        "A: You know, I\u2019m not quite -- to be honest, I\u2019m not quite clear about what people did all day as\nfar as the inmates were concerned. I think -- it wasn\u2019t a camp that I worked in day in and day out.\nMy impression 1s that they did very little at the beginning because they were so vulnerable, so\ndebilitated, it would be difficult to imagine an actual activity. I believe that the more orthodox\ngathered and prayed, and went about their devotions. And I\u2019m sure there was some activity, but\nthere was very little structure to the camp as I remember it. It was the emergence of Yosul\nRosenzoft and Norbert Fallheim, and the establishment of a committee many months later. And\nalso with the presence of ORT providing workshops. And I do have, and I w-will have to donate\nit at some time, a small pot, a small vase from some metal that was found somewhere, which\nsomeone gave me, which is one of the f -- one the early products of the er -- ORT workshop. So\npeople began to occupy themselves. They began to form into their political and religious\ngroupings. The theater was established and became one of the liveliest and the most exciting\nexponents of resilience and life in the camp.",
        "A: Well, the theater would start with, nearly always as far as I remember, with a very raw just\nsort of exposure on the stage of the destruction of a family. The scene would start with the\nmother, father and children sitting round a table, very familiar table. And you can see that they\nwere joyful, that they were engaged with each other, arguing, discussing, etcetera. And then you\nheard the marching toward the door that would open on the family in which the Germans would\ncome. And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the\nmother being dragged away. The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was\nplayed time and time and time again. And it would be received in absolute silence. It was the\nhomage to the family, to the destroyed family. Whether it was a form of mourning, I\u2019m not sure.\nIt could -- it could have been. It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the\nworld know this is what happened to my family. I think it was more that than mourning, because\nit\u2019s my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque\nhappenings as those that they witnessed and were part of. So I think it\u2019s probably to do with -- to\ndo with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it. And as the\nmilitary government and -- and officials from UNRRA were often invited to th -- these concerts.\nNot always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it\u2019s not surprising that they would\nwant to say this. This 1s, or was my family, and this is how it was for me. It was incredibly\nintimate, and terrible to watch. And there was never any applause, there was only silence. But\nthen there would be other things taking part. I don\u2019t remember all of it, but I remember that very\noften there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or\nPolish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the\nBritish rule, the British command and the British zone, the attitude to the camp. There would be -\n- and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of\ncourse, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army,\nwho\u2019d hadn\u2019t understood a word of this cabaret. And I think the cabaret was done very much in\nthe old-fashioned kind of really sort of German style cabaret. You know, it was ironic, it was -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s meaning was very, very clear, and I believe it was very, very clever. I didn\u2019t always\nunderstand it all. And so the theater was very important, the hospital was important, the\nworkshops, the committees. The constant badgering for different individuals to move or do\nsomething, to go somewhere within Germany for whatever reason. Other than that, I cannot\nreally -- I cannot really remember other activities.",
        "A: Oh yes, there was a newspaper, of course there was a newspaper. Yes, there was a newspaper\nproduced with again, factual and ironic comments about the life of the DP, and the life of Belsen.\nAnd -- and so on. No, th -- th -- there\u2019s a newspaper, I wish -- I wonder if there\u2019s ever any of this\nleft. \u2019' ve never seen anything. So much was of the moment, and you don\u2019t think in terms of\nhistory, which one should. Anyway, that\u2019s how it was, as far as I remember.",
        "A: Yes, it was. It had its spirit, it had its resilience, it had its sense of life. And I think that there\nwas a group of younger people there who were going to survive at all costs. Somehow survival\nand strength meant a great deal to them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea\nof Palestine as their solution. Whether the Palestine or the Israel that we see now would have\nbeen different, I believe it might, but others don\u2019t agree with me. Had Britain and America taken\npeople more readily and quickly, and quickly solved this question of people remaining within the\ncamp that once abused them -- I mean, there\u2019s nothing much worse than that, really. Pretty awful\nstuff. I don\u2019t know. It may be a very simplistic way of looking at a very complex problem. But\nthe sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent. And I\nhave seen it elsewhere.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: I find it difficult to make claims, I always do. I think that we were part of it. We were part of\nthe res -- I don\u2019t want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac --\nsomething of the restoration of the human spirit. We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the\npeople, something of the spirit. Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed\nand performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways. I\u2019m not taking\nresponsibility for it. I believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support\nand resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular\nindividuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean. I\nmean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had\nquite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was\nhelpful. The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that\n-- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on\noccasion by myself, but I don\u2019t want to make too many claims about what we achieved.",
        "A: I think the hospital was important. I think -- I -- I had less to do with the hospital, but I think\nthe hospital was valuable, and did a great deal for the individuals.",
        "A: Mm, mm.",
        "A: Well, it was -- 1-it was a place for recovery. And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it\nwasn\u2019t a German hospital. It wasn\u2019t a British hospital ostensibly, it was somehow manned by\nJewish people helping Jewish people. And I think that was very important because you are very\nvulnerable when you are helpless. And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless\nvictims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything. And I think\nwhatever else we did or didn\u2019t do, we did operate it well. I believe that. So I think that was a\nplus. And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something. But if you\nask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don\u2019t think we\nwere responsible. I think it came from the resilience of survivors. Had we not been there it might\nhave been more difficult, let me put it that way. That might be the fairest way to put it.",
        "A: I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic,\nbut what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody\u2019s hand. I -- I\nfound that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work. When\nthere\u2019s nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody\u2019s hand\nand stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication. So\nyou don\u2019t begin with words, you begin with touch, and that\u2019s all. And sometimes I would just\nwalk away. And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day. But it\nwould be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so\nexhausted, that to take somebody\u2019s hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person,\ntrying to give strength, as it were, to the other person. So that was all I could do sometimes.\nWords came later.",
        "A: Sometimes people would simply come out with a whole story in explosions. I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve said\nbefore like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something. So that 1t would come out stacat -- come\nout in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way. And I would sometimes say either in\nGerman -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in\nYiddish words that I\u2019d learned, as much as I could, if I couldn\u2019t understand somebody, because\nthere would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to\nunderstand the story. So that again is a form of communication. The fact that you don\u2019t\nunderstand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you.\nWithout them, I can\u2019t understand that person. So that\u2019s always a very useful way of looking at\nthings, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you. And I would\nask for help from them.",
        "A: Yes, well then, I mean, this 1s something you get in all -- with most survivors and something\nthat you get y -- I -- I have to get used to in my present day work. People are angry because they\nare helpless and frightened and -- and they can\u2019t see a way out. And you just have to let them\nshout and be angry. There\u2019s nothing else you can do. You don\u2019t walk away from it.",
        "A: I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization. It\nwas born of it\u2019s time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things\nthat they couldn\u2019t achieve. So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more\ndifficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the\ninstitutions rather than for the people they\u2019re there to help. So we would look at, if we met in the\nevening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a car being stolen,\nor an accident. But we wouldn\u2019t talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt. So there wasn\u2019t much\nof that. What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that\nhouse, that requisitioned house. We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to\neach other. We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and\nRichard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of\nperforming on the stage which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say? Little bit\narrogant and pompous. And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor. And so he would\nsing and perform and we would all act out something. Or we would dance. Now we would\ndance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this. We\u2019d put on something or\nother. We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can\u2019t even\nremember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen\nto music. So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think,\nin the evenings, but we didn\u2019t talk about our feelings. So my main relief would be laughing at\nsomebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter. And we\u2019d have all those\nsort of activities, which was fun.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t despair at the time. When I came back to Britain, when I came back to London, I\nwent through a very difficult phase, one that I haven\u2019t experienced since. I -- I can\u2019t explain what\nit was, it was an inability to work with what I\u2019d seen. I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of\nthat kind of happening, I was terrified of it. And I was sure that it was going to happen again.\nAnd I don\u2019t know why I felt that, but I felt afraid. And I used to go to the cinema and sit and\nwatch film after film after film. And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel\noverwhelmed with fear. So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when\nI had come home. And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in\nunderstanding or listening to what I had to say. That was very difficult for me. I\u2019d learned a lot\nof negotiating skills in Germany, and in my family, but I hadn\u2019t learned how to deal, and I still\nfind it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don\u2019t know, who don\u2019t\nwant to hear, and who didn\u2019t want to hear. And I couldn\u2019t bear it. I came back to a country that\nwas preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and\nany effort I made on my part to communicate what I\u2019d seen, even when I was asked to give\nofficial talks about it -- I remember going to the east end and talking in a theater there to people.\nI was actually asking for money, and that may have had something to do with it, but money for\nthe relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit. I still do that sort of thing. And I had to ask for money and\nsay what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don\u2019t\nyou think we\u2019ve suffered enough, we\u2019ve heard enough? But I think it\u2019s partly guilt. I know now\nthat it\u2019s guilt. And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with\npeople that they couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to do anything or know anything at the time. And they\ncertainly didn\u2019t then. And I found that the hardest thing of all. So I despaired when I came back.\nI despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I\u2019ve ever been in my life, I\nthink. Well, almost.",
        "A: No, I\u2019d been ill, I'd been in hospital. \u2019'd been involved in an accident which I\u2019d had what they\nthought was concussion, I was quite unwell. And I came back on leave and it was decided for\nme, I didn\u2019t decide. I had wanted to go back. In fact, I was dying to go back, I couldn\u2019t wait to go\nback. And I think that partly my despair 1-in this -- in coming back, was due to the fact that I\ncouldn\u2019t go back there, and that I felt more at home there than I did here. And I felt more at ease\nthere, and with myself. And that was very hard for me.",
        "A: I felt more at ease because I knew where I was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and\nwhat I was doing it for. And even if we were failing, or not doing a fantastic job, at least we were\ntrying to do something. Whereas I came back to nothingness, to people who didn\u2019t want to know\nabout it. And that was -- that was awful. So I really found myself in the wilderness when I came\nback. And the fact that it -- that things had changed, new people, new order had been set up out\nthere, Henry was no longer there. It meant that it was difficult for me to go back. And in a way\nthat was quite difficult for me, that whole scene.",
        "A: [hadn\u2019t said my goodbyes to anybody, I hadn\u2019t -- I\u2019d finished the TB train. I mean, that was a\njob, that was a project that lasted many months, and that was the one thing I did achieve,\nwhatever else I did or didn\u2019t achieve, I achieved that. So I felt quite good about the bi -- the -- the\n-- the -- the fact that I\u2019d got a -- managed to get a group of young children and adolescents to\nSwitzerland for treatment of their TB. That was quite an achievement, you know, bearing in\nmind the difficulties that we were faced with. So I felt good about that, but I didn\u2019t feel good\nabout leaving unfinished business, not saying goodbye. I felt very, very bad. It was bad, very\ndifficult for me.",
        "A: Well, there was a period which I really can barely remember, in which I wandered about, as I\nsay, going to the cinema. Sort of not knowing quite what to do. I eventually went to work for the\nJewish Refugee Committee in their emigration department. And then finally, from there, I was\nasked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, working\nwith a group of young children and adolescents who\u2019d been brought to this country whilst I was\nstill in Germany. They came here in 1945. They were young people, orphans who\u2019d been in\nAuschwitz, and been in the slave labor camps. And because of my background I was asked if I\nwould be a caseworker with that organization.",
        "A: I think that had it not been for Henry Lunzer, with his or -- with his sort of military\norganization, in setting up an administration, and an office that actually could operate within\nGerman, and particularly in the British zone, but not only in the British zone, in terms of\nprovision, in terms of negotiation with British military government for the needs of different\nindividuals and groups, I think that we would have achieved very little. I think we -- and I think\nthat his support of the need for children to go to the sanatoria in -- in Switzerland was -- was\ngood, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that. I think\nthat he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small\nresources, and you have a base in another country of purse holders and trustees, who have the\nreputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to\nhave a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there. So there were\ninevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well\nknown, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the\nworld. It\u2019s very difficult to keep those communications clean and good. And it certainly was a\nhandicap in -- in the -- in the Jewish Relief Unit at that time.",
        "A: But I -- I did want to -- but I do -- I do really, at this point, want to pay tribute to Henry\nLunzer because I think that he was a courageous negotiator and was very knowledgeable. He\nknew Germany well, he spoke German well. He could speak to military government. I think, you\nknow, somebody needs to say he did a bloody good job, because he did. Thank you.",
        "A: Once I\u2019d recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the\nworld, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from\nConcentration Camps. I think I mentioned this a little earlier. It was an organization sponsored\nand financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees. And it\u2019s director was a\npracticing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I\u2019d admired very much. Who had been the\ndirector of a type of [indecipherable] institution in Germany, until he himself, as a Jew, was\nexpelled and taken to a concentration camp before the war started, and finally released, and who\ncame to this country, or at least came to Britain as a refugee. And he was, as I say, a practicing\npsychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life,\nand of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in\nthe best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people. I came\nback in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and\nadolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being 1n special homes, out\nof London, where they were helped with language and many different things. By the time I got to\nwork with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some\nkind of future. Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young\npeople, competitive. Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I\nremembered from the camps. Their survival, as -- as had the people in the camps, but let\u2019s just\nmake this kind of -- let\u2019s mark this difference. The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young\npeople I was working with had survived the daily selections for work, or for the gas chamber,\nthrough their ability to maintain strength, to maintain totally focused on their survival, nobody\nelse\u2019s but their survival. Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but\nbasically focused on their own bodily survival. They had to prove their strength, their capacity to\nwork another day. Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival. So\nin dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one\u2019s mind\nthat that was how they survived. And there was never going to be an easy, immediate\ncommunication and trust. There couldn\u2019t be. Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some\ntime. So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of\ncommunication that took into account their need for their own private space. And this 1s quite\nimportant because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke\nabout taking someone\u2019s hand in the camps. What I found with the young people to be very\nimportant was to pi -- allow a space between you and them. A kind of actual, physical space so\nthat -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important\nto maintain that space, but it was. And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of\npower base, their own sense of identity and strength. And I did not invade it.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Yes, yes. And a -- a -- this space was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition. It\nwasn\u2019t something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he\nwas a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had. But I just -- it was something that I just\nsensed as very, very important. Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be\nplaced in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some\nsense of solid -- solidity. However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to,\nso to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced. And I do feel that there was, in\nsome way, a denial of need here. I believe that these young people -- and I\u2019ve said earlier I\nbelieve, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time\nto mourn their dead. And it\u2019s not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the\nsense of their grotesque manner of dying. And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and\nneeds skill. I don\u2019t think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an\nunderstanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture\nof the day, that the idea that -- you see, Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by\nwar, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let\u2019s move forward.\nA new world is born, the war is over, let\u2019s get on with life. That was the message of the day.\nSoldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares. They were\nnot encouraged to talk about the horrors of war. All the war films that came out were really like\nsomething out of Peter Pan, they were so -- so banal, and so sentimental. So sentimental a -- you\nknow, sa -- the war was sentimentalized. It wasn\u2019t portrayed at that stage with all it\u2019s horror. And\nto bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate. Now, I\u2019m not\nsaying that there wasn\u2019t some attention to their inner world. I believe there was some. The Anna\nFreud clinic was involved in some way in observing the young people. But I don\u2019t believe that\nwe dealt with the need to mourn. And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are\nnow, men in their 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation,\nI don\u2019t believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done. It\u2019s easy to say that in\nhindsight. I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social\nterms, flourished, made good, married, had children. But if you observe them, and their\nrelationships, and their long -- I don\u2019t want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very\nsupportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks. So, I mean,\nI went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs. I negotiated yet again\nwith schools, and colleges, and institutions and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes,\nlandlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers. It was a hard time. It had been a hard\nwar, and people were tough, and employers were tough. And the fact that these young people\nwere -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust\nsurvivors, it did not call for compassion. Some were good, some were very good. And many\npeople worked well with the young people, and offered much. And there was a club, and there\nwere facilities and money was sought for special needs. But I would have liked to have dealt\nbetter with some of the strange things that happened. I had a young man, for example, who\u2019d\nbeen -- who had TB. And I went every week to see him here, in a sanatorium near Brentwood.\nHe was a delightful young man from Poland. We spoke together, we talked about his needs. We\ntalked about all kinds of things. But one day when I went there, after many, many months of\ntreatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn\u2019t there. And I was quite upset and I asked the\nnurses what had happened. And they said he just got up and went. Now he -- we don\u2019t know\nwhat happened, and I still to this day don\u2019t know exactly what the process was, whether it was\nlong planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very\nenquiring of me as to why I hadn\u2019t noticed a problem. But such was the defense of this young\nman that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk\nabout quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible\ngirlfriend, all these things we could talk about. But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get\nup and go. So it\u2019s that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis,\nthrough extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide. Where people\nhave built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute\nintimacy and trust. And this is what I think happened with this young man. We ca -- w-we\nmanaged to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a\nfailure.",
        "A: Well, I mean, he succeeded. He got better, he had a girlfriend in the end. No, I don\u2019t think it\nwas a total failure. He was one boy out of many. There was another boy I took, a very, very\nbrilliant boy, who I\u2019ve lat -- just recently found as a professor of chemistry in Canada, in\nuniversity in Canada. I looked for many months, years in fact to find him. He had TB of the\nspine, and I wondered if he\u2019d survived. And I -- I took him before a group of headmasters in a\nspecial school in north London, because he was a very brilliant child, and we had wanted a\nparticular standard of education for him. In coming before the headmasters -- it was a team of\nheadmasters, to judge this young man. I had to, of course, to say that the -- he had lost quite a\nnumber of years of his education. Brilliant as he was, he had lost years. And I explained that he\u2019d\nbeen in this camp, and that camp, slave labor, etcetera, etcetera, Auschwitz. And then the chair of\nthe headmasters turned to me and said, \u201cBut didn\u2019t they give them books to read?\u201d And I was so\naghast. I couldn\u2019t believe it, and I couldn\u2019t find anything to say. Sufficient to say that the young\nman was taken into that particular school. But I\u2019ve never forgotten that, and it\u2019s an indication of\nsociety\u2019s capacity to deny what is taking place. But there was also denial amongst the Jewish\ncommunity when I came back from Germany, as to what had happened to our brethren, to our\nbrothers and sisters. And denial can exist in every population.",
        "A: I think it was partly guilt, that s -- si -- a -- si -- their own survival and other people had not\nsurvived. I -- I shared that. I shared that feeling of -- of having survived when nobody -- you\nknow, when other people did not, and you know, just by the luck of the draw, really. Many of my\nrelatives in Poland indeed had not survived. So -- my father\u2019s relatives. So I think it was partly\nguilt, but it\u2019s also denial. If you deny something, you don\u2019t have to do anything about it. If you\nrecognize something, you have to do something. And you know, I\u2019m faced with this every day,\nin my every day life now. It\u2019s the denial of society to accept that certain people have suffered\nsufficiently to require our attention. And I think that\u2019s what I felt when I came back from\nGermany. It wasn\u2019t just the experience of the camps, of the people, of the ghastliness, of\neverything I\u2019d seen and heard. It was the fact that when I came back I couldn\u2019t get anybody to\neven unders -- want to -- want to understand what had happened. And so this really is my -- my\nmost urgent plea. It\u2019s not only about remembering the past, it\u2019s about preserving the future. And\nwe can only preserve the future if we recognize what we are doing to each other, and what that\nmeans for the victims, and what we need to do if we\u2019re to be a compassionate society.",
        "A: Oh, I thought that was the fi --",
        "A: I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors. Of\ncourse, there were girls, we always called them the boys, but there were girls. And I continue to\nstay in touch with them. When I say I continue to work with them, the work finished probably\nafter a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to\nwork with them for a number of years after that. And I still see them, particularly one or two of\nthem. But I then went on to do some hospital jobs, social work jobs in hospitals. I joined\nAmnesty in 1961. And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know\nit\u2019s not relevant, except to do with hatred. It was very easy to hate one particular nation, and one\nparticular group of people. And I\u2019d enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for\nmany years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen\nhis family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was\nbeaten to death in the house in which they were on the Kristallnacht. So living with his\ndepression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in Majdanek\nconcentration camp, I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years. But it was\nwhen I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many\ncountries in the world. That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were\ntorturing. That you could not put -- you could not put a frontier up and say this is where it begins,\nand this is where it ends. And I\u2019m not making, and I\u2019m not comparing one genocide, or one cat --\ncatastrophe with another. The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the\n20\" century. But I still feel that we mustn\u2019t close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as\nwe\u2019 ve seen recently, for example, in Rwanda. So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the\nspirits, you know, with the idea that I can\u2019t nurse this forever. I have to accept and have to\nunderstand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to\nunderstand it better. My work in Amnesty went on for many years. I -- I helped to form the first\nmedical group in the British section of Amnesty International, taking testimony and documenting\nevidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who\u2019d come to this\ncountry, and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty. And it was coming out of that -- that\nwork, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply\nevidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human\nrights, including the United Nations, but that we weren\u2019t actually treating the survivors. That\nmade me feel we weren\u2019t really fulfilling our task. And as people were beginning to ask us to\ntake care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different countries who\nlook -- resided 1n this country, and who\u2019d been tortured and violated in many different ways, and\nlost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on.\nWe established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of\ntorture at the end of 1985. And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto. And the\nvision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims. In other words, to take heed of\npeople\u2019s protection, their human rights, to be part of that. If necessary even to be advocates for\nthat, which is not easy for therapists. But also to look at the medical, psychological and social\nneeds of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation. We\u2019ve treated over 35,000\npeople, from over 91 different countries, and I have to tell you that my room every day, my\nconsulting room every day, is filled with horrendous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation,\nof hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from all over the world. And I suppose really, that is the\nbeginning and end, in some ways of my story. I\u2019m doing what I set out to do. I know I can\u2019t save\neverybody. I know that my own skills are limited. We\u2019re an organization with no -- insufficient\nresources to meet the needs of everyone. I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at\nleast our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30\u2019s. People are not welcomed, people are deported\nback to the countries which tortured them. European countries are closing the doors, we have a\nfortress Europe. We don\u2019t look for good solutions. We didn\u2019t in the 30\u2019s and we don\u2019t now. So\nreally, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual\u2019s\nfamily. And that can be very rewarding work, even if it can also be quite distressing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I would have established the Medical Foundation, and worked so long in the\nMedical Foundation if I hadn\u2019t been to Belsen. What I learned in Belsen was about a kind of\nsuffering that we have never really begun to understand, about loss, about grotesque death, about\nthe need to mourn. About -- about despair and the desire to die. I learned all of these things in\nBelsen, but I also learned about the resilience, and something about the human spirit and\npeople\u2019s capacity to survive, and people\u2019s capacity to overcome, if you are able to resource\nsomething within them. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. I didn\u2019t understand how to resource it for\nmany years. But with time, you are able to resource people\u2019s skills, people\u2019s -- you are able to\nretrieve something of who that person was. And that\u2019s very, very important. You are able to deal,\nor to try to come to terms with grotesque death. To find ways of burying the dead that are very\nunusual. And this we\u2019ve had to do in the Medical Foundation. It\u2019s about an holistic approach to\ntrauma, and to loss, using medicine, using psychology, but also using very adaptive measures.\nYou can\u2019t deal -- you know, you can\u2019t bring a very traditional form of therapy very often to\npeople from different -- from certain dif -- from different cultures, from different beliefs in\nhealing. You\u2019ll have to listen to what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative\nways of working with people, and I can give many examples of that, but I don\u2019t think that that is\nthe purpose of this discussion. I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address\ngovernment, it\u2019s home office. It doesn\u2019t always succeed, but it tries. It\u2019s learned skills of\nnegotiation and understanding other people\u2019s difficulties. But how you hold the vision, and how\nyou deal with continuing -- a continuing lack of compassion and understanding, both in the\npublic -- or some of the public, not all of the public, we have quite a following, but in some of\nthe public, and in some of government, is very difficult to do.",
        "A: [ll tell you some of it, because it would take a lifetime to discuss it properly. I went to Israel\nto take part with a colleague of mine who is formerly -- was -- was born in Israel, but lives in this\ncountry and works as a psychologist. I went to attend a conference of the Israeli and Palestinian\nPhysicians for Human Rights. The Medical Foundation does link to various human rights\norganizations. And because of my background, and because of the background of my colleague,\nit seemed very appropriate that we should link to something that sounded as constructive as an\nIsraeli and Palestinian Formation for the Benefit of Human Rights. We knew, and had met the\nIsraeli members of the organization, and the Palestinians. I had known and worked with for\nmany years -- that means to say, when I say worked with, I mean I\u2019ve communicated with a very\nprofound child psychiatrist from Gaza who studied in this country, and is working with the Gaza\ncommunity mental health team in Gaza. So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the\nconference, which regrettably was on the subject of torture. Torture worldwide, torture\nthroughout the world, but torture also in Israel. And when I was there, I was asked by the\nPhysicians for Human Rights if I would help them in the case of a Palestinian where it had\nbecome obvious from the papers that had been found of his interrogation, that he had been\ntortured in order -- in order for him to confess, whether I will be prepared to help them. And I\nmet the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in his case before I made any decisions. And I was\nvery impressed with his integrity, and his dignity, and his desire as an Israeli to provide fairness\nand justice where he felt 1t was appropriate. On reading the document, it was obvious to me that\ncertain forms of what we would call torture had taken place. And I agreed, reluctantly may I say,\nto, as a visiting director of an organization concerned with torture, to take part in a certain aspect\nof his trial. It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the\nlawyers request that I acquiesced to this. And I produced a document, and I attended the court.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: And so we went -- I went with the -- with the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer, and my colleague\nwho had come with me and escorted me from the UK, to Hebrum. It was extremely hot. And we\nhad to wait for many hours because the judge was not happy about my giving any evidence in the\ncourt. And I think that she, quite understandably, had to take advice from other authorities before\nshe could proceed, and she went on really for many hours before eventually, I was allowed to\ncome into the court, and to give only very restricted information. I could not refer to certain\naspects which they considered I was not qualified to refer to. So, my role was rather a limited\none. But I could talk about confessions under torture, and that confessions under torture can\nnever be reliable ones, for quite obvious reasons. That people will often say something in\nextreme discomfort that isn\u2019t necessarily true. And as torture is universally outlawed, it does\nseem rather inappropriate for any court to take, to accept a confession that actually took place\nunder coercion, and under extreme pressure. Before I went to the court, I sat for some time in a\nvery small, hot flat, without air conditioning, to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick,\nsmelly, kind of wooly, wool material, army material hood. I didn\u2019t have such an exact hood, but I\nhad sufficient to give me a feeling of how claustrophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would\nbe. I wasn\u2019t able to adopt the position that 1s adopted, that was adopted, and is -- is often used in\nsuch cases in Israel, where somebody is placed on a low chair, their hands tied behind them, and\nthe chair\u2019s feet are shorter in the front than the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and\nexposed to quite a lot of noise, loud noise, and you are also in this very uncomfortable position,\nsitting on this seat, which has a traditional name, which I shall remember soon, I think if\nanybody were to try that position, they would find it extremely uncomfortable, because the\nweight of the body is distributed in such a way that there\u2019s enormous pressure on the back, and\none is in extreme discomfort and fear, and exposed to noise. Man also had an injury that had\nbeen recorded in the notes, but which I was not allowed to refer to in the court, which was an\ninjury to his nose, which the doctor had recorded. Now, I -- it\u2019s difficult for me to discuss this\nparticular case. It so happens that the case was resolved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an\nexpert in confessions under pers -- under duress, came from the Mordsley hospital as an\nindependent expert, and gave evidence in this case.",
        "A: Yes, a British hospital. Because, as they professed to be uns -- not satisfied with my\ncredentials as an expert witness, I did suggest to the court, that if they were concerned, as they\nsaid they were, to ascertain whether the man had confessed under torture, then perhaps the best\nway of doing it was to get somebody whose expertise could not be denied. And so this was\nagreed, and eventually an expert, as I say, from a renowned institution, and whose seminal work\nis in confessions obtained under duress [indecipherable] attend the court. And the man\u2019s sentence\nwas commuted. Is 1 -- 1s that the word? From I think 15 years, which was his convicted -- was the\n-- was what he was convicted -- was what he was given on conviction. But I think it -- he w --\ndid -- it was then --",
        "A: Reduced to a very short period, and he was released quite soon. It was a very, very difficult\nexperience for me. For me, with my background, to stand in Israeli court, defending a\nPalestinian, who was there, and who looked extremely fearful, and obviously with a -- some --\nwell, was very hard. But it was much harder to do nothing. If had done nothing, I could never\nreally have lived with my principles, which is that nobody, under any circumstances should be\nsignaled out for torture, and that there are other ways. If you do want information, you have to\nfind, with all the ingenuity that exists within societies, other ways. But you do not torture, you do\nnot torture. Torture is such an abominable, devastating experience, both to those who practice it,\nI believe, in the end, and those on who it 1s inflicted. It is really the most terrible memory that la -\n- that -- that man can have. And the nightmares, and the physical pain, the sense of one\u2019s own\nbetrayal -- the body betrays in torture. The body gives out, and the body betrays you in torture.\nAnd for a civilized country, for civilized people to be practicing torture on an individual is\nunforgivable, and cannot be condoned under any circumstances. And I know there\u2019s a great\ndiscussion going on about -- at the moment about whether torture is justified, and others must\nindulge in that. But my views are clear, and my experience of working with survivors 1s that they\n-- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, just as it is with Holocaust survivors to\novercome the effects of torture. And for -- to employ people to torture as your agents is, I think\nthe s -- beginning of a very slippery slope. If you employ people to torture, or to apply as they\nsay, minimum pressure, or whatever the phrase is. It doesn\u2019t matter what the phrase is. What it\nmeans is to frighten through physical and psychological pain into a confession. It\u2019s no way to\nbehave for a civilized society. And there are people in Israel who feel very, very unhappy, very\nuncomfortable about what is going on. And torture does exist, I\u2019m afraid, in -- in Israel. And I\nhave been witness to a number of testimonies of people who\u2019ve been tortured. And it\u2019s an\nunbearable thought, but I think that we have to -- I take heart from the fact that there are people\nin Israel who are working very, very hard to find a way to end this, and who\u2019ve spoken out very\ncourageously. I wish there were more. I know that there\u2019s a great deal of fear, but I don\u2019t with to\nget into the political scene in Israel. People have elected their representatives, and they have\nmade a decision. I with there was not so much hatred against the Palestinians. And I wish the\nPalestinians would not do what they are doing. I\u2019ve worked with moderate, and intelligent, and\ncaring Palestinians and Israelis who come together and want to bring about change, and it\u2019s our\njob to help them do that. Not to be defensive about what is going on there, but rather to look for a\nsolution, I think, as to how we as individuals can assist people to bring about change in their\nsocieties. It is about the way people lose it, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s extraordinary, I -- I would question that. But I -- I think really, my\nconcern, what -- what worries me most is lack of compassion. I think it\u2019s so easy to turn against\npeople, to create scapegoats. I mean, no -- no nation, no group of people can be more conscious\nof that than the Jewish people, how easy it is for them to be scapegoated. They always have\nbeen, and they\u2019re still being scapegoated. But we have to be careful about this, and we have to be\ninforming all the time, people about the need to understand other people, to be compassionate.\nWe\u2019re not a compassionate society here or anywhere else that I can see. And we can do so many\nthings. We\u2019re now going off to Mars, and to the moon, and here and there, but we don\u2019t know\nhow to maintain compassion. What I saw happen in Belsen was the dying of compassion. There\nwas outrage and compassion when the camp was liberated, but I watched it die. I watched it not\nthere when I came back. And when I speak today to people -- I watched it in hospitals where\nchildren, in my view, were really abused, and restrained, when they should not have been. I don\u2019t\nmean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, really. Stupidly treated. I just -- I just -- I\nmean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees came to this country -- we can question why, but\npeople came to the airports with teddy bears and presents, and there was all kinds of support and\ninterest in their welfare, particularly families with small children. People were able to identify\nthem. But even though they were able to identify them, the compassion is gone. If I say today\nthat my own government is considering sending back a Kosovan family, who we feel, for\nreasons of torture and rape and various other situations, really should not go back, but should be\nallowed to stay, there won\u2019t be that compassion. The compassion has died. And so I don\u2019t know\nwhat maintains compassion. And I don\u2019t know how to help people or to instill compassion in\npeople when they\u2019ve lost it. And I think that is really the predicament for s -- f -- f -- and always\nhas been. It\u2019s about being compassionate to the people who are so different from you. And even\npeople you may not like very much. I mean, I don\u2019t like all my clients, I don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s not\nmy job. I remember when I was in Germany and I said on one occasion to a much more\nexperienced colleague, my God, I\u2019m so tired of -- there\u2019s one particular person that drove me\nliterally -- drove me quite mad, and was very demanding. And he said, \u201cLook, you\u2019re not here to\nlike people. You\u2019re not here to like them.\u201d And that\u2019s quite true. I\u2019m not doing this work because\nI like everybody. And I don\u2019t expect to, and it would be foolish for me to do so. But there has to\nbe a degree of compassion if we\u2019re to deal with the ills of society. I don\u2019t know. I [inaudible]. I\ncan\u2019t finish it. \u2019 ve come to the end. I don\u2019t know, it sounds like a sermon from God knows\nwhere. I don\u2019t intend it to sound like a sermon. It\u2019s not like that, but \u2019 ve watched compassion\ndie so quickly, I just -- it\u2019s just a plea for some kind of understanding that isn\u2019t there.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
