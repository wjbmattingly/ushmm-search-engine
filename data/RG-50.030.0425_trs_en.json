        "Q: Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after\nKristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to Hamburg and stayed with your sister for about a\nweek, who was living there. What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the\nrest of your family was and did you have any contact with them?",
        "A: My family was, my whole family was in Hamburg. My brother who had run away from Bremen\nhad also come to Hamburg. My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in\nHamburg, so they were all in Hamburg.",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "A: My father was also in Hamburg. After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I\nreturned to Bremen and we were living in the same house where we had lived before. We were\nsearching the house and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything\nupside-down, we put the whole house in order and we were living there and repairing as much as\npossible. In addition we tried to emigrate and find a place where to emigrate.",
        "Q: And what were the results of that effort?",
        "A: We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we\nhave no place, we like to help you, but we can't. Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November\nninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my\nmother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), Saskatchewan, if he\ncould do anything about it. This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of\nParliament in Canada and find how to get us special permission. And he would then send us what is\ncalled a landing card, that we were allowed to land. After a few weeks, we got this landing card.\nNow the question was to leave Germany. You needed first of all, permission from the German\ngovernment and they would be there when we would pack our things. But first of all we had to get\ntickets to go to Canada. My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which 1s a shipping company in\nGermany, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they\nwere all booked up for two years. We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to\nHamburg again and Hamburg had that, Hamburg had a connection with British Airline, with the\nBritish, not airline, with the British shipping line, the Koolnot(ph) Whitestar(ph) line and he met a\nman from there and he said he would get us passage to Canada. However, to get there, we needed\nfirst to go by ferry boat, from Hamburg to England and from England to Southampton, we would\ntake a boat to Canada. When the landing cart came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he\narranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to Canada. We were traveling five\npeople, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. But we needed money for the tickets. In\norder to do this, we had to sell our house. Now there was one woman, \u2014_ woman, who the Nazi's\nhad planted into our house, she wanted to buy it. Of course she bought it with very little money,\njust enough money to pay for the tickets. So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact\nthe date was set by the shipping company, for May 31, 1939. On that day we would leave Germany\nwith the ferry boat. Many other things happened between December and May, 1939. For instance,\none thing which happened was in January, 1939. On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's\nbirthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family\nGreenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which said, \"Come to Berlin.\" I didn't\nknow originally from whom it came, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a\nJewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to Berlin and go to\nthis organization. He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, \"Go there\nright away.\" So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the train station and the next train was\ngoing at 12 at night, so I took that night train. But 1t was a very uncomfortable trip because there\nwere the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I\nwalked around the train. It was what we call a express train, where there is a hallway at the side and\nthen there are cabins in there. So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in Berlin, 1t wasn't\nmy first time in Berlin. It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk. I came to\nthe Brandenberger(ph) gate, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a\nsign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very\nquickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization,\nI came to the fourth floor and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we\nare waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of\ncourse, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to Lithuania, Estonia and\nLatvia, to the Baltic states and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation\nfor emigration to Israel. Then they would recognize us and they would go there. So the whole day\nwe were typing out, with the type machine, of course they had no electric typing machines at that\ntime, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission,\nthey were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in Latvia, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave\nthem to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from concentration camp and they came out.\nHowever, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered\nEstonia and Latvia and Lithuania and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them\nmight have. So that was in January.",
        "Q: Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described. First of all, were you\nat this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands?",
        "A: No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star.",
        "Q: And in terms of this operation in Berlin, what was this organization?",
        "A: It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) Israel and they were trying, like everyone else,\ntrying to get Jews out. Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would\naccept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake,\nbecause especially the South American countries, Latin American countries were working very\nmuch with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American\ndiplomats very many times and they said to me, \"Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will\nlet you out.\" So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that company, to that country and they were all\nworking together. Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people\nwent out and they were not permitted in that country because they said we don't, these are illegal\ncertificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many countries. But the Nazi's\nwere very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see,\neither by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they\nmeasured them all.",
        "Q: This organization that you were working with in Berlin, was this in place for years, was this an\noutgrowth of political organizations you were involved with?",
        "A: No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually. They were more or less a Jewish __\u2014__\u2014s more,\nI would say more religious kind of organization than another kind of organization. But all\norganizations tried somehow to bring their members or to bring Jews out, because I can tell you,\nlater on when I, all right, that comes later.",
        "Q: Were you, my question is, were you affiliated with this organization or similar organizations,\nyears before?",
        "A: Yes. I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934. They had such an\norganization in Bremen, where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist\norganization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious\nreasons and then there was a special teacher in Bremen, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he\nwas from this organization, from Agoutis(ph) Israel and I joined him. So I was already affiliated\nwith this organization.",
        "Q: And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization?",
        "A: The focus was to work for the Jews to go to Israel, mainly at that time, you see and also\nreligiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more\nreligious instead of assimilation. It was a question of assimilation. It was a question of\nassimilation, emancipation. That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of\nuniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves.",
        "Q: And you felt that was important?",
        "A: Yes. Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the school\ndays, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to school any more on\nShabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation\nmarks, more German.",
        "Q: And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's?",
        "A: No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came\nfrom a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish",
        "Q: Back to Agoutis(ph) in Berlin, was there any risk to what you were doing or was this basically\nauthorized?",
        "A: It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done,\nbecause the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had\nthe final solution, you see and they didn't want them to __1n there, they said, \"The world does not\ntake them, the world does not want them.\" As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another\ncountry was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these\npeople go and go there.",
        "Q: When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them?",
        "A: They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my\norganization in Bremen at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has\nnames, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave\nthem different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see. So\nthat's how they were choosing them.",
        "Q: So you helped whoever you could?",
        "A: Whoever, yeah, _..",
        "Q: And how did you know that somebody was in Sachsenhausen or somebody was in Dachau, or\nwherever?",
        "A: These people sometimes wrote. If they were in Sachsenhausen, it say Sachsenhausen, near\nBerlin. Or Dachau near Munich. They wrote and at that time, we knew where the people were,\nbesides this, as I can tell you later, I had some contact with the Gestapo and they told me that, \"We\nhave people here in Sachsenhausen,\" and so forth and forth.",
        "Q: How long did you work with Agoutis(ph) in Berlin?",
        "A: I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on\nthis one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them\ngo, most of them. And then I went back to Bremen. I was still in contact with them afterwards, but\nthis was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that\nday and made it all final, in one day.",
        "Q: Busy day.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you went back to Bremen?",
        "A: I went back to Bremen. Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at\nnighttime that they may knock at the door and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also\nin January one day they came, an ominous knock at the door 1n the middle of the night. My brother\nwho were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in Hamburg and they had sent him to the\nJewish hospital in Hamburg. First he was in Sachsenhausen and from Sachsenhausen, somehow,\nthey arranged with the Hamburg, I don't know who, how, but he was in the Jewish hospital in\nHamburg. So one night, they knocked at the door and I looked out of the window and I made\nmyself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, \"What can I lose?\" I go downstairs, I\nopen up. I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went downstairs, I opened up and he came in, not in\nNazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant\nfor your brother, Benu(ph), his name. I said to them, \"Don't you know that he is in the hospital in\nHamburg?\" He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through. They came\nthrough, they put upside-down the beds and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said,\n\"You should have known that he is in Hamburg in the hospital.\" He said, \"Yeah, excuse me\" and\nthey left. But they came in and they made a person scared, you know. They could always come in,\nmiddle of the night and knock at the door. I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a\nbicycle, we had a bicycle, to the synagogue, which was about, by bicycle, 15 minutes away, 20\nminutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind. So this was 1939, in January. In\nFebruary, the congregation in Bremen, the Jewish congregation in Bremen, organized itself again\nand they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no place any more to live, so\nthere was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a\nbrother of this Greenberg and they had a house in Bremen and they had already left this house in\nSeptember 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the Bremen\ncongregation. I met him later on in New York. But this was a house in the old city and there were\nmaybe 20 families living in this house now, besides that's the office of the congregation, was also in\nthis house and we organized it. So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things.\nNumber one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I\nknew a little bit of English, not too much. Number two, we organized some courses for women in\nsewing and other things like this. Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in\nWeisaminda(ph), which is near Bremerhaven(ph), that wanted some people to come and talk to\nthem, so I went there sometimes and talked to them. Number four, we wanted to make a Jewish\nschool again because the children did not go to school. I can speak about this later. And, besides\nthis, number five, they wanted a person from the Jewish community to be acontact _, going to\nthe Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe three times a week and tell them about what was\nhappening in the congregation, so I was elected, appointed. So I went there many times.",
        "Q: Were you and your father living in this Jewish house, community house now?",
        "A: No, we did not live in this Jewish community house, we lived in our own house, but many\npeople had no house any more, especially people from the small communities outside, you see.\nMany people in Germany, most people, most Jews in Germany, did not live in the big cities, they\nlived in small hamlets, how do you call it, villages and they came then to the bigger cities to be\nsafer. So they appointed me and I went to the Gestapo and I never knew whether I would come out\nbecause __\u2014_\u2014sdGGestapo was a big building which had no sign outside. You didn't know that it was\na Gestapo building. It was in a section of Bremen, they had and Bremen was a medieval city and it\nhad a trench around it and around the trench was a street which was called Amvahl(ph), it means\n______ in the war, there used to be war in medieval Germany, the cities had a wall around it and\nwhen I came there I had to push a button on top and the door would open and I would go in. And\nwhen I went in, there was a big picture, a man with two fingers on his lips that said silence,\nschweigne(ph), quiet. And then someone would tell me, \"Come upstairs.\" I didn't know who it\nwas, but I went upstairs. So I went upstairs, I went into this office and it was all clattered around\nwith all kinds of things and this man was sitting there and his name was Mr. Parchman, I still\nremember that P-a-r-c-h-m-a-n and he was nobody, an illiterate person \u2014.:~And he said to me,\n\"Sit down.\" Of course they address the Jews as Uder(ph) in German and they were very, very rude.\nSit down. Then he took out and I remember the first time I came, he took out a bunch of pictures\nand papers and he said to me, \"These are the pictures and papers which we rescued from your\nhouse.\" Rescued, you know. Was not rescued, they confiscated it. I said, \"Can I have them?\" So\nhe gave me a little bit, not everything.",
        "Q: Why were they so nice?",
        "A: They did not want to be complete, you see, every person, even the worst person in the world,\nsometimes has a soft moment. So he also had a soft moment at one time. He gave me a little bit,\nbut what I asked him then, most of the time when I went to him, I asked him, \"Can you get this\nperson and this person,\" I've got a few names of people from the Jewish congregation who were in\nconcentration camp, \"I want this person to get out, can you get him out, will you let him out?\" And\nthat was the main purpose in the first part of my contacts with them, to save people, to let them out\nof concentration camps. Sometimes he let them out, but not very many times, he said, \"What's he\ngoing to do, where's he going to go,\" so forth. The second part of my contact with the Gestapo was\nto have permission to make a Jewish school, because the children didn't have any more school, they\nwere forbidden to go in German school, even in Jewish school, no schools. So what do we want to\nteach them in the schools? I want to teach them how to leave Germany as quick as possible,\nbecause that's what you want. So what would he teach them? I will teach them English and\ngeography and certain things which they might be able to use after the emigrate and also I will\nteach, I will give them a little bit of exercise, gymnastics or so, you see they have to be strong when\nthey leave. So they went on, they said, \"We have no place for German children and besides,\" says,\n\"when do you want to teach the children?\" In the morning you are not allowed to teach them, he\ntold me, because then German children are being taught and German children cannot be taught at\nthe same time when Jewish children are being taught and the other way around. So I, I negotiated\nwith him for a long time and he didn't want to give us a Jewish school or a place, then I said to him,\n\"What about a place,\" and I found a place, \"near, near that hotel there, no one is there, it's not a\nschool building, but 1t could be used as a school building and we can use it in the afternoon.\"\n\"When do you want to teach the children, what time? Because the German children go to school\nuntil three-thirty in the afternoon, you can only teach them from four until about six or six-thirty.\" I\nsaid, \"Okay.\" So finally he agreed and we had this place to take the Jewish children. Now I made a\nlist of Jewish children, we had about 40 Jewish children at that time, boys and girls in all ages, up to\n15 or 16 years of age and some of them came from small villages outside. But the question was\nteachers, we had no teachers. So I knew some merchants, you see and I said to them, you teach him\nthis, you teach him this and I'll tell you what to do. So we, we had a few teachers, you see and they\nwere not trained teachers, but I said the school should not be like a very slow, a very low elementary\nschool, but more like a middle school or so, like a little bit higher school and that's what it was. So\nthe school opened on April 12th, 1939. We left Germany in May 1939, end of May, May 31, 1939,\nso I was there just two months, but during that time, I hired a teacher, one of my, one of my\ncolleagues from \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s Seminary, where he was, had learned to be a teacher and he became my\nsuccessor and the school stayed until about 1941, I think, when all the Jews were in Bremen, were\nsent to Minsk and Pinsk, in concentration camps.",
        "Q: Couple questions, I guess about school first. You said there were about how many students who\nwere able to?",
        "A: 42.",
        "Q: And were they all ages?",
        "A: All ages.",
        "Q: Anybody who could, come?",
        "A: Anybody who could come.",
        "Q: Do you think that that school was helpful in terms of morale, in terms of education?",
        "A: Yes, it was very helpful I think, because the parents, I mean when we had our first meeting and I\ngave them the introductory talk about what the school was going to be and what we would be\nteaching and so the parents also came and it was very helpful and in fact, I met two of my students\nfrom that time in New York later on. In fact, one of my, one of, no, at least two students who I met\nin New York, they are now married, you know and their husbands came to my classes here, which I\ngave here in America. So, it was helpful, I think.\n[end of side one, tape one]",
        "Q: I want to ask you a few questions about the Jewish community house. Do you think that\neverybody living together served a purpose other than just a place to live?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, it was safer, they felt safer being together, you see, being among friends, being\namong people of their own kind, I mean, that already makes them feel safer. And besides this, if\nthey had any problems, they had right away in that house, people whom they could ask and turn to,\nbecause these, and these, their Jewish community you see, had contacts with getting food, getting\nother things and so forth.",
        "Q: Did the Germans periodically come to the house, visit the house?",
        "A: They knew about it. I don't remember any more, if they came, because I wasn't living there, you\nsee.",
        "Q: Did people get around much or did they largely stay at home?",
        "A: No, at that time it was still possible to walk around, to go places, it was possible. The first time\nthat actually, I mean that was long time ago, if they remember the first boycott, which was 1933\n____, but at that time, you could go, you could walk around, of course you had to be careful and\nthe Nazis were not all, Nazis, you see. There were also some Germans who still thought, it will pass\nover.",
        "Q: But when you walked on the streets, wasn't there a certain element of fear, a certain element of\nrisk?",
        "A: Yes, you felt things might come, as I mentioned before, especially during the night. The Nazis\nwere using what is called two things. They were using deception and dehumanization. That means\nthey were deceiving people and make believe it was not so, it's not bad, you can do what you want,\nyou see, so people went around, but they were never safe if something would happen to them. So\nthey were careful and they walked around usually, not by themself, but with a friend, with others.",
        "Q: Did people get beat up or anything? Or just grabbed and taken somewhere?",
        "A: That happened usually during the night when no one saw it, because Nazis did not want to do\nanything during daytime, actually. That's why all the time, they were still a little bit reluctant to do\nthings so openly, because they didn't want the world, the press to know about that, that they do do it\nopenly. They wanted the world to know and to fear that whatever they did is by law. Therefore\nthey made a law, Jews cannot go to school any more. They made a law, lawyers cannot have\npractice in here any more and things like this, they wanted to do everything by law.",
        "Q: Now, to your knowledge, the people who were living in this community house, did they have\nplans, were the plans to try to emigrate, what did they thing was going to happen?",
        "A: At that time, after Krystallnacht, the whole world saw and the Jews also knew, even those Jews\nwho still loved Germany and they lived in Germany for a long time and they had family trees and\nthey had ancestors, they saw that you cannot live in Germany any more. So everyone from that\nmoment on, worked on emigration, to find out the place where to go, because they knew there was\nno, that's why I called my school the Dead End school, it was only toward an end, because we knew\nwe wouldn't exist forever. There would come a time, you see, when we would have to close and we\ndid close afterwards.",
        "Q: One more question about that house, because I'm just trying to get a sense of what the daily life\nwas like at this period in Germany. Did they, there was a school, people had to make arrangements\nfor religious activities or for getting food, or was there any culture or cultural activities, anything\nlike this?",
        "A: Well, they had ___ services, religious services in this building, they had some classes, you see,\nI also gave some classes as I said before, for translation for English and so forth and __.\nHowever, the community in Bremen consists actually of two types of Jews, there's one type of Jews\nwhich were the German Jews who were born in Germany and who lived there a long time. Then\nthere were, was a little community, a little bit away from Bremen of Eastern Jews. They call it in\nGerman _, who came from eastern. I was very friendly with them, you see, because I went\nthere many times. They had their own community. But they had all their culture alive, because\nwhen they stay together, you see, they either were learning a few subjects or they were preparing for\nemigration, they were taking your job, they were learning a language, they were learning something\nelse.",
        "Q: Okay, your work with the Gestapo. Initially you said when you went in, there was someone who\ntook you up to Mr. Parchman. Were there always the same people there that you dealt with, or were\nthere different officers there all the time?",
        "A: They were all different, but I had this particular person, Mr. Parchman. I always saw him, most\nof the ttme. He was__sinchargeofthe Jews _ problem. He was in charge and so I had to see\nhim because he was the one appointed by the Nazis to have the contact with us. So I always saw the\nsame person.",
        "Q: How would you describe your relationship with him?",
        "A: I never knew what he would say. I never knew what he would say, but I never knew whether,\nwhether he would let me go out again. I never knew what kind of questions he would ask me. But I\ntold him all the time, as I mentioned before, I was working on two, in two areas with him, first of all\nto get Jews out of concentration camps, number two to have a school. And that was my main\nrelationship with him and he was sitting there with his feet on the table and, and trying to degrade\nme, __ sit down and things like this, but I did not really play, play a game with him to say that I\nwould do everything what he wanted me to do or so, but, but you have to know what, about what\nyou want to say and you have to feel what, how he would react. I never knew how he would react,\nbut I just was normal, normally, normal. I don't know if is this what you mean.",
        "Q: Well, I'm trying to get a sense of how you, instinctively knew how to handle yourself, whether\nhe was particularly abusive and in what way and how you responded to it.",
        "A: I tried not to make him feel embarrassed or attack the Nazi system. I just talked from my point\nof view, that means when my point of view, the point of view of the Jews you see, that we are here\nnow and I know that you don't want us here and we want to leave and that was always my basic\nphilosophy, my basic philosophy was let the Jews out of the concentration camps, so that they can\nleave Germany, let us make a school, so that we can prepare them for emigration. It was always,\nmy philosophy was always to get out of Germany and that's really what he wanted, so I actually\nplayed on his wavelengths.",
        "Q: That was smart. Was he ever physically abusive?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Just verbally?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Now were you able, did you have access to special information because of this position or job,\nthat you were able to then take back to the Jewish community?",
        "A: Yes, for instance, sometimes he would tell me, we let these people out in three days, or this\nperson is now in the concentration camp. He would give me some names sometimes, but most of\nthe time he didn't want to give information, he wanted information from me. He wanted\ninformation, you see, what are the Jews doing there? I mean, do they have money, do they emigrate\nand things, well how far are they, do we have services, what do you do? He wanted from me, but I\ngot something from him too.",
        "Q: Did you tell him whatever he wanted to know?",
        "A: I sometimes told him and sometimes not. For instance, he asked me, from where are these? And\nhe showed me all the things which he had taken out of our house __\u2014.:~XHe asked me, \"Do you\nknow this, do you know this?\" So I said to him, \"You know better than I do, because you took it\nout. So where did you find it, what did you do with it.\" No, I never, no.",
        "Q: Were there any other Jewish people who would go to the headquarters or just you?",
        "A: I would go there regularly, I don't think anyone else would go. He would sometimes come, I\ndon't even know if he would come to the president, I know Mr. Ostrich(ph), I think his name was, I\ndon't remember his name. If he wanted something, he, but I was the one who would go there, I\nthink I was the only one who would go there.",
        "Q: One other question, you said you never really knew what was going to happen when you went\nthere, were you ever really caught off guard? Were there some close calls and big surprises, good\nor bad?",
        "A: I don't remember anything of this sort. No, he always considered himself a nice guy, quotation\nmark, by letting me go again and when I asked for instance, my brother should come out of the\nconcentration camp, I mean, he let him out of the concentration camp. I don't know now, it's too\nlong ago, whether it was, probably a both combination of him and the Jewish hospital in Hamburg,\nsomehow a combination, I don't know how they worked together and he came out. But I never had\na clash with him in that way that he surprised me with something or not. He surprised me the very\nfirst time, that he had all the things, I was surprised that he had all these things which he had taken\nout of our house.",
        "Q: Now, you were at this point, I'm trying to figure out, how old you were, about early 20's?",
        "A: Yeah. 21.",
        "Q: 21, you were taking on a lot of responsibility, it sounds like you had guts and good instincts.\nWhat do you think prepared you for this?",
        "A: Ihave a philosophy you see, if possible to make a compromise and I had to make a compromise,\nin school for instance, when I went to the Nazi school. And besides this I made a compromise when\nI went with the Zionist youth club and, and when I went to Frankfurt, I studied at the sin\nFrankfurt and then afterwards I went to Wurzburg and I tried to bring people closer and make them\naccept it and so forth all the time, so I think I had this kind of thing, even I talked to the Nazi\nteachers in school, I always tried to compromise in a certain way, but not give up my principles,\nbecause when the teachers told me that you cannot go to school any more, I mentioned this already\nbefore and I just said to him, \"We are on the same wavelength, you be a Nazi and I be a Jew.\" So\nyou go your way and learn more about Germany and I am a Jew and I want to learn more about\nbeing a Jew.",
        "Q: Do you think that you got any of this common sense from your family or you just learned it on\nyour own in the way you were brought up?",
        "A: Part of it, of course, I got from my family, especially my mother. She came from Hamburg and\nshe was always welcomed and she was always recognized and tried to make people friendly and in\nour business you see, when people came to our business buying and selling, for repairs and so forth,\nshe did favors for all these people. She wrote letters for them. At that time, we didn't have\ntypewriters, so people wrote longhand, she had a very good handwriting, so she wrote letters for\nthem. And my father, who came from Russia, also and then of course myself, because since I went\nto a non-Jewish school, I had to do, excuse me, since I went to a non-Jewish school, I had to be able\nto live together with them and to talk to them you see, not only about myself, but also about them\nand so forth. So I had a lot of friends and even had so many friends in my class that even after |\ncameto __, they wanted to make me class president, but I didn't want to.",
        "Q: So you worked with the Gestapo and the Jewish community until you were able to emigrate?",
        "A: Not through them. The reason they, as I started to tell you before, we wrote to all people and we\ngot the landing cards from my cousin, from my father's cousin and then my father arranged for us to\nemigrate, so it really came from the outside, it didn't come from the Nazis.",
        "Q: Right, but you worked as a liaison with them until the time when you left?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you feel you want to say about that period in Germany before we talk\nabout your emigrating?",
        "A: Yes, there is one thing, we started the school on April 12th, 1939 and I went there every day, I\ndon't, I think we only were allowed to be in the school two or three times a week and then when we\nhad to give up the whole house, our whole house, so I was there when we packed, we packed the\nvan and the man was standing there. Some people tried to slip in certain things, but I was afraid to\nput in anything else. I wanted to put in some newspapers from Germany, where they spoke about\nthe Nazis, one paper I put in, about there was a law that Jews were only allowed to have certain\nnames and my name was not Jewish enough and therefore I had to add the name Israel. Girls and\nwomen, who had no Jewish name, according to them it was not a Jewish name, had to put in Sarah.\nMy sister Elisa(ph), Elisa(ph) Sarah. My brother's name, Abraham was not a Jewish name,\nAbraham Israel. Joseph was not a Jewish name, because they had a Nazi the name of Joseph,\nJoseph Goebbels(ph) and same thing even though Rosenthal, Rosenberg is a Jewish name, but he\nwas one of the philosophers of the Nazis, Rosenberg. So, __.:-~\u2018Then another thing about this,\nwhen we left, before we left, we had what we call, what they call in German achmeldon(ph), it\nmeans to register, to sign yourself out. You sign in and you sign out. You sign out, so you had to\nsign out before you left Germany and go to the police and fill out that you signed out. So I went to\nthe police and I said, we are leaving on May 31st, I want to sign out. He said to me, \"Fill out this\nform.\" Filled out the form and he said, \"But you didn't fill out your address where you're going to\nmove to.\" I said to him, \"I don't know it yet.\" So he said to me, \"Never mind, we Nazis will soon\nconquer the whole world and we will find you there anyhow.\" And they were really sure of\nthemselves, that that would happen, you see? I said to him, \"I hope not.\"",
        "Q: This is maybe an unusual question, but was the fear in Germany at this point great enough that\nyou actually thought there might be danger elsewhere, or did you feel that once you got out, you'd\nbe safe?",
        "A: I only thought about one thing, I said to myself, I want to be as far away from Germany as\npossible, because one day there might be war and they might conquer the countries around here, so\ntherefore I thought that the Baltic states were too close and even England I thought was too close.\nSo when we, when we went to the United States, I thought, that's better, because it's further away.",
        "Q: So tell me about the process of your leaving.",
        "A: All right, we packed everything and we left from Hamburg, as I mentioned before, I had nearly\nforgotten this, but I found my passport, it says we left from Hamburg. And we saw our relatives\nstill, on the last day and then we were supposed to go by ferry, that passed on the Wednesday, I\nthink, Wednesday the 31st of May, in the evening. And we went be taxi to the ferry.",
        "Q: And this was, who all was in this ...?",
        "A: That was my father, my, and all four, all four of us. And we came to the port and, but our taxi\nhad to do a detour because on that day, it just so happened that Goering(ph) gave a speech and we\nhad to have a detour and he gave a speech on that day that was the first time that I heard it in\nGermany, where he acknowledged and told the world that they were good friends of Franco, Spain\nyou know, and that he was sending them soldiers and sending them all other things, you see, they\nwere supporting them completely. So we went on, we came to the ferry. Before we went on the\nferry, they examined us. I have to tell you that we were only allowed to take four dollars out, each\nperson, four dollars, it was 10 ricemark(ph), 10 marks, German marks, four dollars. It was all we\nwere allowed to take out and then we had nothing else because the rest of the money which we got\nfor the house was for the tickets, for the, for the boat tickets. So my father they examined\ncompletely, I don't know why they didn't examine us completely, they just made a checkup you see,\nlike this. And then we came to on the boat.",
        "Q: Now other than the four dollars a person, what kind of mementos did you take with you, what\ndid you pack?",
        "A: When we packed, we packed clothing, a certain amount of clothing and we packed a few books,\nwhich I had and also, I forgot to mention that the rabbi in Hamburg, at that time, Rabbi Kalibar(ph),\nwho was later, who didn't want to leave Germany and he was afterwards killed by the Nazis, he\ngavemea___, it means a Torah scroll, which I took along, but not, but which was put in the van.\nThe van was sent separately, we took only along a little valise, you see. So we took a few things\nalong, not too many things and a few pictures and jewelry. Personal things.",
        "Q: So you got on the boat...",
        "A: Now this boat was about 1400 tons, was a small boat and it was a very nice sailing from\nHamburg to England, through the North Sea. First it goes on the river Elba and then it comes to\nCookshaven(ph), which is at the, as the Elba flows into the... and up to there it comes to a certain\nisland, which 1s called Helgaland(ph), which was completely submerged during the war, but now it's\nup again. And up to that time, we felt. ~After that time, we all got seasick, especially me,\nbecause the North Sea is a very rough sea and we were supposed to be there on, when was it,\nThursday evening, but we didn't get there until Friday morning. And we landed, we landed in a\nlittle village in England, Grimsby, Grimsby, G-r-i-m-s-b-y, it's a little bay, Grimsby Bay, it's in\ncentral Britain, I think and we went there, we landed there and the, the company, the ship company\nhad made arrangements that from there they would pick us up by train and bring us to London over\nthe weekend and a Sunday we would continue from Southampton. We landed in Grimsby, England\nand we went out and I think we took a hack out, spent our first money and then we took the, we\nwere late to a train, British train and very fast, went all the way down to London and in London, the\ncurrent Whitestar(ph) line had a bus for us, I think us and other passengers who would be going\nfrom Southampton and showed us around London, saw the tower, the financial district, etcetera.\nAnd then they brought us to a hotel, a kosher hotel, this was the first time since 1933 that we had\nmeat again, because the meat was forbidden in Germany. __\u2014, the _____ was forbidden, right?\nOne of the first laws that Hitler made in 1933. So and we had a good meal there, in the hotel and\nalso there was a synagogue nearby, which was bombed out later, on the _, it's called the Great\nSynagogue and we saw that at that time. And on the day of Sabbath, the Shabbat, we went for a\nwalk, it was in east end in London, east end I think it's called and not far from the tower bridge, we\nwent to the tower bridge and we maybe walked over there, I don't remember. So we, so we went\nthere and was very nice there. Then on Sunday, we continued by, was it train, I think a train, to\nSouthampton, yeah there's a port from where our boat would be going. We came to Southampton\nand we went on the boat, was a 14,000 ton ship and the name I remember was Alaunia, A-l-a-u-n-1-\na, which was bombed during the war I think, and sank. And about three o'clock in the afternoon, we\nleft.",
        "Q: The other people on this boat, were they mixed, were there a lot of refugees or Jewish and non-\nJewish?",
        "A: There were Jews and non-Jews, but there were a number of, a great number of refugees, because\nwe found out later on there were some refugees who came from Poland, from Russia, from other\nplaces and to, we, they also went to Canada, because this boat went to Canada and, and my family\nstill had contact with them after they had left the boat in Canada. So we left at three o'clock, I even\nmade a poem about it, May 31st of 1939, the sky was clear and heaven fine, to make believe here\ngoverns right, but it was not so. So we went on this boat and it was supposed to be 10 days to come\nto Montreal, Canada, but it took 14 or 15 days because in summer, the boat goes further north and\nthat's a shorter way, supposed to be, on the globe, but about in a few days later, we came into the\nsection of the icebergs, because we went too far north and the boat was standing still for two or\nthree days in the ocean, in the Atlantic Ocean and we saw many things, we couldn't go up any more,\nbecause there were fish jumping over the boat, all right, that's not of importance, but we were all a\nlittle bit seasick, not as much as on the North Sea and then we came to, finally, passing by Labrador\nand ...\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A: I just talked about our trip from England to Canada and that we were kept for three days in the\nocean, because of nearing the icebergs. So finally we came to, past Newfoundland, Labrador, we\ncame into the Saint Lawrence River, the big river in Canada, to bring us to Montreal. We first\nstopped in Quebec and in Quebec, someone came to the, to the ship in, from a Jewish agency and\ntold us that he would expect us in Montreal and then bring us directly to our destination. Now most\nof the other Jewish people who were on the boat, knew where they would be going, they knew they\nwould be going to relatives whom they knew already, in Montreal, or not far away. And these\nrelatives would be there to expect them and they would be arriving. The trip on the Saint Lawrence\nRiver was a very wonderful trip and we enjoyed it. Continuing, we came finally to Montreal, but\nthe trip was very slow and instead of coming there in the afternoon as we had expected, we came\nthere in the evening about nine o'clock. And there is a certain regulation that if a ship comes to port\nafter nine o'clock, I don't know if this is 1n all countries, but were there, if a ship comes after nine\no'clock, then the passengers can either depart, go off or stay on the boat until the next morning. The\nothers, most of the others had relatives waiting there, but we didn't know anyone in Montreal and so\nwe preferred to stay on the boat. Next morning, we got ready to disembark and the man came again\nfrom the, from the JIAS, it's called, the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society and he said to us he would\ntake us and he would first bring us to a little hotel, not hotel, to a little restaurant for breakfast and\nthen he would bring us straight to the train station and where we would leave by train to our\ndestination. Our destination was Yorktown, Saskatchewan, that's where our cousin was living.\nHowever, it was a Friday morning and we wanted to stay in Montreal if at all possible, at least over\nthe Sabbath and we asked him, so he said no, that can't be done, because we have strict orders from\nthe Canadian government, that all the refugees, greenhorns, they are called at that time, greenhorns,\nI don't know from where the name greenhorn comes. Maybe green as the _is green. So what\nhappened? So the greenhorns have first to be, have, cannot stay where they want to stay, they must\ngo to their destination, because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take\ncare of them and the government will not take care of them, the Canadian government did not want\nto take care of them, they just wanted them out as much as possible, because Canada was not so\nfriendly to the greenhorns, because I know about internment camps in Canada, where people from\nEngland were sent to and stayed there for many years. Okay, so my father and we, and we children,\nall left and he brought us to a small restaurant and we had breakfast there and then he brought us to\nthe train station. Now the train in Canada at that time was a Canadian Pacific Train, railroad\ncompany I think it was and it was a small shack, I wouldn't call it more than a shack. It was a small\nshack and it was in June, on June 15th and it was very hot in Canada, we never had such heat before\nin Germany, was very hot and winter's very cold, summer's very hot. And we were sitting there and\nhe, I don't know if he gave us a ticket, or somehow we stayed there, it was about 10 o'clock in the\nmorning. So we thought of how, what can we do in order to remain in Montreal, so we remembered\none thing, that we had written to relatives in Montreal, my father had a cousin from\nEkatarinaslav(ph) in Russia, who was a tailor and who had moved to Montreal and we had written\nthem, but the letter had come back to Germany, addressee not found. So we said, maybe he's, he's\nstill living there, my father said and he was sure that he was still living. Maybe we can find out, but\nhow can we find out? So about 10:30 I think it was, there was a desk in the train station and two\nnuns came in, because Canada, Quebec is Catholic, you see and two nuns came in and they put on a\nlight and the light said, traveler's aid. So my father said, \"Maybe these nuns can find out if this\nfamily's still living here.\" So he went over to the nuns, but the nuns didn't speak English and we\ndidn't speak French. So what language are you speaking in. So they knew Russian, my father\nspoke Russian to them and he told them that we think there is a family living here, if they knew that\nwe would be here, they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown(ph),\nSaskatchewan. So the nuns said, but what's their name? Said Kaplan. There are many Kaplans,\ncome to find out, Caplan with a C, Kaplan with a K. What's the first name? Burr(ph) Kaplan.\nWhat's his profession? He was a tailor. What's his mother's, his wife's name? Bebe(ph), I think.\nSo they came and they took the telephone book I think, or address book that they had at that time\nand they went through it and they called up all these people and they called up and people came to\nthe the phone and they said, no, I'm not from Ekatarinaslav(ph), I'm not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera.\nSo they called up 15, 16 people, then they called up someone and there came a young boy at that\ntime, of my age, from the phone and he said, I don't know, but I'll call my mother, so he called his\nmother, his mother says, \"Yes, my husband's name is Burr(ph), he's a tailor, he came from\nEkatarinaslav(ph), what are you calling about?\" They said, \"There are some people who are claim\nyou are relatives and they want to talk to you.\" Okay, so made my father talk to them and my father\nright away recognized him, he seen him, he, not he, his wife, they hadn't seen each other for, at that\ntime I mean, 15, 20 years and she said, \"What? You're here? I have a son who is a pharmacist, his\nname is Jackie, so I call him and have come right over and we take you into our house.\" So we\nwaited about 15 or 20 minutes and then he came and he came and he took us all and we went to, we\nwent to the Kaplan's and we stayed there for a few days and in the mean time we did not go to, to\nCanada. But, what happened was this, in the mean time, about 11 o'clock, we had received a\ntelegram, I don't know how it came to us, it came to the JIAS, probably, because the JIAS had sent\nthem a telegram that your refugee, your family is here and we are going to send them right on to\nyou, so they had sent a telegram, Western Union, I still have the certificate and they said to them,\n\"Stay where you are, we cannot support you here because we had droughts for several years.\" They\nwere farmers and I was supposed to be a farmer and the young fellow at that time, who was about\nmy age, I would be his farmer, you see and I never had seen the family, just recently, last year only,\nI met him. Now he is 72 years old. At that time he was 20. So what happened 1s, stay there. So he\nsaid to us, the man from the JIAS said to us, that doesn't matter because he promised to let you stay\nthere and the Canadian government made us promise them that we will send them all back there, but\nthis is ___s = how we stayed there, through America, because the ___ out about it. _I don't know\nwhat happened to the tickets, but we stayed there, so we stayed in Montreal.",
        "Q: That's amazing, it must have been an amazing experience finding your family in Montreal.",
        "A: Yeah, see it came by mail and the mail said, not found. In Germany they say Unbekund(ph), not\nknowing thing. And I only remember this because my mother had shown them to me and my father\nwas sure that they were still there, but he didn't know where they were and if they were still alive\nand if they were living there, but that was of course, at that time.",
        "Q: Must have been an emotional experience, reuniting.",
        "A: Yeah. So we were living there for a few days and then they got us an apartment, not an\napartment, a room, I think for 18 dollars a month, a month and it was a shaky room, but anyhow we\nwere staying at and in the mean time, to get settled there, we needed a job and other things like this.\nMy brother got a job right away. My brother got a job in a hardware store because and because he\nworked with toys and he invented certain toys at that time, you see. He got a job right away. My\nsister, was very hard for her to get a job, so she kept the house for us for the time being and my\nyounger brother went to school there or something like this and my father, who was a bicycle\nmechanic couldn't find a job here and I couldn't find a job here, but, but somehow there was an\nemployment agency, the Baron de Hirsch(ph) Institute in, in there and I got a job, we got a job the\nfirst time, I got a job to bring flowers, like carrying flowers, bring, like a messenger. Bring flowers\nfrom here to here. Second time I got a job in a kind of a bicycle store to clean up the cellar, they\nhad had a fire, but they had a fire after us too, so we had to leave again, I don't know. How much\ndid they pay, they paid one dollar a day, one Canadian dollar a day, that was a lot of money then.\nThen finally I got a job in a chicken factory, not chicken factory, chicken business and I didn't like\nthe smell, didn't want to go there. Besides this, at that time, they wanted you to work every day and\nI didn't want to work on the Shabbat, __ want, couldn't get the job. Then I went again to, there\nwas a Jewish newspaper in Montreal which was called The Eagle, the Atler(ph). I went to this place\nand they would put an ad into their paper, but they told us, why don't you see Mr. Bromfman(ph),\nyou know this Bromfman(ph), the father of this Mr. Bromfman(ph). He has a Seagram company,\nthe year, big, what's it called, liquor company, whiskey company. Go to Mr. Bromfman(ph), so we\ntook a long, a long trip by bus and we came to Mr. Bromfman(ph) and we told him and they told\nhim that there are refugees and they have a job and so he said he has no job, but he was also, he was\nalso the owner of The Eagle, he was also the owner of The Eagle, so we didn't get a job from him,\nhowever, I went back to the Baron de Hirsch(ph) Institute and they told me they found a job for me\nin Saskatoon. Saskatoon is in Saskatchewan. Very good paying job, 15 dollars a week. That was\nvery much because what most people, 10 dollars a week was the average. So I went to, I said to\nthem, \"Okay, what do I have to do there?\" They said, \"You have to do this, and have to do that and\nyou have to be a man of everything, you have to be their hausen(ph) cantor(ph), you have to read\nthe Torah, you have to teach them, you have to do everything, for 15 dollars a week.\" I think I took\nit at that time, I said to them, \"I will, I will think it over\", but in fact I didn't want it. Then...",
        "Q: Now why didn't you want it?",
        "A: First of all, it was too far out and was too many things to do and I wanted to stay in the big city, I\nwanted to stay in Montreal or some other big city.",
        "Q: And with your family?",
        "A: Yes. So what happened is, my father found, in Montreal, another cousin. His name was\nFevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph) and Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph), he was already a little bit older, not too old he\nwasn't, only like 50, 60 years old. So he came over to us and he said to me, \"You went to\nWurzburg, to the seminary, as a teacher, you see and you were in __, go to the United States.\nThat's the only, because in Canada there isn't much Yiddishgad(ph),\" Jewishness, \"you go United\nStates.\" And at that time, just at that time, they closed it. Up to that time students could come very\neasily to the United States, but it was closed in 1938 or 1939, that you needed more than just this,\nyou needed a reason, other things. So, I didn't think much of it and I said, \"What can you do?\" But\none day he called us up, this Fevel(ph) and said, \"I saw in a Jewish paper, there was a Yiddish\npaper, written in Yiddish, it's for the Americana, the American and it said on the front page of this,\"\nunfortunately I don't have that paper any more, I hadit for _\u2014_\u2014.:~'\"On the front page of this paper\nis a big picture of refugees, who came to Baltimore and some of them came from Wurzburg\", from\nwhere I had studied, and he said he wants to show it to me and if I recognized any of them. I had no\ninterest in that, but I said to myself, \"What can you lose? Go to him and look at it.\". So I went to\nhim one day, it was in August, I think it was in August and, and he showed me the picture and I\nrecognized a few people on these pictures, I recognized them. Besides this I read the article and it\nmentioned a certain Kalibar(ph), Rabbi Kalibar(ph), not that Kalibar(ph), related to them. And he\nsaid to me what I do is, what I should do is, I should write to this yeshiva(ph) near Israel\nCollege in Baltimore, it's still existing. And I should tell them about this and see what's happening.\nSo I wrote to them, it's in here, and I got an answer right away and the answer said, \"We will accept\nyou. We will accept you. We will give you an affidavit and just come in. Go to the Consul and\nhave it verified.\" Now at that time, to get permission to go from Canada to Britain ...",
        "Q: To the United States.",
        "A: To the United States, was the Consul in Montreal, the American Consul in Montreal, he had the\nfinal say, not the Justice Department, they didn't have a Justice Department yet, the Naturalization\nDepartment yet, that was only instituted later. But go to the American Consul in Montreal. I went\nto the Consul and it was a very nice man, it was a British man, because at that time, Canada was not\nit's own country, 1t was a dominion, British dominion.",
        "Q: Even in Montreal?",
        "A: Yeah, actually, it was a British dominion, it said here, a commonwealth, but it only became a\ncountry by itself in 1942. Then it was independent of Britain, but at that time it was still dependent\non Britain. So I said to the Consul, I told them my story and he was very receiving, accepting it and\nhe said to me, \"But you don't have a valid passport, number one, number two, it's not so easy for\nstudents to get to the United States now, number two, you don't have citizenship at all, you are not\neven a Canadian domiciled person, because you lived here less than six months, because we came in\nJune 15th and this was August. You lived here less than... and you only gained citizenship,\ndomicile in Canada, after six months, so you are not domiciled person, so I cannot let you go.\" I\nsaid, \"But I promise that I will come back, because my family is here.\" He said, \"Still.\" So he said,\n\"I will do something special,\" he said. \"I will call my consul together and discuss it with them and\nthen you come before this consul and they can make a decision.\" So he made a, he called his people\ntogether, I don't know who was his high officials and I talked to them about the story and they said\nto me, finally and they, and they sent me out and then they called me back and said, \"We made a\ndecision, we made a decision that we will let you go, as a student, until February, because you're,\nthat means 60 days before your passport expires. Your passport expires in April 21st, we will let\nyou go until February 21st, under the condition that when you come to Montreal, when you come to\nBaltimore, you will have your passport extended by the Germans.\" I said okay. So I made the\narrangements, and so I had the permission here now to go to Canada, to go to Baltimore, however,\nhow will I get there? So I went again to the JIAS and I had no money and the JIAS gave me 30\ndollars, I think. That was the amount of the trip. I went with Greyhound bus from Montreal to\nBaltimore.",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you a couple of questions for the record.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: When you said you didn't have any citizenship, maybe you can explain why you didn't have a\nGerman's passport, why you were stateless. Because certainly you were born in Germany.",
        "A: In Europe, especially in Germany and all the countries, you have the citizenship of your father.\nMy father was born in Russia and he was a Russian citizen at one time. However, in, shortly before\nthe first World War I think, he came over to the, he came over to Germany, to Breslau and to other\ncities in Germany and he stayed there and he got married in Bremen, 1916 he got married and then\nhe stayed there and he had, he was working and he had his own bicycle business and motorcycle\nbusiness. And then in 1921, 1922, 1923, when Russia became Soviet Republic and they made it\nlaw, I think in 1933 was the final law, that anyone who left Russia before it became the Soviet\nRepublic, has to return in order to retain his citizenship and my father didn't want to return to, to\nRussia, because he just escaped because in the very beginning of the century, they would capture\nthe Jewish children and let them work for 25 years in the army, cantoons(ph) they were called. So\nhe didn't want to return, so he lost his citizen, he became stateless.",
        "Q: So technically, how'd you stay, had you been able to stay in Germany and you had had a child\nthere, your child would have been a German citizen, although...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you were...",
        "A: My, all my family is stateless. Only if you buy the German citizenship, because there was a\ntime, at the end of the 1920's that you could buy the German citizenship for 50 marks and they came\nmany times to my father's store and said buy, become a German, but my father said no. Germany is\nthe source of all anti-Semitism, I don't want to be and it was good, because afterwards they took it\naway from them anyhow. So he never bought German citizenship. He remained stateless all his\nlife and when we came to Canada, they became Canadian citizen, not I and when we came to\nAmerica, I became American citizen.",
        "Q: So you arrived in Baltimore by yourself?",
        "A: Yeah but there, before I arrived in Baltimore, there's something else. I, all right, when we came\nto the border, to the American border, they examined all my luggage and I had Tosefa Torah, which\nI spoke to you before, with me. They didn't know what it was, but I explained it to them. So we\ncame then, to New York, first we come from, we stopped in New York and we stopped in New\nYork in the middle of the night, 11, 12 o'clock at night. And my father had told me that he had a\nfriend in New York, Eiseman(ph), whom he had once saved in Germany, he was in the prison and\nhe had given him an affidavit and he was able to leave Germany and he went to the United States\nalready, in the 20's. And he had sent us an affidavit at that time, we could have gone to United\nStates in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go because she had all the relatives in Germany. So\nwe missed up on that opportunity. But when I came to New York, I said, \"I'm going to call up this\nperson.\" I didn't know very much about New York, we, we, at the Madison Square Garden, I think,\nwe, there was a Greyhound station. So I called him up in the middle of the night, of course, I didn't\nknow very much. So then I said I have to wait until the morning. Then in the morning I called up\nagain, six or seven o'clock now and at that time they didn't, not everyone had a telephone, there was\nprobably one telephone for the whole apartment house and people had to be called and come down\nto that place. It's a little bit of history. So I call them and I said, \"Is there a Mr. Eiseman(ph) living\nin this building?\" and the woman said, \"Yes, yes there are, I'll call him, I'll call him.\" And he came\ndown to the phone and he heard me and when he heard me, he said, \"Where are you? You are\ngoing to stay here for a few days, I want you to stay here for a few days\" and he will come and see\nme. \"So where do you live?\" This Mr. Eiseman(ph) lived in Brooklyn and I was in Manhattan and\nI didn't know the distances here, I thought maybe in half an hour he can come over, he said, \"No, it\ntakes me at least two and a half hours.\" Long distances. And it was 1939, they had the World's Fair\nin New York at that time, I don't know if you remember. So he said and he wants to show me the\nWorld's Fair. So I waited there in the Greyhound station and finally he came over, his wife was\nhome, I think and his daughter, they came and they came and they picked me up at 10 o'clock or so\nand we went to a kosher restaurant there and then he took me to the __ and _I stayed with him\nmaybe at least overnight, one night, I don't remember any more how long and then next morning, I\ncontinued to Baltimore.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. You came to, first to Montreal and then you were treated to the\nWorld's Fair?",
        "A: In New York.",
        "Q: Right. Did it seem at all strange to you that everybody was enjoying life and going, you know\nand celebrating and having a good time, when so much, so much was going on in Europe that was\nvery different?",
        "A: Yes. And I forgot to tell you something. When I, when we came to, when we came to Montreal,\nI forgot to tell you something. At that time I was still, in Jewish they call it the year of mourning,\none year of mourning after a parent dies or \u2014_\u2014__..._:I_was still in the year of mourning after my\nmother. I came there, we came there in June, 1939, my mother had been killed in November, 1938\nand I went to the synagogue to say Kaddish and I came to the synagogue and I wanted to say a\ncertain prayer which we usually say if someone is saved from a danger, they say a certain prayer,\nwhich is called Gomelbenchen(ph), you see and there were all people there and they said, \"You\ndon't have to say that.\" I said, \"Why not?\" \"It's not so bad in Germany.\" Because, I could not\nunderstand, as I was completely disappointed, that the people here in, in Canada and in the United\nStates, did not think it was as bad as it really was, because I don't know from where they got their\ninformation, because these people, these old men who were there and didn't want me to say it, I said\nit anyhow. All right, they were not religious, that's one thing, but they did not believe that it was\nthat bad in Germany and that it was America that we were saved, we were far away from Germany\nnow. I could not believe it. And then in America also, they enjoyed thems...\n[end of side one, tape two]",
        "A: So I couldn't understand the people in America and Canada, they were enjoying themselves,\nwere having a good time, and that they did not want to believe, or did not believe that it was so bad\nin Germany.",
        "Q: Did it make you angry?",
        "A: I was disappointed, because I, I, I saw everything, like miracles happened here, that I had come\nout, we had come out, that we found relatives, that I was able to go to Baltimore. They were all\nmiracles, because I never thought of that.",
        "Q: Did, did a lot of what you observed seem frivolous to you?",
        "A: Yes, I think they did not feel with the people in Germany. I mean, it was quite different in\nAmerica at that time, even though America is nowadays probably the best country to live in in the\nwhole world, but it seemed to me at that time at least, that it was more a detached kind of\nrelationship, that the people had with each other and not a kind of very close kinship relationship.\nBecause everything went like automatically. Business-like, more business-like. And we have, in\nour family, I mean they're talking about, about family life, but we had more a family kind of\nrelationship, not only with the family, but with other people, too. The people who came from\nEurope still had this kind of relationship, to a certain extent.",
        "Q: Did you feel a responsibility to let people know what was going on in Germany and in Europe?\nOr to warn them, to give them information?",
        "A: Whoever wanted to know, I told them. I told the British Consul in Amer, in Montreal and I told\nafter that, the Canadian Consul, the British Consul in Baltimore, I told, also spoke about this, I\ntalked about this and these people be more interested in knowing about it. But the people who\nreally should know about it, you see, they're not so much interested in this.",
        "Q: What other first impressions, before we talk about Baltimore, what other first impressions did\nyou have of Canada and the U.S.? Do you remember? I mean, was there any culture shock, or?",
        "A: I knew that, that first of all, religion was completely different in the United States and Canada\nthan it was in Europe or especially in my section, even though in Germany, many of them or most\nof them are not religious, you see. But here it was also different, as I said, it was more, how do you\ncall it, stylish. That means, organized and not so, what we call in Yiddish, Haemish(ph),\nHaemish(ph) means having a close bond relationship, okay? My relatives, I mean my father's\nrelatives, the Kaplans, you see, were very, were very friendly and they had ___ this kind of\nrelationship, a warm relationship. But in other circles, it was just to a certain point, as I said before,\nwhen I went the synagogue and I saw these people there, they more or less were for themselves,\nmore or less. They didn't care so much about what was going on anywhere in the world at that time.\nAnd I think that was also one of the reasons why the United States didn't recognize what happened\nin Germany until much later and Roosevelt had a hard time to convince them to, to do something\nabout it, the War Relief Fund and so, they came all much later. I hope it's not true, but that was true\nat that time.",
        "Q: Were you able, once you came over here, to get any direct information from Germany, from\nEurope, to sort of contin, follow up on what was going on?",
        "A: While I was in, while I was in Baltimore, let's say, I wrote to relatives in Germany and I got a\nfew answers, but all these answers were censored, because all the letters came back with censored\nby so and so and so and so. And in the end, I didn't hear anything any more at all. And some\npeople in Germany gave me pictures, I should do something about it, but I couldn't even do\nanything about myself.",
        "Q: When you stopped getting any information, did that alarm you at all?",
        "A: I knew that bad things were happening there and I knew it from some people, again from my\norganization, Agoutis(ph) Israel, because when I was in Baltimore there was one man, who came\nevery week from Washington and he had cousins there, he was my roommate, next door roommate\nyou see, came every Thursday to go back to what, he came from New York, excuse me, not from\nWashington, he came from New York and stopped over in Baltimore and went to Washington to do\nsomething about it. And he had very much information. So I knew that what, that what was going\non, that it was not good and he was working in it, in this organization very much. I knew things\nwere not good. But I knew, the way the letters came to me from Germany, from the, indirectly, I\nknew what was happening there. And they'd all try, instance, so and so is on vacation. That meant\nhe was in the concentration camp. Or when they wrote for instance, we had to change, that means\nthat they displaced them and sent them to another place, you see. I think once I sent a 20 dollar\nmark, which I had just how some __, I never heard of again, it was against the law, I sent it in an\nenvelope. 20 mark wasn't really so much, but still.",
        "Q: So in your first several months here, were you thinking about the big picture or were you\ndetermined just to get on with your new life?",
        "A: No, I, there were two things, or three things. Number one, I wanted to see if I could not get\nanyone out, but I had no money and the organization had very much trouble here, even in the United\nStates, because they didn't want to be involved. America got only involved in 1941 and the thing is,\nand, and, but everyone, every refugee, the refugees, they adored Roosevelt. Later on they found out\nhe wasn't that, not 100 percent, because whenever he got something to talk about the Jews in this\nconference, you see, he put it on the bottom, he didn't talk to 1t very much. But on the other end,\nthey didn't have anyone else to adore, so they adored him, pretty much and they thought he would\nsave it in the end. I don't have to talk about history. But when I wrote a poem I came here, you see.\nI was very much in favor of the United States and I thought it was the only country, you see, where\nwe could be able to do anything. Hm? It's the land of the future, you see, okay?",
        "Q: Oh, this is your poem? Why don't you read it?",
        "A: I only want to read the last two paragraphs over here.",
        "Q: Okay. This is a poem you wrote, when?",
        "A: When I came to the United States.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Or when I came to Canada, but it's too long, I only want to say, it ends like this, \"Land of future,\nour future. Everything we bring to you, seeking refuge we are coming, that is all we have in view.\nTo be treated in this country, __ rights, like you, the same. Not despised, disdained, detested.\nThat's our truly, that is our honest aim. Continent of mankind's future, world of sun and hope. Far\noff war and things of fight, on the western semi-globe. God bless you. From a land of terror, we\nwere forced to flee. God bless you America, you're the land of the free. That's on, at the end of our\nwhole voyage to America, you see.",
        "Q: Was it tough leaving Germany, even though you knew you had to?",
        "A: As I said, my mother never wanted to leave Germany, all the Jews in Germany, loved Germany\nvery much, it's a beautiful country and we traveled around there and it has nice sights and nice\nscenes and nice countrysides, but we saw there was no future in Germany. Not only was there no\nfuture, you would, you would be killed in Germany. So we left and we were leaving, just with the\nintention to find a better place, as I said here and to have more opportunity because there was no\nopportunity left.",
        "Q: When you were on the boat...",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Were you thinking about the fact that you had, unfortunately lost your mother and she wasn't\ntraveling with you?",
        "A: That was one thing, yes. But, but the further away we came from Germany, the more we thought\nabout new opportunities. And of course we were sorry and sad for those people who couldn't come\nout and who we had left behind. But we couldn't think of very much because now we had to be on\nour own and make our own. Some people left with money, very early in the 30's, but we left with\nno money, four dollars.",
        "Q: So, we digressed a bit, but you were on your way to Baltimore and you had stopped at the New\nYork World's Fair for a few days and what next?",
        "A: Then we came to Baltimore and I arrived in Baltimore and I called up the college, I called up the\ncollege and they were very friendly, they said, \"Take a taxi and we'll pay for that,\" and the taxi\nbrought me through Baltimore. It was a very long trip, I never was in such a big city, because\nBremen, where I come from, is a much smaller city, you see. So I came there and they greeted me\nwhen I came in and they were very happy and I was happy to come there. So I came there, I met\nsome people whom I had seen before, especially this Rabbi Kalibar(ph) I met and many others and\nalso the one who was the executive director, he's still there now. I also had met in Germany, maybe\nhis relatives, not him. So it was different, so I very quickly got adjusted to it, they gave me a room\nyou see, with two, two other roommates. It was on Garrison Boulevard in Baltimore. And I started\nlearning there.",
        "Q: Were there other Germans there or was it mostly just you mixed with Americans?",
        "A: They were, they were all kinds, they were mostly Americans, but there also some people who\nhad learned in Europe, in Poland and Russia and there were some people who were of German\norigin.",
        "Q: But not other refugees?",
        "A: Not at that time, however, I saw in the newspaper, which they showed me, and I might have met\nthem afterwards, I don't remember, they also were brought over by, by the college from Germany\nand _ in the newspaper. My name was also in the newspaper that I'm someone else from\nStrasbourg. Then there was the Rabbi Schwab(ph), who recently passed away, he also came from\nGermany and I knew him from there and there were a few people of German origin.",
        "Q: Now, you were training to be a rabbi?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that your intention when you were at the seminary in the Yeshiva in Germany? Or were\nyou just learning then?",
        "A: Then I was learning and I became a teacher, a principal.",
        "Q: So your intention when you were 17 was not necessarily to become a rabbi?",
        "A: It was in the education field, mainly.",
        "Q: I just wanted to get that background.",
        "A: Yeah. But then I decided I want more in the educational field than being a rabbi and later on I\nwas also mainly in the educational field. Social work and so forth.",
        "Q: Did you, did you have a congregation, I mean, did you practice as a rabbi?",
        "A: Yeah, I was at one time, I had a job in Mountaindale(ph), New York and in New York, assistant\nrabbi and that was probably mainly it.",
        "Q: In an Orthodox congregation?",
        "A: Yeah, different congregations in New York, but they were much later. Because I stayed in\nBaltimore from 1939 to 1945 and in 1944, I was ordained as a rabbi and I learned there many years,\nwith many other people and during the war, I can tell you, during the war, even in the United States,\nI was considered an alien, what do they call it? Enemy alien and I had to get permission to go from\nBaltimore to New York, each time, from the Attorney General, it was a woman, I went to her many\ntimes, put a stamp in the passport or so, something like this, gave me a special card. When I\ntraveled from Baltimore to Yonkers, near New York, I also needed special permission. And I\nneeded every year, an extension of my passport. So now that comes to this point. All right, they\nhad told me in Montreal, when you come there, get your passport extended, yeah? I go, I'm there.\nSo I said to myself, who can extend it, it was made out by the German government, go to the\nGerman consulate. At that time, 1939, yeah, Canada entered the war, I left, I left Canada on the\nfifth or sixth of September, Canada entered the war at, on the seventh of September, September, day\nafter. So I came there, the German consulate, at that time, America was not at war yet, so the\nGermans still had the consulate here. But I had no money to go there because it was 15 cents\nalready at that time, a bus in Washington, Baltimore. In New York was five cents a subway. So I\ngot the money, I went to the consul and I said to myself, \"I have to be very careful when I go to\nthese people.\" So I went up there. So they, so it was lunchtime. I didn't know that they have\nlunchtime in America and that there is such long lunchtime and they go out and no one 1s there. But\nthere was someone there, so I said to him I wanted my passport extended if they can extend it. They\nsaid, \"Yes, leave the passport with us.\" I said to myself, \"No, I don't leave anything here.\" I take it\nwith me and said, \"I come back another time.\" I never came back. I went to the Canadian consul,\nbecause I came from Canada and I said to him, \"I cannot get this passport extended, but I only have\npermission here until February 21st, so if he cannot get permission for me, extension of the\npassport.\" So he said to me, you see, and this is interesting that he made a mistake and that saved\nme. He said to me, about, he did not ask me about domicile, he just said I came from Canada and\nhe gave me permission to stay until June. Did he give me permission? Then I had no more\npermission and he said he cannot give me permission any more because I wasn't in Canada and he\nhas no longer authority to do this. So I go to Washington and I told them, \"I came here on this\npassport that cannot be extended and I'm studying, I came here as a student and I cannot return to\nCanada because I didn't gain domicile and I cannot return to Germany because they are at war\" and\nif I can stay here longer. So he gave me, Washington gave me permission for one more year and\nthey waived my passport requirements and every year, only every year I had to write to them for\nanother year extension and that I did until the end of the war. And then at the end of the war, I\nmade a, during the war I made a request to become a citizen. It was 1943, but I couldn't become a\ncitizen at that time because it was the height of the war, Stalingrad. He said, \"Did you do anything\nfor the war effort?\" So what could I do, I wasn't in the army, but I bought war bonds, but that wasn't\nenough, so they said, \"No, you cannot become a citizen now, but after six months, you can reapply.\"\nSo I reapplied again after six months and the situation got better, then I got the FBI to help me and\nfinally, in 1945, I got what's called first papers. At that time there were first papers and second\npapers, now you can right away become a citizen. Anyhow I had to wait five years in between and\nthen in 1951, I became a citizen. When I became a citizen, I changed my name. Why did I change\nmy name? First of all, my wife didn't like this name, in the meantime I got married, 1948, so.",
        "Q: In Baltimore?",
        "A: New York I got married, because I didn't tell you that after Baltimore, I went to New York. So I\nsaid, this is a Russian name and people cannot pronounce it and I cut off the beginning and the head\nand the tail, like, like a herring and I keep the middle. The middle is Wein and I don't like one\nname, one syllable names, so make it Weiner, so they make my name Weiner. It's in my\nnaturalization papers. During the war, I tried to do many things. I tried to be and I was even, air\nraid warden too, at one time, but then they told me, you are an enemy alien, you cannot be an air\nraid warden, so okay, I said okay, ____. ~ During the war, I also went to night school to learn\nEnglish and I had a very famous governor of Maryland, who was a teacher, McKelton(ph), I don't\nknow if you heard of him. He was a tall man and he used to say a word, he said, \"Winners are never\nquitters, quitters are never winners. So go on with what you want to do, don't quit. If you quit, you\ncannot win. Winners are never quitters, quitters are never winners.\" So I liked that and many other\nstory, but that's not about this. So I stayed in Baltimore and then in 1944 when I got ordination,\n_______, [had many friends there, I met other people too. I was working also with the Agoutis(ph)\nHistoric movement there and I, groups of children and to others and I send children to camps in\nsummer and so forth, I did this all there and I instituted something in Baltimore, three things I\ninstituted there because I thought, it is in the American heir that they are a little bit, so big, at least it\nwas at that time, to be a little bit more distant. So I wanted the people in the Yeshiva to be a little bit\ncloser, so I arranged something, they had only a loan fund, so I said, There are some people who\ncannot pay back a loan, we make it the charity fund and give out forthwith, money.\" Number two, I\nmade arrangements with the doctors who would give free service to the Yeshiva boys. Number\nthree, I arranged with some people to give clothing, free clothing, at that time people took second-\nhand clothing, today they don't take it any more. Number four, I arranged in the morning to wake\nthem up, Iran through those \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ Number five, I instituted a fund for medicines, because at that\ntime everyone had to buy medicine, no one could do it. I said, if you join this club for 10 cents a\nmonth, 10 cents, we give you aspirin or whatever you need and Number five, Number six, I institute\nsomething on the end of Shabbat, to make, to invite certain number of people and to have them give\na little talk and since we invited only certain kinds of people, only, we invited only certain numbers,\nso everyone wanted to be invited, so they came around. And I'm still friends with some of these\npeople who took over, one of them is now in Philadelphia, Rabbi Rosh Hasheva(ph) and |\ntoo, a good friend of his.",
        "Q: So you were trying to build a community that you felt didn't exist in this country?",
        "A: It was probably here, but not to that extent.",
        "Q: Were your efforts successful?",
        "A: Yeah, they were very much successful there. Okay, now, what comes now, after the war?",
        "Q: Yeah, I think what I want to do is just, kind of an outline form, you don't have to go into great\ndetail...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But tell me a little bit what you did after you were ordained, you went up to New York, you got\nmarried, what, what choices you made maybe and why.",
        "A: All right, first I got a job in Yonkers, through, also is through a friend of mine in Baltimore and\nit, that was like a teacher, principal and a little bit of a rabbi, because they haven't, they hadn't had,\nno, wait a second, _, no, yes, Yonkers was an orphan home. At that time they called it orphan\nhome, now they call it child care agency and this orphan home in Yonkers, there were about 200\nyoungsters of all ages, from six to 18 and I was put in charge of the people in between, between 10\nand 13 and most of them were children who, where the parents had sent them over from Europe\nand, in to give them safety and then the parents would come over later. I still know some of the\nchildren there. And I was giving them services every day and so to say like social work,\npsychology and things of this sort, that was in Yonkers. In Yonkers I earned, how much was it, I\nthink 100 dollars a month, but they gave me also, free food, you see and lodging and the person in\ncharge was not Jewish, but he was a very nice person. I remember him. Then I found an ad in a\nJewish paper that they needed a teacher and principal and rabbi-like, in Mountaindale(ph), then\ncome to my job in Mountaindale(ph), they had a number of people who applied for this, but I was, I\nwas selected and I stayed in Mountaindale(ph), it's in the Catskill Mountains, and I met very\ninteresting people there and after two years I said I don't want to stay there any more. First of all,\nthese small communities, they wanted a change of face. After two years, it's too long for them and I\nalso wanted a change. Then, I got a job in Newark, New Jersey...\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: Okay, after Mountaindale(ph), I had a job in Newark, 1n fact I had a few jobs in Newark, in the\nmorning and the afternoon in the Yeshiva and in the afternoon school.",
        "Q: Teaching?",
        "A: Teaching. Then I gotajob with ___ of teacher's seminary in Brooklyn and I was so to say, in\ncharge of the office and I also gave some courses in psychology and so forth. And besides this, I\nworked in, I worked in Brooklyn at the teacher's seminary, also, with the State Department to bring\nover girls from Sweden and they brought over about 500 girls from Sweden, who were stranded\nthere after the war. Sweden was neutral during the war. Finally, I also had ajob inthe _ in the\nafternoon and I also had a job in the business as an office manager, first in the burlap company and\nafterwards in a shipping company and finally I decided to get one job, so I heard something about\nthe city of New York, they needed social workers and I had gone to school here at the teacher's\ncollege, I got a degree from teacher's college and I became a Social Worker in the Department of\nWelfare at that time. Afterwards called the Department of Social Services and I started with them\nin 1956, I just jump over a little few things that are not so important and from 1956 on, I was with\nthe Department of Social Services for 31 years, until 1987. I had all kinds of jobs in the Department\nof Social Services, starting from social worker, to Supervisor one, Supervisor two, Supervisor three,\nAssistant Director, training division, foster care and adoption, child abuse and child neglect, all\nkinds of things and I also wrote certain papers and certain articles for the, for the Department of\nSocial Services. I wrote a book about how to get grants and, I don't even remember any more, I\nwrote a lot of things for them. And I was in different offices, I was in offices in Brooklyn and\nBronx, in New York, until then, finally I retired, in 1987. After I retired, that means 31 years, I just\nskip over it, then in 1987, I joined the, what's it called, the Jewish Education Society in New York\nand I was giving talks to different groups. Then I joined, the seniors too, I gave groups to senior\ngroups all over the New York and Coney Island, Brooklyn and all over. In family and family\ncounseling service, it was in the family counseling service of that department, that talked to families\nand you gave also individual counseling and I worked to the Training Institute for Psychologists in\nNew York and then in 1987, 1988, we decided to move from New York. I wanted to move at a\ntime when I can still walk on my two feet, before I get too old and we moved to Silver Spring. We\nhave three children who were born, 1949, 1951 and 1953, a son and two daughters. My son is an\nactuary(ph), the other daughter used to be a journalist and the third daughter is a mathematician and\nstatistician. Especially my son and younger daughter are very good mathematicians, they made the\nhighest score in the tests, in the Regent's Tests, I think it were called. But I started to work also\nbeside this, with different organizations, writing stories for children or writing articles, or giving\ntalks or learning Jewish subjects and I still do this, I recently gave a talk on, on __\u2018 Therapy, by\nVictor Frankel(ph), I gave this many times here, in the JCC, Jewish Community Counsel and I also\ngave it in other places and it was very well attended and I gave other courses, you know, on Jewish\nsubjects. And now, coming to today, I'm still giving courses here and there, one week in this\nsynagogue, one week in that synagogue and during the week with individual people, people come to\nhear, from Montgomery County, from __, from Baltimore, from all kinds of places. And I'm\nstill writing and trouble is, I have written many, I have written many of these things in __,, that\nmeans in certain parts and now when I want to write the whole story, I have to integrate it, it's not\nalways easy. But I hope one day it will come out complete. I always think about more, so I can\nnever finish.",
        "Q: Why did you choose the kind of work, which really you made your life's work, with Social\nServices and then an education?",
        "A: Because I, for two or three reasons, number one, I'm interested in education and in learning\nmore, like the perennial student, who always wants to learn more and I study a lot, with books and\nother things and I wanted to bring the people closer together. And, family life and, it's much easier,\nI wrote in my book too, it's much easier to learn how to hate than to love and then to be together and\nI know, there's so much, so many bad things happening in the world, with drugs, with crimes, all\nkinds of things, but we have to get in positive outlook to everyone, we have to do something which\nis positive, which helps to advance. Hate only brings you down and you have to bring something\nout, you see, which advances you, brings you closer together. I like to know people and what kind\nof life they have and what kind of life they made for themselves. And when I gave them advice, I\nalways gave them advice to do something positive. I even tell them, if they are not successful in\none subject, not to stay with it, to go into another one. I had a typist once who didn't know how to\ntype, so I helped him into another job. See, if you just let them go and you don't show any concern\nfor it, it doesn't cause for good relationship.",
        "Q: How much d 0 you think that the choices you made reflected your earlier experiences?",
        "A: First of all, I saw the relationship in my home and also with my family and I saw also with other\npeople that if they were close together, 1t was more successful and more helpful to them than if they\nwere separate or hating each other or doing something which was negative. I don't really know\nanything else, it must be in the genes of a person, you see, to do certain things, I don't know.",
        "Q: I mean, I have to think that some of the choices you made after the war, your value system, had\nto have been affected by your experience in Nazi Germany.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I'm trying to, and you've probably thought about this...",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Somewhat, to try and get a sense of how those early, very, very difficult early experiences,\naffected the way you are today, the way you became, the way you lived your life.",
        "A: Mm-hm. When I left the school, the German school, I went to a German school until 1936, the\nteacher asked us to write down what we want to do after school and why we want to do it after\nschool. So there were two things which interest me, number one, I figured out if I would stay in\nGermany, what would be possible, what would be open to me? There was nothing opened to me,\nnot in the non-German world, only in the Jewish world. So I decided to go to the Jewish teacher's\nseminary. In fact my teacher helped me select that. __|_ number one. Number two was, I saw\nmany people suffering in Germany, Jews especially and, so I thought I wanted to help them\nsomehow. Because they have, they have the same fate, they have the same fate that we have.\nThat's what I think it 1s, it might be more, but at this moment I cannot think of anything more. I\nmight come to think of more.",
        "Q: When you moved over here, what did you see as your greatest challenge, as your difficulties, if\nany?",
        "A: Before we moved over here, we had to make a decision when we want to move and where we\nwant to move to. When we want to move to I already told you, I wanted to move when we are, still\ncan work and do something. I did not want to retire completely. When I gave my retirement speech\nin the Department of Social Services, I said to them, \"Retire means to put on a new tire, to put on a\nnew career. Retirement means a new career and people in their retirement usually are more busy\nthan before.\" Where we want to move to. So my son, who lives in New York state, I didn't want to\nmove there, because they have a lot of business to do with themselves, they have their own family\nand they wouldn't have any time for us, not that I want people to have time for me, but they're busy\nwith themselves. The second reason I didn't want to move there is, there wouldn't be any chance for\nme to do something else, to get a job for something else. Cleveland, my daughter lives in\nCleveland. I didn't want to move there, the Cleveland climate is too cold. So we moved here.\nThat's our youngest daughter, she is here, living here and I think we could give her some help and\nalso here would be the possibility to get another job and I got some other jobs here.",
        "Q: But actually what I was trying to understand is, in your moving not so much to the Washington\narea, but to the United States, you know, a long, 50 years ago. What, over the years do you think\nhas been more difficult or more challenging for you in terms of adapting to the American lifestyle. I\nmean I know it's a long time now, but if you can think back.",
        "A: Do mean that originally why we wanted to come to the United ...",
        "Q: No, not why you wanted to come, but once you were here and living here, what, do you\nremember what ...",
        "A: What was most difficult to adjust to?",
        "Q: Or most challenging for you?",
        "A: First of all, there were already in America at that time when we came here, there were already\ngroups of equally minded, equal minded Jews, were already living here. There were already\ncongregations, certain places and therefore it made it easier for me and therefore I might be able to\nfind a job through them and I did. And there is more possibility and opportunity here than other\nplaces. It was not as hard, as difficult to find connections, see and to study and learn something.",
        "Q: So what you're saying is adjustment really wasn't that difficult?",
        "A: No, well, not too difficult here.",
        "Q: Do you think that there were certain events 1n the history of the last 50 years, that impacted you\nor that you thought about in a different way because of your experience in Germany? Whether it\nwas the McCarthy hearings or the Civil Rights movement or even the Japanese internment centers, I\nmean were there events here that you had a particular, particularly strong reaction to?",
        "A: Yeah, for instance, as I mentioned before, during the war...",
        "Q: You don't have to be so close to the mike, but you keep turning your head away from it.",
        "A: Yeah. During the war, that we were considered enemy aliens, despite the fact that we were\nsaving, they were not, they did not make a differentiation between those who came here because of\ntheir own personal persecution and those who were actually went along with the Nazi system. They\ndidn't make any difference here, they just considered everyone who came from Germany in the\nsame category, the Japanese too. That was one thing. And then, afterwards, I mean the McCarthy\nhearings and so forth, the un-American committee, see that it's not American again, not too much\nAmerican. I mean that was a, a leftover, I would say, from what the thinking was here in the\nbeginning of the 40's. Is means that they very much believed in, in pure American and anything\nwhich came from outside of America, like Russia, and the Communists and so forth, was\nconsidered, you cannot live with it and you have to fight it. So I think, but then the people\nunderstood that the most important here is actually to do something for the country, when Kennedy,\nwhen Kennedy came. I don't know if this is the right answer, there is no right answer to it.",
        "Q: That's okay. I'm just sort of wondering if there were certain events over the years that had a very\nunusually strong impact on you and, or that you identified with or that made you think in a new\nway?",
        "A: Okay. All right. At one point, at one point I could have gotten a job, I was even offered a job\nalready, in Portland Oregon, I was offered a job, in 19, 1956 and I got the contract in and everything\nlike this and I thought everything would be okay and I would be able to do this, to go there, to start a\nschool and certain other things and I discussed it with some of the friends here and some intelligent\npeople, if this is country that's reliable, if I can believe it and they said, \"Yes.\" But what happened\nis, I made already arrangements for the plane to go there and the condition was, my condition, that I\nwould go there for three months on trial and if I like it, I stay, if I don't, and fulfill the complete\ncontract, if not I would come back. But just the day before I was leaving, I was told that they\nchanged their mind there and they don't want to make a school there, they want to make some kind\nof a social program or who knows what there and I had already given up my job, which I had here.\nI had two jobs, I had the job in the Hebrew school and I had the job in the burlap factory. And\nfortunately, the burlap factory, they took me back right away, even though I had canceled with\nthem, the Jewish school did not take me back, but I didn't mind and the Portland, the one who had\nsigned the contract gave me 50 dollars, which was not very much for the whole contract, which they\nsigned, so then I decided, I'm not going into this field any more, because you cannot believe them\nand I wanted to go on something which was safer. Then I found out about the city of New York\nand I went into the Social Work System with the city of New York.",
        "Q: Now, when you said, a few minutes ago you mentioned Kennedy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why did you?",
        "A: Because Kennedy, in his speech, especially the first speech we'd seen, don't do what the country\nwants from you, do what you can do for your country, you see, that people should work more for\neach other instead of against each other and always expecting things coming to them, you have to\nin, put some input, you have to do something and I wanted some input also, not all, that's why I\nwanted to make my own school and my this and all kinds of things. Some input, not just just on the\nreceiving end. This is unfortunately, naturally, people like to be served, but that's not how we can\nbuild up something. So that's just the kind of input, and when I came here, for instance, that\nsynagogue, they didn't have a certain class, so I instituted a class there. When I came here, they\ndidn't have a certain kind of information sheet, so I instituted an information sheet. When I came to\nWurzburg, they did not have a newsletter all the time, so we instituted a newsletter and ___ to the\n______ and we told them some stories about, I would like some input. Giving something see, more\ngiving than taking.",
        "Q: What, do you feel, as a Jew, absolutely safe?",
        "A: Safe in what respect?",
        "Q: That, that not, that what happened 50 years ago would never happen again, that you are free from\nanti-Semitism, whether institutional or personal?",
        "A: You can never feel 100 percent safe, you can only, as an actual thing, you cannot be safe. In\nyour mind you can feel safe. You can say, I have done what I do, what I've wanted to do and I have\ndone this and that's how it will go, it will be, it will be. Things may change, things change all the\ntime. The only constant in this world is change. So it will constantly change and I don't think that\nanti-Semitism will ever stop. Because I see it, whether it's in Israel, whether it's all over, you see,\nthere are always people who are very self-centered and they want just what they want and they do\nwhatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people, hurting\nother people or harming or killing other people. So therefore, I can only feel safe in the way, what\nI'm doing. If you believe in a certain thing, you believe in this and then you feel safe.",
        "Q: Do you think that, that Jews need to remain vigilant?",
        "A: Vigilant? Only so certain respect. Let's say 1f someone is a very fanatic, it wouldn't help them.\nYou can only be, be vigilant in your own approach and what you are doing yourself, not vigilant in\nrespect to, in regard to other people, that will not help very much. Because one war brings upon\nanother war __, like it was in, in Germany. First the war of 1870 brought about the war of 1914,\nbrought about the war 1939 and so forth. So one war brings about another war, so to bring about\npeace you see, that's actually what our intent is, the intent. Everyone talks about peace, but no one\ndoes anything about it, like the weather. It doesn't happen in the world today. We have many\narenas of war and people talk about peace and it continues. In Israel, all over.",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you this, in terms of history. You left Germany in 1939, you knew if was\nscary?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You knew it wasn't getting better.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But I suspect you had no idea what you would learn later. That must have been somewhat\nshocking to you, yes? I mean what would you, when you finally learned what really happened over\nthere?",
        "A: You cannot always think of the worst, you, you think something will happen you see, how much\nwill happen, I don't know and then you have to be guided, like I did, by some principal which is\nbasic, by some basic principal which you believe by. If someone has a belief, then he knows\nsomething, then he, then he, then he feels safe. If someone had religion, for instance, he says, this 1s\nwhat I can do, so much I can do and not more and the rest I may, I may leave up to God or someone\nelse. I can do only my best, what I can do and every person's limited, can only do certain thing. So\nI will try my best. But then you really have to try your best.",
        "Q: But I think what I was asking is, when you got tangible information about the atrocities in\nEurope, what was the impact on you?",
        "A: I felt very bad about what was happening and I felt that something had to be done about it and\nthe question, who could do something about it and how can you help, but it 1s not up to one person,\nit has to be a group of people and before you change any person's, before you can change any\nperson, before you can ask any person to help you, he has to have in his mind that he wants to help,\nreally. So you have to find out what is in his mind, you know and by talking to them and how bad it\nis. Many people didn't believe it. And I see it many times, there are still people today who don't\nbelieve it. People only believe it if it hurts themself, if 1t hits themself, hits them or their family. So\ntherefore, I think the most important thing 1s education and therefore I was always 1n the educational\nfield, I wanted to be in the educational field, because the work education means to bring out\n____. Not revolution by force, but to bring it out for other person, every person has something\nunique in themself, which other person doesn't have and bring this out.",
        "Q: Was there a sense of celebration or satisfaction 1n the birth of Israel, or 1s that just something that\nyou...",
        "A: It was a momentary victory, momentary, because...\n[end of side one, tape three]",
        "Q: What we were, you know, I was just asking you about Israel and you... Let me ask you, I mean\nclearly your religion has always been important to you. Do you think that it helps you get through\nhard times, or that it affected the way you lived your life?",
        "A: I think it helped me lot of times and I also think that it helped me, not to get too involved or too\nmuch engrossed in thinking that this is very good, it wouldn't change. There is still, there is still\nthings that will change and not that this is a final answer, like what they are doing now in Israel? I\ndon't think that will be the final answer. There's a progress going on, life 1s movement, it\ncontinuously moves. It was good at that time, for instance, that many people needed someplace to\nlive and this was provided. But, as they saw in German, that the most pious person cannot live in\npeace if the evil neighbor doesn't want it. That's what Goyter(ph) said, he was a great German poet.\nSo you have to live with others together and sometimes the others don't want peace.",
        "Q: When you were living in Germany still and there was really a constant fear of not knowing what\nwas going to happen next, did you pray a lot?",
        "A: You see, in the beginning, as I mentioned, I only became more religious after my bar mitzvah,\neven though we kept chabiss(ph) to a certain extent and my mother kept kosher food, household, but\nin wasn't such a problem, you see, we didn't think of it so much, we thought it would always remain\nlike that. Because I had friends, non-Jewish friends, we playing together and we didn't think of, so\nmuch about it. Neither did they think so much about it, the difference between Jews and non-Jews,\nuntil the Nazis came and made it a policy, everyone has to think about it.",
        "Q: How about after your Bar Mitzvah and times were getting worse then?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That you, when you, did you pray for a sense of support or?",
        "A: No, I said the regular prayers you see, what we always say.",
        "Q: Nothing special?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But you continued, you continued to pray and to believe in the value or the power of prayer?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything you can point to, that might explain what gave you special strength, special\nskills in, instinct, to get through all of this? That you carry with you?",
        "A: I know one thing, that, I was the first born in the family, you see and usually the first born, gets\nmore attention from the parents, like in my case and they sent me to a school of higher learning and\nthey gave me piano lessons training. Not my sister, she always complained about this and so, so in\norder to give them a kind of feeling you see, of a little bit more than someone else, because like\nhonoring your parents, you respect your older brothers and sisters. But I didn't take advantage of it.\nProbably it made me feel a little bit, a little better, I don't know, you see?",
        "Q: It may have made you a little bit more of an activist, of a leader, which it seemed like you were.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: When you think back to Germany, are there any images that still stick with you, that haunt you?",
        "A: As I said, no I didn't say it but...",
        "Q: But now you will.",
        "A: As you know, my wife doesn't want to have any connection any more with Germany and\n____. I say, there were certain things in Germany which were very nice, you see and we would,\nand I would like to see it, I would like, let's say, for instance, go back and see where I was born and\nwhere we used to live. In fact we once went to Germany, since, since we immigrated here, but that\nwas only one day, but I don't know what the German mind is now, but I remember one thing, that\nafter the war, our neighbor, non-Jewish neighbors, wrote to my father a lot and they and I still have\nthe letters, in German, that they were good friends and they are sorry for what happened in Germany\nand so forth and of course they wrote, also said, they suffered a lot, but that's not comparable to\nwhat the Jews suffered, because anyone else, even I tell most of the young people, too, anyone else\nwho suffered, if he would accept the Nazi policy, would not be persecuted any more, Jews were\npersecuted whether they did or not and it was a purpose, so therefore I'd like to know, what the\nGerman attitude is now. When they asked me this question in the museum, you see, how I feel, I\nask them how do you feel?",
        "Q: Do you ever dream about Germany?",
        "A: No, not any more.",
        "Q: When you did, were there certain recurring images?",
        "A: It was only during the war that I dreamt about some people I knew and I didn't know what would\nhappen to them.",
        "Q: Now, your wife is also from Germany?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Besides the fact that she's a lovely, wonderful, woman, was there a certain commonality, a\ncertain bond that you felt because she was also a German?",
        "A: No, because I met her when we were still in Germany, she did not remember this, but I did, do.\nBecause when I was in Germany and I was going to the Wurzberger school, to the seminary, at one\ntime, in the last year, 1938, beginning of 1938, they wanted a foreign language to be taught and the\nquestion was, do you want Spanish or French. The majority wanted Spanish. After the majority\nwanted Spanish, they asked, is there anyone who can teach Spanish. I had had correspondence with\nSpain, a friend of mine, so I knew a little bit of Spanish, so I said, I'll try to give a Spanish course.\nSo I was appointed the first Spanish teacher in Wurzburg. And in order to make it applicable and\nhave people join this course, I gave a sample lecture in a big auditorium and she was one of the\nstudents there. She didn't even know that. And then we met again when we came to America.",
        "Q: Well the reason I ask is that it seems a lot of survivors marry survivors, a lot of survivors from\none area in Europe, later marry somebody from that same area of Europe and I'm wondering if\nthere's a logical reason for that and why you wouldn't have necessarily married somebody who was\nAmerican, or?",
        "A: No, there, and a few reasons for it, number one, first of all, people like to marry someone who,\nwith whom they can converse, I mean, who is on their level and maybe even intellectually,\nculturally and so forth and when I came to New York, my wife had an aunt there who knew this\nfamily, you see. In fact I knew some, I knew of a cousin of my wife's, whom I liked, but she was\nkilled in the Holocaust. And then one day when my wife came here, she made the contact and, so\nthat's, we had met before as I said, but not knowing it and that's how it came about.",
        "Q: So it wasn't a matter of either more comfort there or less comfort with somebody who doesn't\nunderstand where you came from and what you went through.",
        "A: No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is\ntrue, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless\nsomeone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to Iran, or go to other\nplace and marry there, but usually they try to find someone. Also I liked her family and the family\ngave me some, something, yeah, helped.",
        "Q: Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being\nsurprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in Europe and they didn't\ncare and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want\nto spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You know, that's the thing __\u2014__was trying to get at.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: I guess I have one more question. Do you think there's any way that the Holocaust could have\nbeen avoided?",
        "A: Not the way in which the German government operated at that time. Because in the 20's, when\nthey wanted to establish a democracy in Germany, ___ a democracy, most people were not in\nfavor of this democracy, or they didn't care and therefore, one government after the other fell. That\nwas one thing. Number two was, the Treaty of Versailles, in 1918, 1919, did not intend to create a\nUnited Nations, or what we have now, in the League of Nations. They did not want to, they did not\nwant to bring people closer, but they wanted to separate people and they made different countries,\nsmall countries, which didn't exist before. They made this a country, this a country, they made all\ndifferent countries, before it was all united. And all this encouraged someone like Hitler to bring\nthem together again and to tell the people, you see, don't worry about it, you are not treated well, the\nVersailles Treaty didn't treat you well and there's inflation and you can't get anything, no jobs,\nnothing. I will bring the sun. But he could only do this by having a scapegoat and he took the Jews,\nbecause the Jews are very, very passive in this way. So therefore, from this point of view, giving\nhim the power, people gave him the power, so that Holocaust came about.",
        "Q: And the passivity of the Jews, did it play into this? Should they have resisted more strongly?",
        "A: No, the Jews don't resist, you see, the Jews try to go along with the government, whatever the\ngovernment is. In fact, even here in America, after Truman I think, they mention the name of the\npresident in every prayer. Roosevelt especially, Truman. After Truman, I think. They did not want\nto, they accepted whatever, whatever the government said. Pray for the welfare of the government,\nso they accepted it. What should they have done? What should they have done?",
        "Q: Is there something wrong 1n our teaching?",
        "A: It has to be honest. The first thing that happened, what Hitler did, it was in education. He\nchanged the, all the pictures in the books of the kindergarten and who knows what and put in the\nJews with the big nose and with hook and this kind of thing and such a person you have to hate.\nYou can put everything into a child's mind, a child doesn't know the difference between right and\nwrong. They learned this only much later. So therefore, if a child does not get the right information\nfrom the beginning, everything goes wrong. And that's why this sof the \u2014\u2014___ and other\nthings, taught them wrong. Education is very important.",
        "Q: But what about our education as Jews? To make us stand up a little bit quicker?",
        "A: What should they do? The Jews education does not, does not emphasize war or things of this\nsort, or hate or, even the Christian religion you see, says love your neighbor like yourself. And\nmany religions teach, say this, but the difference 1s, we say and I don't know if I should say it, but\nwe say, that's a way to act, not that's a way to think only. Roosevelt said it. Roosevelt knew\nonly in mind, but not in action. Same thing also with religion you see, to love your neighbor like\nyourself in your mind, yes, but in your action, not. The action has to follow what you say in your\nmind, if not so, not so. So that's what they have to teach the children here, to really act, to be\ntogether, to be friends with each other and so forth, to have more kind of realistic system, not just in\nyour mind.",
        "Q: Well, getting back to your saying that Jews as a people are passive...",
        "A: It seems so.",
        "Q: They're supportive of their community or their government, that they're passive. Should we be\nless passive, should we be more attentive to what's going on and act?",
        "A: There are certain, in certain areas in which you should not be passive, but that I cannot say and\nmake everyone responsible for, that 1s, there are certain laws, let's say the 10 Commandments, you\nsee, they should be more active in those, not to kill, not to steal and so forth, you see, and just be\nmore active in that, not only the Jews, everybody. Because what's going on now with the drug\nscene, with the killing and so forth, they don't believe it. So, so there are certain, certain laws\nwhich, which every person should understand, logically. And that they should teach them and not\nonly teach them to think about this, I want to, I don't want to preach here, you see, you see.",
        "Q: I don't have any other questions, is there something you would like to add, that I haven't asked\nyou?",
        "A: Except, I don't know if I gave you everything, because it's impossible, there are too many things\nto be remembered and too many things which happened, but, if you want to build a world of peace,\nthat all people want to do now, at least they say so, then, then we have to, then we have to give\neveryone the equal opportunity, but it's unfortunate that many times, as soon as someone gets a little\nbit higher, he wants the whole, he wants everything you see, people aren't satisfied with a finger,\nthey want the whole hand. And, we wrote once, an essay, we _ wrote an essay in school, when I\nwas in the Nazi school and the essay was called, German loyalty. The Germans were always loyal\nto their leader, not only were they loyal to their leader, also they wanted to be on top of everybody.\nAnd they believed in the Darwin theory, the survival of the fittest, we have to be the fittest, the\nGermans said. Now if everyone thinks I'm the fittest and he will always subdue other ones and have\nweaker ones whom he destroys and that's what I want to end with. The teacher once, once asked\nme, he brought it out in a class and he said, \"The Germans are superior and all the other races are\ninferior, because we are the strongest, we are the tallest, we are the blondest, we have the bluest\neyes,\u201d and so forth. And, and he said to me, this was a Nazi teacher, \"What do you think about it?\"\nI said to him, \"There is nothing in this world superior or inferior, everyone can rise to a high level,\neveryone can go low. But there is one thing in this world which the Nazis don't recognize and that's\nthat every person's different and you don't realize the difference between one person, everyone\ncontributes something you see and you cannot put him down because he's different and him down\nbecause he's different in this way and he's different in that way.\" Same thing like happens in\nAmerica now. Everyone's different, they can all contribute and as long as they contrib, as long as\nsomeone thinks I am superior and you are inferior, I am a majority and you are a minority. Once a\nperson in my office told me, \"The Jews are not a minority,\" he said to me. \"Not in New York, \" I\nsaid, but maybe another thing. So I asked him, \"When does a minority stop to be a minority? I\nasked him. He couldn't answer that. But someone's, if someone works under the logical thinking\nthat he's a minority, then he will always strive to be a majority, we always strive to majority and\nthere will always be a fight going on, but the only time someone thinks I'm different, I have certain\nthings which you don't have and you have certain things which I don't have, then they will live\ntogether in peace.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Accept it or not.",
        "Q: Thank you very much. You mentioned a Nazi school and I'm wondering at what point you were\nin a Nazi school?",
        "A: I think I made a mistake, it should not be called Nazi school, but German school. Because when\nHitler came to power, all the previous directors and teachers were either asked to become members\nof the Nazi party, or leave the school. So the director in my school, where I went, the , had\nbeen with the Social Democrat party and he was dismissed. And from then on, there were two\nkinds of teachers, the teachers who were members of the party from long time ago, the early\nnumbers, all the early numbers had priority or a later number. But they came all in with the Nazi\nemblem, which was like a lifesaver and there was written NASDP, National Socialist Democratic\nWorkers Party, that's how they called themselves, with a swastika in the middle and one teacher\ncame in with a Nazi uniform and whenever a teacher came in, the students get up and says Heil\nHitler, when the teacher leaves the classroom, Heil Hitler, they all stand up. But that was, that was\nalready before that they would stand up, but that was respect for the teacher, because you were, you\nwere supposed to have respect for the teacher, the teacher was a high official in Germany.",
        "Q: So this was in 1933 and did you, what, did you stand up, did you have to stand up to salute",
        "A: I stand up, but I did not have to lift the hand with the Heil Hitler salute or the Nazi salute, but\nthere was, when you came into the building, there was a teacher standing and everyone when he\ncame in, would lift his hand. I didn't have to lift my hand, but then on the other hand, some people\nwho didn't know it, would beat you up if you didn't do it.",
        "Q: Were you ever beaten up?",
        "A: No, not for that. But I tell you, I saw a boy on a bicycle, he met a Nazi and he lifted his hand and\nhe fell from his bike, so they said on the bike, you don't have to lift your hand, just make, sit up\nstraight. But this teacher came in and one of these teachers who was from Strasbourg, Alsace-\nLorraine, which was French and German again, he called me over, his son was in my own, in my\nclass, in my class, same class as I am. He said to me privately, \"You know, I am not actually anti-\nSemitic,\" he said, \"but in order to keep my job, I have to put this life saver on,\" he said to me. And,\nand this other teacher I told you about, he gave a course in Assencunder(ph), it means knowledge of\nthe races.",
        "Q: And you went, you took this course?",
        "A: Thad to take it. The only thing is, afterwards they changed, that I didn't go on Shabbat any more\nto school, so this teacher was an older teacher, he was 65 at that time, he called me over and he said\nto me, \"If you don't come to school on Saturday, I'm going to teach Hitler's Kampf, Mein Kampf,\nthe book on Saturday, so you do, are not there. And if you miss anything, I will give you the, I will\ntell some student to give you the homework,\" see there, but still, some teachers of, from the older\nclass, you see. But they had to be members, you see and if you had and if not, they could be\ndismissed. Now him they probably left, he was going anyhow, retirement age 65 there, he left.\nThat's okay, but, but I help as a teacher, you see, when he gave this kind, so I asked a question, what\nmakes it. ~ Why does he know everything? So they taught that he has intuition that comes\nfrom himself Hitler does not believe in manifestation from above, because there's no one above\nhim. No God, no nothing, he didn't believe in God, even though he was Catholic. So there's no\nmanifestation from above, everything comes from the blood and soil and it goes up to him and he\nknows it by intuition. What they call a, I forget already the word in German, but it's something like\na combination of blood and soil.",
        "Q: What'd they teach you in the race class?",
        "A: They taught me similar things and they also taught me that the German race is superior. Why?\nBecause when God created the world in he interprets the bible, but not the correct way of course, he\ncreated man and then they believe in Darwin's theory, that the fittest survive, only the survival of the\nfittest, so that means the fittest survive and we are the fittest. The Jews are not fit, that's why they\nhave to be eradicated. And about this, what I mentioned before about inferiority and superiority and\nwhich I don't believe in, I believe in the same thing, you see, but difference, differency,\ndifferentiation, but I don't believe in superior and this other thing. And finally, oh, not about that. I\nwas the only student of 700 in that school, that was a big school.",
        "Q: The only Jewish student.",

        "Q: Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after\nKristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to Hamburg and stayed with your sister for about a\nweek, who was living there. What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the\nrest of your family was and did you have any contact with them?",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "Q: And what were the results of that effort?",
        "Q: Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described. First of all, were you\nat this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands?",
        "Q: And in terms of this operation in Berlin, what was this organization?",
        "Q: This organization that you were working with in Berlin, was this in place for years, was this an\noutgrowth of political organizations you were involved with?",
        "Q: Were you, my question is, were you affiliated with this organization or similar organizations,\nyears before?",
        "Q: And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization?",
        "Q: And you felt that was important?",
        "Q: And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's?",
        "Q: Back to Agoutis(ph) in Berlin, was there any risk to what you were doing or was this basically\nauthorized?",
        "Q: When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people...",
        "Q: How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them?",
        "Q: So you helped whoever you could?",

        "Q: So you went back to Bremen?",
        "Q: Were you and your father living in this Jewish house, community house now?",
        "Q: Why were they so nice?",
        "Q: Couple questions, I guess about school first. You said there were about how many students who\nwere able to?",
        "Q: And were they all ages?",
        "Q: Anybody who could, come?",
        "Q: Do you think that that school was helpful in terms of morale, in terms of education?",
        "Q: I want to ask you a few questions about the Jewish community house. Do you think that\neverybody living together served a purpose other than just a place to live?",
        "Q: Did the Germans periodically come to the house, visit the house?",
        "Q: Did people get around much or did they largely stay at home?",
        "Q: But when you walked on the streets, wasn't there a certain element of fear, a certain element of\nrisk?",
        "Q: Did people get beat up or anything? Or just grabbed and taken somewhere?",
        "Q: Now, to your knowledge, the people who were living in this community house, did they have\nplans, were the plans to try to emigrate, what did they thing was going to happen?",
        "Q: One more question about that house, because I'm just trying to get a sense of what the daily life\nwas like at this period in Germany. Did they, there was a school, people had to make arrangements\nfor religious activities or for getting food, or was there any culture or cultural activities, anything\nlike this?",
        "Q: Okay, your work with the Gestapo. Initially you said when you went in, there was someone who\ntook you up to Mr. Parchman. Were there always the same people there that you dealt with, or were\nthere different officers there all the time?",
        "Q: How would you describe your relationship with him?",
        "Q: Well, I'm trying to get a sense of how you, instinctively knew how to handle yourself, whether\nhe was particularly abusive and in what way and how you responded to it.",
        "Q: That was smart. Was he ever physically abusive?",
        "Q: Just verbally?",
        "Q: Now were you able, did you have access to special information because of this position or job,\nthat you were able to then take back to the Jewish community?",
        "Q: Did you tell him whatever he wanted to know?",
        "Q: Were there any other Jewish people who would go to the headquarters or just you?",
        "Q: One other question, you said you never really knew what was going to happen when you went\nthere, were you ever really caught off guard? Were there some close calls and big surprises, good\nor bad?",
        "Q: Now, you were at this point, I'm trying to figure out, how old you were, about early 20's?",
        "Q: 21, you were taking on a lot of responsibility, it sounds like you had guts and good instincts.\nWhat do you think prepared you for this?",
        "Q: Do you think that you got any of this common sense from your family or you just learned it on\nyour own in the way you were brought up?",
        "Q: So you worked with the Gestapo and the Jewish community until you were able to emigrate?",
        "Q: Right, but you worked as a liaison with them until the time when you left?",
        "Q: Is there anything else you feel you want to say about that period in Germany before we talk\nabout your emigrating?",
        "Q: This is maybe an unusual question, but was the fear in Germany at this point great enough that\nyou actually thought there might be danger elsewhere, or did you feel that once you got out, you'd\nbe safe?",
        "Q: So tell me about the process of your leaving.",
        "Q: And this was, who all was in this ...?",
        "Q: Now other than the four dollars a person, what kind of mementos did you take with you, what\ndid you pack?",

        "Q: But you were...",
        "Q: So you arrived in Baltimore by yourself?",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. You came to, first to Montreal and then you were treated to the\nWorld's Fair?",
        "Q: Right. Did it seem at all strange to you that everybody was enjoying life and going, you know\nand celebrating and having a good time, when so much, so much was going on in Europe that was\nvery different?",
        "Q: Did it make you angry?",
        "Q: Did, did a lot of what you observed seem frivolous to you?",
        "Q: Did you feel a responsibility to let people know what was going on in Germany and in Europe?\nOr to warn them, to give them information?",

        "Q: Were you able, once you came over here, to get any direct information from Germany, from\nEurope, to sort of contin, follow up on what was going on?",
        "Q: When you stopped getting any information, did that alarm you at all?",
        "Q: So in your first several months here, were you thinking about the big picture or were you\ndetermined just to get on with your new life?",
        "Q: Oh, this is your poem? Why don't you read it?",
        "Q: Okay. This is a poem you wrote, when?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was it tough leaving Germany, even though you knew you had to?",
        "Q: When you were on the boat...",
        "Q: Were you thinking about the fact that you had, unfortunately lost your mother and she wasn't\ntraveling with you?",
        "Q: So, we digressed a bit, but you were on your way to Baltimore and you had stopped at the New\nYork World's Fair for a few days and what next?",
        "Q: Were there other Germans there or was it mostly just you mixed with Americans?",
        "Q: But not other refugees?",
        "Q: Now, you were training to be a rabbi?",
        "Q: Was that your intention when you were at the seminary in the Yeshiva in Germany? Or were\nyou just learning then?",
        "Q: So your intention when you were 17 was not necessarily to become a rabbi?",
        "Q: I just wanted to get that background.",

        "Q: Why did you choose the kind of work, which really you made your life's work, with Social\nServices and then an education?",
        "Q: How much d 0 you think that the choices you made reflected your earlier experiences?",
        "Q: I mean, I have to think that some of the choices you made after the war, your value system, had\nto have been affected by your experience in Nazi Germany.",
        "Q: I'm trying to, and you've probably thought about this...",
        "Q: Somewhat, to try and get a sense of how those early, very, very difficult early experiences,\naffected the way you are today, the way you became, the way you lived your life.",
        "Q: When you moved over here, what did you see as your greatest challenge, as your difficulties, if\nany?",
        "Q: But actually what I was trying to understand is, in your moving not so much to the Washington\narea, but to the United States, you know, a long, 50 years ago. What, over the years do you think\nhas been more difficult or more challenging for you in terms of adapting to the American lifestyle. I\nmean I know it's a long time now, but if you can think back.",
        "Q: No, not why you wanted to come, but once you were here and living here, what, do you\nremember what ...",
        "Q: Or most challenging for you?",
        "Q: So what you're saying is adjustment really wasn't that difficult?",
        "Q: Do you think that there were certain events 1n the history of the last 50 years, that impacted you\nor that you thought about in a different way because of your experience in Germany? Whether it",
        "Q: You don't have to be so close to the mike, but you keep turning your head away from it.",
        "Q: That's okay. I'm just sort of wondering if there were certain events over the years that had a very\nunusually strong impact on you and, or that you identified with or that made you think in a new\nway?",
        "Q: Now, when you said, a few minutes ago you mentioned Kennedy.",
        "Q: Why did you?",
        "Q: What, do you feel, as a Jew, absolutely safe?",
        "Q: That, that not, that what happened 50 years ago would never happen again, that you are free from\nanti-Semitism, whether institutional or personal?",
        "Q: Do you think that, that Jews need to remain vigilant?",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you this, in terms of history. You left Germany in 1939, you knew if was\nscary?",
        "Q: You knew it wasn't getting better.",
        "Q: But I suspect you had no idea what you would learn later. That must have been somewhat\nshocking to you, yes? I mean what would you, when you finally learned what really happened over\nthere?",
        "Q: But I think what I was asking is, when you got tangible information about the atrocities in\nEurope, what was the impact on you?",
        "Q: Was there a sense of celebration or satisfaction 1n the birth of Israel, or 1s that just something that\nyou...",
        "Q: What we were, you know, I was just asking you about Israel and you... Let me ask you, I mean\nclearly your religion has always been important to you. Do you think that it helps you get through\nhard times, or that it affected the way you lived your life?",
        "Q: When you were living in Germany still and there was really a constant fear of not knowing what\nwas going to happen next, did you pray a lot?",
        "Q: How about after your Bar Mitzvah and times were getting worse then?",
        "Q: That you, when you, did you pray for a sense of support or?",
        "Q: Nothing special?",
        "Q: But you continued, you continued to pray and to believe in the value or the power of prayer?",
        "Q: Is there anything you can point to, that might explain what gave you special strength, special\nskills in, instinct, to get through all of this? That you carry with you?",
        "Q: It may have made you a little bit more of an activist, of a leader, which it seemed like you were.",
        "Q: When you think back to Germany, are there any images that still stick with you, that haunt you?",
        "Q: But now you will.",
        "Q: Do you ever dream about Germany?",
        "Q: When you did, were there certain recurring images?",
        "Q: Now, your wife is also from Germany?",
        "Q: Besides the fact that she's a lovely, wonderful, woman, was there a certain commonality, a\ncertain bond that you felt because she was also a German?",
        "Q: Well the reason I ask is that it seems a lot of survivors marry survivors, a lot of survivors from\none area in Europe, later marry somebody from that same area of Europe and I'm wondering if\nthere's a logical reason for that and why you wouldn't have necessarily married somebody who was\nAmerican, or?",
        "Q: So it wasn't a matter of either more comfort there or less comfort with somebody who doesn't\nunderstand where you came from and what you went through.",
        "Q: Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being\nsurprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in Europe and they didn't\ncare and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want\nto spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this.",
        "Q: You know, that's the thing __\u2014__was trying to get at.",
        "Q: I guess I have one more question. Do you think there's any way that the Holocaust could have\nbeen avoided?",
        "Q: And the passivity of the Jews, did it play into this? Should they have resisted more strongly?",
        "Q: Is there something wrong 1n our teaching?",
        "Q: But what about our education as Jews? To make us stand up a little bit quicker?",

        "A: My family was, my whole family was in Hamburg. My brother who had run away from Bremen\nhad also come to Hamburg. My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in\nHamburg, so they were all in Hamburg.",
        "A: My father was also in Hamburg. After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I\nreturned to Bremen and we were living in the same house where we had lived before. We were\nsearching the house and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything\nupside-down, we put the whole house in order and we were living there and repairing as much as\npossible. In addition we tried to emigrate and find a place where to emigrate.",
        "A: We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we\nhave no place, we like to help you, but we can't. Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November\nninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my\nmother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), Saskatchewan, if he\ncould do anything about it. This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of\nParliament in Canada and find how to get us special permission. And he would then send us what is\ncalled a landing card, that we were allowed to land. After a few weeks, we got this landing card.\nNow the question was to leave Germany. You needed first of all, permission from the German\ngovernment and they would be there when we would pack our things. But first of all we had to get\ntickets to go to Canada. My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which 1s a shipping company in\nGermany, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they\nwere all booked up for two years. We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to\nHamburg again and Hamburg had that, Hamburg had a connection with British Airline, with the\nBritish, not airline, with the British shipping line, the Koolnot(ph) Whitestar(ph) line and he met a\nman from there and he said he would get us passage to Canada. However, to get there, we needed\nfirst to go by ferry boat, from Hamburg to England and from England to Southampton, we would\ntake a boat to Canada. When the landing cart came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he\narranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to Canada. We were traveling five\npeople, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister. But we needed money for the tickets. In\norder to do this, we had to sell our house. Now there was one woman, \u2014_ woman, who the Nazi's\nhad planted into our house, she wanted to buy it. Of course she bought it with very little money,\njust enough money to pay for the tickets. So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact\nthe date was set by the shipping company, for May 31, 1939. On that day we would leave Germany\nwith the ferry boat. Many other things happened between December and May, 1939. For instance,\none thing which happened was in January, 1939. On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's\nbirthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family\nGreenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which said, \"Come to Berlin.\" I didn't\nknow originally from whom it came, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a\nJewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to Berlin and go to\nthis organization. He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, \"Go there\nright away.\" So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the train station and the next train was\ngoing at 12 at night, so I took that night train. But 1t was a very uncomfortable trip because there\nwere the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I\nwalked around the train. It was what we call a express train, where there is a hallway at the side and\nthen there are cabins in there. So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in Berlin, 1t wasn't\nmy first time in Berlin. It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk. I came to\nthe Brandenberger(ph) gate, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a\nsign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very\nquickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization,\nI came to the fourth floor and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we\nare waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of\ncourse, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to Lithuania, Estonia and\nLatvia, to the Baltic states and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation\nfor emigration to Israel. Then they would recognize us and they would go there. So the whole day\nwe were typing out, with the type machine, of course they had no electric typing machines at that\ntime, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission,\nthey were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in Latvia, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave\nthem to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from concentration camp and they came out.\nHowever, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered\nEstonia and Latvia and Lithuania and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them\nmight have. So that was in January.",
        "A: No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star.",
        "A: It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) Israel and they were trying, like everyone else,\ntrying to get Jews out. Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would\naccept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake,\nbecause especially the South American countries, Latin American countries were working very\nmuch with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American\ndiplomats very many times and they said to me, \"Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will\nlet you out.\" So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that company, to that country and they were all\nworking together. Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people\nwent out and they were not permitted in that country because they said we don't, these are illegal\ncertificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many countries. But the Nazi's\nwere very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see,\neither by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they\nmeasured them all.",
        "A: No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually. They were more or less a Jewish __\u2014__\u2014s more,\nI would say more religious kind of organization than another kind of organization. But all\norganizations tried somehow to bring their members or to bring Jews out, because I can tell you,\nlater on when I, all right, that comes later.",
        "A: Yes. I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934. They had such an\norganization in Bremen, where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist\norganization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious\nreasons and then there was a special teacher in Bremen, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he\nwas from this organization, from Agoutis(ph) Israel and I joined him. So I was already affiliated\nwith this organization.",
        "A: The focus was to work for the Jews to go to Israel, mainly at that time, you see and also\nreligiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more\nreligious instead of assimilation. It was a question of assimilation. It was a question of\nassimilation, emancipation. That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of\nuniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves.",
        "A: Yes. Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the school\ndays, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to school any more on\nShabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation\nmarks, more German.",
        "A: No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came\nfrom a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish",
        "A: It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done,\nbecause the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had\nthe final solution, you see and they didn't want them to __1n there, they said, \"The world does not\ntake them, the world does not want them.\" As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another\ncountry was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these\npeople go and go there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my\norganization in Bremen at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has\nnames, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave\nthem different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see. So\nthat's how they were choosing them.",
        "A: Whoever, yeah, _..",
        "A: These people sometimes wrote. If they were in Sachsenhausen, it say Sachsenhausen, near\nBerlin. Or Dachau near Munich. They wrote and at that time, we knew where the people were,\nbesides this, as I can tell you later, I had some contact with the Gestapo and they told me that, \"We\nhave people here in Sachsenhausen,\" and so forth and forth.",
        "A: I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on\nthis one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them\ngo, most of them. And then I went back to Bremen. I was still in contact with them afterwards, but\nthis was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that\nday and made it all final, in one day.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I went back to Bremen. Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at\nnighttime that they may knock at the door and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also\nin January one day they came, an ominous knock at the door 1n the middle of the night. My brother\nwho were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in Hamburg and they had sent him to the\nJewish hospital in Hamburg. First he was in Sachsenhausen and from Sachsenhausen, somehow,\nthey arranged with the Hamburg, I don't know who, how, but he was in the Jewish hospital in\nHamburg. So one night, they knocked at the door and I looked out of the window and I made\nmyself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, \"What can I lose?\" I go downstairs, I\nopen up. I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went downstairs, I opened up and he came in, not in\nNazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant\nfor your brother, Benu(ph), his name. I said to them, \"Don't you know that he is in the hospital in\nHamburg?\" He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through. They came\nthrough, they put upside-down the beds and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said,\n\"You should have known that he is in Hamburg in the hospital.\" He said, \"Yeah, excuse me\" and\nthey left. But they came in and they made a person scared, you know. They could always come in,\nmiddle of the night and knock at the door. I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a\nbicycle, we had a bicycle, to the synagogue, which was about, by bicycle, 15 minutes away, 20\nminutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind. So this was 1939, in January. In\nFebruary, the congregation in Bremen, the Jewish congregation in Bremen, organized itself again\nand they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no place any more to live, so\nthere was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a\nbrother of this Greenberg and they had a house in Bremen and they had already left this house in\nSeptember 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the Bremen\ncongregation. I met him later on in New York. But this was a house in the old city and there were\nmaybe 20 families living in this house now, besides that's the office of the congregation, was also in\nthis house and we organized it. So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things.\nNumber one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I\nknew a little bit of English, not too much. Number two, we organized some courses for women in\nsewing and other things like this. Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in\nWeisaminda(ph), which is near Bremerhaven(ph), that wanted some people to come and talk to\nthem, so I went there sometimes and talked to them. Number four, we wanted to make a Jewish\nschool again because the children did not go to school. I can speak about this later. And, besides\nthis, number five, they wanted a person from the Jewish community to be acontact _, going to\nthe Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe three times a week and tell them about what was\nhappening in the congregation, so I was elected, appointed. So I went there many times.",
        "A: No, we did not live in this Jewish community house, we lived in our own house, but many\npeople had no house any more, especially people from the small communities outside, you see.\nMany people in Germany, most people, most Jews in Germany, did not live in the big cities, they\nlived in small hamlets, how do you call it, villages and they came then to the bigger cities to be\nsafer. So they appointed me and I went to the Gestapo and I never knew whether I would come out\nbecause __\u2014_\u2014sdGGestapo was a big building which had no sign outside. You didn't know that it was\na Gestapo building. It was in a section of Bremen, they had and Bremen was a medieval city and it\nhad a trench around it and around the trench was a street which was called Amvahl(ph), it means\n______ in the war, there used to be war in medieval Germany, the cities had a wall around it and\nwhen I came there I had to push a button on top and the door would open and I would go in. And\nwhen I went in, there was a big picture, a man with two fingers on his lips that said silence,\nschweigne(ph), quiet. And then someone would tell me, \"Come upstairs.\" I didn't know who it\nwas, but I went upstairs. So I went upstairs, I went into this office and it was all clattered around\nwith all kinds of things and this man was sitting there and his name was Mr. Parchman, I still\nremember that P-a-r-c-h-m-a-n and he was nobody, an illiterate person \u2014.:~And he said to me,\n\"Sit down.\" Of course they address the Jews as Uder(ph) in German and they were very, very rude.\nSit down. Then he took out and I remember the first time I came, he took out a bunch of pictures\nand papers and he said to me, \"These are the pictures and papers which we rescued from your\nhouse.\" Rescued, you know. Was not rescued, they confiscated it. I said, \"Can I have them?\" So\nhe gave me a little bit, not everything.",
        "A: They did not want to be complete, you see, every person, even the worst person in the world,\nsometimes has a soft moment. So he also had a soft moment at one time. He gave me a little bit,\nbut what I asked him then, most of the time when I went to him, I asked him, \"Can you get this\nperson and this person,\" I've got a few names of people from the Jewish congregation who were in\nconcentration camp, \"I want this person to get out, can you get him out, will you let him out?\" And\nthat was the main purpose in the first part of my contacts with them, to save people, to let them out\nof concentration camps. Sometimes he let them out, but not very many times, he said, \"What's he\ngoing to do, where's he going to go,\" so forth. The second part of my contact with the Gestapo was\nto have permission to make a Jewish school, because the children didn't have any more school, they\nwere forbidden to go in German school, even in Jewish school, no schools. So what do we want to\nteach them in the schools? I want to teach them how to leave Germany as quick as possible,\nbecause that's what you want. So what would he teach them? I will teach them English and\ngeography and certain things which they might be able to use after the emigrate and also I will\nteach, I will give them a little bit of exercise, gymnastics or so, you see they have to be strong when\nthey leave. So they went on, they said, \"We have no place for German children and besides,\" says,\n\"when do you want to teach the children?\" In the morning you are not allowed to teach them, he\ntold me, because then German children are being taught and German children cannot be taught at\nthe same time when Jewish children are being taught and the other way around. So I, I negotiated\nwith him for a long time and he didn't want to give us a Jewish school or a place, then I said to him,\n\"What about a place,\" and I found a place, \"near, near that hotel there, no one is there, it's not a\nschool building, but 1t could be used as a school building and we can use it in the afternoon.\"\n\"When do you want to teach the children, what time? Because the German children go to school\nuntil three-thirty in the afternoon, you can only teach them from four until about six or six-thirty.\" I\nsaid, \"Okay.\" So finally he agreed and we had this place to take the Jewish children. Now I made a\nlist of Jewish children, we had about 40 Jewish children at that time, boys and girls in all ages, up to\n15 or 16 years of age and some of them came from small villages outside. But the question was\nteachers, we had no teachers. So I knew some merchants, you see and I said to them, you teach him\nthis, you teach him this and I'll tell you what to do. So we, we had a few teachers, you see and they\nwere not trained teachers, but I said the school should not be like a very slow, a very low elementary\nschool, but more like a middle school or so, like a little bit higher school and that's what it was. So\nthe school opened on April 12th, 1939. We left Germany in May 1939, end of May, May 31, 1939,\nso I was there just two months, but during that time, I hired a teacher, one of my, one of my\ncolleagues from \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s Seminary, where he was, had learned to be a teacher and he became my\nsuccessor and the school stayed until about 1941, I think, when all the Jews were in Bremen, were\nsent to Minsk and Pinsk, in concentration camps.",
        "A: 42.",
        "A: All ages.",
        "A: Anybody who could come.",
        "A: Yes, it was very helpful I think, because the parents, I mean when we had our first meeting and I\ngave them the introductory talk about what the school was going to be and what we would be\nteaching and so the parents also came and it was very helpful and in fact, I met two of my students\nfrom that time in New York later on. In fact, one of my, one of, no, at least two students who I met\nin New York, they are now married, you know and their husbands came to my classes here, which I\ngave here in America. So, it was helpful, I think.\n[end of side one, tape one]",
        "A: Yes. First of all, it was safer, they felt safer being together, you see, being among friends, being\namong people of their own kind, I mean, that already makes them feel safer. And besides this, if\nthey had any problems, they had right away in that house, people whom they could ask and turn to,\nbecause these, and these, their Jewish community you see, had contacts with getting food, getting\nother things and so forth.",
        "A: They knew about it. I don't remember any more, if they came, because I wasn't living there, you\nsee.",
        "A: No, at that time it was still possible to walk around, to go places, it was possible. The first time\nthat actually, I mean that was long time ago, if they remember the first boycott, which was 1933\n____, but at that time, you could go, you could walk around, of course you had to be careful and\nthe Nazis were not all, Nazis, you see. There were also some Germans who still thought, it will pass\nover.",
        "A: Yes, you felt things might come, as I mentioned before, especially during the night. The Nazis\nwere using what is called two things. They were using deception and dehumanization. That means\nthey were deceiving people and make believe it was not so, it's not bad, you can do what you want,\nyou see, so people went around, but they were never safe if something would happen to them. So\nthey were careful and they walked around usually, not by themself, but with a friend, with others.",
        "A: That happened usually during the night when no one saw it, because Nazis did not want to do\nanything during daytime, actually. That's why all the time, they were still a little bit reluctant to do\nthings so openly, because they didn't want the world, the press to know about that, that they do do it\nopenly. They wanted the world to know and to fear that whatever they did is by law. Therefore\nthey made a law, Jews cannot go to school any more. They made a law, lawyers cannot have\npractice in here any more and things like this, they wanted to do everything by law.",
        "A: At that time, after Krystallnacht, the whole world saw and the Jews also knew, even those Jews\nwho still loved Germany and they lived in Germany for a long time and they had family trees and\nthey had ancestors, they saw that you cannot live in Germany any more. So everyone from that\nmoment on, worked on emigration, to find out the place where to go, because they knew there was\nno, that's why I called my school the Dead End school, it was only toward an end, because we knew\nwe wouldn't exist forever. There would come a time, you see, when we would have to close and we\ndid close afterwards.",
        "A: Well, they had ___ services, religious services in this building, they had some classes, you see,\nI also gave some classes as I said before, for translation for English and so forth and __.\nHowever, the community in Bremen consists actually of two types of Jews, there's one type of Jews\nwhich were the German Jews who were born in Germany and who lived there a long time. Then\nthere were, was a little community, a little bit away from Bremen of Eastern Jews. They call it in\nGerman _, who came from eastern. I was very friendly with them, you see, because I went\nthere many times. They had their own community. But they had all their culture alive, because\nwhen they stay together, you see, they either were learning a few subjects or they were preparing for\nemigration, they were taking your job, they were learning a language, they were learning something\nelse.",
        "A: They were all different, but I had this particular person, Mr. Parchman. I always saw him, most\nof the ttme. He was__sinchargeofthe Jews _ problem. He was in charge and so I had to see\nhim because he was the one appointed by the Nazis to have the contact with us. So I always saw the\nsame person.",
        "A: I never knew what he would say. I never knew what he would say, but I never knew whether,\nwhether he would let me go out again. I never knew what kind of questions he would ask me. But I\ntold him all the time, as I mentioned before, I was working on two, in two areas with him, first of all\nto get Jews out of concentration camps, number two to have a school. And that was my main\nrelationship with him and he was sitting there with his feet on the table and, and trying to degrade\nme, __ sit down and things like this, but I did not really play, play a game with him to say that I\nwould do everything what he wanted me to do or so, but, but you have to know what, about what\nyou want to say and you have to feel what, how he would react. I never knew how he would react,\nbut I just was normal, normally, normal. I don't know if is this what you mean.",
        "A: I tried not to make him feel embarrassed or attack the Nazi system. I just talked from my point\nof view, that means when my point of view, the point of view of the Jews you see, that we are here\nnow and I know that you don't want us here and we want to leave and that was always my basic\nphilosophy, my basic philosophy was let the Jews out of the concentration camps, so that they can\nleave Germany, let us make a school, so that we can prepare them for emigration. It was always,\nmy philosophy was always to get out of Germany and that's really what he wanted, so I actually\nplayed on his wavelengths.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, for instance, sometimes he would tell me, we let these people out in three days, or this\nperson is now in the concentration camp. He would give me some names sometimes, but most of\nthe time he didn't want to give information, he wanted information from me. He wanted\ninformation, you see, what are the Jews doing there? I mean, do they have money, do they emigrate\nand things, well how far are they, do we have services, what do you do? He wanted from me, but I\ngot something from him too.",
        "A: I sometimes told him and sometimes not. For instance, he asked me, from where are these? And\nhe showed me all the things which he had taken out of our house __\u2014.:~XHe asked me, \"Do you\nknow this, do you know this?\" So I said to him, \"You know better than I do, because you took it\nout. So where did you find it, what did you do with it.\" No, I never, no.",
        "A: I would go there regularly, I don't think anyone else would go. He would sometimes come, I\ndon't even know if he would come to the president, I know Mr. Ostrich(ph), I think his name was, I\ndon't remember his name. If he wanted something, he, but I was the one who would go there, I\nthink I was the only one who would go there.",
        "A: I don't remember anything of this sort. No, he always considered himself a nice guy, quotation\nmark, by letting me go again and when I asked for instance, my brother should come out of the\nconcentration camp, I mean, he let him out of the concentration camp. I don't know now, it's too\nlong ago, whether it was, probably a both combination of him and the Jewish hospital in Hamburg,\nsomehow a combination, I don't know how they worked together and he came out. But I never had\na clash with him in that way that he surprised me with something or not. He surprised me the very\nfirst time, that he had all the things, I was surprised that he had all these things which he had taken\nout of our house.",
        "A: Yeah. 21.",
        "A: Ihave a philosophy you see, if possible to make a compromise and I had to make a compromise,\nin school for instance, when I went to the Nazi school. And besides this I made a compromise when\nI went with the Zionist youth club and, and when I went to Frankfurt, I studied at the sin\nFrankfurt and then afterwards I went to Wurzburg and I tried to bring people closer and make them\naccept it and so forth all the time, so I think I had this kind of thing, even I talked to the Nazi\nteachers in school, I always tried to compromise in a certain way, but not give up my principles,\nbecause when the teachers told me that you cannot go to school any more, I mentioned this already\nbefore and I just said to him, \"We are on the same wavelength, you be a Nazi and I be a Jew.\" So\nyou go your way and learn more about Germany and I am a Jew and I want to learn more about\nbeing a Jew.",
        "A: Part of it, of course, I got from my family, especially my mother. She came from Hamburg and\nshe was always welcomed and she was always recognized and tried to make people friendly and in\nour business you see, when people came to our business buying and selling, for repairs and so forth,\nshe did favors for all these people. She wrote letters for them. At that time, we didn't have\ntypewriters, so people wrote longhand, she had a very good handwriting, so she wrote letters for\nthem. And my father, who came from Russia, also and then of course myself, because since I went\nto a non-Jewish school, I had to do, excuse me, since I went to a non-Jewish school, I had to be able\nto live together with them and to talk to them you see, not only about myself, but also about them\nand so forth. So I had a lot of friends and even had so many friends in my class that even after |\ncameto __, they wanted to make me class president, but I didn't want to.",
        "A: Not through them. The reason they, as I started to tell you before, we wrote to all people and we\ngot the landing cards from my cousin, from my father's cousin and then my father arranged for us to\nemigrate, so it really came from the outside, it didn't come from the Nazis.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, there is one thing, we started the school on April 12th, 1939 and I went there every day, I\ndon't, I think we only were allowed to be in the school two or three times a week and then when we\nhad to give up the whole house, our whole house, so I was there when we packed, we packed the\nvan and the man was standing there. Some people tried to slip in certain things, but I was afraid to\nput in anything else. I wanted to put in some newspapers from Germany, where they spoke about\nthe Nazis, one paper I put in, about there was a law that Jews were only allowed to have certain\nnames and my name was not Jewish enough and therefore I had to add the name Israel. Girls and\nwomen, who had no Jewish name, according to them it was not a Jewish name, had to put in Sarah.\nMy sister Elisa(ph), Elisa(ph) Sarah. My brother's name, Abraham was not a Jewish name,\nAbraham Israel. Joseph was not a Jewish name, because they had a Nazi the name of Joseph,\nJoseph Goebbels(ph) and same thing even though Rosenthal, Rosenberg is a Jewish name, but he\nwas one of the philosophers of the Nazis, Rosenberg. So, __.:-~\u2018Then another thing about this,\nwhen we left, before we left, we had what we call, what they call in German achmeldon(ph), it\nmeans to register, to sign yourself out. You sign in and you sign out. You sign out, so you had to\nsign out before you left Germany and go to the police and fill out that you signed out. So I went to\nthe police and I said, we are leaving on May 31st, I want to sign out. He said to me, \"Fill out this\nform.\" Filled out the form and he said, \"But you didn't fill out your address where you're going to\nmove to.\" I said to him, \"I don't know it yet.\" So he said to me, \"Never mind, we Nazis will soon\nconquer the whole world and we will find you there anyhow.\" And they were really sure of\nthemselves, that that would happen, you see? I said to him, \"I hope not.\"",
        "A: I only thought about one thing, I said to myself, I want to be as far away from Germany as\npossible, because one day there might be war and they might conquer the countries around here, so\ntherefore I thought that the Baltic states were too close and even England I thought was too close.\nSo when we, when we went to the United States, I thought, that's better, because it's further away.",
        "A: All right, we packed everything and we left from Hamburg, as I mentioned before, I had nearly\nforgotten this, but I found my passport, it says we left from Hamburg. And we saw our relatives\nstill, on the last day and then we were supposed to go by ferry, that passed on the Wednesday, I\nthink, Wednesday the 31st of May, in the evening. And we went be taxi to the ferry.",
        "A: That was my father, my, and all four, all four of us. And we came to the port and, but our taxi\nhad to do a detour because on that day, it just so happened that Goering(ph) gave a speech and we\nhad to have a detour and he gave a speech on that day that was the first time that I heard it in\nGermany, where he acknowledged and told the world that they were good friends of Franco, Spain\nyou know, and that he was sending them soldiers and sending them all other things, you see, they\nwere supporting them completely. So we went on, we came to the ferry. Before we went on the\nferry, they examined us. I have to tell you that we were only allowed to take four dollars out, each\nperson, four dollars, it was 10 ricemark(ph), 10 marks, German marks, four dollars. It was all we\nwere allowed to take out and then we had nothing else because the rest of the money which we got\nfor the house was for the tickets, for the, for the boat tickets. So my father they examined\ncompletely, I don't know why they didn't examine us completely, they just made a checkup you see,\nlike this. And then we came to on the boat.",
        "A: When we packed, we packed clothing, a certain amount of clothing and we packed a few books,\nwhich I had and also, I forgot to mention that the rabbi in Hamburg, at that time, Rabbi Kalibar(ph),\nwho was later, who didn't want to leave Germany and he was afterwards killed by the Nazis, he\ngavemea___, it means a Torah scroll, which I took along, but not, but which was put in the van.\nThe van was sent separately, we took only along a little valise, you see. So we took a few things\nalong, not too many things and a few pictures and jewelry. Personal things.",
        "A: Now this boat was about 1400 tons, was a small boat and it was a very nice sailing from\nHamburg to England, through the North Sea. First it goes on the river Elba and then it comes to\nCookshaven(ph), which is at the, as the Elba flows into the... and up to there it comes to a certain\nisland, which 1s called Helgaland(ph), which was completely submerged during the war, but now it's\nup again. And up to that time, we felt. ~After that time, we all got seasick, especially me,\nbecause the North Sea is a very rough sea and we were supposed to be there on, when was it,\nThursday evening, but we didn't get there until Friday morning. And we landed, we landed in a\nlittle village in England, Grimsby, Grimsby, G-r-i-m-s-b-y, it's a little bay, Grimsby Bay, it's in\ncentral Britain, I think and we went there, we landed there and the, the company, the ship company\nhad made arrangements that from there they would pick us up by train and bring us to London over\nthe weekend and a Sunday we would continue from Southampton. We landed in Grimsby, England\nand we went out and I think we took a hack out, spent our first money and then we took the, we\nwere late to a train, British train and very fast, went all the way down to London and in London, the\ncurrent Whitestar(ph) line had a bus for us, I think us and other passengers who would be going\nfrom Southampton and showed us around London, saw the tower, the financial district, etcetera.\nAnd then they brought us to a hotel, a kosher hotel, this was the first time since 1933 that we had\nmeat again, because the meat was forbidden in Germany. __\u2014, the _____ was forbidden, right?\nOne of the first laws that Hitler made in 1933. So and we had a good meal there, in the hotel and\nalso there was a synagogue nearby, which was bombed out later, on the _, it's called the Great\nSynagogue and we saw that at that time. And on the day of Sabbath, the Shabbat, we went for a\nwalk, it was in east end in London, east end I think it's called and not far from the tower bridge, we\nwent to the tower bridge and we maybe walked over there, I don't remember. So we, so we went\nthere and was very nice there. Then on Sunday, we continued by, was it train, I think a train, to\nSouthampton, yeah there's a port from where our boat would be going. We came to Southampton\nand we went on the boat, was a 14,000 ton ship and the name I remember was Alaunia, A-l-a-u-n-1-\na, which was bombed during the war I think, and sank. And about three o'clock in the afternoon, we\nleft.",
        "A: There were Jews and non-Jews, but there were a number of, a great number of refugees, because\nwe found out later on there were some refugees who came from Poland, from Russia, from other\nplaces and to, we, they also went to Canada, because this boat went to Canada and, and my family\nstill had contact with them after they had left the boat in Canada. So we left at three o'clock, I even\nmade a poem about it, May 31st of 1939, the sky was clear and heaven fine, to make believe here\ngoverns right, but it was not so. So we went on this boat and it was supposed to be 10 days to come\nto Montreal, Canada, but it took 14 or 15 days because in summer, the boat goes further north and\nthat's a shorter way, supposed to be, on the globe, but about in a few days later, we came into the\nsection of the icebergs, because we went too far north and the boat was standing still for two or\nthree days in the ocean, in the Atlantic Ocean and we saw many things, we couldn't go up any more,\nbecause there were fish jumping over the boat, all right, that's not of importance, but we were all a\nlittle bit seasick, not as much as on the North Sea and then we came to, finally, passing by Labrador\nand ...\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A: I just talked about our trip from England to Canada and that we were kept for three days in the\nocean, because of nearing the icebergs. So finally we came to, past Newfoundland, Labrador, we\ncame into the Saint Lawrence River, the big river in Canada, to bring us to Montreal. We first\nstopped in Quebec and in Quebec, someone came to the, to the ship in, from a Jewish agency and\ntold us that he would expect us in Montreal and then bring us directly to our destination. Now most\nof the other Jewish people who were on the boat, knew where they would be going, they knew they\nwould be going to relatives whom they knew already, in Montreal, or not far away. And these\nrelatives would be there to expect them and they would be arriving. The trip on the Saint Lawrence\nRiver was a very wonderful trip and we enjoyed it. Continuing, we came finally to Montreal, but\nthe trip was very slow and instead of coming there in the afternoon as we had expected, we came\nthere in the evening about nine o'clock. And there is a certain regulation that if a ship comes to port\nafter nine o'clock, I don't know if this is 1n all countries, but were there, if a ship comes after nine\no'clock, then the passengers can either depart, go off or stay on the boat until the next morning. The\nothers, most of the others had relatives waiting there, but we didn't know anyone in Montreal and so\nwe preferred to stay on the boat. Next morning, we got ready to disembark and the man came again\nfrom the, from the JIAS, it's called, the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society and he said to us he would\ntake us and he would first bring us to a little hotel, not hotel, to a little restaurant for breakfast and\nthen he would bring us straight to the train station and where we would leave by train to our\ndestination. Our destination was Yorktown, Saskatchewan, that's where our cousin was living.\nHowever, it was a Friday morning and we wanted to stay in Montreal if at all possible, at least over\nthe Sabbath and we asked him, so he said no, that can't be done, because we have strict orders from\nthe Canadian government, that all the refugees, greenhorns, they are called at that time, greenhorns,\nI don't know from where the name greenhorn comes. Maybe green as the _is green. So what\nhappened? So the greenhorns have first to be, have, cannot stay where they want to stay, they must\ngo to their destination, because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take\ncare of them and the government will not take care of them, the Canadian government did not want\nto take care of them, they just wanted them out as much as possible, because Canada was not so\nfriendly to the greenhorns, because I know about internment camps in Canada, where people from\nEngland were sent to and stayed there for many years. Okay, so my father and we, and we children,\nall left and he brought us to a small restaurant and we had breakfast there and then he brought us to\nthe train station. Now the train in Canada at that time was a Canadian Pacific Train, railroad\ncompany I think it was and it was a small shack, I wouldn't call it more than a shack. It was a small\nshack and it was in June, on June 15th and it was very hot in Canada, we never had such heat before\nin Germany, was very hot and winter's very cold, summer's very hot. And we were sitting there and\nhe, I don't know if he gave us a ticket, or somehow we stayed there, it was about 10 o'clock in the\nmorning. So we thought of how, what can we do in order to remain in Montreal, so we remembered\none thing, that we had written to relatives in Montreal, my father had a cousin from\nEkatarinaslav(ph) in Russia, who was a tailor and who had moved to Montreal and we had written\nthem, but the letter had come back to Germany, addressee not found. So we said, maybe he's, he's\nstill living there, my father said and he was sure that he was still living. Maybe we can find out, but\nhow can we find out? So about 10:30 I think it was, there was a desk in the train station and two\nnuns came in, because Canada, Quebec is Catholic, you see and two nuns came in and they put on a\nlight and the light said, traveler's aid. So my father said, \"Maybe these nuns can find out if this\nfamily's still living here.\" So he went over to the nuns, but the nuns didn't speak English and we\ndidn't speak French. So what language are you speaking in. So they knew Russian, my father\nspoke Russian to them and he told them that we think there is a family living here, if they knew that\nwe would be here, they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown(ph),\nSaskatchewan. So the nuns said, but what's their name? Said Kaplan. There are many Kaplans,\ncome to find out, Caplan with a C, Kaplan with a K. What's the first name? Burr(ph) Kaplan.\nWhat's his profession? He was a tailor. What's his mother's, his wife's name? Bebe(ph), I think.\nSo they came and they took the telephone book I think, or address book that they had at that time\nand they went through it and they called up all these people and they called up and people came to\nthe the phone and they said, no, I'm not from Ekatarinaslav(ph), I'm not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera.\nSo they called up 15, 16 people, then they called up someone and there came a young boy at that\ntime, of my age, from the phone and he said, I don't know, but I'll call my mother, so he called his\nmother, his mother says, \"Yes, my husband's name is Burr(ph), he's a tailor, he came from\nEkatarinaslav(ph), what are you calling about?\" They said, \"There are some people who are claim\nyou are relatives and they want to talk to you.\" Okay, so made my father talk to them and my father\nright away recognized him, he seen him, he, not he, his wife, they hadn't seen each other for, at that\ntime I mean, 15, 20 years and she said, \"What? You're here? I have a son who is a pharmacist, his\nname is Jackie, so I call him and have come right over and we take you into our house.\" So we\nwaited about 15 or 20 minutes and then he came and he came and he took us all and we went to, we\nwent to the Kaplan's and we stayed there for a few days and in the mean time we did not go to, to\nCanada. But, what happened was this, in the mean time, about 11 o'clock, we had received a\ntelegram, I don't know how it came to us, it came to the JIAS, probably, because the JIAS had sent\nthem a telegram that your refugee, your family is here and we are going to send them right on to\nyou, so they had sent a telegram, Western Union, I still have the certificate and they said to them,\n\"Stay where you are, we cannot support you here because we had droughts for several years.\" They\nwere farmers and I was supposed to be a farmer and the young fellow at that time, who was about\nmy age, I would be his farmer, you see and I never had seen the family, just recently, last year only,\nI met him. Now he is 72 years old. At that time he was 20. So what happened 1s, stay there. So he\nsaid to us, the man from the JIAS said to us, that doesn't matter because he promised to let you stay\nthere and the Canadian government made us promise them that we will send them all back there, but\nthis is ___s = how we stayed there, through America, because the ___ out about it. _I don't know\nwhat happened to the tickets, but we stayed there, so we stayed in Montreal.",
        "A: Yeah, see it came by mail and the mail said, not found. In Germany they say Unbekund(ph), not\nknowing thing. And I only remember this because my mother had shown them to me and my father\nwas sure that they were still there, but he didn't know where they were and if they were still alive\nand if they were living there, but that was of course, at that time.",
        "A: Yeah. So we were living there for a few days and then they got us an apartment, not an\napartment, a room, I think for 18 dollars a month, a month and it was a shaky room, but anyhow we\nwere staying at and in the mean time, to get settled there, we needed a job and other things like this.\nMy brother got a job right away. My brother got a job in a hardware store because and because he\nworked with toys and he invented certain toys at that time, you see. He got a job right away. My\nsister, was very hard for her to get a job, so she kept the house for us for the time being and my\nyounger brother went to school there or something like this and my father, who was a bicycle\nmechanic couldn't find a job here and I couldn't find a job here, but, but somehow there was an\nemployment agency, the Baron de Hirsch(ph) Institute in, in there and I got a job, we got a job the\nfirst time, I got a job to bring flowers, like carrying flowers, bring, like a messenger. Bring flowers\nfrom here to here. Second time I got a job in a kind of a bicycle store to clean up the cellar, they\nhad had a fire, but they had a fire after us too, so we had to leave again, I don't know. How much\ndid they pay, they paid one dollar a day, one Canadian dollar a day, that was a lot of money then.\nThen finally I got a job in a chicken factory, not chicken factory, chicken business and I didn't like\nthe smell, didn't want to go there. Besides this, at that time, they wanted you to work every day and\nI didn't want to work on the Shabbat, __ want, couldn't get the job. Then I went again to, there\nwas a Jewish newspaper in Montreal which was called The Eagle, the Atler(ph). I went to this place\nand they would put an ad into their paper, but they told us, why don't you see Mr. Bromfman(ph),\nyou know this Bromfman(ph), the father of this Mr. Bromfman(ph). He has a Seagram company,\nthe year, big, what's it called, liquor company, whiskey company. Go to Mr. Bromfman(ph), so we\ntook a long, a long trip by bus and we came to Mr. Bromfman(ph) and we told him and they told\nhim that there are refugees and they have a job and so he said he has no job, but he was also, he was\nalso the owner of The Eagle, he was also the owner of The Eagle, so we didn't get a job from him,\nhowever, I went back to the Baron de Hirsch(ph) Institute and they told me they found a job for me\nin Saskatoon. Saskatoon is in Saskatchewan. Very good paying job, 15 dollars a week. That was\nvery much because what most people, 10 dollars a week was the average. So I went to, I said to\nthem, \"Okay, what do I have to do there?\" They said, \"You have to do this, and have to do that and\nyou have to be a man of everything, you have to be their hausen(ph) cantor(ph), you have to read\nthe Torah, you have to teach them, you have to do everything, for 15 dollars a week.\" I think I took\nit at that time, I said to them, \"I will, I will think it over\", but in fact I didn't want it. Then...",
        "A: First of all, it was too far out and was too many things to do and I wanted to stay in the big city, I\nwanted to stay in Montreal or some other big city.",
        "A: Yes. So what happened is, my father found, in Montreal, another cousin. His name was\nFevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph) and Fevel(ph) Pastillnik(ph), he was already a little bit older, not too old he\nwasn't, only like 50, 60 years old. So he came over to us and he said to me, \"You went to\nWurzburg, to the seminary, as a teacher, you see and you were in __, go to the United States.\nThat's the only, because in Canada there isn't much Yiddishgad(ph),\" Jewishness, \"you go United\nStates.\" And at that time, just at that time, they closed it. Up to that time students could come very\neasily to the United States, but it was closed in 1938 or 1939, that you needed more than just this,\nyou needed a reason, other things. So, I didn't think much of it and I said, \"What can you do?\" But\none day he called us up, this Fevel(ph) and said, \"I saw in a Jewish paper, there was a Yiddish\npaper, written in Yiddish, it's for the Americana, the American and it said on the front page of this,\"\nunfortunately I don't have that paper any more, I hadit for _\u2014_\u2014.:~'\"On the front page of this paper\nis a big picture of refugees, who came to Baltimore and some of them came from Wurzburg\", from\nwhere I had studied, and he said he wants to show it to me and if I recognized any of them. I had no\ninterest in that, but I said to myself, \"What can you lose? Go to him and look at it.\". So I went to\nhim one day, it was in August, I think it was in August and, and he showed me the picture and I\nrecognized a few people on these pictures, I recognized them. Besides this I read the article and it\nmentioned a certain Kalibar(ph), Rabbi Kalibar(ph), not that Kalibar(ph), related to them. And he\nsaid to me what I do is, what I should do is, I should write to this yeshiva(ph) near Israel\nCollege in Baltimore, it's still existing. And I should tell them about this and see what's happening.\nSo I wrote to them, it's in here, and I got an answer right away and the answer said, \"We will accept\nyou. We will accept you. We will give you an affidavit and just come in. Go to the Consul and\nhave it verified.\" Now at that time, to get permission to go from Canada to Britain ...",
        "A: To the United States, was the Consul in Montreal, the American Consul in Montreal, he had the\nfinal say, not the Justice Department, they didn't have a Justice Department yet, the Naturalization\nDepartment yet, that was only instituted later. But go to the American Consul in Montreal. I went\nto the Consul and it was a very nice man, it was a British man, because at that time, Canada was not\nit's own country, 1t was a dominion, British dominion.",
        "A: Yeah, actually, it was a British dominion, it said here, a commonwealth, but it only became a\ncountry by itself in 1942. Then it was independent of Britain, but at that time it was still dependent\non Britain. So I said to the Consul, I told them my story and he was very receiving, accepting it and\nhe said to me, \"But you don't have a valid passport, number one, number two, it's not so easy for\nstudents to get to the United States now, number two, you don't have citizenship at all, you are not\neven a Canadian domiciled person, because you lived here less than six months, because we came in\nJune 15th and this was August. You lived here less than... and you only gained citizenship,\ndomicile in Canada, after six months, so you are not domiciled person, so I cannot let you go.\" I\nsaid, \"But I promise that I will come back, because my family is here.\" He said, \"Still.\" So he said,\n\"I will do something special,\" he said. \"I will call my consul together and discuss it with them and\nthen you come before this consul and they can make a decision.\" So he made a, he called his people\ntogether, I don't know who was his high officials and I talked to them about the story and they said\nto me, finally and they, and they sent me out and then they called me back and said, \"We made a\ndecision, we made a decision that we will let you go, as a student, until February, because you're,\nthat means 60 days before your passport expires. Your passport expires in April 21st, we will let\nyou go until February 21st, under the condition that when you come to Montreal, when you come to\nBaltimore, you will have your passport extended by the Germans.\" I said okay. So I made the\narrangements, and so I had the permission here now to go to Canada, to go to Baltimore, however,\nhow will I get there? So I went again to the JIAS and I had no money and the JIAS gave me 30\ndollars, I think. That was the amount of the trip. I went with Greyhound bus from Montreal to\nBaltimore.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: In Europe, especially in Germany and all the countries, you have the citizenship of your father.\nMy father was born in Russia and he was a Russian citizen at one time. However, in, shortly before\nthe first World War I think, he came over to the, he came over to Germany, to Breslau and to other\ncities in Germany and he stayed there and he got married in Bremen, 1916 he got married and then\nhe stayed there and he had, he was working and he had his own bicycle business and motorcycle\nbusiness. And then in 1921, 1922, 1923, when Russia became Soviet Republic and they made it\nlaw, I think in 1933 was the final law, that anyone who left Russia before it became the Soviet\nRepublic, has to return in order to retain his citizenship and my father didn't want to return to, to\nRussia, because he just escaped because in the very beginning of the century, they would capture\nthe Jewish children and let them work for 25 years in the army, cantoons(ph) they were called. So\nhe didn't want to return, so he lost his citizen, he became stateless.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My, all my family is stateless. Only if you buy the German citizenship, because there was a\ntime, at the end of the 1920's that you could buy the German citizenship for 50 marks and they came\nmany times to my father's store and said buy, become a German, but my father said no. Germany is\nthe source of all anti-Semitism, I don't want to be and it was good, because afterwards they took it\naway from them anyhow. So he never bought German citizenship. He remained stateless all his\nlife and when we came to Canada, they became Canadian citizen, not I and when we came to\nAmerica, I became American citizen.",
        "A: Yeah but there, before I arrived in Baltimore, there's something else. I, all right, when we came\nto the border, to the American border, they examined all my luggage and I had Tosefa Torah, which\nI spoke to you before, with me. They didn't know what it was, but I explained it to them. So we\ncame then, to New York, first we come from, we stopped in New York and we stopped in New\nYork in the middle of the night, 11, 12 o'clock at night. And my father had told me that he had a\nfriend in New York, Eiseman(ph), whom he had once saved in Germany, he was in the prison and\nhe had given him an affidavit and he was able to leave Germany and he went to the United States\nalready, in the 20's. And he had sent us an affidavit at that time, we could have gone to United\nStates in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go because she had all the relatives in Germany. So\nwe missed up on that opportunity. But when I came to New York, I said, \"I'm going to call up this\nperson.\" I didn't know very much about New York, we, we, at the Madison Square Garden, I think,\nwe, there was a Greyhound station. So I called him up in the middle of the night, of course, I didn't\nknow very much. So then I said I have to wait until the morning. Then in the morning I called up\nagain, six or seven o'clock now and at that time they didn't, not everyone had a telephone, there was\nprobably one telephone for the whole apartment house and people had to be called and come down\nto that place. It's a little bit of history. So I call them and I said, \"Is there a Mr. Eiseman(ph) living\nin this building?\" and the woman said, \"Yes, yes there are, I'll call him, I'll call him.\" And he came\ndown to the phone and he heard me and when he heard me, he said, \"Where are you? You are\ngoing to stay here for a few days, I want you to stay here for a few days\" and he will come and see\nme. \"So where do you live?\" This Mr. Eiseman(ph) lived in Brooklyn and I was in Manhattan and\nI didn't know the distances here, I thought maybe in half an hour he can come over, he said, \"No, it\ntakes me at least two and a half hours.\" Long distances. And it was 1939, they had the World's Fair\nin New York at that time, I don't know if you remember. So he said and he wants to show me the\nWorld's Fair. So I waited there in the Greyhound station and finally he came over, his wife was\nhome, I think and his daughter, they came and they came and they picked me up at 10 o'clock or so\nand we went to a kosher restaurant there and then he took me to the __ and _I stayed with him\nmaybe at least overnight, one night, I don't remember any more how long and then next morning, I\ncontinued to Baltimore.",
        "A: In New York.",
        "A: Yes. And I forgot to tell you something. When I, when we came to, when we came to Montreal,\nI forgot to tell you something. At that time I was still, in Jewish they call it the year of mourning,\none year of mourning after a parent dies or \u2014_\u2014__..._:I_was still in the year of mourning after my\nmother. I came there, we came there in June, 1939, my mother had been killed in November, 1938\nand I went to the synagogue to say Kaddish and I came to the synagogue and I wanted to say a\ncertain prayer which we usually say if someone is saved from a danger, they say a certain prayer,\nwhich is called Gomelbenchen(ph), you see and there were all people there and they said, \"You\ndon't have to say that.\" I said, \"Why not?\" \"It's not so bad in Germany.\" Because, I could not\nunderstand, as I was completely disappointed, that the people here in, in Canada and in the United\nStates, did not think it was as bad as it really was, because I don't know from where they got their\ninformation, because these people, these old men who were there and didn't want me to say it, I said\nit anyhow. All right, they were not religious, that's one thing, but they did not believe that it was\nthat bad in Germany and that it was America that we were saved, we were far away from Germany\nnow. I could not believe it. And then in America also, they enjoyed thems...\n[end of side one, tape two]",
        "A: So I couldn't understand the people in America and Canada, they were enjoying themselves,\nwere having a good time, and that they did not want to believe, or did not believe that it was so bad\nin Germany.",
        "A: I was disappointed, because I, I, I saw everything, like miracles happened here, that I had come\nout, we had come out, that we found relatives, that I was able to go to Baltimore. They were all\nmiracles, because I never thought of that.",
        "A: Yes, I think they did not feel with the people in Germany. I mean, it was quite different in\nAmerica at that time, even though America is nowadays probably the best country to live in in the\nwhole world, but it seemed to me at that time at least, that it was more a detached kind of\nrelationship, that the people had with each other and not a kind of very close kinship relationship.\nBecause everything went like automatically. Business-like, more business-like. And we have, in\nour family, I mean they're talking about, about family life, but we had more a family kind of\nrelationship, not only with the family, but with other people, too. The people who came from\nEurope still had this kind of relationship, to a certain extent.",
        "A: Whoever wanted to know, I told them. I told the British Consul in Amer, in Montreal and I told\nafter that, the Canadian Consul, the British Consul in Baltimore, I told, also spoke about this, I\ntalked about this and these people be more interested in knowing about it. But the people who\nreally should know about it, you see, they're not so much interested in this.",
        "A: I knew that, that first of all, religion was completely different in the United States and Canada\nthan it was in Europe or especially in my section, even though in Germany, many of them or most\nof them are not religious, you see. But here it was also different, as I said, it was more, how do you\ncall it, stylish. That means, organized and not so, what we call in Yiddish, Haemish(ph),\nHaemish(ph) means having a close bond relationship, okay? My relatives, I mean my father's\nrelatives, the Kaplans, you see, were very, were very friendly and they had ___ this kind of\nrelationship, a warm relationship. But in other circles, it was just to a certain point, as I said before,\nwhen I went the synagogue and I saw these people there, they more or less were for themselves,\nmore or less. They didn't care so much about what was going on anywhere in the world at that time.\nAnd I think that was also one of the reasons why the United States didn't recognize what happened\nin Germany until much later and Roosevelt had a hard time to convince them to, to do something\nabout it, the War Relief Fund and so, they came all much later. I hope it's not true, but that was true\nat that time.",
        "A: While I was in, while I was in Baltimore, let's say, I wrote to relatives in Germany and I got a\nfew answers, but all these answers were censored, because all the letters came back with censored\nby so and so and so and so. And in the end, I didn't hear anything any more at all. And some\npeople in Germany gave me pictures, I should do something about it, but I couldn't even do\nanything about myself.",
        "A: I knew that bad things were happening there and I knew it from some people, again from my\norganization, Agoutis(ph) Israel, because when I was in Baltimore there was one man, who came\nevery week from Washington and he had cousins there, he was my roommate, next door roommate\nyou see, came every Thursday to go back to what, he came from New York, excuse me, not from\nWashington, he came from New York and stopped over in Baltimore and went to Washington to do\nsomething about it. And he had very much information. So I knew that what, that what was going\non, that it was not good and he was working in it, in this organization very much. I knew things\nwere not good. But I knew, the way the letters came to me from Germany, from the, indirectly, I\nknew what was happening there. And they'd all try, instance, so and so is on vacation. That meant\nhe was in the concentration camp. Or when they wrote for instance, we had to change, that means\nthat they displaced them and sent them to another place, you see. I think once I sent a 20 dollar\nmark, which I had just how some __, I never heard of again, it was against the law, I sent it in an\nenvelope. 20 mark wasn't really so much, but still.",
        "A: No, I, there were two things, or three things. Number one, I wanted to see if I could not get\nanyone out, but I had no money and the organization had very much trouble here, even in the United\nStates, because they didn't want to be involved. America got only involved in 1941 and the thing is,\nand, and, but everyone, every refugee, the refugees, they adored Roosevelt. Later on they found out\nhe wasn't that, not 100 percent, because whenever he got something to talk about the Jews in this\nconference, you see, he put it on the bottom, he didn't talk to 1t very much. But on the other end,\nthey didn't have anyone else to adore, so they adored him, pretty much and they thought he would\nsave it in the end. I don't have to talk about history. But when I wrote a poem I came here, you see.\nI was very much in favor of the United States and I thought it was the only country, you see, where\nwe could be able to do anything. Hm? It's the land of the future, you see, okay?",
        "A: I only want to read the last two paragraphs over here.",
        "A: When I came to the United States.",
        "A: Or when I came to Canada, but it's too long, I only want to say, it ends like this, \"Land of future,\nour future. Everything we bring to you, seeking refuge we are coming, that is all we have in view.\nTo be treated in this country, __ rights, like you, the same. Not despised, disdained, detested.\nThat's our truly, that is our honest aim. Continent of mankind's future, world of sun and hope. Far\noff war and things of fight, on the western semi-globe. God bless you. From a land of terror, we\nwere forced to flee. God bless you America, you're the land of the free. That's on, at the end of our\nwhole voyage to America, you see.",
        "A: As I said, my mother never wanted to leave Germany, all the Jews in Germany, loved Germany\nvery much, it's a beautiful country and we traveled around there and it has nice sights and nice\nscenes and nice countrysides, but we saw there was no future in Germany. Not only was there no\nfuture, you would, you would be killed in Germany. So we left and we were leaving, just with the\nintention to find a better place, as I said here and to have more opportunity because there was no\nopportunity left.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was one thing, yes. But, but the further away we came from Germany, the more we thought\nabout new opportunities. And of course we were sorry and sad for those people who couldn't come\nout and who we had left behind. But we couldn't think of very much because now we had to be on\nour own and make our own. Some people left with money, very early in the 30's, but we left with\nno money, four dollars.",
        "A: Then we came to Baltimore and I arrived in Baltimore and I called up the college, I called up the\ncollege and they were very friendly, they said, \"Take a taxi and we'll pay for that,\" and the taxi\nbrought me through Baltimore. It was a very long trip, I never was in such a big city, because\nBremen, where I come from, is a much smaller city, you see. So I came there and they greeted me\nwhen I came in and they were very happy and I was happy to come there. So I came there, I met\nsome people whom I had seen before, especially this Rabbi Kalibar(ph) I met and many others and\nalso the one who was the executive director, he's still there now. I also had met in Germany, maybe\nhis relatives, not him. So it was different, so I very quickly got adjusted to it, they gave me a room\nyou see, with two, two other roommates. It was on Garrison Boulevard in Baltimore. And I started\nlearning there.",
        "A: They were, they were all kinds, they were mostly Americans, but there also some people who\nhad learned in Europe, in Poland and Russia and there were some people who were of German\norigin.",
        "A: Not at that time, however, I saw in the newspaper, which they showed me, and I might have met\nthem afterwards, I don't remember, they also were brought over by, by the college from Germany\nand _ in the newspaper. My name was also in the newspaper that I'm someone else from\nStrasbourg. Then there was the Rabbi Schwab(ph), who recently passed away, he also came from\nGermany and I knew him from there and there were a few people of German origin.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Then I was learning and I became a teacher, a principal.",
        "A: It was in the education field, mainly.",
        "A: Yeah. But then I decided I want more in the educational field than being a rabbi and later on I\nwas also mainly in the educational field. Social work and so forth.",
        "A: Yeah, I was at one time, I had a job in Mountaindale(ph), New York and in New York, assistant\nrabbi and that was probably mainly it.",
        "A: Yeah, different congregations in New York, but they were much later. Because I stayed in\nBaltimore from 1939 to 1945 and in 1944, I was ordained as a rabbi and I learned there many years,\nwith many other people and during the war, I can tell you, during the war, even in the United States,\nI was considered an alien, what do they call it? Enemy alien and I had to get permission to go from\nBaltimore to New York, each time, from the Attorney General, it was a woman, I went to her many\ntimes, put a stamp in the passport or so, something like this, gave me a special card. When I\ntraveled from Baltimore to Yonkers, near New York, I also needed special permission. And I\nneeded every year, an extension of my passport. So now that comes to this point. All right, they\nhad told me in Montreal, when you come there, get your passport extended, yeah? I go, I'm there.\nSo I said to myself, who can extend it, it was made out by the German government, go to the\nGerman consulate. At that time, 1939, yeah, Canada entered the war, I left, I left Canada on the\nfifth or sixth of September, Canada entered the war at, on the seventh of September, September, day\nafter. So I came there, the German consulate, at that time, America was not at war yet, so the\nGermans still had the consulate here. But I had no money to go there because it was 15 cents\nalready at that time, a bus in Washington, Baltimore. In New York was five cents a subway. So I\ngot the money, I went to the consul and I said to myself, \"I have to be very careful when I go to\nthese people.\" So I went up there. So they, so it was lunchtime. I didn't know that they have\nlunchtime in America and that there is such long lunchtime and they go out and no one 1s there. But\nthere was someone there, so I said to him I wanted my passport extended if they can extend it. They\nsaid, \"Yes, leave the passport with us.\" I said to myself, \"No, I don't leave anything here.\" I take it\nwith me and said, \"I come back another time.\" I never came back. I went to the Canadian consul,\nbecause I came from Canada and I said to him, \"I cannot get this passport extended, but I only have\npermission here until February 21st, so if he cannot get permission for me, extension of the\npassport.\" So he said to me, you see, and this is interesting that he made a mistake and that saved\nme. He said to me, about, he did not ask me about domicile, he just said I came from Canada and\nhe gave me permission to stay until June. Did he give me permission? Then I had no more\npermission and he said he cannot give me permission any more because I wasn't in Canada and he\nhas no longer authority to do this. So I go to Washington and I told them, \"I came here on this\npassport that cannot be extended and I'm studying, I came here as a student and I cannot return to\nCanada because I didn't gain domicile and I cannot return to Germany because they are at war\" and\nif I can stay here longer. So he gave me, Washington gave me permission for one more year and\nthey waived my passport requirements and every year, only every year I had to write to them for\nanother year extension and that I did until the end of the war. And then at the end of the war, I\nmade a, during the war I made a request to become a citizen. It was 1943, but I couldn't become a\ncitizen at that time because it was the height of the war, Stalingrad. He said, \"Did you do anything\nfor the war effort?\" So what could I do, I wasn't in the army, but I bought war bonds, but that wasn't\nenough, so they said, \"No, you cannot become a citizen now, but after six months, you can reapply.\"\nSo I reapplied again after six months and the situation got better, then I got the FBI to help me and\nfinally, in 1945, I got what's called first papers. At that time there were first papers and second\npapers, now you can right away become a citizen. Anyhow I had to wait five years in between and\nthen in 1951, I became a citizen. When I became a citizen, I changed my name. Why did I change\nmy name? First of all, my wife didn't like this name, in the meantime I got married, 1948, so.",
        "A: New York I got married, because I didn't tell you that after Baltimore, I went to New York. So I\nsaid, this is a Russian name and people cannot pronounce it and I cut off the beginning and the head\nand the tail, like, like a herring and I keep the middle. The middle is Wein and I don't like one\nname, one syllable names, so make it Weiner, so they make my name Weiner. It's in my\nnaturalization papers. During the war, I tried to do many things. I tried to be and I was even, air\nraid warden too, at one time, but then they told me, you are an enemy alien, you cannot be an air\nraid warden, so okay, I said okay, ____. ~ During the war, I also went to night school to learn\nEnglish and I had a very famous governor of Maryland, who was a teacher, McKelton(ph), I don't\nknow if you heard of him. He was a tall man and he used to say a word, he said, \"Winners are never\nquitters, quitters are never winners. So go on with what you want to do, don't quit. If you quit, you\ncannot win. Winners are never quitters, quitters are never winners.\" So I liked that and many other\nstory, but that's not about this. So I stayed in Baltimore and then in 1944 when I got ordination,\n_______, [had many friends there, I met other people too. I was working also with the Agoutis(ph)\nHistoric movement there and I, groups of children and to others and I send children to camps in\nsummer and so forth, I did this all there and I instituted something in Baltimore, three things I\ninstituted there because I thought, it is in the American heir that they are a little bit, so big, at least it\nwas at that time, to be a little bit more distant. So I wanted the people in the Yeshiva to be a little bit\ncloser, so I arranged something, they had only a loan fund, so I said, There are some people who\ncannot pay back a loan, we make it the charity fund and give out forthwith, money.\" Number two, I\nmade arrangements with the doctors who would give free service to the Yeshiva boys. Number\nthree, I arranged with some people to give clothing, free clothing, at that time people took second-\nhand clothing, today they don't take it any more. Number four, I arranged in the morning to wake\nthem up, Iran through those \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ Number five, I instituted a fund for medicines, because at that\ntime everyone had to buy medicine, no one could do it. I said, if you join this club for 10 cents a\nmonth, 10 cents, we give you aspirin or whatever you need and Number five, Number six, I institute\nsomething on the end of Shabbat, to make, to invite certain number of people and to have them give\na little talk and since we invited only certain kinds of people, only, we invited only certain numbers,\nso everyone wanted to be invited, so they came around. And I'm still friends with some of these\npeople who took over, one of them is now in Philadelphia, Rabbi Rosh Hasheva(ph) and |\ntoo, a good friend of his.",
        "A: It was probably here, but not to that extent.",
        "A: Yeah, they were very much successful there. Okay, now, what comes now, after the war?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: All right, first I got a job in Yonkers, through, also is through a friend of mine in Baltimore and\nit, that was like a teacher, principal and a little bit of a rabbi, because they haven't, they hadn't had,\nno, wait a second, _, no, yes, Yonkers was an orphan home. At that time they called it orphan\nhome, now they call it child care agency and this orphan home in Yonkers, there were about 200\nyoungsters of all ages, from six to 18 and I was put in charge of the people in between, between 10\nand 13 and most of them were children who, where the parents had sent them over from Europe\nand, in to give them safety and then the parents would come over later. I still know some of the\nchildren there. And I was giving them services every day and so to say like social work,\npsychology and things of this sort, that was in Yonkers. In Yonkers I earned, how much was it, I\nthink 100 dollars a month, but they gave me also, free food, you see and lodging and the person in\ncharge was not Jewish, but he was a very nice person. I remember him. Then I found an ad in a\nJewish paper that they needed a teacher and principal and rabbi-like, in Mountaindale(ph), then\ncome to my job in Mountaindale(ph), they had a number of people who applied for this, but I was, I\nwas selected and I stayed in Mountaindale(ph), it's in the Catskill Mountains, and I met very\ninteresting people there and after two years I said I don't want to stay there any more. First of all,\nthese small communities, they wanted a change of face. After two years, it's too long for them and I\nalso wanted a change. Then, I got a job in Newark, New Jersey...\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: Okay, after Mountaindale(ph), I had a job in Newark, 1n fact I had a few jobs in Newark, in the\nmorning and the afternoon in the Yeshiva and in the afternoon school.",
        "A: Teaching. Then I gotajob with ___ of teacher's seminary in Brooklyn and I was so to say, in\ncharge of the office and I also gave some courses in psychology and so forth. And besides this, I\nworked in, I worked in Brooklyn at the teacher's seminary, also, with the State Department to bring\nover girls from Sweden and they brought over about 500 girls from Sweden, who were stranded\nthere after the war. Sweden was neutral during the war. Finally, I also had ajob inthe _ in the\nafternoon and I also had a job in the business as an office manager, first in the burlap company and\nafterwards in a shipping company and finally I decided to get one job, so I heard something about\nthe city of New York, they needed social workers and I had gone to school here at the teacher's\ncollege, I got a degree from teacher's college and I became a Social Worker in the Department of\nWelfare at that time. Afterwards called the Department of Social Services and I started with them\nin 1956, I just jump over a little few things that are not so important and from 1956 on, I was with\nthe Department of Social Services for 31 years, until 1987. I had all kinds of jobs in the Department\nof Social Services, starting from social worker, to Supervisor one, Supervisor two, Supervisor three,\nAssistant Director, training division, foster care and adoption, child abuse and child neglect, all\nkinds of things and I also wrote certain papers and certain articles for the, for the Department of\nSocial Services. I wrote a book about how to get grants and, I don't even remember any more, I\nwrote a lot of things for them. And I was in different offices, I was in offices in Brooklyn and\nBronx, in New York, until then, finally I retired, in 1987. After I retired, that means 31 years, I just\nskip over it, then in 1987, I joined the, what's it called, the Jewish Education Society in New York\nand I was giving talks to different groups. Then I joined, the seniors too, I gave groups to senior\ngroups all over the New York and Coney Island, Brooklyn and all over. In family and family\ncounseling service, it was in the family counseling service of that department, that talked to families\nand you gave also individual counseling and I worked to the Training Institute for Psychologists in\nNew York and then in 1987, 1988, we decided to move from New York. I wanted to move at a\ntime when I can still walk on my two feet, before I get too old and we moved to Silver Spring. We\nhave three children who were born, 1949, 1951 and 1953, a son and two daughters. My son is an\nactuary(ph), the other daughter used to be a journalist and the third daughter is a mathematician and\nstatistician. Especially my son and younger daughter are very good mathematicians, they made the\nhighest score in the tests, in the Regent's Tests, I think it were called. But I started to work also\nbeside this, with different organizations, writing stories for children or writing articles, or giving\ntalks or learning Jewish subjects and I still do this, I recently gave a talk on, on __\u2018 Therapy, by\nVictor Frankel(ph), I gave this many times here, in the JCC, Jewish Community Counsel and I also\ngave it in other places and it was very well attended and I gave other courses, you know, on Jewish\nsubjects. And now, coming to today, I'm still giving courses here and there, one week in this\nsynagogue, one week in that synagogue and during the week with individual people, people come to\nhear, from Montgomery County, from __, from Baltimore, from all kinds of places. And I'm\nstill writing and trouble is, I have written many, I have written many of these things in __,, that\nmeans in certain parts and now when I want to write the whole story, I have to integrate it, it's not\nalways easy. But I hope one day it will come out complete. I always think about more, so I can\nnever finish.",
        "A: Because I, for two or three reasons, number one, I'm interested in education and in learning\nmore, like the perennial student, who always wants to learn more and I study a lot, with books and\nother things and I wanted to bring the people closer together. And, family life and, it's much easier,\nI wrote in my book too, it's much easier to learn how to hate than to love and then to be together and\nI know, there's so much, so many bad things happening in the world, with drugs, with crimes, all\nkinds of things, but we have to get in positive outlook to everyone, we have to do something which\nis positive, which helps to advance. Hate only brings you down and you have to bring something\nout, you see, which advances you, brings you closer together. I like to know people and what kind\nof life they have and what kind of life they made for themselves. And when I gave them advice, I\nalways gave them advice to do something positive. I even tell them, if they are not successful in\none subject, not to stay with it, to go into another one. I had a typist once who didn't know how to\ntype, so I helped him into another job. See, if you just let them go and you don't show any concern\nfor it, it doesn't cause for good relationship.",
        "A: First of all, I saw the relationship in my home and also with my family and I saw also with other\npeople that if they were close together, 1t was more successful and more helpful to them than if they\nwere separate or hating each other or doing something which was negative. I don't really know\nanything else, it must be in the genes of a person, you see, to do certain things, I don't know.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm. When I left the school, the German school, I went to a German school until 1936, the\nteacher asked us to write down what we want to do after school and why we want to do it after\nschool. So there were two things which interest me, number one, I figured out if I would stay in\nGermany, what would be possible, what would be open to me? There was nothing opened to me,\nnot in the non-German world, only in the Jewish world. So I decided to go to the Jewish teacher's\nseminary. In fact my teacher helped me select that. __|_ number one. Number two was, I saw\nmany people suffering in Germany, Jews especially and, so I thought I wanted to help them\nsomehow. Because they have, they have the same fate, they have the same fate that we have.\nThat's what I think it 1s, it might be more, but at this moment I cannot think of anything more. I\nmight come to think of more.",
        "A: Before we moved over here, we had to make a decision when we want to move and where we\nwant to move to. When we want to move to I already told you, I wanted to move when we are, still\ncan work and do something. I did not want to retire completely. When I gave my retirement speech\nin the Department of Social Services, I said to them, \"Retire means to put on a new tire, to put on a\nnew career. Retirement means a new career and people in their retirement usually are more busy\nthan before.\" Where we want to move to. So my son, who lives in New York state, I didn't want to\nmove there, because they have a lot of business to do with themselves, they have their own family\nand they wouldn't have any time for us, not that I want people to have time for me, but they're busy\nwith themselves. The second reason I didn't want to move there is, there wouldn't be any chance for\nme to do something else, to get a job for something else. Cleveland, my daughter lives in\nCleveland. I didn't want to move there, the Cleveland climate is too cold. So we moved here.\nThat's our youngest daughter, she is here, living here and I think we could give her some help and\nalso here would be the possibility to get another job and I got some other jobs here.",
        "A: Do mean that originally why we wanted to come to the United ...",
        "A: What was most difficult to adjust to?",
        "A: First of all, there were already in America at that time when we came here, there were already\ngroups of equally minded, equal minded Jews, were already living here. There were already\ncongregations, certain places and therefore it made it easier for me and therefore I might be able to\nfind a job through them and I did. And there is more possibility and opportunity here than other\nplaces. It was not as hard, as difficult to find connections, see and to study and learn something.",
        "A: No, well, not too difficult here.\nwas the McCarthy hearings or the Civil Rights movement or even the Japanese internment centers, I\nmean were there events here that you had a particular, particularly strong reaction to?",
        "A: Yeah, for instance, as I mentioned before, during the war...",
        "A: Yeah. During the war, that we were considered enemy aliens, despite the fact that we were\nsaving, they were not, they did not make a differentiation between those who came here because of\ntheir own personal persecution and those who were actually went along with the Nazi system. They\ndidn't make any difference here, they just considered everyone who came from Germany in the\nsame category, the Japanese too. That was one thing. And then, afterwards, I mean the McCarthy\nhearings and so forth, the un-American committee, see that it's not American again, not too much\nAmerican. I mean that was a, a leftover, I would say, from what the thinking was here in the\nbeginning of the 40's. Is means that they very much believed in, in pure American and anything\nwhich came from outside of America, like Russia, and the Communists and so forth, was\nconsidered, you cannot live with it and you have to fight it. So I think, but then the people\nunderstood that the most important here is actually to do something for the country, when Kennedy,\nwhen Kennedy came. I don't know if this is the right answer, there is no right answer to it.",
        "A: Okay. All right. At one point, at one point I could have gotten a job, I was even offered a job\nalready, in Portland Oregon, I was offered a job, in 19, 1956 and I got the contract in and everything\nlike this and I thought everything would be okay and I would be able to do this, to go there, to start a\nschool and certain other things and I discussed it with some of the friends here and some intelligent\npeople, if this is country that's reliable, if I can believe it and they said, \"Yes.\" But what happened\nis, I made already arrangements for the plane to go there and the condition was, my condition, that I\nwould go there for three months on trial and if I like it, I stay, if I don't, and fulfill the complete\ncontract, if not I would come back. But just the day before I was leaving, I was told that they\nchanged their mind there and they don't want to make a school there, they want to make some kind\nof a social program or who knows what there and I had already given up my job, which I had here.\nI had two jobs, I had the job in the Hebrew school and I had the job in the burlap factory. And\nfortunately, the burlap factory, they took me back right away, even though I had canceled with\nthem, the Jewish school did not take me back, but I didn't mind and the Portland, the one who had\nsigned the contract gave me 50 dollars, which was not very much for the whole contract, which they\nsigned, so then I decided, I'm not going into this field any more, because you cannot believe them\nand I wanted to go on something which was safer. Then I found out about the city of New York\nand I went into the Social Work System with the city of New York.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Because Kennedy, in his speech, especially the first speech we'd seen, don't do what the country\nwants from you, do what you can do for your country, you see, that people should work more for\neach other instead of against each other and always expecting things coming to them, you have to\nin, put some input, you have to do something and I wanted some input also, not all, that's why I\nwanted to make my own school and my this and all kinds of things. Some input, not just just on the\nreceiving end. This is unfortunately, naturally, people like to be served, but that's not how we can\nbuild up something. So that's just the kind of input, and when I came here, for instance, that\nsynagogue, they didn't have a certain class, so I instituted a class there. When I came here, they\ndidn't have a certain kind of information sheet, so I instituted an information sheet. When I came to\nWurzburg, they did not have a newsletter all the time, so we instituted a newsletter and ___ to the\n______ and we told them some stories about, I would like some input. Giving something see, more\ngiving than taking.",
        "A: Safe in what respect?",
        "A: You can never feel 100 percent safe, you can only, as an actual thing, you cannot be safe. In\nyour mind you can feel safe. You can say, I have done what I do, what I've wanted to do and I have\ndone this and that's how it will go, it will be, it will be. Things may change, things change all the\ntime. The only constant in this world is change. So it will constantly change and I don't think that\nanti-Semitism will ever stop. Because I see it, whether it's in Israel, whether it's all over, you see,\nthere are always people who are very self-centered and they want just what they want and they do\nwhatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people, hurting\nother people or harming or killing other people. So therefore, I can only feel safe in the way, what\nI'm doing. If you believe in a certain thing, you believe in this and then you feel safe.",
        "A: Vigilant? Only so certain respect. Let's say 1f someone is a very fanatic, it wouldn't help them.\nYou can only be, be vigilant in your own approach and what you are doing yourself, not vigilant in\nrespect to, in regard to other people, that will not help very much. Because one war brings upon\nanother war __, like it was in, in Germany. First the war of 1870 brought about the war of 1914,\nbrought about the war 1939 and so forth. So one war brings about another war, so to bring about\npeace you see, that's actually what our intent is, the intent. Everyone talks about peace, but no one\ndoes anything about it, like the weather. It doesn't happen in the world today. We have many\narenas of war and people talk about peace and it continues. In Israel, all over.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You cannot always think of the worst, you, you think something will happen you see, how much\nwill happen, I don't know and then you have to be guided, like I did, by some principal which is\nbasic, by some basic principal which you believe by. If someone has a belief, then he knows\nsomething, then he, then he, then he feels safe. If someone had religion, for instance, he says, this 1s\nwhat I can do, so much I can do and not more and the rest I may, I may leave up to God or someone\nelse. I can do only my best, what I can do and every person's limited, can only do certain thing. So\nI will try my best. But then you really have to try your best.",
        "A: I felt very bad about what was happening and I felt that something had to be done about it and\nthe question, who could do something about it and how can you help, but it 1s not up to one person,\nit has to be a group of people and before you change any person's, before you can change any\nperson, before you can ask any person to help you, he has to have in his mind that he wants to help,\nreally. So you have to find out what is in his mind, you know and by talking to them and how bad it\nis. Many people didn't believe it. And I see it many times, there are still people today who don't\nbelieve it. People only believe it if it hurts themself, if 1t hits themself, hits them or their family. So\ntherefore, I think the most important thing 1s education and therefore I was always 1n the educational\nfield, I wanted to be in the educational field, because the work education means to bring out\n____. Not revolution by force, but to bring it out for other person, every person has something\nunique in themself, which other person doesn't have and bring this out.",
        "A: It was a momentary victory, momentary, because...\n[end of side one, tape three]",
        "A: I think it helped me lot of times and I also think that it helped me, not to get too involved or too\nmuch engrossed in thinking that this is very good, it wouldn't change. There is still, there is still\nthings that will change and not that this is a final answer, like what they are doing now in Israel? I\ndon't think that will be the final answer. There's a progress going on, life 1s movement, it\ncontinuously moves. It was good at that time, for instance, that many people needed someplace to\nlive and this was provided. But, as they saw in German, that the most pious person cannot live in\npeace if the evil neighbor doesn't want it. That's what Goyter(ph) said, he was a great German poet.\nSo you have to live with others together and sometimes the others don't want peace.",
        "A: You see, in the beginning, as I mentioned, I only became more religious after my bar mitzvah,\neven though we kept chabiss(ph) to a certain extent and my mother kept kosher food, household, but\nin wasn't such a problem, you see, we didn't think of it so much, we thought it would always remain\nlike that. Because I had friends, non-Jewish friends, we playing together and we didn't think of, so\nmuch about it. Neither did they think so much about it, the difference between Jews and non-Jews,\nuntil the Nazis came and made it a policy, everyone has to think about it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I said the regular prayers you see, what we always say.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I know one thing, that, I was the first born in the family, you see and usually the first born, gets\nmore attention from the parents, like in my case and they sent me to a school of higher learning and\nthey gave me piano lessons training. Not my sister, she always complained about this and so, so in\norder to give them a kind of feeling you see, of a little bit more than someone else, because like\nhonoring your parents, you respect your older brothers and sisters. But I didn't take advantage of it.\nProbably it made me feel a little bit, a little better, I don't know, you see?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: As I said, no I didn't say it but...",
        "A: As you know, my wife doesn't want to have any connection any more with Germany and\n____. I say, there were certain things in Germany which were very nice, you see and we would,\nand I would like to see it, I would like, let's say, for instance, go back and see where I was born and\nwhere we used to live. In fact we once went to Germany, since, since we immigrated here, but that\nwas only one day, but I don't know what the German mind is now, but I remember one thing, that\nafter the war, our neighbor, non-Jewish neighbors, wrote to my father a lot and they and I still have\nthe letters, in German, that they were good friends and they are sorry for what happened in Germany\nand so forth and of course they wrote, also said, they suffered a lot, but that's not comparable to\nwhat the Jews suffered, because anyone else, even I tell most of the young people, too, anyone else\nwho suffered, if he would accept the Nazi policy, would not be persecuted any more, Jews were\npersecuted whether they did or not and it was a purpose, so therefore I'd like to know, what the\nGerman attitude is now. When they asked me this question in the museum, you see, how I feel, I\nask them how do you feel?",
        "A: No, not any more.",
        "A: It was only during the war that I dreamt about some people I knew and I didn't know what would\nhappen to them.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, because I met her when we were still in Germany, she did not remember this, but I did, do.\nBecause when I was in Germany and I was going to the Wurzberger school, to the seminary, at one\ntime, in the last year, 1938, beginning of 1938, they wanted a foreign language to be taught and the\nquestion was, do you want Spanish or French. The majority wanted Spanish. After the majority\nwanted Spanish, they asked, is there anyone who can teach Spanish. I had had correspondence with\nSpain, a friend of mine, so I knew a little bit of Spanish, so I said, I'll try to give a Spanish course.\nSo I was appointed the first Spanish teacher in Wurzburg. And in order to make it applicable and\nhave people join this course, I gave a sample lecture in a big auditorium and she was one of the\nstudents there. She didn't even know that. And then we met again when we came to America.",
        "A: No, there, and a few reasons for it, number one, first of all, people like to marry someone who,\nwith whom they can converse, I mean, who is on their level and maybe even intellectually,\nculturally and so forth and when I came to New York, my wife had an aunt there who knew this\nfamily, you see. In fact I knew some, I knew of a cousin of my wife's, whom I liked, but she was\nkilled in the Holocaust. And then one day when my wife came here, she made the contact and, so\nthat's, we had met before as I said, but not knowing it and that's how it came about.",
        "A: No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is\ntrue, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless\nsomeone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to Iran, or go to other\nplace and marry there, but usually they try to find someone. Also I liked her family and the family\ngave me some, something, yeah, helped.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Not the way in which the German government operated at that time. Because in the 20's, when\nthey wanted to establish a democracy in Germany, ___ a democracy, most people were not in\nfavor of this democracy, or they didn't care and therefore, one government after the other fell. That\nwas one thing. Number two was, the Treaty of Versailles, in 1918, 1919, did not intend to create a\nUnited Nations, or what we have now, in the League of Nations. They did not want to, they did not\nwant to bring people closer, but they wanted to separate people and they made different countries,\nsmall countries, which didn't exist before. They made this a country, this a country, they made all\ndifferent countries, before it was all united. And all this encouraged someone like Hitler to bring\nthem together again and to tell the people, you see, don't worry about it, you are not treated well, the\nVersailles Treaty didn't treat you well and there's inflation and you can't get anything, no jobs,\nnothing. I will bring the sun. But he could only do this by having a scapegoat and he took the Jews,\nbecause the Jews are very, very passive in this way. So therefore, from this point of view, giving\nhim the power, people gave him the power, so that Holocaust came about.",
        "A: No, the Jews don't resist, you see, the Jews try to go along with the government, whatever the\ngovernment is. In fact, even here in America, after Truman I think, they mention the name of the\npresident in every prayer. Roosevelt especially, Truman. After Truman, I think. They did not want\nto, they accepted whatever, whatever the government said. Pray for the welfare of the government,\nso they accepted it. What should they have done? What should they have done?",
        "A: It has to be honest. The first thing that happened, what Hitler did, it was in education. He\nchanged the, all the pictures in the books of the kindergarten and who knows what and put in the\nJews with the big nose and with hook and this kind of thing and such a person you have to hate.\nYou can put everything into a child's mind, a child doesn't know the difference between right and\nwrong. They learned this only much later. So therefore, if a child does not get the right information\nfrom the beginning, everything goes wrong. And that's why this sof the \u2014\u2014___ and other\nthings, taught them wrong. Education is very important.",
        "A: What should they do? The Jews education does not, does not emphasize war or things of this\nsort, or hate or, even the Christian religion you see, says love your neighbor like yourself. And\nmany religions teach, say this, but the difference 1s, we say and I don't know if I should say it, but\nwe say, that's a way to act, not that's a way to think only. Roosevelt said it. Roosevelt knew\nonly in mind, but not in action. Same thing also with religion you see, to love your neighbor like\nyourself in your mind, yes, but in your action, not. The action has to follow what you say in your\nmind, if not so, not so. So that's what they have to teach the children here, to really act, to be\ntogether, to be friends with each other and so forth, to have more kind of realistic system, not just in\nyour mind.",
        "A: It seems so.",
        "A: There are certain, in certain areas in which you should not be passive, but that I cannot say and\nmake everyone responsible for, that 1s, there are certain laws, let's say the 10 Commandments, you\nsee, they should be more active in those, not to kill, not to steal and so forth, you see, and just be\nmore active in that, not only the Jews, everybody. Because what's going on now with the drug\nscene, with the killing and so forth, they don't believe it. So, so there are certain, certain laws\nwhich, which every person should understand, logically. And that they should teach them and not\nonly teach them to think about this, I want to, I don't want to preach here, you see, you see.",
        "A: Except, I don't know if I gave you everything, because it's impossible, there are too many things\nto be remembered and too many things which happened, but, if you want to build a world of peace,\nthat all people want to do now, at least they say so, then, then we have to, then we have to give\neveryone the equal opportunity, but it's unfortunate that many times, as soon as someone gets a little\nbit higher, he wants the whole, he wants everything you see, people aren't satisfied with a finger,\nthey want the whole hand. And, we wrote once, an essay, we _ wrote an essay in school, when I\nwas in the Nazi school and the essay was called, German loyalty. The Germans were always loyal\nto their leader, not only were they loyal to their leader, also they wanted to be on top of everybody.\nAnd they believed in the Darwin theory, the survival of the fittest, we have to be the fittest, the\nGermans said. Now if everyone thinks I'm the fittest and he will always subdue other ones and have\nweaker ones whom he destroys and that's what I want to end with. The teacher once, once asked\nme, he brought it out in a class and he said, \"The Germans are superior and all the other races are\ninferior, because we are the strongest, we are the tallest, we are the blondest, we have the bluest\neyes,\u201d and so forth. And, and he said to me, this was a Nazi teacher, \"What do you think about it?\"\nI said to him, \"There is nothing in this world superior or inferior, everyone can rise to a high level,\neveryone can go low. But there is one thing in this world which the Nazis don't recognize and that's\nthat every person's different and you don't realize the difference between one person, everyone\ncontributes something you see and you cannot put him down because he's different and him down\nbecause he's different in this way and he's different in that way.\" Same thing like happens in\nAmerica now. Everyone's different, they can all contribute and as long as they contrib, as long as\nsomeone thinks I am superior and you are inferior, I am a majority and you are a minority. Once a\nperson in my office told me, \"The Jews are not a minority,\" he said to me. \"Not in New York, \" I\nsaid, but maybe another thing. So I asked him, \"When does a minority stop to be a minority? I\nasked him. He couldn't answer that. But someone's, if someone works under the logical thinking\nthat he's a minority, then he will always strive to be a majority, we always strive to majority and\nthere will always be a fight going on, but the only time someone thinks I'm different, I have certain\nthings which you don't have and you have certain things which I don't have, then they will live\ntogether in peace.",
        "A: Accept it or not.",
        "A: I think I made a mistake, it should not be called Nazi school, but German school. Because when\nHitler came to power, all the previous directors and teachers were either asked to become members\nof the Nazi party, or leave the school. So the director in my school, where I went, the , had\nbeen with the Social Democrat party and he was dismissed. And from then on, there were two\nkinds of teachers, the teachers who were members of the party from long time ago, the early\nnumbers, all the early numbers had priority or a later number. But they came all in with the Nazi\nemblem, which was like a lifesaver and there was written NASDP, National Socialist Democratic\nWorkers Party, that's how they called themselves, with a swastika in the middle and one teacher\ncame in with a Nazi uniform and whenever a teacher came in, the students get up and says Heil\nHitler, when the teacher leaves the classroom, Heil Hitler, they all stand up. But that was, that was\nalready before that they would stand up, but that was respect for the teacher, because you were, you\nwere supposed to have respect for the teacher, the teacher was a high official in Germany.",
        "A: I stand up, but I did not have to lift the hand with the Heil Hitler salute or the Nazi salute, but\nthere was, when you came into the building, there was a teacher standing and everyone when he\ncame in, would lift his hand. I didn't have to lift my hand, but then on the other hand, some people\nwho didn't know it, would beat you up if you didn't do it.",
        "A: No, not for that. But I tell you, I saw a boy on a bicycle, he met a Nazi and he lifted his hand and\nhe fell from his bike, so they said on the bike, you don't have to lift your hand, just make, sit up\nstraight. But this teacher came in and one of these teachers who was from Strasbourg, Alsace-\nLorraine, which was French and German again, he called me over, his son was in my own, in my\nclass, in my class, same class as I am. He said to me privately, \"You know, I am not actually anti-\nSemitic,\" he said, \"but in order to keep my job, I have to put this life saver on,\" he said to me. And,\nand this other teacher I told you about, he gave a course in Assencunder(ph), it means knowledge of\nthe races.",
        "A: Thad to take it. The only thing is, afterwards they changed, that I didn't go on Shabbat any more\nto school, so this teacher was an older teacher, he was 65 at that time, he called me over and he said\nto me, \"If you don't come to school on Saturday, I'm going to teach Hitler's Kampf, Mein Kampf,\nthe book on Saturday, so you do, are not there. And if you miss anything, I will give you the, I will\ntell some student to give you the homework,\" see there, but still, some teachers of, from the older\nclass, you see. But they had to be members, you see and if you had and if not, they could be\ndismissed. Now him they probably left, he was going anyhow, retirement age 65 there, he left.\nThat's okay, but, but I help as a teacher, you see, when he gave this kind, so I asked a question, what\nmakes it. ~ Why does he know everything? So they taught that he has intuition that comes\nfrom himself Hitler does not believe in manifestation from above, because there's no one above\nhim. No God, no nothing, he didn't believe in God, even though he was Catholic. So there's no\nmanifestation from above, everything comes from the blood and soil and it goes up to him and he\nknows it by intuition. What they call a, I forget already the word in German, but it's something like\na combination of blood and soil.",
        "A: They taught me similar things and they also taught me that the German race is superior. Why?\nBecause when God created the world in he interprets the bible, but not the correct way of course, he\ncreated man and then they believe in Darwin's theory, that the fittest survive, only the survival of the\nfittest, so that means the fittest survive and we are the fittest. The Jews are not fit, that's why they\nhave to be eradicated. And about this, what I mentioned before about inferiority and superiority and\nwhich I don't believe in, I believe in the same thing, you see, but difference, differency,\ndifferentiation, but I don't believe in superior and this other thing. And finally, oh, not about that. I\nwas the only student of 700 in that school, that was a big school.",
