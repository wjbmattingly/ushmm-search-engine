        "Q: Welcome.",
        "A: Nice July day.",
        "Q: Indeed. Tell me your name.",
        "A: My formal name is Charles Siegman, my birth name is Charlie Sigmann, or Jechiel\nSigmann, I was born Jechiel, the Hebrew name, and that itself is a introduction to where I\ncome from. People always ask, how does a good Jewish boy get the name Charlie from\nHolland. And the story is that my father had to register me. In Holland, all children had to\nbe registered by an official roster of names. And when my father came, he asked what\u2019s\nchild\u2019s name, he answered Chiel, which was the shortened name for Jechiel. And Chiel\nwas not on the list of names, and he had to choose an official name. So the first Ch was\nCharlie. That was a Dutch name, and so my name became Charlie. And when I came to\nUnited States, they changed it to Charles, because Charlie looked like a child name.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But [indecipherable] re-registered or became a citizen, I finally made it to Charles Jechiel\nSiegman, so --",
        "Q: And were you called Jechiel at home?",
        "A: Yes, Chiel, yes.",
        "Q: Chiel?",
        "A: Chiel, or Jechiel [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And when were you born?",
        "A: October 13\", 1935.",
        "Q: And you were born where?",
        "A: In a little suburb town of The Hague called Scheveningen, which was a fishing town, but\nit was a really an adjunct town of The Hague, and eventually my parents moved to The\nHague in 1940.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So -- but it was a little -- known for its fishing fleet, in fact, and in the war, the name\nScheveningen was the shibboleth term by the Germans and the Dutch, because the\nGermans couldn\u2019t pronounce the sra sound of the guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S-\nShravening -- Shaveningen. So when the soldiers who were dressed in Dutch uniforms,\nGerman soldiers, the early stage of the war, were asked whether you\u2019re, you know, friend\nor foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and\nthey were shot. So that\u2019s the part of the town, anyway, it\u2019s a small town.",
        "Q: Sin -- since you were such a young person during this period, having been born in 1935,\nit would be good if we could try to distinguish between what you actually remember,\nwhen we talk about the experiences, and what you were -- what you were told, so we can\nget an idea what your memory is versus what you\u2019re remembering from other people\u2019s, if\nyou think we can do that.",
        "A: Correct. Yes. Difficult to identify every --",
        "Q: Yes, no, no, I understand, right.",
        "A: -- part of the element. This definitely is a blend, what I recall now, or I relate now, is a\nblend of what I recall -- what I think I recall --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: [indecipherable], as -- what I\u2019ve heard, which I have seen confirmed, in fact, what I have\n-- things have re -- recors -- subsequently confirmed in writing, so I guess I attributed it to\nmy recall as well. And what I\u2019ve read, and heard, and talked with my brother and sister,\nor others. But as I\u2019ve mentioned to you, otherwise, my recall is spotty, and more in the\nsense of mental imprints, like [indecipherable]. Some absolute I recall, I -- I fix in my\nmind to this day I could see certain pictures, and I don\u2019t have a running --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] a commentary, nor the chronology thing.",
        "Q: Right. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Definitely months, or periods which I have no idea what happened when, or whether\nanything happened at all in a three month period.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I know episodes, and episodes kind of tell my story in the context of the Holocaust,\nor Shoah.",
        "Q: Right. Let\u2019s get a sense of your -- your family before we get into your particular tale.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Who was your dad, and what did he do?",
        "A: Right. My father was born in Poland, Przemysl, established Jewish little community, and\nhe moved to western Europe, I believe first to Germany, then to Holland, in the 20\u2019s,\nbefore he was married, in fact.[indecipherable] long time settler, and was another refugee\ncoming from eastern Europe, or from Germany to Holland, lived there for many years.\nHe was not a citizen ever, he was stateless, he was Polish nationality. But for Holland he\nwas called stateless, but Polish nationality, I believe. My mother came originally from\nZborow, which people think wer -- was Hungary, could be Ukraine, cause the countries\nthis -- have shifted management over time, and was raised in Switzerland. At a very\nyoung age she moved to Switzerland. Her parents were -- grandparents, parents were one\nof the early settlers of the east European families who moved to Zurich. Again, that\nfamily, that group of families, I was told, could not move to Zurich, didn\u2019t have the right\nto move to Zurich, they moved outside of Zurich, to -- they had a lot of restrictions. And\nmy parents were married in the early 20\u2019s -- in \u201922, and the wedding had to be held in\nFrankfurt, because a large number of members of the family couldn\u2019t receive visas to go\nto Zurich, where the -- typically, the bride\u2019s family town would be the wedding. I have\nthe wedding picture of that wedding with me, which is a nice memento. That also has a\nShoah story about it in fact. But anyhow, my father lived in Holland, and he was a\npostage stamp dealer, had a postage stamp store, had a wholesaler type of business, and\nhad the store and lived origin -- he originally lived in Amsterdam with my older brothers\nwere born in Amsterdam, and then moved to Scheveningen, and he had a store in one of\nthe main streets. So he was a middle class person, nothing, no -- not an activist, not a\nSocialist, not a pervert, or what have you, and belonged to the east European community\nin Scheveningen.",
        "Q: Ca-Can you explain what it means to own a postage store, that\u2019s not stamp collecting, or\nis it?",
        "A: Yes, stamp -- no, stamp collecting, postage stamps.",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "A: Stamp collecting, or providing postage stamps to other stamp s -- th -- used to be many\nmore small stores in Europe, to this day there are more than United States, who -- that\nspecialized in particular items, so there -- now, also there are few postage stamp stores in\nthe United States, most probably have s -- some Bethesda. But that was the job, to collect\nstamps from the other countries, and organize them by country, and know the dates, and\nthe value, and they sell them to dealers, or to customers. So, postage stamps. He had his\nown, apparently a very personal, good postage stamp collection as well, which he gave\nover to someone, acquaintance or a friend, we don\u2019t know exactly who, before the war. It\nnever returned after the war.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of going into the store?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no, no, not at all, no, no. I -- but I do know that he dealt with postage stamps.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whatever that meant, as a child, but oh -- but I-I see them around, I mean postage stamps\nwere very popular, much more than today --",
        "Q: So you recall in the house seeing the postage stamps?",
        "A: I saw, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And did your mother work as well?",
        "A: No, I believe she was home, as far as I recall. And we -- as -- we are a family of five\nchildren. I was the youngest, born in \u201935, and my sister in \u2019?33, and my brother in \u201931.",
        "Q: So ma -- so Leah is born in \u201933?",
        "A: Y-Yes, \u00b033 --",
        "Q: And Leo 1s born --",
        "A: -- Leo was born in \u201931, and my two other brothers who were killed during the war, in\nAuschwitz, they were born in \u201926, and \u201924.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s Aron --",
        "A: Ah -- yo -- jos -- Josef --",
        "Q: Jos -- Josef?",
        "A: -- was born in 20 si -- 1926, and Aron -- Erik, was born in 1924. So they were\nsubstantially older than I wa-was. As a child there\u2019s a big difference, obviously.",
        "Q: So during this period before the war, between -- before the war comes to the Netherlands,\nbetween \u00b035 and \u201940, what is your memory of that household?",
        "A: It was a household that was living, I would call middle class life, going to do certain\nactivities, like with fam -- family oriented activities, and Scheveningen was a resort town,\nso there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it\u2019s still a resort town, the beach, and -- so it\nwas an active household. I don\u2019t know much about the social life of my family, so I can\u2019t\nrelate to that. But so I know from the child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal\nincidents which are interesting in their own right, but the fact that I recall them, but also\nthe interesting feature is that both of these little child events -- childhood events where I\nwas actually was saved, kind of -- that\u2019s all I recall. The first one was I was lost in the\nbeach. So the family went to the beach, that\u2019s [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity,\nit was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that\u2019s not unusual. And the police picked me\nup, and I do recall that I was sitting on the policeman\u2019s lap, with a policeman\u2019s cap on my\nhead, waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough, till they found -- till I was\nfound, I think my brother came to pick me up, and then reunited with the family, so I was\nsaved. That was what -- what -- what do we do. Second episode which I recall, was I took\na walk with my sister [indecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a\nshortcut through a park, and was hit by a wooden swing, that time the swings were wood,\nand I was apparently unconscious. I had a sort of a scar right over here. They tell me that\nhad it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I would have been brain dead, centimeter\nbelow, I\u2019d have been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact. I had stitches. Those days\nyou had stitches with like staples, I remember that. And I remember the gift coming\nhome to soothe my return, was a wind-up crocodile, which I wound up and I played on\nthe dining room table, back and forth. So these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but\nthey kind of illustrate I\u2019d led a child\u2019s normal, quotation mark, child\u2019s life in a home\nenvironment.",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents at tha -- 1-1-1n that period when you were [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, again, I remember them as, y -- know, se -- senior adults.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was the baby of the family, and I don\u2019t remember any story or event that kind of left a\nmark with me, but I knew my -- my mother was a housewife, and remember cleaning the\nhouse, and taking care of the household events. The hou -- I mean, the household, as far\nas I recall, I have heard was kind of gran -- rather normal. We had a lot of visitors, I do\nrecall people coming by, and we confirmed -- subsequently I met certain people, relatives\n[indecipherable] I visited when I was a little child with my parents, and down the line.\nAnd that was a kind of -- it was a f -- a close link to families.",
        "Q: Right. Was it a religious household?",
        "A: Yes, was a religious household.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was re -- we were raised -- ra-raised as observant Jews. Synagogue --",
        "Q: Was that --",
        "A: -- attending --",
        "Q: Was that unusual in Holland, or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- not so much?",
        "A: Not really, no. First of all, Holland has two or three communities, the more -- can\u2019t say\nnative, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutch are oriented, people had a number of\ngenerations. They had their own synagogues, and own community. Then there were the\neast European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted and integrated. But\nin Europe in general, there was much more traditional conduct by people affiliated with\nsynagogues, and went. My parents were fully observant, a kosher home, and active in\nZionist organizations. My brother -- my older brothers, Josef and Aron belonged to what\nlater became Brei Akiva, but precursor of those that were active in that, and I do kind of\nhave memories on Shabbat afternoons, they were leaving to their groups. All I really\nremember of my two older brothers in a mental, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall\nboys with berets -- common people used to wear berets, and weeker pants, which were\nrolled up at the bottom a little bit, leaving, coming and going. But they were kind of\nactive in youth organizations. So it wasn\u2019t, again, in the broader sense, that description\nwere a normal family, as people would have liked to live, and were not allowed to live.",
        "Q: D-Do you recall your little friends that you had during that period [indecipherable] family\nand your --",
        "A: I do not recall friends at all --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in fact, I mean, in part because we had a sizeable family and had two children -- my\nbro -- siblings were close enough in age, I suppose. So I do not recall from before the\nwar, anyone by name, or so. That\u2019s a -- whether I had it, I just don\u2019t know, I mean, never\ndiscussed that with my brother or sister at all.",
        "Q: Did you go to a nur -- was there something [indecipherable] to a nursery school, or --",
        "A: No, I do recall starting school in 1942. I was only half a year in school. We went to\nwhat\u2019s called then a public Jewish school, it could -- what\u2019s called nowadays day schools,\nmost probably. They were Jewish schools, and this was bef -- my brother went before\nthat -- I had to go, cause at the time already when I was going to school, I had to be\nenrolled in a Jewish school, it wouldn\u2019t -- now the Nazis did not allow --",
        "Q: So that was late already.",
        "A: Late already.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I do remember for going to school, and in kind of the courtyard, singing, playing, and\nI was supposed to be a good boy, called in Dutch, witte boontje -- bon -- boontje, that\nwas a white bean, that\u2019s description of being in -- a goody-goody boy, or so. But the\nschool period was a very tense period. People -- there was all kinds of talk going on\nalready around the house and in the school, murmurings. What it meant, I had no idea. I\nknew that something was brewing.",
        "Q: This is in \u00b042?",
        "A: That was \u00b042.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know what.",
        "A: No, but there was something unusual, was nothing -- it was like something was involving\n-- and I sensed, I di -- I do recall sensing -- to the school year was both disrupted\nobviously, I was -- it couldn\u2019t last very long, several months only, but 1t was not a normal\nschool experience, because the people in the classes were eventually in doubt. People\ncame, and people left. And I si -- this I -- this I did sense, that was an indifferent -- not --\nnot that I had been in school for many years, so as what I did go to a pre-school, I don\u2019t\nrecall. But it was not a stable environment, and this I had sensed right away, both at\nhome, where there were murmurings, and most [indecipherable] parents whisper amongst\nthemselves something, you know, something that\u2019s serious. What exactly it was, I don\u2019t\nrecall. Was as bes -- I -- and was probably children brought into discussions. And of\ncourse I was too young, because I was a child.",
        "Q: Do you have a recollection of 1940, when the Nazis occupied?",
        "A: No. No, no, no.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t --",
        "A: No, wa -- w --",
        "Q: Is -- is there a transition for you at all?",
        "A: The big transition really was when I was in school and I felt that -- I mean, for it -- I think\nit was big discussion which school I should go to, whether I should start y -- with school.\nI re -- kind of there was general discussion, I was on -- certainly going to go to school.\nBecause that already in -- was -- was probably the fall, I assume school began in the fall\nlike over here, was come to the end of our freedom, because people -- there were\ndeportations, and there were round-ups and there were sh -- transports taking place, so\nthere was some discussion whether or not I should start school. In retrospect it appears\nthat my family, my parents were almost, I think, you know, how to deal with the family\nsituation of how to -- not escape, but wh -- w -- to find means t -- how to survive. So if\nthey have to -- if I hid -- if they would place me in hiding, or what have you, then you\ndon\u2019t start school, necessarily. But anyway, I did go to school, and that school\nenvironment, I sensed there was something in the air, what I don\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t specify.",
        "Q: But the kids didn\u2019t talk with each other, that you remember?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not --",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing troops? Do you remember seeing any soldiers, or --",
        "A: Noth -- I can\u2019t -- ca-can\u2019t -- I\u2019m looking [indecipherable] at my mental photograph file\nthere, no, I don\u2019t recall soldiers. There were soldiers on the street, but wa -- I may have\ntreated them as policemen, or so, so --",
        "Q: Right. So you never saw anything that made you frightened, or --",
        "A: No, no, no, again I that -- in that respect my parents protected me, kept me, you know, do\nthings -- I wore the --",
        "Q: A star.",
        "A: A Star.",
        "Q: And you remember that?",
        "A: On the clothing, yes. But again it didn\u2019t impact me as 1t would have done later. It was a,\nyou know, decoration that something -- that the -- only Jews were wearing it, I may not\nhave been sensitive enough.",
        "Q: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Okay\u201d? But I had to wear it, yes. But that\u2019s, you know, you wear your sweater, you wear\nyour jacket.",
        "Q: And do you think that the same protection and feeling of being -- you\u2019re pretty safe, was\ntrue for your -- for Leo, and Leah --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how far hi -- how hi-high it would went, right, then because an -- a -- a child\nin general is left out for these sort of discussions, and the youngest, I was a young child,\nwas not -- was not a party. I was -- I was almost six and a half, seven, right? So I was\n[indecipherable] a party to these discussions. I don\u2019t really know how much my brother --\nmy brother I think even more.",
        "Q: Leo, or the older --",
        "A: Leo, Leo, Leo. The older brothers definitely.",
        "Q: Yeah, I mean --",
        "A: But I had very little ongoing contact with my older brothers, except as being older\nbrothers, but not on a playing se-sense, and I don\u2019t even recall which grade they were --\nthey were, you know, adults, and they were adults already. By 1942 my oldest brother\nwas -- \u201924 to \u00b042 -- ah -- was 18 years old, and [indecipherable] was 16.",
        "Q: Right. So they were much older.",
        "A: They were much older. So the contact between a seven year old, and a 18 or a 16 year old\nare --",
        "Q: Big difference.",
        "A: Big difference.",
        "Q: Right. Now, do you re -- do you know how many months you might have been in school?\nWas it a few months, or --",
        "A: I think we were in school three, four months.",
        "Q: Before you went to Westerbork?",
        "A: Before -- no, before Westerbork, I was -- we were already -- our family was split up. In --\nin November, December, I think, our family started splitting up.",
        "Q: 1941.",
        "A: \"42. \u00b042. 1942.",
        "Q: 42.",
        "A: We end up in Westerbork in \u201943, and in Terezin in \u00b044.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay.",
        "A: [indecipherable] \u201942 now.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So [indecipherable] say it was -- that\u2019s why th -- you say whether or not I would go to\nschool was [indecipherable] issue, cause by \u201942, in the fall of \u201942, later developments\nwith Dutch Jewry oc-occurred already, deportations, shipments, round-ups. We were not\nlast, but we were not first, either.",
        "Q: Okay, so --",
        "A: So the family planned to [indecipherable] our situation, and what wa -- was happening --\nwhat happened was that my mother and two older brothers, Erik and Josef -- Aron and\nJosef, they went to one location, my sister to another, and my brother and myself to\nanother. And bro -- those locations were strange in retrospect, but made sense at the time.\nThere was a notion that certain people are less likely to be rounded up, or perhaps even\nimmune, exempt. So if you stay, even with Jewish families that have that character about\nthem, you are protected. So the notion was that my mother and her brothers, who were of\nworking age, they were put into a -- a mental asylum, because the thought was that they\ndon\u2019t need -- they\u2019re not going to be prom -- people at -- either accepted or believed the\ncase that there were the people being shipped for work. So, they\u2019re not going to take\npeople who have mental problems, they\u2019I] leave them alone, spend your energies\nelsewhere. My sister was placed in another type of home, and initially with, I believe in\nher case, a pregnant woman, who again they thought wouldn\u2019t be taken, or a woman who\nhad just given birth. That was sort of conventional wisdom at that time, and so we were\nseparated from our parent, and the parent itself -- my father stayed at home.",
        "Q: Your father at home, your mother in another place, where is the [indecipherable]",
        "A: My -- my fa -- my -- my mother and my two older brothers in another place, and my\nsister in one place, and my brother and I in another place.",
        "Q: And where were you then?",
        "A: With my brother.",
        "Q: No, I know that, but --",
        "A: To -- to this family, I think to -- to a woman had just given birth.",
        "Q: And what were you told about -- I mean, it\u2019s very odd for a little child to be separated\nlike that.",
        "A: Yes, Ill see you later, you know, we\u2019ll come back. Now, what is interesting 1s that\npeople had -- ma -- see I -- the reason my father stayed at home apparently, was to kind\nof settle affairs, his belongings, and who knows what, and come -- and contact with\nfamily outside of Holland, I believe, which eventually materialized somewhat for that,\nand to make arrangements for everybody. So, not clear whether our arrangements were\ntemporary or permanent. My parents were the ones who were making those decisions,\nand I was obviously not privy to those at all. So they have a sense of being in diff -- sure,\nthings were different, but whether it\u2019s permanent or temporary, I had no sense of that at\nall. And my brother was there, so maybe that acted as a sense of stability for me. And the\ndays went. There also was a conventional wisdom, which was [indecipherable] based on\nfact, that round-ups took place late afternoon, evening. So in the morning, my father, he\nwent to synagogue, and we went to synagogue too, we met my father every morning at\nsynagogue. So that respect, things were normal. So we met, and he patted me, chatted\nme, kissed me or s -- what, and it was a daily event. And my last image of my father is\nsitting on his lap, he with his tefillin on, and next day I came he wasn\u2019t there. So then we\nknew that he was deported.",
        "Q: And you knew that, or you knew something?",
        "A: We knew something.",
        "Q: You knew something.",
        "A: Right, yeah, my brother and I knew something, right. And --",
        "Q: And this is 1942?",
        "A: \"42, December \u201942.",
        "Q: December \u201942. So right at the end of the year.",
        "A: That\u2019s end of the year.",
        "Q: So you are staying with this -- in this family [indecipherable]",
        "A: Family, right, now that didn\u2019t last --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- not di -- no, not -- not two, three months, not -- very short period. That family sofe\neither couldn\u2019t keep us, or what have you, and we were put all three of us in an\norphanage.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because again, the view was that the orphanage is a safe haven. They aren\u2019t going to take\nlittle children, little orphans. And meanwhile my mother and two brothers were rounded\nup, my father was rounded up and they move -- they were shipped to Westerbork in the\nend of January.",
        "Q: Of \u00b043.",
        "A: \"43.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And middle of January they were deported to Auschwitz and killed there three days later.\nWe were rounded up a little later, in February, I guess.",
        "Q: In -- in February.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. I think we have to stop it to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Charles, your parents were sent -- th -- your parents, your two older brothers were sent to\nWesterbork in January of \u00b043.",
        "A: Three, right.",
        "Q: And in February, you think --",
        "A: We -- yes, we arrived in February.",
        "Q: You arrived in February, and were they sent out --",
        "A: They were sent out of west -- out of Westerbork on the 18\" of January.",
        "Q: Huh, and -- and when did you find that out, that wh -- that was the transport?",
        "A: Well, through the red -- subsequently, in recent years, I\u2019ve tried to trace down through the\nRed Cross, that -- curious to find out what --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- formally happened, any documentation. Took a long time, oddly enough. It\u2019s very\nstrange that the record keeping was so uneven. After the war -- I mean, now moving --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- on to a different subject matter, after the war, people tried to find out what happened to\ntheir relatives. And in our case, we were more or less told by relatives and others, that our\nparents were deported and sent to Auschwitz and that was the als -- we had no\ndocumentation for that. As a child I did not pursue it very much, but later on as an adult, I\ntried to pursue it, especially when I read about that the Red Cross had tracing of a sort.\nAnd the first few answers was -- is all we know is that they were deported to Auschwitz,\nwe don\u2019t know when, where. Later on they gave us a date, but no formal document\nconfirmation. In year 2001\", I got a Red Cross notification with documentation. Now, it\nturns out that in the Dutch registry, in the -- the government has a regis -- gazettes of a\nsort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed names of the fate of various people, and they send\nus a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who we addressed -- now, had we known that\nit was in the registry, I would have gone to the Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that\nit is available. So the first time I actually had confirmation of my parents death and\ndeparture dates, which initially came really out, that was in year 2000. A long time. And\nin fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- commemoration, not celebration, commemoration of\ndeceased, was an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to commemorate. So --\nyou may be aware that the rabbinate in Israel selected one date of the year for those\npeople that did not know when their immediate families were killed, or died. And they\nselected the 10 of Tevet, but -- so we observe that day as our Yahrzeit day. So the f --\ntook us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actual date, which turned out to be the 15\" of\nShavuot, so --",
        "Q: And did Westerbork have deportation lists, or they didn\u2019t?",
        "A: Did they have -- I -- yeah, I\u2019m sure they had, but -- there\u2019s just what happened after the\nwar, a lot of people made confusion, a lot of people made efforts, di -- they hit a\nroadblock, and they kind of called it quits, or so, and nobody came notifying us. I mean,\nthis is a problem, it\u2019s a two sided way, be -- those who knew, didn\u2019t know us, and we\ndidn\u2019t know who knew, okay? So you ask me how do I know the dates, now it\u2019s in black\nand white and confirmed, and it\u2019s from lists -- a big list in the Dutch registry. I have a\ncopy of the registry here with me.",
        "Q: Now, did your mother arrange for the three of you to go to an orphanage? Do you kno --\ndo you know how that was arranged at all?",
        "A: I believe it was probably through my father.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Cause he -- th-they were picked up and -- in beginning of January, I believe, the first\nweek or so, and then they were -- must have been a week or so in Westerbork, and so we\nwere -- was probably more through my father. The -- these -- there were a lot of ad hoc\narrangements during that period. Some were planned, and some were, you know, you had\nto improvise, and as -- when one option kind of reached it\u2019s end of contini -- continue,\nlike me being in these private homes, where people thought was safe, they found a next\ntier. So we lasted another month in these different places, compared to my parents and\nmy brothers. And then you ask me, you know, did I know what was happening to me, the\nanswer is no. I was, know, placed. I was with people. I was most probably being fed, and\ntaken care of, and that took care of me. I did know that 1 -- used to go to the synagogue in\nthe morning, routine, that stopped. And my brother knew more, he knew that -- what it\nmeant. That once he didn\u2019t see us, that he\u2019d been dep -- rounded up and being deported.\nSo it must have --",
        "Q: And he -- he didn\u2019t tell you? Do you remember -- any recollection?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know. I don\u2019t know that part.",
        "Q: So not seeing your parents, I mean --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: Being in this different place --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- this woman\u2019s home --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: -- and seeing your father every day, would give you the sense of --",
        "A: Of some normalcy, also, right --",
        "Q: Some normalcy, right.",
        "A: Exactly right.",
        "Q: And then it stops.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And now you\u2019re in an orphanage.",
        "A: Yes. With other children.",
        "Q: With other children. Do you feel -- you don\u2019t feel insecure?",
        "A: I apparently don --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But again, you can keep in mind, if you rec -- reconstruct, if you\u2019re among a lot of\nchildren, suddenly, you are busy, you play, you eat, and you\u2019re taken care of, and you\nstart forgetting. It\u2019s like, you know, little children with babysitters, when the mother\u2019s --\nparents go on vacation, may cry beginning, and subsequently settle down, and -- not that\nit was so nor -- I\u2019m -- not that it was all shipped away. I don\u2019t recall being shipped away.\nBut that was circumstances.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I did not attribute it to, you know, imminent danger, or -- except my parents no longer\nwere visible with me, I\u2019d -- I -- my mother had less contact, because while I was coming\nto the synagogue in the morning, was my father.",
        "Q: Not your mother.",
        "A: Not my mother.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And not my older brothers. So definitely I must have sensed things were different, but\nwhether that is permanent, or whether that is dangerous, or [indecipherable] I don\u2019t think\na child could catch it immediately, because nothing terrible was happening to me. I\nwasn\u2019t being beaten up, or on the street, or something of this sort. So I mean, I was under\nsomebody\u2019s supervision and auspices, and that\u2019s how I -- I took it, I suppose.",
        "Q: Do you know whether this was a Jewish orphanage?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It was a Jewish orphanage?",
        "A: I believe it --",
        "Q: So all the kids were Jewish?",
        "A: -- I believe it -- I believe it was a Jewish orphanage. I believe so.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But again, based on this assumption, that certain categories of people are going to be\nbypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups notion obviously came very known in the\nJewish community. People\u2019s friends and relatives were being picked up, and people swen\n-- started going into hiding, or escaping, or what have you. Some tried to make\nprovisions. Then they tried to find ways which regarded what are -- where could we or\nour children be safe? And the idea of splitting up families was not a illogical step, that if\nsome people can\u2019t make it, other could make it. And very often, you can\u2019t have a place\nfor seven people, you can have a place for two or three. So you had to split up on\npractical grounds. So, did it hit me that something was affecting me, you know, lifetime\norsat, I doubt it, it was kind of incremental, another step or so. But di -- bottom line was,\nyou know, I was separated from my parents at that age, and that was it. And then\nseparated from my brothers and mother, and that was it. And I was with my little -- older\nbrother, few years older, and a little older sister, and that we were together. And then I\nfollowed what was -- not instructed, where I was told to go, where to go, and move, and I\nmoved along with the -- the flow.",
        "Q: And you were a good kid.",
        "A: Apparently.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay. But in February when we were rounded up, I do recall the round-up part in\nparticular. We put on the train, and it was a round-up place in Amsterdam, the\nSchouwburg, I think it\u2019s called. Schombu -- Schomb -- Schouwburg, it used to be a\ntheater. That became the round-up place for all the Jews in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: But now I\u2019m a little confused.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: Were you now living in Amsterdam? Because they [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, the orphanage was -- the orphanage was in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: In Amsterdam.",
        "A: Oh yes, the orphanage in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: But your father was not living in Amsterdam.",
        "A: In The Hague.",
        "Q: In The Hague.",
        "A: Hague.",
        "Q: Which 1s fr --",
        "A: He was rounded up in The Hague.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: He was rounded up in The Hague, and my -- I don\u2019t recall where the mental institution\nwas --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was probably as -- out -- they didn\u2019t have institutions in the cities, 1t was probably in\nthe outskirt, someplace. And -- but the round-ups don\u2019t -- they took the collected people\nand assembled them, and they brought them all to Amsterdam. That was the collection\npoint. And then f --",
        "Q: Right. And you re -- you remember being taken out of the orphanage?",
        "A: I remember the -- being in the train in Amsterdam, and people scurrying back and forth\nfrom the window. In fact, one of my relatives was one of -- see the -- they had a -- the\ncouncil of Jewish -- Jewish council had to do a lot of the paperwork for the round-ups,\nboth identify and do the works. I do recall people scurrying in front of the window, and\nmut -- this relative of mine who I knew, waving to me. I could see it now, I mean -- and\nthen we were put on the train to Westerbork. That was the next stop, the next movement,\nin February, sometime.",
        "Q: February \u00b043.",
        "A: 43. Turns out that had we arrived under normal circumstances, we -- they had a\nprocedure in Westerbork when people arrived, the next Tuesday, or the following one,\npeople were picked -- designated to go to the next stop. That time, \u201943, the destination\nwas Auschwitz. One after the other, every week or two, there was a trainload --",
        "Q: On Tuesdays, right?",
        "A: On Tuesday, right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: When we arrived in Westerbork, we would have designated to go the next shipment, but -\n- like everybody else, it wasn\u2019t exceptional. It turned out our good fortune was there was\na scarlet fever epidemic in Westerbork, a certain barracks, so they put the camp in\nquarantine, they wanted to protect the German soldiers, they don\u2019t want to get sick. So\nthis int -- this -- they halted the shipments for a week or so. That week was critical for us,\nbecause while we were there, during that quarantine, a very good friend of our family\u2019s in\nAmsterdam, Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by telegram most probably, Westerbork\nauthorities, the Jewish people, or the council people who worked there, that documents\nfrom our family in Switzerland, with Honduran passports, and also, I think, Palestine\nvisas were made available for us and our parents and brothers. Unfortunately for them it\ncame too late. But that week of window saved us, because then we put in different\ncategory of person, because we had Central American passports, and they treated that a\nlittle separate, and the Palestine visa part, they also had some benefit for awhile, because\nthey wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you, and it\nput us into a different classification of detainee, and then we were in this new category,\nand we were put into different grouping. But without that week of scarlet fever, I\nwouldn\u2019t be talking to you.",
        "Q: You would have been sent immediately on the train --",
        "A: Yes, we -- the norm -- right. The reason why -- we wouldn\u2019t be any different than\nanybody else. That was the pattern, people came, and left.",
        "Q: Now, did you know, cause you\u2019re now a little bit older, you\u2019re eight --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right? Or seven and a half? Seven.",
        "A: Seven.",
        "Q: Seven.",
        "A: Seven.",
        "Q: Were you told -- this scarlet fever quarantine --",
        "A: We were -- no, n-no, we were told --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, but we -- I was told about the papers, something.",
        "Q: You were told that?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. The other thing which I was told, I -- again, is our parents, from the train\nsend a postcard. That was very standard to drop postcards, and if they were lucky, other\ncitizens would pick it up and put it into the mail. And was given to my brother, he -- my\nbrother became the oldest person of the family, and I was told my brother had had a\npostcard from my parents, from what -- what it meant, I didn\u2019t know, but it was now\nwishing us well, take care, and in fact gave us the name of a relative in Switzerland if you\nneed help. And at the end of the postcard our brothers wrote in Hebrew [indecipherable]\nsee you. So I -- this I recall, my brother telling me walking somewhere in Westerbork,\nand telling pos -- not that -- I don\u2019t know, he tells more later, but the -- that we got a\npostcard from our parents on the train, wherever it is. Whatever that meant for me, I don\u2019t\nknow how to re-interpret it, but that little bit of information was given to us, but then we\nput into a new category of people -- not that we knew that we were different there\n[indecipherable] cause we didn\u2019t have the sense of this timetable which we know now.\nPeople didn\u2019t know, necessarily --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that -- came very rapidly. Now, moving people arrived, stayed, were registered, and\nthen they were shipped out to death camps.",
        "Q: How do you picture Westerbork in your mind?",
        "A: Small barracks, little wooden barracks, I recall, and we were put under the guidance of a\nS-s -- orphanage equivalent, a per -- one family was designated to take care of children\nwho were separated from their parents, or lost their parents, or what have you. And we\nput in that group, a man named Birnbaum, Mr. Birnbaum, originally from Germany\napparently, and that was his task. He had a number of children as well, so I became\nfriendly with his child, or he\u2019d like me to play with his child, so I hung around his house\nmore than the standard barracks most of the day. And I kind of took care of us,\ncollectively. But that status helped us, because we not put on lists. There is one episode\nmy brother related to me, which I obviously was not aware of. They didn\u2019t always trust\nthose documents, [indecipherable] they were -- were suspicious, and the fact came from\nSwitzerland helped a little bit, but they called my brother in, and was asking him what do\nyou know about Honduras? Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what. So he\nwas called in, and he was primed by someone, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should\nsay. And he was told that his mother\u2019s in Switzerland, to kind of confirm it, the source\ncame -- that came from his mother, rather than relatives. She was Swiss born, somehow.\nWas -- lived in Switzerland many years, and apparently -- he told me recently again, that\nhe was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how\u2019d you get these\nthings? My mother\u2019s in Switzerland. And they accepted, asked what -- where\u2019s your\nfather, and he didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t given any prompting for that, so he somehow answered,\nhe\u2019s dead, and they let him go. But again, I mean, those are kind of intermediate steps\nwhere our status was even being questioned, and had they determined that it was a fake, it\nwasn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t really, you know, Honduran citizens, or whatever, the passports\nwere not -- we then would have been shipped, that interval. So we spent the year in\nWesterbork among children.",
        "Q: So you lived in a barrack with children?",
        "A: Lived in a barrack with children, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the food?",
        "A: Very little. Was as -- Iremember a little more the food about Terezin --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- than the food in Westerbork, but there was food. I was, I think, not preoccupied with\nno -- being, again with -- in a group of children, that -- wa -- which probably helped me\nin various stages, that eventually yeah, you played, and you spend your time, and wha --\nwa-was fed, and that was it. My brother was a little more advanced, so he most probably\nhad to kind of keep his ears out what\u2019s happening, and he was therefore more perceptive.\nBut I was not drawn into that orbit at that stage of the game.",
        "Q: Did you notice children coming and going --",
        "A: Coming and go -- yes, yes, yes, yes, I noticed that there.",
        "Q: But that didn\u2019t necessarily affect you, because --",
        "A: No, because I was there, you see, and as long as I stayed next morning there -- I didn\u2019t --\nI mean, it\u2019s -- again, under the circumstances, my age, had no reason for me to think\nabout the instability of the situation. I mean, as an adult, you think my gosh, you know,\nlook what happened, were you scared, were you -- there\u2019s no -- no reason. I mean, the\nsaving feature was that I hung around with children, cause I was a child, and I was placed\nwith -- in a children\u2019s home, effectively. He was the guardian of a number of children,\nlots of them.",
        "Q: This Birnbaum?",
        "A: Birnbaum. And I was even better off, I was put in close contact with his own children. So\nI was playing and maybe eating at his table, who knows what? There were family units 1n\nthese camp situations, so that kept a little sense of normalcy. Not having my parents\nsomehow did not hit me during that period.",
        "Q: Was there something like a school? Did you have classes at some point?",
        "A: They have both there and in Terezin, they had little groups of study groups to keep\npeople entertained and educated a little bit, and teaching, you know, Jewish subject\nmatter, holidays, songs, and both -- some songs, in fact I do recall the music to this day.\nAnd --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Wh- What -- what do you recall?",
        "A: There was a round music in fact, Sim Shalom, with the prayer. It was a round. [sings a\nfew lines]. And we sang that, okay? And another one, Shomer Yisrael. Now, they\u2019re\ninteresting in retrospect, those two songs, which also in Terezin, the -- exactly the same\nsongs were taught, I recall, is quite remarkable, because both of them are the prayers of\nhope. We didn\u2019t know the translation as much, but the teachers kind of were injecting\nhope on this place, peace on Israel. Another one is God is the watcher of the remnant of\nIsrael. So, those two songs I remember to this day, but I didn\u2019t have -- it turns out that --\nthat people used to sing them subsequently too, so I don\u2019t know what I would --",
        "Q: I see. Sing a little bit of the second song?",
        "A: [sings a few lines of Shomer Yisrael] It was a choir rounding song, or so. And -- so we\nhad instructions, we had learning in both Terezin and ams -- and Westerbork. Westerbork\nI remember more concreteness that I know the loft where we went up, the third floor of\nthe caserne, third tier, not [indecipherable] floor, had three layers. We went up, and we\ndid our little studying, whatever it had to study, you know, instruction, the stories,\nholidays, about Israel, Palestine. And there was a watchman in front of the door\nwatching, because we\u2019re not allowed to have formal classes, and the watchman in\n[indecipherable] I remember the watchman, and whenever the SS guards, or their\nequivalent came by to inspect the place, we got the warning, and we started playing\ncards, or games, or what have you. Very, very similar to the story about Chanukah, where\npeople -- one reason why people played dreidl, because they -- because at that time also,\npeople were prohibited to study the Torah, and with guards coming by, and then people\nimprovised games.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so we went through that in 1943 and \u201944. But there was instruction, but not formal.",
        "Q: Could you read? Did you have some instruction [indecipherable]",
        "A: I had some instruction, well I had very little formal education --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- with three months or so, at best, in Holland, I -- yes, I learned how to read, maybe even\nbefore at home, I don\u2019t recall where. But I remember I read Dutch.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my vocabulary obviously was limited. Was -- didn\u2019t develop, I didn\u2019t have more -- I\nspoke Dutch among the Dutch people in Westerbork, obviously Dutch. And in Terezin\nalso. But I didn\u2019t read books in the normal sense of the term. But there was instruction.\nPeople spent again, their time. They devot -- there were former teachers who were idle,\nso they had some to do, and people took on responsibility to keep the kids occupied, and\nstudy with them. So that was familiar things, but not when it came back after the war I\nhad handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have the same background as other children.",
        "Q: I -- I read that the weather in Westerbork was horrible. Do you have any recollection if\nthat\u2019s true?",
        "A: Yeah, well, the weather was raw. Dutch weather is not, you know, the most comfortable\nweather except in the spr -- summertime or so. It\u2019s a variation of British weather, wet,\ncold. I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, but not as a personal suffering part, that it\nwas ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, in retrospect I just don\u2019t recall how we\nsurvived both the deprivation and weather conditions, both in Westerbork, and Terezin,\nwhich is even colder, because we didn\u2019t come with, you know, baggage of clothing. Must\nhave had some bags, and as we moved up in age, we grew. Now, I may have taken my\nbrother\u2019s clothing, but [indecipherable] my brother get? Now, we didn\u2019t grow that much.\nWe were stunted in our growth, most probably, but we still grew. So the question mark\nstill is, where did we get our clothing? We may have gotten it from other people who left,\nand the children\u2019s home may well have supplied us. But we didn\u2019t certainly have our own\nwardrobe to take care of us, particularly in cold weather. So every so often I do reflect,\nhow did we manage in cold weather in general, with limited clothing, and not having our\nown clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provide. But I -- I sp -- I assume that these\npeople like Mr. Birnbaum, and subsequently in Theresienstadt the woman who took care\nof us, kind of assembled material, and that there -- that was part of their job, to make sure\nthe children under their charge have clothing. And where they got it from was probably\nfrom people who had to -- we-were transported and left, and then it redistributed. So I\ndon\u2019t know how bitter the cold was for me personally. But it -- I do know it was drab.",
        "Q: Were you also limited where you could walk? Could you just stay around where this\nbarrack was?",
        "A: Well, here again see, I in some sense was a beneficiary of being a young child. I had no\nreason to parade in the large areas like most norm [indecipherable] and I was in this\nBirnbaum family, in their -- and was probably nu -- wherever I slept in the barracks, in\nthe morning go to the Birnbaum\u2019s. So that was my routine, so no reason for me to\nwonder.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the restrictions that existed most probably did not impair me, because there was no\nneed for me to wander around. So that respect, being young was a blessing.",
        "Q: And were you required to have a Jewish star on your clothes as well, do you remember?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. But that did not necessarily, you know, impact me dramatically because\nthat we had -- that [indecipherable] was on my sweater, and I wa -- it was cold you wore\na sweater, you wore that with the yode star on it. So again, in looking back on it, being a\nsm-small child, or a very young aged little boy protected me, gave me my own little area\nof protection, that I did not face a lot of the other things which I would have faced four\nyears later.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My brother had more exposure, both in Westerbork and in Terezin, because as you move\nup the ladder of age, you get -- you\u2019re drawn into these other restrictions. So I can\u2019t say\nthat I felt, you know, restricted or inhibited, like most children in today\u2019s environment\nmost probably wouldn\u2019t feel restricted if they cannot cross the street. You know, if you\nask them 20 years later, did you feel dil -- were you a prisoner of your neighborhood? I\ndon\u2019t think they would express it in these terms.",
        "Q: That makes sense. We\u2019re going to have to change the tape right now.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else that you would remember from Westerbork before you get\nsent to Terezin?",
        "A: Not much ta -- of detail, kind of that could mention -- that I have mentioned. I\n[indecipherable] come back subsequently.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "A: No, I think that\u2019s -- the time passed, and then we were --",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re a year --",
        "A: A year, we --",
        "Q: At Westerbork --",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "Q: -- from what, February --",
        "A: February to February.",
        "Q: -- fe -- February.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So in February \u201944 --",
        "A: \u201c44",
        "Q: Now, does somebody come and tell you tomorrow you\u2019re going to go to another place? I\nmean, how --",
        "A: Not to me, Leo.",
        "Q: Not to you?",
        "A: Not to me, again. I was -- I don\u2019t feel bad being left out. No, but we were told that ending\nup in west -- in Terezin -- see, in Theresienstadt-stadt, as you know, was a place where\nthey -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second holding place, holding pattern. Primarily people\nwho had certain privileges stay -- privileged status, and our status kind of held, and\ntherefore Westerbork was a place to -- transits, spot to get people out, and so we were\nthere in some sense too long, we didn\u2019t belong in Westerbork because we\u2019re not transit\npeople, and we were not transit to get transported, so they moved them to a new place,\nwhich -- Theresienstadt, which was designed for our kinds of people, all kinds of\nprivileged people. I had no idea that I was privileged obviously, but that settled in later.\nBut -- so I had no sense that that\u2019s a new regime, you know, for me. But my brother and\nsister were there, of course, must -- that must have been very reassuring, to have my\nbrother and sister with me on an ongoing basis. That was my anchor of family stability,\nand the rest was activities throughout the day, or evening. So when I was -- when we\nwere going to Terezin, we were put under the auspices of a social worker from\nAmsterdam, also was being shipped there with her husband, her name was Malka\nWeinmann, and her husband Paul Weinmann, who -- they placed some children under\ntheir responsibility. And we ended up in the train, which again I do remember the\nphysical feature of the train, 1t was a compar -- a European compartment train, was\nprobably third class, but it was not the cattle train, which people unfortunately were\nsubjected to as well. Was a commercial type of train with compartment, and we sat there,\nmy brother, my sister, myself, the two Weinmanns, two elderly people, Rosens, elderly\npeople, and another girl Alicia Farber, who was separated from her parents, so she was all\nalone as well. And we had this train trip to another place. And in the train, I was -- was\nprobably playing on the floor, with whatever we had over there, and Miss Malka\nPollaczek had a suitcase which I opened up, as a curious child would ordinarily do, and I\nplayed with whatever she had over there, I inspected it. And it was a big t-tin can there,\nand I asked her what is this all about, what is this for? And so she tells me, we\u2019 ll use that\nat happy occasion. Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my\nbrother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, close to -- to the following year. But that -- that scene of the train\nride I remember like a photograph, sitting there, and we moved onto -- from Westerbork\nto Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: Do you know how long it took?",
        "A: Several days, I believe.",
        "Q: And did they wein -- the Weinmanns have food that they brought with them, so that you\ncould eat?",
        "A: They brought some food, yes. They brought some food and provisions. And I assume -- I\nassume now that we also had our little bags -- people allowed to bring along one suitcase,\nor some bag or so. So whatever we had -- what it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor\ndoes my brother really remember. I asked him. But people had their belongings. And\nwhen we came to Theresienstadt, we were placed with the Dutch population. They was s-\nsegmented, they compartmentalized the people. Sometimes different groups met all\nacross th-the borders, in some sense, but we were among the Dutch. That again, in\nretrospect most probably helped because again, Dutch language was the language we sp -\n- | heard, and people spoke. Not that we knew people -- I don\u2019t think we knew many\npeople over there, but some -- turned out we had some relatives of my mother as well,\nwhom we dealt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our\nguardian, Malka Pollaczek. And she, in fact, was put in charge of the children\u2019s home in\nTerezin as well, which came to my advantage later. The Dutch compound, we were put in\nthe caserne, that -- not -- not barracks, barracks were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty\nimpressive stone buildings with courtyards, and surrounding were -- originally were\nmade for quarters for soldiers. And they used it for the people who were put into\nTheresienstadt, in detention purposes, and they multiplied the number of people in the --\nthose casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded. Had three\ntiers, beds -- three bunk beds. And men were separated from the women. And I now went\nwith my brother, and my sister was -- what -- was accessible, I went to visit my sister.",
        "Q: She was in a different place?",
        "A: Also in the same Hamborg caserne, that\u2019s where the Dutch were. And they were\n[indecipherable] pretty impressive stone structures. And in that respect you look at it\nnow, it looks like, you know with the courtyard, with kind of tiered, round hallways. But\nall of that was very crowded, and not very, you know attractive. But people always say\nthat Terezin is an attractive place compared with the other concentration camps, and\nthey\u2019re absolutely correct in that respect, but it\u2019s not a place recommend for a vacation.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or for a pleasant journey. It was -- had it\u2019s own drabness all the time, of the stench and\nthe physical environment. So again, I do see a visi -- a vision of a -- of the scene of brown\nwooden bunk beds, three tiers, and lots of people, and crowded, and noisy. But it was not\na calm environment. Bedbugs, lice on the beds, killing at night was an activity, you know\nto s-swipe them, do away with them. And then had get -- got a new routine in Terezin.\nNow, Terezin I remember a little bit more, because I was older, so I have more mental\nimages of Terezin. In ret -- in comparison to everything else, it was spacious. Was --\nokay? Because you had these big courtyards, and then from caserne to caserne there was\nanother walkway, and when you moved down from there -- there I did walk outside of\nthe caserne for a reason I\u2019Il tell you in a minute. So you had a sense of not being totally\nconfined to one building, or one narrow area. And that kind of tri -- helped the physical\nbenefit from being that -- not [indecipherable] confined. But it wa -- once you\u2019re in the\nbarracks, it was very crowded. But I was basically confined to that quarters for line-up,\nfor soup, for the meals, and for daily activity. And the learning study group I mentioned\nbefore, the study group was up in that loft, up to the left, if I recall correctly, where we --\nI went on a basis. So I didn\u2019t, again, wander around much till later in Terezin. And a lot\nof the parts of Terezin I never stepped across, because I had no business to be there. I\nmay not even allowed to be there for all I know. So you stuck where you belonged, and\nwhere I had some reason to be. And my reasons to be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the\nstudy place, the first stage of my stay there. And spent the time there.",
        "Q: Let me go back for a moment. Do you remember your arrival in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: We had to walk a long distance from the train. Later, I think they extended the train\ntracks, because when -- eventually right outside of Hamborg caserne, there was a fence,\nand the train tracks that was visible to my -- later on I saw people come and go, those\n[indecipherable] my activities during the day. But I don\u2019t think in our time we got that\nclose. We had to walk, I think a half an hour [indecipherable] what. But there was a\nparade of people marching, and I followed the crowd, and I moved along, and my legs\nheld up, and that was it. So it didn\u2019t leave as an impression of a torturous rite. I don\u2019t\nknow what id -- had no idea what I was in for. See, adults in all likelihood have more\nuncertainties and more concerns for -- they knew who they left behind, what they left\nbehind, rumors, all of that. So they\u2019re walking with a different attitude that I -- I was a\nchild again, not -- be -- being protected and being ignorant helped. So I walked. But I did\nnot, you know, find that, you know, gruesome or onerous. I may have been tired, as a\nchild, but moved along, you know. I was prodded along, and that was it. So I -- that part,\nin some sense I skipped easier than settling into the place.",
        "Q: Was there a registration process at --",
        "A: There was a registration process, which I don\u2019t recall being involved, maybe Miss Malka\nPollaczek took care of, maybe my brother took care of it. Vaguely I recall something,\nstanding on lines. Lot of line standing in Terezin in general. Lining for food, was a line\nalways. Morning line-up sometimes. Evening I think also. So there were lines, so -- but at\nthe -- the registration p -- part, again I -- I -- being a child, you -- I take it for granted you\nstand in line, or you do it, what you were told to do, so -- so it never left a big impact on\nme, or impression, as other people find that -- was very cold when we arrived in\nFebruary. And again, as I mentioned, for how we survived overall cold with inadequate\nclothing, in all likelihood, pretty impressive. Course I went -- we visited in 1996, Terezin,\nwas also February, by chance, and was bitter, bitter cold with a winter jacket, and with\ngloves and a scarf. And tell my wife that not see how I could have done that so many\nyears before, but I did.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did you see any brutality when you first arrived? Were people screaming?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no --",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall anything like that.",
        "Q: So while it was crowded, it was not a hysterical scene to you.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall any of that, I mean I don\u2019t know whether there was or\nthere wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, I mean I can\u2019t be a witness for that. I more recall was the daily routine.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The food line-up, I recall. All of us had a ration card for the month, and each of us had a\nlittle metal bowl and a spoon. How I, as a young child in 1944, held onto that without\nlosing it -- I believe I didn\u2019t lose it, I still wonder. Because nowadays a lot of school kids\ncan\u2019t keep their lunch card for one day, or other tickets, or so, and that mu -- mean -- it\nwas [indecipherable] my survival. In order to get food you need the bowl, you need the\ncard. And I never lost the card.",
        "Q: Where -- where would you put the bowl? Did you tie it on a belt or something, or you\ndon\u2019t know?",
        "A: Carried it with me, or put it back in the barrack when I wa -- was through.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But I have again these images of walking around at the -- at the serving time, with a\nspoon and a bowl, and lining up. And there was a strategy of where to line up, and when\nto line up, because the main meal often contained like a barley soup. And if you came\nearly you got the water, if you came at the end you got nothing. If you want to get water\nand barley, which had the most substance, you had to be positioned in the right time of\nyour line-up, the people positioned themselves, and I recall always people jockeying for\nposition where to go, partly because of what you get. And I was part of that jockeying.",
        "Q: And you knew that?",
        "A: I sensed it, yeah, I knew this, I knew that, I was [indecipherable] to become -- after\nawhile I become streetwise. And I was again told -- but that was part of my job, to be\nthere on time, at the right time, the right place to get a better serving. There were times I\ncame late. There were times I came too early. But every can\u2019t be in the middle,\nobviously. But that whole -- not tension, that whole -- at -- at -- attention, too, and focus\non getting your food or so, became part of your daily routine.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, have your bowl and have your food and have your line-up. Like it was a time\nconsuming affair through three times --",
        "Q: And what -- what did this ration card look like? Did y -- did someone cl -- clip off --",
        "A: Clipped off a piece -- I think they were --",
        "Q: They clipped off a piece?",
        "A: Yes, piece of paper I think that little sections to --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- to clip [indecipherable] make it 90 little coupons, and took -- each day took three.",
        "Q: And did you get the soup outside, or inside?",
        "A: Outside, outside.",
        "Q: It was outside --",
        "A: In the courtyard.",
        "Q: -- and you ate -- and you ate outside.",
        "A: I think ate outside, and sometimes inside. But they out -- the courtyard was it -- a place\nwhere again, you saw [indecipherable] one photograph, that was the kind of scene you\ncould remember. All Jewish people in -- interned people who were there, with coats and\nthe star on their jackets were serving the food, and then [indecipherable] people who\nknew who you were, you know? And it was a daily routine. The food wasn\u2019t very much\nfood to eat. With black bread, with cok -- grain coffee called ersatz coffee, which kids got\ntoo. The barley soup, several times a week there was horsemeat, and vegetables. Now,\none vegetable which lasted for me after the war, as well as a -- we called a\n[indecipherable] initially, 1s a -- something which young people don\u2019t know, now we call\nthem green beans, but they were used to call string beans. Now, string beans had a lot of\nstrings in the one they served. You ate, and you had your mouth, basically you had the\nfeel of those greens, whatever you got, and then the mouth full of these strings, which\nyou couldn\u2019t chew, you couldn\u2019t digest, and you spit them out, or so [indecipherable].\nThat was my concept of eating string beans. So after the war, when it was served, I\ncouldn\u2019t eat them for awhile. Because they also, still in 40\u2019s, they still had some strings,\nnot as much string or so. So that was the kind of food, was not very wholesome, but it\nkept me going.",
        "Q: Were you hungry? Do you remember being -- feeling hungry?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall feeling hungry, but was pretty standardized meal, no, you know, special\nfeatures.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Pretty routine, but you went -- that was, again, became the norm, and you -- you took\nwhat you got and you went on line in order to get your food, that was -- you came every\nday, you ate this, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- your rations were adequate enough to keep going. I wasn\u2019t working, so I was kind of,\nyou know, wandering around most of the day. And -- but the -- the food item was an\nimportant part of the day. And having protect your bowl and your ration coupon was an\noccupation, apparently.",
        "Q: Did your brother work?",
        "A: My brother did --",
        "Q: Was he old enough?",
        "A: -- he was old enough, he was put in some work activity, like messenger.",
        "Q: Really? Uh-huh.",
        "A: He served as a messenger. Deliver internal -- they had -- see, Terezin was organized as a\nfunctioning concentration camp with certain activities, with some semblances of\nnormalcy, and the -- again, the Jewish council had to administer a law from the detail, not\nthe [indecipherable] principles, and people were assigned work, and were assigned to do\ncertain activities. So my brother did work as a messenger, kept him busy, but I basically\nwandered around the camp.",
        "Q: Your sister, too?",
        "A: My sister a little less, I think also -- she also did. My recollection is that, you know, I\nplayed soccer with a tin can, that was my toy, kick the tin can. That was really my\noutdoor activity. This woman, Malka Pollaczek -- Malka -- married [indecipherable]\nPollaczek, Malka Weinmann was moved to administer a children\u2019s home in relatively\nnice quarters, in fact, was one very attractive building that they converted to a home for\nchildren, and she was the administrator for it. And after she moved to that place, she\nfound the means to bring me to that place as well if I wanted to, or -- or so. Of course it\nwas a little better condition, better food they served, lard as part a supplement of the food.\nWhere there was [indecipherable] only for children, as we were, loose children at the\nchildren\u2019s home. And given that we ate kosher, we -- I remember we had a discussion,\nmy brother, my sister and I, whether I should go to that home and -- because the\nattraction was eating lard. And so first of all, I -- I di -- wasn\u2019t eager to separate anyhow,\nbut that [indecipherable] she approached and she thinks it\u2019s good for me, I\u2019 Il be better\noff, nicer physical environment and better food, that [indecipherable] my interest, so we\nconsulted a rabbi, the rabbi said yes, go ahead, under the circumstances. Go there and eat\nthere, because you have a better chance of survival. So in answer to your question,\nwhether the food was ample, it really was a consideration for me to get better food, with\nmy interest, or so. So I moved to the children\u2019s home quarters, and -- but I did go visit my\nbrothers. That was further away from Hamborg caserne, so I had to cross over one -- a\nbig courtyard to get from here to there, and I wandered during the day, whenever I felt\nlike, or [indecipherable] it is. So I had had more space than before, and I did wi -- as a\nfunctional walk, I didn\u2019t explore the town, or so. So life moved on, and --",
        "Q: Can I ask you something?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Since you were religious --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and as a kid you understood that --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did it bother you to have the non-kosher food, I mean that it star --",
        "A: Yes, yes --",
        "Q: -- it both -- it bothered you when you were -- didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these camps,\nalthough the food was not prepared under kosher auspices, ate what they could eat, which\nwas not -- definitively not kosher like. Pig meat if they had given it, or horsemeat, or this\nsort. So -- and all I could do then, eat the horsemeat. I mean, the soup may have had\nhorsemeat content in there, but it\u2019s -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be\neaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, so it became a issue. That\u2019s why I had to -\n- we had to debate it, or discuss it. And I remember that discussion [indecipherable] no,\nof what should we do, and then we consulted the local rabbi over there, and\n[indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me a ruling that it\u2019s permissible, and I should go,\nand it\u2019s in my interest to do so. So I knew enough about that as well, my brothers knew\nmore -- my brother knew more, my sister knew more. So it became a legitimate\ndiscussion issue, but --",
        "Q: Maybe I didn\u2019t ask the question in a way that was understandable. I meant when you\nactually ate there.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Did that bother you, or did you say since they said it was okay --",
        "A: After awhile -- no, after awhile -- but no, after awhile it was okay, yes.",
        "Q: -- after it was okay -- it was okay.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t think I had a great abhorrence. And most probably kids don\u2019t really know\nwhat they\u2019re eating anyhow, once it\u2019s served.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, the issue was the underlying principle.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You know, so no, that. I\u2019m sorry, that was your question. I did not sense it was, you\nknow, just didn\u2019t taste good, or th -- I didn\u2019t put up a battle subsequently of saying no, I\ndon\u2019t, that\u2019s not for me.",
        "Q: No. Did you know that people were being transported out of Terezin?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very close -- lived. We were associated very close\nto the transport. Outside there was a big fence, a metal fence, and a major part of the day\nI spent around that fence watching the activity of the train depot. A lot of them -- the\narrivals I saw. And when the arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not\nonly I, other people standing over there, where they from? Cause sometimes they came\nfrom towns close by. Or from relatives they had, even if they\u2019re from a dif -- different\ncountry. So that people were identified, and the Czech group came in, so the people said,\noh not for me, I don\u2019t know anybody. Or the Danish came, late at the end of the thing,\nsame story. So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some you knew, so that\nthis came a discussion point, and people tried to see whether they knew anybody. And\nthey came from Holland, it was a big excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults\nmet acquaintances, or even relatives, and I was part of the -- the watching scenery and\ntaking it in, but not -- no -- I had met -- I never met -- met anybody who I knew,\nobviously, or anybody who was look -- looking for me. Although subsequently I have to\nmention to you, some distant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had\ncontact with them. So the [indecipherable] contact with us, obviously. Did I know people\nwere leaving? I saw transports too, but what 1t meant -- you see, two way traffic, all\nright? But the injection of new coming -- I did sense, of the people with whom I dealt\nwith, that they weren\u2019t there any more after awhile. So there was a [indecipherable]\nwhether people made friendships or so, it\u2019s different -- different friendships with people\nare there for two months, or three months, and fending for themselves, and then they\ndisappear. You become acquaintance, and then you know somebody\u2019s name, and\nsuddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, and he is no longer there. I had that sense\nof coming, going, people moving in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no\nidea. Where they came from was the curiosity to be discovered. And 1n line-ups -- in the\ntime of day we had line-ups, the different groups lined up near the fences, so that\nconversations started taking place, and you started picking up, you know, different\nlanguages.

But\nthere as a lot of interact -- not lot, there was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how\nlong it took to wait, and we saw different nationalities, and different languages, and kind\nof came [indecipherable] curious what was going on. So there was more -- I think the\narrivals left a bigger impact on me than the departures, because I had no idea where\npeople are going. I knew where they came from. And you -- suddenly you sit next to the\nDanes, and you sit next to the Hungarians when they came at the end. But we were not\nallowed to mix, and we -- there really was a fence between the nationalities, unless they\nput them in the same caserne. So I became more aware of the change of population of\nWesterbork over time, but the immediate group of people whom -- who I deal with, my\nbrother and my sister, Malka Weinmann and her husband, midway were shipped out to\nAuschwitz, cause she was more Dutch, and he was more -- he was Czech originally. So\nthey categorized him, he came under her auspices, and she had other potential\n[indecipherable] I\u2019m not clear why she survived, but she did. Anyway, that part I -- that\none part of the middle of our stay, he was shipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of\nhave a image of her being sad for one period of there, but could have been anything, or\nso, but later on she told me it was -- what was happening.",

        "A: That\u2019s o -- that was before --",
        "Q: Before you came, right, right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] came. See, there was a whole group of people who -- particularly the\nCzech young people who lived in some of these children\u2019s homes, they were arriving, I\nthink, in \u00b043, and then they were sent out to Auschwitz --",

        "Q: No?",
        "A: Remarkably, remarkably, no.",

        "A: All three of us. I asked my brother recently again, any of us were serious ill. In fact, one\nquestion which occurred to me, which I don\u2019t know why I started school in 1942, when I\nwas seven, whether that was the norm in Holland or not. So my brother didn\u2019t know\nexactly, but he says, when you were a child, you had frequent whooping cough, so maybe\nour parents protected you more or so. I suspect that the schools start at the age of seven,\nand we\u2019ve had an extended kindergarten. The schools don\u2019t always start that early --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: -- in -- in -- in Europe or so. But anyhow, we talked about that, and to our pleasant\nsurprises, we were not sick of physical si -- illness, you know, I mean, requiring\ninfirmary, or --",

        "Q: So really very small.",

        "A: Whether they were sick, or in -- or wensh -- went elsewhere, di-didn\u2019t know, penetrated,\nand I wasn\u2019t focusing attention on this kind of thing. But personally, remarkably enough\nwe didn\u2019t get sick, not in Westerbork, not in --",
        "Q: Not in Terezin.",
        "A: Not Terezin.",

        "Q: Did you get ho -- how do you be -- how were you treated -- as a little child there\u2019s a lot of\ntouching that goes on with children, being hugged, and being touched, and whatever. Di -\n- did you get that? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: I received that from Malka Weinmann.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes. She was attentive to me, and matter of fact she took me into the -- her orbit, direct\norbit. I perce -- now, I was paid attention, I had access to her, and vaguely I recall once or\ntwice, and I came to her with some kind of complaint or so, and soothed my feelings or\nso. So I had that, it was not the -- she had a lot of children to take care of, and she was not\n-- in general she\u2019s not a touchy -- was not a touchy person, was a very professional\nwoman, very capable, and very caring. But to go and, you know, hug every little child\nunder her care, she couldn\u2019t probably do her job, or --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or so. So I, did I lack that? Most probably I -- I -- did I miss it? Again, I di -- those --\nthose were my circumsta -- I mean, I was both accepting, and not knowing any better.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. I just -- I appear to have adjusted to the circumstances, and I moved with the tide.",
        "Q: Right. Which was lucky, I suppose.",
        "A: Which was lucky, yes.",
        "Q: Ho -- how would you describe your relationship with Leah, and with Leo? Did you talk,\ndid you play?",
        "A: We talked, no, we were in conta -- I ta -- I mentioned I c-come -- gravitated back to them",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- or so. We were a threesome, okay? And related to each other. One illustration, which in\nfact is under, quote, dispute amongst us, and both stories may well be correct, by the way,\nbecause what we each remember is something different. For -- my recollection of the\nstory is that for Passover, for Pessach, for the Seder time, we knew that Passover is\ncoming around, cause we\u2019re taught in the group, we -- Leo and I --that\u2019s -- I recall, my\nbrother confirms that after I recall it, saved our potato rations, and we ground it up\nsomehow, and gave it to her to make matzoh. She does not recall that. She recalls\nsomething different, that Leo and I saved our potato rations and made a birthday cake for\nher. And I say both may well be right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay, we don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Or you may be talking about two different times even.",
        "A: Or two different times even, or so. But that\u2019s the kind we -- and we dealt with each other\nas a li -- if you ask me as a illustration, well, we came -- she was -- kind of took care of\nthe household things.",
        "Q: Leah did.",
        "A: Le -- yeah, li -- li -- call her Lily.",
        "Q: Lily?",
        "A: Lily. That\u2019s her other -- that\u2019s her -- that\u2019s her name we know of her -- Leah 1s her formal\nname, and now in Israel she\u2019s -- calls herself Leah as well to other people, but Lily is her",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- common name, mean, as a family, people know Lily. But so we had ongoing, you\nknow, relationships, and contact. And most probably played whatever children play. But\nshe again had her tasks, and my brother had his tasks, and I was separated from them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So the amount of contact was not as frequent and as ongoing as had we been all together.",
        "Q: Now I -- I know that you -- you didn\u2019t feel insecure in the way that an adult would there.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This was the place that you were at. But did you feel somehow more secure, more at\nhome when you\u2019d be with your brother and sister, that sa -- you -- do you have this --",
        "A: The mere fact that I gravitated to them --",
        "Q: Towards them.",
        "A: -- yes, obviously is the case, that I felt that was the know, -- I belonged with them --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and they could answer my questions, or deal with me, or whatever concerns I may have\nhad, don\u2019t recall the individual point, but I do recall walking regularly from the children\u2019s\nhome, which is separate building, to the caserne, and looking for them, and getting --\nmoving with them. So where that was, know, a stabilizing feature for me, or not, in the\nlikely, yes. But as a child I certainly don\u2019t recall that I was looking for, you know, a place\nwhere I had to be safe, and only with them or anybody else. Somehow I managed to roam\nthe streets, keep busy, the day passes, get my food, and do my things what I had to do,\nand keep out of trouble, whatever that meant, and function. That was my -- that was my\ndaily routine.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I did that day by day, with some guidance, with some supervision. But I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s as structured, as organized as people would like to see in retrospect --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that it was all orchestrated. That\u2019s how it worked out.",
        "Q: Now, how were your clothes washed, if they were washed? Do you -- do you know?",
        "A: I think my sister did some of it, and they washed infrequently, obviously.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Must -- things must have torn. Again, the whole clothing for all of us --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- is not clear. I say -- I may have been the beneficiary again of my brothers, but how my\nbrother kept clothing, how I got it, he doesn\u2019t know either. But it happened.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they -- they were washed, and the total clothing collection, which was probably very\nmeager, and I don\u2019t recall what I wore, I don\u2019t recall the colors or patterns, or of this sort.\nLeft no impression that I didn\u2019t have or did have. I wa -- I was taken care of because I\nwas dressed. I wasn\u2019t walking around naked, or no -- barefoot. And again, Malka\nWeinmann may well have supervised that part for me too. So, in broad sense, my needs\nwere taken care of. As know, to survive to function.",
        "Q: Did you wash, did you take baths?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you smell?",
        "A: Showers.",
        "Q: You took showers?",
        "A: I think I took showers. I think I took showers, yes [indecipherable] there was no bathtubs.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I think I took showers. Did I smell? The whole --",
        "Q: Everybody smelled.",
        "A: Everybody, the whole place had a aroma, odor.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Heavy, and so they came -- and eventually people got used to that. So --",
        "Q: And bathrooms? Were there latrines?",
        "A: There were latrines, and public long -- long line bathrooms or so. Again, all these things\ndon\u2019t leave any impression on me, because it became routine. Whatever facilities were\nthere, I made use of.",
        "Q: You just [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. Whether they were foul compared to what could have been, obviously. But pose --\nmean -- remember, for a little child in \u201944, the last time I had normal bathroom facilities,\nwas go back in end of \u201942, beginning of 43, it\u2019s a long time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: After, I know, two years of not standard sanitary conditions, that becomes, in some sense,\nthe accepted norm.",
        "Q: Now was that similar in Westerbork for you?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: It was? They had latrines?",
        "A: Yes, yes, right. But it -- nothing to leave any kind of mental picture of it. When I visited\nTerezin, I saw in some of the places what they had, I kind of recollect on all these long\nlines. But only kind of re-emerged something ote -- which I took f -- that was it --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how one had to go to take care of one\u2019s needs, one took care of one\u2019s\nneeds using what was available.",
        "Q: And your recollection of the way people behaved is people were simply accepting, this is\nwhat was there, and this is what we have to do.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I her -- saw at yet -- but again, doesn\u2019t mean that was all --\nalways the case, but I was not involved with adult world too much. And the adult world I\nwas involved in dealt with me as a child.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So I am not a person that could kind of comment anything about that sort of thing.",
        "Q: Did you ever ask your brother, have you heard from our parents again?",
        "A: Not far as I recall.",
        "Q: Not as you recall.",
        "A: Recall, no",
        "Q: Or did you say wh-where are they?",
        "A: Where -- ask -- no, I don\u2019t recall that I raised this issue, whether 1t was on my mind. And\npart again is I think eventually I moved from transition to transition to a life circumstance\nthat was tolerable for a child. And again, I was not being hurt physically, I was not being\n-- didn\u2019t get sick or so. So I was not in pain, or some of this sort. May have cold, but\neverybody else was cold most probably, so it\u2019s cold. And somehow was accepting,\nadapting to it, and so stopped asking questions. My brother was much more alert, and\nmuch more troubled about all of this, but either protected me, or didn\u2019t consider me as an\noutlet. I have no idea where he [indecipherable] outlet for that matter. He may -- needed\noutlet more than I did, my brother.",
        "Q: So in some way your youth protected you.",
        "A: My youth protected me --",
        "Q: Every [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and this way my youth was treated with this -- these little -- being in these little\nchildren\u2019s enclaves, and children\u2019s homes kind of protected me one layer better than my\nsiblings did. I was more privileged treatment in some sense, than they had. He had to\nwork and fend for himself, and I was in this children\u2019s home. And it -- physically a more\nattractive place, I remember that, physically was with a balustrade stairway -- course th-\nthey took over a residential home, that\u2019s how th -- that\u2019s how they were built. I think --",
        "Q: Was [indecipherable] sa -- I\u2019m sorry, go on.",
        "A: -- no -- go ahead -- those -- no -- since it was an army camp before, and it was good as an\narmy camp, the commandanters, or the commanders, and all this sort had si -- elegant\nhomes, and that\u2019s where they eventually put the children. Right now the museum is in\none of those buildings, very elegant room. EI -- elegant st --",
        "Q: And did you remember --",
        "A: The physical building?",
        "Q: -- the physical building very well?",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: In fact, when I went to the museum, I thought it was -- that was the place where I was,\nbecause very similar stairway, and spatial. So, I mean, I -- I was not in no -- in total\nsqualid quarters, fortunately.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My brother and sister in the bunkbed areas were worse, I was there for awhile, I\nremember that, but you know, took it, and I moved onto another stage. I was very kind of\n-- not -- not in control of things, nor was I asking to be in control of things.",
        "Q: Right. Did your sister also eventually work?",
        "A: I believe she did some work, I don\u2019t recall exactly, no.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know what, right.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: Was there any delousing that you can remember, where they put powder on you, or\nsomething?",
        "A: I think there was delousing, we got chemicals odors periodically, was when the bugs and\nlice became more prevalent, they had delousing, yes. Then, that made life uncomfortable\non your bed as well, because had the odor and the residual --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- fu -- features, or so, the only feature was you saw dead bugs. I don\u2019t like bugs.",
        "Q: Do you remember being deloused?",
        "A: Personally, I think once or twice, yes I --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, did that hurt, I mean was it -- was it burning or some --",
        "A: I don\u2019t think no, no --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- | don\u2019t -- I recall as -- no, I don\u2019t recall the physical part of it. But I think the physical,\nthe barracks themselves were deloused.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Cause that\u2019s where they --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s where the lice were prevalent.",
        "Q: Were, right.",
        "A: So, sure that\u2019s not -- not pleasant or so. But it can it -- it came, and it went, and it came\nagain, perhaps. And that was part of the environment.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So not something to kind of leave a impact, or a imprint on me.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: As it would maybe on an adult, or a -- I wasn\u2019t fighting it either, you see, it wasn\u2019t a\nquestion that I wanted something better or different.",
        "Q: It -- in June of 1944, the Red Cross came, and they made this a lot -- certain portion of\nthe place look much, much different, and they call it a kind of potenkin viz -- village,\nbecause it was a -- a lie. Do you have any recollection of that happening?",
        "A: No. Partly I think -- you see, we arrived in end of February, and we were not veterans at\nthe time, this -- the -- these were planned, you know. June they came, but they planned it\nin advance. So all the pe -- the kids who they put in the kid shows, and the other items\nwere the fronts for the -- and props for these movies, must have been picked maybe\nMarch and April. I mean, you don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t do this stuff in June on June. So we kind\nof -- most probably came too late for that, so we were out of it. I don\u2019t recall any of this\nthing of a sort.",
        "Q: Nothing, uh-huh.",
        "A: And I think I would have, had I seen a play or a s -- a soccer match, or something -- this\nwas -- that\u2019s wha -- done the movie. I -- had I been one of the props --",
        "Q: Right, you would have remembered.",
        "A: -- I'd have remembered something.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And I think my brother neither. But I attributed that fact that we arrived when the\nplanning for this thing -- this must have been underway already, and we were out of\neligibility --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- for that kind of thing, so nor did we get the benefits, whatever benefits existed for the\nclean up of this sort.",
        "Q: Right, right. Di -- did you go to any cultural activities during the period of time you were\nin t -- Terezin?",
        "A: No, only this little kids, you know, study group, that\u2019s the cultural activity.",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: We did have my brother\u2019s bar-mitzvah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Oh yes. That\u2019s where the canned item --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- I mentioned to you, in f -- January, 1945 was his bar-mitzvah, and he was taught by\none of the rabbis to read the section of the Haftorah, and be called up to the Torah, and\nFriday night had a festive celebration where Malka Weinmann pulled out that can of\ncheese, Dutch cheese.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: That which she saved for that event. And she collected from other people some goodies\nthey had, chocolates and everything else. So it was a festive event. We did go to services,\nto synagogue on a weekly basis.",
        "Q: Oh, you did?",
        "A: Oh yes, was a synagogue service going on and so we were part of that little group of\npeople who went to services. And in fact my brother recently showed me that they had\nannouncement sheets, they -- the person who was organizing that service send out an\nannouncement to somebody else, be aware that next week or some of this sort, is the bar-\nmitzvah celebration of this young boy, Leo Sigmann, and make, know, announce it to\nwhoever it is, that will take place on Saturday morning.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And he has it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He has one of them?",
        "A: Well, by chance my brother, a complete fluke chance, he was walking home from\nsynagogue with some of his congregants in New York, and a fellow invited him come up\nhave -- have guests, and he didn\u2019t want to come up, and he did come up, and eventually\nthe person had inherited the diary -- had the -- all these announcements of the Jewish\ncommunity of Terezin, he had all of them, and he -- when he -- Leo mentioned to him\nthat he was in Terezin, didn\u2019t register. When he went back to it, he went looking through\nall these little notices, and he says, your name is listed in among those notices. I have a\ncopy of it here with me.",
        "Q: Is-Isn\u2019t that something?",
        "A: And so they have [indecipherable] the fact that he gave him a composite sheet of\ndifferent notices, which is just interesting enough that they had the -- there was a sense of\ncommunity, and belonging with different people. So that celebration I recall, and the can\n-- the can of cheese which she saved.",
        "Q: Was it good cheese?",
        "A: Yes, well, Dutch. Dutch cheese is good. And other treats for -- even if you don\u2019t have --\ndon\u2019t have treats on a routine basis, it tastes very different.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was the highlight of summer event. So it was not just the bar-mitzvah which most\nprobably, was also being commemorated was -- was [indecipherable] so people did\ncontinue doing their lifecycle events, or so, and what\u2019s even more interesting in his case,\nis that bar-mitzvah boys received tefillin, but where do you get tefillin in a camp? People\nhappened to have one set, not going to give it away, necessarily. Turns out that a Czech\nperson had two sets. One a traveling set, was this regular one, which he brought along, so\nhe gave it to my brother. Very, very small phylacteries. And typically, the ins -- writings\ninside the tefillin are in parchment, and the very small ones had to write very small\nletters. Typically, typically they are defective. It turns out that he had them inspected by a\nscribe, after -- he has them now, he had them inspected by a scribe after the war, in New\nYork, or -- or in Israel for that matter, and they were letter perfect.",
        "Q: Very odd.",
        "A: And the man was overwhelmed. And he told them where he came from [indecipherable]\nsomebody\u2019s been protecting it, or so. So he still has those.",
        "Q: Oh my. But we -- these small --",
        "A: Very tiny, very small ones.",
        "Q: Huh. Amazing.",
        "A: So life on -- this respect for life on religious sense went on, circumscribed by the\ncircumstances.",
        "Q: Did a lot of people go to synagogue? There must have been different synagogue groups,\nalways.",
        "A: Different [indecipherable] I can -- I would not know -- can\u2019t -- the totality I can\u2019t tell. We\nhad a synagogue -- well, a synagogue, a service place, it was an ongoing place, and we\nwent regularly. So all these places were relatively small physical space anyhow --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so they couldn\u2019t crowd many people in.",
        "Q: Right. And your sister went as well?",
        "A: I believe so. I believe so. Yes, I can\u2019t -- you know, but -- but it was ca -- it was an\nactivity, you know, we know Shabbat came, that -- that\u2019s what you do.",
        "Q: And that was what -- right. And you celebrated as many holidays as you could?",
        "A: We celebrated, because again we were taught of the holiday cycle, so we celebrated,\ncommemorated with -- within what we could, whether -- the one -- one episode I\nremember was about the matzoh making, okay?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But whether -- I don\u2019t recall a, you know, full fledged Seder, or so, myself, 1n detail, but\nit must have occurred. Or a -- a Seder must have occurred, right? So again I have these\nlittle glimpses, of course that one left an impression to me, that we did something, you\nknow, special. But the -- you know, s-some semblance of the calendar commemoration\ncontinued.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Part because of the education, and part because of the practice.",
        "Q: Now, this visa that you had to Honduras, but there was something about going to\nSwitzerland, am I correct, that you --",
        "A: Du -- the n -- no, there were they -- the visas were for Honduras, provided by our Swiss\nrelatives.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My s -- mother had a sister and brothers in Zurich, and they are the ones who mobilized -",
        "Q: To get the visas.",
        "A: -- to get those visas. But nat -- I believe at my father\u2019s behest, know, been begging and --\nbut -- and it came too late for my parents and two older brothers. So it had a Swiss\nassociation with it, but it\u2019s Honduran passports.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.",
        "A: That kept us in this category of treat them differently.",
        "Q: And that seemed to protect you throughout the whole period. Some -- or something\nprotected you.",
        "A: That of -- protect us from the -- of course, in Theresienstadt they had ongoing transports\nto Auschwitz as well, and Bergen-Belsen, and elsewhere. So we were never put in any of\nthe transports, because of that status, not because we were children, because they didn\u2019t\ndifferentiate, they put the children on there as well, plenty of them. But, at the end of the\nwar they had already in I think the fall of \u201944, they had after this propaganda episode, the\nRed Cross again had a deal with the Swiss people [indecipherable] Swiss authorities had\na deal for transporting people to stu -- Switzerland in exchange for trucks and tools, who\nknows what. And money, I think. So, a number of people were eligible to go, and rumors\nspread, or evers know, spread that pi -- that this was happening, people ought to be\nsigning up. And they had certain categories people who were eligible, and we cate --\nunder our categories we [indecipherable] because we had Swiss relatives maybe they\nthought my par -- my mother lives there, who knows what. Anyway, were eligible to go,\nand we were -- kind of suggested we could go. So we consulted with different people,\nincluding these other relatives of my mother, which was -- and there was a lot of\nsuspicion, and our name was not put on that train. Must have been in the fall of \u201944.\nPeople had arrangements, see th -- whoever was suspicious had arrangement of giving\nback mailings with codes of -- if it 1s correct, they write -- some words, or some style, or\nwhat have you. If it\u2019s not correct, they would do something different. When the letters\ncame back, they actually came from Switzerland, the packages were sent from\nSwitzerland, so that train of, I think 11 -- 1200 people left, and I -- my brother and sister\ncould have been on that train, but we missed the bo -- train.",
        "Q: You missed the boat.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But subsequently, they had similar types of announcements, and some the -- some went\nactually to Auschwitz directly. They were told they\u2019re going somewhere else. We were\nnot eld -- we -- eligible because [indecipherable] workers, had to be of working age, at\nleast I wasn\u2019t, and so we\u2019re not eligible. But in \u201945, there was another opportunity if you\nwere going to Swiss tr -- [indecipherable] or -- or Freedom train, and for that one we\nwere eligible, and we did sign up. Now, that train never left, but ne -- wer -- there -- was\ndestined to go to a gas chamber. Many people don\u2019t know that, Theresienstadt had a gas\nchamber, but Terezin does -- fortunately it was never used, cause they wanted to save the\ntravel time and distance of the trains, for that time they wanted to use the trains for their\nown war purposes, or [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you hear about that then?",
        "A: What, about the train going to tre -- to gas chambers?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: After the war we discovered.",
        "Q: No, I mean, that there -- that they were supposed to be building the gas chamber, and --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t. This you heard after the war.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s true [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But that train never left, because the war is coming to it\u2019s end, but that -- the plan of the\nNazis was to have that train go to the -- very close by. And it was th -- but the foil was,\nlet\u2019s say, the Swiss Freedom train. So we were saved once more by --",
        "Q: Right. There was a train to Switzerland in 1945 with about 1200 people --",

        "A: May -- may -- maybe jan -- maybe January, February, could be. That\u2019s the one we were\nnot.",
        "Q: I see, that was one --",
        "A: Which means that we did not sign on.",
        "Q: I see, right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the dates exactly.",
        "Q: Right. Okay. We have to take a break.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Sorry th --\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Charles, do you -- you were liberated in May, and you didn\u2019t take this second -- or at\nleast we think it may be the second transport to -- to Switzerland. That was going to go in\nMarch or April, you think?",
        "A: Around that time, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So is -- is anything ch --",
        "A: That was an aborted trip, it never -- that never took off.",
        "Q: It never took off, so no one went on it.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Did anything change radically in -- in those few months before the liberation?",
        "A: Well yes, there was much more movement of trains, and so much more activity.",
        "Q: You mean in and out?",
        "A: In and out, yeah, right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And towards the end of the war -- and I lose -- I\u2019d -- nobody -- I mean, I still didn\u2019t know\nthe calendar date, whether was mar -- February, March, to me it was the winter, who\nknows, but I don\u2019t associate with particular months or dates. But towards the end, since I\nhung around that fence at the -- near th -- near the railroad, watching the railroad tracks\non one side, and the movement of activity on the other side, there were ki -- more and\nmore people were standing around, and they were kind of coming instant war reporting\ncommentators, because by the sound of where certain cannons went off, or airplanes were\nflying, they were able to tell, or the -- they thought they could tell whether it\u2019s the allied\nforces or whether they were the Germans. And as a standee next to that fence, I was kind\nof coming -- hearing about, know, the forces against the Nazis are coming closer to here.\nAnd that came -- gave momentum as the days increased, whether -- was -- must have\nbeen April I assume, or so, but I can tell. Also we saw German trucks moving out\ndifferent kind of German soldiers, w-we had [indecipherable] with the German soldiers,\nbut there was more movement of people [indecipherable] going and -- and kind of what\nyou found out after that they were regrouping and escaping. And more people were\nhanging around that fence rather than working, wherever they was doing. So there was a\nvery different atmosphere towards the end of the war than before. That was the most\nnoticeable part, and this -- listening to these comments of -- they\u2019re coming, they\u2019re not,\nthey\u2019re further away, closer by, and judging of a sort, I got a sense that -- wh -- since I\nthen knew right -- it was a war, everything else, that this war 1s now reaching a different\nstage. So that was very much in the atmosphere, in the air, and the conversation, and I\nwas there listening --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and absorbing, and most probably even parroting what was happening. Different kinds\nof transports came the end, I think the Danes and the Hungarians came pretty late in the\ngame. And -- kind of -- so new people, you never heard -- you -- heard before. The Danes\ncame very late. So new languages, but the -- and they were different appearance, too.\nNow, turns out that Theresienstadt also got a whole group of people from the death\nmarches, were -- ended up in Theresienstadt, but they never ended up to our place, they\nended up in -- that\u2019s why people ask me about, do you ever meet those people, no. Matter\nof fact, I know now some people who says they were in Theresienstadt at liberation. And\ntheir description of what they saw was very different than what I lived. But they lived in\nthe small compound, away from where we were anyhow -- not that -- not\n[indecipherable] I\u2019ve seen everybody, but I would have [indecipherable] I seen coming\nin, I would have seen very different type of person coming in, straggling in, decimated\npeople. We didn\u2019t see those people, although we were liberated the same day --",
        "Q: Same day.",
        "A: -- or so. So anyway, the momentum that\u2019s -- the scene was changing, the war scene was\nchanging was evident, and was part of the discussion. And that I do recall being there,\nparticipating, absorbing. On again, on a daily, incremental basis. By the end of it, you\nknow what was happening. And I recall the final days or so where the troops of the\nGerman Nazis were leaving, and for good luck threw hand grenades over the fence for us,\nfor now a gift to us, who ducked and moved on. But that\u2019s already before we got it, that\u2019s\na good sign, because they\u2019re good-bye, and good riddance. So that was the approach\ntowards the end of the war which changed the mood. I think a lot of people -- and again I\ncapture that indirectly being -- being there. Right, I know exactly the details of what was\nhappening.",
        "Q: I -- I just -- as you were talking I realized that I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t ask you when did you\nrealize there was a war going on?",

        "A: Right? And that\u2019s y-you hear people talking. You overhear, so at -- at \u201944, when I was\neight plus, I was kind of understanding a little bit more about war, sides, Nazis, Germany,\nothers. People in -- when they lined up, and they had different -- [indecipherable] I\noverheard conversations, but I was part of it, eventually starts some [indecipherable] so I\nunderstood there was a war, and the Jews were targets and victims, because obviously we\nwere -- most of them were Jews, okay? And I hung around s -- the synagogues, so --",
        "Q: You hear a lot.",
        "A: You hear -- hear this kind of s-story. Whether I knew all the sophisticated details --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or not -- that\u2019s irrelevant, but I knew there was a war, and I knew things were now\nsuddenly being changed. One side was losing, one side is gaining. What it meant being,\nyou know, who da -- who decides where -- obviously I was not fully in command of that,\nwhether it was allied troops, or even the names of it, but that -- but there was a -- the\nNazis, or the Germans, basically, versus other people, and that there\u2019s a battle going on,\nand you know, you heard these reports about the airplanes flying, and sounds of bangs\nand booms, and people interpreting all of that, I -- I started ab-absorbing that, over time.\nIt wasn\u2019t a one day event either, remember --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- it was several weeks of time. And I -- again, the fact there were more people at the\nfence than before, I didn\u2019t know why, but it was a changed feature a-as well. So that\u2019s\nhow I kind of participated in the approach of liberation.",
        "Q: When you started learning more, realizing that there\u2019s a war, and hearing the guns, and\nsomebody saying that the Nazis are doing things to the Jews -- wh -- however you heard\nit, did you start getting afraid then, or --",
        "A: No, it came in a good time, because it was th --",
        "Q: Because it was at the end?",
        "A: It was the end, and people are saying we\u2019re winning, or you know, we\u2019re going to be\nfreed.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: So no -- no time for fear.",
        "A: Well, not no time for fear, just not -- was again, was n-not the highlight of what I was\nkind of taking in. I was taking in about some war, and one side is going to lose, and these\nguys are going to get it, and they\u2019re leaving, walking away -- way -- when people saw\nthese trucks, or whatever it was, with [indecipherable] German soldiers running, the\ncommentary was they\u2019re surrendering, they\u2019re escaping, they\u2019re doing something. Well,\nthen you sense that these people, the bad people are going out of your life, you know? It\nwas not that dif -- kind of fear more than had it occurred in \u201943, or \u201944, when it was the\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Now, is there a period of time between when the Germans leave, and the Russians come,\nwhen it\u2019s just all of you inmates in Terezin?",
        "A: There was a short period, but again, only --",
        "Q: Not in --",
        "A: Not -- not -- again, it wasn\u2019t identified to me as a new period of, know, freedom or so. I\nonly sensed it by the number of people at that fence.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That was growing, growing, more people were there. People hanging around. And you\nhear this [indecipherable] you know, we being -- going to be freed. You understood what\nwas happening, that end was coming. And then, see these mass, you know, departures, it\nalso was consistent. So now the people -- question of when will [indecipherable] people\nmost probably listen to some kind of radio or other features, then they -- that\u2019s -- word\nspread amongst each other. I was obviously not party to that. And -- but it sounded more\nreal that what other people were talking about, and I kind of integrated that into my\nabsorption, whatever I was thinking.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You have to re-recollect that when I child hears things, it is not all as logical as what\u2019s\nbeing presented, or as totally comprehensible. But they ab -- do absorb a change of tone,\na change of discussion topics, and that\u2019s what I was capturing.",
        "Q: Right. Did food change? Did you still ge -- you still ate in the way you had before?",
        "A: Same.",
        "Q: Same.",
        "A: As far as I\u2019m aware, the same. Not aware of any change.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember the Russians when they came?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: What was it like?",
        "A: First of all, they came and obviously jubilant, you know. Was a -- and the people\nthemselves were kind of very excited and they handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and\nchocolates to people, I think to us, to kids, and in that respect they were very, quote, kind,\nand a breath of fresh air. Right? Soldiers who were friendly rather than soldiers who were\nguarding people who -- and people embraced them, and touched them, it was a different -\n- you saw that some whatever it was, new -- liberators, but that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s what they\nleft the impression. In that respect they were most pr -- most probably very good. I did\nknow, and I can see that image too, of rampaging through the barrack to the caserne of\nthe -- you know, where people were crowded, and ripping off watches of women. I saw\nthat scene, apparently they also pillaged and raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not\nobviously, but I just didn\u2019t see, or didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s later, but the\ngrabbing off watches of people who somehow managed to retain them during the war\nperiod is -- was very kind of shocking to me. But they di -- transformed very quickly, the\nrole of the being behind the fences versus being free, and more movement. I think the\nfence came down, or -- but we still had a fence, I remember was the -- suddenly you saw\nthe German soldiers, whoever the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in\nTheresienstadt were now being required to go with wheelbarrows and picking things up,\nand fixing things up, and breaking things down, and they were being beaten by some\nformer German people who ta -- trying to put -- change their roles in order to get more\nprivileges, and that was going on and people were cheering on and pointing out, you\nknow, hit them harder, etcetera, this sort, get even with them. So the -- again, that was a\nvery different atmosphere what you saw before. So that\u2019s the Russians kind of influence,\na very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before, and now they\nbecame -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis,\nor Germans, and Germans beating up their compatriots, or so, and with full vigor, I mean,\njust reversed direction. But that -- the transition from being occupied versus being\nliberated, and the change took [indecipherable] very, very quickly. And very noticeable,\nand to -- very quick. Now in May, the eighth, ninth, we were liberated, and by June\nalready we were out.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Now, a lot of people didn\u2019t make it to later. There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a\nquarantine, but the most typhus epidemic took place in that other quarter where these\nother people who were in the death marches who made it, barely made it, ended up. I\ndon\u2019t know whether in our particular compound, they did it by caserne to caserne, I don\u2019t\nknow what -- we were allowed to leave in June. Again, some people say you couldn\u2019t\nhave left in June because there was a general quarantine. Well, I know I left in June, you\nknow, I mean --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t care what the historian books say on that. People verif -- generalize from the\ngeneric fact, and apply it to everybody.",
        "Q: Right. So where did you all go? And -- and who -- was it Leo who made the decision",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after the war, there was a very st -- quick\neffort to identify, locate people who survived. And whoever did this, might -- the\nRussians, or others, made a list of the survivors in tha -- in Theresienstadt, and people\nfrom different localities contacted the authorities somewhere, that was designated, maybe\nRed Cross [indecipherable] I don\u2019t recall, obviously. And we had relatives who survived\nthe war in Holland, who were in hiding during the war, in the broadest [indecipherable]\nwere kind of somewhat distant, but in the context of the time they very close to my\nfamily, partly they\u2019re -- they were raised in the old country, very close in the same\ncourtyard, effectively, so they were like very close cousins, brother, sister type\nrelationship. Anyhow, that relative knew that, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch\nrelatives they had, and went around finding out in Westerbork most probably, with the\nDutch authorities, where are the S-Sigmann family, my parents, my brothers and my\nsister and myself. And eventually they found out that the only ones who are surviving\nfrom their records was us three. And they got in touch with the Theresienstadt people,\nwho went and got in touch with Malka Weinmann, and through us, and saying, oh, yo-\nyou will come back, you have a place to go -- the people who were released from these\ncamps had a -- a place to go. We had a place to go because somebody was claiming us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Had we not had that we would have been again, rerouted somewhere to a displaced\npersons camp, or hang around later in Theresienstadt, I don\u2019t know what would have\nhappened. But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come\nto them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber,\nwhose parents survived. So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were\nclaiming her. So we all went back on the train from Terezin to the American section, you\nknow, Czechoslovakia kind of was split into different regions whoever liberated them.\nOne half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think. And we\ntook a train from Terezin to Pilsen, and maybe took a plane from Pilsen to Amsterdam, I\nthink a French plane, was probably a army transport plane. And we stayed a few days or\nso with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her. And you ask what attachment,\nthat was probably -- I -- we sensed that. And well, a very different life suddenly, you\nknow, plates, and tables, and food that we never had eaten before. White bread was\nserved, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread. I had a tin can of anchovy\npaste, I don\u2019t know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little\nthing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips. Spent a few\ndays over there, till they discussed with -- how to get us to these relatives, the Bergers,\nwho themselves spent the war years separated from their children, daughter and son. The\ndaughter, son and parents were in three different locations, and they were --",
        "Q: And they all survived?",
        "A: They survived, yes, they survived. And then I rejoined living with them after, for one\nyear or so, till other family members elsewhere in the world started looking for the\nSigmann family, and locating us, and discovered we were the only survivors. So we spent\na year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- from June to July, or June of ni -- June to\nJune, from \u00b045 to 46, and being -- lived in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: And how was that for you?",
        "A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they\nthemselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their\nlife. So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what\npeople were used to. I mean, s-sitting at a table with the family rather than in a\ncompound. Cooking, baking, washing. You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were\nhidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in Indonesia before, and I think\nthey lived at Amsterdam. And they lived behind a partition wall for several years.\nCouldn\u2019t go out in daytime. Didn\u2019t know where their daughter and son was -- were. Their\ndaughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a\nquote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of Amsterdam\nas a open house help, au pair. It\u2019s -- her name is Miriam. And she was there, and -- very\ninteresting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and\neach one has his own tale of escape and saving. But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have\nbeen around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people\nwere very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com\n-- can\u2019t do anything on a Sunday. That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on\nSaturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath. But they were very\ndevout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too. They --\nin order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their\nown children, so they couldn\u2019t say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the\nvery devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays,\nto keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh\n-- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us\nabout, it was kind of -- and they\u2019re very nice people. We met them after they came, they\nwere very close. But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what\nthey went through, was both interesting, and it was very common. Their son, who was a\ntall fellow, was in hiding in a little attic, in a little town up in -- in the country, again\ndidn\u2019t see daylight, public daylight for several years. And he was an artist and he made\nwooden pins for the underground, emblems. I believe that\u2019s how he spent his time. And\nso the reconstituting of life in Amsterdam was -- we were part of it, but we\n[indecipherable] we were visiting. These Bergers are interesting people because they used\nto have a restaurant, kosher restaurant in Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently,\nbefore the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their\napartment was gone, all their belongings were gone. They couldn\u2019t -- they knew who they\ngave it, they couldn\u2019t get it back, even because they survived. People denied, apparently\nthat they had received anything. They had to start from scratch, in very small quarters, we\nlived in very, very small quarters. There was no shower or bathtub in the house. We had a\nlittle metal bathtub that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most\nprobably too, and we went to public baths. This was the life. But for them it was a --\nhappy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through,\nand remember that. Of course they would -- had the restaurant before, they\u2019re still -- so\nthey\u2019re getting the old customers coming back, come and eat. Some widowers, or single\npeople, lost their family. So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served\nthings. Whether they paid or not, I don\u2019t know. But they kind of resumed the sort of role\n[indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the\ntable. You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now\nwe had one experience, people had very different experience. The hiding, some survived,\nbut only, you know, one person. And some people were traumatized, and completely\ntroubled. And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to\ntalk or his despair -- despair. And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really --\nwhen that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the room, the small\nquarters. And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. So those kind of\nthings, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in Amsterdam, it was --\nit was not a normal return to life, again. These people, the Bergers, at this restaurant, also\nkept kosher, obviously. And basically ate dairy, because they didn\u2019t have any dishes and\ncutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only\nmeat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. But because of their hospitality\nreputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed\nthrough Holland from Canada, or from England, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher,\nstayed in their house, or ate in their house. But they brought their rations over to the\nBergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many\nyears eating meat. But didn\u2019t have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates. So the cans were\nwarmed up on the stove, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat.\nThat\u2019s the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a\nelegant restaurant with all the trappings of a restaurant, having to serve their own in this\nway. But they made -- they made the transition, we\u2019ll open up another restaurant a\nnumber of years.",
        "Q: They did?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, in Scheveningen, of all places.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and then that -- then they moved to Israel, right.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So, you know, I\u2019m trying to convey that --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- | was absorbing a complete new s -- and I was getting older, I was able to record that\nmentally.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And that became part of my ex -- post-war experiences.",
        "Q: Did you, within a short period of time say, where are our parents, or did you have a se --",
        "A: No, I was told --",
        "Q: Yo-You were told.",
        "A: -- | wa -- I was -- I was told that we lost our parents, they died.",
        "Q: You were told that.",
        "A: Whatever that meant --",
        "Q: Uh huh. Meant, yeah.",
        "A: -- in the long run, that was not a issue.",
        "Q: Okay. And were you told that once you had left Theresienstadt, or do you -- do you have\nany recollection?",
        "A: No, I think already most probably before, because when we got that postcard from the\ntrain, in discussions with my brother and sister, whenever it may have come up, I think I\nhad it already a general sense --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that I have no longer my parents.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But after the war, when you hear other stories of -- people\u2019s life stories of losing a\nhusband, a wife, children, then I realized that -- where I fit it in, that I also lost parents. I\nwas part of the group of people who went through the war, some went through in hiding,\nbe -- people in groups, some were in hiding. Some were in this camp, some were in that\ncamp, some were in convents. And I was in two camps, and some people lost -- or didn\u2019t\nlose, and I lost. So eventually I fit it in to my category, and -- but that was a pretty\ndynamic -- I use the word dynamic selectively, seeing people were really -- had to re-\nestablish themself, that some people could make it. And also it was very much evident\npeople want get out of Europe as -- or Holland as fast as possible, many people, they --\nthe first opportunity to get out, and especially the children. They sh --",
        "Q: Especially children?",
        "A: There -- they -- once they get their [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Children.",
        "A: -- out of the country, out of Europe. Not a good place to be. Partly out of memory, but\npartly out of experience. So it was a sizeable exodus. Felt wa -- was -- weren\u2019t too many\npeople who survived, okay? But there was a noticeable exodus of people who left to\nEngland, people who left to isr -- Palestine. And some people stayed. And some elderly\nparents -- pa -- no -- reluctantly but willingly encouraged their children to leave. And\nsome people couldn\u2019t stop the children that want to get out of there as fast as possible.\nAnd that a -- again, I absorbed that part of the scene.",
        "Q: Right. We need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Charles, did you want to leave?",
        "A: I did leave, as you know.",
        "Q: I know. I know you did, I wanted to --",
        "A: Right, but for different reasons than what was occurring. Th -- when I say people who\nwere eager to leave were the older people [indecipherable] not sure, take these two\nchildren of my relatives, Bergers, Miriam and Manfred, they got out as fast, but they\nwanted to leave right away, I mean they were -- imagine not being with their parents for\nseveral years, and May, June they see them, and they wanted to get out, on -- go to\nPalestine. The parents did not -- were not encouraging that right away, but reluctantly\nthey yielded, so right after the high holidays, they left on the illegal transport, where they\nwere put in Cypress, they ga -- had a long journey. But -- so that age bracket and above,\nthere was a much greater personal decision to leave Europe, or leave Netherlands. They\nboth went to Palestine. One of them there right now. The tragedy was that the brother\nended up in Palestine. When the state was established, he was in the army, and he was\nkilled by a convoy in the protection of Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Was\njust -- had just become engaged to a beautiful Yemenite girl, and so now that\u2019s -- the\nfamily had to absorb that loss after being spared the other hurdles of the war, ended up a\nvictim in Palestine - Israel. Parents not fully revere -- recovered from that wound,\nwhereas the war wounds were healing, that wound kind of was pretty difficult for them to\ndeal with. But other people also were leaving. And in contrast to the pre-war, which I\ndon\u2019t recall too much, Westerbork or Terezin, there I did have friends. I visited homes\nlike in more normal circumstances. But again, 1t was somewhat temporary, because\npeople I dealt with, they moved out to other countries suddenly, okay? And myself also\nleft. But it was a different -- but I do know the names of people who were there. We\njoined the youth organization, I think it was the precursor of Bnei Akiva. My brother was\nolder, he was allowed to join, I tagged along with him, and given that was much choice,\nnot too many other children around, they let me come. And we went to hikes and\nactivities. So we had a little more normal type of event, of youth organizations that\nobviously you didn\u2019t have before, and some of the names of the people from that period I\nstill know by name. And I\u2019ve discovered recently one is in t -- married, you know, with\nfamilies in Toronto, and one lives in Israel, and one here, one no longer lives. But that\nkind of life became more normalized. I went to school in Amsterdam, Jewish school, and\nes -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either synagogue, with people. So it kind of --\nbut even those teachers started leaving. We had the teacher, and the middle of the year\nthey went to England. Of course, it was not a -- people weren\u2019t on the firm ground, or so.\nSo we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural for me to leave, because that\u2019s what other\npeople were doing for all kinds of reasons, which I may not have been fully aware. But it\nwas not my decision, of sorts, because my other relatives, who were closer in relative\nranking that the Bergers, my father\u2019s brother lived the United States, and they were also\nrelated to the Bergers so they were in touch, wanted us to join him. And my mother\u2019s\nsister in Zurich wanted us to join them. So we were wanted, but we were kind of being\npulled in two different directions. And the decision was that the two boys would go to\nNew York, and the girl would go to Zurich. Whether that\u2019s wi -- wise decision or not 1s\nnot for me to say.",
        "Q: Who -- who made that decision, do you think?",
        "A: The relatives.",
        "Q: Ah, I see.",
        "A: I mean, both had a loo -- a genuine eagerness to want to absorb us, and you know, take\ncare of us as children without parents. And they decided, not to divide the spoils, but they\nthought that boys would be better off in education, particularly Jewish education in\nUnited States, and the girl would fit in better in Switzerland. My aunt had a -- uncle had a\ndress store, an elegant dress store, and she could perhaps work her way into that. But\nanyway, we were split, which my sister to this day finds horrendous. And she found it\nvery surprising that it was proposed and implemented.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t it difficult for the three of you to split like that?",
        "A: It was difficult, yes, yes. And especially those were days where na -- ba -- people didn\u2019t\nhave telephone conversations, you know, you wrote to each other, kept in touch that way.",
        "Q: But she of course, remains even more alone. You are split, but you\u2019re still with the one --",
        "A: I have a brother.",
        "Q: You have a brother.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: And he -- she goes into -- did she know these folks?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Not -- no --",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: -- these are strangers.",
        "A: -- well, well, my -- my uncle from Switzerland, that\u2019s the -- my aunt -- my si -- mother\u2019s\nsister\u2019s husband came to visit us in \u201946, okay? Very nice, brought clothing and candy and\ntreated us, and -- very nice, and told us about the family linkages, and all of that, and so it\nwas either total stranger -- we knew the name of the family, the -- these -- okay.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] but this was not someone close that you --",
        "A: We hadn\u2019t dealt with them in years, obviously. And the United States family, all I knew\nwas my father\u2019s brother, my uncle. But I had never seen him. I don\u2019t think my brother\nsaw him either. And they were again, far away, the United States was far, far away. So\nthat was a new change in our life status of being separated, moved away from Holland,\nand a new stage of our life had to begin. But again, the intentions certainly were well-\nintentioned. Whether is was appropriate under the circumstances, but that set the course\nfor our lives, and with the ca -- impl -- consequence. My sister married somebody from\nSwitzerland, we ended up in United States. And were raised over there by my uncle and\naunt, who were very generous to absorb two more children in a household of six children.",
        "Q: They had six?",
        "A: They had six.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And raised us effectively under their auspices, so I\u2019m certainly appreciative --",
        "Q: And this was in New York City?",
        "A: In New York City.",
        "Q: Did he remind you of your father at all? Was there any -- anything that struck you?",
        "A: Mm, I -- wa -- that -- my memory of my father was vague. I -- my -- the only memory of\nmy father is this -- the last scene, sitting on his lap with tefillin on his head. That\u2019s not a\nassociation, that\u2019s a picture, a photograph. No, I don\u2019t -- I was too young to make that\nsort of linkage.",
        "Q: Did you get along with the other six kids?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t mind two more.",
        "A: Not -- no, they were kind. I mean [indecipherable] me, I was another refugee, and the\nimmigrant, and --",
        "Q: Green.",
        "A: -- kid who went through the war. Went through the war. So, of a helpful, and --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- no, and some of the children were closer in my age, so I could relate to them, and some\nwere close to my brother. They fi -- we fitted in after awhile, and at the time we were\narrive already, the older children kind of were started to move out of the house. So, the\nfamily was not as large on a daily basis.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It still was large, I mean, and totally appreciative obviously that I had a home. Because\notherwise, you know, that\u2019s a big problem after the war, people were homeless. Some\npeople had, you know, lost their parents, and their siblings, or what have you, and\nnowhere to go. And their immediate, or s -- distant relatives were also killed during the\nwar, so I was relatively better off.",
        "Q: Right. Did y -- when did you learn English, when you came here?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So you -- what -- did you speak a common language in the household before you learned\nEnglish?",
        "A: Well, they spoke German, I understood German. I don\u2019t know where exactly I learned\nGerman, but I learned German somewhere along the line. Of course, at home we did not\nspeak German, Dutch was -- probably -- the parents spoke Yiddish. But that was a\ncommon language, and then I start --",
        "Q: What did you think of New York? It\u2019s so dir -- I mean, Amsterdam is small, very quaint.\nNew York is huge, massive.",
        "A: Oh, it was very massive, oh yes, it was very massive. And the whole -- well, generally,\nafter the war, a lot of things were brand new for me. I mean, the food was brand new. I\nhad eaten -- I had not eaten oranges till I -- I think got in the -- either in Amsterdam or\ngot in the plane and --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- of -- or so. When I came off the boat, came here on the boat, people offered me a\nbanana, I didn\u2019t know how to open it. I mean, it\u2019s a strange food.",
        "Q: Course.",
        "A: Or so -- so, y -- generally even in Holland after the war, there were all kinds of new ec --\nexperiences or so, about food, or otherwise. I remember with my bo -- my uncle from\nSwitzerland, who took us out and treated us to vanilla ice cream. And the pungency of\nthat vanilla taste is still in my mouth, I mean, I just -- it\u2019s very different today, doesn\u2019t\nhave the same intensity of taste, but it was a very strong taste, a flavor which I never had,\nor don\u2019t recall, I may have had it when I was five or six. But from five to six to nine was\na long time. So those things kind of, you know, were all sensations that we experienced.\nThere was an ho -- another interesting thing was I was saying of -- people were kind of\ncoming out of the woodwork in some sense. The people who were in hiding got out right\naway, from the camps. Those who had a place to go had right away -- some straggled in,\ndepends where they were kept, in which camp. So it was an ongoing process of people\ncoming, and eventually people leaving. Was a lot of young people, particularly children\nhad to be taken out of convents or hiding places, and was a big battle sometimes, you\nknow, older sisters f -- survived. [indecipherable] little sister was in the convent in\nBelgium, went through the effort, identified everything [indecipherable] and that little\ngirl refused to come. Again, in this Berger household we had a lot of traffic, but people --\nthere was a home, people came across. So I in some sense absorbed more of that than I\nwould have otherwise. And I remember those two sisters finally successful in getting out,\nthis whole discussion of getting their little sister out, finally getting their sister out, and\nthe sister rebellious, she wants to go back to the sisters in Belgium, rather than the sisters\nin Holland. And I think eventually she had -- had -- had to yield it, they got -- bring her\nback. You know, the chief rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Herzog went through country to country,\nalso through Holland, trying to save those children, invoking his position in dealing with\nthe clergy, and the church. And had very great difficult time, I remember him there with\nhis top hat, and making, you know, talking about his experiences. That was an event. So,\nit was -- th-the post-war reconstitution was very much an activity of the country, of the\nJewish community. And therefore was a lot of activity and movement, and was not a --\nyou know, a stable community, were never -- never really became stable, because\nHolland as you know, lost a very high proportion of it\u2019s Jewish population.\nUnderestimated the people talk about [indecipherable]. The interesting little side story,\nmy relative, my uncle -- I call him uncle, he was a Berger, had a brother in Palestine, who\nwas a -- ashoe store. And one day he sent a crate of Yaffa oranges to him. And that was a\ncommunion celebration, they handed out these oranges as prizes to people, and\neverybody took those -- an orange for their entire family. And there was the biggest gift\nthey could ever dream of after going through the war, of getting something from\nPalestine, a Yaffa orange. So, I remember we got one too, and it was something, you\nknow, unique. So a lot of feelings were going on in the country, which today people have\nmuch less -- they take a lot of things for granted. Every -- every -- ev -- all these events\nbecame events rather than, you know, part of a routine life. So 1t was, 1n some sense,\nquote, exciting. Because things were really appearing, and I was -- as I was getting older,\nI was a -- absorbing these things much more than anything before [indecipherable]\ncertainly I was a little boy, but already approaching 10 - 11, to move on there. So carry\nback interesting memories of the year in Holland.",
        "Q: W-Was there any schooling during that year, or",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable]",
        "Q: There was?",
        "A: There was schooling, in a Jewish school, and I got -- there got my formal teaching,\narithmetic, and geography, and --",

        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I mean had [indecipherable] fortunately I had no learning disability or\nlearning problem, and most probably I wasn\u2019t the only one who had the shortcoming of\nlack of education, cause pe -- similar people that were my age must have had something\nsimilar, didn\u2019t go to school during the war. So it may have been, you know, equal peer\nclass.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Like, I never thought of it in these terms, but my -- I -- I went to do what s-s-sc --\nstudents have to do. And so anyway, we went to the United States, a long route, because\nThe Joint was involved in transporting people from one country to another, and so it was\na torturous trip to go from Holland to Antwerp, to end up in Marseilles on the buses and\ntrains, or so, and in fact I saved The Joint, I think, a big bundle because one of the stops,\none of the night st -- overnight stops was a U.S. army camp, and we\u2019re supposed to stay\none night then go on to the next stop and go to whatever quarters we were supposed to\ngo. They have a whole group, not only us, I mean a bunch of children. And I became\nviolently sick in that --",
        "Q: First time.",
        "A: First time. The odors of the mess hall were so powerful that I actually couldn\u2019t take it. I\nbecame sick, and vomiting, and fever and all of that. I may have had other problems, too.\nSo the com-commander of the camp was very upset that somebody became sick under his\nreign. So he told people to stay till I become healthy. But they kne -- they knew our\ntravelogue, or itinerary, and he kept us there till we able to go to the boat to Marseilles.\nSo I think The Joint saved a big bundle, for again, strange reasons. And they took a --\ntook a boat to the United States, a long journey.",

And well, that\u2019s what the [indecipherable] kind of,\nthen a new stage of life, which -- come to the United States, and be absorbed in a new\nfamily. And schooling over there, and then things became uphill.",

In fact, I talked to\na survivor, and really there are two stages of survival, one is survive the war, another one\nis survive the post-war.",

So when we came to United States, rather than having in the\nfamily, same household, Sigmann and sig -- Siegman, we took on their name, but\neventually it had to be changed when I became a citizen, formally, because my -- my\npassport, original passport from Holland to United States was S-i-g-m-a-n-n. That\u2019s how\nI was registered.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But the difference in the spelling is not that great, so we took it on.",
        "Q: Why did they change the name to S-i-e? Why not S-1-g-m-a-n, do you have any idea?",
        "A: No, I think it sounds -- zi -- see, in the German pronunciation was Ziegman.",
        "Q: Ziegman, I see.",
        "A: Okay. And zieg is 1 -- is a --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay. So they only changed the double n, but I wasn\u2019t -- again, I was not there when it\nhappened.",
        "Q: Did you call him uncle all the time?",
        "A: Uncle, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: And his wife, aunt?",
        "A: His wife Aunt Susie, yes, yes, yes. We knew that we, know, were not part of the original\nfamily, we were old enough that -- I mean, that -- had it been, you know, five years\nearlier, may have been different story, you know? So we kept our family identity, but we\nwere certainly part of the --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Siegman family, and raised under their guidance and support, and --",
        "Q: And -- and how many years before you saw Lily again?",
        "A: I saw Lily again in 1960.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: A long time.",
        "Q: Long time.",
        "A: She had moved to Israel, 1951, I think, married, had a --",
        "Q: Oh, so she -- she left fairly soon from that family?",
        "A: She left fairly soon, yes, yes. She went down Aliyah.",
        "Q: So she must have been six -- 16 or 17 when she left.",
        "A: Around that time, 16 - 17, right, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Wow. So she must have been unhappy in some way, no? I mean --",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to speak for her.",

        "Q: To Israel.",
        "A: Israel.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then she had met somebody, but she wasn\u2019t married when she left -- who was also\ngoing to Israel. And soon after, they married in Israel, and settled there. But 1960 --\nmeanwhile we were in touch through letter writing.",
        "Q: Yes, I understand.",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: But he -- here you -- you all grow up --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and you\u2019re adults now.",
        "A: Absolutely. No, it was a big change.",
        "Q: Big change, you know.",
        "A: Big change, but interesting, there was a lot of personal chemistry.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Oh yes, we retained, oh yes, because of our letter writing, and somehow it went through\ntogether. When I visited her 1960, was immediately back to where we left off, whatever\nthat word means.",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s fabulous.",
        "A: And this -- and the same thing was true with this daughter Berger. I hadn\u2019t seen her --\nwell, that\u2019s [indecipherable] right. I hadn\u2019t seen her from 1946, when she left after the --\n1945.",
        "Q: Until -- until --",
        "A: Well, then I saw her in happene when I visited Holland on 1960, then to Israel, too, I met\nher again.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But we started off where we left off.",
        "Q: The same thing, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. And now too, when we meet or so --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we have a much more sense of belonging to the same family or so, than -- or --\nalthough we have very different paths, different experiences since then, but we still have\na lot in common.",
        "Q: Did you feel you divided culturally when you were here? Or were you young enough so\nthat you soon became a kind of American kid? Do you have that -- do you have any --",
        "A: Well, now it took getting used to, I mean, but people acclimate when they -- first of all,\nwant to acclimate quickly. I came in with the Berger family, was -- they didn\u2019t want to\nsend us with old, ragged clothes so they went out -- out of the way to buy new wool suit\nfor us, with the knickers, pants or so. That\u2019s how I arrived United States, but 1t was not\nstylish here, and I disposed of them very quickly, okay?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And I started wearing, you know, American type clothing, and so I -- I -- the language\ntook a little longer. I was in some sense fortunate again under the circumstances that I\nwas raised in a neighborhood in the West Side, where there were a lot of immigrants, too.\nUrban families who so -- survived the war, or came pre-war, so it was not coming into\nmiddle America. Was partly European, and West Side in general is very cosmopolitan.",
        "Q: Now where in the West Side were you? Lower West?",
        "A: No, the upper -- upper West Side.",

        "Q: Oh, 88\", okay.",
        "A: West -- on the West End Avenue.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So -- and the synagogue we went to was again, familiar territory, and so it was at -- that\ncultural change was not as dramatic had it been otherwise, what some people went\nthrough. But the language and the clothing you saw this, you want to be, you know, like\neverybody else.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I had to learn quickly. And up to a point, the children in school were kind to me,\nbecause again, there -- that was [indecipherable]. I was a refugee, went through the war,\nwhatever that meant, no parents. That\u2019s -- some were sensitive, some were not, but on the\nwhole, they had experienced that too, because the school that I went to, they had -- I was\nthe first one who was -- they had [indecipherable] seen this before, so it was interesting.\nA kind of interesting story was that when -- it was I learned how to play one of the sports,\nand, you know, and be one of the boys or so, so in the courtyard during recess, the kids\nplayed punchball. You know what a punchball is?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [indecipherable] a pink Spaulding -- Spaulding --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- punching [indecipherable] baseball with base -- with a Spaulding. And everybody had\nto be chosen for the team, that was the rule, so I was chosen as well on one of the teams,\nbut I was useless because I didn\u2019t know what the game was all about, didn\u2019t understand\nthe language or the instructions, what people screaming about. And my luck was that a\nguy, the other team hits the -- punches the ball right to me, and I miss it, and people\nstarted jeering and screaming. And then one young kid, young little fellow with black\neyes, remember his name, got up and scolded the kids. This boy went through the war,\netcetera, lost his parents, etcetera. If you [indecipherable] with him, you\u2019ll never get it --\nnever hear it again, the end of it. And then suddenly I was part of the team, and people\naccepted me. So it was a good lesson, people learned I was so -- I mean, the kind of\n[indecipherable] fact I recite it indicates that I remember it favorably.",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: But it was a need to be, you know, integrated in the small and the big. But again, my\ntransition was a little bit better than it cou -- 1t could have been much worse. Wasn\u2019t -- for\nme it was a gradual transition to the American scene, because the rest of the people\naround me were also heavily from immigrant families.",

        "Q: Charles, what did your uncle do?",
        "A: He was in the diamond business.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Wholesaler. But originally when he came to the United States, he was in textiles in\nEurope, and he had to start a new business, of course, ca -- can\u2019t do textiles over here.",

        "A: He came from -- was born in Przemysl as well, and lived in Frankfurt, and lived in\nAntwerp. And he managed to escape with his family, quite an ordeal, and quite a story, if\nyou want to hear a -- what\u2019s called a flight story, I recommend you speak to his son. A\nremarkable story, how they managed to go through enemy territory, through France, back\nto Belgium, through Casablanca, to the United States, with being separated, and my aunt\nbeing pregnant, and having a -- he had -- my uncle had his -- my grandmother, his mother\nwith him.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And down the line, I mean, quite a story how they ma -- how they made it, how they were\nnot driving cars, and [indecipherable] had to hire a car for at that time, for five children\nand two adults in Europe, a truck or so, and use your wits about it. Is -- if you -- I don\u2019t\nknow if you have any flight documentary -- documentation, but it\u2019s a remarkable story.",
        "Q: So you -- what grade to you start when you start school there, since you seem to --",
        "A: Well, since I had a year in Holland --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I was not as much back, so f -- had -- technically I had -- give me credit for one year\nfor Holland, and the second year over there. So when I came to the United States, they\nput me into fourth grade.",
        "Q: Okay. So you\u2019re actually pretty much where you should be.",
        "A: No, no, I was -- no -- no, no. I came to United States in \u201946, when I was --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: -- okay? I should have been really in the fifth grade.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: So I\u2019m -- I spent, I think a few months in the fourth grade, and I was promoted to the fifth\ngrade. Where I was more sensitive, I wanted to be where I belonged, somehow. That --\nand I fortunately caught up soon enough that I did not have to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, carry that, being behind, whatever that meant, for a long period. But the\nyear in Holland was pretty good for me. I think it was in Holland, it was in Holland, it\nwas in the third grade they put me. So, oddly enough, my arithmetic was better than peop",
        "Q: I\u2019m not surprised.",
        "A: -- than the kids over here --",
        "Q: The kids here, right.",
        "A: -- were, and so I was -- I -- I did all right in schooling, and yet managed to catch up quick\nenough.",
        "Q: Right. And you went to high school on the upper West Side as well?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no, no. I went after one year in upper West Side for a kind of day school, I went to\nYeshiva in the East Side.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: By the sixth grade. And went through high school there as well.",
        "Q: And then where did you go to s -- college?",
        "A: Then I went to City College in the evening.",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right. The other courses went much easier. I thought originally of going into\ninternational relations, or so and was -- had easy street, I got A\u2019s, and you know, just\ncoasting through it, and economics I had to think, had to read. So, I decided --",

        "Q: So where did you meet her?",
        "A: On the street with a group, she was with a group of youngsters, and I knew some people\nin that group. So I had a conversation, which she recalls, too.",
        "Q: That\u2019s funny. And you met in Canada?",
        "A: In New York, she was in New York.",
        "Q: In New York, I see.",
        "A: And the rest is all good history. Much, much more favorable chapter.",
        "Q: She had a good -- she had a better history than you did?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. She was --",
        "Q: Cause she was here, she was here?",
        "A: She lived in Montreal. She was raised in Montreal --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. I see.",
        "A: -- and her parents had been there for -- way before the war, so she did not personally\nexperience, nor did her parents --",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In Poland, who left -- who remained there. So she had a more normal upbringing.",

        "A: -- | have nice grandchildren, and a lot of, you know, happy days and times and -- and of\nrewards for surviving.",
        "Q: Yes. D-Do you, when you look back on the times after the war, do you see a lot of ways\nin which what happened to you affected you, or is that really very difficult to parse out?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- definitely the war experience is engraved into me. I mean, I know, I went\nthrough the war, I know I lost my parents and two brothers. So I\u2019m very sensitized to the\nShoah and what happened, part because I lived through it, in my own way. I was not as\ndirectly affected like some other people went through hell. I did not have, you know, my\n-- any numbers carved into me. And I was not beaten up physically, or so, but I certainly\nam a victim of not -- of having had a lost childhood. I mean that never -- right? I knew I\nwas different, but [indecipherable] and the younger ages when I came United States, I\nknew I was not the same everybody else. Other people had parents, other people had\nnormal memories, I had no pictures of my childhood, I had very few concrete episodes,\nno family vacations, except for I went back, you know, to the beach story, but -- so I -- I\nknow I was different, and I was at a young age is especially more sensitive. Once you get\nmarried and have children, you join another category of life. I was more with a similar\ngroup, but the issue where you come from, whether it was raised, or -- know, specifically,\nor underlying, people talk about experiences which I could never talk about. Or show\npictures, or something of this sort, so that respect it affected me, or so, over time I th --\nI\u2019m sure that my sensitivities about the world events or so, must have some roots in my\nexperience as well. I don\u2019t want to link everything who I am, I do -- I don\u2019t want to sou --\nI never wanted to, I don\u2019t intend to psychoanalyze myself, of you know, my behavior or\ngood deeds, or bad deeds, or good habits or bad habits are attributed to the war, and I\ndon\u2019t feel that I have to glean who I am, or attribute who I am to the war experience. I am\nwho I am with that being part of me, but it\u2019s -- certainly it\u2019s a very central part of my\nmemory of -- or so, though fortunately, since 1945, many other events have happened, I\nmean good events have happened, that they have receded, okay, proportionately of my\nlife, I have the good life.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Okay? But that doesn\u2019t eliminate --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- what I went through, and awareness of it. I\u2019m a different person, of course, of what I\nwent through. How different, in which ways, very difficult to pinpoint. Obviously, I mean\n[indecipherable] I\u2019d never come to the United States, I mean, that\u2019s [indecipherable] you\nknow, and my wife -- if you go through -- if you go this sort of route, so --",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t have met, you wouldn\u2019t have --",
        "A: Would -- exactly, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting over here right now. So I -- by the nature of the\nanimal, life would be different because of the war in so many ways which I cannot eve --\ntrace. Nor would I know what had happened. You can\u2019t predict -- too parallel life events,\nor so. So Iam who I am, with that being a major part of me.",
        "Q: Did your uncle talk to you a lot about your father and your mother, so you could get a -- a\n-- a picture of them?",
        "A: No, he talked very little about his family in general.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And talked very, very little about my father and mother. My aunt from Switzerland talked\nmore, oddly enough.",
        "Q: You mean the one that -- who took in --",
        "A: -- the one -- the one that\u2019s -- my sister, Lily, right.",
        "Q: Lily, I see.",
        "A: Not oddly, I think, just different circumstances. And my uncle was much more tight\nlipped about family in general, or -- not to [indecipherable] re us. In part I also think that\nhe -- that\u2019s more speculation than fact, but I feel that maybe even fact, he I think felt\nsomewhat guilty that he did not do more to get my parents out, whether it would be more\nencouraging or physical action. He himself had come to the United States in \u201941 or so, so\nthere were some years involved. I have no idea -- I have no clue how much contact they\nhad. He told us [indecipherable] was very -- always a very -- my -- my father was the\nolder brother, and he always told about his respect and, you know, esteem for him, only\nto talk to him as a younger brother. But he never talked about details of background. But\nhe never talked about his own -- to his own children either, too much. So when I speak to\nmy cousins, his children are so now about -- because they also regret they never pumped\nhim for information just in the family tree. [indecipherable] or so, and his background or\nso. Anyways, the answer to your question is no, very little information about my parents.\nSo that\u2019s another void.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: How they lived, how they celebrated, how they did things. My brother knows a little bit\nmore, my sister knows bits and pieces, I know very little. That\u2019s certainly a blank\ncompared to other children.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Wa -- so again, that -- it\u2019s understandably I was a very little boy, right, so I don\u2019t recall\nwhere -- and my sister mentions to me that for my father\u2019s 40\" birthday he got a electric\nshaver.",
        "Q: And you wouldn\u2019t know, right.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know, right? That was a big deal in Holland to get an electric shaver, because\npeople used to use shaving paste --",

        "A: -- to do the beards, so.",
        "Q: Let me ask you an odd -- something of an odd question. When you mentioned the\npostcard, and your brother telling you of the postcard, something happened to you.",
        "A: I choked up a little more, right?",
        "Q: Yeah. What is it, 1-is that symbol of the loss for you, do you think, or s --",
        "A: In part it\u2019s a symbol of the loss, obviously, but also is the content. I mean, for parents to\nwrite a farewell note to parent -- to the children is not normal, and for a brother to end up\nsaying [indecipherable] which means I will see you again, and never materialized, is a\npainful message to receive, but never follow through. So more emotions may be evoked\nfrom that than describing that they went on a train, and they open up a -- a suitcase in the\ncamp.",
        "Q: Right, right. Okay. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to mention that I have not asked? I\u2019m\nsure there\u2019s --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To the extent that I have four children and a family and grandchildren, my two brothers\nwould had equal families, and never experienced any personal fulfillment in this regard,\nand my parents never saw grandchildren, I did. So all the human relationships, and all the\nhuman events, were kind of disrupted. I had a disjointed childhood at best. My brother\nhad consequences of it, my sister are similar, you know, so this is just one family to,\nquote, just one family, and there\u2019s plenty of damage, and I repeat again, I did not\n[indecipherable] go through the personal horrors of people who go through Auschwitz, or\nber -- Buchenwald, and tell horrible stories, you know, on a personal basis or so. But\nthat\u2019s just a kind of little composite story of one family and how it spreads, what\nhappened to us, and how one takes it.",

        "A: Okay, thank you.",
        "Q: And we\u2019re going to take a break and look at the photographs.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay Charlie, describe this picture for us.",
        "A: This is a wedding picture of my parents, 1922, in Frankfurt, with the extended family\nthere, and including in the back right behind them, my mother\u2019s sister and her husband,\nRosie Goodman, and Morris Goodman, where my sister went after the war. Next to\nMorris Goodman 1s Pepi Berger, who -- with whom I stayed for one year in Holland, with\nher husband Josef Berger. And next to her is Mendel Siegman, who is my father\u2019s\nbrother, with whose family I stayed, starting in 1946 till 1962, with his wife Suzie\nSiegman, who is not 1n the picture, he wasn\u2019t married yet. This picture went through the\nwar itself, because my cousin carried with him through certain concentration camps, and\nby good circumstances it was finally brought to our attention, so this was salvaged, and\nthis is the kind of big collective origin picture.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: This is a portrait picture of my mother that was taken, I believe, after her marriage, I\ndon\u2019t know exact dates on this one. And it was this plus the next one from my father, was\ngiven to us by very, very close friends of my mother, who had it in their collection, and\nwhen we came back after the war to United States, they wanted to make sure that we\nhave pictures of our parents, and they enlarged it, and framed it, I believe, and -- and\nhave been with us since. They hang on a wall in our din -- living room.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This is the companion picture of my father, also given by the same friends, Hansha Label\nVelk, who were close friends of my mother, and this the only full faced picture I have of\nmy father as an adult after his marriage.",
        "Q: Okay, the picture on the left?",
        "A: On the left is a picture of my mother as a young girl, 1913, must have been 14 years old\nor so, and the [indecipherable] where she was raised in Switzerland. Both this and these\nother pictures are -- giv -- were given to me by my Aunt Rosie from Switzerland, my\nmother\u2019s sister, who had it in her collection. Without her I would not have any pictures of\nmy mother in any stage of her life.",
        "Q: And the one on the right.",
        "A: The one on the right is 1922, most probably either be -- just before or after she was\nmarried. Again, for -- formal posed picture.",
        "Q: Now who\u2019s this?",
        "A: This is my picture of my brother, must be a half a year old or so, 1926. And that\u2019s the\nonly picture I have of my brother. My other brother -- this one, ar -- Aron Erik. My other\nbrother Josef Trey, I don\u2019t have any pictures at all. I am -- most probably didn\u2019t have it in\nher collection, or they never found the occasion to give it to me. But that\u2019s the only\nremembrance picture I have of my p -- late brother.",
        "Q: And this shot?",
        "A: This shot at -- 1s a picture of my father with a friend on the beach in Scheveningen. My\nfather is on the right, the taller man, in 1924, just after he was married. And the\nbackground picture of that big circular building is the prominent hotel in Scheveningen to\nthis day, called The Curacao. Until World War two, that\u2019s all existed on the beach as far\nas the visible building, now it is all built up around it, so it doesn\u2019t look as identifiable\nany more. But it\u2019s only snapshot picture I have of my father.",
        "Q: And who 1s that?",
        "A: This is my mo -- late mother, 1940 picture, the latest picture [indecipherable] really close\nto before she was killed in Auschwitz a few years later. And again, that was given to me\nby my relative. We have -- we carry no pictures with us -- we didn\u2019t carry any pictures\nwith us during the war, obviously, and any family pictures we had we -- either they were\ndisposed or not given to us after the war.",
        "Q: And these pictures?",
        "A: These pictures are from 1946, must be early 46, wintertime in Amsterdam, my uncle\nMoritz from Switzerland came to visit us, brought us lots of clothing, which we are\nwearing, and other goodies, and parading through the center plaza of Amsterdam. To the\nleft I am, next is my uncle, and my sister Lily, and my brother Leo. Wasn\u2019t that a nice\nvisit. On the right?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Is a picture taken after my sister left, otherwise she would have been in the picture, went -\n- left to Switzerland. In the background, in the center, are my relatives, Pepi and Josef\nBerger with whom I st -- we s -- we stayed for one year in Amsterdam. To the left, the\nwoman with the beret is Malka Weinmann, who kept close to us, both in Amsterdam, and\nwhen she came to United States, stayed with -- friendly with us, on good -- very good\nterms. She is, I think, holding a -- a hand of the little nephew. And the woman on the\nright is a sister of Pepi Berger, who was a Regina Felsen, or Feldrin, who married during\nthe war, and -- to a Dutch person, and she was part of the family as well. So this is a kind\nof contemporary Amsterdam picture. Contemporary 1946.",
        "Q: And who is this good looking group?",
        "A: This is the wedding picture of our daughter Dafna with her husband Dani. And next to\nDafna is my wife Gita. And Dafna is holding one of her nephews, Ayal, who is the\nyoungest of our oldest daughter, who is sta -- sitting right be -- standing right behind\nDafna and Dani, that\u2019s Atara, right, and her husband Joel - Jody, right next to her, right.\nAnd their other three children are the boy with the sleeve -- shirts -- shirtsleeve is Ilan,\nshirtsleeve right behind me, right. And on the side, the girl with the white skirt, this is our\noldest granddaughter -- the white skirt at the end, next -- behind my wife Gita.",
        "Q: Oh, here.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s Michal. And in front are our two other grandchildren, one of them is Hadar,\nthe small one, and that -- that\u2019s the four children of Atara and Jody. And next to her is\nShlomit, and the little boy next to me is Yosef, who are the two children, at that time, of\nour daughter Naomi, in back and her husband Ari.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. This is Naomi, this is Ari. And on back, the last two next to Atara are our son,\nright there, tall fellow is next to a -- next to -- that --",
        "Q: Here.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s right. Our son Dov, and his wife Tzviya, right over there. That\u2019s the last family\npicture we had, but there -- since then, we have had, thank God, a few additions in the\nfamily. Atara -- Dafna and Dani had -- to have two children, Amihi and Tahiwa. And\nNaomi had another son, Menachim Benjamin. So thank God the -- is a contrast that they\nhave two wedding pictures, and this 1s the continuity which Hitler tried to destroy, but we\nbeat him.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Left is my wife Gita and myself, and on the other s -- on the right is my wife Gita and\nmyself again, different poses and formality. And this is the best part happened to my life\nwhen I met Gita, and she 1s all around superb blessing for all of us. And those are the\nbright chapters, opened with when I met her, and then the family pictures since. So this is\nthe continuity with a major interruption, and some family tragedy between, but thank\nGod that the bright side is that the continuity exists.\nEnd of Tape #7\nConclusion of Interview\n"

I have\nthe wedding picture of that wedding with me, which is a nice memento. That also has a\nShoah story about it in fact.

        "A: It was a household that was living, I would call middle class life, going to do certain\nactivities, like with fam -- family oriented activities, and Scheveningen was a resort town,\nso there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it\u2019s still a resort town, the beach, and -- so it\nwas an active household. I don\u2019t know much about the social life of my family, so I can\u2019t\nrelate to that. But so I know from the child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal\nincidents which are interesting in their own right, but the fact that I recall them, but also\nthe interesting feature is that both of these little child events -- childhood events where I\nwas actually was saved, kind of -- that\u2019s all I recall. The first one was I was lost in the\nbeach. So the family went to the beach, that\u2019s [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity,\nit was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that\u2019s not unusual. And the police picked me\nup, and I do recall that I was sitting on the policeman\u2019s lap, with a policeman\u2019s cap on my\nhead, waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough, till they found -- till I was\nfound, I think my brother came to pick me up, and then reunited with the family, so I was\nsaved. That was what -- what -- what do we do. Second episode which I recall, was I took\na walk with my sister [indecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a\nshortcut through a park, and was hit by a wooden swing, that time the swings were wood,\nand I was apparently unconscious. I had a sort of a scar right over here. They tell me that\nhad it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I would have been brain dead, centimeter\nbelow, I\u2019d have been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact. I had stitches. Those days\nyou had stitches with like staples, I remember that. And I remember the gift coming\nhome to soothe my return, was a wind-up crocodile, which I wound up and I played on\nthe dining room table, back and forth. So these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but\nthey kind of illustrate I\u2019d led a child\u2019s normal, quotation mark, child\u2019s life in a home\nenvironment.",

The hou -- I mean, the household, as far\nas I recall, I have heard was kind of gran -- rather normal. We had a lot of visitors, I do\nrecall people coming by, and we confirmed -- subsequently I met certain people, relatives\n[indecipherable] I visited when I was a little child with my parents, and down the line.\nAnd that was a kind of -- it was a f -- a close link to families.",

First of all, Holland has two or three communities, the more -- can\u2019t say\nnative, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutch are oriented, people had a number of\ngenerations. They had their own synagogues, and own community. Then there were the\neast European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted and integrated. But\nin Europe in general, there was much more traditional conduct by people affiliated with\nsynagogues, and went. My parents were fully observant, a kosher home, and active in\nZionist organizations. My brother -- my older brothers, Josef and Aron belonged to what\nlater became Brei Akiva, but precursor of those that were active in that, and I do kind of\nhave memories on Shabbat afternoons, they were leaving to their groups. All I really\nremember of my two older brothers in a mental, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall\nboys with berets -- common people used to wear berets, and weeker pants, which were\nrolled up at the bottom a little bit, leaving, coming and going. But they were kind of\nactive in youth organizations. So it wasn\u2019t, again, in the broader sense, that description\nwere a normal family, as people would have liked to live, and were not allowed to live.",

But the\nschool period was a very tense period. People -- there was all kinds of talk going on\nalready around the house and in the school, murmurings. What it meant, I had no idea.

People\ncame, and people left. And I si -- this I -- this I did sense, that was an indifferent -- not --\nnot that I had been in school for many years, so as what I did go to a pre-school, I don\u2019t\nrecall. But it was not a stable environment, and this I had sensed right away, both at\nhome, where there were murmurings, and most [indecipherable] parents whisper amongst\nthemselves something, you know, something that\u2019s serious. What exactly it was, I don\u2019t\nrecall. Was as bes -- I -- and was probably children brought into discussions. And of\ncourse I was too young, because I was a child.",

In retrospect it appears\nthat my family, my parents were almost, I think, you know, how to deal with the family\nsituation of how to -- not escape, but wh -- w -- to find means t -- how to survive. So if\nthey have to -- if I hid -- if they would place me in hiding, or what have you, then you\ndon\u2019t start school, necessarily.

By 1942 my oldest brother\nwas -- \u201924 to \u00b042 -- ah -- was 18 years old, and [indecipherable] was 16.",

We were not\nlast, but we were not first, either.",
        "A: So the family planned to [indecipherable] our situation, and what wa -- was happening --\nwhat happened was that my mother and two older brothers, Erik and Josef -- Aron and\nJosef, they went to one location, my sister to another, and my brother and myself to\nanother. And bro -- those locations were strange in retrospect, but made sense at the time.\nThere was a notion that certain people are less likely to be rounded up, or perhaps even\nimmune, exempt. So if you stay, even with Jewish families that have that character about\nthem, you are protected. So the notion was that my mother and her brothers, who were of\nworking age, they were put into a -- a mental asylum, because the thought was that they\ndon\u2019t need -- they\u2019re not going to be prom -- people at -- either accepted or believed the\ncase that there were the people being shipped for work. So, they\u2019re not going to take\npeople who have mental problems, they\u2019I] leave them alone, spend your energies\nelsewhere. My sister was placed in another type of home, and initially with, I believe in\nher case, a pregnant woman, who again they thought wouldn\u2019t be taken, or a woman who\nhad just given birth. That was sort of conventional wisdom at that time, and so we were\nseparated from our parent, and the parent itself -- my father stayed at home.",
        "A: My -- my fa -- my -- my mother and my two older brothers in another place, and my\nsister in one place, and my brother and I in another place.",
        "A: With my brother.",
        "A: To -- to this family, I think to -- to a woman had just given birth.",
        "A: Yes, Ill see you later, you know, we\u2019ll come back. Now, what is interesting 1s that\npeople had -- ma -- see I -- the reason my father stayed at home apparently, was to kind\nof settle affairs, his belongings, and who knows what, and come -- and contact with\nfamily outside of Holland, I believe, which eventually materialized somewhat for that,\nand to make arrangements for everybody. So, not clear whether our arrangements were\ntemporary or permanent. My parents were the ones who were making those decisions,\nand I was obviously not privy to those at all. So they have a sense of being in diff -- sure,\nthings were different, but whether it\u2019s permanent or temporary, I had no sense of that at\nall. And my brother was there, so maybe that acted as a sense of stability for me. And the\ndays went. There also was a conventional wisdom, which was [indecipherable] based on\nfact, that round-ups took place late afternoon, evening. So in the morning, my father, he\nwent to synagogue, and we went to synagogue too, we met my father every morning at\nsynagogue. So that respect, things were normal. So we met, and he patted me, chatted\nme, kissed me or s -- what, and it was a daily event. And my last image of my father is\nsitting on his lap, he with his tefillin on, and next day I came he wasn\u2019t there. So then we\nknew that he was deported.",
        "A: We knew something.",

        "A: -- not di -- no, not -- not two, three months, not -- very short period. That family sofe\neither couldn\u2019t keep us, or what have you, and we were put all three of us in an\norphanage.",
        "A: Because again, the view was that the orphanage is a safe haven. They aren\u2019t going to take\nlittle children, little orphans. And meanwhile my mother and two brothers were rounded\nup, my father was rounded up and they move -- they were shipped to Westerbork in the\nend of January.",
        "A: \"43.",
        "A: And middle of January they were deported to Auschwitz and killed there three days later.\nWe were rounded up a little later, in February, I guess.",

        "A: Three, right.",

        "A: Well, through the red -- subsequently, in recent years, I\u2019ve tried to trace down through the\nRed Cross, that -- curious to find out what --",
        "A: -- formally happened, any documentation. Took a long time, oddly enough. It\u2019s very\nstrange that the record keeping was so uneven. After the war -- I mean, now moving --",
        "A: -- on to a different subject matter, after the war, people tried to find out what happened to\ntheir relatives. And in our case, we were more or less told by relatives and others, that our\nparents were deported and sent to Auschwitz and that was the als -- we had no\ndocumentation for that. As a child I did not pursue it very much, but later on as an adult, I\ntried to pursue it, especially when I read about that the Red Cross had tracing of a sort.\nAnd the first few answers was -- is all we know is that they were deported to Auschwitz,\nwe don\u2019t know when, where. Later on they gave us a date, but no formal document\nconfirmation. In year 2001\", I got a Red Cross notification with documentation. Now, it\nturns out that in the Dutch registry, in the -- the government has a regis -- gazettes of a\nsort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed names of the fate of various people, and they send\nus a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who we addressed -- now, had we known that\nit was in the registry, I would have gone to the Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that\nit is available. So the first time I actually had confirmation of my parents death and\ndeparture dates, which initially came really out, that was in year 2000. A long time. And\nin fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- commemoration, not celebration, commemoration of\ndeceased, was an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to commemorate. So --\nyou may be aware that the rabbinate in Israel selected one date of the year for those\npeople that did not know when their immediate families were killed, or died. And they\nselected the 10 of Tevet, but -- so we observe that day as our Yahrzeit day. So the f --\ntook us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actual date, which turned out to be the 15\" of\nShavuot, so --",
        "A: Did they have -- I -- yeah, I\u2019m sure they had, but -- there\u2019s just what happened after the\nwar, a lot of people made confusion, a lot of people made efforts, di -- they hit a\nroadblock, and they kind of called it quits, or so, and nobody came notifying us. I mean,\nthis is a problem, it\u2019s a two sided way, be -- those who knew, didn\u2019t know us, and we\ndidn\u2019t know who knew, okay? So you ask me how do I know the dates, now it\u2019s in black\nand white and confirmed, and it\u2019s from lists -- a big list in the Dutch registry. I have a\ncopy of the registry here with me.",
        "A: I believe it was probably through my father.",
        "A: Cause he -- th-they were picked up and -- in beginning of January, I believe, the first\nweek or so, and then they were -- must have been a week or so in Westerbork, and so we\nwere -- was probably more through my father. The -- these -- there were a lot of ad hoc\narrangements during that period. Some were planned, and some were, you know, you had\nto improvise, and as -- when one option kind of reached it\u2019s end of contini -- continue,\nlike me being in these private homes, where people thought was safe, they found a next\ntier. So we lasted another month in these different places, compared to my parents and\nmy brothers. And then you ask me, you know, did I know what was happening to me, the\nanswer is no. I was, know, placed. I was with people. I was most probably being fed, and\ntaken care of, and that took care of me. I did know that 1 -- used to go to the synagogue in\nthe morning, routine, that stopped. And my brother knew more, he knew that -- what it\nmeant. That once he didn\u2019t see us, that he\u2019d been dep -- rounded up and being deported.\nSo it must have --",

It\u2019s like, you know, little children with babysitters, when the mother\u2019s --\nparents go on vacation, may cry beginning, and subsequently settle down, and -- not that\nit was so nor -- I\u2019m -- not that it was all shipped away. I don\u2019t recall being shipped away.\nBut that was circumstances.",
        "A: So I did not attribute it to, you know, imminent danger, or -- except my parents no longer\nwere visible with me, I\u2019d -- I -- my mother had less contact, because while I was coming\nto the synagogue in the morning, was my father.",
        "A: Not my mother.",

So definitely I must have sensed things were different, but\nwhether that is permanent, or whether that is dangerous, or [indecipherable] I don\u2019t think\na child could catch it immediately, because nothing terrible was happening to me. I\nwasn\u2019t being beaten up, or on the street, or something of this sort. So I mean, I was under\nsomebody\u2019s supervision and auspices, and that\u2019s how I -- I took it, I suppose.",

        "A: I believe it --",
        "A: -- I believe it -- I believe it was a Jewish orphanage. I believe so.",
        "A: But again, based on this assumption, that certain categories of people are going to be\nbypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups notion obviously came very known in the\nJewish community. People\u2019s friends and relatives were being picked up, and people swen\n-- started going into hiding, or escaping, or what have you. Some tried to make\nprovisions. Then they tried to find ways which regarded what are -- where could we or\nour children be safe? And the idea of splitting up families was not a illogical step, that if\nsome people can\u2019t make it, other could make it. And very often, you can\u2019t have a place\nfor seven people, you can have a place for two or three. So you had to split up on\npractical grounds. So, did it hit me that something was affecting me, you know, lifetime\norsat, I doubt it, it was kind of incremental, another step or so. But di -- bottom line was,\nyou know, I was separated from my parents at that age, and that was it. And then\nseparated from my brothers and mother, and that was it. And I was with my little -- older\nbrother, few years older, and a little older sister, and that we were together. And then I\nfollowed what was -- not instructed, where I was told to go, where to go, and move, and I\nmoved along with the -- the flow.",
        "A: Apparently.",
        "A: Okay. But in February when we were rounded up, I do recall the round-up part in\nparticular. We put on the train, and it was a round-up place in Amsterdam, the\nSchouwburg, I think it\u2019s called. Schombu -- Schomb -- Schouwburg, it used to be a\ntheater.

I do recall people scurrying in front of the window, and\nmut -- this relative of mine who I knew, waving to me. I could see it now, I mean -- and\nthen we were put on the train to Westerbork.

Turns out that had we arrived under normal circumstances, we -- they had a\nprocedure in Westerbork when people arrived, the next Tuesday, or the following one,\npeople were picked -- designated to go to the next stop.

        "A: On Tuesday, right.",
        "A: When we arrived in Westerbork, we would have designated to go the next shipment, but -\n- like everybody else, it wasn\u2019t exceptional. It turned out our good fortune was there was\na scarlet fever epidemic in Westerbork, a certain barracks, so they put the camp in\nquarantine, they wanted to protect the German soldiers, they don\u2019t want to get sick. So\nthis int -- this -- they halted the shipments for a week or so. That week was critical for us,\nbecause while we were there, during that quarantine, a very good friend of our family\u2019s in\nAmsterdam, Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by telegram most probably, Westerbork\nauthorities, the Jewish people, or the council people who worked there, that documents\nfrom our family in Switzerland, with Honduran passports, and also, I think, Palestine\nvisas were made available for us and our parents and brothers. Unfortunately for them it\ncame too late. But that week of window saved us, because then we put in different\ncategory of person, because we had Central American passports, and they treated that a\nlittle separate, and the Palestine visa part, they also had some benefit for awhile, because\nthey wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you, and it\nput us into a different classification of detainee, and then we were in this new category,\nand we were put into different grouping. But without that week of scarlet fever, I\nwouldn\u2019t be talking to you.",

        "A: No, but we -- I was told about the papers, something.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. The other thing which I was told, I -- again, is our parents, from the train\nsend a postcard. That was very standard to drop postcards, and if they were lucky, other\ncitizens would pick it up and put it into the mail. And was given to my brother, he -- my\nbrother became the oldest person of the family, and I was told my brother had had a\npostcard from my parents, from what -- what it meant, I didn\u2019t know, but it was now\nwishing us well, take care, and in fact gave us the name of a relative in Switzerland if you\nneed help. And at the end of the postcard our brothers wrote in Hebrew [indecipherable]\nsee you. So I -- this I recall, my brother telling me walking somewhere in Westerbork,\nand telling pos -- not that -- I don\u2019t know, he tells more later, but the -- that we got a\npostcard from our parents on the train, wherever it is. Whatever that meant for me, I don\u2019t\nknow how to re-interpret it, but that little bit of information was given to us, but then we\nput into a new category of people -- not that we knew that we were different there\n[indecipherable] cause we didn\u2019t have the sense of this timetable which we know now.\nPeople didn\u2019t know, necessarily --",
        "A: -- that -- came very rapidly. Now, moving people arrived, stayed, were registered, and\nthen they were shipped out to death camps.",
        "A: Small barracks, little wooden barracks, I recall, and we were put under the guidance of a\nS-s -- orphanage equivalent, a per -- one family was designated to take care of children\nwho were separated from their parents, or lost their parents, or what have you. And we\nput in that group, a man named Birnbaum, Mr. Birnbaum, originally from Germany\napparently, and that was his task. He had a number of children as well, so I became\nfriendly with his child, or he\u2019d like me to play with his child, so I hung around his house\nmore than the standard barracks most of the day. And I kind of took care of us,\ncollectively. But that status helped us, because we not put on lists. There is one episode\nmy brother related to me, which I obviously was not aware of. They didn\u2019t always trust\nthose documents, [indecipherable] they were -- were suspicious, and the fact came from\nSwitzerland helped a little bit, but they called my brother in, and was asking him what do\nyou know about Honduras? Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what. So he\nwas called in, and he was primed by someone, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should\nsay. And he was told that his mother\u2019s in Switzerland, to kind of confirm it, the source\ncame -- that came from his mother, rather than relatives. She was Swiss born, somehow.\nWas -- lived in Switzerland many years, and apparently -- he told me recently again, that\nhe was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how\u2019d you get these\nthings? My mother\u2019s in Switzerland. And they accepted, asked what -- where\u2019s your\nfather, and he didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t given any prompting for that, so he somehow answered,\nhe\u2019s dead, and they let him go. But again, I mean, those are kind of intermediate steps\nwhere our status was even being questioned, and had they determined that it was a fake, it\nwasn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t really, you know, Honduran citizens, or whatever, the passports\nwere not -- we then would have been shipped, that interval. So we spent the year in\nWesterbork among children.",
        "A: Lived in a barrack with children, yes.",
        "A: Very little. Was as -- Iremember a little more the food about Terezin --",
        "A: -- than the food in Westerbork, but there was food. I was, I think, not preoccupied with\nno -- being, again with -- in a group of children, that -- wa -- which probably helped me\nin various stages, that eventually yeah, you played, and you spend your time, and wha --\nwa-was fed, and that was it. My brother was a little more advanced, so he most probably\nhad to kind of keep his ears out what\u2019s happening, and he was therefore more perceptive.\nBut I was not drawn into that orbit at that stage of the game.",
        "A: Coming and go -- yes, yes, yes, yes, I noticed that there.",
        "A: No, because I was there, you see, and as long as I stayed next morning there -- I didn\u2019t --\nI mean, it\u2019s -- again, under the circumstances, my age, had no reason for me to think\nabout the instability of the situation. I mean, as an adult, you think my gosh, you know,\nlook what happened, were you scared, were you -- there\u2019s no -- no reason. I mean, the\nsaving feature was that I hung around with children, cause I was a child, and I was placed\nwith -- in a children\u2019s home, effectively. He was the guardian of a number of children,\nlots of them.",
        "A: Birnbaum. And I was even better off, I was put in close contact with his own children. So\nI was playing and maybe eating at his table, who knows what? There were family units 1n\nthese camp situations, so that kept a little sense of normalcy. Not having my parents\nsomehow did not hit me during that period.",
        "A: They have both there and in Terezin, they had little groups of study groups to keep\npeople entertained and educated a little bit, and teaching, you know, Jewish subject\nmatter, holidays, songs, and both -- some songs, in fact I do recall the music to this day.\nAnd --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There was a round music in fact, Sim Shalom, with the prayer. It was a round. [sings a\nfew lines]. And we sang that, okay? And another one, Shomer Yisrael. Now, they\u2019re\ninteresting in retrospect, those two songs, which also in Terezin, the -- exactly the same\nsongs were taught, I recall, is quite remarkable, because both of them are the prayers of\nhope. We didn\u2019t know the translation as much, but the teachers kind of were injecting\nhope on this place, peace on Israel. Another one is God is the watcher of the remnant of\nIsrael. So, those two songs I remember to this day, but I didn\u2019t have -- it turns out that --\nthat people used to sing them subsequently too, so I don\u2019t know what I would --",
        "A: [sings a few lines of Shomer Yisrael] It was a choir rounding song, or so. And -- so we\nhad instructions, we had learning in both Terezin and ams -- and Westerbork. Westerbork\nI remember more concreteness that I know the loft where we went up, the third floor of\nthe caserne, third tier, not [indecipherable] floor, had three layers. We went up, and we\ndid our little studying, whatever it had to study, you know, instruction, the stories,\nholidays, about Israel, Palestine. And there was a watchman in front of the door\nwatching, because we\u2019re not allowed to have formal classes, and the watchman in\n[indecipherable] I remember the watchman, and whenever the SS guards, or their\nequivalent came by to inspect the place, we got the warning, and we started playing\ncards, or games, or what have you. Very, very similar to the story about Chanukah, where\npeople -- one reason why people played dreidl, because they -- because at that time also,\npeople were prohibited to study the Torah, and with guards coming by, and then people\nimprovised games.",
        "A: And so we went through that in 1943 and \u201944. But there was instruction, but not formal.",
        "A: I had some instruction, well I had very little formal education --",
        "A: -- with three months or so, at best, in Holland, I -- yes, I learned how to read, maybe even\nbefore at home, I don\u2019t recall where. But I remember I read Dutch.",
        "A: And my vocabulary obviously was limited. Was -- didn\u2019t develop, I didn\u2019t have more -- I\nspoke Dutch among the Dutch people in Westerbork, obviously Dutch. And in Terezin\nalso. But I didn\u2019t read books in the normal sense of the term. But there was instruction.\nPeople spent again, their time. They devot -- there were former teachers who were idle,\nso they had some to do, and people took on responsibility to keep the kids occupied, and\nstudy with them. So that was familiar things, but not when it came back after the war I\nhad handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have the same background as other children.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the weather was raw. Dutch weather is not, you know, the most comfortable\nweather except in the spr -- summertime or so. It\u2019s a variation of British weather, wet,\ncold. I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, but not as a personal suffering part, that it\nwas ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, in retrospect I just don\u2019t recall how we\nsurvived both the deprivation and weather conditions, both in Westerbork, and Terezin,\nwhich is even colder, because we didn\u2019t come with, you know, baggage of clothing. Must\nhave had some bags, and as we moved up in age, we grew. Now, I may have taken my\nbrother\u2019s clothing, but [indecipherable] my brother get? Now, we didn\u2019t grow that much.\nWe were stunted in our growth, most probably, but we still grew. So the question mark\nstill is, where did we get our clothing? We may have gotten it from other people who left,\nand the children\u2019s home may well have supplied us. But we didn\u2019t certainly have our own\nwardrobe to take care of us, particularly in cold weather. So every so often I do reflect,\nhow did we manage in cold weather in general, with limited clothing, and not having our\nown clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provide. But I -- I sp -- I assume that these\npeople like Mr. Birnbaum, and subsequently in Theresienstadt the woman who took care\nof us, kind of assembled material, and that there -- that was part of their job, to make sure\nthe children under their charge have clothing. And where they got it from was probably\nfrom people who had to -- we-were transported and left, and then it redistributed. So I\ndon\u2019t know how bitter the cold was for me personally. But it -- I do know it was drab.",
        "A: Well, here again see, I in some sense was a beneficiary of being a young child. I had no\nreason to parade in the large areas like most norm [indecipherable] and I was in this\nBirnbaum family, in their -- and was probably nu -- wherever I slept in the barracks, in\nthe morning go to the Birnbaum\u2019s. So that was my routine, so no reason for me to\nwonder.",
        "A: So the restrictions that existed most probably did not impair me, because there was no\nneed for me to wander around. So that respect, being young was a blessing.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. But that did not necessarily, you know, impact me dramatically because\nthat we had -- that [indecipherable] was on my sweater, and I wa -- it was cold you wore\na sweater, you wore that with the yode star on it. So again, in looking back on it, being a\nsm-small child, or a very young aged little boy protected me, gave me my own little area\nof protection, that I did not face a lot of the other things which I would have faced four\nyears later.",
        "A: My brother had more exposure, both in Westerbork and in Terezin, because as you move\nup the ladder of age, you get -- you\u2019re drawn into these other restrictions. So I can\u2019t say\nthat I felt, you know, restricted or inhibited, like most children in today\u2019s environment\nmost probably wouldn\u2019t feel restricted if they cannot cross the street. You know, if you\nask them 20 years later, did you feel dil -- were you a prisoner of your neighborhood? I\ndon\u2019t think they would express it in these terms.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Not much ta -- of detail, kind of that could mention -- that I have mentioned. I\n[indecipherable] come back subsequently.",
        "A: No, I think that\u2019s -- the time passed, and then we were --",
        "A: A year, we --",
        "A: -- yes.",
        "A: February to February.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: \u201c44",
        "A: Not to me, Leo.",
        "A: Not to me, again. I was -- I don\u2019t feel bad being left out. No, but we were told that ending\nup in west -- in Terezin -- see, in Theresienstadt-stadt, as you know, was a place where\nthey -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second holding place, holding pattern. Primarily people\nwho had certain privileges stay -- privileged status, and our status kind of held, and\ntherefore Westerbork was a place to -- transits, spot to get people out, and so we were\nthere in some sense too long, we didn\u2019t belong in Westerbork because we\u2019re not transit\npeople, and we were not transit to get transported, so they moved them to a new place,\nwhich -- Theresienstadt, which was designed for our kinds of people, all kinds of\nprivileged people. I had no idea that I was privileged obviously, but that settled in later.\nBut -- so I had no sense that that\u2019s a new regime, you know, for me. But my brother and\nsister were there, of course, must -- that must have been very reassuring, to have my\nbrother and sister with me on an ongoing basis. That was my anchor of family stability,\nand the rest was activities throughout the day, or evening. So when I was -- when we\nwere going to Terezin, we were put under the auspices of a social worker from\nAmsterdam, also was being shipped there with her husband, her name was Malka\nWeinmann, and her husband Paul Weinmann, who -- they placed some children under\ntheir responsibility. And we ended up in the train, which again I do remember the\nphysical feature of the train, 1t was a compar -- a European compartment train, was\nprobably third class, but it was not the cattle train, which people unfortunately were\nsubjected to as well. Was a commercial type of train with compartment, and we sat there,\nmy brother, my sister, myself, the two Weinmanns, two elderly people, Rosens, elderly\npeople, and another girl Alicia Farber, who was separated from her parents, so she was all\nalone as well. And we had this train trip to another place. And in the train, I was -- was\nprobably playing on the floor, with whatever we had over there, and Miss Malka\nPollaczek had a suitcase which I opened up, as a curious child would ordinarily do, and I\nplayed with whatever she had over there, I inspected it. And it was a big t-tin can there,\nand I asked her what is this all about, what is this for? And so she tells me, we\u2019 ll use that\nat happy occasion. Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my\nbrother\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, close to -- to the following year. But that -- that scene of the train\nride I remember like a photograph, sitting there, and we moved onto -- from Westerbork\nto Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Several days, I believe.",
        "A: They brought some food, yes. They brought some food and provisions. And I assume -- I\nassume now that we also had our little bags -- people allowed to bring along one suitcase,\nor some bag or so. So whatever we had -- what it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor\ndoes my brother really remember. I asked him. But people had their belongings. And\nwhen we came to Theresienstadt, we were placed with the Dutch population. They was s-\nsegmented, they compartmentalized the people. Sometimes different groups met all\nacross th-the borders, in some sense, but we were among the Dutch. That again, in\nretrospect most probably helped because again, Dutch language was the language we sp -\n- | heard, and people spoke. Not that we knew people -- I don\u2019t think we knew many\npeople over there, but some -- turned out we had some relatives of my mother as well,\nwhom we dealt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our\nguardian, Malka Pollaczek. And she, in fact, was put in charge of the children\u2019s home in\nTerezin as well, which came to my advantage later. The Dutch compound, we were put in\nthe caserne, that -- not -- not barracks, barracks were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty\nimpressive stone buildings with courtyards, and surrounding were -- originally were\nmade for quarters for soldiers. And they used it for the people who were put into\nTheresienstadt, in detention purposes, and they multiplied the number of people in the --\nthose casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded. Had three\ntiers, beds -- three bunk beds. And men were separated from the women. And I now went\nwith my brother, and my sister was -- what -- was accessible, I went to visit my sister.",
        "A: Also in the same Hamborg caserne, that\u2019s where the Dutch were. And they were\n[indecipherable] pretty impressive stone structures. And in that respect you look at it\nnow, it looks like, you know with the courtyard, with kind of tiered, round hallways. But\nall of that was very crowded, and not very, you know attractive. But people always say\nthat Terezin is an attractive place compared with the other concentration camps, and\nthey\u2019re absolutely correct in that respect, but it\u2019s not a place recommend for a vacation.",
        "A: Or for a pleasant journey. It was -- had it\u2019s own drabness all the time, of the stench and\nthe physical environment. So again, I do see a visi -- a vision of a -- of the scene of brown\nwooden bunk beds, three tiers, and lots of people, and crowded, and noisy. But it was not\na calm environment. Bedbugs, lice on the beds, killing at night was an activity, you know\nto s-swipe them, do away with them. And then had get -- got a new routine in Terezin.\nNow, Terezin I remember a little bit more, because I was older, so I have more mental\nimages of Terezin. In ret -- in comparison to everything else, it was spacious. Was --\nokay? Because you had these big courtyards, and then from caserne to caserne there was\nanother walkway, and when you moved down from there -- there I did walk outside of\nthe caserne for a reason I\u2019Il tell you in a minute. So you had a sense of not being totally\nconfined to one building, or one narrow area. And that kind of tri -- helped the physical\nbenefit from being that -- not [indecipherable] confined. But it wa -- once you\u2019re in the\nbarracks, it was very crowded. But I was basically confined to that quarters for line-up,\nfor soup, for the meals, and for daily activity. And the learning study group I mentioned\nbefore, the study group was up in that loft, up to the left, if I recall correctly, where we --\nI went on a basis. So I didn\u2019t, again, wander around much till later in Terezin. And a lot\nof the parts of Terezin I never stepped across, because I had no business to be there. I\nmay not even allowed to be there for all I know. So you stuck where you belonged, and\nwhere I had some reason to be. And my reasons to be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the\nstudy place, the first stage of my stay there. And spent the time there.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: We had to walk a long distance from the train. Later, I think they extended the train\ntracks, because when -- eventually right outside of Hamborg caserne, there was a fence,\nand the train tracks that was visible to my -- later on I saw people come and go, those\n[indecipherable] my activities during the day. But I don\u2019t think in our time we got that\nclose. We had to walk, I think a half an hour [indecipherable] what. But there was a\nparade of people marching, and I followed the crowd, and I moved along, and my legs\nheld up, and that was it. So it didn\u2019t leave as an impression of a torturous rite. I don\u2019t\nknow what id -- had no idea what I was in for. See, adults in all likelihood have more\nuncertainties and more concerns for -- they knew who they left behind, what they left\nbehind, rumors, all of that. So they\u2019re walking with a different attitude that I -- I was a\nchild again, not -- be -- being protected and being ignorant helped. So I walked. But I did\nnot, you know, find that, you know, gruesome or onerous. I may have been tired, as a\nchild, but moved along, you know. I was prodded along, and that was it. So I -- that part,\nin some sense I skipped easier than settling into the place.",
        "A: There was a registration process, which I don\u2019t recall being involved, maybe Miss Malka\nPollaczek took care of, maybe my brother took care of it. Vaguely I recall something,\nstanding on lines. Lot of line standing in Terezin in general. Lining for food, was a line\nalways. Morning line-up sometimes. Evening I think also. So there were lines, so -- but at\nthe -- the registration p -- part, again I -- I -- being a child, you -- I take it for granted you\nstand in line, or you do it, what you were told to do, so -- so it never left a big impact on\nme, or impression, as other people find that -- was very cold when we arrived in\nFebruary. And again, as I mentioned, for how we survived overall cold with inadequate\nclothing, in all likelihood, pretty impressive. Course I went -- we visited in 1996, Terezin,\nwas also February, by chance, and was bitter, bitter cold with a winter jacket, and with\ngloves and a scarf. And tell my wife that not see how I could have done that so many\nyears before, but I did.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no --",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall anything like that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall any of that, I mean I don\u2019t know whether there was or\nthere wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: So, I mean I can\u2019t be a witness for that. I more recall was the daily routine.",
        "A: The food line-up, I recall. All of us had a ration card for the month, and each of us had a\nlittle metal bowl and a spoon. How I, as a young child in 1944, held onto that without\nlosing it -- I believe I didn\u2019t lose it, I still wonder. Because nowadays a lot of school kids\ncan\u2019t keep their lunch card for one day, or other tickets, or so, and that mu -- mean -- it\nwas [indecipherable] my survival. In order to get food you need the bowl, you need the\ncard. And I never lost the card.",
        "A: Carried it with me, or put it back in the barrack when I wa -- was through.",
        "A: But I have again these images of walking around at the -- at the serving time, with a\nspoon and a bowl, and lining up. And there was a strategy of where to line up, and when\nto line up, because the main meal often contained like a barley soup. And if you came\nearly you got the water, if you came at the end you got nothing. If you want to get water\nand barley, which had the most substance, you had to be positioned in the right time of\nyour line-up, the people positioned themselves, and I recall always people jockeying for\nposition where to go, partly because of what you get. And I was part of that jockeying.",
        "A: I sensed it, yeah, I knew this, I knew that, I was [indecipherable] to become -- after\nawhile I become streetwise. And I was again told -- but that was part of my job, to be\nthere on time, at the right time, the right place to get a better serving. There were times I\ncame late. There were times I came too early. But every can\u2019t be in the middle,\nobviously. But that whole -- not tension, that whole -- at -- at -- attention, too, and focus\non getting your food or so, became part of your daily routine.",
        "A: You know, have your bowl and have your food and have your line-up. Like it was a time\nconsuming affair through three times --",
        "A: Clipped off a piece -- I think they were --",
        "A: Yes, piece of paper I think that little sections to --",
        "A: -- to clip [indecipherable] make it 90 little coupons, and took -- each day took three.",
        "A: Outside, outside.",
        "A: In the courtyard.",
        "A: I think ate outside, and sometimes inside. But they out -- the courtyard was it -- a place\nwhere again, you saw [indecipherable] one photograph, that was the kind of scene you\ncould remember. All Jewish people in -- interned people who were there, with coats and\nthe star on their jackets were serving the food, and then [indecipherable] people who\nknew who you were, you know? And it was a daily routine. The food wasn\u2019t very much\nfood to eat. With black bread, with cok -- grain coffee called ersatz coffee, which kids got\ntoo. The barley soup, several times a week there was horsemeat, and vegetables. Now,\none vegetable which lasted for me after the war, as well as a -- we called a\n[indecipherable] initially, 1s a -- something which young people don\u2019t know, now we call\nthem green beans, but they were used to call string beans. Now, string beans had a lot of\nstrings in the one they served. You ate, and you had your mouth, basically you had the\nfeel of those greens, whatever you got, and then the mouth full of these strings, which\nyou couldn\u2019t chew, you couldn\u2019t digest, and you spit them out, or so [indecipherable].\nThat was my concept of eating string beans. So after the war, when it was served, I\ncouldn\u2019t eat them for awhile. Because they also, still in 40\u2019s, they still had some strings,\nnot as much string or so. So that was the kind of food, was not very wholesome, but it\nkept me going.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall feeling hungry, but was pretty standardized meal, no, you know, special\nfeatures.",
        "A: Pretty routine, but you went -- that was, again, became the norm, and you -- you took\nwhat you got and you went on line in order to get your food, that was -- you came every\nday, you ate this, and --",
        "A: -- your rations were adequate enough to keep going. I wasn\u2019t working, so I was kind of,\nyou know, wandering around most of the day. And -- but the -- the food item was an\nimportant part of the day. And having protect your bowl and your ration coupon was an\noccupation, apparently.",
        "A: My brother did --",
        "A: -- he was old enough, he was put in some work activity, like messenger.",
        "A: He served as a messenger. Deliver internal -- they had -- see, Terezin was organized as a\nfunctioning concentration camp with certain activities, with some semblances of\nnormalcy, and the -- again, the Jewish council had to administer a law from the detail, not\nthe [indecipherable] principles, and people were assigned work, and were assigned to do\ncertain activities. So my brother did work as a messenger, kept him busy, but I basically\nwandered around the camp.",
        "A: My sister a little less, I think also -- she also did. My recollection is that, you know, I\nplayed soccer with a tin can, that was my toy, kick the tin can. That was really my\noutdoor activity. This woman, Malka Pollaczek -- Malka -- married [indecipherable]\nPollaczek, Malka Weinmann was moved to administer a children\u2019s home in relatively\nnice quarters, in fact, was one very attractive building that they converted to a home for\nchildren, and she was the administrator for it. And after she moved to that place, she\nfound the means to bring me to that place as well if I wanted to, or -- or so. Of course it\nwas a little better condition, better food they served, lard as part a supplement of the food.\nWhere there was [indecipherable] only for children, as we were, loose children at the\nchildren\u2019s home. And given that we ate kosher, we -- I remember we had a discussion,\nmy brother, my sister and I, whether I should go to that home and -- because the\nattraction was eating lard. And so first of all, I -- I di -- wasn\u2019t eager to separate anyhow,\nbut that [indecipherable] she approached and she thinks it\u2019s good for me, I\u2019 Il be better\noff, nicer physical environment and better food, that [indecipherable] my interest, so we\nconsulted a rabbi, the rabbi said yes, go ahead, under the circumstances. Go there and eat\nthere, because you have a better chance of survival. So in answer to your question,\nwhether the food was ample, it really was a consideration for me to get better food, with\nmy interest, or so. So I moved to the children\u2019s home quarters, and -- but I did go visit my\nbrothers. That was further away from Hamborg caserne, so I had to cross over one -- a\nbig courtyard to get from here to there, and I wandered during the day, whenever I felt\nlike, or [indecipherable] it is. So I had had more space than before, and I did wi -- as a\nfunctional walk, I didn\u2019t explore the town, or so. So life moved on, and --",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes, yes --",
        "A: -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these camps,\nalthough the food was not prepared under kosher auspices, ate what they could eat, which\nwas not -- definitively not kosher like. Pig meat if they had given it, or horsemeat, or this\nsort. So -- and all I could do then, eat the horsemeat. I mean, the soup may have had\nhorsemeat content in there, but it\u2019s -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be\neaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, so it became a issue. That\u2019s why I had to -\n- we had to debate it, or discuss it. And I remember that discussion [indecipherable] no,\nof what should we do, and then we consulted the local rabbi over there, and\n[indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me a ruling that it\u2019s permissible, and I should go,\nand it\u2019s in my interest to do so. So I knew enough about that as well, my brothers knew\nmore -- my brother knew more, my sister knew more. So it became a legitimate\ndiscussion issue, but --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: After awhile -- no, after awhile -- but no, after awhile it was okay, yes.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t think I had a great abhorrence. And most probably kids don\u2019t really know\nwhat they\u2019re eating anyhow, once it\u2019s served.",
        "A: No, the issue was the underlying principle.",
        "A: You know, so no, that. I\u2019m sorry, that was your question. I did not sense it was, you\nknow, just didn\u2019t taste good, or th -- I didn\u2019t put up a battle subsequently of saying no, I\ndon\u2019t, that\u2019s not for me.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very close -- lived. We were associated very close\nto the transport. Outside there was a big fence, a metal fence, and a major part of the day\nI spent around that fence watching the activity of the train depot. A lot of them -- the\narrivals I saw. And when the arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not\nonly I, other people standing over there, where they from? Cause sometimes they came\nfrom towns close by. Or from relatives they had, even if they\u2019re from a dif -- different\ncountry. So that people were identified, and the Czech group came in, so the people said,\noh not for me, I don\u2019t know anybody. Or the Danish came, late at the end of the thing,\nsame story. So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some you knew, so that\nthis came a discussion point, and people tried to see whether they knew anybody. And\nthey came from Holland, it was a big excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults\nmet acquaintances, or even relatives, and I was part of the -- the watching scenery and\ntaking it in, but not -- no -- I had met -- I never met -- met anybody who I knew,\nobviously, or anybody who was look -- looking for me. Although subsequently I have to\nmention to you, some distant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had\ncontact with them. So the [indecipherable] contact with us, obviously. Did I know people\nwere leaving? I saw transports too, but what 1t meant -- you see, two way traffic, all\nright? But the injection of new coming -- I did sense, of the people with whom I dealt\nwith, that they weren\u2019t there any more after awhile. So there was a [indecipherable]\nwhether people made friendships or so, it\u2019s different -- different friendships with people\nare there for two months, or three months, and fending for themselves, and then they\ndisappear. You become acquaintance, and then you know somebody\u2019s name, and\nsuddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, and he is no longer there. I had that sense\nof coming, going, people moving in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no\nidea. Where they came from was the curiosity to be discovered. And 1n line-ups -- in the\ntime of day we had line-ups, the different groups lined up near the fences, so that\nconversations started taking place, and you started picking up, you know, different\nlanguages. Danish sing-song, and as a kid started making fun, or trying to imitate, and\nlearning different phrases from people. But I\u2019d never picked up the language, okay? But\nthere as a lot of interact -- not lot, there was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how\nlong it took to wait, and we saw different nationalities, and different languages, and kind\nof came [indecipherable] curious what was going on. So there was more -- I think the\narrivals left a bigger impact on me than the departures, because I had no idea where\npeople are going. I knew where they came from. And you -- suddenly you sit next to the\nDanes, and you sit next to the Hungarians when they came at the end. But we were not\nallowed to mix, and we -- there really was a fence between the nationalities, unless they\nput them in the same caserne. So I became more aware of the change of population of\nWesterbork over time, but the immediate group of people whom -- who I deal with, my\nbrother and my sister, Malka Weinmann and her husband, midway were shipped out to\nAuschwitz, cause she was more Dutch, and he was more -- he was Czech originally. So\nthey categorized him, he came under her auspices, and she had other potential\n[indecipherable] I\u2019m not clear why she survived, but she did. Anyway, that part I -- that\none part of the middle of our stay, he was shipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of\nhave a image of her being sad for one period of there, but could have been anything, or\nso, but later on she told me it was -- what was happening.",

So my brother didn\u2019t know\nexactly, but he says, when you were a child, you had frequent whooping cough, so maybe\nour parents protected you more or so.

So where that was, know, a stabilizing feature for me, or not, in the\nlikely, yes. But as a child I certainly don\u2019t recall that I was looking for, you know, a place\nwhere I had to be safe, and only with them or anybody else.

And in fact my brother recently showed me that they had\nannouncement sheets, they -- the person who was organizing that service send out an\nannouncement to somebody else, be aware that next week or some of this sort, is the bar-\nmitzvah celebration of this young boy, Leo Sigmann, and make, know, announce it to\nwhoever it is, that will take place on Saturday morning.",

People\nhappened to have one set, not going to give it away, necessarily. Turns out that a Czech\nperson had two sets. One a traveling set, was this regular one, which he brought along, so\nhe gave it to my brother. Very, very small phylacteries. And typically, the ins -- writings\ninside the tefillin are in parchment, and the very small ones had to write very small\nletters. Typically, typically they are defective.

So we were never put in any of\nthe transports, because of that status, not because we were children, because they didn\u2019t\ndifferentiate, they put the children on there as well, plenty of them. But, at the end of the\nwar they had already in I think the fall of \u201944, they had after this propaganda episode, the\nRed Cross again had a deal with the Swiss people [indecipherable] Swiss authorities had\na deal for transporting people to stu -- Switzerland in exchange for trucks and tools, who\nknows what. And money, I think. So, a number of people were eligible to go, and rumors\nspread, or evers know, spread that pi -- that this was happening, people ought to be\nsigning up. And they had certain categories people who were eligible, and we cate --\nunder our categories we [indecipherable] because we had Swiss relatives maybe they\nthought my par -- my mother lives there, who knows what. Anyway, were eligible to go,\nand we were -- kind of suggested we could go. So we consulted with different people,\nincluding these other relatives of my mother, which was -- and there was a lot of\nsuspicion, and our name was not put on that train. Must have been in the fall of \u201944.\nPeople had arrangements, see th -- whoever was suspicious had arrangement of giving\nback mailings with codes of -- if it 1s correct, they write -- some words, or some style, or\nwhat have you. If it\u2019s not correct, they would do something different. When the letters\ncame back, they actually came from Switzerland, the packages were sent from\nSwitzerland, so that train of, I think 11 -- 1200 people left, and I -- my brother and sister\ncould have been on that train, but we missed the bo -- train.",

We were\nnot eld -- we -- eligible because [indecipherable] workers, had to be of working age, at\nleast I wasn\u2019t, and so we\u2019re not eligible. But in \u201945, there was another opportunity if you\nwere going to Swiss tr -- [indecipherable] or -- or Freedom train, and for that one we\nwere eligible, and we did sign up. Now, that train never left, but ne -- wer -- there -- was\ndestined to go to a gas chamber. Many people don\u2019t know that, Theresienstadt had a gas\nchamber, but Terezin does -- fortunately it was never used, cause they wanted to save the\ntravel time and distance of the trains, for that time they wanted to use the trains for their\nown war purposes, or [indecipherable]",

But towards the end, since I\nhung around that fence at the -- near th -- near the railroad, watching the railroad tracks\non one side, and the movement of activity on the other side, there were ki -- more and\nmore people were standing around, and they were kind of coming instant war reporting\ncommentators, because by the sound of where certain cannons went off, or airplanes were\nflying, they were able to tell, or the -- they thought they could tell whether it\u2019s the allied\nforces or whether they were the Germans. And as a standee next to that fence, I was kind\nof coming -- hearing about, know, the forces against the Nazis are coming closer to here.\nAnd that came -- gave momentum as the days increased, whether -- was -- must have\nbeen April I assume, or so, but I can tell. Also we saw German trucks moving out\ndifferent kind of German soldiers, w-we had [indecipherable] with the German soldiers,\nbut there was more movement of people [indecipherable] going and -- and kind of what\nyou found out after that they were regrouping and escaping. And more people were\nhanging around that fence rather than working, wherever they was doing. So there was a\nvery different atmosphere towards the end of the war than before. That was the most\nnoticeable part, and this -- listening to these comments of -- they\u2019re coming, they\u2019re not,\nthey\u2019re further away, closer by, and judging of a sort, I got a sense that -- wh -- since I\nthen knew right -- it was a war, everything else, that this war 1s now reaching a different\nstage. So that was very much in the atmosphere, in the air, and the conversation, and I\nwas there listening --",
        "A: -- and absorbing, and most probably even parroting what was happening. Different kinds\nof transports came the end, I think the Danes and the Hungarians came pretty late in the\ngame. And -- kind of -- so new people, you never heard -- you -- heard before. The Danes\ncame very late. So new languages, but the -- and they were different appearance, too.\nNow, turns out that Theresienstadt also got a whole group of people from the death\nmarches, were -- ended up in Theresienstadt, but they never ended up to our place, they\nended up in -- that\u2019s why people ask me about, do you ever meet those people, no. Matter\nof fact, I know now some people who says they were in Theresienstadt at liberation. And\ntheir description of what they saw was very different than what I lived. But they lived in\nthe small compound, away from where we were anyhow -- not that -- not\n[indecipherable] I\u2019ve seen everybody, but I would have [indecipherable] I seen coming\nin, I would have seen very different type of person coming in, straggling in, decimated\npeople.

        "A: -- or so. So anyway, the momentum that\u2019s -- the scene was changing, the war scene was\nchanging was evident, and was part of the discussion. And that I do recall being there,\nparticipating, absorbing. On again, on a daily, incremental basis. By the end of it, you\nknow what was happening. And I recall the final days or so where the troops of the\nGerman Nazis were leaving, and for good luck threw hand grenades over the fence for us,\nfor now a gift to us, who ducked and moved on. But that\u2019s already before we got it, that\u2019s\na good sign, because they\u2019re good-bye, and good riddance. So that was the approach\ntowards the end of the war which changed the mood.

People in -- when they lined up, and they had different -- [indecipherable] I\noverheard conversations, but I was part of it, eventually starts some [indecipherable] so I\nunderstood there was a war, and the Jews were targets and victims, because obviously we\nwere -- most of them were Jews, okay?

What it meant being,\nyou know, who da -- who decides where -- obviously I was not fully in command of that,\nwhether it was allied troops, or even the names of it, but that -- but there was a -- the\nNazis, or the Germans, basically, versus other people, and that there\u2019s a battle going on,\nand you know, you heard these reports about the airplanes flying, and sounds of bangs\nand booms, and people interpreting all of that, I -- I started ab-absorbing that, over time.\nIt wasn\u2019t a one day event either, remember --",
        "A: -- it was several weeks of time. And I -- again, the fact there were more people at the\nfence than before, I didn\u2019t know why, but it was a changed feature a-as well. So that\u2019s\nhow I kind of participated in the approach of liberation.",

Well,\nthen you sense that these people, the bad people are going out of your life, you know?

You understood what\nwas happening, that end was coming. And then, see these mass, you know, departures, it\nalso was consistent. So now the people -- question of when will [indecipherable] people\nmost probably listen to some kind of radio or other features, then they -- that\u2019s -- word\nspread amongst each other. I was obviously not party to that. And -- but it sounded more\nreal that what other people were talking about, and I kind of integrated that into my\nabsorption, whatever I was thinking.",
        "A: You have to re-recollect that when I child hears things, it is not all as logical as what\u2019s\nbeing presented, or as totally comprehensible. But they ab -- do absorb a change of tone,\na change of discussion topics, and that\u2019s what I was capturing.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: First of all, they came and obviously jubilant, you know. Was a -- and the people\nthemselves were kind of very excited and they handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and\nchocolates to people, I think to us, to kids, and in that respect they were very, quote, kind,\nand a breath of fresh air. Right? Soldiers who were friendly rather than soldiers who were\nguarding people who -- and people embraced them, and touched them, it was a different -\n- you saw that some whatever it was, new -- liberators, but that\u2019s what -- that\u2019s what they\nleft the impression. In that respect they were most pr -- most probably very good. I did\nknow, and I can see that image too, of rampaging through the barrack to the caserne of\nthe -- you know, where people were crowded, and ripping off watches of women. I saw\nthat scene, apparently they also pillaged and raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not\nobviously, but I just didn\u2019t see, or didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s later, but the\ngrabbing off watches of people who somehow managed to retain them during the war\nperiod is -- was very kind of shocking to me. But they di -- transformed very quickly, the\nrole of the being behind the fences versus being free, and more movement. I think the\nfence came down, or -- but we still had a fence, I remember was the -- suddenly you saw\nthe German soldiers, whoever the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in\nTheresienstadt were now being required to go with wheelbarrows and picking things up,\nand fixing things up, and breaking things down, and they were being beaten by some\nformer German people who ta -- trying to put -- change their roles in order to get more\nprivileges, and that was going on and people were cheering on and pointing out, you\nknow, hit them harder, etcetera, this sort, get even with them. So the -- again, that was a\nvery different atmosphere what you saw before. So that\u2019s the Russians kind of influence,\na very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before, and now they\nbecame -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis,\nor Germans, and Germans beating up their compatriots, or so, and with full vigor, I mean,\njust reversed direction. But that -- the transition from being occupied versus being\nliberated, and the change took [indecipherable] very, very quickly. And very noticeable,\nand to -- very quick. Now in May, the eighth, ninth, we were liberated, and by June\nalready we were out.",
        "A: Now, a lot of people didn\u2019t make it to later. There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a\nquarantine, but the most typhus epidemic took place in that other quarter where these\nother people who were in the death marches who made it, barely made it, ended up. I\ndon\u2019t know whether in our particular compound, they did it by caserne to caserne, I don\u2019t\nknow what -- we were allowed to leave in June. Again, some people say you couldn\u2019t\nhave left in June because there was a general quarantine. Well, I know I left in June, you\nknow, I mean --",
        "A: I don\u2019t care what the historian books say on that. People verif -- generalize from the\ngeneric fact, and apply it to everybody.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after the war, there was a very st -- quick\neffort to identify, locate people who survived. And whoever did this, might -- the\nRussians, or others, made a list of the survivors in tha -- in Theresienstadt, and people\nfrom different localities contacted the authorities somewhere, that was designated, maybe\nRed Cross [indecipherable] I don\u2019t recall, obviously. And we had relatives who survived\nthe war in Holland, who were in hiding during the war, in the broadest [indecipherable]\nwere kind of somewhat distant, but in the context of the time they very close to my\nfamily, partly they\u2019re -- they were raised in the old country, very close in the same\ncourtyard, effectively, so they were like very close cousins, brother, sister type\nrelationship. Anyhow, that relative knew that, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch\nrelatives they had, and went around finding out in Westerbork most probably, with the\nDutch authorities, where are the S-Sigmann family, my parents, my brothers and my\nsister and myself. And eventually they found out that the only ones who are surviving\nfrom their records was us three. And they got in touch with the Theresienstadt people,\nwho went and got in touch with Malka Weinmann, and through us, and saying, oh, yo-\nyou will come back, you have a place to go -- the people who were released from these\ncamps had a -- a place to go. We had a place to go because somebody was claiming us.",
        "A: Had we not had that we would have been again, rerouted somewhere to a displaced\npersons camp, or hang around later in Theresienstadt, I don\u2019t know what would have\nhappened. But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come\nto them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber,\nwhose parents survived. So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were\nclaiming her. So we all went back on the train from Terezin to the American section, you\nknow, Czechoslovakia kind of was split into different regions whoever liberated them.\nOne half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think. And we\ntook a train from Terezin to Pilsen, and maybe took a plane from Pilsen to Amsterdam, I\nthink a French plane, was probably a army transport plane. And we stayed a few days or\nso with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her. And you ask what attachment,\nthat was probably -- I -- we sensed that. And well, a very different life suddenly, you\nknow, plates, and tables, and food that we never had eaten before. White bread was\nserved, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread. I had a tin can of anchovy\npaste, I don\u2019t know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little\nthing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips. Spent a few\ndays over there, till they discussed with -- how to get us to these relatives, the Bergers,\nwho themselves spent the war years separated from their children, daughter and son. The\ndaughter, son and parents were in three different locations, and they were --",
        "A: They survived, yes, they survived. And then I rejoined living with them after, for one\nyear or so, till other family members elsewhere in the world started looking for the\nSigmann family, and locating us, and discovered we were the only survivors. So we spent\na year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- from June to July, or June of ni -- June to\nJune, from \u00b045 to 46, and being -- lived in Amsterdam.",
        "A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they\nthemselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their\nlife. So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what\npeople were used to. I mean, s-sitting at a table with the family rather than in a\ncompound. Cooking, baking, washing. You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were\nhidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in Indonesia before, and I think\nthey lived at Amsterdam. And they lived behind a partition wall for several years.\nCouldn\u2019t go out in daytime. Didn\u2019t know where their daughter and son was -- were. Their\ndaughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a\nquote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of Amsterdam\nas a open house help, au pair. It\u2019s -- her name is Miriam. And she was there, and -- very\ninteresting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and\neach one has his own tale of escape and saving. But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have\nbeen around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people\nwere very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com\n-- can\u2019t do anything on a Sunday. That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on\nSaturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath. But they were very\ndevout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too. They --\nin order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their\nown children, so they couldn\u2019t say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the\nvery devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays,\nto keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh\n-- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us\nabout, it was kind of -- and they\u2019re very nice people. We met them after they came, they\nwere very close. But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what\nthey went through, was both interesting, and it was very common. Their son, who was a\ntall fellow, was in hiding in a little attic, in a little town up in -- in the country, again\ndidn\u2019t see daylight, public daylight for several years. And he was an artist and he made\nwooden pins for the underground, emblems. I believe that\u2019s how he spent his time. And\nso the reconstituting of life in Amsterdam was -- we were part of it, but we\n[indecipherable] we were visiting. These Bergers are interesting people because they used\nto have a restaurant, kosher restaurant in Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently,\nbefore the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their\napartment was gone, all their belongings were gone. They couldn\u2019t -- they knew who they\ngave it, they couldn\u2019t get it back, even because they survived. People denied, apparently\nthat they had received anything. They had to start from scratch, in very small quarters, we\nlived in very, very small quarters. There was no shower or bathtub in the house. We had a\nlittle metal bathtub that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most\nprobably too, and we went to public baths. This was the life. But for them it was a --\nhappy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through,\nand remember that. Of course they would -- had the restaurant before, they\u2019re still -- so\nthey\u2019re getting the old customers coming back, come and eat. Some widowers, or single\npeople, lost their family. So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served\nthings. Whether they paid or not, I don\u2019t know. But they kind of resumed the sort of role\n[indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the\ntable. You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now\nwe had one experience, people had very different experience. The hiding, some survived,\nbut only, you know, one person. And some people were traumatized, and completely\ntroubled. And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to\ntalk or his despair -- despair. And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really --\nwhen that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the room, the small\nquarters. And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. So those kind of\nthings, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in Amsterdam, it was --\nit was not a normal return to life, again. These people, the Bergers, at this restaurant, also\nkept kosher, obviously. And basically ate dairy, because they didn\u2019t have any dishes and\ncutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only\nmeat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. But because of their hospitality\nreputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed\nthrough Holland from Canada, or from England, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher,\nstayed in their house, or ate in their house. But they brought their rations over to the\nBergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many\nyears eating meat. But didn\u2019t have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates. So the cans were\nwarmed up on the stove, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat.\nThat\u2019s the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a\nelegant restaurant with all the trappings of a restaurant, having to serve their own in this\nway. But they made -- they made the transition, we\u2019ll open up another restaurant a\nnumber of years.",

So eventually I fit it in to my category, and -- but that was a pretty\ndynamic -- I use the word dynamic selectively, seeing people were really -- had to re-\nestablish themself, that some people could make it. And also it was very much evident\npeople want get out of Europe as -- or Holland as fast as possible, many people, they --\nthe first opportunity to get out, and especially the children. They sh --",
        "A: There -- they -- once they get their [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- out of the country, out of Europe. Not a good place to be. Partly out of memory, but\npartly out of experience. So it was a sizeable exodus. Felt wa -- was -- weren\u2019t too many\npeople who survived, okay? But there was a noticeable exodus of people who left to\nEngland, people who left to isr -- Palestine. And some people stayed. And some elderly\nparents -- pa -- no -- reluctantly but willingly encouraged their children to leave. And\nsome people couldn\u2019t stop the children that want to get out of there as fast as possible.\nAnd that a -- again, I absorbed that part of the scene.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: I did leave, as you know.",
        "A: Right, but for different reasons than what was occurring. Th -- when I say people who\nwere eager to leave were the older people [indecipherable] not sure, take these two\nchildren of my relatives, Bergers, Miriam and Manfred, they got out as fast, but they\nwanted to leave right away, I mean they were -- imagine not being with their parents for\nseveral years, and May, June they see them, and they wanted to get out, on -- go to\nPalestine. The parents did not -- were not encouraging that right away, but reluctantly\nthey yielded, so right after the high holidays, they left on the illegal transport, where they\nwere put in Cypress, they ga -- had a long journey. But -- so that age bracket and above,\nthere was a much greater personal decision to leave Europe, or leave Netherlands. They\nboth went to Palestine. One of them there right now. The tragedy was that the brother\nended up in Palestine. When the state was established, he was in the army, and he was\nkilled by a convoy in the protection of Jerusalem during the War of Independence. Was\njust -- had just become engaged to a beautiful Yemenite girl, and so now that\u2019s -- the\nfamily had to absorb that loss after being spared the other hurdles of the war, ended up a\nvictim in Palestine - Israel. Parents not fully revere -- recovered from that wound,\nwhereas the war wounds were healing, that wound kind of was pretty difficult for them to\ndeal with. But other people also were leaving. And in contrast to the pre-war, which I\ndon\u2019t recall too much, Westerbork or Terezin, there I did have friends. I visited homes\nlike in more normal circumstances. But again, 1t was somewhat temporary, because\npeople I dealt with, they moved out to other countries suddenly, okay? And myself also\nleft. But it was a different -- but I do know the names of people who were there. We\njoined the youth organization, I think it was the precursor of Bnei Akiva. My brother was\nolder, he was allowed to join, I tagged along with him, and given that was much choice,\nnot too many other children around, they let me come. And we went to hikes and\nactivities. So we had a little more normal type of event, of youth organizations that\nobviously you didn\u2019t have before, and some of the names of the people from that period I\nstill know by name. And I\u2019ve discovered recently one is in t -- married, you know, with\nfamilies in Toronto, and one lives in Israel, and one here, one no longer lives. But that\nkind of life became more normalized. I went to school in Amsterdam, Jewish school, and\nes -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either synagogue, with people. So it kind of --\nbut even those teachers started leaving. We had the teacher, and the middle of the year\nthey went to England. Of course, it was not a -- people weren\u2019t on the firm ground, or so.\nSo we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural for me to leave, because that\u2019s what other\npeople were doing for all kinds of reasons, which I may not have been fully aware. But it\nwas not my decision, of sorts, because my other relatives, who were closer in relative\nranking that the Bergers, my father\u2019s brother lived the United States, and they were also\nrelated to the Bergers so they were in touch, wanted us to join him. And my mother\u2019s\nsister in Zurich wanted us to join them. So we were wanted, but we were kind of being\npulled in two different directions. And the decision was that the two boys would go to\nNew York, and the girl would go to Zurich. Whether that\u2019s wi -- wise decision or not 1s\nnot for me to say.",
        "A: The relatives.",
        "A: I mean, both had a loo -- a genuine eagerness to want to absorb us, and you know, take\ncare of us as children without parents. And they decided, not to divide the spoils, but they\nthought that boys would be better off in education, particularly Jewish education in\nUnited States, and the girl would fit in better in Switzerland. My aunt had a -- uncle had a\ndress store, an elegant dress store, and she could perhaps work her way into that. But\nanyway, we were split, which my sister to this day finds horrendous. And she found it\nvery surprising that it was proposed and implemented.",
        "A: It was difficult, yes, yes. And especially those were days where na -- ba -- people didn\u2019t\nhave telephone conversations, you know, you wrote to each other, kept in touch that way.",
        "A: I have a brother.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- well, well, my -- my uncle from Switzerland, that\u2019s the -- my aunt -- my si -- mother\u2019s\nsister\u2019s husband came to visit us in \u201946, okay? Very nice, brought clothing and candy and\ntreated us, and -- very nice, and told us about the family linkages, and all of that, and so it\nwas either total stranger -- we knew the name of the family, the -- these -- okay.",
        "A: We hadn\u2019t dealt with them in years, obviously. And the United States family, all I knew\nwas my father\u2019s brother, my uncle. But I had never seen him. I don\u2019t think my brother\nsaw him either. And they were again, far away, the United States was far, far away. So\nthat was a new change in our life status of being separated, moved away from Holland,\nand a new stage of our life had to begin. But again, the intentions certainly were well-\nintentioned. Whether is was appropriate under the circumstances, but that set the course\nfor our lives, and with the ca -- impl -- consequence. My sister married somebody from\nSwitzerland, we ended up in United States. And were raised over there by my uncle and\naunt, who were very generous to absorb two more children in a household of six children.",
        "A: They had six.",
        "A: And raised us effectively under their auspices, so I\u2019m certainly appreciative --",
        "A: In New York City.",
        "A: Mm, I -- wa -- that -- my memory of my father was vague. I -- my -- the only memory of\nmy father is this -- the last scene, sitting on his lap with tefillin on his head. That\u2019s not a\nassociation, that\u2019s a picture, a photograph. No, I don\u2019t -- I was too young to make that\nsort of linkage.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",

        "A: -- kid who went through the war. Went through the war. So, of a helpful, and --",
        "A: -- no, and some of the children were closer in my age, so I could relate to them, and some\nwere close to my brother. They fi -- we fitted in after awhile, and at the time we were\narrive already, the older children kind of were started to move out of the house. So, the\nfamily was not as large on a daily basis.",
        "A: It still was large, I mean, and totally appreciative obviously that I had a home. Because\notherwise, you know, that\u2019s a big problem after the war, people were homeless. Some\npeople had, you know, lost their parents, and their siblings, or what have you, and\nnowhere to go. And their immediate, or s -- distant relatives were also killed during the\nwar, so I was relatively better off.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, they spoke German, I understood German. I don\u2019t know where exactly I learned\nGerman, but I learned German somewhere along the line. Of course, at home we did not\nspeak German, Dutch was -- probably -- the parents spoke Yiddish. But that was a\ncommon language, and then I start --",
        "A: Oh, it was very massive, oh yes, it was very massive. And the whole -- well, generally,\nafter the war, a lot of things were brand new for me. I mean, the food was brand new. I\nhad eaten -- I had not eaten oranges till I -- I think got in the -- either in Amsterdam or\ngot in the plane and --",
        "A: -- of -- or so. When I came off the boat, came here on the boat, people offered me a\nbanana, I didn\u2019t know how to open it. I mean, it\u2019s a strange food.",
        "A: Or so -- so, y -- generally even in Holland after the war, there were all kinds of new ec --\nexperiences or so, about food, or otherwise. I remember with my bo -- my uncle from\nSwitzerland, who took us out and treated us to vanilla ice cream. And the pungency of\nthat vanilla taste is still in my mouth, I mean, I just -- it\u2019s very different today, doesn\u2019t\nhave the same intensity of taste, but it was a very strong taste, a flavor which I never had,\nor don\u2019t recall, I may have had it when I was five or six. But from five to six to nine was\na long time. So those things kind of, you know, were all sensations that we experienced.\nThere was an ho -- another interesting thing was I was saying of -- people were kind of\ncoming out of the woodwork in some sense. The people who were in hiding got out right\naway, from the camps. Those who had a place to go had right away -- some straggled in,\ndepends where they were kept, in which camp. So it was an ongoing process of people\ncoming, and eventually people leaving. Was a lot of young people, particularly children\nhad to be taken out of convents or hiding places, and was a big battle sometimes, you\nknow, older sisters f -- survived. [indecipherable] little sister was in the convent in\nBelgium, went through the effort, identified everything [indecipherable] and that little\ngirl refused to come. Again, in this Berger household we had a lot of traffic, but people --\nthere was a home, people came across. So I in some sense absorbed more of that than I\nwould have otherwise. And I remember those two sisters finally successful in getting out,\nthis whole discussion of getting their little sister out, finally getting their sister out, and\nthe sister rebellious, she wants to go back to the sisters in Belgium, rather than the sisters\nin Holland. And I think eventually she had -- had -- had to yield it, they got -- bring her\nback. You know, the chief rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Herzog went through country to country,\nalso through Holland, trying to save those children, invoking his position in dealing with\nthe clergy, and the church. And had very great difficult time, I remember him there with\nhis top hat, and making, you know, talking about his experiences. That was an event. So,\nit was -- th-the post-war reconstitution was very much an activity of the country, of the\nJewish community. And therefore was a lot of activity and movement, and was not a --\nyou know, a stable community, were never -- never really became stable, because\nHolland as you know, lost a very high proportion of it\u2019s Jewish population.\nUnderestimated the people talk about [indecipherable]. The interesting little side story,\nmy relative, my uncle -- I call him uncle, he was a Berger, had a brother in Palestine, who\nwas a -- ashoe store. And one day he sent a crate of Yaffa oranges to him. And that was a\ncommunion celebration, they handed out these oranges as prizes to people, and\neverybody took those -- an orange for their entire family. And there was the biggest gift\nthey could ever dream of after going through the war, of getting something from\nPalestine, a Yaffa orange. So, I remember we got one too, and it was something, you\nknow, unique. So a lot of feelings were going on in the country, which today people have\nmuch less -- they take a lot of things for granted. Every -- every -- ev -- all these events\nbecame events rather than, you know, part of a routine life. So 1t was, 1n some sense,\nquote, exciting. Because things were really appearing, and I was -- as I was getting older,\nI was a -- absorbing these things much more than anything before [indecipherable]\ncertainly I was a little boy, but already approaching 10 - 11, to move on there. So carry\nback interesting memories of the year in Holland.",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable]",

So it may have been, you know, equal peer\nclass.",
        "A: Like, I never thought of it in these terms, but my -- I -- I went to do what s-s-sc --\nstudents have to do. And so anyway, we went to the United States, a long route, because\nThe Joint was involved in transporting people from one country to another, and so it was\na torturous trip to go from Holland to Antwerp, to end up in Marseilles on the buses and\ntrains, or so, and in fact I saved The Joint, I think, a big bundle because one of the stops,\none of the night st -- overnight stops was a U.S. army camp, and we\u2019re supposed to stay\none night then go on to the next stop and go to whatever quarters we were supposed to\ngo.

But they kne -- they knew our\ntravelogue, or itinerary, and he kept us there till we able to go to the boat to Marseilles.\nSo I think The Joint saved a big bundle, for again, strange reasons. And they took a --\ntook a boat to the United States, a long journey.",

        "A: I went through a -- I went through economics, on to graduate and -- as a major in\ngraduate studies as well, and --",
        "A: Co -- all but dissertation. And worked toward the university for -- or college for nine\nyears, and --",
        "A: Swa -- first at City College for nine years, and then Swarthmore for five years.",
        "A: 1962, in Montreal.",
        "A: After, right.",
        "A: Right, right. By chance, my wife was in Israel the same summer when I was there.",
        "A: And we did meet, but I didn\u2019t know who she was at that time, so two years\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: On the street with a group, she was with a group of youngsters, and I knew some people\nin that group. So I had a conversation, which she recalls, too.",
        "A: In New York, she was in New York.",
        "A: And the rest is all good history. Much, much more favorable chapter.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. She was --",
        "A: She lived in Montreal. She was raised in Montreal --",
        "A: -- and her parents had been there for -- way before the war, so she did not personally\nexperience, nor did her parents --",
        "A: -- directly. Her parents lost --",
        "A: Mont -- raised Montreal, and did not have direct experience with the Holocaust, although\nher parents, her mother did lose some sisters.",
        "A: In Poland, who left -- who remained there. So she had a more normal upbringing.",
        "A: And that -- also the good chapters 1n my life.",
        "A: Four children, and --",
        "A: -- | have nice grandchildren, and a lot of, you know, happy days and times and -- and of\nrewards for surviving.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- definitely the war experience is engraved into me. I mean, I know, I went\nthrough the war, I know I lost my parents and two brothers. So I\u2019m very sensitized to the\nShoah and what happened, part because I lived through it, in my own way. I was not as\ndirectly affected like some other people went through hell. I did not have, you know, my\n-- any numbers carved into me. And I was not beaten up physically, or so, but I certainly\nam a victim of not -- of having had a lost childhood. I mean that never -- right? I knew I\nwas different, but [indecipherable] and the younger ages when I came United States, I\nknew I was not the same everybody else. Other people had parents, other people had\nnormal memories, I had no pictures of my childhood, I had very few concrete episodes,\nno family vacations, except for I went back, you know, to the beach story, but -- so I -- I\nknow I was different, and I was at a young age is especially more sensitive. Once you get\nmarried and have children, you join another category of life. I was more with a similar\ngroup, but the issue where you come from, whether it was raised, or -- know, specifically,\nor underlying, people talk about experiences which I could never talk about. Or show\npictures, or something of this sort, so that respect it affected me, or so, over time I th --\nI\u2019m sure that my sensitivities about the world events or so, must have some roots in my\nexperience as well. I don\u2019t want to link everything who I am, I do -- I don\u2019t want to sou --\nI never wanted to, I don\u2019t intend to psychoanalyze myself, of you know, my behavior or\ngood deeds, or bad deeds, or good habits or bad habits are attributed to the war, and I\ndon\u2019t feel that I have to glean who I am, or attribute who I am to the war experience. I am\nwho I am with that being part of me, but it\u2019s -- certainly it\u2019s a very central part of my\nmemory of -- or so, though fortunately, since 1945, many other events have happened, I\nmean good events have happened, that they have receded, okay, proportionately of my\nlife, I have the good life.",
        "A: Okay? But that doesn\u2019t eliminate --",
        "A: -- what I went through, and awareness of it. I\u2019m a different person, of course, of what I\nwent through. How different, in which ways, very difficult to pinpoint. Obviously, I mean\n[indecipherable] I\u2019d never come to the United States, I mean, that\u2019s [indecipherable] you\nknow, and my wife -- if you go through -- if you go this sort of route, so --",
        "A: Would -- exactly, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting over here right now. So I -- by the nature of the\nanimal, life would be different because of the war in so many ways which I cannot eve --\ntrace. Nor would I know what had happened. You can\u2019t predict -- too parallel life events,\nor so. So Iam who I am, with that being a major part of me.",
        "A: No, he talked very little about his family in general.",
        "A: And talked very, very little about my father and mother. My aunt from Switzerland talked\nmore, oddly enough.",
        "A: -- the one -- the one that\u2019s -- my sister, Lily, right.",
        "A: Not oddly, I think, just different circumstances. And my uncle was much more tight\nlipped about family in general, or -- not to [indecipherable] re us. In part I also think that\nhe -- that\u2019s more speculation than fact, but I feel that maybe even fact, he I think felt\nsomewhat guilty that he did not do more to get my parents out, whether it would be more\nencouraging or physical action. He himself had come to the United States in \u201941 or so, so\nthere were some years involved. I have no idea -- I have no clue how much contact they\nhad. He told us [indecipherable] was very -- always a very -- my -- my father was the\nolder brother, and he always told about his respect and, you know, esteem for him, only\nto talk to him as a younger brother. But he never talked about details of background. But\nhe never talked about his own -- to his own children either, too much. So when I speak to\nmy cousins, his children are so now about -- because they also regret they never pumped\nhim for information just in the family tree. [indecipherable] or so, and his background or\nso. Anyways, the answer to your question is no, very little information about my parents.\nSo that\u2019s another void.",
        "A: How they lived, how they celebrated, how they did things. My brother knows a little bit\nmore, my sister knows bits and pieces, I know very little. That\u2019s certainly a blank\ncompared to other children.",
        "A: Wa -- so again, that -- it\u2019s understandably I was a very little boy, right, so I don\u2019t recall\nwhere -- and my sister mentions to me that for my father\u2019s 40\" birthday he got a electric\nshaver.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know, right? That was a big deal in Holland to get an electric shaver, because\npeople used to use shaving paste --",
        "A: -- to do the beards, so.",
        "A: I choked up a little more, right?",
        "A: In part it\u2019s a symbol of the loss, obviously, but also is the content. I mean, for parents to\nwrite a farewell note to parent -- to the children is not normal, and for a brother to end up\nsaying [indecipherable] which means I will see you again, and never materialized, is a\npainful message to receive, but never follow through. So more emotions may be evoked\nfrom that than describing that they went on a train, and they open up a -- a suitcase in the\ncamp.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there\u2019s things that you would like me to ask which I haven\u2019t answered, or I -- no,\nI wa -- my job was not to know, give you all my thoughts and feelings. I mean, you asked\na number of intriguing questions or so, I think gives you a -- some sense of what the war -",
        "A: -- was -- meant for me, what I -- what little part I played as one individual, and -- well, in\nsome sense our families are like mic-microcosm of one type of --",
        "A: -- Holocaust story, you know. And the implications of it all are serious, you know, let\u2019s\ntalk about millions of people. Here\u2019s a very, you know, quote, normal family that was\nsplit apart.",
        "A: To the extent that I have four children and a family and grandchildren, my two brothers\nwould had equal families, and never experienced any personal fulfillment in this regard,\nand my parents never saw grandchildren, I did. So all the human relationships, and all the\nhuman events, were kind of disrupted. I had a disjointed childhood at best. My brother\nhad consequences of it, my sister are similar, you know, so this is just one family to,\nquote, just one family, and there\u2019s plenty of damage, and I repeat again, I did not\n[indecipherable] go through the personal horrors of people who go through Auschwitz, or\nber -- Buchenwald, and tell horrible stories, you know, on a personal basis or so. But\nthat\u2019s just a kind of little composite story of one family and how it spreads, what\nhappened to us, and how one takes it.",
        "A: Thank you for --",
        "A: Okay, thank you.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: This is a wedding picture of my parents, 1922, in Frankfurt, with the extended family\nthere, and including in the back right behind them, my mother\u2019s sister and her husband,\nRosie Goodman, and Morris Goodman, where my sister went after the war. Next to\nMorris Goodman 1s Pepi Berger, who -- with whom I stayed for one year in Holland, with\nher husband Josef Berger. And next to her is Mendel Siegman, who is my father\u2019s\nbrother, with whose family I stayed, starting in 1946 till 1962, with his wife Suzie\nSiegman, who is not 1n the picture, he wasn\u2019t married yet. This picture went through the\nwar itself, because my cousin carried with him through certain concentration camps, and\nby good circumstances it was finally brought to our attention, so this was salvaged, and\nthis is the kind of big collective origin picture.",
        "A: This is a portrait picture of my mother that was taken, I believe, after her marriage, I\ndon\u2019t know exact dates on this one. And it was this plus the next one from my father, was\ngiven to us by very, very close friends of my mother, who had it in their collection, and\nwhen we came back after the war to United States, they wanted to make sure that we\nhave pictures of our parents, and they enlarged it, and framed it, I believe, and -- and\nhave been with us since. They hang on a wall in our din -- living room.",
        "A: This is the companion picture of my father, also given by the same friends, Hansha Label\nVelk, who were close friends of my mother, and this the only full faced picture I have of\nmy father as an adult after his marriage.",
        "A: On the left is a picture of my mother as a young girl, 1913, must have been 14 years old\nor so, and the [indecipherable] where she was raised in Switzerland. Both this and these\nother pictures are -- giv -- were given to me by my Aunt Rosie from Switzerland, my\nmother\u2019s sister, who had it in her collection. Without her I would not have any pictures of\nmy mother in any stage of her life.",
        "A: The one on the right is 1922, most probably either be -- just before or after she was\nmarried. Again, for -- formal posed picture.",
        "A: This is my picture of my brother, must be a half a year old or so, 1926. And that\u2019s the\nonly picture I have of my brother. My other brother -- this one, ar -- Aron Erik. My other\nbrother Josef Trey, I don\u2019t have any pictures at all. I am -- most probably didn\u2019t have it in\nher collection, or they never found the occasion to give it to me. But that\u2019s the only\nremembrance picture I have of my p -- late brother.",
        "A: This shot at -- 1s a picture of my father with a friend on the beach in Scheveningen. My\nfather is on the right, the taller man, in 1924, just after he was married. And the\nbackground picture of that big circular building is the prominent hotel in Scheveningen to\nthis day, called The Curacao. Until World War two, that\u2019s all existed on the beach as far\nas the visible building, now it is all built up around it, so it doesn\u2019t look as identifiable\nany more. But it\u2019s only snapshot picture I have of my father.",
        "A: This is my mo -- late mother, 1940 picture, the latest picture [indecipherable] really close\nto before she was killed in Auschwitz a few years later. And again, that was given to me\nby my relative. We have -- we carry no pictures with us -- we didn\u2019t carry any pictures\nwith us during the war, obviously, and any family pictures we had we -- either they were\ndisposed or not given to us after the war.",
        "A: These pictures are from 1946, must be early 46, wintertime in Amsterdam, my uncle\nMoritz from Switzerland came to visit us, brought us lots of clothing, which we are\nwearing, and other goodies, and parading through the center plaza of Amsterdam. To the\nleft I am, next is my uncle, and my sister Lily, and my brother Leo. Wasn\u2019t that a nice\nvisit. On the right?",
        "A: Is a picture taken after my sister left, otherwise she would have been in the picture, went -\n- left to Switzerland. In the background, in the center, are my relatives, Pepi and Josef\nBerger with whom I st -- we s -- we stayed for one year in Amsterdam. To the left, the\nwoman with the beret is Malka Weinmann, who kept close to us, both in Amsterdam, and\nwhen she came to United States, stayed with -- friendly with us, on good -- very good\nterms. She is, I think, holding a -- a hand of the little nephew. And the woman on the\nright is a sister of Pepi Berger, who was a Regina Felsen, or Feldrin, who married during\nthe war, and -- to a Dutch person, and she was part of the family as well. So this is a kind\nof contemporary Amsterdam picture. Contemporary 1946.",
        "A: This is the wedding picture of our daughter Dafna with her husband Dani. And next to\nDafna is my wife Gita. And Dafna is holding one of her nephews, Ayal, who is the\nyoungest of our oldest daughter, who is sta -- sitting right be -- standing right behind\nDafna and Dani, that\u2019s Atara, right, and her husband Joel - Jody, right next to her, right.\nAnd their other three children are the boy with the sleeve -- shirts -- shirtsleeve is Ilan,\nshirtsleeve right behind me, right. And on the side, the girl with the white skirt, this is our\noldest granddaughter -- the white skirt at the end, next -- behind my wife Gita.",
        "A: Right. That\u2019s Michal. And in front are our two other grandchildren, one of them is Hadar,\nthe small one, and that -- that\u2019s the four children of Atara and Jody. And next to her is\nShlomit, and the little boy next to me is Yosef, who are the two children, at that time, of\nour daughter Naomi, in back and her husband Ari.",
        "A: Right. This is Naomi, this is Ari. And on back, the last two next to Atara are our son,\nright there, tall fellow is next to a -- next to -- that --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s right. Our son Dov, and his wife Tzviya, right over there. That\u2019s the last family\npicture we had, but there -- since then, we have had, thank God, a few additions in the\nfamily. Atara -- Dafna and Dani had -- to have two children, Amihi and Tahiwa. And\nNaomi had another son, Menachim Benjamin. So thank God the -- is a contrast that they\nhave two wedding pictures, and this 1s the continuity which Hitler tried to destroy, but we\nbeat him.",
        "A: Left is my wife Gita and myself, and on the other s -- on the right is my wife Gita and\nmyself again, different poses and formality. And this is the best part happened to my life\nwhen I met Gita, and she 1s all around superb blessing for all of us. And those are the\nbright chapters, opened with when I met her, and then the family pictures since. So this is\nthe continuity with a major interruption, and some family tragedy between, but thank\nGod that the bright side is that the continuity exists.\nEnd of Tape #7\nConclusion of Interview\n"
