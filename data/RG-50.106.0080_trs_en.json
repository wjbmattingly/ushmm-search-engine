        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Bernard Pasternak, conducted by Esther Finder on\nOctober 22\u2122, 1997, in Rockville, Maryland. This is a follow-up interview to a\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum videotape interview conducted with Bernard\nPasternak on April 20\", 1994. This is tape one, side A. I would like to have you\nspeak to me today a little bit about your liberation and your post-Holocaust\nexperiences. Can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were free, and\nno longer under Nazi control?",
        "Answer: Well, have to give me a couple of seconds, to turn the clock back, to tell\nyou about it. The first thing on the liberation, I noticed a lot of noise and I didn\u2019t\nknow from where the noise is coming. Then I heard people are saying the\nAmericans are here, the Americans are here. But some people who were saying the\nAmericans are here, they were from far away the noise, because inside on the camp\nthere was still SS, try to get people up, to keep on going for the death march, keep\non going. So I could not go any more because of wa \u2014 was very weak. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe have 60 or 65 pounds. So what I did, I saw bodies, dead bodies laying there,\nand I figure I\u2019m gonna go between the dead bodies, in the middle there and I had a\nweak spot on my nose, which all \u2014 blood always comed \u2014 it came out. So what I\nOctober 22, 1997\ndid, whatever what I had, I hit my nose, and I fulled it out with blood, and my\nmouth was full of blood when the Nazis came around to try to drag the people out.\nSo first of all, the people who did not want to get up, they shot them on the pla \u2014\nthey killed them. So when they came to me and they saw that I still have a little life\nin it, so the other guy says, don\u2019t waste your bullets [indecipherable]. So they kept\non going. And then a little bit later, the Americans liberated, but they did not come\nin the camp. That was all on the outside. The thing were t \u2014 when I got up already,\nhow did I get out there? There was a lot of other people who were a little stronger,\nand they went around the camp and they start running, and they start saying, we are\nliberated, we are liberated, you could get up. Whoever lays down there who could\nget up, get up because we are liberate from the Americans. I never know just how\nthe system works in \u2014 in the army, because I never was in the army. The first thing\nwhen I got up, I went outside a little bit, I saw the American soldiers in there, and I\nwas told that\u2019s General Patton over there. I said, who\u2019s Patton? I never know this \u2014\nthose kind of names, because we never heard it. And then later on I find out all\nwhatever happened, how he came there and what he came there. And suddenly a\nfew soldiers came out, American soldier, and they start talking Yiddish me. They\nsay, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, who else is here? I said, they all Jew, all\naround me, they all Jewish people over here. Then he start talking, and the first\nOctober 22, 1997\nthing they tried [indecipherable] chocolate, chewing gum, they tried\n[indecipherable] the thing was interesting, the chewing gum, I took a lot of\npackages in, but they \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 til it was sweet. And when it wasn\u2019t more sweet, I\nswallow it. Then I got sick, because I didn\u2019t know. And then the guy \u2014 one guy\ncame over to me, another guy, he says to me in \u2014 in Yiddish, he says, you don\u2019t eat\nthat, he says, that\u2019s [indecipherable] only chew it on the mouth. I said, I never saw\nsomething like this in my life. And nobody said it, so there was other guys who got\nsick from it. I must \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many packages I ate up on the time. And\nthen we \u2014 we were \u2014 we get up a little bit and \u2014 and then more problems started in\nthe camp.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, which camp were you in when you were liberated, and when\nwas that?",
        "A: The camp I was liberated was Buchenwald. I was, I think in 63\u2122 block, 63 \u2014 30\n\u2014 something, I think that was the block, I was there. So \u2014",
        "Q: When was liberation for you?",
        "A: I\u2014it was in April some time, I think. I really don\u2019t have the date. I have it\nmarked down someplace, but in April sometimes, it was the liberation. Then it \u2014 it\narrived the problem was what happened after. We were all \u2014 of course, we didn\u2019t\neat for so long, and we were all hungry. And what was the bi \u2014 the biggest mistake,\nOctober 22, 1997\nwhat happen. They brought in all the food the SS ha-had accumulated for\nthemselves, and they brought it all in the camp, and we went there, you know, like \u2014\nlike \u2014 like hungry people, and we start eating and then the problem \u2014 nobody told us\ndon\u2019t eat because the stomach is smaller. And we all sick, so we start eating and\nmost of them died right in the sprot \u2014 in the spot in front of me. I got a flat typhus,\nand I was too \u2014 took right away to the hospital, and you know who treated me? A\nNazi doctor, where he still had the SS sign on him, and he treated me\n[indecipherable]. So they pumped the stomach and I had a headache after that for\nyears and years I couldn\u2019t get rid of that headache, that finally it went off \u2014 in\naccount of that flat typhus.",
        "Q: In addition to the typhus, did you have any other medical problems?",
        "A: Well, you know, you are so weak, and in general and you\u2019re really the merak \u2014\nyou are \u2014 you are sick all over, I mean, it\u2019s something which I could say, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\nmiracle thing which people survived after that, because we all were by all miracle,\nyou know, by all \u2014 how shall I say \u2014 medicine would not help us the way we were\nlooking. No \u2014 nothing would have help it, just miracle thing, and \u2014 and that\u2019s what\nhappened is the way we pulled through. Also, you pull through is the will \u2014 the will\n\u2014 the willpower to live, and that\u2019s the way it kept us going. We were a few people\ntogether there and we stick together til things got a little bit better. And then doctors\nOctober 22, 1997\ncame in. Al-All a prisoner of war doctor, all German \u2014 German doctors came 1n, in\nthe \u2014 although we went to the hospital there. We didn\u2019t leave the camp for awhile,\nbut later on we took [indecipherable] part of camps, and we went in in the German\nand the SS barracks, and there start to get a little bit better in general.",
        "Q: When you were taken to the hospital for treatment, you mentioned that you had\nan SS \u2014 a former SS doctor. Were there other doctors perhaps supervising, or \u2014 who\n\u2014 who was in charge of running the hospital at that point?",
        "A: That \u2014 that hospital actually was a hospital for the SS people. And due to the fact\nthere was a lot of prisoner of war who were Germans, they kept on running the\nsame hospital, the same thing 1-it was, except in \u2014 as \u2014 how shall I say? Instead\ntreating the Germans, they treated us. The hospital was overflowed and it kept on\n[indecipherable] more and more places and bringing more and more doctors to try\nto see \u2014 to cure us a little better. And all the medicine already the \u2014 the American\nprovided all this necessary thing for the people to survive. Also, like I was mention\nbefore, the willpower to live, we had a lot of encouragement from the American \u2014\nfor the soldier, from the Jewish soldiers, who told us \u2014 they were speaking, so\ninterested. I wa \u2014 I had a eastern European accent, you know, and when they were\ntalking, you know, I c \u2014 I couldn\u2019t understand. First I \u2014 I thought they \u2014 what kind\nof Yiddish they are talking to me? And then I got used to it and they told me, oh, I\nOctober 22, 1997\nwas born in America already and my grandparents came here, but it was interesting\nthey were still speaking the Yiddish language, which it had a lot to do with our\nsurvival, I think.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to be free, no longer be a prisoner of the Germans?",
        "A: We were told in the camps that it doesn\u2019t matter. If you live, they gonna kill you,\nand if you die, you die.",
        "Q: Who\u2019s the they?",
        "A: We were \u2014 we were talking between us in the camp. He says, there is no way\nout, because they not gonna let you live after \u2014 because we saw what happened\nalready to the \u2014 the people who were weak, they took them to work and then they\nkilled them. And we said between us, as long we could work, maybe they gonna\nkeep us alive. Once we cannot work, th-they not gonna let us go free, they gonna\nkill it. So actually to say \u2014 to find out in the end we are free, it just a \u2014 so many\nyears passed and I still can\u2019t believe it I\u2019m free, I\u2019m out of that thing. Because I still\ncould see that it happen like yesterday. It\u2019s not \u2014 so many years, so many \u2014 50\nyears. I think it happened yesterday. I could see everything in front of my eyes,\nwhat happened, right now, what \u2014 anything, any \u2014 any little details.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: Were you a witness to any acts of retribution or retaliation against the former\nprisoner \u2014 for \u2014 against the former guards or against collaborators, by the prisoners\nor by the allies who came and liberated you?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a ver \u2014 very interested. First of all, when we got liberated, who \u2014\nwho was a little strong, they caught some of the guards. What they did to those\nguards, even me, I had such a hatred against what they did to me, I couldn\u2019t stand it,\nI couldn\u2019t see. They pulled their finger out. They took pliers and they pulled their\nfinger out. The \u2014 they \u2014 they took a knife and they took their eyes out in front one of\nthe other one. And when one got tired, another guy took over. And \u2014 and what they\ndid to those people, I\u2019m sure they never [indecipherable]. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nwitness something like this, some \u2014 because one human being to do \u2014 to do to the\nother one, I \u2014 I \u2014 I said to the old guys around, I says the \u2014 I think the lord should\ntake on that, I saying we shouldn\u2019t take any retaliation something like this. Even\nwhat they did to us, you have to have a heart, you know, to do something like this. I\nalso heard that soon the camp was surrendered, Buchwald was surrendered, they\ncaught some guards and they put them to the wall \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I di \u2014 I think it \u2014 I\nwas told from the allied soldiers, I \u2014 I cannot \u2014 I\u2014 I can\u2019t poi \u2014 point a figure which\nallied soldier \u2014 and they shot about a hundred, 150 people. They put them to the\nwall \u2014 first they show them the brutality that they did, and then they killed them. I\nOctober 22, 1997\nthink you\u2019re better off to be killed than to \u2014 to do something like this, take eyes out,\npull finger out or something like that. I\u2014 I couldn\u2019t witness something like this, but\nthey \u2014 they kept on doing it. Most of them was the f \u2014 French soldiers, they were\nimprisoned, they brought them in prison, you know, they brought them to the camp,\njust a little bit before the liberation. They were really strong, and they did the job for\nthis thing.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were very weak, and \u2014 and you said you only weighed\n60 or 65 pounds. Can you describe what you looked like at the moment of\nliberation?",
        "A: Ihave a\u2014a-\u2014a picture here of one inmate, the way he looked after the liberation,\nbeyond medical \u2014 you know, beyond medical thing. If you would have given any\nkind of medicine, you could not survive. And well, you were young, you know\nwhat, 20 years, 19 years old, you know, the willpower was there. You try to take\ncare of yourself wherever you can, and \u2014 and now it-1t\u2019s something which you \u2014 you\nsurvived, which it \u2014 like I said, it\u2019s a miracle thing, whoever survived, whoever\ncame out alive from \u2014 from those camps.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you went to the hospital and you were cared for by the\ndoctors and they pumped your stomach. And you said you had a headache for \u2014 for\nOctober 22, 1997\nyears after that. Did you have any other health problems other than the headache\nafter your \u2014 your time 1n the hospital?",
        "A: Well, you know, even \u2014 even you went to hell like this, and when you are so\nyoung, you are in the teens you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something, you know, it doesn\u2019t a-\naffect that much, the thing which it happened by the older people, which they \u2014 they\ndied right on the spot. They \u2014 even the hospital, they died. Of course, in the later\nage, it comes out a little bit. I have other problems now, which you know, it\u2019s\nrelated to the camps, an-and even now during the night a lot of time, I see the SS in\n\u2014 marching by, and \u2014 and Ill wake up with a sweat. ll go to the window and I see,\noh, I\u2019m liberated. It\u2019s just an unbelievable thing, even now that I\u2019m liberated.",
        "Q: After you got out of the hospital, you said you went to the SS, the barracks, and\nyou were staying there for awhile. Tell me what were the living conditions like for\nyou and the other people you were with at that time?",
        "A: The living condition wasn\u2019t bad because the American provided everything.\nThey brought in everything. They brought it in with the truckl \u2014 truckloads. But I\nwas hoping that somebody will be there and tell us, don\u2019t touch this, don\u2019t touch\nthis, because our stomach couldn\u2019t take it and you just keep on throwing so much\nfood in there and \u2014 matter of fact, I \u2014 the first thing what I did, there was a box of \u2014\nof cookies, and I finished the whole box of cookies. I got sick from that too, and\nOctober 22, 1997\nthen one SS guy says to me, who \u2014 one SS doctor says to me, you understand any\nEnglish, American? I says no. The only one thing I heard the Americans saying,\nokay. That\u2019s the only on \u2014 word I could understand. He says, you know what you\nare eating? I says no. He says, you are eating dog biscuits, and that\u2019s why you are \u2014\ngot sick. I says, what about the \u2014 in the camps, the \u2014 the meat tasted so good. He\nsays, that was dog meat what you are eating, and that\u2019s what you got sick. They\nhave to put you back in the hospital for that da \u2014 so, matter of fact, I went in and out\nin the hospital for all kind of thing, any little thing. And \u2014 and then they had a big\ncelebration in the camp for liberation. And they had so much food in there, and got\nsick again. You know, you keep on eating and eating, you try to full yourself up and\n\u2014 and that was the wrong thing to do, but nobody said, and we were too naive to\nunderstand the whole thing, so \u2014",
        "Q: When you were liberated, were wi\u2014 you with any family or friends that you\nknew from before the war?",
        "A: I was \u2014 I had some people over there, some \u2014 just some friends, they were\ncoming from the same town, the area, but I didn\u2019t see them after this. The reason,\non the camp, and \u2014 in Buchenwald on the camp, and that s \u2014 it was some kind of a\nlibrary, at \u2014 but the SS library. On that library walls, they put down names \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow who put on the names, how they got the names, they put on names who\nOctober 22, 1997\nsurvive in other camps. So I looked around there and I saw my te \u2014 my sisters in \u2014\nin another camp not far from Suico(ph). Now how do you get to Suico(ph) from\nBuchenwald, the one place, the other one? Then I find out that\u2019s the bus is running\nfrom one town to the other one, I had another friend who finds somebody there, and\nI hop myself on the bus, but 1t wasn\u2019t easy, the bus \u2014 the bus was so fulled up\ninside, there was no room whatsoever. So we went on top of \u2014 on the bus, on the\nroof, and we laid down there. It was in \u2014 in July or August, it was \u2014 1t was really so\nchilly, the weather was so chilly, was so cold, and we didn\u2019t have the proper\nclothing, but we were in the \u2014 1n top of the bus almost all night, a day and a night\nsomething it took. What did we eat? There was some food around. Those people\nwho were in the \u2014 in the \u2014 they were mostly of the Germans \u2014 German people, not\nany others, so they had some food, and they shared some of us until we arrived in\nthe place and destination where we wanted to be. When we arrived in the place, I\nfind there \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of this town, but I know it was Suico(ph),\nou-outskirt of Suico(ph). It\u2019s Sachsen in Germany. So when we arrived over there,\nI went to look up, I went to the Biirgermeister and I wanted to find out if there is\nsuch a such people, where they are, because they were all registered. What they did\nthere, they \u2014 also the American made the people to take in the refugees in \u2014 in\ncivilian homes. So, due to the fact everybody was registered in town where they are,\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecause they had to provide food for them. So he told me yes, there is \u2014 over there\nand there, there is three Pasternaks. There was my oldest sister Rose, younger\nsister Raechel(ph), and there was another sister, Gitel. So I ask [indecipherable]\nthey said she died in the camp of \u2014 of-of typhus, something. So she died Hanukkah\ntime, so \u2014 and then we were all together 1n that time, and we were there for a little,\nshort time.",
        "Q: Tell me about your reunion with your sisters. What were the first things that you\nspoke about?",
        "A: When we got the reunion, the first thing was of \u2014 if \u2014 to find our father, because\nwe know he was strong guy, and we know he could survive. We didn\u2019t talk about\nour mother and another sister, because we know they went straight to the\ncrematorium because my mother was sick, and with the little sister. That\u2019s the first\nquestion, we tried to figure out a way. And then I had another brother, and I wanted\nto find him. His no \u2014 his name was Azreal(ph), so we wanted to find him, so we\ndidn\u2019t know where to start looking. And we were in that camp a little while, and I\nwanted \u2014 and \u2014 and it was \u2014 it \u2014 it really was some kind of a barracks too, after \u2014\nafter \u2014 when we went out from the civilian, we went in a little barrack because we\nwere ready to be \u2014 to go back into Germany. It\u2019s the reason it \u2014 because that time\nthe allies, they made some agreement with the Russians, that the Russians gonna\nOctober 22, 1997\ncome over to Suico(ph) and they gonna divide something [indecipherable] I heard\nsomething or \u2014 and \u2014 and that means, the next day, we will be in Russian zone, not\nin the American zone. It was very interest at that time, we didn\u2019t want to move from\nthere because we wanted really to go straight home to find out who else is alive, and\nwho else we could get reunited. So there was again, soldiers, American soldiers. I \u2014\nI don\u2019t know their rank, and they say okay, let\u2019s back up \u2014 in Yiddish, he say let\u2019s\nback up and \u2014 and go. We going \u2014 we going in to Germany, we going to\nFrankfurt. I say why? I have it so good over here, for now. I\u2019m gonna ma \u2014 we\ngonna make all the arrangement, and \u2014 and we gonna go back for my\n[indecipherable] which it was Transylvania, Mamurish(ph) and Oybarishu(ph),\nhe called it a different name [indecipherable] Yiddish they called it Visho(ph). So I\nwanted \u2014 so the \u2014 the \u2014 the f \u2014 captain, whatever he was, he had \u2014 he had some stars\non the time, was to be a captain. He says to me, you know, you people making a\nmistake. You just got liberated, and you gonna stay here. You know who\u2019s \u2014 who\u2019s\ngonna take you over? The Russians. I say look, when we were kids, they told us the\nlife in Russia is so good, he say, you only work and you get everything for nothing.\nSo, you would have no pro \u2014 I mean, we would have no problem, I says, nothing\u2019s\nwrong with \u2014 with them \u2014 to stay over there and to wait for them. He says, don\u2019t tell\nme \u2014 don\u2019t say it I didn\u2019t tell you, I didn\u2019t warn you. He say goodbye. The next day,\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe Russian came in and they \u2014 first of all, that ca \u2014 that barracks over there mus \u2014\nwas only women. | think me and my friend was the only man, well a \u2014 maybe \u2014 I\nwould say over a hundred girls [inaudible]. Soon that guy comes in and from us \u2014\nthere was people from Czechoslovakia, there \u2014 Jewish people from there, and they\nspeak the language, the Russian language. The first thing the Russian came in they\nsaid, if you people don\u2019t behave, we send you to Siberia. That guy who told \u2014\ntalked to us about the \u2014 th-this way, he had a couple of spoon in his boots, dirty all\naround. I couldn\u2019t figure out, I says to friends there, I says, that\u2019s the Russian?\nThat\u2019s what they told it to so good, and all the good thing it\u2019s in there? And he said,\nthat\u2019s the Russian. Now, we had to be very careful not to say anything because th-\nthey were drunk, right away they were drunk. I saw guys, they had two, three\nwatches in th \u2014 in their hand, taking them from other people. So we \u2014 now we were\n\u2014now we had a problem, tried to \u2014 we should get back to the American zone, but\nwe could not do it. So what we did, we made the arrangement, like I said before,\nand we went back to Romania. It wasn\u2019t such an easy trip to go back. First of all,\nwe had to get out from Germany, we went into Czechoslovakia, to Prague. We\nalso went with the train. And this was all Russian controlled zone. Those people\nacted like wild animals, like you see the wild kingdom of the animals. What di \u2014\nwhat did they do? First of all, I saw right away that I am dealing with the devil. So,\nOctober 22, 1997\nI removed \u2014 I was in \u2014 on one car, one boxcar, I was with some girls, with the girls,\nlike I was saying there was girls. So I says to my sister, first thing I gotta do, I gotta\nremove the locks. I took the locks off on both side, they should not be able to come\nin. They were banging all night to come in and to try and rob the people, rape the\npeople, whatever they did. The next day after the night, we \u2014 we got to a station, we\ngot some water there. It was in Czechoslovakia. What happened, I find out what\nthe Russian dids. They were acting unhuman to those girl, the skeletons girl, they\nwere acting. They \u2014 even they had something like a watch or something, they took\neverything from them away. They were riding also on top of the \u2014 on that \u2014 on the\ntrain, and the bridges were low over there, most of them got killed on the spot there,\nbecause they were \u2014 they were drunk and standing up there, and they falled off. So\nfrom there, after I saw right away the situation again, so the girls come over to me,\nthey say, you saved our lives. I was there with my other friend in there, he says you\nsaved our lives because you \u2014 smart thing to do is to remove the locks, they\nshouldn\u2019t be able to come in. And then we arrived in \u2014 in Prague, we were there a\nfew days, it to \u2014 it took quite awhile to get for the train there to Prague. And in\nPrague we were a few days. There was already, I think the Jewish organizations;\nthe first time I saw Jewish organizations try to talk us and try to help us go further.",
        "Q: Which organizations?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: The \u2014 the Joint. That time was the Joint. So they were a \u2014 also I saw \u2014 I was very\nsurprise to see also people of the Jewish organizations from South Africa. Of\ncourse, I learned about South Africa [indecipherable]. There was a woman\nsoldiers, Jewish girls, women soldiers, speaking Yiddish 1n such a funny accent, I\nnever \u2014 never heard something \u2014 I couldn\u2019t figure out \u2014 even I understand, which I\n\u2014I didn\u2019t speak any English, I couldn\u2019t understand the way they were talking. But\nm \u2014 the products \u2014 1-1t\u2019s too \u2014 it was the Joint, but most of the [indecipherable] it \u2014\nit was written on the can, I\u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m a tuna, you know, a gift from the South African\nJews, Johannesburg. I could see the label in \u2014 in front of my eye, there was\nwritten. And they made us very comfortable over there and they tried to get us\nfurther dow \u2014 further to \u2014 to get to our desin \u2014 destination. So from Prague we took\nanother train, of course. Some people \u2014 not with the same people, some people, they\nwent on different direction. We went into Budapest. We sto \u2014 in Budapest I had\nvery little problem, because Czech, I didn\u2019t speak that language, but in Hungary I\nspeak the language, so we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we had very little problem. Also there was\nalso the Jewish organization like the Joint. I didn\u2019t see the South Africans there,\nthere was only the Joint, the American. And they took over a place, they call it\nAdjibat(ph) school. There was a school there and the name was Adjibat(ph) and\nthey \u2014 there was a lot of food already, kitchens over there, setting up. But you\nOctober 22, 1997\ncouldn\u2019t go out on the street because they were looking for Nazis, the \u2014 the\nRussians were looking for Nazis so they had the Hungarians with the \u2014 going\naround with them. And the \u2014 and they know right away, there\u2019s not the \u2014 don\u2019t look\nHungarian because the way you walk, the way you eat, the way the thing, right\naway they point it out from you. So the Russians gave in the documents that we are\nre-refugees in Budapest. We also got documents in Prague, which I have them\nright here. And the reason I| kept all those documents from wherever I went, they\ngave us a paper and I kept it. I also got the papers from the liberation from\nBuchenwald from the U.S. Army, which I have it here in my possession. For all\nthose year, I carried that. So in Budapest, I went out in the street, I felt like home,\nyou know, we went out, we took a walk. I find one guy which e \u2014 he was our\nneighbor, and he was in the Czech army that time. And we walked, we kept on\ntalking, we walk in the street there and finally we saw one guy \u2014 two \u2014 two people,\nnot one, but one guy we recognized. I said, is it the chief of the police of our town?\nYou know what this guy did with him in my \u2014 thi \u2014 this person who I \u2014 I know from\nhome? He \u2014 first he beat the hell out of him, and the Russians came around, there\nwa a lot of soldiers, they came around and they seen what\u2019s going on, they didn\u2019t\nintervene at all, til the guy got ready, and then he s \u2014 he says to the Russian, he said,\nthis is the guy, when we were in the ghetto in the \u2014 and boxcars used to come in\nOctober 22, 1997\nwith potatoes or other kind of food for the ghetto, so this guy took away all the\nfood, he gave it to the local people and to us, when it \u2014 in the bottom on the train\nthere was dirt, he said, this is for the Jew. And then this fellow, the Jewish guy, he\npicked up the \u2014 the Czech soldier and he pu \u2014 picked up a lot of dirt from the floor\nand he fulled up his mouth, he says, this is the dirt what you told us to eat, now you\neat the dirt. And after a few days, we decided we are going to see whoever\u2019s alive.\nIt\u2019s about five an \u2014 500 kilometer from Budapest to our destination. When we got \u2014\nit was easy to get, you know, the \u2014 the traveling that I \u2014 the trains used to go maybe\n20 miles an hour, the whole train, even the \u2014 it was written 1n the car they go 40\nmile, they only go about 20 mile. Sometime you could run faster than the trains, the\nway they had those trains. And we got home to our destin \u2014 destination, the\nOybarishu(ph) Mamurish(ph). We came home, and of course the \u2014 it was a very\ninteresting place. First of all, on the da \u2014 this place, before th-they call it Rishu(ph),\nit was Austria-Hungary before the first World War. On the fir \u2014 on the W-World\nWar first after, they \u2014 the Romanian took it over. In 1940, the Hungarians took it\nover. So we were shoved to one \u2014 from one to the other one. When the Hungarians\nwent \u2014 when it was Austro-Hungary, that wasn\u2019t a bad place to live, and to \u2014 it\nwas pretty good over there, because there was a lot of wood, and the Hungarians,\nthe Austrian didn\u2019t have so much wood, the tree, so it was not a bad life. But when\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe Romanian came in, and the Romanian had a lot of wood, so life got deteriorated,\nit was \u2014 it was such a good, I mean, people were suffering a lot. And when we\narrived in the \u2014 on the \u2014 1n the town and the city, manufactured was\n[indecipherable] city with \u2014 of three \u2014 4,000 Jews in there before the war. When\nwe arrived there, we find a couple of Jewish families in there and we tried to see\nhow we could do something, and tried to build up our lives \u2014 put together the life.\nBut we really couldn\u2019t make it out. We try all kinds of business, we\u2019re trying to\nbring in store from one \u2014 from one place to the other one, tra \u2014 traveling to the\ntowns, things like this, and the bottom line, we couldn\u2019t make out.",
        "Q: When you came back to your town, how were you received by your \u2014 your\nneighbors, the non-Jewish community?",
        "A: We - we really \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too bad even before we le \u2014 we got along with the\nRomanians pretty good. It was a city from Romanians, Hungarians, Germans. We\nhad our own, you know, like neighborhoods. This was a German neighborhood,\nthere was Hungarian. But really 1-1t wasn\u2019t that bad before the war with those\npeople, we got along pretty good. But th-the \u2014 the thing is, with the Germans it was\nanother \u2014 another ball game that time because they \u2014 they went \u2014 they called it\n[indecipherable] they all went to the German army, they all went to the SS army.\nAnd of course, that was not, you know, good cooperation with them. So when I was\nOctober 22, 1997\n\u2014 we \u2014 when we were in Viseu, so our first thing, we find our brother in there. He\nwas in the Hungarian army as a laborist. And we find him over there already, but\nwe couldn\u2019t make ends meet over there. So I was there with my \u2014 my brother\nAzreal(ph), and I was there with my sister Rose and Raechel(ph) and Gitel. But the\nmost interested thing, my sister was married before the war, and my brother-in-law\ncame back and they got reunited again in Viseu in the same town. So \u2014 but there\nwas no more futures because I saw a different type of life after, whenever you travel\none city to the other one, and the life in \u2014 in the town was so backwards. So there\nwas really nothing more we could do. So we made preparation. We tried to sell\nthing, but to who you gonna sell? Because when we came home, most of the houses\nwas robbed. They took everything away, the local people. Even we got along with\nthem nice, but they still, you know, they still tried to get something for nothing and\nthey came down \u2014 they used to live out of town, they came down in the town, they\noccupied all the Jewish houses in there, and it was no life whatsoever. So our mind\nwas just to get out of there, and to see what we could start up new.",
        "Q: You mentioned several reunions; your reunion with your sisters, and then\nmeeting your brother and then your sister finding her husband. When you became\nreunited, did you sit down with these family members and exchange experiences?\nTell them what happened to you and hear their story?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: We - we ex \u2014 first of all, we were talking about the \u2014 our father to see if we\ncould find him to find out what it is. And that was in the top of the agenda, to find\nout if he\u2019s alive, because we know he \u2014 he could survive because he was strong\nfellow and so the thing is this, we find some other people who came in in town, and\nthey told us we should not expect the father, because he had \u2014 he was in\nTheresienstadt for specialty reason and they bombed the camp, and he was\nworking there as a veteran doctor with a friend of his, and he didn\u2019t go to work that\nday, he was taking care of the German horses, and the allies bombed the camp, and\ndestroyed the camp, and they killed them, the f-f\u2014 the first day of Chol HaMoed\nPesach, and that\u2019s when we keep the Yahrzeit because we know exactly when he\ngot killed.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to pause, and I\u2019m going to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Bernard Pasternak. This is tape one, side B, and I had asked you about the\nkinds of things that you and your siblings talked about when you became reunited.\nAnd you had told me that you had news of your father in Theresienstadt.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, there \u2014 some more people came in 1n our town, and the city, they came\nhome and we tried to find out if the \u2014 1f \u2014 1f maybe they could find out where my\nfather was. We didn\u2019t know he was in Theresienstadt, we had \u2014 couldn\u2019t find out\nwhat camp. Then there was a barber, he was a avrum(ph) de barbera(ph) they\ncalled in town. He was a very good friend my father, and then he told us the tragedy\nwhat happened. My father knows horses, and he had a friend, he was working in a\ndrugstore, and due to the fact there was a very good combination, and the Germans\ngive him the job taking care of their horses. And then the next day or so, that time it\nwas very big bombardment, they wiped out the camp, right, and my father and his\nfriend Drogas(ph), th-they both got killed. And it was the first day of Chol\nHaMoed Pesach, and that\u2019s the day we are keeping the Yahrzeit, because we\nknow exactly what the day and \u2014 and the Yahrzeit for my mother, my sister, we\nkeep the first day of when we arrived in Auschwitz, that was [indecipherable].\nAnd we \u2014 it\u2019s actually picked a day, because we don\u2019t know exactly when they went\nto the crematorium, but according to the rabbi, they told us that when you arrived,\nthat\u2019s the day that you gotta keep the Yahrzeit. But therein \u2014 then, after we find out\nabout our father, so there were no more hope in there, and no more thing, so try to\ngo back from where we came, to Germany, to the American zone, we know we\nhave family in the United States and other family in other areas. So we tried to go\nOctober 22, 1997\nback because we already heard that they have there DP camps they opened in\nAustria and Germany and other places. So we go in in that camp and from there\nprobably we\u2019ll be able to go into our \u2014 another country because we have nothing to\ndo any more in here, it\u2019s all washed out. Now, going back wasn\u2019t so easy, it was\nvery hard to go back. First of all, we had to have money to travel, you couldn\u2019t do\nit. We had a few things, but we hardly got anything for it. So we start traveling, we\nwent back to one city, they call it [indecipherable]. We went over there with the\ntrain. From there we had to go in on the \u2014 to the Czechoslovakia side again, in the\nAllneek(ph) Javorkt(ph) mountains. We went \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t catch us, the\nRussian, because if they catch you, they were controlled with Russian,\n[indecipherable] Russian they get you, then like they said, they take you to\nSiberia(ph). So we went to Czechoslovakia. From there we had to cut into\nHungary, also during the day \u2014 it was summer \u2014 during the day we were sitting on\nthe high grasses, lay down over there, because there was a lot of Russian patrols,\nand a lot of them got caught. And then we went, little by little, til we arrived to\nHungary. We went over to Hungary, back to Hungary, and when we arrived\nthere, also we \u2014 they caught us, because a lot of people, they were talking, and\nyou\u2019re not supposed to talk. And they \u2014 that time was the corn harvest, we were\nsitting in there, and at night we start running again. We \u2014 we went one place, we\nOctober 22, 1997\nhad a few dollars that time, we sold something. And there was a guy who used to\ntake over from \u2014 who took over the water there with the boats, something\n[indecipherable] from one place to the other one, so we gave him a few dollar, he\ntook us over in the other side, on the Hungarian side. And then we took a train over\nthere. The train which \u2014 the train will go to Budapest. Now also that train was so\nfull of people, local people, there was no place what to put nothing. We also find\nout that Hungary has no salt. There\u2019s no salt over there. So we took a few bags of\nsalt, and we \u2014 to take it back to Hungary, because that was a big commodity over\nthere. Oh, actually, the salt we had for nothing, because Romanian had so much\nsalt, which it was no problem. When we took the train, we also had to go on the\nslate roof. We had to go on the slate roof and lay down there, you know, to keep on\ngoing, which it took a few days from one area til we are \u2014 til we got to Budapest.\nNow who was there? It was there was my brother Areal(ph) and again my older\nsister with her husband, they remained behind. They \u2014 they decided they not ready\nto go back yet. So it was my other two sister, my brother and myself. So we stood\non that slate roof over there, also the bridge, 1t was so low you had to keep your\nhead down. And a lot of time, you know, the way those trains were going, it\u2019s not\nlike a train, you know, it was shaking you back and forth and throwing you around.\nThen finally we arrived in a\u2014 in Budapest. And from there, there \u2014 there was\nOctober 22, 1997\nalready \u2014 the Joint was there, and put us up there temporary places. We also had to\ngive for the Hungarian newspaper, we had to give interviews to them what\nhappened. And we stood there about a week or so, and then \u2014 the be \u2014 the Bricha,\nthe Jewish orga \u2014 the Jewish Bricha from \u2014 from that time of Palestine. So what\nthe Jewish Bricha from Palestine, working already to try to help people from\ndestination, one the other one. So the bi \u2014 Bricha brought us over to our destination\nclose to the Austrian border. I forgot to tell the name of the \u2014 of the city over there.\nAnd from there, the Bricha, they wanted we \u2014 we should go \u2014 we should go further.\nTh-The destination supposed to be Pa-Palestine that time. So, when we arrived in\nSaulfil(ph), Soulfil(ph) \u2014 something \u2014 so when we arrived over there in that place,\nof course we had to cross over to Austria. Now, how do you cross to Austria,\nbecause it was all Russians, all around. And then what the border was, it\u2019s so tight, I\nmean with soldier, that he couldn\u2019t go through at all over there, even through the\nfields, and more than it was in Hungary and Romania and Czechoslovakia. So w-\nwe sold a few things, a few \u2014 first of all, we sold the salt that we already had, about\n50 dollar that time for the salt, 1t was such a commodity. Must have schlepped\nmaybe 200 kilo of salt, between all of us. We had about 50 dollar already. Well, we\narrived over there in this place, so they told us, the only way you could go past\nthere, if you have to go, they have to take you over the border. We find out there is\nOctober 22, 1997\na guy, a Russian guy, a driver, he had a truck there, his name was Sashka(ph). We\ntalked to him \u2014 I mean, I didn\u2019t talk, because I didn\u2019t speak Russian. So there was\npeople who talked to him, and finally he agreed I think five dollars for each of us.\nWe wanted to give him shillings, Hungarian money, but we \u2014 because that was easy\nto get. He says no, he says, nyeda(ph) shilling, nyeda(ph) \u2014 dollare(ph),\ndollare(ph). So finally we give him five dollar each, still had a few dollar left, and\nhe fulled up the truck, a open truck. He says, all \u2014 everybody lay down in the truck.\nWe come to the border and the Austrians, they try to stop us with some soldier\nguard. You know what the guy did? He went right over them. He kept on going like\n\u2014 like nothing, he didn\u2019t care who stopped him or what, because there was \u2014 to him\nwas no border. And \u2014 and he took us in to \u2014 we passed Wiener Neustadt, and we\narrived in \u2014 in \u2014 in Vienna. In Vienna. We atrived in Vienna, that was the\ndestination.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: The time \u2014 the time from one to the other only took weeks, weeks, to get to this\ndestination. I would say it was summer, and really it could be in September\nsometime, August, September, because we didn\u2019t stay too long, we got liberated\nMay, and August, September, maybe October, we arrived in th \u2014 1n there. From\nthere \u2014 when we arrived to Vienna, we already had some helping, people helped us\nOctober 22, 1997\nand they told it, there 1s the Rothschild hospital, which they used that hospital Who\nare they? They \u2014 the \u2014 the Bricha from \u2014 from Palestine, they used that hospital. Of\ncourse, who paid? The Joint paid. The American Jew paid for that. So we used the\nhospital for all the refugees who got together. Now, Vienna you couldn\u2019t get out\njust like this, because Vienna \u2014 Vienna had the four zone over there. And we were\non the American zone. Now how you gonna get \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even go from one\nzone to the other one. Now how you gonna go 1n, and all \u2014 everybody wanted to go\nto the American zone because that was the right place to go 1f you wanted to\nemigrate, or even they had the French zone, the English zone, they didn\u2019t count\nmunch \u2014 much in that, they didn\u2019t care too much about the other zone. So it was\nvery interested when you are in the \u2014 in the hospital, in the Rothschild hospital,\nthey \u2014 the Joint, with the Bricha together, they \u2014 their leaders, they rented a truck, a\nbig truck and they made it special for \u2014 for \u2014 for people to be able to sit down in the\n\u20141n the side of the truck. And we should go from Vienna, we should go to Linz.\nLinz is in Austria. Of course Linz was already the American zone. There was a\nbridge over there, and that divided between the Russian and the American zone.\nWhen we got to \u2014 when we got f\u2014 we \u2014 we got on the way, you know, we \u2014 so what\nhappened in the mountain, the truck had an accident, banged with another truck. I\nhit so bad my arm there, and ripped off the r \u2014 the roof, everything, and we couldn\u2019t\nOctober 22, 1997\ngo further. So then we have to take a train. So we come with the train, they fulled\nup the train with so many people from the camps, ma \u2014 from other camps together\n[indecipherable] of three, because everybody want to run away. And we got with\nthe train, we got by the border by Linz, the Russians. We were told \u2014 they ask you\nwho you are \u2014 first of all, you don\u2019t speak no Russian, a word, even the people who\nspeak Russians, they shouldn\u2019t say a word in Russian. So they told us we should say\nwe are Greeks. We were displaced, thr-thrown out from Greece, and now we like to\ngo back. The train stopped there by the \u2014 by the bridge there, where it\u2019s supposed to\ngo over to the American zone, on the Russian zone, the train stopped there, and the\nRusskis came around. They were a little bit better dressed already, they didn\u2019t have\nthat knife and fork and \u2014 and sticked in in their boots. They were a little cleaner,\nthey come around this, and to every car they say, [speaks Russian] that \u2014 that much\nI learned. And nobody \u2014 everybody looked in them, and we kept on saying \u2014 a guy\ncame over to me, he says to me [Russian]? No, Greco, Greco, Greco. So he kept\non going, because that\u2019s what they told. But in that train with me, there was a lot of\nRussian \u2014 I know what they were looking, they were looking for deserters, mostly\ndeserters. There was a russ \u2014 a lot of Russian Jewish soldier, they deserted and they\nwent to Palestine. I would say most of the credit for the liberation, 1948, comes to\nthose Russian soldier, they were already trained, and they really know how to fight,\nOctober 22, 1997\nthose people, that\u2019s why \u2014 I was talking with them after. So finally they \u2014 we went\nto that bridge and we went into Linz already in the American zone. It was the \u2014 it\nwas something to us like in the liberation from the Nazis, because we really\nliberated now. We stood in Linz, they had camps there made up for displace\npersons. So I was talk with my sisters, my brother, I says to the \u2014 I says, you know,\nthis is too close to the Russian. I \u2014 I \u2014 we hated them so much what they did to us. I\nsaid, let\u2019s go further and far away from them, far away. So we went into Salzburg \u2014\nSalzburg, and they also had camp set up, a displaced person camp.",
        "Q: In the DP camp in Salzburg, who or which agencies provided assistance for\nyou?",
        "A: That time the \u2014 the Joint was providing with a lot of stuff, but that time was the\nUNRRA. The \u2014 the organization which they \u2014 they \u2014 they did a terrific job, no\nquestion about it. Later on, it took over from the UNRRA, took over the IRO,\nInternational Refugee Organization. So they took over, but we were much better off\nin the UNRRA when we arrived in \u2014 in Salzburg. I had some mechanical and\nelectrician background. On the first thing I became the chief of [indecipherable]\nand I have here a statement from the lager camp, and it\u2019s written in Yiddish, and\nI\u2019m gonna read it for you Yiddish. It says [reads in Yiddish] So what it says in\nEnglish, that I was in \u2014 in \u2014in DP camp there, I became the chief electrician on the\nOctober 22, 1997\n\u2014on the camp, and there was a lot of people, thousands of people, and they all\ncounted to me and I did the best I can to make everybody comfortable, and \u2014 and\nthen that\u2019s why they give me this \u2014 this thing.",
        "Q: Can you translate that for me?",
        "A: In the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the English way, right? Okay. That\u2019s where we were \u2014 we are\na\u2014 we are telling that Pasternak [indecipherable], he \u2014 he \u2014 he was born in 1927,\nand he lived in the \u2014 in Salzburg, the camp in Salzburg they called Machne\nYehuda, estra(ph). He was the electrician in la \u2014 in the camp, and he did a lot of\ninstallation work, he made a lot of people very comfortable. People start to come\nthat time, the people who got liberated from Russia \u2014 there wasn\u2019t only\nconcentration \u2014 people from the concentration camp, there was already people they\ncame from Russia. And I \u2014 I tried to do the best and \u2014 and of course there was no\npay whatsoever for this, you did it just for the \u2014 for the sake of the people. And\nthat\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a signed by the [indecipherable] and it\u2019s signed by the \u2014 by\nthe whole \u2014 by the whole people in there who was in charge of that camp. But when\nI was in camp there, I did not really \u2014 I was not such a great electrician to be able to\nget a job any other place, you know. There, you put a wire right to left, and so you\ncan be an \u2014 you could get by. But I was very interested in the \u2014 in that kind of job\nfor my future, so I\u2014I went and I registered myself in \u2014 in I\u20141n the ORT school.\nOctober 22, 1997\nThey had a ORT school, and I \u2014 I learned there \u2014 I went there electrician school,\nbut I had a problem, yeah, I had a problem at the ORT school. One of the problem\n\u2014 most of them were speaking Polish, were mostly fr \u2014 they came from Russia. |\ndidn\u2019t speak a word Polish, a few words, so I had a problem, but the problem got\nsolved a little bit, I start picking up the Polish language, so it got a little bit better. I\nhad certificate right in front of my eyes with a picture from the ORT in Salzburg. It\nsays [indecipherable] student of electric, electrician in Salzburg, and this was\ngiven out to me in 1948. I also have one \u2014 another one that\u2019s \u2014 th-that\n[indecipherable] from the [RO \u2014 well, from the ORT, was in \u2014 in Haline(ph). It\nsays, Assembly Center Haline(ph), International Refugee Organization area, team\none, Salzburg, Austria, Haline(ph) 12 April 1949, that\u2019s when they give that out.\nAnd this is the certifica \u2014 the certif \u2014 certify that Pasternak Beru \u2014 I didn\u2019t even\nknow I used to call Bernard Beru, now I didn\u2019t even know this, they call me that\nBeru, b-e-r-u, born in 15/8/1927, in Oybarishu, Romania has been registered in\nCamp Reidenburg since August 1946 til August 1948. So you had to have all this\nthing if you wanted to emigrate to another country, you had to be registered 1n all\nthose places. So \u2014",
        "Q: In addition to the people who were speaking Polish, so you picked up some\nPolish language, who else was in the DP camp with you?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Mostly Jewish. Mostly \u2014 mostly \u2014 most of them Jewish people. That camp was\nin Salzburg, in Reidenburg what they called the camp, that was mostly all Jewish\npeople. It was, like I said, there was people from concentration camp, there was\npeople who arrive from Russia, and destination was Israel, because we supposed to\nget that \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the country is supposed to be born that time. Before \u2014\nbefore even the country was born, I had a little bit, you know, like something, a\nrevenge type \u2014 I felt myself I need some kind of revenge to see what they did to the\nJewish people, to the families, things like that. And the only thing what I could do\nto go in and to \u2014 to go to the Irgun, they had classes 1n \u2014 in the camp they had\nclasses for the Irgun. So I became a Irgunist. I did a few things, you know, right or\nwrong, whatever it was, so to take some kind of revenge, to see \u2014 and I learned to\nshoot very good, and I became to \u2014 to be a very good soldier in there. It took\nmonths and months. Of course, it was hidden, 1t was underground whole \u2014 the\nwhole thing. There was some already Israelis [indecipherable]. Matter of fact, most\nof them were Israelis who trained us how to shoot. And I never had a gun in my\nhand or thing like this. So they had, in Salzburg, they had big parks in there, in \u2014\nlike amusement parks. I went in the park one time with my friends, and you know,\nthey had this \u2014 to shoot the ducks or the other thing, and I aimed perfect and\neverything, whatever I want to shoot, so I became \u2014 matter of fact, they even said, 1-\nOctober 22, 1997\nif you go \u2014 when I go to Israel, is gonna be, I\u2019m gonna be the first sergeant without\nany st-st \u2014 star from the stripe, not from the beginning. They put me on for sergeant\nright away, the way I was leading, and the way I was operating and \u2014 and the way I\nwas learning the whole thing. I wanted to go to Israel so bad because before the\nwar, and I was a kid, I also belonged to organization Betar. I wanted to go to Israel\nthat time, but I could not go at that time because the parents were ver \u2014 very against,\nand also the rabbis were very against, and even that time, of which the Romanians\ndidn\u2019t care too much about the organization, we had to be underground 1n account\nof the Jew, our own Jewish people, because they said to me, if you step out of this\ncity from here, you\u2019re gonna became a non-Jew. So I says, well, there 1s \u2014 my aunt\nis in the United States and she\u2019s Jewish, and maybe I could go there. No, you\ncannot go no place, otherwise you\u2019re not gonna be a Jew, you\u2019re gonna throw away\nyour heritage, your Jewish heritage. And they \u2014 matter of fact, really I wanted to go\nto Israel because my \u2014 my \u2014 I \u2014 the Zionists were so much \u2014 even now, my Zionist\nwas so much in me, I wanted to go just to Israel. I didn\u2019t care, I wanted to be\n[indecipherable] just to go, and I was young, 17 - 18 year. I could not go because\nthose rabbi didn\u2019t let me. And I tell you the truth, I have a hatred for that, because\nthey hold us back, all the kids. Most of the kids they even \u2014 they even got killed in\nthe concentration camp. So when I was already ready to go to Israel, which I\nOctober 22, 1997\nmentioned, I had an aunt, she lived in the Bronx, and \u2014 156 Honeywell Avenue,\nand was [indecipherable] Boulevard, so Southern Boulevard. So I went and we\ndidn\u2019t know her address, but my older sister Rose, she remembered she used to\nwrite to \u2014 my mother used to write to her sister. She remembered the address by\nheart. So we wrote her, and she said, dear, we are so happy you are alive, and things\nlike this. She said, don\u2019t try to go any other place, come to the United States first. I\nhave \u2014 matter of fact, I have papers here in front of me. When my aunt send us all\npaper, you know, the affidavits with working, with all the guarantee. She says, first\ncome here and then you gonna go to Israel, Israel just created right now, it\u2019s gonna\nbe a little hardship. I says, I don\u2019t care the hardship, that\u2019s what I want to do. And\nfinally I couldn\u2019t leave my sister, we \u2014 we have such a few left, so finally we\ndecided we come to United States.",
        "Q: Who in your family was with you in the DP camp?",
        "A: We were al \u2014 my sisters, all sister, my brother, we were all in the prekee ca \u2014\nDP camp in Salzburg, except my older sister with her husband, they remain behind.",
        "Q: Can you be a little bit more specific about the kind of \u2014 of activities you engaged\nin when you were training for the Irgun? You said there was some retaliation. Can\nyou please just clarify a little bit?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Yes, well, we had the Austrians there and \u2014 and in the Reidenburg camp, there\nwas a fire brigade in there. I went out with my friend and we blew up a truck over\nthere, we put something in there, we blew up the truck. There was no human life\nlost. And it was another time we went to \u2014 to a bridge there, we know that a lot of\nGermans are passing over there, we blew up the bridge over there, so we really got\na little revenge in a different way. But I still wanted to go to Israel with that time,\nlike with the training thing I had and I was very, very famous [indecipherable]\nguys there. But I feel very bad my aunt took th \u2014 talked us into come to this country,\nwhich \u2014 and then, you know, once you came 1n this country, so you don\u2019t go away\nso easy, so \u2014 I cha \u2014 also want to mention, my brother, Azreal(ph), he had so much\ncourage, which I, tell you the truth, I wouldn\u2019t do it. What did he do? He went back\nto Romania in the town, he got my sister and my brother-in-law and brought them\nback to Austria. We alre \u2014 I already had some money in there in the camp because I\nwas doing some work sa \u2014 for the Austrians, I was doing some work outside the\ncamp. They needed electricians, so I went, my friends and we did some work. The\nAustrians, the work what we did, it was not really for the Austrians, it was for the\nAmerican soldiers, they were living in Austria in the houses, in the apartment, and\nthey needed some lights and all those thing, and we used to put them on, I used to\nget the stove, you know, all the merchandise, whatever I need. And I used to do\nOctober 22, 1997\nsome work from them, so I already had some money. And we give this whole\nwhatever we had to my brother, and he start the journey back and he got them back\nsafe to Austria, I mean, to Salzburg, I says \u2014 I don\u2019t know whoever could do\nsomething like this, but he had the guts and he did it. So til \u2014 we all got together, we\nall were, the whole family got together in Austria.",
        "Q: When you were in the DP camp, what kinds of things did the survivors talk\nabout, other than perhaps the \u2014 the training that you were having, and \u2014 and your \u2014\nyour ideas about going to Israel, what else did you talk about?",
        "A: Well, it f\u2014 we f-\u2014 first of all, we talked about families, what happened. And\nwhen we went in in \u2014 in the concentration camp, we didn\u2019t know what happened,\nwe didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, anyhow, til we were in there. So everybody used\nto tell the story, I was there, I was there, and one guy says, oh I was there too. I\nsays, I was in the same block and I couldn\u2019t rec \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know he was there.\nAnd the main [indecipherable] the whole thing you want to know 1s all just Israel,\njust Israel, to get the land of Israel, to get to our own place. Also, at the first time,\nand it was a holiday, it was Passover at that time, and there was the Austrian station,\nthe [indecipherable] radio station, and the first time we heard Yiddish speaking on\nthe Austrian radio station to wish us happy, healthy holiday. And it was one of the\nOctober 22, 1997\ngreatest things to \u2014 to hear a Jewish voice f-from, you know especially in \u2014 in\nAustrian, Na-Nazi land, and \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: When you were in the DP camp, were there any demonstrations for the partition\nof Palestine and \u2014 and the state of Israel\u2019?",
        "A: No. I\u2014I don\u2019t think there was any demonstration, because he ha \u2014 you didn\u2019t\nhave [indecipherable] to demonstrate whatsoe \u2014 we did have different type of\ndemonstration. We had demonstration, there used to be a lot of guys, they used to\ngo out on Salzburg, they used to beat up guys, German guys, Austrian guy, they\nused to beat them up. They used to be caught by the police, and the police arrested\nthem, and we couldn\u2019t see this \u2014 a German sol \u2014 German people to hold our own\npeople, so we start to demonstrating, we didn\u2019t want to eat that time, you know, we\ntook the food out the middle of the camp, and we took the \u2014 there was a kitchen\nthere, I mean, there was a lot of food, and \u2014 and we spilled the food on the street\nover there, and we showed the camp commander \u2014 he was an American \u2014 that we\nnot gonna tolerate something like this. So they finally have the agreement that we\ngonna hold them in our own jails to find out what \u2014 so we brought them back to the\ncamp and matter of fact, the guy\u2019s name was Kulnik(ph), so he brought him back in\nthe camp, and \u2014 til the trial came and they had trial about it and they find him not\nguilty. But they also give him the punishment \u2014 the judge in there give him the first\nOctober 22, 1997\npunishment, he said, you have to leave the country right away. And there was no \u2014\nyou know, there was no com \u2014 transportation to go anyplace, so there was special\ntransportation for some of those guys, they took them straight to Palestine. Final \u2014\nfinal \u2014 probably they wind up in \u2014 in Cyprus that time. But that was the\npunishment. So \u2014",
        "Q: When you did your retribution activities, the blowing up of the truck, whatever,\ndid you make it known that it was a \u2014 a Jewish activity in retribution for what\nhappened during the war?",
        "A: Yes, because we put \u2014 we left our \u2014 our \u2014 our \u2014 w-we put a [indecipherable].\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna be, so they know right away that it comes from us. But\nnobody would expect me whatsoever, I was such a quiet guy in camp, fixing\neverything in there. And then we went out, had a few guys, they really were tough.\nLike, I was mentioning these Ru-Russian soldiers \u2014 the Jewish soldiers, and they\nwere really trained, they were really some [indecipherable] what they say, they\nreally did. And they did some contribution to the \u2014 to Palestine that time. They\nwere good.",
        "Q: You said that you left like a calling card. What was it? Rock, kach?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: [indecipherable] that\u2019s what it\u2019s ga \u2014 that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gonna be. The way you\nsay \u2014 way they say never again, this was [indecipherable] you know something,\nthat\u2019s the way it\u2019s gotta be. And \u2014",
        "Q: Only like this.",
        "A: And only like this and they know right away that \u2014 matter of fact, they gave us a\nname, the German; [indecipherable] was here. They \u2014 the way they p \u2014 they\npronounced it. So \u2014 actually we \u2014 we \u2014 we just took our little revenge and \u2014 and \u2014 to\nshow them that we are not sleeping people, we are not people you could shove us\naround, and we could do something too. Thing like that. And they \u2014 the \u2014 the\nGermans, they \u2014 I would say they start respecting us in general. We also did \u2014 we\nalso traveled to Germany itself, to Minchen(ph) where there was a \u2014 so many\nJewish people in there, so we had co-contact, along with the other one, and we got\ncaught by the border too, by the American soldiers, we got caught, because it\u2019s still\na country, going to the other one. And we got caught by the border, he\u2019s \u2014 we \u2014 we\nsupposed to go that time to \u2014 to Minchen(ph) from Salzburg. So when we got by\nthe border, so two MPs come over, they say halt. Stay there, he says. Where are you\ngoing? I say, we gonna go to Salzburg. It\u2019s not true, because we came from\nSalzburg. He said, you can\u2019t go, you have to go to Minchen(ph). And that\u2019s the\nway we went right through. So, we had to laugh in our own way, you know. But we\nOctober 22, 1997\ndid got caught a few more times and \u2014 and \u2014 in that \u2014 in that thing, by the border\nthing. It was guarded by the allies, you know, and couldn\u2019t fool around too much,\nso \u2014 but we were young, you know, and full of hate, hate from the \u2014 what they did\nto us, you know, and \u2014 and matter of fact, I saw, when I was a kid, and when the\nHungarian soldier marched by in the 40 \u2014 in the 40s, and they stopped \u2014 the\nsoldiers, they \u2014 they stopped the regiment over there, right in front of the shul, and\none of the Hungarian officer, he says to two, three guys, he says, there\u2019s a lot of\nJews there, I want you to pull their ber \u2014 beard out and hit them. You know, so they\npulled the beard, they hit them, they kept on going. And this, you know, this \u2014 this\nthing kept telling me, eating and eating inside, why, why, why? Because why are\nthey doing that, because I have another religion? There\u2019s so many religions, well\nwhy pick my religion? So it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s start to be, you know, and it never went\naway, it\u2019s still the same thing, I still feel why, why, why they did it to us? Why they\ndid it small children things like this, and with no mercy whatsoever.",
        "Q: When did you begin to realize just how much the Jewish people had suffered?",
        "A: Soon \u2014 soon you went out of the camps, when we went out of the concentration\ncamp and you see the Jewish people there. You know, you could have see people,\nyou know, putting on the twill and stuff, praying over there, and then from the back\nhe got shot because he\u2019s putting on twill, something like this, you know. And\nOctober 22, 1997\nanother \u2014 the \u2014 stay there and they pick up their hands and pray to God to come a\nmiracle, they got killed. The miracle was they got killed. So you could see your own\nJewish people. Look, I am Jewish. I wouldn\u2019t change my religion if you killed me.\nEven I went through all the prosecution thing, whatever they did to me, it \u2014 I like\nvery much where I am, but [indecipherable] we have our own \u2014 our own thing\nbetween the extremists and the thing, so 1-it\u2019s not such a good idea, I think we\nshould get a little more better united than [indecipherable]. In case God forbid\nsomething like this comes around, we should be united, which we were not united\nthose days, because there were too extreme, and they all \u2014 and they forced us to be\nextreme and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel like being extreme, we just wanted to be\ngood Jewish people. And little by little starts up and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What you were just saying, was that a reference to before the war?",
        "A: Yes, before the war, when we were kids, the religion was so strong, they force\nyou to do things, which you didn\u2019t even feel like doing all those things. Because\nthey were so afraid you gon \u2014 you not \u2014 you gonna be a non-Jew. And I think that\nwas the wrong way to force somebody to be a Jew, because you have to be the\nextreme way. You could be a go \u2014 a good Jew, and you could be Jew in your heart,\nand \u2014 and not to be the extreme way, to be \u2014 to God and to people. For God and for\n[indecipherable] you know, you have to be both ways, you cannot do things in one\nOctober 22, 1997\nway. And we suffered a lot for that, because we were not united, even those days.\nWhen I wanted to go to Palestine, they told me I\u2019m gonna be a goy, I\u2019m not gonna\nbe a Jew after all, I wanted to come to United States, or any other place. I had be\njust in \u2014 in that place where in that town over there, where you could grow up a\ngood Jew. The misery was so bad in there, there was no food, there was no nothing,\nbut the religion was on top. First the religion, and then it came the food. No, it wa \u2014\nit was very hard to \u2014 and then you could see what\u2019s going on, you know, and you\nhave different idea, you think different, and \u2014 and the problem arrived little by little.",
        "Q: So we have to pause so I can change tape.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nOctober 22, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Bernard Pasternak. This is tape two, side A. And you were telling\nme about the decision to come to United States and let\u2019s go with how you got to\nthe United States.",
        "A: After I was in the \u2014 in Austria and Salzburg, camp name was Reidenburg, we\nprepared, you know, I mean people start moving out, they start going to Israel, start\ngoing to other countries. A lot of visas came in from almost all over the western\nworld, that they take in so many people, so many people. And due to the fact my\naunt, she wrote us we should come to the United States first, so of course you have\nto prepare yourself to come to the State to see, because like my aunt said, so few\nwere left of her \u2014 of my sister\u2019s children, I would like very much you should come\nhere first, but then you make your destination further. So we start preparing to do \u2014\ncome to the \u2014 the United States. There was a lot of visas you could go in any other\ncountry, like my brother-in-law went to South America. And I had friends, they\nwent to Australia. They went all over the world, but my aim was now the United\nStates. So from Austria they did not take people yet to go to the United States. So\nwe heard in Italy this \u2014 it\u2019s a faster quota there, you could go faster from Italy to\nthe States. So we went to Italy. We went some friends and we went to Italy. So, it\nOctober 22, 1997\n\u2014 it didn\u2019t go so smooth either. We had to \u2014 from Salzburg we had to go to\nInnsbruck. From Innsbruck \u2014 this is Austria, from Innsbruck in the area, to go\nover the border to Italy. So Italy was already independent, and they had the \u2014\nwatching the border there, and a \u2014 soldier were there and we were trying to go over\nthe border, they caught us a few times. That\u2019s why I will never forget those Italian\nthat time. They caught us twice, and due to the fact I speak Romanian, and it wasn\u2019t\ntoo much a \u2014 of a differential for the Italian, so I start talking to the guy, he ask me,\nwhere you go? I says, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m looking for a be \u2014 a better world. I\u2019m looking for\nthe \u2014 to settle myself. He say, you want to settle Italy? I says, no, I have an aunt in\nthe United States. He says, okay, but right now what we have to do with you guy,\nwe have to send you back, because that\u2019s the rule. And next time we\u2019ll see. It just\nhappened, the guards there, they saw what\u2019s coming, and they turn around the other\nway and they say, Avanti! Avanti! Avanti! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. So we went\nover the border, and we took a train, and we went into Meran, not Milano, Meran.\nThis is then the northern part between Austria and Italy. So we went into that city\nover there. Of course, the Joint was there already. And from Meran they made\narrangements, and we went to Milano. And also they had the camp there, only\ntransit. Meran was a transit camp and Milano was a transit camp. So they, from\nthere we sh \u2014 we went to a place not f-far from Meran, they called it Chiari after,\nOctober 22, 1997\nChiari. In that they had a camp already established to go to is \u2014 to Israel, to go to\nany other place, or to United States. It was a faster \u2014 you know, faster \u2014 you get\nvisa much faster over there to go wherever you gonna go. So I was in that place in\nChiari for a little while, and then I heard that if you go to Bari, it\u2019s much faster\nfrom Bari. So we went by train, it took all night. The train were going a little faster\nthan in Romania, so we went all night, we went to Bari. Bari had a camp which it\nwas the \u2014 you could have stayed there and there\u2019s camps there, but there was\nanother place not far from Bari, they called it Trani. And we went to that camp, it\nalso was about five hours or so with the train, approximately. So we went into\nTrani over there, and we stood there for a little while, a f\u2014 months already. The\nwhole thing took a year and a half or something like this, wh-what I\u2019m telling you,\nbetween Austria and Italy all those things. So when it came, there was a delegation\nover there, and they start taking all the refugee people to go to the United States.\nNow, it wasn\u2019t so easy to come to United States. First of all, you had to go through\nfrom he \u2014 head to tail, they \u2014 they checked you out. Well, they checked out you in\ngeneral, and they find out \u2014 and they wanted to know if you have anybody\nsponsoring you. And wanted to know if you have a trade and the feeling, and all\nthose things. And how intelligent you are, they showed something to look. And in\nbooks, something to figure out numbers like they do it for children now, they put it\nOctober 22, 1997\none, two, thr-three together. I did put them \u2014 I could put them all together because\nthe colors were so funny, I could put them together. So the bottom line, everything\nwas set, and it \u2014 did they come that we are ready to go to the United States. So\nfrom there, from Bari we went to Naples. We stood there for a little while, I think\nthey had some kind of a strike that time, so we hanged out to Naples. And \u2014 and\nthen finally we had a boat, we had [indecipherable] a boat \u2014 matter of fact, they\njust brought some soldiers over to Italy and the boat was empty to go back, and the\nboat\u2019s name was General Greely. So we went in in the boat in there, and of course,\nafter being so hungry all those years, I was watching to eat because I shouldn\u2019t get\nsick again. But I\u2014 I was always hungry. Matter of fact, I\u2019m even hungry now. I\nmean, I cannot full myself up from those bad days. So I went to the boat, we went\nin there and right away I volunteer to work. Because wherever I went in Italy, I\nworked. I made some money in the \u2014 all those places where I stood, I always look\nfor a\u2014 sometimes I worked in the camp, they paid, because the Italian government\npaid for that. So I had some money and tell you, the first time I saw what life is\nwhen I was in Italy. First of all, the people were so nice. It\u2019s a different type of\npeople over there, and so friendly and generous. And I had money, and I never\nknow how to live, and this \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 tell you, this I \u2014 I know this 1s the best life\nwhat I ever had up til now, because all the \u2014 matter of fact, we went into \u2014 the\nOctober 22, 1997\ngovernment was so nice in general to us. We went in, when we were in Milano, and\nthere was a theater playing that time in this [indecipherable] Milano. I went in\nthere and th-there was no room whatsoever, but due to the fact we told them we are\n\u2014 we are fr \u2014 refugees, so \u2014 which I speak the language already. We are refugees, so\nright away they made us at home and they took us in there to see the opera. And I\nwas not much interested in opera thing, so I walked right out the other way, you\nknow, they shouldn\u2019t see me, they made so much effort to get me in. So I walked\nout. And there was other places which I was interested and they gave us so much\nrespect for the \u2014 because we were refugee, profugo they called it, we are refugees.\nMatter of fact, a lot of time you could have go from one place to the other over the\ntrain free because they know you are a refugee, and what you went through. So\nfinally we go in the boat, General Greely. I said \u2014 they ask volunteers, I went to\nwork in the kitchen, where the food is. So I went to work in there in the kitchen, and\nI was doing \u2014 in Italy I traveled around from one place to the other one. I went to a\nlot of place; I went to Pompeii, I went to other places. I went to see, you know, all\nthe old places, and I went to Assisi. Well, ha \u2014 you name it, I went all over Italy to\nsee, because I had an opportunity to travel. So I worked in the kitchen in the boat, I\nworked in the kitchen. And the third day I got so sick, I got so sick with all the food.\nMatter of fact, it\u2019s not only me, the whole boat got sick. Everybody got sick\nOctober 22, 1997\n[indecipherable] throw all the food around there. It was something. But I have\nsome friends, they live now in Queens on \u2014 in New York. And just a couple of\nguys, they were standing there and they were laughing [indecipherable] and then\nnothing affected them whatsoever. So it took a few days pass the island of Capri,\nand the boat to come in. And a few days after we come to ourselves you know, and\nwe start acting a little bit normal. But the boat, it was some kind of a storm, and you\ncould see the boat, you know, th-the plates in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the mess hall where\npeople were eating, you see, while they were eating, the soup was going one place\nto the other one, it was going back and forth with the boat and rockling the boat.\nAnd finally we come to our desti \u2014 destination. We c \u2014 we came to New York. Now",
        "Q: I want to ask you what expectations you had for America before you came to\nNew York.",
        "A: Well, I had \u2014I figured I have a trade, which it didn\u2019t do much good in this\ncountry because they were doing different, but I had a start. And th-the whole thing\nwas in my head just to settle down and \u2014 and to start living like a human being, not\nto travel around all over. So when I arrived in the \u2014 1n the country, they \u2014 we came\nstraight in the harbor in New York City. I could never find out where the boat\nlanded, it was in December 1949. I could never find out which harbor it come in. I\nOctober 22, 1997\nwanted to go see the \u2014 really the place. Soon I walked down, there was a lot of\norganization, there was Christian organization, other organization waiting for their\nrefugees, because in the boat was not only Jewish people, because there was\nrefugees from \u2014 almost from all the Eastern Bloc. Some refugees were fr \u2014 they\nwere Russians, from Russia they came. They were Polish, but they were in Russia.\nSome refugees [indecipherable] they run away from the Germans, and some of\nthem they run away from the Russian. I don\u2019t know what kind of a people, what\ntheir background was, what their pol \u2014 politic was, I don\u2019t know. They were\nscreened in \u2014 in Italy before they came, I don\u2019t know. So they \u2014 those organizations\nright away we had \u2014 like I had something written HIAS in my shirt, some people\nhad different organization. So we had to go to the \u2014 each group. Matter of fact, I\nwalked over to a Christian organization, I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s all about, and then \u2014\nand the \u2014 the woman was so nice, he says, no, he says, the Jude organization is\nright across on the other side on the hall. So when I came over, the HIAS on\nLafayette Street in New York City had already established for refugees who came\nover from the other side. They had room and board and they were looking for jobs\nfor them, they took us downtown to the \u2014 in another place, to the Joint. I forgot the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the street over there, where they took us in there, and \u2014 and what the\ninterview was for jobs, what we know. So that time, when I came from Italy, my\nOctober 22, 1997\nsisters were here already. They ca \u2014 they \u2014 they came from Austria because they\nwere single and it was easier to get them out. So my sister and my brother came\nalready. And they waited me \u2014 they waited for me six months before they came,\nthey waited for me. First of all, I could have come really before. I didn\u2019t want to\nleave Italy. I had such a good life over there, why leave such a good life? Why go\naway? But my friends told me, this life is good, but United States even is a better\nlife. I say, what do you mean? So they says to me, did you see the Marshall plan,\nan-and all over Austria and Germany and Italy? I say yes. He says, you see, all the\nstar \u2014 things comes from the United States. Could you imagine if you go to the\nsource where you got all those things? And there how good it could we? So I let\nmyself talk in, I say you are right and we came over. And when we were \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 the arrangement from the organization, they made arrangement we should\ngo to Lafayette Street. But my sisters \u2014 sisters and my brother told me, he says, it\u2019s\nnot so cozy with my aunt, the way she wrote we should go. First thing my aunt did,\nshe looked all over our packages, she figured we have a lot of money in there, we\nbrought over from Europe. So it was a different aim and so soon they saw me, they\nsay, you not going to my aunt, he says, you go to the HIAS in there, and \u2014 and be\nestablished from over there, whatever you have to do. You want to go from there.\nSo I find they already give me all the information there, so I went to the HIAS.\nOctober 22, 1997\nNow they took taxis, they had taxis to take from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the thing \u2014\nfrom the boat there, from the terminal there. They had taxis to take you to the\nHIAS. I walked on the street, and I \u2014 with my head down, I looked down. So the\nguys asked me in Yiddish, he says to me, what are you looking for? Wassusto(ph).\nI said well, I was told there\u2019s a lot of money in the streets in the United States, I\nthought maybe I could pick some \u2014 maybe I could pick up some. The guy says to\nme in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish]. Til you gonna see a dollar, you\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019re gonna\nget black and blue til you gonna find a dollar here. You gotta work your head off. I\nsays to my friend, see why we came? You gonna work your head off, you had such\na good life in Italy. So he says to me, one guy which you get a \u2014 still in contact \u2014\nwe still have a few friends we are in contact from the camps. They are spread all\nover. So, I says to him, okay, let\u2019s see the bottom line what\u2019s gonna happen. So we\n\u2014 I always wanted to go back to Italy. Whatever I did, I wasn\u2019t happy, I just wanted\nto go to Italy, I want to go to Italy. So once got together with my sister and my bro\n\u2014 my brother. He sits down there, he says to me, look, we know you had a good life\nin Italy, better than we had in Austria, because it\u2019s a different country, different\n[indecipherable] with better things in there. But I want to tell you something, my\nbrother says to me, when you came with the boat, did you see the Statue of Liberty?\nI say, what\u2019s the Statue of Liberty? Did you see somebody like a woman holding\nOctober 22, 1997\none hand up and one hand down, with a book\u2019? I say yeah. He says, you know what\nthat means by us refugee? The hand up means welcome to United States. The hand\ndown means, you never gonna leave the United States. Here you gonna be buried\nand die in the United States, you never gonna leave that. So we all start laughing\nand that\u2019s what it happened, exactly what happened, you just go [indecipherable]\nthink like this, so you\u2019ll always come back to the United States. So we were in the\nHIAS a week or so, and then they took us to a \u2014 to the Joint in there to start\ninterviewing us. What kind of \u2014 they had a big \u2014 big building over there, just \u2014 I just\nforgot the place. And there was a lot of people, they interview you in your own\nlanguage, [indecipherable] what job you could know, what job you could do. And I\ntold them what I could do, and \u2014 but in the meantime til they find something, I \u2014 my\naunt had a cousin here, and he was a tinsmith. So in the meantime, I \u2014 I \u2014 of \u2014 I just\n\u2014I\u2014I was without work maybe \u2014 maybe, maybe two months. So he says to me,\nlook, a temporary thing til you get the real job, you come work for me. I have work\nfor a\u2014 once in a while I have a little work. I do roofing, I do other thing, repairing.\nSo I says, okay. So got a few dollars that time, for \u2014 so I went to work for him, he\nwas someplace in \u2014 in Brooklyn, and you had \u2014 go travel from New York to\nBrooklyn, if you don\u2019t know you \u2014 you know, you don\u2019t know your way, you don\u2019t\nknow the language. So I supposed to start eight o\u2019clock, I used to leave 5:30 in the\nOctober 22, 1997\nmorning because I left a few hours for going from one place to the other one, one\ntrain \u2014 I traveled all over the city before I re \u2014 I reached the destination. I think it\nwas in Grammerton(ph) Avenue in Brooklyn, he had a job, til I got used, better\nand better. And my uncle wanted to show off that he\u2019s a real American when I used\nto go downtown from him from \u2014 fr \u2014 when I used to go with him, travel around\nfrom one place to the other one. So he bought a newspaper, he looks in the\nnewspaper \u2014 I don\u2019t even think he knew how to read that time because the\nnewspaper wasn\u2019t even straight. So he takes the paper, looks in it, he comes to the\nstation the next day, he throws it in the garbage. He says, you see, that\u2019s what you\ndo in United States. You look in the newspaper, you have no time to, you throw it\naway. I don\u2019t even think he knows anything in that thing because he couldn\u2019t read at\nall. Why he wanted to make an impression to me, that he \u2014 and then I went out\nafter, I went out with my cousins and they took me around, they took me to ice\ncream parlor. And I go in there and get an ice cream. She says, you know what you\nwith that? You lick it. I said, no kidding, I said, I didn\u2019t know you lick ice cream. I\nsays, you think I come from the mountains, I didn\u2019t have ice cream in Italy, or in\nany other place? So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want [indecipherable] so I\u2019m glad you told me,\nat least you teach me something, you know, weth \u2014 important thing. So finally I got\n\u2014 I went back for the interview and for the job, and they still couldn\u2019t find the right\nOctober 22, 1997\njob for me. I find some people who we came over with the boat together, I ask\nthem, where you working? So they told me, I\u2019m working there and there in a metal\nfactory, but it\u2019s so dirty over there, we couldn\u2019t take the dirt. So he says, but I\u2019m\nsure with your background, I think you could get a job over there and you could\nwork in there, provided you like the grease and the dirt. So I went in the place for an\ninterview, and the guy was talking to me in English, what the heck, I know English,\nI know a few word, okay, okay [indecipherable]. So he says to me, first I want you\nto go try my friend, he has a place over there and see if he could get you a job. So I\nwent over to the guy over there someplace in Manhattan. I went in there, I see\npeople working, cutting wood and other thing, just \u2014 just a regular work. Went in\nthere, he start talking to me, I didn\u2019t understand not one word he was saying. I had\nto work harder, I say okay, okay, I don\u2019t understand a word. I mean, to give me the\ncourtesy, I speak so many languages, can\u2019t you talk to me in a different type of\nlanguage? So was sticking to the English. So then I went back to the \u2014 to the place\nwhere the guy told me he is working. I went in there and comes out \u2014 the guy comes\nout first, interviews me and then the boss comes out and checks out the interview,\nsee \u2014 he looks at me, he says, you know, I see something in you. I\u2019m gonna give\nyou a job. And I\u2019m gonna try you out, see what you could do. So I went in in that\nfactory over there, machinery, dust flying all over, because that time they didn\u2019t\nOctober 22, 1997\ncare too much about the pollution, all those thing. And I went in there and I would\ntake anything, because if you have no language, I mean you don\u2019t know the\nlanguage, you have to take what you can. So I went in there and start working.",
        "Q: When you came to the United States, did you feel welcome by the Americans?",
        "A: I felt welcome almost by everybody because I have my tattoo number from\nAuschwitz, and it was summer too, and I was going without the jacket. And matter\nof fact, some of the American people, they even got up and get me the seat, even the\nolder people, they says, here, sit down, I see you standing up. But I was very\nwelcome by the Jewish people in general, talking about the \u2014 the refugees, wa \u2014 all\nthey went through. And also some of the people and \u2014 and \u2014 in \u2014 in the job, they\nwere afraid that something is wrong with me because I went to a camp, or maybe I\ndid some kind of a criminal activities I did, why di \u2014 they put me in a camp, because\nthey couldn\u2019t understand why I was, you know, in prison for something like this. So\nit was very hard to explain, which I could not explain, but after they saw pictures,\nand they saw the newspapers, so they start to get a little bit educated more, a-and\nstart to accept me. But I should say, the worst \u2014 somebody to call me Jew, or thing\nlike this, yes I do have encounter with the people who were working. I \u2014 I\nunderstand already a little bit, and I remember one guy used to call me hey Jew-\nboy, come over here, hey, Jew-boy. I figured that\u2019s the way you call somebody\nOctober 22, 1997\nover, til somebody else told me what it means. But I couldn\u2019t do nothing anyhow,\nand I didn\u2019t want to start up anything because like I said, I was afraid for the job,\nan-and that guy was a little leader over there. And on the end, we worked together\nwith the guy, but I never trusted him because he never trusted me either. So he was\ndoing some mechanical thing and I was doing different thing. And I did not\nencounter anything, I would say, went in in a store, thing like this, cause \u2014 what \u2014\nno \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say ant \u2014 anti-Semitic thing when I came to this country. Maybe I\ndidn\u2019t understand, I didn\u2019t speak the language, but [indecipherable] I think it\nturned out pretty good.",
        "Q: Did people ask you about your experiences when you came? Did Americans ask\nyou?",
        "A: Yes, there was a lot of talk about it when they went to the shul in France, and\nwhen I use \u2014 started \u2014 started going out with girl, they ask me the background, what\nhappened. And like I say, soon they saw my number, they know I went through\nhell. And they tried to understand, but I couldn\u2019t make nobody understand, because\nnobody could believe it.",
        "Q: What did you \u2014 what did you tell them?",
        "A: I told them the experiences. I was a kid I was taking away because I was Jewish,\nand I was taking so many different thing, and exterminate the family, just because\nOctober 22, 1997\nthey were Jewish. And it was very hard to understand for the people in general. But\nlater on when I start already speaking the language, then it was a different \u2014 I\nexplain it to them different and then they start to accept what I went through.",
        "Q: You said that you started going out with girls and \u2014 and started having a\u2014a\nsocial life. Tell me about your social life in your early days in the United States.",
        "A: When I start working first in the job, I was starting with 70 cents an hour. But I\nwould say the boss liked me and I start working overtime. So it was a heck of a\ndirty job in general. It was so dirty that a shower wouldn\u2019t take off that dirt, that\nblack stuff. But I already had money, so you start thinking about settling down and\nstart having a different social life. So I used to go out with \u2014 with girls in general,\nbut somehow, we were afraid \u2014 the refugee, they were afraid for the American girls.\nWhy? Soon you start talking to them, the first question, do you have a car? I said, I\ndon\u2019t even have a bicycle, not a car, I mean I just came, you want me to have a car?\nSo then I was afraid, I didn\u2019t date it the second time, because who knows if she asks\nfor a car, what will happen later on, what you ask? So, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t bother. But\na few years later, about two years later I did bought a car, because I had better\nopportunities to date girls. So I took them out. I ha \u2014 I\u2019m very poor, you know, in\nthe sense of direction, I only know \u2014 if I go out someplace and turn back, sometimes\nI lose my sense of direction. And I also, I am colorblind, so I had those two\nOctober 22, 1997\nproblems. And \u2014 but those girls, they know their way and I tell them I want to go\nthere, I say, but I never been there before, which it wasn\u2019t true, I was there before, I\n\u2014 but I didn\u2019t know how to get there again. So they directed me over there, and I\nhad a 1942 Dodge. [ had a lot of trouble with that car, but I kept it running just to\nget better dates and which it happened to me and \u2014 but the thing 1s this, I still \u2014 I\nwas sitting in the car one time, I never forget, and I said, enough is enough, I say, I\nshould settle down and start living a family life. And I say, well, you find the right\ngirl, you say, you just can\u2019t jump into something like this. So we did \u2014 we dated\nvery few American girls, and most of them we dated our own type of girls. Not\nnecessary Romanian, it could be from any other country we dated, because our view\nwas different, our aim was different and we had nobody you know, we had to stick\nto each other, so it was a different type of dating.",
        "Q: S-So how then did you meet your wife?",
        "A: Well, I was going her \u2014 with a girl from Czechoslovakia. And you know, if\nsomebody pushes you, you push back, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 you go a step back.\nShe was pushing me to get married, she was nice lady, good looking, everything\nwas right, but somehow, I was pressed too much, you say, when you gonna marry,\nwhen you gonna marry? And I wasn\u2019t ready that time. So that time \u2014 the refugees\nused to get together in Manhattan in Hotel Diplomat. You always find, whenever\nOctober 22, 1997\nyou wanted to go to a dance, or you want to meet somebody, you could meet them\nat two places, on front of the HIAS, Lafayette Street, or in \u2014 in Hotel Diplomat,\nthere you could meet. So I went with her to a dance. Didn\u2019t know how to dance\nreally, but I went to a dance. I start learning how to dance, and so we saw a lot of\nfriends there, we got together a lot of friends over there. And then she says to me,\nmeet my friend. So I meet \u2014 met her friend, and said hi, things like this. And then I\nlook in the friend, I say gee, I would like to marry that girl, because she had\neverything what I really wanted. I always liked black eye, dark eyes. I alwa \u2014\nbecause Europe most of them got blue eyes \u2014 matter of fact, I have blue eyes, too \u2014\nI always wanted somebody in the darker side, because most of them are, like I said,\nblonde. And she had all the thing I \u2014 what a girl could have, and I wanted to meet\nher very bad, and so little by little, I ask her for a date, but she had somebody \u2014\ngoing with somebody. I didn\u2019t succeed the first time, I didn\u2019t succeed the second\ntime, so I kept on pushing, not the strong way, because I had a lesson from the other\ngirl, you had to approach very easy. So I \u2014 finally we had a date. She lived in\n[indecipherable] by her aunt. She also from eu \u2014 Europe, she came from\nTransylvania, Romania and Hungary, and she was by an aunt or by a cousin in\nMount Vernon. She came in 1946 as a kid the \u2014 with the children transport. And I\nwent out with her once or twice and \u2014 and looks like she was not too much\nOctober 22, 1997\ninterested in me and you can\u2019t press something like this, has to come mostly natural,\nand we broke off. That time, I have in \u2014 in papers here, that I \u2014 the Korean War was\non that time and I went to register to the army. I was trained already, might as well\ndo some service for the United States. So I went to register it, and the registration\nto the army was [indecipherable] Arthur Avenue. And I got my registration thing\nand then they called me back to see \u2014 fi-first they gave me 1-A, they took \u2014 call me\nback, I passed all the physical, I passed everything. I didn\u2019t pass the language, I\ndidn\u2019t speak the language, just a little bit. So the guy says to me, language is no\ngood, we need somebody who speaks English and we have no schooling over there,\nthings like this. And you could make one mistake, the whole platoon could die fe \u2014\nbecause you don\u2019t speak the language. And I got 4-F. And I\u2019m carrying around the\n1-A and the 4-F with me since I \u2014 when I went to register to the army. So I didn\u2019t\nsucceed. My wife now, she find out \u2014 which her name is Bella, Brocha(ph) 1n \u2014 in\nYiddish, she find out that I am going to the Korea \u2014 to the war. So she picked up\nthe phone and she asked me, 1s true you are going to the army? I says yeah, I just\nsaid, I\u2019m supposed to go to the army, I am waiting. And then the meantime I \u2014 give\nme a lot of courage, because she called, and I said, would you like to go out for a\ndate? She says, okay, before you go to the Korean War, I go out with you. So I went\nout with her once, I went out with her twice, and it came through that 4-F. She was\nOctober 22, 1997\ngoing with somebody, if she cared, she didn\u2019t care too much. The cousin where she\nwas living, so she says, gee I\u2019m torn \u2014 my wife says, I\u2019m torn between two things,\nshe says. I got this guy, and I got this guy. I says, what do I do? So the uncle, or the\ncousin, he says to her, look, I don\u2019t know much about the other guy, but I could tell\nyou this; Bernie comes from Mamurish(ph) and I know all those people, they work\nvery hard, and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t go hungry. And it looks like he did the trick\nand finally we go out again. And we went in Mount Vernon in the \u2014 and parked\nthere in the park there, we sat down over there and I ask her, I says, look, would you\ntry to get more serious and thing? So we went \u2014 went around for a while. A serious\nthing, they called it steady that time. But my family wasn\u2019t too keen about her,\nbecause my wife has a \u2014 she talks a little loud, but she means nothing, but that\u2019s the\nway she talks and they couldn\u2019t accept her to \u2014 right away. But I saw in her a\ndifferent thing. I saw in her a smart, and knows what she\u2019s doing. And I saw in her\nthat we could have a nice future together, because I am not a businessman. I would\nbe very well off if I were to be a businessman. I\u2019m not a businessman type and she\nis. So she had \u2014 she was always a step ahead of me, whatever I wanted to do. So\nthen, when I was talking to my family, I says look, I says look, this girl who I\u2019m\ngonna marry, she has more than \u2014 than you think with \u2014 with all the things she says,\nwe \u2014 So they said look, it\u2019s your life and your decision, things like this. If she says \u2014\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecause I wanted \u2014 not that I wanted to get their permission to marry her, I just\nwanted they should give me \u2014 you know, to say look, I don\u2019t want to divide the\nfamily. And then they says, if you think so \u2014 so highly about her, we\u2019ll accept your\n\u2014 your knowhow, your thinking. And let\u2019s see, let\u2019s plan and see what\u2019s gonna work\nout. And we had our cousin, he was in the jewel business, and we\u2019re talking to him\nfor a ring. This cousin \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to buy a ring and she shou-shouldn\u2019t like it.\nBy the way, I already had 1500 dollars saved, which I was in the country two years,\nand that\u2019s a heck of a lot of money because I work so much overtime. And I wanted\nher to encourage that \u2014 like the cousin said, that she not gonna go hungry, so I\nwanted to encourage her, and I was working that time seven days a week and 10 -\n11 hours a day. I had a check of 250 dollar. I was working 70 cents an hour. So\nwhen we went to take out the marriage license that time, I had loose change, I says\nto her, I says, look, Bella, I don\u2019t have any change you could see, but I have my\ncheck, you cash it tomorrow, and you pay for the license, two dollar, which I tease\nher up \u2014 up to today I say, you paid for me. So she give \u2014 paid the two dollar, I gave\nher the check, and she saw the check 250 dollar [indecipherable] have to make\nover 300, 350 that time. And as saw the check, she was [indecipherable] right\naway, she says, gee, this guy makes a lot of money. Because people used to make\n60, 70 dollar a week that time, and I had 250 dollar, single guy. So I don\u2019t know if\nOctober 22, 1997\nthat impressed her to marry me, because she \u2014 she didn\u2019t care for money, never\ncared for money in general. So \u2014 but it \u2014 it helped, I wouldn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t help.\nAnd she \u2014 they took the check and cashed it, you know, and \u2014 and I says, you open\na bank \u2014 we \u2014 we were only talking about getting engaged. And she had the cousin\nthat he was in the jewelry business, and I had 1500 dollar, and then she picked out\nthe ring of 1200 dollar. So it\u2019s \u2014 were a little over a carat, a carat and a quarter,\nsomething like that. She picked out that ring, so I paid the 1200 dollar for the ring.",

        "Q: \u2014 of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Bernard\nPasternak. This is tape two, side B. When did you get married?",
        "A: I got married in June 1953. \u201953. \u201953. June 1953. I\u2014I had to think twice because I\ndidn\u2019t remember it\u2019s \u00b054 or \u00b053, but it was *53, June 1953.",
        "Q: What were your plans, your ambitions, the two of you?",
        "A: Well, first of all, we were talking a lot when we were engaged, about having a\nfamily together, how we should bring up the kids. I was not too \u2014 I was brought up\nin an Orthodox home, strictly Orthodox, to be, you know, to be \u2014 having really\nJewish faith. So when I got out of the camp, it \u2014 that \u2014 it cooled off a little bit, in\nOctober 22, 1997\ngeneral, for me. And she was \u2014 she was more religious, because my wife\u2019s family\ncomes from more a religious background. Not that my family didn\u2019t come, but it\nwas a different background because he had a brother, he was a shochet and some\nrabbis in the family. So she says to me, I want to bring up the \u2014 my children Jewish,\nthe real Jewish way. And like I was saying, we were very smart, in general, and I\nwent \u2014 I went along right away. The only question I says, where the heck you gonna\nget so much money? I says, there\u2019s nobody gonna give you here, you have to do it\nall wi \u2014 we have to do it all on our own. She says, we\u2019ll make it, God will help us\nand we\u2019ll make it. She also was telling me a story, when they \u2014 they build a school,\nthe Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck, and she went to visit there with \u2014\nwith the family there, where she was staying. And that was in the \u2014 probably in \u201946\n- \u00b047, when they build that school. So she says to the family, this is where I\u2019m\ngonna send my children. And she was telling me the story, so she says, I\u2019m gonna\nsend them in that school. And they \u2014 you know, they were very, very expensive\nschools, things like this. So she says, I\u2019m gonna work too. I says, how you gonna\nwork with small kid, thing like this. So she says, Pll manage somehow. She was\nworking bi \u2014 the year we had our son Jerry, but she was working in the dress line.\nShe was so good on that dress line that she became a sample maker. You\u2019re not\ngonna believe this, she worked til the day she gave birth. Like she\u2019s worked til five\nOctober 22, 1997\no\u2019clock and eight o\u2019clock was I took her to the hospital. And she was so good in\nthat thing, that where she was working, she had to go to the doctor every week or\nso, and this fellow by the dress line, he took her to the doctor, waited for her,\nbecause she was so good. And when she had the baby, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the fellow\ncame over to take the sample back, because she didn\u2019t even finish the sample. Now,\nwhen our ambition was very much to see how we could better ourself, and even\nhow to better somebody else\u2019s too, you know, with who \u2014 people you are together,\nlearn one from each other one. So for \u2014 we moved in an apartment, it was in the\nBronx. And it was [indecipherable] over there, it was in the dirt floor. And we\nwere \u2014 when I went to the hospital, I was so excited that my wife was sitting down,\nshe says, give me a glass of water, because we went to the hospital. I say why? The\n\u2014 the water busted. And I got such a bang I jumped up. I thought somebody hit me\nin the back. And when we got up she said, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t be scared. Th-The\nwater busted, we gotta go to the hospital She said, give me a glass of water\n[indecipherable] call a taxi. You think I could call a taxi? I didn\u2019t even know how\nto \u2014 I was so excited, I couldn\u2019t even call the taxi. And then she says to me, give me\na glass of water, I don\u2019t feel too good. Now who drank the water? I drank the water,\nbecause \u2014 and she said, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m gonna get my own water, because you can\u2019t\neven give me a glass of water. And then we went out, we got a taxi to go to Jewish\nOctober 22, 1997\nMemorial Hospital, and the guy didn\u2019t even know where Jewish Memorial Hospital\nis, the taxi driver, so she had to explain where it is. So I went into the hospital, went\nin there to the hospital. And by the time I turn around, I didn\u2019t do anything,\nsomebody comes by, she says it\u2019s a boy. Fast. And the next day I went back to\nwork, I went up [indecipherable] and the next day I went back to work. I brought\nthe kid home on third floor, but we couldn\u2019t \u2014 it was close to go to work for me, but\nit really wasn\u2019t a place to raise family because third floor. The neighborhood was\ngood, so we went to Crotona Park. They had a park there, they call it Crotona\npark. [indecipherable] So to get this apartment, we are now, we had to pay the \u2014\nthat time you had to pay \u2014 they call it the key money [indecipherable] you had to\npay. We paid a few hundred dollar to get this apartment. And then we \u2014 we had\nsomebody who knows in \u2014 in Yonkers. They lived in the \u2014 in Hilltop Acres, the\nplace was called Hilltop Acres. They lived over there and they says, 1-1-if you get \u2014\ngo there and you talk to the landlord in there probably, there\u2019s a lot of development\nthere, lot of apartment. And also you had to pay that time, too. So we give the guy\nsome money over there, he gives us a three room apartment over there. But that was\nnot right away, because it took time, and by the \u2014 by that time she was pregnant\nwith the second kid and \u2014 and on the same thing happened, but this \u2014 this \u2014 this\nchild was not born in Jewish Memorial, he was born in Bronx Levin Hospital.\nOctober 22, 1997\n[indecipherable] Bronx Levin on there. So we went to that hospital. I was a little\nmore calm, I had a little experience because it was two years. And when he was a\nfew months, second boy, we had that apartment, in which they called 90 si \u2014\nHilltop Acres, the number was 96. So we lived there for quite a while. And then I\nhad another child, it was also a boy. But the thing is, they all \u2014 they all were born \u2014\none was born June 17. My second child was born June 18. And I wanted to have an\nanniversary present, he should be born in June the 27\", so he stretched it til a\nminute past the 12 and he came June the 28\". So I lost out in that one. Then we\nwent to that new apartment, which it was in Hilltop Acres. And we had the three\nroom apartment. And soon this \u2014 the other one, they went to school. First they went\nto kindergarten and went to school, and my wife picked up something \u2014 something\nelse. She picked up real estate.",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 how did you pick the names for your sons?",
        "A: Well, where she came \u2014 where my wife came to this cousin we \u2014 she called him\nuncle, but he was a cousin. His daughter got married and the doctor said she cannot\nhave any children. So she wanted to do something real important for those people.\nSo the first son was named after this cousin\u2019s father. His name is the \u2014 1-1s\n[indecipherable] English is the name Jerry. So he was named after his cousin,\nthink. Now, my second child I couldn\u2019t name after my father because the first name\nOctober 22, 1997\nmy father was Moishe Zev and \u2014 and \u2014 and my son\u2019s the f\u2014 name is Yehude(ph)\nZev, so I couldn\u2019t name any more after my father because my father\u2019s name, half of\nthem is by the first son. So my wife \u2014 so, I was talking to my family and I says,\nlook, I like to give a name and what can I \u2014 I can\u2019t name after my mother because\nit\u2019s not a girl. So we had a discussion and I talked to my wife. So my father \u2014 I\nnamed him after my father father, Shmol(ph) David also to be close, my father\nshould have a name. So this is the way I got the second name. And this cous \u2014 the\nfirst name always belongs to the wife, the second name to the man and if the third\none, it goes again to the wife. So the third name was Yithzak(ph) Shlomo(ph), and\nmy wife named him after her father and after a brother who also got perished in the\nHolocaust. So this is the way we picked the three names.",
        "Q: What did you tell your sons about your childhood before the war?",
        "A: Well, first of all, what I tell them, it\u2019s very hard to believe, but they only believe\nbecause the parents are telling them. I tried to tell them what happened with those\npeople, what happened if people are not united, if \u2014 what happened if, you know,\nyou don\u2019t trust each other. And even all those things you know, it \u2014 I was\npersecuted because I\u2019m a Jew and I hope you gonna keep up the faith and be a Jew\nbecause they didn\u2019t want you to be a\u2014 me to be a Jew, but I kept up the faith, and I\nwant you ke \u2014 people to keep up the faith. And they promise me they gonna do it,\nOctober 22, 1997\nand which they are doing it right now, which I\u2019m very proud of them, what they\ndoing. Soon my older boy Jerry, so soon \u2014 soon he was old enough to go to school,\nso he went to kindergarten for \u2014 he went to kindergarten in the regular public\nschool. And then like my wife, she kept her promise and she sent him to\nWestchester Day School for regular schooling. It was a quite a ride from \u2014 I lived\nalready in Yonkers, from Yonkers to Mamaroneck. And they said the only city in\nthe Westchester, they have no transportation. All the other cities, they have\ntransportation from one school to the other one, even private. So we had to get\ntogether people there and we had a school bus, we paid for the school bus. But\nsometime we had to go ourself and pick him up from the school [indecipherable].\nWhen my other boy was ready to go, we send him to the same school over there, to\nWestchester Day School on the - Mamaroneck, and also we did with the third\nboy, we send him to Westchester Day School til they graduated. Ma \u2014 but the third\nboy, when he was about a year old or so, my wife went to work with real estate, she\nbecame a broker. She took the kid with her, wherever she was going, because I did\nnot trust a babysitter. I never went to a movie while the kids were small, I never\ntrust a babysitter, because a boy, you know, they\u2019re a little on the wild side, and I\ndid \u2014 wherever I could entertain myself, I always used to take the kids along with\nme, in general. Matter of fact, there was one day they were playing cowboy that I\nOctober 22, 1997\nwas cowboy and Indian and I was so tired from working the seven days a week and\nI lay down one time in the afternoon. It was a Sunday, cause Sunday we only\nworked eight hours, so I came home and laid down a little bit. What happened, we\nwere playing cowboy and Indian and they cracked their heads on the radiator, we\nhad to go run to the hospital and put them all three stitches on. So that time I, for\nsure I didn\u2019t trust anybody to watch the kids, til they start growing up a little bit.",
        "Q: What did you tell your sons about your parents and \u2014 and your family?",
        "A: Oh, we told them things, you know, make them understand what happened.\nAlso, I did not have to tell them too much because the schools, the Westchester\nDay School, they had classes for this and they explain it to them what happened on\nthe \u2014 it was much easier for me that somebody else told them, because I get very\nemotional to start talking again what happened.",
        "Q: Did they understand why they didn\u2019t have grandparents?",
        "A: Yeah, after they explain it in their schooling, too. They used to ask if\n[indecipherable] my grandparents, where are my grandparents? So they \u2014 they start\nto understand why they don\u2019t have any grandparents, and why we were all alone.\nWith all the family, with all the friends you had, you had to make it on your own,\nwhatever it is. Even the \u2014 where my wife was staying [indecipherable] there was a\nlittle girl that time, she was 16 \u2014 15 years old, and my wife came out to meet me\nOctober 22, 1997\nsomeplace and I says, where are the children? And she says, I left them with the\nlittle girl. You know, I st \u2014I did not go into that affair \u2014 that affair, I went straight\nhome to watch the kids, and I send the girl home. I said, I don\u2019t trust nobody. And I\n\u2014] think it was some kind of a Bar Mitzvah, whatever, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 she made\narrangements, she was so \u2014 she worked so hard to get arrangement to have a\nbabysitter and I didn\u2019t trust them, so I missed that affair, because since they had the\nstitches on in the head, so that time I didn\u2019t trust them at all, til they grow up.",
        "Q: Besides asking about grandparents, what other questions did they ask you?",
        "A: They ask me \u2014 it was very interested, they used to came home and show me their\nreport cards, how good they are doing in school, which they, they were brilliant, all\nof them in school. So they came home with their report card, and they said they got\nstraight As, they got straight fives, whatever. So \u2014 fours \u2014 four were the best, they\nshow me five fours. So he ask me, my older boy Jerry, he says, Dad, four, you\ndon\u2019t say nothing? This the best. I say, you know how many fours I had when I was\nin school? So he say, yeah? You had so many fours? He goes over to his mother. So\nhe says, Mom, Dad had so many four, was he so brilliant in school? She says, no,\nall the four was failing, he failed every subject, he failed in school. Because what\ncan I tell a child from the school when I only made four grades? Four elementary\ngrade school. Matter of fact, I went five because the fifth one I \u2014 I went over the\nOctober 22, 1997\nsecond grade, I went over twice. How could you go in a school when they beat you,\nwhen you have a yellow \u2014 and th-the yellow stars came out that time, so it was very\nhard. But they went to their mother because my wife is more educated, she has \u2014\nwent to school over here, she was younger, and she was very good in Romanian\nschools ca \u2014 too, which I was very bad. So they never came around to ask me\nquestion about school and things like that, they always went to their mother and\nwith books, with all those things, she understood more.",
        "Q: As your sons grew up, did you tell them about your wartime experiences?",
        "A: Yeah, we kept on \u2014 but a lot of time when I start explaining something, says\nyeah, we just had a class about Auschwitz, we just had a class about this, about this\n\u2014 this liberation, about this, whatever happened. So it was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so emotional\nfor me to explain them all those things, but they \u2014 they says to me, I will never\nforget the thing you went through, even I don\u2019t mention it, they said to me. So we\nhave very good relationship and the contact all the time, so \u2014",
        "Q: Did they ask you questions?",
        "A: Yeah, they kept on asking me questions in general, how they took us away, and\nwho was there. I did not want to give them hatreds, you know, we \u2014 the Hungarian\ntook us away, to say the Hungarians did. I did not want to mention any nation in it. I\njust tell them, the thing was Nazi that time, from \u2014 from \u2014 control from the\nOctober 22, 1997\nGermans. And I say, of course there was a lot of col \u2014 colla \u2014 collaborators and\ndifferent kind of nations, so if you want me \u2014 they get together with somebody and\nsay oh maybe you killed my grandparents, they see somebody, so I didn\u2019t want to\nhave this to happen, I want them to find out a lot of thing their way, too.",
        "Q: Was there something that you would have wanted your sons to ask you that they\nnever asked you?",
        "A: Well, they could have asked me more questions about the Holocaust things, but\nthey already know from the schooling, so there was really a \u2014 no a lot of things\nwhich they could have asked me. I wanted to hear it from them they ask me, I\nwanted to get in\u2014 more involved in thing they are involved. But they know it from\nother people, from other places they go. So they know what\u2019s going on, what\nhappened.",
        "Q: If they didn\u2019t ask you the questions that you wanted them to ask, do you think\nthere might be perhaps any other reasons why they didn\u2019t ask you?",
        "A: It could be they didn\u2019t want to hurt me because they know \u2014 they know I\u2019m\ngoing through even now, emotional a lot of time. It\u2019s fi \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 look, it\u2019s \u2014 we are in\n\u201897 now, I got liberated in 1945. I still see what\u2019s going on, I still see everything in\nfront of my eyes. I still run to the windows, a lot of time I look out, I \u2014 did I really\nOctober 22, 1997\nliberated, and I really free? No \u2014 so they know how I felt about it, maybe they\nrestrain themselves in a lot of questions to ask.",
        "Q: After the day school, what kind of education did your \u2014 your sons have?",
        "A: After the day school they finished in Westchester Day School \u2014 first I\u2019m talking\nabout Jerry. He went \u2014 he went \u2014 he wanted to continue with his Jewish education,\nbecause they were very, very good Jewish \u2014 and by the way, Jerry won the\nvaledictoria(ph) in Hebrew, he was so good in that Westchester Day School. So he\nwas making all the speeches in Hebrew that time. And from there he went on to\nYeshiva University, which is in Manhattan in Amsterdam Avenue. So he went in\nto that school and kept on his education in there. And of course, it looks like one\nson follows the other step, and it\u2019s three brothers, and they been raised so close, so\nthe same thing what happened with my other son, he finished the Westchester Day\nSchool and then he went to Yeshiva University. Well my third boy had a couple of\nmore years to finish Westchester Day School. It was very hard to travel out to\nWestchester Day School to pick him up, to bring him back for certain classes they\nhad. So we decided we gonna have to change school for him, to make it a little bit\ncloser to Yeshiva University. This way you pick him up, you pick them up all one\ntime. So there was a school, the [indecipherable] School. So we registered him\nover there, in [indecipherable] and he finished his two year there. He was so\nOctober 22, 1997\nadvanced from Westchester Day School that he always was ahead of the game in\nschool. Til \u2014 in there, there was no transportation at all, so we didn\u2019t have a bus like\nin Westchester Day School. So what happened in the morning? My wife, before\nshe went to the real estate business, she took them to school every day by day for\nyears and years and I picked him up at night, six, seven o\u2019clock, day by day, all the\ntime. This is the way they got their transportation back and forth. That\u2019s not all,\nsometime they had games, they had other thing, and I didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 you\nknow, to hold them back from anything, so we took them back at night, sometimes I\nfall asleep in the car waiting til they get out from the game, and this went on til they\nall finished, and they all finished Yeshiva University school.",
        "Q: During this time, tell me, how was your \u2014 your business, your \u2014 your job world\ndeveloping?",
        "A: Well, I start working in this metal plant, and I was doing very hard work, you\nknow, like \u2014 like a plain labor or things like this. And this boss who hired me, after\nhe says he sees something in me, after a year or so, I was performing very good.\nUsually in that plant what they did is, if you were working a whole \u2014 a whole year\nwithout being out for any good reason, you used to get an award. I always got the\naward because I was never out. And my record was so great. So I didn\u2019t even know\nthis, this guy was an expert in \u2014 they both was an expert in metal. And he \u2014 one\nOctober 22, 1997\ntime he was watching me, I didn\u2019t even see him watching me. I was working\npiecework at that time, you really had to move. So he was watching me, and he\ncame over here, he came \u2014 I was speaking English already, with a Yiddish en \u2014\naccent. So he came over to me, he says, hey listen. I don\u2019t have a section head over\nhere, would you like to take over the section? Maybe 30 people in there. Me? Me? I\ndon\u2019t even speak the language the right way. How you want me to do something\nlike that? I don\u2019t even write, I can\u2019t even spell. He says, we\u2019ll give you a secretary,\nwe'll give you anything you want, just take over the area. He had 30 people in\nthere, I saw a lot of faults in that department, but I only mind my own business, I\ndid what I have to do. But once I was in charge, I shifted 10 people on the spot. I\nsays, I don\u2019t need these 10 people because this guy could do two jobs. Not to do\nsomething which is impossible, because what happened there, they put a line on,\nand when the one guy finished faster, he was standing around and doing nothing. I\nsays, Okay, you finish this and then you take the other area. And things like this, I\nshifted 10 \u2014 about 10 people approximately. And then they saw I was doing so good\nwith this \u2014 with thing, they had a meeting, the bosses had a meeting between them.\nThey said, let\u2019s make him a supervisor. Came around again with the same bosses,\nwith the same stories and I told them with the same stories, but I wasn\u2019t so much\nafraid for the \u2014 for being the supervisor because I had the section head already\nOctober 22, 1997\ntaking. I took over the job of supervisor on the \u2014 fine, of course, you get a hundred\npeople involved. And I was running back and forth and try to run the department.\nAnd I was so success 1n running the department, that we need more machinery.\nOkay, we need more machinery. I get machinery, so there\u2019s a lot of places where\nyou buy those machinery, those kind of things. Called me in, he says, you going to\nDetroit to buy a machine for this. I say, where\u2019s Detroit? What Detroit? So he\nexplained me, and he says, like I was telling you, we get you all the help. You could\ntake somebody with you if you want to, and you going to Detroit to buy the\nmachine. I went to Detroit, come back \u2014 that time, in the 50s, we paid almost a half\na million dollars for a machine, and I was trusted with so much money to buy the\nmachine. And put out the machine, I set up the machine, put \u2014 course, I had to learn\nthe business, I had to stay in Detroit for a week, two weeks, to learn the bi \u2014 to\nlearn the machine, the new type of machines. Put down the machine and business\nstarted booming again, started hiring more people and kept on going all over the\ncountry, I went all over the cun \u2014 Minneapolis, I went all over the country to get\nmachines. Matter of fact, there was another guy, a boss, he was of German descent,\nand that guy used to travel around too. He went to Germany, he bought a machine.\nHe says to me, Bernie, you going to Frankfurt? I says no, I\u2019m not going there. I\nsaid, I don\u2019t want to put my foot down there, I\u2019m not going there. He says okay, this\nOctober 22, 1997\nis part of the business. It\u2019s something you have to do, and if you won\u2019t do it, then\nwe gonna have a problem. So he says, take somebody with you. I took somebody\nwith me, I went to \u2014 to Frankfurt, I went to other places around there to buy the\nmachine, went back to the old places. And when I stepped down in the airport,\nFrankfurt am Main, I saw Nazis over there, you know, I see the \u2014 the picture\ncomes back to me. It was so \u2014 you know, in early 60s, it was something, you know,\nit come back to my mind. So I says to the guy, he was an Italian guy, I says to him,\nI say, listen. I don\u2019t want to touch a fra \u2014 a\u2014a mark, I don\u2019t want to touch anything\nhere. I\u2019m gonna buy something in the store which 1s made in any other country, and\nyou handle the whole thing. I do the negotiation, and you handle the whole thing.\nSo he couldn\u2019t handle it the right way, so I have to step in anyhow, because it would\nbe a problem. So after the meeting was there, and we bought the machines, that\u2019s\nalready came out for over a million dollar machines, came out the machines, so\nfinally they said stick \u2014 there was a Belgian guy at one who lived in Germany, so\nhe says, okay, we going out to eat in Frankfurt. I says, okay, we going out to eat,\nbut I want to tell you something. I only eat kosher. They all got stung because I \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t even know I was Jewish. So the other guy says, I don\u2019t even know\nwhere they have kosher places in here. So they told the secretary, she kept on\nlooking and looking, looking. Finally they find in the synagogue in Frankfurt,\nOctober 22, 1997\nthere was a Hungarian family that immigrated there, Jewish Hungarian. Matter of\nfact, she was from Hungary, he was from Israel. They opened a kosher place in\nthere. So they say, oh, we have a kosher place in there. So we were re \u2014 all went in\nthere and eat. Can you imagine that? Making all those Nazis eat kosher food? And\nwhen we went in there I said, that\u2019s not enough, I want to do something else too. I\nsay, you want wine? I say yes. Which I don\u2019t drink wine, once in a while. Well,\nactually [indecipherable] So, I says okay. So they bring out the best wine from\nFrance. | said no, no, no, no, no. I want wine from Israel, and I want to see the\nkosher mark on there. So they brought kosher wine and I had to make all of Nazis\ndrink kosher wine too, so I should get a little bit revenge of them. So we find out the\ndeal, we made up the deal, everything. Went back a few times there because \u2014 and I\nwent the same thing, the same thing what I said now, I never saw a mark and I\nnever touched a mark. And never bought anything except when I bought in the\nstores, I went in \u2014 I went in with the American dollar to buy, that time. And then\ncame home, we put up all those machines. And from the hundred people, g-grown\nto 250 people. The business was so booming, the whole plant had over a thousand\npeople. Business was so booming that we had to put in a night shift. So I was in\ncharge in day and night on the plant and the machine. Matter of fact, I got up, I\nwent as high as I became a metallurgent(ph) engineer. I know metal, I know it\nOctober 22, 1997\nanyhow, so I didn\u2019t go to school, but I recognize the metal anyhow, and I told them\nif it\u2019s stainless steel, if it\u2019s 1ron, how much iron is in there. So I became the\nmetallurgents(ph) engineer, and we hired people, new people. We hired a lot of\nItalian people because I speak the language and they were very good workers, so I\nwas leaning to the Italian people. And also I never forget what they did for me when\nthey told me Avanti, Avanti. So I never forget, which I have a soft spot for them. I\nwent back a few times to Italy and I have neighbors Italian, I speak to them Italian.\nBut there was one time I couldn\u2019t get any workers. They used to ask me, where you\nget those people? Do you go to the boat? Do you pick them up there? And so I\ncouldn\u2019t get any people, so they were \u2014 that time \u2014 Puerto Rico opened that time,\nand there\u2019s a lot of Puerto Ricans came in. And interviewed them, and of course\nthey didn\u2019t speak a word Engli\u2014 interview them. And before they start speaking\nEnglish, I learned Spanish, because they couldn\u2019t speak the language, so I had to\nlearn Spanish in \u2014 in the job there. So I was \u2014 I had about \u2014 about 250 people,\nmaybe more, in charge day and night of the oldest machinery. And I find I\u2019m\nworking over there 37 year in one place. I was that time in the union, and when they\nmake me all those big \u2014 big \u2014 make me all those proposal, they says, you have to\nstep out of the union, because you cannot be in the union and you cannot be a boss\nin the side. I came home and I told my wife, I said this and this happen, I could\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecame the vice-president in charge of manufacturing, if \u2014 but I cannot be in the\nunion. She says to me, look, you stay where you are. You \u2014 I don\u2019t need a title.\nYou\u2019re doing very good the way it 1s, don\u2019t leave the union. There was a lot of guys\nthat left the union, and it\u2019s true, they \u2014 they lost their jobs. And I was protected from\nthe union. So I was staying in the union. They \u2014 they had no choice, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to leave, so they left me the way it was, and the exemp \u2014 exemption to do\nsomething like this, to work for the boss, and to work for the union. Then is \u2014 the\nplant got bigger and bigger and I retired, and they take over the \u2014 some other people\ntook over the plant, and the plant went downhill, it took about 10 years. I\u2019m retired\nalready 10 years, and they took over the plant and they \u2014 they \u2014 they brought it\ndown and down and down. Finally they sold it, and \u2014 and they moved to Thailand,\nthe whole company moved to Thailand. So they dissolved the pi \u2014 dissolved\neverything over here. People were coming to me. I had some of the former bosses,\nthey begged me to go and restructure the whole thing, I mean, but I was not\ninterested to go back. I was, but my wife did not want me to go back. She says,\nenough is enough, so that\u2019s it.",

        "Q: \u2014 of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Bernard\nPasternak. This is tape three, side A. Can you give me a little insight into \u2014 into\nyour life overall in this country?",
        "A: Oh, I married in 1953. That where you \u2014 that\u2019s where I \u2014 I always wished I\nshould settle down and start living a normal life. Also was looking for the right girl,\nwhich everybody looks for the right man or the right girl, which I could say I find it.\nWe both fit in so much to each other like a pot with a cover. I was very honest all\nthose years, I\u2019m married for so many years. I had my fun in Italy, so I was very,\nvery devoted to the family, and very honest with my wife, on \u2014 pulling on the same\ntrack together, we never stepped out of line. Once you step out of line, you lose\neverything. So we educated \u2014 highly educated our kids. We worked really, really\nthe hardest way we could, we worked seven days a week, that she worked. There\nwas a lot of time she brought the kids home \u2014 when I brought the kids home from\nschool at night \u2014 all day she was working, and when I brought them home at night, I\ntook over and she went to work. She used to come home 10 o\u2019clock a lot of time\nfrom work. And we had to share whatever we had to do. We had to do the best thing\nwe can. We did when they went to the schooling, and we had also, the most\nimportant thing was the friends, with which friend you were going. Sometimes they\nOctober 22, 1997\nwent out with friends and we didn\u2019t like their friends, because their friends, they left\nthe kids with babysitters, 1t didn\u2019t work out. So we didn\u2019t agree with that, and the\nkids, after they finished the Yeshiva University, they decided they want to go to get\nthe profession, so decided he want to go to law. So Jerry started out, the first thing\nhe said he wants to be a lawyer. So my wife says to him, says look, I will support\nyou and your father will support you all means, all the way. But I want to tell you\nsomething, you gonna be a lawyer, I don\u2019t want a shysie(ph) lawyer in my family, I\nwant the best lawyer there is. If you cannot perform as the best lawyer, I don\u2019t want\na lawyer. But thank God he made it, and my wife got her wish, he\u2019s the best lawyer.\nSo my second boy, he came around, I ask him, what you want to do with your life,\nwhat you want to do for the future? So he says, I\u2019m gonna be a \u2014 a manager, some\nkind, industrial managing, things like that. I says to him, look, there are so many\nthing \u2014 so many people doing that kind of job, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna be\nsome kind of a future. But if you want it, I'll [indecipherable]. So then I find out he\nis interested to go in law. So he went into law too. And of course my third one\nfollowed the same step. What I could tell you one thing, that Iam very happy with\ntheir profession, and they\u2019re very established in the \u2014 in their way. By my \u2014 by\nJerry I have two grandchildren, and they\u2019re wonderful children. And my younger\nboy, he \u2014 he live \u2014 Jerry lives in Silver Spring, Maryland. And my younger boy,\nOctober 22, 1997\nwho married before my middle boy, he lives in Livingston, New Jersey. He has a \u2014\nJerry has a boy and a girl, and my younger boy Steven, he has two girls. One girl 1s\nnamed after my mother and my sister, the one I was telling you she died in the\ncamp, Hannah(ph) Esther. My other granddaughter is named through my wife\nfamily. And I wanted to have a name for my father so bad, so my younger son, he\ngave me the whole name, and I called him Moishe Zev. He doesn\u2019t even have an\nEnglish name, just Moishie(ph). That\u2019s the way they call him. He\u2019s also very \u2014 he\nsucceeds very much in his [indecipherable] in his \u2014 my younger one, he opened his\nown practice and [indecipherable] in a law firm. And my middle boy, we \u2014 he just\ngot married in November. He was waiting too long, he couldn\u2019t find what he wants\nto here. So finally he finds somebody, find a wonderful girl, and he married\nNovember 1996. And my \u2014 he \u2014 of course, no grandchildren over there yet. He is\ndoing very good doing the job in \u2014 in the law firm. They are very well established\nthemself, and thank God, they don\u2019t need any help from nobody, because they\u2019re\ndoing in their own. And I could say that I made it, what my aim was, my dream,\neverything came true the way. Of course, like I said, if you married, and you start\npulling different direction, you never make it. Once you stay together and you work\nout your problems together, you make it. I give you an example for myself.",
        "Q: What\u2019s your reaction to this resurgence of interest in the Holocaust?\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: This is one of the greatest thing the younger generation are doing. I am amazed\nto see some people are putting in their life. Like Esther Finder who\u2019s interview\nme, she\u2019s putting in her life in that Holocaust thing. And that\u2019s all \u2014 whenever we\nget together, we ask about family first, the second word is about the Holocaust. And\nI\u2019m delighted. Also, she had a daughter \u2014 she has a daughter, she got \u2014 she wa \u2014 got\nBat Mitzvah. And we just saw the tape, and she made a speech, also mentioned the\nHolocaust. I tell you, even for so many years, we both \u2014 my wife was here too, we\nboth start crying, you know, to see. That\u2019s the third generation. So it\u2019s one of the\ngreatest thing people could do, to keep on passing from one generation to the other\none. And Esther Finder is a very good example, what she\u2019s doing.",

But\nyou have to put a stop to it because somebody else may believe something like this,\nand you have to prove that that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to search the Holocaust, to\nopen more museum, to open more things, to talk more about it and especially in\nOctober 22, 1997\nschool for the younger children, and not to let go.

Matter of fact, I just\nheard from Jewish [indecipherable] that there is some kind of inte-internet, they\nstart sending anti-Semitic things from the internet, one to the other one.

So you had to be independent in \u2014 in general. But once you went\nthrough this Holocaust life, you know, your experience was entirely different. You\n\u2014 you devoted more, because you see the tsoris you could get in if you do\nsomething in \u2014 and the wrong thing. So it \u2014 it influence a lot, and in the other way,\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something which I don\u2019t feel very well now, you know, you remember all\nOctober 22, 1997\nthose thing, it\u2019s tough, cramming you all the corners, you see all those thing.

I believe you, in Judaism, to God and to people.\nYou have to be for both. You don\u2019t have separate from the other, from anybody\nelse, just to be a Jew. You could be a good Jew, and \u2014 and \u2014 and do what you have\nto do not to be separated, that \u2014 dress different, go different, do other thing\ndifferent.

We never thought we gonna be\nfree, because we know we gonna be killed, or \u2014 or \u2014 or get killed. So either way, we\ndidn\u2019t have any hope to be \u2014 to \u2014 to live. And \u2014 and that\u2019s thing 1s still in our mind,\nthat we never gonna be free. I go up a lot of time at night and I look out of the\nOctober 22, 1997\nwindow and take a look where I am, how I am, and a lot of time when I go up, I\ncould bang in the \u2014 it happened one time I broke the glass from the \u2014 from the \u2014\nfrom the window, because I went out there and I knocked on the glass because I\nwanted to look outside, and it was dark, and I didn\u2019t see, and break the window to\nsee if I\u2019m really free, because it just an unbelievable thing that I am free.",
        "Q: I wanted you to \u2014 to back up for just a minute and \u2014 and tell me, during your\ntime \u2014 after the war, but before you came to the United States, in those years, did\nyou follow the Nuremberg trials?",
        "A: If I follow the \u2014",
        "Q: Nuremberg trials.",
        "A: Not too much, because I didn\u2019t know who they trying. Because we had no \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t read no newspapers, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t read because there\nwas not the papers we know how to read. So I just saw [indecipherable] what\u2019s\ngoing on, and then I find out about the big guys. The only trial I was follow very\nclose is Eichmann \u2019s because he was involved with [indecipherable] the Hungarian\nJew. And I was following very good, even they had a movie about it, so I was very\nmuch interested to see what happened, because a lot of thing I did not know what\nthis guy did. So I followed that thing close, which I know what the other things, the\nother one, I just heard about the names.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: Did you think justice was done?",
        "A: Yeah, justice was done, but the problem was, why was he caught so late?",
        "Q: Did you follow the news on the partition vote for Palestine and the birth of the\nstate of Israel\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, I followed it. So we all followed it when I was in Austria and Reidenburg,\nSalzburg, we did follow the whole thing, and due to the fact I am and I was and I\u2019m\ngonna be forever a real Zionist, and it interested me very much, every corner. They\nalso had a lot of film, like \u2014 they had one film like \u201cHill 24 Doesn\u2019t Answer.\u201d So I\nwas watching that movie a few time, matter of fact, I didn\u2019t even go out to see. And\nI \u2014 when I was with family there in Israel, they show me around the area, I ask\nthem where the fights was. I also, when we went for Tel Aviv with family to\nJerusalem, they [indecipherable] back and forth and they show me all the places\nwhere the Jordanian used to hide. And they shu \u2014 shoot down the thing. So I know\nIsrael very well, and I know every corner because I been there at least 20 times. So\nwe go very often there and \u2014 and our hearts, me and my wife is Israel and Israel\nagain. And it\u2019s one of the greatest things because I think Jewish people will never\nexist in this country without Israel and Israel will never exist without the American\nJewish. So it\u2019s something like one people, and we have to stick it together,\notherwise we will never survive.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "Q: What has been the \u2014 either the best surprise, or the biggest disappointment that\nyou had in this country?",
        "A: Well, dis-dis-disappointment is when I came to this country, and it wasn\u2019t so\nrosy in the beginning and it was a very hard life to start, you know, without\nspeaking the language. It \u2014 it \u2014 1t was a terrible thing, which I kept on saying I want\nto go back to Italy. I speak the language there and I had a job with the government,\nItalian government. And there was a disappointing \u2014 soon I walked down the boat, I\nwas disappointed in my aunt, she didn\u2019t tell us the true, I would have be in Israel\nnow, where I belong; in the army someplace, being a general, who knows? And so\nit didn\u2019t work out with that, was a very big disappointment. What I am very surprise\nand very happy, I could tell you I succeeded. In this country I did made it, in\ngeneral, for one reason; because we pulled in the same direction with my wife. We\nmarried from 1953, and now is 1997. And of course everybody has a little quarrel\nback and forth, and I always back up, because I know she\u2019s right. So I always have\nthe last word, I say, okay, what do you want me to do? But she\u2019s a great lady in\ngeneral, and also she don\u2019t feel too good now, she has \u2014 arthritis developed in the \u2014\nin the camps. She doesn\u2019t feel good, a lot of problems she has, and she\u2019s talking to\nme, she says, you got \u2014 now you \u2014 look what you \u2014 you have yourself now, look\nwhat a wife you have. I can\u2019t help you too much, I can\u2019t do too much because I\nOctober 22, 1997\ndon\u2019t feel good. My only reply was, I don\u2019t see you the way you look now, I only\nsee you the way I met you, and to my eyes 1s the way I know you and the way\nyou\u2019re gonna stay. So you know what she said to me? Why don\u2019t you get \u2014 change\nyour glasses? That was the reply. Which I wear no glasses anyhow.",
        "Q: What would you yet like to accomplish?",
        "A: I\u2014 what I like to accomplish, I\u2019m accomplishing. Traveling from one son to the\nother one, going to Israel and make sure my wife feels good, make sure I could do\neverything to help her, because bothers her, a lot of thing. And whatever I do now,\nI\u2019m very happy in general, and my happiest \u2014 second happiest thing 1s \u2014 was the\ngrandchildren, the family, and then when we go to Israel. Like I said, we go every\nyear, and we see so many friends over there. And I\u2019m just delighted to see the way\nthe country is growing and \u2014 and they cannot say now like they used to say, in\nRomania used to say, hey Jew, go to Palestine; hey Jew, you don\u2019t belong here.\nNow we are there where we belong.",
        "Q: What would you like your sons and \u2014 and grandchildren to know about you that\nthey perhaps don\u2019t know about you?",
        "A: Well, I only want them to know the way we are and I don\u2019t want them to think\nthat I came from the big family, you know, very important people. I came from a \u2014\nfrom where I came. Came from a \u2014 we were very poor, it was a very poor place\n100October 22, 1997\nfrom where I came, I want them to know that. I also want them to know the\nhardship I went through, and I want them to know that my success, they should take\na example from me, why \u2014 why you success in life. And you stick \u2014 when you want\nto do something you stick to it, and help each other and I want to see close family,\nlike Iam with my sister and my brother now. To me the \u2014 this is the most important\nthing, cousins, whatever it 1s, just stay close, get in contact with each other, call\neach other. And that makes my life.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about a book that recently came to our attention, both of us.\nThe book 1s entitled, \u201cPrisoner 83571.\u201d Can you tell me a little bit about this book,\nand what it has meant to you?",
        "A: This book, what you just mentioned, it\u2019s very, very interested to me. Why? He\u2019s\ntelling the story exactly what happened. And it \u2014 very interested that this man went\nthrough the same thing that I went through, and by reading all this thing of what he\nwent through, I remember a lot of things. One thing, I was working ina\u2014ina-\u2014ina\nmine on \u2014 on a stone mine, we were working in the mountains there, and I didn\u2019t\nknow what the heck they were doing there, the German. In the book I see they were\ntrying missiles there. The German were trying the missile, the V-2, whatever they\nmake. And there was other thing. A lot of marsh \u2014 marches we went, and we didn\u2019t\nhave any direction. So he says in the book, we \u2014 we marched a death march to\n101October 22, 1997\nnowhere. I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] we were going there. And there was a lot\nof areas I didn\u2019t know the distance from one place to the other one, he\u2019s telling me\nwhere. It\u2019s something I keep on reading and reading, keep on reminding. It\u2019s one of\nthe greatest book a man could ever write, especially the \u2014 the thing which I went\nthrough.",
        "Q: Are you saying that you were in the same camp as this \u2014 this author?",
        "A: Yes, I was in the same camp from the beginning. First of all, he\u2019s starting up\nwith his life in Poland someplace where he was before they send him to\nAuschwitz. And from there where he picks up the Auschwitz til the liberation, it \u2014\nit\u2019s exactly what I went through, because he was in the same camp. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\nreminds me the thing, a lot of thing, which I couldn\u2019t remember. Like I was\nworking when they had that mine working in there, in the mountains in there. And I\nwas working for somebody there, for a German guy, a civilian guy, I didn\u2019t know\nhis name. He puts 1t down in the book, what the guy\u2019s name was and it was very\ninteresting to me to see it, which I have a copy and I treasure it very much.",
        "Q: Is there anything you\u2019d like to add? Something that perhaps we didn\u2019t cover, that\nyou would like to include before we finish?",
        "A: Well, it was very hard for me to give this interview, because it takes me back,\nway back what happened. It\u2019s not gonna be easy for me to forget all those thing,\n102\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecause sometime it takes months to get over this thing, because it brings you back\na lot of memories, which \u2014 what happened, and you get so confused now, after you\nfinish. There\u2019s a lot of thing I really forgot. I didn\u2019t cover everything what I wanted\nto say, because there\u2019s a lot of thing I forgot. So whatever I remembered, I said it,\nand I hope this thing will go out to schools and to other places. They should hear\nwhat happened, and they learn from it. And maybe if there is any problem like the\nskinheads or the other thing, then those kids will say no, no, I heard it from a\nsurvivor and I don\u2019t believe what you say, because it\u2019s not so, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really the\ntruth that the Holocaust existed, which we all know that.",

        "Answer: Well, have to give me a couple of seconds, to turn the clock back, to tell\nyou about it. The first thing on the liberation, I noticed a lot of noise and I didn\u2019t\nknow from where the noise is coming. Then I heard people are saying the\nAmericans are here, the Americans are here. But some people who were saying the\nAmericans are here, they were from far away the noise, because inside on the camp\nthere was still SS, try to get people up, to keep on going for the death march, keep\non going. So I could not go any more because of wa \u2014 was very weak. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe have 60 or 65 pounds. So what I did, I saw bodies, dead bodies laying there,\nand I figure I\u2019m gonna go between the dead bodies, in the middle there and I had a\nweak spot on my nose, which all \u2014 blood always comed \u2014 it came out. So what I\nOctober 22, 1997\ndid, whatever what I had, I hit my nose, and I fulled it out with blood, and my\nmouth was full of blood when the Nazis came around to try to drag the people out.\nSo first of all, the people who did not want to get up, they shot them on the pla \u2014\nthey killed them. So when they came to me and they saw that I still have a little life\nin it, so the other guy says, don\u2019t waste your bullets [indecipherable]. So they kept\non going. And then a little bit later, the Americans liberated, but they did not come\nin the camp. That was all on the outside. The thing were t \u2014 when I got up already,\nhow did I get out there? There was a lot of other people who were a little stronger,\nand they went around the camp and they start running, and they start saying, we are\nliberated, we are liberated, you could get up. Whoever lays down there who could\nget up, get up because we are liberate from the Americans. I never know just how\nthe system works in \u2014 in the army, because I never was in the army. The first thing\nwhen I got up, I went outside a little bit, I saw the American soldiers in there, and I\nwas told that\u2019s General Patton over there. I said, who\u2019s Patton? I never know this \u2014\nthose kind of names, because we never heard it. And then later on I find out all\nwhatever happened, how he came there and what he came there. And suddenly a\nfew soldiers came out, American soldier, and they start talking Yiddish me. They\nsay, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, who else is here? I said, they all Jew, all\naround me, they all Jewish people over here. Then he start talking, and the first\nOctober 22, 1997\nthing they tried [indecipherable] chocolate, chewing gum, they tried\n[indecipherable] the thing was interesting, the chewing gum, I took a lot of\npackages in, but they \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 til it was sweet. And when it wasn\u2019t more sweet, I\nswallow it. Then I got sick, because I didn\u2019t know. And then the guy \u2014 one guy\ncame over to me, another guy, he says to me in \u2014 in Yiddish, he says, you don\u2019t eat\nthat, he says, that\u2019s [indecipherable] only chew it on the mouth. I said, I never saw\nsomething like this in my life. And nobody said it, so there was other guys who got\nsick from it. I must \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many packages I ate up on the time. And\nthen we \u2014 we were \u2014 we get up a little bit and \u2014 and then more problems started in\nthe camp.",
        "A: The camp I was liberated was Buchenwald. I was, I think in 63\u2122 block, 63 \u2014 30\n\u2014 something, I think that was the block, I was there. So \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014it was in April some time, I think. I really don\u2019t have the date. I have it\nmarked down someplace, but in April sometimes, it was the liberation. Then it \u2014 it\narrived the problem was what happened after. We were all \u2014 of course, we didn\u2019t\neat for so long, and we were all hungry. And what was the bi \u2014 the biggest mistake,\nOctober 22, 1997\nwhat happen. They brought in all the food the SS ha-had accumulated for\nthemselves, and they brought it all in the camp, and we went there, you know, like \u2014\nlike \u2014 like hungry people, and we start eating and then the problem \u2014 nobody told us\ndon\u2019t eat because the stomach is smaller. And we all sick, so we start eating and\nmost of them died right in the sprot \u2014 in the spot in front of me. I got a flat typhus,\nand I was too \u2014 took right away to the hospital, and you know who treated me? A\nNazi doctor, where he still had the SS sign on him, and he treated me\n[indecipherable]. So they pumped the stomach and I had a headache after that for\nyears and years I couldn\u2019t get rid of that headache, that finally it went off \u2014 in\naccount of that flat typhus.",
        "A: Well, you know, you are so weak, and in general and you\u2019re really the merak \u2014\nyou are \u2014 you are sick all over, I mean, it\u2019s something which I could say, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\nmiracle thing which people survived after that, because we all were by all miracle,\nyou know, by all \u2014 how shall I say \u2014 medicine would not help us the way we were\nlooking. No \u2014 nothing would have help it, just miracle thing, and \u2014 and that\u2019s what\nhappened is the way we pulled through. Also, you pull through is the will \u2014 the will\n\u2014 the willpower to live, and that\u2019s the way it kept us going. We were a few people\ntogether there and we stick together til things got a little bit better. And then doctors\nOctober 22, 1997\ncame in. Al-All a prisoner of war doctor, all German \u2014 German doctors came 1n, in\nthe \u2014 although we went to the hospital there. We didn\u2019t leave the camp for awhile,\nbut later on we took [indecipherable] part of camps, and we went in in the German\nand the SS barracks, and there start to get a little bit better in general.",
        "A: That \u2014 that hospital actually was a hospital for the SS people. And due to the fact\nthere was a lot of prisoner of war who were Germans, they kept on running the\nsame hospital, the same thing 1-it was, except in \u2014 as \u2014 how shall I say? Instead\ntreating the Germans, they treated us. The hospital was overflowed and it kept on\n[indecipherable] more and more places and bringing more and more doctors to try\nto see \u2014 to cure us a little better. And all the medicine already the \u2014 the American\nprovided all this necessary thing for the people to survive. Also, like I was mention\nbefore, the willpower to live, we had a lot of encouragement from the American \u2014\nfor the soldier, from the Jewish soldiers, who told us \u2014 they were speaking, so\ninterested. I wa \u2014 I had a eastern European accent, you know, and when they were\ntalking, you know, I c \u2014 I couldn\u2019t understand. First I \u2014 I thought they \u2014 what kind\nof Yiddish they are talking to me? And then I got used to it and they told me, oh, I\nOctober 22, 1997\nwas born in America already and my grandparents came here, but it was interesting\nthey were still speaking the Yiddish language, which it had a lot to do with our\nsurvival, I think.",
        "A: We were told in the camps that it doesn\u2019t matter. If you live, they gonna kill you,\nand if you die, you die.",
        "A: We were \u2014 we were talking between us in the camp. He says, there is no way\nout, because they not gonna let you live after \u2014 because we saw what happened\nalready to the \u2014 the people who were weak, they took them to work and then they\nkilled them. And we said between us, as long we could work, maybe they gonna\nkeep us alive. Once we cannot work, th-they not gonna let us go free, they gonna\nkill it. So actually to say \u2014 to find out in the end we are free, it just a \u2014 so many\nyears passed and I still can\u2019t believe it I\u2019m free, I\u2019m out of that thing. Because I still\ncould see that it happen like yesterday. It\u2019s not \u2014 so many years, so many \u2014 50\nyears. I think it happened yesterday. I could see everything in front of my eyes,\nwhat happened, right now, what \u2014 anything, any \u2014 any little details.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a ver \u2014 very interested. First of all, when we got liberated, who \u2014\nwho was a little strong, they caught some of the guards. What they did to those\nguards, even me, I had such a hatred against what they did to me, I couldn\u2019t stand it,\nI couldn\u2019t see. They pulled their finger out. They took pliers and they pulled their\nfinger out. The \u2014 they \u2014 they took a knife and they took their eyes out in front one of\nthe other one. And when one got tired, another guy took over. And \u2014 and what they\ndid to those people, I\u2019m sure they never [indecipherable]. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nwitness something like this, some \u2014 because one human being to do \u2014 to do to the\nother one, I \u2014 I \u2014 I said to the old guys around, I says the \u2014 I think the lord should\ntake on that, I saying we shouldn\u2019t take any retaliation something like this. Even\nwhat they did to us, you have to have a heart, you know, to do something like this. I\nalso heard that soon the camp was surrendered, Buchwald was surrendered, they\ncaught some guards and they put them to the wall \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I di \u2014 I think it \u2014 I\nwas told from the allied soldiers, I \u2014 I cannot \u2014 I\u2014 I can\u2019t poi \u2014 point a figure which\nallied soldier \u2014 and they shot about a hundred, 150 people. They put them to the\nwall \u2014 first they show them the brutality that they did, and then they killed them. I\nOctober 22, 1997\nthink you\u2019re better off to be killed than to \u2014 to do something like this, take eyes out,\npull finger out or something like that. I\u2014 I couldn\u2019t witness something like this, but\nthey \u2014 they kept on doing it. Most of them was the f \u2014 French soldiers, they were\nimprisoned, they brought them in prison, you know, they brought them to the camp,\njust a little bit before the liberation. They were really strong, and they did the job for\nthis thing.",
        "A: Ihave a\u2014a-\u2014a picture here of one inmate, the way he looked after the liberation,\nbeyond medical \u2014 you know, beyond medical thing. If you would have given any\nkind of medicine, you could not survive. And well, you were young, you know\nwhat, 20 years, 19 years old, you know, the willpower was there. You try to take\ncare of yourself wherever you can, and \u2014 and now it-1t\u2019s something which you \u2014 you\nsurvived, which it \u2014 like I said, it\u2019s a miracle thing, whoever survived, whoever\ncame out alive from \u2014 from those camps.",
        "A: Well, you know, even \u2014 even you went to hell like this, and when you are so\nyoung, you are in the teens you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something, you know, it doesn\u2019t a-\naffect that much, the thing which it happened by the older people, which they \u2014 they\ndied right on the spot. They \u2014 even the hospital, they died. Of course, in the later\nage, it comes out a little bit. I have other problems now, which you know, it\u2019s\nrelated to the camps, an-and even now during the night a lot of time, I see the SS in\n\u2014 marching by, and \u2014 and Ill wake up with a sweat. ll go to the window and I see,\noh, I\u2019m liberated. It\u2019s just an unbelievable thing, even now that I\u2019m liberated.",
        "A: The living condition wasn\u2019t bad because the American provided everything.\nThey brought in everything. They brought it in with the truckl \u2014 truckloads. But I\nwas hoping that somebody will be there and tell us, don\u2019t touch this, don\u2019t touch\nthis, because our stomach couldn\u2019t take it and you just keep on throwing so much\nfood in there and \u2014 matter of fact, I \u2014 the first thing what I did, there was a box of \u2014\nof cookies, and I finished the whole box of cookies. I got sick from that too, and\nOctober 22, 1997\nthen one SS guy says to me, who \u2014 one SS doctor says to me, you understand any\nEnglish, American? I says no. The only one thing I heard the Americans saying,\nokay. That\u2019s the only on \u2014 word I could understand. He says, you know what you\nare eating? I says no. He says, you are eating dog biscuits, and that\u2019s why you are \u2014\ngot sick. I says, what about the \u2014 in the camps, the \u2014 the meat tasted so good. He\nsays, that was dog meat what you are eating, and that\u2019s what you got sick. They\nhave to put you back in the hospital for that da \u2014 so, matter of fact, I went in and out\nin the hospital for all kind of thing, any little thing. And \u2014 and then they had a big\ncelebration in the camp for liberation. And they had so much food in there, and got\nsick again. You know, you keep on eating and eating, you try to full yourself up and\n\u2014 and that was the wrong thing to do, but nobody said, and we were too naive to\nunderstand the whole thing, so \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 I had some people over there, some \u2014 just some friends, they were\ncoming from the same town, the area, but I didn\u2019t see them after this. The reason,\non the camp, and \u2014 in Buchenwald on the camp, and that s \u2014 it was some kind of a\nlibrary, at \u2014 but the SS library. On that library walls, they put down names \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow who put on the names, how they got the names, they put on names who\nOctober 22, 1997\nsurvive in other camps. So I looked around there and I saw my te \u2014 my sisters in \u2014\nin another camp not far from Suico(ph). Now how do you get to Suico(ph) from\nBuchenwald, the one place, the other one? Then I find out that\u2019s the bus is running\nfrom one town to the other one, I had another friend who finds somebody there, and\nI hop myself on the bus, but 1t wasn\u2019t easy, the bus \u2014 the bus was so fulled up\ninside, there was no room whatsoever. So we went on top of \u2014 on the bus, on the\nroof, and we laid down there. It was in \u2014 in July or August, it was \u2014 1t was really so\nchilly, the weather was so chilly, was so cold, and we didn\u2019t have the proper\nclothing, but we were in the \u2014 1n top of the bus almost all night, a day and a night\nsomething it took. What did we eat? There was some food around. Those people\nwho were in the \u2014 in the \u2014 they were mostly of the Germans \u2014 German people, not\nany others, so they had some food, and they shared some of us until we arrived in\nthe place and destination where we wanted to be. When we arrived in the place, I\nfind there \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of this town, but I know it was Suico(ph),\nou-outskirt of Suico(ph). It\u2019s Sachsen in Germany. So when we arrived over there,\nI went to look up, I went to the Biirgermeister and I wanted to find out if there is\nsuch a such people, where they are, because they were all registered. What they did\nthere, they \u2014 also the American made the people to take in the refugees in \u2014 in\ncivilian homes. So, due to the fact everybody was registered in town where they are,\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecause they had to provide food for them. So he told me yes, there is \u2014 over there\nand there, there is three Pasternaks. There was my oldest sister Rose, younger\nsister Raechel(ph), and there was another sister, Gitel. So I ask [indecipherable]\nthey said she died in the camp of \u2014 of-of typhus, something. So she died Hanukkah\ntime, so \u2014 and then we were all together 1n that time, and we were there for a little,\nshort time.",
        "A: When we got the reunion, the first thing was of \u2014 if \u2014 to find our father, because\nwe know he was strong guy, and we know he could survive. We didn\u2019t talk about\nour mother and another sister, because we know they went straight to the\ncrematorium because my mother was sick, and with the little sister. That\u2019s the first\nquestion, we tried to figure out a way. And then I had another brother, and I wanted\nto find him. His no \u2014 his name was Azreal(ph), so we wanted to find him, so we\ndidn\u2019t know where to start looking. And we were in that camp a little while, and I\nwanted \u2014 and \u2014 and it was \u2014 it \u2014 it really was some kind of a barracks too, after \u2014\nafter \u2014 when we went out from the civilian, we went in a little barrack because we\nwere ready to be \u2014 to go back into Germany. It\u2019s the reason it \u2014 because that time\nthe allies, they made some agreement with the Russians, that the Russians gonna\nOctober 22, 1997\ncome over to Suico(ph) and they gonna divide something [indecipherable] I heard\nsomething or \u2014 and \u2014 and that means, the next day, we will be in Russian zone, not\nin the American zone. It was very interest at that time, we didn\u2019t want to move from\nthere because we wanted really to go straight home to find out who else is alive, and\nwho else we could get reunited. So there was again, soldiers, American soldiers. I \u2014\nI don\u2019t know their rank, and they say okay, let\u2019s back up \u2014 in Yiddish, he say let\u2019s\nback up and \u2014 and go. We going \u2014 we going in to Germany, we going to\nFrankfurt. I say why? I have it so good over here, for now. I\u2019m gonna ma \u2014 we\ngonna make all the arrangement, and \u2014 and we gonna go back for my\n[indecipherable] which it was Transylvania, Mamurish(ph) and Oybarishu(ph),\nhe called it a different name [indecipherable] Yiddish they called it Visho(ph). So I\nwanted \u2014 so the \u2014 the \u2014 the f \u2014 captain, whatever he was, he had \u2014 he had some stars\non the time, was to be a captain. He says to me, you know, you people making a\nmistake. You just got liberated, and you gonna stay here. You know who\u2019s \u2014 who\u2019s\ngonna take you over? The Russians. I say look, when we were kids, they told us the\nlife in Russia is so good, he say, you only work and you get everything for nothing.\nSo, you would have no pro \u2014 I mean, we would have no problem, I says, nothing\u2019s\nwrong with \u2014 with them \u2014 to stay over there and to wait for them. He says, don\u2019t tell\nme \u2014 don\u2019t say it I didn\u2019t tell you, I didn\u2019t warn you. He say goodbye. The next day,\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe Russian came in and they \u2014 first of all, that ca \u2014 that barracks over there mus \u2014\nwas only women. | think me and my friend was the only man, well a \u2014 maybe \u2014 I\nwould say over a hundred girls [inaudible]. Soon that guy comes in and from us \u2014\nthere was people from Czechoslovakia, there \u2014 Jewish people from there, and they\nspeak the language, the Russian language. The first thing the Russian came in they\nsaid, if you people don\u2019t behave, we send you to Siberia. That guy who told \u2014\ntalked to us about the \u2014 th-this way, he had a couple of spoon in his boots, dirty all\naround. I couldn\u2019t figure out, I says to friends there, I says, that\u2019s the Russian?\nThat\u2019s what they told it to so good, and all the good thing it\u2019s in there? And he said,\nthat\u2019s the Russian. Now, we had to be very careful not to say anything because th-\nthey were drunk, right away they were drunk. I saw guys, they had two, three\nwatches in th \u2014 in their hand, taking them from other people. So we \u2014 now we were\n\u2014now we had a problem, tried to \u2014 we should get back to the American zone, but\nwe could not do it. So what we did, we made the arrangement, like I said before,\nand we went back to Romania. It wasn\u2019t such an easy trip to go back. First of all,\nwe had to get out from Germany, we went into Czechoslovakia, to Prague. We\nalso went with the train. And this was all Russian controlled zone. Those people\nacted like wild animals, like you see the wild kingdom of the animals. What di \u2014\nwhat did they do? First of all, I saw right away that I am dealing with the devil. So,\nOctober 22, 1997\nI removed \u2014 I was in \u2014 on one car, one boxcar, I was with some girls, with the girls,\nlike I was saying there was girls. So I says to my sister, first thing I gotta do, I gotta\nremove the locks. I took the locks off on both side, they should not be able to come\nin. They were banging all night to come in and to try and rob the people, rape the\npeople, whatever they did. The next day after the night, we \u2014 we got to a station, we\ngot some water there. It was in Czechoslovakia. What happened, I find out what\nthe Russian dids. They were acting unhuman to those girl, the skeletons girl, they\nwere acting. They \u2014 even they had something like a watch or something, they took\neverything from them away. They were riding also on top of the \u2014 on that \u2014 on the\ntrain, and the bridges were low over there, most of them got killed on the spot there,\nbecause they were \u2014 they were drunk and standing up there, and they falled off. So\nfrom there, after I saw right away the situation again, so the girls come over to me,\nthey say, you saved our lives. I was there with my other friend in there, he says you\nsaved our lives because you \u2014 smart thing to do is to remove the locks, they\nshouldn\u2019t be able to come in. And then we arrived in \u2014 in Prague, we were there a\nfew days, it to \u2014 it took quite awhile to get for the train there to Prague. And in\nPrague we were a few days. There was already, I think the Jewish organizations;\nthe first time I saw Jewish organizations try to talk us and try to help us go further.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: The \u2014 the Joint. That time was the Joint. So they were a \u2014 also I saw \u2014 I was very\nsurprise to see also people of the Jewish organizations from South Africa. Of\ncourse, I learned about South Africa [indecipherable]. There was a woman\nsoldiers, Jewish girls, women soldiers, speaking Yiddish 1n such a funny accent, I\nnever \u2014 never heard something \u2014 I couldn\u2019t figure out \u2014 even I understand, which I\n\u2014I didn\u2019t speak any English, I couldn\u2019t understand the way they were talking. But\nm \u2014 the products \u2014 1-1t\u2019s too \u2014 it was the Joint, but most of the [indecipherable] it \u2014\nit was written on the can, I\u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m a tuna, you know, a gift from the South African\nJews, Johannesburg. I could see the label in \u2014 in front of my eye, there was\nwritten. And they made us very comfortable over there and they tried to get us\nfurther dow \u2014 further to \u2014 to get to our desin \u2014 destination. So from Prague we took\nanother train, of course. Some people \u2014 not with the same people, some people, they\nwent on different direction. We went into Budapest. We sto \u2014 in Budapest I had\nvery little problem, because Czech, I didn\u2019t speak that language, but in Hungary I\nspeak the language, so we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we had very little problem. Also there was\nalso the Jewish organization like the Joint. I didn\u2019t see the South Africans there,\nthere was only the Joint, the American. And they took over a place, they call it\nAdjibat(ph) school. There was a school there and the name was Adjibat(ph) and\nthey \u2014 there was a lot of food already, kitchens over there, setting up. But you\nOctober 22, 1997\ncouldn\u2019t go out on the street because they were looking for Nazis, the \u2014 the\nRussians were looking for Nazis so they had the Hungarians with the \u2014 going\naround with them. And the \u2014 and they know right away, there\u2019s not the \u2014 don\u2019t look\nHungarian because the way you walk, the way you eat, the way the thing, right\naway they point it out from you. So the Russians gave in the documents that we are\nre-refugees in Budapest. We also got documents in Prague, which I have them\nright here. And the reason I| kept all those documents from wherever I went, they\ngave us a paper and I kept it. I also got the papers from the liberation from\nBuchenwald from the U.S. Army, which I have it here in my possession. For all\nthose year, I carried that. So in Budapest, I went out in the street, I felt like home,\nyou know, we went out, we took a walk. I find one guy which e \u2014 he was our\nneighbor, and he was in the Czech army that time. And we walked, we kept on\ntalking, we walk in the street there and finally we saw one guy \u2014 two \u2014 two people,\nnot one, but one guy we recognized. I said, is it the chief of the police of our town?\nYou know what this guy did with him in my \u2014 thi \u2014 this person who I \u2014 I know from\nhome? He \u2014 first he beat the hell out of him, and the Russians came around, there\nwa a lot of soldiers, they came around and they seen what\u2019s going on, they didn\u2019t\nintervene at all, til the guy got ready, and then he s \u2014 he says to the Russian, he said,\nthis is the guy, when we were in the ghetto in the \u2014 and boxcars used to come in\nOctober 22, 1997\nwith potatoes or other kind of food for the ghetto, so this guy took away all the\nfood, he gave it to the local people and to us, when it \u2014 in the bottom on the train\nthere was dirt, he said, this is for the Jew. And then this fellow, the Jewish guy, he\npicked up the \u2014 the Czech soldier and he pu \u2014 picked up a lot of dirt from the floor\nand he fulled up his mouth, he says, this is the dirt what you told us to eat, now you\neat the dirt. And after a few days, we decided we are going to see whoever\u2019s alive.\nIt\u2019s about five an \u2014 500 kilometer from Budapest to our destination. When we got \u2014\nit was easy to get, you know, the \u2014 the traveling that I \u2014 the trains used to go maybe\n20 miles an hour, the whole train, even the \u2014 it was written 1n the car they go 40\nmile, they only go about 20 mile. Sometime you could run faster than the trains, the\nway they had those trains. And we got home to our destin \u2014 destination, the\nOybarishu(ph) Mamurish(ph). We came home, and of course the \u2014 it was a very\ninteresting place. First of all, on the da \u2014 this place, before th-they call it Rishu(ph),\nit was Austria-Hungary before the first World War. On the fir \u2014 on the W-World\nWar first after, they \u2014 the Romanian took it over. In 1940, the Hungarians took it\nover. So we were shoved to one \u2014 from one to the other one. When the Hungarians\nwent \u2014 when it was Austro-Hungary, that wasn\u2019t a bad place to live, and to \u2014 it\nwas pretty good over there, because there was a lot of wood, and the Hungarians,\nthe Austrian didn\u2019t have so much wood, the tree, so it was not a bad life. But when\nOctober 22, 1997\nthe Romanian came in, and the Romanian had a lot of wood, so life got deteriorated,\nit was \u2014 it was such a good, I mean, people were suffering a lot. And when we\narrived in the \u2014 on the \u2014 1n the town and the city, manufactured was\n[indecipherable] city with \u2014 of three \u2014 4,000 Jews in there before the war. When\nwe arrived there, we find a couple of Jewish families in there and we tried to see\nhow we could do something, and tried to build up our lives \u2014 put together the life.\nBut we really couldn\u2019t make it out. We try all kinds of business, we\u2019re trying to\nbring in store from one \u2014 from one place to the other one, tra \u2014 traveling to the\ntowns, things like this, and the bottom line, we couldn\u2019t make out.",
        "A: We - we really \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too bad even before we le \u2014 we got along with the\nRomanians pretty good. It was a city from Romanians, Hungarians, Germans. We\nhad our own, you know, like neighborhoods. This was a German neighborhood,\nthere was Hungarian. But really 1-1t wasn\u2019t that bad before the war with those\npeople, we got along pretty good. But th-the \u2014 the thing is, with the Germans it was\nanother \u2014 another ball game that time because they \u2014 they went \u2014 they called it\n[indecipherable] they all went to the German army, they all went to the SS army.\nAnd of course, that was not, you know, good cooperation with them. So when I was\nOctober 22, 1997\n\u2014 we \u2014 when we were in Viseu, so our first thing, we find our brother in there. He\nwas in the Hungarian army as a laborist. And we find him over there already, but\nwe couldn\u2019t make ends meet over there. So I was there with my \u2014 my brother\nAzreal(ph), and I was there with my sister Rose and Raechel(ph) and Gitel. But the\nmost interested thing, my sister was married before the war, and my brother-in-law\ncame back and they got reunited again in Viseu in the same town. So \u2014 but there\nwas no more futures because I saw a different type of life after, whenever you travel\none city to the other one, and the life in \u2014 in the town was so backwards. So there\nwas really nothing more we could do. So we made preparation. We tried to sell\nthing, but to who you gonna sell? Because when we came home, most of the houses\nwas robbed. They took everything away, the local people. Even we got along with\nthem nice, but they still, you know, they still tried to get something for nothing and\nthey came down \u2014 they used to live out of town, they came down in the town, they\noccupied all the Jewish houses in there, and it was no life whatsoever. So our mind\nwas just to get out of there, and to see what we could start up new.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: We - we ex \u2014 first of all, we were talking about the \u2014 our father to see if we\ncould find him to find out what it is. And that was in the top of the agenda, to find\nout if he\u2019s alive, because we know he \u2014 he could survive because he was strong\nfellow and so the thing is this, we find some other people who came in in town, and\nthey told us we should not expect the father, because he had \u2014 he was in\nTheresienstadt for specialty reason and they bombed the camp, and he was\nworking there as a veteran doctor with a friend of his, and he didn\u2019t go to work that\nday, he was taking care of the German horses, and the allies bombed the camp, and\ndestroyed the camp, and they killed them, the f-f\u2014 the first day of Chol HaMoed\nPesach, and that\u2019s when we keep the Yahrzeit because we know exactly when he\ngot killed.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, there \u2014 some more people came in 1n our town, and the city, they came\nhome and we tried to find out if the \u2014 1f \u2014 1f maybe they could find out where my\nfather was. We didn\u2019t know he was in Theresienstadt, we had \u2014 couldn\u2019t find out\nwhat camp. Then there was a barber, he was a avrum(ph) de barbera(ph) they\ncalled in town. He was a very good friend my father, and then he told us the tragedy\nwhat happened. My father knows horses, and he had a friend, he was working in a\ndrugstore, and due to the fact there was a very good combination, and the Germans\ngive him the job taking care of their horses. And then the next day or so, that time it\nwas very big bombardment, they wiped out the camp, right, and my father and his\nfriend Drogas(ph), th-they both got killed. And it was the first day of Chol\nHaMoed Pesach, and that\u2019s the day we are keeping the Yahrzeit, because we\nknow exactly what the day and \u2014 and the Yahrzeit for my mother, my sister, we\nkeep the first day of when we arrived in Auschwitz, that was [indecipherable].\nAnd we \u2014 it\u2019s actually picked a day, because we don\u2019t know exactly when they went\nto the crematorium, but according to the rabbi, they told us that when you arrived,\nthat\u2019s the day that you gotta keep the Yahrzeit. But therein \u2014 then, after we find out\nabout our father, so there were no more hope in there, and no more thing, so try to\ngo back from where we came, to Germany, to the American zone, we know we\nhave family in the United States and other family in other areas. So we tried to go\nOctober 22, 1997\nback because we already heard that they have there DP camps they opened in\nAustria and Germany and other places. So we go in in that camp and from there\nprobably we\u2019ll be able to go into our \u2014 another country because we have nothing to\ndo any more in here, it\u2019s all washed out. Now, going back wasn\u2019t so easy, it was\nvery hard to go back. First of all, we had to have money to travel, you couldn\u2019t do\nit. We had a few things, but we hardly got anything for it. So we start traveling, we\nwent back to one city, they call it [indecipherable]. We went over there with the\ntrain. From there we had to go in on the \u2014 to the Czechoslovakia side again, in the\nAllneek(ph) Javorkt(ph) mountains. We went \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t catch us, the\nRussian, because if they catch you, they were controlled with Russian,\n[indecipherable] Russian they get you, then like they said, they take you to\nSiberia(ph). So we went to Czechoslovakia. From there we had to cut into\nHungary, also during the day \u2014 it was summer \u2014 during the day we were sitting on\nthe high grasses, lay down over there, because there was a lot of Russian patrols,\nand a lot of them got caught. And then we went, little by little, til we arrived to\nHungary. We went over to Hungary, back to Hungary, and when we arrived\nthere, also we \u2014 they caught us, because a lot of people, they were talking, and\nyou\u2019re not supposed to talk. And they \u2014 that time was the corn harvest, we were\nsitting in there, and at night we start running again. We \u2014 we went one place, we\nOctober 22, 1997\nhad a few dollars that time, we sold something. And there was a guy who used to\ntake over from \u2014 who took over the water there with the boats, something\n[indecipherable] from one place to the other one, so we gave him a few dollar, he\ntook us over in the other side, on the Hungarian side. And then we took a train over\nthere. The train which \u2014 the train will go to Budapest. Now also that train was so\nfull of people, local people, there was no place what to put nothing. We also find\nout that Hungary has no salt. There\u2019s no salt over there. So we took a few bags of\nsalt, and we \u2014 to take it back to Hungary, because that was a big commodity over\nthere. Oh, actually, the salt we had for nothing, because Romanian had so much\nsalt, which it was no problem. When we took the train, we also had to go on the\nslate roof. We had to go on the slate roof and lay down there, you know, to keep on\ngoing, which it took a few days from one area til we are \u2014 til we got to Budapest.\nNow who was there? It was there was my brother Areal(ph) and again my older\nsister with her husband, they remained behind. They \u2014 they decided they not ready\nto go back yet. So it was my other two sister, my brother and myself. So we stood\non that slate roof over there, also the bridge, 1t was so low you had to keep your\nhead down. And a lot of time, you know, the way those trains were going, it\u2019s not\nlike a train, you know, it was shaking you back and forth and throwing you around.\nThen finally we arrived in a\u2014 in Budapest. And from there, there \u2014 there was\nOctober 22, 1997\nalready \u2014 the Joint was there, and put us up there temporary places. We also had to\ngive for the Hungarian newspaper, we had to give interviews to them what\nhappened. And we stood there about a week or so, and then \u2014 the be \u2014 the Bricha,\nthe Jewish orga \u2014 the Jewish Bricha from \u2014 from that time of Palestine. So what\nthe Jewish Bricha from Palestine, working already to try to help people from\ndestination, one the other one. So the bi \u2014 Bricha brought us over to our destination\nclose to the Austrian border. I forgot to tell the name of the \u2014 of the city over there.\nAnd from there, the Bricha, they wanted we \u2014 we should go \u2014 we should go further.\nTh-The destination supposed to be Pa-Palestine that time. So, when we arrived in\nSaulfil(ph), Soulfil(ph) \u2014 something \u2014 so when we arrived over there in that place,\nof course we had to cross over to Austria. Now, how do you cross to Austria,\nbecause it was all Russians, all around. And then what the border was, it\u2019s so tight, I\nmean with soldier, that he couldn\u2019t go through at all over there, even through the\nfields, and more than it was in Hungary and Romania and Czechoslovakia. So w-\nwe sold a few things, a few \u2014 first of all, we sold the salt that we already had, about\n50 dollar that time for the salt, 1t was such a commodity. Must have schlepped\nmaybe 200 kilo of salt, between all of us. We had about 50 dollar already. Well, we\narrived over there in this place, so they told us, the only way you could go past\nthere, if you have to go, they have to take you over the border. We find out there is\nOctober 22, 1997\na guy, a Russian guy, a driver, he had a truck there, his name was Sashka(ph). We\ntalked to him \u2014 I mean, I didn\u2019t talk, because I didn\u2019t speak Russian. So there was\npeople who talked to him, and finally he agreed I think five dollars for each of us.\nWe wanted to give him shillings, Hungarian money, but we \u2014 because that was easy\nto get. He says no, he says, nyeda(ph) shilling, nyeda(ph) \u2014 dollare(ph),\ndollare(ph). So finally we give him five dollar each, still had a few dollar left, and\nhe fulled up the truck, a open truck. He says, all \u2014 everybody lay down in the truck.\nWe come to the border and the Austrians, they try to stop us with some soldier\nguard. You know what the guy did? He went right over them. He kept on going like\n\u2014 like nothing, he didn\u2019t care who stopped him or what, because there was \u2014 to him\nwas no border. And \u2014 and he took us in to \u2014 we passed Wiener Neustadt, and we\narrived in \u2014 in \u2014 in Vienna. In Vienna. We atrived in Vienna, that was the\ndestination.",
        "A: The time \u2014 the time from one to the other only took weeks, weeks, to get to this\ndestination. I would say it was summer, and really it could be in September\nsometime, August, September, because we didn\u2019t stay too long, we got liberated\nMay, and August, September, maybe October, we arrived in th \u2014 1n there. From\nthere \u2014 when we arrived to Vienna, we already had some helping, people helped us\nOctober 22, 1997\nand they told it, there 1s the Rothschild hospital, which they used that hospital Who\nare they? They \u2014 the \u2014 the Bricha from \u2014 from Palestine, they used that hospital. Of\ncourse, who paid? The Joint paid. The American Jew paid for that. So we used the\nhospital for all the refugees who got together. Now, Vienna you couldn\u2019t get out\njust like this, because Vienna \u2014 Vienna had the four zone over there. And we were\non the American zone. Now how you gonna get \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even go from one\nzone to the other one. Now how you gonna go 1n, and all \u2014 everybody wanted to go\nto the American zone because that was the right place to go 1f you wanted to\nemigrate, or even they had the French zone, the English zone, they didn\u2019t count\nmunch \u2014 much in that, they didn\u2019t care too much about the other zone. So it was\nvery interested when you are in the \u2014 in the hospital, in the Rothschild hospital,\nthey \u2014 the Joint, with the Bricha together, they \u2014 their leaders, they rented a truck, a\nbig truck and they made it special for \u2014 for \u2014 for people to be able to sit down in the\n\u20141n the side of the truck. And we should go from Vienna, we should go to Linz.\nLinz is in Austria. Of course Linz was already the American zone. There was a\nbridge over there, and that divided between the Russian and the American zone.\nWhen we got to \u2014 when we got f\u2014 we \u2014 we got on the way, you know, we \u2014 so what\nhappened in the mountain, the truck had an accident, banged with another truck. I\nhit so bad my arm there, and ripped off the r \u2014 the roof, everything, and we couldn\u2019t\nOctober 22, 1997\ngo further. So then we have to take a train. So we come with the train, they fulled\nup the train with so many people from the camps, ma \u2014 from other camps together\n[indecipherable] of three, because everybody want to run away. And we got with\nthe train, we got by the border by Linz, the Russians. We were told \u2014 they ask you\nwho you are \u2014 first of all, you don\u2019t speak no Russian, a word, even the people who\nspeak Russians, they shouldn\u2019t say a word in Russian. So they told us we should say\nwe are Greeks. We were displaced, thr-thrown out from Greece, and now we like to\ngo back. The train stopped there by the \u2014 by the bridge there, where it\u2019s supposed to\ngo over to the American zone, on the Russian zone, the train stopped there, and the\nRusskis came around. They were a little bit better dressed already, they didn\u2019t have\nthat knife and fork and \u2014 and sticked in in their boots. They were a little cleaner,\nthey come around this, and to every car they say, [speaks Russian] that \u2014 that much\nI learned. And nobody \u2014 everybody looked in them, and we kept on saying \u2014 a guy\ncame over to me, he says to me [Russian]? No, Greco, Greco, Greco. So he kept\non going, because that\u2019s what they told. But in that train with me, there was a lot of\nRussian \u2014 I know what they were looking, they were looking for deserters, mostly\ndeserters. There was a russ \u2014 a lot of Russian Jewish soldier, they deserted and they\nwent to Palestine. I would say most of the credit for the liberation, 1948, comes to\nthose Russian soldier, they were already trained, and they really know how to fight,\nOctober 22, 1997\nthose people, that\u2019s why \u2014 I was talking with them after. So finally they \u2014 we went\nto that bridge and we went into Linz already in the American zone. It was the \u2014 it\nwas something to us like in the liberation from the Nazis, because we really\nliberated now. We stood in Linz, they had camps there made up for displace\npersons. So I was talk with my sisters, my brother, I says to the \u2014 I says, you know,\nthis is too close to the Russian. I \u2014 I \u2014 we hated them so much what they did to us. I\nsaid, let\u2019s go further and far away from them, far away. So we went into Salzburg \u2014\nSalzburg, and they also had camp set up, a displaced person camp.",
        "A: That time the \u2014 the Joint was providing with a lot of stuff, but that time was the\nUNRRA. The \u2014 the organization which they \u2014 they \u2014 they did a terrific job, no\nquestion about it. Later on, it took over from the UNRRA, took over the IRO,\nInternational Refugee Organization. So they took over, but we were much better off\nin the UNRRA when we arrived in \u2014 in Salzburg. I had some mechanical and\nelectrician background. On the first thing I became the chief of [indecipherable]\nand I have here a statement from the lager camp, and it\u2019s written in Yiddish, and\nI\u2019m gonna read it for you Yiddish. It says [reads in Yiddish] So what it says in\nEnglish, that I was in \u2014 in \u2014in DP camp there, I became the chief electrician on the\nOctober 22, 1997\n\u2014on the camp, and there was a lot of people, thousands of people, and they all\ncounted to me and I did the best I can to make everybody comfortable, and \u2014 and\nthen that\u2019s why they give me this \u2014 this thing.",
        "A: In the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the English way, right? Okay. That\u2019s where we were \u2014 we are\na\u2014 we are telling that Pasternak [indecipherable], he \u2014 he \u2014 he was born in 1927,\nand he lived in the \u2014 in Salzburg, the camp in Salzburg they called Machne\nYehuda, estra(ph). He was the electrician in la \u2014 in the camp, and he did a lot of\ninstallation work, he made a lot of people very comfortable. People start to come\nthat time, the people who got liberated from Russia \u2014 there wasn\u2019t only\nconcentration \u2014 people from the concentration camp, there was already people they\ncame from Russia. And I \u2014 I tried to do the best and \u2014 and of course there was no\npay whatsoever for this, you did it just for the \u2014 for the sake of the people. And\nthat\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a signed by the [indecipherable] and it\u2019s signed by the \u2014 by\nthe whole \u2014 by the whole people in there who was in charge of that camp. But when\nI was in camp there, I did not really \u2014 I was not such a great electrician to be able to\nget a job any other place, you know. There, you put a wire right to left, and so you\ncan be an \u2014 you could get by. But I was very interested in the \u2014 in that kind of job\nfor my future, so I\u2014I went and I registered myself in \u2014 in I\u20141n the ORT school.\nOctober 22, 1997\nThey had a ORT school, and I \u2014 I learned there \u2014 I went there electrician school,\nbut I had a problem, yeah, I had a problem at the ORT school. One of the problem\n\u2014 most of them were speaking Polish, were mostly fr \u2014 they came from Russia. |\ndidn\u2019t speak a word Polish, a few words, so I had a problem, but the problem got\nsolved a little bit, I start picking up the Polish language, so it got a little bit better. I\nhad certificate right in front of my eyes with a picture from the ORT in Salzburg. It\nsays [indecipherable] student of electric, electrician in Salzburg, and this was\ngiven out to me in 1948. I also have one \u2014 another one that\u2019s \u2014 th-that\n[indecipherable] from the [RO \u2014 well, from the ORT, was in \u2014 in Haline(ph). It\nsays, Assembly Center Haline(ph), International Refugee Organization area, team\none, Salzburg, Austria, Haline(ph) 12 April 1949, that\u2019s when they give that out.\nAnd this is the certifica \u2014 the certif \u2014 certify that Pasternak Beru \u2014 I didn\u2019t even\nknow I used to call Bernard Beru, now I didn\u2019t even know this, they call me that\nBeru, b-e-r-u, born in 15/8/1927, in Oybarishu, Romania has been registered in\nCamp Reidenburg since August 1946 til August 1948. So you had to have all this\nthing if you wanted to emigrate to another country, you had to be registered 1n all\nthose places. So \u2014\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Mostly Jewish. Mostly \u2014 mostly \u2014 most of them Jewish people. That camp was\nin Salzburg, in Reidenburg what they called the camp, that was mostly all Jewish\npeople. It was, like I said, there was people from concentration camp, there was\npeople who arrive from Russia, and destination was Israel, because we supposed to\nget that \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the country is supposed to be born that time. Before \u2014\nbefore even the country was born, I had a little bit, you know, like something, a\nrevenge type \u2014 I felt myself I need some kind of revenge to see what they did to the\nJewish people, to the families, things like that. And the only thing what I could do\nto go in and to \u2014 to go to the Irgun, they had classes 1n \u2014 in the camp they had\nclasses for the Irgun. So I became a Irgunist. I did a few things, you know, right or\nwrong, whatever it was, so to take some kind of revenge, to see \u2014 and I learned to\nshoot very good, and I became to \u2014 to be a very good soldier in there. It took\nmonths and months. Of course, it was hidden, 1t was underground whole \u2014 the\nwhole thing. There was some already Israelis [indecipherable]. Matter of fact, most\nof them were Israelis who trained us how to shoot. And I never had a gun in my\nhand or thing like this. So they had, in Salzburg, they had big parks in there, in \u2014\nlike amusement parks. I went in the park one time with my friends, and you know,\nthey had this \u2014 to shoot the ducks or the other thing, and I aimed perfect and\neverything, whatever I want to shoot, so I became \u2014 matter of fact, they even said, 1-\nOctober 22, 1997\nif you go \u2014 when I go to Israel, is gonna be, I\u2019m gonna be the first sergeant without\nany st-st \u2014 star from the stripe, not from the beginning. They put me on for sergeant\nright away, the way I was leading, and the way I was operating and \u2014 and the way I\nwas learning the whole thing. I wanted to go to Israel so bad because before the\nwar, and I was a kid, I also belonged to organization Betar. I wanted to go to Israel\nthat time, but I could not go at that time because the parents were ver \u2014 very against,\nand also the rabbis were very against, and even that time, of which the Romanians\ndidn\u2019t care too much about the organization, we had to be underground 1n account\nof the Jew, our own Jewish people, because they said to me, if you step out of this\ncity from here, you\u2019re gonna became a non-Jew. So I says, well, there 1s \u2014 my aunt\nis in the United States and she\u2019s Jewish, and maybe I could go there. No, you\ncannot go no place, otherwise you\u2019re not gonna be a Jew, you\u2019re gonna throw away\nyour heritage, your Jewish heritage. And they \u2014 matter of fact, really I wanted to go\nto Israel because my \u2014 my \u2014 I \u2014 the Zionists were so much \u2014 even now, my Zionist\nwas so much in me, I wanted to go just to Israel. I didn\u2019t care, I wanted to be\n[indecipherable] just to go, and I was young, 17 - 18 year. I could not go because\nthose rabbi didn\u2019t let me. And I tell you the truth, I have a hatred for that, because\nthey hold us back, all the kids. Most of the kids they even \u2014 they even got killed in\nthe concentration camp. So when I was already ready to go to Israel, which I\nOctober 22, 1997\nmentioned, I had an aunt, she lived in the Bronx, and \u2014 156 Honeywell Avenue,\nand was [indecipherable] Boulevard, so Southern Boulevard. So I went and we\ndidn\u2019t know her address, but my older sister Rose, she remembered she used to\nwrite to \u2014 my mother used to write to her sister. She remembered the address by\nheart. So we wrote her, and she said, dear, we are so happy you are alive, and things\nlike this. She said, don\u2019t try to go any other place, come to the United States first. I\nhave \u2014 matter of fact, I have papers here in front of me. When my aunt send us all\npaper, you know, the affidavits with working, with all the guarantee. She says, first\ncome here and then you gonna go to Israel, Israel just created right now, it\u2019s gonna\nbe a little hardship. I says, I don\u2019t care the hardship, that\u2019s what I want to do. And\nfinally I couldn\u2019t leave my sister, we \u2014 we have such a few left, so finally we\ndecided we come to United States.",
        "A: We were al \u2014 my sisters, all sister, my brother, we were all in the prekee ca \u2014\nDP camp in Salzburg, except my older sister with her husband, they remain behind.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Yes, well, we had the Austrians there and \u2014 and in the Reidenburg camp, there\nwas a fire brigade in there. I went out with my friend and we blew up a truck over\nthere, we put something in there, we blew up the truck. There was no human life\nlost. And it was another time we went to \u2014 to a bridge there, we know that a lot of\nGermans are passing over there, we blew up the bridge over there, so we really got\na little revenge in a different way. But I still wanted to go to Israel with that time,\nlike with the training thing I had and I was very, very famous [indecipherable]\nguys there. But I feel very bad my aunt took th \u2014 talked us into come to this country,\nwhich \u2014 and then, you know, once you came 1n this country, so you don\u2019t go away\nso easy, so \u2014 I cha \u2014 also want to mention, my brother, Azreal(ph), he had so much\ncourage, which I, tell you the truth, I wouldn\u2019t do it. What did he do? He went back\nto Romania in the town, he got my sister and my brother-in-law and brought them\nback to Austria. We alre \u2014 I already had some money in there in the camp because I\nwas doing some work sa \u2014 for the Austrians, I was doing some work outside the\ncamp. They needed electricians, so I went, my friends and we did some work. The\nAustrians, the work what we did, it was not really for the Austrians, it was for the\nAmerican soldiers, they were living in Austria in the houses, in the apartment, and\nthey needed some lights and all those thing, and we used to put them on, I used to\nget the stove, you know, all the merchandise, whatever I need. And I used to do\nOctober 22, 1997\nsome work from them, so I already had some money. And we give this whole\nwhatever we had to my brother, and he start the journey back and he got them back\nsafe to Austria, I mean, to Salzburg, I says \u2014 I don\u2019t know whoever could do\nsomething like this, but he had the guts and he did it. So til \u2014 we all got together, we\nall were, the whole family got together in Austria.",
        "A: Well, it f\u2014 we f-\u2014 first of all, we talked about families, what happened. And\nwhen we went in in \u2014 in the concentration camp, we didn\u2019t know what happened,\nwe didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, anyhow, til we were in there. So everybody used\nto tell the story, I was there, I was there, and one guy says, oh I was there too. I\nsays, I was in the same block and I couldn\u2019t rec \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know he was there.\nAnd the main [indecipherable] the whole thing you want to know 1s all just Israel,\njust Israel, to get the land of Israel, to get to our own place. Also, at the first time,\nand it was a holiday, it was Passover at that time, and there was the Austrian station,\nthe [indecipherable] radio station, and the first time we heard Yiddish speaking on\nthe Austrian radio station to wish us happy, healthy holiday. And it was one of the\nOctober 22, 1997\ngreatest things to \u2014 to hear a Jewish voice f-from, you know especially in \u2014 in\nAustrian, Na-Nazi land, and \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: No. I\u2014I don\u2019t think there was any demonstration, because he ha \u2014 you didn\u2019t\nhave [indecipherable] to demonstrate whatsoe \u2014 we did have different type of\ndemonstration. We had demonstration, there used to be a lot of guys, they used to\ngo out on Salzburg, they used to beat up guys, German guys, Austrian guy, they\nused to beat them up. They used to be caught by the police, and the police arrested\nthem, and we couldn\u2019t see this \u2014 a German sol \u2014 German people to hold our own\npeople, so we start to demonstrating, we didn\u2019t want to eat that time, you know, we\ntook the food out the middle of the camp, and we took the \u2014 there was a kitchen\nthere, I mean, there was a lot of food, and \u2014 and we spilled the food on the street\nover there, and we showed the camp commander \u2014 he was an American \u2014 that we\nnot gonna tolerate something like this. So they finally have the agreement that we\ngonna hold them in our own jails to find out what \u2014 so we brought them back to the\ncamp and matter of fact, the guy\u2019s name was Kulnik(ph), so he brought him back in\nthe camp, and \u2014 til the trial came and they had trial about it and they find him not\nguilty. But they also give him the punishment \u2014 the judge in there give him the first\nOctober 22, 1997\npunishment, he said, you have to leave the country right away. And there was no \u2014\nyou know, there was no com \u2014 transportation to go anyplace, so there was special\ntransportation for some of those guys, they took them straight to Palestine. Final \u2014\nfinal \u2014 probably they wind up in \u2014 in Cyprus that time. But that was the\npunishment. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes, because we put \u2014 we left our \u2014 our \u2014 our \u2014 w-we put a [indecipherable].\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna be, so they know right away that it comes from us. But\nnobody would expect me whatsoever, I was such a quiet guy in camp, fixing\neverything in there. And then we went out, had a few guys, they really were tough.\nLike, I was mentioning these Ru-Russian soldiers \u2014 the Jewish soldiers, and they\nwere really trained, they were really some [indecipherable] what they say, they\nreally did. And they did some contribution to the \u2014 to Palestine that time. They\nwere good.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: [indecipherable] that\u2019s what it\u2019s ga \u2014 that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gonna be. The way you\nsay \u2014 way they say never again, this was [indecipherable] you know something,\nthat\u2019s the way it\u2019s gotta be. And \u2014",
        "A: And only like this and they know right away that \u2014 matter of fact, they gave us a\nname, the German; [indecipherable] was here. They \u2014 the way they p \u2014 they\npronounced it. So \u2014 actually we \u2014 we \u2014 we just took our little revenge and \u2014 and \u2014 to\nshow them that we are not sleeping people, we are not people you could shove us\naround, and we could do something too. Thing like that. And they \u2014 the \u2014 the\nGermans, they \u2014 I would say they start respecting us in general. We also did \u2014 we\nalso traveled to Germany itself, to Minchen(ph) where there was a \u2014 so many\nJewish people in there, so we had co-contact, along with the other one, and we got\ncaught by the border too, by the American soldiers, we got caught, because it\u2019s still\na country, going to the other one. And we got caught by the border, he\u2019s \u2014 we \u2014 we\nsupposed to go that time to \u2014 to Minchen(ph) from Salzburg. So when we got by\nthe border, so two MPs come over, they say halt. Stay there, he says. Where are you\ngoing? I say, we gonna go to Salzburg. It\u2019s not true, because we came from\nSalzburg. He said, you can\u2019t go, you have to go to Minchen(ph). And that\u2019s the\nway we went right through. So, we had to laugh in our own way, you know. But we\nOctober 22, 1997\ndid got caught a few more times and \u2014 and \u2014 in that \u2014 in that thing, by the border\nthing. It was guarded by the allies, you know, and couldn\u2019t fool around too much,\nso \u2014 but we were young, you know, and full of hate, hate from the \u2014 what they did\nto us, you know, and \u2014 and matter of fact, I saw, when I was a kid, and when the\nHungarian soldier marched by in the 40 \u2014 in the 40s, and they stopped \u2014 the\nsoldiers, they \u2014 they stopped the regiment over there, right in front of the shul, and\none of the Hungarian officer, he says to two, three guys, he says, there\u2019s a lot of\nJews there, I want you to pull their ber \u2014 beard out and hit them. You know, so they\npulled the beard, they hit them, they kept on going. And this, you know, this \u2014 this\nthing kept telling me, eating and eating inside, why, why, why? Because why are\nthey doing that, because I have another religion? There\u2019s so many religions, well\nwhy pick my religion? So it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s start to be, you know, and it never went\naway, it\u2019s still the same thing, I still feel why, why, why they did it to us? Why they\ndid it small children things like this, and with no mercy whatsoever.",
        "A: Soon \u2014 soon you went out of the camps, when we went out of the concentration\ncamp and you see the Jewish people there. You know, you could have see people,\nyou know, putting on the twill and stuff, praying over there, and then from the back\nhe got shot because he\u2019s putting on twill, something like this, you know. And\nOctober 22, 1997\nanother \u2014 the \u2014 stay there and they pick up their hands and pray to God to come a\nmiracle, they got killed. The miracle was they got killed. So you could see your own\nJewish people. Look, I am Jewish. I wouldn\u2019t change my religion if you killed me.\nEven I went through all the prosecution thing, whatever they did to me, it \u2014 I like\nvery much where I am, but [indecipherable] we have our own \u2014 our own thing\nbetween the extremists and the thing, so 1-it\u2019s not such a good idea, I think we\nshould get a little more better united than [indecipherable]. In case God forbid\nsomething like this comes around, we should be united, which we were not united\nthose days, because there were too extreme, and they all \u2014 and they forced us to be\nextreme and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel like being extreme, we just wanted to be\ngood Jewish people. And little by little starts up and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, before the war, when we were kids, the religion was so strong, they force\nyou to do things, which you didn\u2019t even feel like doing all those things. Because\nthey were so afraid you gon \u2014 you not \u2014 you gonna be a non-Jew. And I think that\nwas the wrong way to force somebody to be a Jew, because you have to be the\nextreme way. You could be a go \u2014 a good Jew, and you could be Jew in your heart,\nand \u2014 and not to be the extreme way, to be \u2014 to God and to people. For God and for\n[indecipherable] you know, you have to be both ways, you cannot do things in one\nOctober 22, 1997\nway. And we suffered a lot for that, because we were not united, even those days.\nWhen I wanted to go to Palestine, they told me I\u2019m gonna be a goy, I\u2019m not gonna\nbe a Jew after all, I wanted to come to United States, or any other place. I had be\njust in \u2014 in that place where in that town over there, where you could grow up a\ngood Jew. The misery was so bad in there, there was no food, there was no nothing,\nbut the religion was on top. First the religion, and then it came the food. No, it wa \u2014\nit was very hard to \u2014 and then you could see what\u2019s going on, you know, and you\nhave different idea, you think different, and \u2014 and the problem arrived little by little.\nOctober 22, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: After I was in the \u2014 in Austria and Salzburg, camp name was Reidenburg, we\nprepared, you know, I mean people start moving out, they start going to Israel, start\ngoing to other countries. A lot of visas came in from almost all over the western\nworld, that they take in so many people, so many people. And due to the fact my\naunt, she wrote us we should come to the United States first, so of course you have\nto prepare yourself to come to the State to see, because like my aunt said, so few\nwere left of her \u2014 of my sister\u2019s children, I would like very much you should come\nhere first, but then you make your destination further. So we start preparing to do \u2014\ncome to the \u2014 the United States. There was a lot of visas you could go in any other\ncountry, like my brother-in-law went to South America. And I had friends, they\nwent to Australia. They went all over the world, but my aim was now the United\nStates. So from Austria they did not take people yet to go to the United States. So\nwe heard in Italy this \u2014 it\u2019s a faster quota there, you could go faster from Italy to\nthe States. So we went to Italy. We went some friends and we went to Italy. So, it\nOctober 22, 1997\n\u2014 it didn\u2019t go so smooth either. We had to \u2014 from Salzburg we had to go to\nInnsbruck. From Innsbruck \u2014 this is Austria, from Innsbruck in the area, to go\nover the border to Italy. So Italy was already independent, and they had the \u2014\nwatching the border there, and a \u2014 soldier were there and we were trying to go over\nthe border, they caught us a few times. That\u2019s why I will never forget those Italian\nthat time. They caught us twice, and due to the fact I speak Romanian, and it wasn\u2019t\ntoo much a \u2014 of a differential for the Italian, so I start talking to the guy, he ask me,\nwhere you go? I says, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m looking for a be \u2014 a better world. I\u2019m looking for\nthe \u2014 to settle myself. He say, you want to settle Italy? I says, no, I have an aunt in\nthe United States. He says, okay, but right now what we have to do with you guy,\nwe have to send you back, because that\u2019s the rule. And next time we\u2019ll see. It just\nhappened, the guards there, they saw what\u2019s coming, and they turn around the other\nway and they say, Avanti! Avanti! Avanti! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. So we went\nover the border, and we took a train, and we went into Meran, not Milano, Meran.\nThis is then the northern part between Austria and Italy. So we went into that city\nover there. Of course, the Joint was there already. And from Meran they made\narrangements, and we went to Milano. And also they had the camp there, only\ntransit. Meran was a transit camp and Milano was a transit camp. So they, from\nthere we sh \u2014 we went to a place not f-far from Meran, they called it Chiari after,\nOctober 22, 1997\nChiari. In that they had a camp already established to go to is \u2014 to Israel, to go to\nany other place, or to United States. It was a faster \u2014 you know, faster \u2014 you get\nvisa much faster over there to go wherever you gonna go. So I was in that place in\nChiari for a little while, and then I heard that if you go to Bari, it\u2019s much faster\nfrom Bari. So we went by train, it took all night. The train were going a little faster\nthan in Romania, so we went all night, we went to Bari. Bari had a camp which it\nwas the \u2014 you could have stayed there and there\u2019s camps there, but there was\nanother place not far from Bari, they called it Trani. And we went to that camp, it\nalso was about five hours or so with the train, approximately. So we went into\nTrani over there, and we stood there for a little while, a f\u2014 months already. The\nwhole thing took a year and a half or something like this, wh-what I\u2019m telling you,\nbetween Austria and Italy all those things. So when it came, there was a delegation\nover there, and they start taking all the refugee people to go to the United States.\nNow, it wasn\u2019t so easy to come to United States. First of all, you had to go through\nfrom he \u2014 head to tail, they \u2014 they checked you out. Well, they checked out you in\ngeneral, and they find out \u2014 and they wanted to know if you have anybody\nsponsoring you. And wanted to know if you have a trade and the feeling, and all\nthose things. And how intelligent you are, they showed something to look. And in\nbooks, something to figure out numbers like they do it for children now, they put it\nOctober 22, 1997\none, two, thr-three together. I did put them \u2014 I could put them all together because\nthe colors were so funny, I could put them together. So the bottom line, everything\nwas set, and it \u2014 did they come that we are ready to go to the United States. So\nfrom there, from Bari we went to Naples. We stood there for a little while, I think\nthey had some kind of a strike that time, so we hanged out to Naples. And \u2014 and\nthen finally we had a boat, we had [indecipherable] a boat \u2014 matter of fact, they\njust brought some soldiers over to Italy and the boat was empty to go back, and the\nboat\u2019s name was General Greely. So we went in in the boat in there, and of course,\nafter being so hungry all those years, I was watching to eat because I shouldn\u2019t get\nsick again. But I\u2014 I was always hungry. Matter of fact, I\u2019m even hungry now. I\nmean, I cannot full myself up from those bad days. So I went to the boat, we went\nin there and right away I volunteer to work. Because wherever I went in Italy, I\nworked. I made some money in the \u2014 all those places where I stood, I always look\nfor a\u2014 sometimes I worked in the camp, they paid, because the Italian government\npaid for that. So I had some money and tell you, the first time I saw what life is\nwhen I was in Italy. First of all, the people were so nice. It\u2019s a different type of\npeople over there, and so friendly and generous. And I had money, and I never\nknow how to live, and this \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 tell you, this I \u2014 I know this 1s the best life\nwhat I ever had up til now, because all the \u2014 matter of fact, we went into \u2014 the\nOctober 22, 1997\ngovernment was so nice in general to us. We went in, when we were in Milano, and\nthere was a theater playing that time in this [indecipherable] Milano. I went in\nthere and th-there was no room whatsoever, but due to the fact we told them we are\n\u2014 we are fr \u2014 refugees, so \u2014 which I speak the language already. We are refugees, so\nright away they made us at home and they took us in there to see the opera. And I\nwas not much interested in opera thing, so I walked right out the other way, you\nknow, they shouldn\u2019t see me, they made so much effort to get me in. So I walked\nout. And there was other places which I was interested and they gave us so much\nrespect for the \u2014 because we were refugee, profugo they called it, we are refugees.\nMatter of fact, a lot of time you could have go from one place to the other over the\ntrain free because they know you are a refugee, and what you went through. So\nfinally we go in the boat, General Greely. I said \u2014 they ask volunteers, I went to\nwork in the kitchen, where the food is. So I went to work in there in the kitchen, and\nI was doing \u2014 in Italy I traveled around from one place to the other one. I went to a\nlot of place; I went to Pompeii, I went to other places. I went to see, you know, all\nthe old places, and I went to Assisi. Well, ha \u2014 you name it, I went all over Italy to\nsee, because I had an opportunity to travel. So I worked in the kitchen in the boat, I\nworked in the kitchen. And the third day I got so sick, I got so sick with all the food.\nMatter of fact, it\u2019s not only me, the whole boat got sick. Everybody got sick\nOctober 22, 1997\n[indecipherable] throw all the food around there. It was something. But I have\nsome friends, they live now in Queens on \u2014 in New York. And just a couple of\nguys, they were standing there and they were laughing [indecipherable] and then\nnothing affected them whatsoever. So it took a few days pass the island of Capri,\nand the boat to come in. And a few days after we come to ourselves you know, and\nwe start acting a little bit normal. But the boat, it was some kind of a storm, and you\ncould see the boat, you know, th-the plates in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the mess hall where\npeople were eating, you see, while they were eating, the soup was going one place\nto the other one, it was going back and forth with the boat and rockling the boat.\nAnd finally we come to our desti \u2014 destination. We c \u2014 we came to New York. Now",
        "A: Well, I had \u2014I figured I have a trade, which it didn\u2019t do much good in this\ncountry because they were doing different, but I had a start. And th-the whole thing\nwas in my head just to settle down and \u2014 and to start living like a human being, not\nto travel around all over. So when I arrived in the \u2014 1n the country, they \u2014 we came\nstraight in the harbor in New York City. I could never find out where the boat\nlanded, it was in December 1949. I could never find out which harbor it come in. I\nOctober 22, 1997\nwanted to go see the \u2014 really the place. Soon I walked down, there was a lot of\norganization, there was Christian organization, other organization waiting for their\nrefugees, because in the boat was not only Jewish people, because there was\nrefugees from \u2014 almost from all the Eastern Bloc. Some refugees were fr \u2014 they\nwere Russians, from Russia they came. They were Polish, but they were in Russia.\nSome refugees [indecipherable] they run away from the Germans, and some of\nthem they run away from the Russian. I don\u2019t know what kind of a people, what\ntheir background was, what their pol \u2014 politic was, I don\u2019t know. They were\nscreened in \u2014 in Italy before they came, I don\u2019t know. So they \u2014 those organizations\nright away we had \u2014 like I had something written HIAS in my shirt, some people\nhad different organization. So we had to go to the \u2014 each group. Matter of fact, I\nwalked over to a Christian organization, I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s all about, and then \u2014\nand the \u2014 the woman was so nice, he says, no, he says, the Jude organization is\nright across on the other side on the hall. So when I came over, the HIAS on\nLafayette Street in New York City had already established for refugees who came\nover from the other side. They had room and board and they were looking for jobs\nfor them, they took us downtown to the \u2014 in another place, to the Joint. I forgot the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the street over there, where they took us in there, and \u2014 and what the\ninterview was for jobs, what we know. So that time, when I came from Italy, my\nOctober 22, 1997\nsisters were here already. They ca \u2014 they \u2014 they came from Austria because they\nwere single and it was easier to get them out. So my sister and my brother came\nalready. And they waited me \u2014 they waited for me six months before they came,\nthey waited for me. First of all, I could have come really before. I didn\u2019t want to\nleave Italy. I had such a good life over there, why leave such a good life? Why go\naway? But my friends told me, this life is good, but United States even is a better\nlife. I say, what do you mean? So they says to me, did you see the Marshall plan,\nan-and all over Austria and Germany and Italy? I say yes. He says, you see, all the\nstar \u2014 things comes from the United States. Could you imagine if you go to the\nsource where you got all those things? And there how good it could we? So I let\nmyself talk in, I say you are right and we came over. And when we were \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 the arrangement from the organization, they made arrangement we should\ngo to Lafayette Street. But my sisters \u2014 sisters and my brother told me, he says, it\u2019s\nnot so cozy with my aunt, the way she wrote we should go. First thing my aunt did,\nshe looked all over our packages, she figured we have a lot of money in there, we\nbrought over from Europe. So it was a different aim and so soon they saw me, they\nsay, you not going to my aunt, he says, you go to the HIAS in there, and \u2014 and be\nestablished from over there, whatever you have to do. You want to go from there.\nSo I find they already give me all the information there, so I went to the HIAS.\nOctober 22, 1997\nNow they took taxis, they had taxis to take from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the thing \u2014\nfrom the boat there, from the terminal there. They had taxis to take you to the\nHIAS. I walked on the street, and I \u2014 with my head down, I looked down. So the\nguys asked me in Yiddish, he says to me, what are you looking for? Wassusto(ph).\nI said well, I was told there\u2019s a lot of money in the streets in the United States, I\nthought maybe I could pick some \u2014 maybe I could pick up some. The guy says to\nme in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish]. Til you gonna see a dollar, you\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019re gonna\nget black and blue til you gonna find a dollar here. You gotta work your head off. I\nsays to my friend, see why we came? You gonna work your head off, you had such\na good life in Italy. So he says to me, one guy which you get a \u2014 still in contact \u2014\nwe still have a few friends we are in contact from the camps. They are spread all\nover. So, I says to him, okay, let\u2019s see the bottom line what\u2019s gonna happen. So we\n\u2014 I always wanted to go back to Italy. Whatever I did, I wasn\u2019t happy, I just wanted\nto go to Italy, I want to go to Italy. So once got together with my sister and my bro\n\u2014 my brother. He sits down there, he says to me, look, we know you had a good life\nin Italy, better than we had in Austria, because it\u2019s a different country, different\n[indecipherable] with better things in there. But I want to tell you something, my\nbrother says to me, when you came with the boat, did you see the Statue of Liberty?\nI say, what\u2019s the Statue of Liberty? Did you see somebody like a woman holding\nOctober 22, 1997\none hand up and one hand down, with a book\u2019? I say yeah. He says, you know what\nthat means by us refugee? The hand up means welcome to United States. The hand\ndown means, you never gonna leave the United States. Here you gonna be buried\nand die in the United States, you never gonna leave that. So we all start laughing\nand that\u2019s what it happened, exactly what happened, you just go [indecipherable]\nthink like this, so you\u2019ll always come back to the United States. So we were in the\nHIAS a week or so, and then they took us to a \u2014 to the Joint in there to start\ninterviewing us. What kind of \u2014 they had a big \u2014 big building over there, just \u2014 I just\nforgot the place. And there was a lot of people, they interview you in your own\nlanguage, [indecipherable] what job you could know, what job you could do. And I\ntold them what I could do, and \u2014 but in the meantime til they find something, I \u2014 my\naunt had a cousin here, and he was a tinsmith. So in the meantime, I \u2014 I \u2014 of \u2014 I just\n\u2014I\u2014I was without work maybe \u2014 maybe, maybe two months. So he says to me,\nlook, a temporary thing til you get the real job, you come work for me. I have work\nfor a\u2014 once in a while I have a little work. I do roofing, I do other thing, repairing.\nSo I says, okay. So got a few dollars that time, for \u2014 so I went to work for him, he\nwas someplace in \u2014 in Brooklyn, and you had \u2014 go travel from New York to\nBrooklyn, if you don\u2019t know you \u2014 you know, you don\u2019t know your way, you don\u2019t\nknow the language. So I supposed to start eight o\u2019clock, I used to leave 5:30 in the\nOctober 22, 1997\nmorning because I left a few hours for going from one place to the other one, one\ntrain \u2014 I traveled all over the city before I re \u2014 I reached the destination. I think it\nwas in Grammerton(ph) Avenue in Brooklyn, he had a job, til I got used, better\nand better. And my uncle wanted to show off that he\u2019s a real American when I used\nto go downtown from him from \u2014 fr \u2014 when I used to go with him, travel around\nfrom one place to the other one. So he bought a newspaper, he looks in the\nnewspaper \u2014 I don\u2019t even think he knew how to read that time because the\nnewspaper wasn\u2019t even straight. So he takes the paper, looks in it, he comes to the\nstation the next day, he throws it in the garbage. He says, you see, that\u2019s what you\ndo in United States. You look in the newspaper, you have no time to, you throw it\naway. I don\u2019t even think he knows anything in that thing because he couldn\u2019t read at\nall. Why he wanted to make an impression to me, that he \u2014 and then I went out\nafter, I went out with my cousins and they took me around, they took me to ice\ncream parlor. And I go in there and get an ice cream. She says, you know what you\nwith that? You lick it. I said, no kidding, I said, I didn\u2019t know you lick ice cream. I\nsays, you think I come from the mountains, I didn\u2019t have ice cream in Italy, or in\nany other place? So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want [indecipherable] so I\u2019m glad you told me,\nat least you teach me something, you know, weth \u2014 important thing. So finally I got\n\u2014 I went back for the interview and for the job, and they still couldn\u2019t find the right\nOctober 22, 1997\njob for me. I find some people who we came over with the boat together, I ask\nthem, where you working? So they told me, I\u2019m working there and there in a metal\nfactory, but it\u2019s so dirty over there, we couldn\u2019t take the dirt. So he says, but I\u2019m\nsure with your background, I think you could get a job over there and you could\nwork in there, provided you like the grease and the dirt. So I went in the place for an\ninterview, and the guy was talking to me in English, what the heck, I know English,\nI know a few word, okay, okay [indecipherable]. So he says to me, first I want you\nto go try my friend, he has a place over there and see if he could get you a job. So I\nwent over to the guy over there someplace in Manhattan. I went in there, I see\npeople working, cutting wood and other thing, just \u2014 just a regular work. Went in\nthere, he start talking to me, I didn\u2019t understand not one word he was saying. I had\nto work harder, I say okay, okay, I don\u2019t understand a word. I mean, to give me the\ncourtesy, I speak so many languages, can\u2019t you talk to me in a different type of\nlanguage? So was sticking to the English. So then I went back to the \u2014 to the place\nwhere the guy told me he is working. I went in there and comes out \u2014 the guy comes\nout first, interviews me and then the boss comes out and checks out the interview,\nsee \u2014 he looks at me, he says, you know, I see something in you. I\u2019m gonna give\nyou a job. And I\u2019m gonna try you out, see what you could do. So I went in in that\nfactory over there, machinery, dust flying all over, because that time they didn\u2019t\nOctober 22, 1997\ncare too much about the pollution, all those thing. And I went in there and I would\ntake anything, because if you have no language, I mean you don\u2019t know the\nlanguage, you have to take what you can. So I went in there and start working.",
        "A: I felt welcome almost by everybody because I have my tattoo number from\nAuschwitz, and it was summer too, and I was going without the jacket. And matter\nof fact, some of the American people, they even got up and get me the seat, even the\nolder people, they says, here, sit down, I see you standing up. But I was very\nwelcome by the Jewish people in general, talking about the \u2014 the refugees, wa \u2014 all\nthey went through. And also some of the people and \u2014 and \u2014 in \u2014 in the job, they\nwere afraid that something is wrong with me because I went to a camp, or maybe I\ndid some kind of a criminal activities I did, why di \u2014 they put me in a camp, because\nthey couldn\u2019t understand why I was, you know, in prison for something like this. So\nit was very hard to explain, which I could not explain, but after they saw pictures,\nand they saw the newspapers, so they start to get a little bit educated more, a-and\nstart to accept me. But I should say, the worst \u2014 somebody to call me Jew, or thing\nlike this, yes I do have encounter with the people who were working. I \u2014 I\nunderstand already a little bit, and I remember one guy used to call me hey Jew-\nboy, come over here, hey, Jew-boy. I figured that\u2019s the way you call somebody\nOctober 22, 1997\nover, til somebody else told me what it means. But I couldn\u2019t do nothing anyhow,\nand I didn\u2019t want to start up anything because like I said, I was afraid for the job,\nan-and that guy was a little leader over there. And on the end, we worked together\nwith the guy, but I never trusted him because he never trusted me either. So he was\ndoing some mechanical thing and I was doing different thing. And I did not\nencounter anything, I would say, went in in a store, thing like this, cause \u2014 what \u2014\nno \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say ant \u2014 anti-Semitic thing when I came to this country. Maybe I\ndidn\u2019t understand, I didn\u2019t speak the language, but [indecipherable] I think it\nturned out pretty good.",
        "A: Yes, there was a lot of talk about it when they went to the shul in France, and\nwhen I use \u2014 started \u2014 started going out with girl, they ask me the background, what\nhappened. And like I say, soon they saw my number, they know I went through\nhell. And they tried to understand, but I couldn\u2019t make nobody understand, because\nnobody could believe it.",
        "A: I told them the experiences. I was a kid I was taking away because I was Jewish,\nand I was taking so many different thing, and exterminate the family, just because\nOctober 22, 1997\nthey were Jewish. And it was very hard to understand for the people in general. But\nlater on when I start already speaking the language, then it was a different \u2014 I\nexplain it to them different and then they start to accept what I went through.",
        "A: When I start working first in the job, I was starting with 70 cents an hour. But I\nwould say the boss liked me and I start working overtime. So it was a heck of a\ndirty job in general. It was so dirty that a shower wouldn\u2019t take off that dirt, that\nblack stuff. But I already had money, so you start thinking about settling down and\nstart having a different social life. So I used to go out with \u2014 with girls in general,\nbut somehow, we were afraid \u2014 the refugee, they were afraid for the American girls.\nWhy? Soon you start talking to them, the first question, do you have a car? I said, I\ndon\u2019t even have a bicycle, not a car, I mean I just came, you want me to have a car?\nSo then I was afraid, I didn\u2019t date it the second time, because who knows if she asks\nfor a car, what will happen later on, what you ask? So, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t bother. But\na few years later, about two years later I did bought a car, because I had better\nopportunities to date girls. So I took them out. I ha \u2014 I\u2019m very poor, you know, in\nthe sense of direction, I only know \u2014 if I go out someplace and turn back, sometimes\nI lose my sense of direction. And I also, I am colorblind, so I had those two\nOctober 22, 1997\nproblems. And \u2014 but those girls, they know their way and I tell them I want to go\nthere, I say, but I never been there before, which it wasn\u2019t true, I was there before, I\n\u2014 but I didn\u2019t know how to get there again. So they directed me over there, and I\nhad a 1942 Dodge. [ had a lot of trouble with that car, but I kept it running just to\nget better dates and which it happened to me and \u2014 but the thing 1s this, I still \u2014 I\nwas sitting in the car one time, I never forget, and I said, enough is enough, I say, I\nshould settle down and start living a family life. And I say, well, you find the right\ngirl, you say, you just can\u2019t jump into something like this. So we did \u2014 we dated\nvery few American girls, and most of them we dated our own type of girls. Not\nnecessary Romanian, it could be from any other country we dated, because our view\nwas different, our aim was different and we had nobody you know, we had to stick\nto each other, so it was a different type of dating.",
        "A: Well, I was going her \u2014 with a girl from Czechoslovakia. And you know, if\nsomebody pushes you, you push back, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 you go a step back.\nShe was pushing me to get married, she was nice lady, good looking, everything\nwas right, but somehow, I was pressed too much, you say, when you gonna marry,\nwhen you gonna marry? And I wasn\u2019t ready that time. So that time \u2014 the refugees\nused to get together in Manhattan in Hotel Diplomat. You always find, whenever\nOctober 22, 1997\nyou wanted to go to a dance, or you want to meet somebody, you could meet them\nat two places, on front of the HIAS, Lafayette Street, or in \u2014 in Hotel Diplomat,\nthere you could meet. So I went with her to a dance. Didn\u2019t know how to dance\nreally, but I went to a dance. I start learning how to dance, and so we saw a lot of\nfriends there, we got together a lot of friends over there. And then she says to me,\nmeet my friend. So I meet \u2014 met her friend, and said hi, things like this. And then I\nlook in the friend, I say gee, I would like to marry that girl, because she had\neverything what I really wanted. I always liked black eye, dark eyes. I alwa \u2014\nbecause Europe most of them got blue eyes \u2014 matter of fact, I have blue eyes, too \u2014\nI always wanted somebody in the darker side, because most of them are, like I said,\nblonde. And she had all the thing I \u2014 what a girl could have, and I wanted to meet\nher very bad, and so little by little, I ask her for a date, but she had somebody \u2014\ngoing with somebody. I didn\u2019t succeed the first time, I didn\u2019t succeed the second\ntime, so I kept on pushing, not the strong way, because I had a lesson from the other\ngirl, you had to approach very easy. So I \u2014 finally we had a date. She lived in\n[indecipherable] by her aunt. She also from eu \u2014 Europe, she came from\nTransylvania, Romania and Hungary, and she was by an aunt or by a cousin in\nMount Vernon. She came in 1946 as a kid the \u2014 with the children transport. And I\nwent out with her once or twice and \u2014 and looks like she was not too much\nOctober 22, 1997\ninterested in me and you can\u2019t press something like this, has to come mostly natural,\nand we broke off. That time, I have in \u2014 in papers here, that I \u2014 the Korean War was\non that time and I went to register to the army. I was trained already, might as well\ndo some service for the United States. So I went to register it, and the registration\nto the army was [indecipherable] Arthur Avenue. And I got my registration thing\nand then they called me back to see \u2014 fi-first they gave me 1-A, they took \u2014 call me\nback, I passed all the physical, I passed everything. I didn\u2019t pass the language, I\ndidn\u2019t speak the language, just a little bit. So the guy says to me, language is no\ngood, we need somebody who speaks English and we have no schooling over there,\nthings like this. And you could make one mistake, the whole platoon could die fe \u2014\nbecause you don\u2019t speak the language. And I got 4-F. And I\u2019m carrying around the\n1-A and the 4-F with me since I \u2014 when I went to register to the army. So I didn\u2019t\nsucceed. My wife now, she find out \u2014 which her name is Bella, Brocha(ph) 1n \u2014 in\nYiddish, she find out that I am going to the Korea \u2014 to the war. So she picked up\nthe phone and she asked me, 1s true you are going to the army? I says yeah, I just\nsaid, I\u2019m supposed to go to the army, I am waiting. And then the meantime I \u2014 give\nme a lot of courage, because she called, and I said, would you like to go out for a\ndate? She says, okay, before you go to the Korean War, I go out with you. So I went\nout with her once, I went out with her twice, and it came through that 4-F. She was\nOctober 22, 1997\ngoing with somebody, if she cared, she didn\u2019t care too much. The cousin where she\nwas living, so she says, gee I\u2019m torn \u2014 my wife says, I\u2019m torn between two things,\nshe says. I got this guy, and I got this guy. I says, what do I do? So the uncle, or the\ncousin, he says to her, look, I don\u2019t know much about the other guy, but I could tell\nyou this; Bernie comes from Mamurish(ph) and I know all those people, they work\nvery hard, and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t go hungry. And it looks like he did the trick\nand finally we go out again. And we went in Mount Vernon in the \u2014 and parked\nthere in the park there, we sat down over there and I ask her, I says, look, would you\ntry to get more serious and thing? So we went \u2014 went around for a while. A serious\nthing, they called it steady that time. But my family wasn\u2019t too keen about her,\nbecause my wife has a \u2014 she talks a little loud, but she means nothing, but that\u2019s the\nway she talks and they couldn\u2019t accept her to \u2014 right away. But I saw in her a\ndifferent thing. I saw in her a smart, and knows what she\u2019s doing. And I saw in her\nthat we could have a nice future together, because I am not a businessman. I would\nbe very well off if I were to be a businessman. I\u2019m not a businessman type and she\nis. So she had \u2014 she was always a step ahead of me, whatever I wanted to do. So\nthen, when I was talking to my family, I says look, I says look, this girl who I\u2019m\ngonna marry, she has more than \u2014 than you think with \u2014 with all the things she says,\nwe \u2014 So they said look, it\u2019s your life and your decision, things like this. If she says \u2014\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecause I wanted \u2014 not that I wanted to get their permission to marry her, I just\nwanted they should give me \u2014 you know, to say look, I don\u2019t want to divide the\nfamily. And then they says, if you think so \u2014 so highly about her, we\u2019ll accept your\n\u2014 your knowhow, your thinking. And let\u2019s see, let\u2019s plan and see what\u2019s gonna work\nout. And we had our cousin, he was in the jewel business, and we\u2019re talking to him\nfor a ring. This cousin \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to buy a ring and she shou-shouldn\u2019t like it.\nBy the way, I already had 1500 dollars saved, which I was in the country two years,\nand that\u2019s a heck of a lot of money because I work so much overtime. And I wanted\nher to encourage that \u2014 like the cousin said, that she not gonna go hungry, so I\nwanted to encourage her, and I was working that time seven days a week and 10 -\n11 hours a day. I had a check of 250 dollar. I was working 70 cents an hour. So\nwhen we went to take out the marriage license that time, I had loose change, I says\nto her, I says, look, Bella, I don\u2019t have any change you could see, but I have my\ncheck, you cash it tomorrow, and you pay for the license, two dollar, which I tease\nher up \u2014 up to today I say, you paid for me. So she give \u2014 paid the two dollar, I gave\nher the check, and she saw the check 250 dollar [indecipherable] have to make\nover 300, 350 that time. And as saw the check, she was [indecipherable] right\naway, she says, gee, this guy makes a lot of money. Because people used to make\n60, 70 dollar a week that time, and I had 250 dollar, single guy. So I don\u2019t know if\nOctober 22, 1997\nthat impressed her to marry me, because she \u2014 she didn\u2019t care for money, never\ncared for money in general. So \u2014 but it \u2014 it helped, I wouldn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t help.\nAnd she \u2014 they took the check and cashed it, you know, and \u2014 and I says, you open\na bank \u2014 we \u2014 we were only talking about getting engaged. And she had the cousin\nthat he was in the jewelry business, and I had 1500 dollar, and then she picked out\nthe ring of 1200 dollar. So it\u2019s \u2014 were a little over a carat, a carat and a quarter,\nsomething like that. She picked out that ring, so I paid the 1200 dollar for the ring.",
        "A: I got married in June 1953. \u201953. \u201953. June 1953. I\u2014I had to think twice because I\ndidn\u2019t remember it\u2019s \u00b054 or \u00b053, but it was *53, June 1953.",
        "A: Well, first of all, we were talking a lot when we were engaged, about having a\nfamily together, how we should bring up the kids. I was not too \u2014 I was brought up\nin an Orthodox home, strictly Orthodox, to be, you know, to be \u2014 having really\nJewish faith. So when I got out of the camp, it \u2014 that \u2014 it cooled off a little bit, in\nOctober 22, 1997\ngeneral, for me. And she was \u2014 she was more religious, because my wife\u2019s family\ncomes from more a religious background. Not that my family didn\u2019t come, but it\nwas a different background because he had a brother, he was a shochet and some\nrabbis in the family. So she says to me, I want to bring up the \u2014 my children Jewish,\nthe real Jewish way. And like I was saying, we were very smart, in general, and I\nwent \u2014 I went along right away. The only question I says, where the heck you gonna\nget so much money? I says, there\u2019s nobody gonna give you here, you have to do it\nall wi \u2014 we have to do it all on our own. She says, we\u2019ll make it, God will help us\nand we\u2019ll make it. She also was telling me a story, when they \u2014 they build a school,\nthe Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck, and she went to visit there with \u2014\nwith the family there, where she was staying. And that was in the \u2014 probably in \u201946\n- \u00b047, when they build that school. So she says to the family, this is where I\u2019m\ngonna send my children. And she was telling me the story, so she says, I\u2019m gonna\nsend them in that school. And they \u2014 you know, they were very, very expensive\nschools, things like this. So she says, I\u2019m gonna work too. I says, how you gonna\nwork with small kid, thing like this. So she says, Pll manage somehow. She was\nworking bi \u2014 the year we had our son Jerry, but she was working in the dress line.\nShe was so good on that dress line that she became a sample maker. You\u2019re not\ngonna believe this, she worked til the day she gave birth. Like she\u2019s worked til five\nOctober 22, 1997\no\u2019clock and eight o\u2019clock was I took her to the hospital. And she was so good in\nthat thing, that where she was working, she had to go to the doctor every week or\nso, and this fellow by the dress line, he took her to the doctor, waited for her,\nbecause she was so good. And when she had the baby, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the fellow\ncame over to take the sample back, because she didn\u2019t even finish the sample. Now,\nwhen our ambition was very much to see how we could better ourself, and even\nhow to better somebody else\u2019s too, you know, with who \u2014 people you are together,\nlearn one from each other one. So for \u2014 we moved in an apartment, it was in the\nBronx. And it was [indecipherable] over there, it was in the dirt floor. And we\nwere \u2014 when I went to the hospital, I was so excited that my wife was sitting down,\nshe says, give me a glass of water, because we went to the hospital. I say why? The\n\u2014 the water busted. And I got such a bang I jumped up. I thought somebody hit me\nin the back. And when we got up she said, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t be scared. Th-The\nwater busted, we gotta go to the hospital She said, give me a glass of water\n[indecipherable] call a taxi. You think I could call a taxi? I didn\u2019t even know how\nto \u2014 I was so excited, I couldn\u2019t even call the taxi. And then she says to me, give me\na glass of water, I don\u2019t feel too good. Now who drank the water? I drank the water,\nbecause \u2014 and she said, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m gonna get my own water, because you can\u2019t\neven give me a glass of water. And then we went out, we got a taxi to go to Jewish\nOctober 22, 1997\nMemorial Hospital, and the guy didn\u2019t even know where Jewish Memorial Hospital\nis, the taxi driver, so she had to explain where it is. So I went into the hospital, went\nin there to the hospital. And by the time I turn around, I didn\u2019t do anything,\nsomebody comes by, she says it\u2019s a boy. Fast. And the next day I went back to\nwork, I went up [indecipherable] and the next day I went back to work. I brought\nthe kid home on third floor, but we couldn\u2019t \u2014 it was close to go to work for me, but\nit really wasn\u2019t a place to raise family because third floor. The neighborhood was\ngood, so we went to Crotona Park. They had a park there, they call it Crotona\npark. [indecipherable] So to get this apartment, we are now, we had to pay the \u2014\nthat time you had to pay \u2014 they call it the key money [indecipherable] you had to\npay. We paid a few hundred dollar to get this apartment. And then we \u2014 we had\nsomebody who knows in \u2014 in Yonkers. They lived in the \u2014 in Hilltop Acres, the\nplace was called Hilltop Acres. They lived over there and they says, 1-1-if you get \u2014\ngo there and you talk to the landlord in there probably, there\u2019s a lot of development\nthere, lot of apartment. And also you had to pay that time, too. So we give the guy\nsome money over there, he gives us a three room apartment over there. But that was\nnot right away, because it took time, and by the \u2014 by that time she was pregnant\nwith the second kid and \u2014 and on the same thing happened, but this \u2014 this \u2014 this\nchild was not born in Jewish Memorial, he was born in Bronx Levin Hospital.\nOctober 22, 1997\n[indecipherable] Bronx Levin on there. So we went to that hospital. I was a little\nmore calm, I had a little experience because it was two years. And when he was a\nfew months, second boy, we had that apartment, in which they called 90 si \u2014\nHilltop Acres, the number was 96. So we lived there for quite a while. And then I\nhad another child, it was also a boy. But the thing is, they all \u2014 they all were born \u2014\none was born June 17. My second child was born June 18. And I wanted to have an\nanniversary present, he should be born in June the 27\", so he stretched it til a\nminute past the 12 and he came June the 28\". So I lost out in that one. Then we\nwent to that new apartment, which it was in Hilltop Acres. And we had the three\nroom apartment. And soon this \u2014 the other one, they went to school. First they went\nto kindergarten and went to school, and my wife picked up something \u2014 something\nelse. She picked up real estate.",
        "A: Well, where she came \u2014 where my wife came to this cousin we \u2014 she called him\nuncle, but he was a cousin. His daughter got married and the doctor said she cannot\nhave any children. So she wanted to do something real important for those people.\nSo the first son was named after this cousin\u2019s father. His name is the \u2014 1-1s\n[indecipherable] English is the name Jerry. So he was named after his cousin,\nthink. Now, my second child I couldn\u2019t name after my father because the first name\nOctober 22, 1997\nmy father was Moishe Zev and \u2014 and \u2014 and my son\u2019s the f\u2014 name is Yehude(ph)\nZev, so I couldn\u2019t name any more after my father because my father\u2019s name, half of\nthem is by the first son. So my wife \u2014 so, I was talking to my family and I says,\nlook, I like to give a name and what can I \u2014 I can\u2019t name after my mother because\nit\u2019s not a girl. So we had a discussion and I talked to my wife. So my father \u2014 I\nnamed him after my father father, Shmol(ph) David also to be close, my father\nshould have a name. So this is the way I got the second name. And this cous \u2014 the\nfirst name always belongs to the wife, the second name to the man and if the third\none, it goes again to the wife. So the third name was Yithzak(ph) Shlomo(ph), and\nmy wife named him after her father and after a brother who also got perished in the\nHolocaust. So this is the way we picked the three names.",
        "A: Well, first of all, what I tell them, it\u2019s very hard to believe, but they only believe\nbecause the parents are telling them. I tried to tell them what happened with those\npeople, what happened if people are not united, if \u2014 what happened if, you know,\nyou don\u2019t trust each other. And even all those things you know, it \u2014 I was\npersecuted because I\u2019m a Jew and I hope you gonna keep up the faith and be a Jew\nbecause they didn\u2019t want you to be a\u2014 me to be a Jew, but I kept up the faith, and I\nwant you ke \u2014 people to keep up the faith. And they promise me they gonna do it,\nOctober 22, 1997\nand which they are doing it right now, which I\u2019m very proud of them, what they\ndoing. Soon my older boy Jerry, so soon \u2014 soon he was old enough to go to school,\nso he went to kindergarten for \u2014 he went to kindergarten in the regular public\nschool. And then like my wife, she kept her promise and she sent him to\nWestchester Day School for regular schooling. It was a quite a ride from \u2014 I lived\nalready in Yonkers, from Yonkers to Mamaroneck. And they said the only city in\nthe Westchester, they have no transportation. All the other cities, they have\ntransportation from one school to the other one, even private. So we had to get\ntogether people there and we had a school bus, we paid for the school bus. But\nsometime we had to go ourself and pick him up from the school [indecipherable].\nWhen my other boy was ready to go, we send him to the same school over there, to\nWestchester Day School on the - Mamaroneck, and also we did with the third\nboy, we send him to Westchester Day School til they graduated. Ma \u2014 but the third\nboy, when he was about a year old or so, my wife went to work with real estate, she\nbecame a broker. She took the kid with her, wherever she was going, because I did\nnot trust a babysitter. I never went to a movie while the kids were small, I never\ntrust a babysitter, because a boy, you know, they\u2019re a little on the wild side, and I\ndid \u2014 wherever I could entertain myself, I always used to take the kids along with\nme, in general. Matter of fact, there was one day they were playing cowboy that I\nOctober 22, 1997\nwas cowboy and Indian and I was so tired from working the seven days a week and\nI lay down one time in the afternoon. It was a Sunday, cause Sunday we only\nworked eight hours, so I came home and laid down a little bit. What happened, we\nwere playing cowboy and Indian and they cracked their heads on the radiator, we\nhad to go run to the hospital and put them all three stitches on. So that time I, for\nsure I didn\u2019t trust anybody to watch the kids, til they start growing up a little bit.",
        "A: Oh, we told them things, you know, make them understand what happened.\nAlso, I did not have to tell them too much because the schools, the Westchester\nDay School, they had classes for this and they explain it to them what happened on\nthe \u2014 it was much easier for me that somebody else told them, because I get very\nemotional to start talking again what happened.",
        "A: Yeah, after they explain it in their schooling, too. They used to ask if\n[indecipherable] my grandparents, where are my grandparents? So they \u2014 they start\nto understand why they don\u2019t have any grandparents, and why we were all alone.\nWith all the family, with all the friends you had, you had to make it on your own,\nwhatever it is. Even the \u2014 where my wife was staying [indecipherable] there was a\nlittle girl that time, she was 16 \u2014 15 years old, and my wife came out to meet me\nOctober 22, 1997\nsomeplace and I says, where are the children? And she says, I left them with the\nlittle girl. You know, I st \u2014I did not go into that affair \u2014 that affair, I went straight\nhome to watch the kids, and I send the girl home. I said, I don\u2019t trust nobody. And I\n\u2014] think it was some kind of a Bar Mitzvah, whatever, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 she made\narrangements, she was so \u2014 she worked so hard to get arrangement to have a\nbabysitter and I didn\u2019t trust them, so I missed that affair, because since they had the\nstitches on in the head, so that time I didn\u2019t trust them at all, til they grow up.",
        "A: They ask me \u2014 it was very interested, they used to came home and show me their\nreport cards, how good they are doing in school, which they, they were brilliant, all\nof them in school. So they came home with their report card, and they said they got\nstraight As, they got straight fives, whatever. So \u2014 fours \u2014 four were the best, they\nshow me five fours. So he ask me, my older boy Jerry, he says, Dad, four, you\ndon\u2019t say nothing? This the best. I say, you know how many fours I had when I was\nin school? So he say, yeah? You had so many fours? He goes over to his mother. So\nhe says, Mom, Dad had so many four, was he so brilliant in school? She says, no,\nall the four was failing, he failed every subject, he failed in school. Because what\ncan I tell a child from the school when I only made four grades? Four elementary\ngrade school. Matter of fact, I went five because the fifth one I \u2014 I went over the\nOctober 22, 1997\nsecond grade, I went over twice. How could you go in a school when they beat you,\nwhen you have a yellow \u2014 and th-the yellow stars came out that time, so it was very\nhard. But they went to their mother because my wife is more educated, she has \u2014\nwent to school over here, she was younger, and she was very good in Romanian\nschools ca \u2014 too, which I was very bad. So they never came around to ask me\nquestion about school and things like that, they always went to their mother and\nwith books, with all those things, she understood more.",
        "A: Yeah, we kept on \u2014 but a lot of time when I start explaining something, says\nyeah, we just had a class about Auschwitz, we just had a class about this, about this\n\u2014 this liberation, about this, whatever happened. So it was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so emotional\nfor me to explain them all those things, but they \u2014 they says to me, I will never\nforget the thing you went through, even I don\u2019t mention it, they said to me. So we\nhave very good relationship and the contact all the time, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they kept on asking me questions in general, how they took us away, and\nwho was there. I did not want to give them hatreds, you know, we \u2014 the Hungarian\ntook us away, to say the Hungarians did. I did not want to mention any nation in it. I\njust tell them, the thing was Nazi that time, from \u2014 from \u2014 control from the\nOctober 22, 1997\nGermans. And I say, of course there was a lot of col \u2014 colla \u2014 collaborators and\ndifferent kind of nations, so if you want me \u2014 they get together with somebody and\nsay oh maybe you killed my grandparents, they see somebody, so I didn\u2019t want to\nhave this to happen, I want them to find out a lot of thing their way, too.",
        "A: Well, they could have asked me more questions about the Holocaust things, but\nthey already know from the schooling, so there was really a \u2014 no a lot of things\nwhich they could have asked me. I wanted to hear it from them they ask me, I\nwanted to get in\u2014 more involved in thing they are involved. But they know it from\nother people, from other places they go. So they know what\u2019s going on, what\nhappened.",
        "A: It could be they didn\u2019t want to hurt me because they know \u2014 they know I\u2019m\ngoing through even now, emotional a lot of time. It\u2019s fi \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 look, it\u2019s \u2014 we are in\n\u201897 now, I got liberated in 1945. I still see what\u2019s going on, I still see everything in\nfront of my eyes. I still run to the windows, a lot of time I look out, I \u2014 did I really\nOctober 22, 1997\nliberated, and I really free? No \u2014 so they know how I felt about it, maybe they\nrestrain themselves in a lot of questions to ask.",
        "A: After the day school they finished in Westchester Day School \u2014 first I\u2019m talking\nabout Jerry. He went \u2014 he went \u2014 he wanted to continue with his Jewish education,\nbecause they were very, very good Jewish \u2014 and by the way, Jerry won the\nvaledictoria(ph) in Hebrew, he was so good in that Westchester Day School. So he\nwas making all the speeches in Hebrew that time. And from there he went on to\nYeshiva University, which is in Manhattan in Amsterdam Avenue. So he went in\nto that school and kept on his education in there. And of course, it looks like one\nson follows the other step, and it\u2019s three brothers, and they been raised so close, so\nthe same thing what happened with my other son, he finished the Westchester Day\nSchool and then he went to Yeshiva University. Well my third boy had a couple of\nmore years to finish Westchester Day School. It was very hard to travel out to\nWestchester Day School to pick him up, to bring him back for certain classes they\nhad. So we decided we gonna have to change school for him, to make it a little bit\ncloser to Yeshiva University. This way you pick him up, you pick them up all one\ntime. So there was a school, the [indecipherable] School. So we registered him\nover there, in [indecipherable] and he finished his two year there. He was so\nOctober 22, 1997\nadvanced from Westchester Day School that he always was ahead of the game in\nschool. Til \u2014 in there, there was no transportation at all, so we didn\u2019t have a bus like\nin Westchester Day School. So what happened in the morning? My wife, before\nshe went to the real estate business, she took them to school every day by day for\nyears and years and I picked him up at night, six, seven o\u2019clock, day by day, all the\ntime. This is the way they got their transportation back and forth. That\u2019s not all,\nsometime they had games, they had other thing, and I didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 you\nknow, to hold them back from anything, so we took them back at night, sometimes I\nfall asleep in the car waiting til they get out from the game, and this went on til they\nall finished, and they all finished Yeshiva University school.",
        "A: Well, I start working in this metal plant, and I was doing very hard work, you\nknow, like \u2014 like a plain labor or things like this. And this boss who hired me, after\nhe says he sees something in me, after a year or so, I was performing very good.\nUsually in that plant what they did is, if you were working a whole \u2014 a whole year\nwithout being out for any good reason, you used to get an award. I always got the\naward because I was never out. And my record was so great. So I didn\u2019t even know\nthis, this guy was an expert in \u2014 they both was an expert in metal. And he \u2014 one\nOctober 22, 1997\ntime he was watching me, I didn\u2019t even see him watching me. I was working\npiecework at that time, you really had to move. So he was watching me, and he\ncame over here, he came \u2014 I was speaking English already, with a Yiddish en \u2014\naccent. So he came over to me, he says, hey listen. I don\u2019t have a section head over\nhere, would you like to take over the section? Maybe 30 people in there. Me? Me? I\ndon\u2019t even speak the language the right way. How you want me to do something\nlike that? I don\u2019t even write, I can\u2019t even spell. He says, we\u2019ll give you a secretary,\nwe'll give you anything you want, just take over the area. He had 30 people in\nthere, I saw a lot of faults in that department, but I only mind my own business, I\ndid what I have to do. But once I was in charge, I shifted 10 people on the spot. I\nsays, I don\u2019t need these 10 people because this guy could do two jobs. Not to do\nsomething which is impossible, because what happened there, they put a line on,\nand when the one guy finished faster, he was standing around and doing nothing. I\nsays, Okay, you finish this and then you take the other area. And things like this, I\nshifted 10 \u2014 about 10 people approximately. And then they saw I was doing so good\nwith this \u2014 with thing, they had a meeting, the bosses had a meeting between them.\nThey said, let\u2019s make him a supervisor. Came around again with the same bosses,\nwith the same stories and I told them with the same stories, but I wasn\u2019t so much\nafraid for the \u2014 for being the supervisor because I had the section head already\nOctober 22, 1997\ntaking. I took over the job of supervisor on the \u2014 fine, of course, you get a hundred\npeople involved. And I was running back and forth and try to run the department.\nAnd I was so success 1n running the department, that we need more machinery.\nOkay, we need more machinery. I get machinery, so there\u2019s a lot of places where\nyou buy those machinery, those kind of things. Called me in, he says, you going to\nDetroit to buy a machine for this. I say, where\u2019s Detroit? What Detroit? So he\nexplained me, and he says, like I was telling you, we get you all the help. You could\ntake somebody with you if you want to, and you going to Detroit to buy the\nmachine. I went to Detroit, come back \u2014 that time, in the 50s, we paid almost a half\na million dollars for a machine, and I was trusted with so much money to buy the\nmachine. And put out the machine, I set up the machine, put \u2014 course, I had to learn\nthe business, I had to stay in Detroit for a week, two weeks, to learn the bi \u2014 to\nlearn the machine, the new type of machines. Put down the machine and business\nstarted booming again, started hiring more people and kept on going all over the\ncountry, I went all over the cun \u2014 Minneapolis, I went all over the country to get\nmachines. Matter of fact, there was another guy, a boss, he was of German descent,\nand that guy used to travel around too. He went to Germany, he bought a machine.\nHe says to me, Bernie, you going to Frankfurt? I says no, I\u2019m not going there. I\nsaid, I don\u2019t want to put my foot down there, I\u2019m not going there. He says okay, this\nOctober 22, 1997\nis part of the business. It\u2019s something you have to do, and if you won\u2019t do it, then\nwe gonna have a problem. So he says, take somebody with you. I took somebody\nwith me, I went to \u2014 to Frankfurt, I went to other places around there to buy the\nmachine, went back to the old places. And when I stepped down in the airport,\nFrankfurt am Main, I saw Nazis over there, you know, I see the \u2014 the picture\ncomes back to me. It was so \u2014 you know, in early 60s, it was something, you know,\nit come back to my mind. So I says to the guy, he was an Italian guy, I says to him,\nI say, listen. I don\u2019t want to touch a fra \u2014 a\u2014a mark, I don\u2019t want to touch anything\nhere. I\u2019m gonna buy something in the store which 1s made in any other country, and\nyou handle the whole thing. I do the negotiation, and you handle the whole thing.\nSo he couldn\u2019t handle it the right way, so I have to step in anyhow, because it would\nbe a problem. So after the meeting was there, and we bought the machines, that\u2019s\nalready came out for over a million dollar machines, came out the machines, so\nfinally they said stick \u2014 there was a Belgian guy at one who lived in Germany, so\nhe says, okay, we going out to eat in Frankfurt. I says, okay, we going out to eat,\nbut I want to tell you something. I only eat kosher. They all got stung because I \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t even know I was Jewish. So the other guy says, I don\u2019t even know\nwhere they have kosher places in here. So they told the secretary, she kept on\nlooking and looking, looking. Finally they find in the synagogue in Frankfurt,\nOctober 22, 1997\nthere was a Hungarian family that immigrated there, Jewish Hungarian. Matter of\nfact, she was from Hungary, he was from Israel. They opened a kosher place in\nthere. So they say, oh, we have a kosher place in there. So we were re \u2014 all went in\nthere and eat. Can you imagine that? Making all those Nazis eat kosher food? And\nwhen we went in there I said, that\u2019s not enough, I want to do something else too. I\nsay, you want wine? I say yes. Which I don\u2019t drink wine, once in a while. Well,\nactually [indecipherable] So, I says okay. So they bring out the best wine from\nFrance. | said no, no, no, no, no. I want wine from Israel, and I want to see the\nkosher mark on there. So they brought kosher wine and I had to make all of Nazis\ndrink kosher wine too, so I should get a little bit revenge of them. So we find out the\ndeal, we made up the deal, everything. Went back a few times there because \u2014 and I\nwent the same thing, the same thing what I said now, I never saw a mark and I\nnever touched a mark. And never bought anything except when I bought in the\nstores, I went in \u2014 I went in with the American dollar to buy, that time. And then\ncame home, we put up all those machines. And from the hundred people, g-grown\nto 250 people. The business was so booming, the whole plant had over a thousand\npeople. Business was so booming that we had to put in a night shift. So I was in\ncharge in day and night on the plant and the machine. Matter of fact, I got up, I\nwent as high as I became a metallurgent(ph) engineer. I know metal, I know it\nOctober 22, 1997\nanyhow, so I didn\u2019t go to school, but I recognize the metal anyhow, and I told them\nif it\u2019s stainless steel, if it\u2019s 1ron, how much iron is in there. So I became the\nmetallurgents(ph) engineer, and we hired people, new people. We hired a lot of\nItalian people because I speak the language and they were very good workers, so I\nwas leaning to the Italian people. And also I never forget what they did for me when\nthey told me Avanti, Avanti. So I never forget, which I have a soft spot for them. I\nwent back a few times to Italy and I have neighbors Italian, I speak to them Italian.\nBut there was one time I couldn\u2019t get any workers. They used to ask me, where you\nget those people? Do you go to the boat? Do you pick them up there? And so I\ncouldn\u2019t get any people, so they were \u2014 that time \u2014 Puerto Rico opened that time,\nand there\u2019s a lot of Puerto Ricans came in. And interviewed them, and of course\nthey didn\u2019t speak a word Engli\u2014 interview them. And before they start speaking\nEnglish, I learned Spanish, because they couldn\u2019t speak the language, so I had to\nlearn Spanish in \u2014 in the job there. So I was \u2014 I had about \u2014 about 250 people,\nmaybe more, in charge day and night of the oldest machinery. And I find I\u2019m\nworking over there 37 year in one place. I was that time in the union, and when they\nmake me all those big \u2014 big \u2014 make me all those proposal, they says, you have to\nstep out of the union, because you cannot be in the union and you cannot be a boss\nin the side. I came home and I told my wife, I said this and this happen, I could\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecame the vice-president in charge of manufacturing, if \u2014 but I cannot be in the\nunion. She says to me, look, you stay where you are. You \u2014 I don\u2019t need a title.\nYou\u2019re doing very good the way it 1s, don\u2019t leave the union. There was a lot of guys\nthat left the union, and it\u2019s true, they \u2014 they lost their jobs. And I was protected from\nthe union. So I was staying in the union. They \u2014 they had no choice, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to leave, so they left me the way it was, and the exemp \u2014 exemption to do\nsomething like this, to work for the boss, and to work for the union. Then is \u2014 the\nplant got bigger and bigger and I retired, and they take over the \u2014 some other people\ntook over the plant, and the plant went downhill, it took about 10 years. I\u2019m retired\nalready 10 years, and they took over the plant and they \u2014 they \u2014 they brought it\ndown and down and down. Finally they sold it, and \u2014 and they moved to Thailand,\nthe whole company moved to Thailand. So they dissolved the pi \u2014 dissolved\neverything over here. People were coming to me. I had some of the former bosses,\nthey begged me to go and restructure the whole thing, I mean, but I was not\ninterested to go back. I was, but my wife did not want me to go back. She says,\nenough is enough, so that\u2019s it.\nOctober 22, 1997",

And we could not get a contract bef \u2014 because we were a communist union,\nso they couldn\u2019t give us a contract. What we did, we went \u2014 a few people we got\ntogether and we went down to Manhattan, and we talked to the Teamster union, to\ntry to take over, we gonna throw this union out. Everything was a secret. And\nfinally we suc-succeed, we throw out the communist union and we got in the\nTeamster union, which it\u2019s up til \u2014 til the last days til they closed.

Secular harassment,\nyou know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a good movement with \u2014 also job opportunities, business\nopportunity, and a lot of whatever the change is, it\u2019s for the bettering, since I came.\nOctober 22, 1997\nAlso with the \u2014 used to be the pollution thing, when I worked in the plant, there was\nsmoked all over, and then they came in with the pollution thing, tried to protect\npeople, and it\u2019s getting better and better with all those things, which I\u2019m delighted\nto see that.\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Oh, I married in 1953. That where you \u2014 that\u2019s where I \u2014 I always wished I\nshould settle down and start living a normal life. Also was looking for the right girl,\nwhich everybody looks for the right man or the right girl, which I could say I find it.\nWe both fit in so much to each other like a pot with a cover. I was very honest all\nthose years, I\u2019m married for so many years. I had my fun in Italy, so I was very,\nvery devoted to the family, and very honest with my wife, on \u2014 pulling on the same\ntrack together, we never stepped out of line. Once you step out of line, you lose\neverything. So we educated \u2014 highly educated our kids. We worked really, really\nthe hardest way we could, we worked seven days a week, that she worked. There\nwas a lot of time she brought the kids home \u2014 when I brought the kids home from\nschool at night \u2014 all day she was working, and when I brought them home at night, I\ntook over and she went to work. She used to come home 10 o\u2019clock a lot of time\nfrom work. And we had to share whatever we had to do. We had to do the best thing\nwe can. We did when they went to the schooling, and we had also, the most\nimportant thing was the friends, with which friend you were going. Sometimes they\nOctober 22, 1997\nwent out with friends and we didn\u2019t like their friends, because their friends, they left\nthe kids with babysitters, 1t didn\u2019t work out. So we didn\u2019t agree with that, and the\nkids, after they finished the Yeshiva University, they decided they want to go to get\nthe profession, so decided he want to go to law. So Jerry started out, the first thing\nhe said he wants to be a lawyer. So my wife says to him, says look, I will support\nyou and your father will support you all means, all the way. But I want to tell you\nsomething, you gonna be a lawyer, I don\u2019t want a shysie(ph) lawyer in my family, I\nwant the best lawyer there is. If you cannot perform as the best lawyer, I don\u2019t want\na lawyer. But thank God he made it, and my wife got her wish, he\u2019s the best lawyer.\nSo my second boy, he came around, I ask him, what you want to do with your life,\nwhat you want to do for the future? So he says, I\u2019m gonna be a \u2014 a manager, some\nkind, industrial managing, things like that. I says to him, look, there are so many\nthing \u2014 so many people doing that kind of job, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna be\nsome kind of a future. But if you want it, I'll [indecipherable]. So then I find out he\nis interested to go in law. So he went into law too. And of course my third one\nfollowed the same step. What I could tell you one thing, that Iam very happy with\ntheir profession, and they\u2019re very established in the \u2014 in their way. By my \u2014 by\nJerry I have two grandchildren, and they\u2019re wonderful children. And my younger\nboy, he \u2014 he live \u2014 Jerry lives in Silver Spring, Maryland. And my younger boy,\nOctober 22, 1997\nwho married before my middle boy, he lives in Livingston, New Jersey. He has a \u2014\nJerry has a boy and a girl, and my younger boy Steven, he has two girls. One girl 1s\nnamed after my mother and my sister, the one I was telling you she died in the\ncamp, Hannah(ph) Esther. My other granddaughter is named through my wife\nfamily. And I wanted to have a name for my father so bad, so my younger son, he\ngave me the whole name, and I called him Moishe Zev. He doesn\u2019t even have an\nEnglish name, just Moishie(ph). That\u2019s the way they call him. He\u2019s also very \u2014 he\nsucceeds very much in his [indecipherable] in his \u2014 my younger one, he opened his\nown practice and [indecipherable] in a law firm. And my middle boy, we \u2014 he just\ngot married in November. He was waiting too long, he couldn\u2019t find what he wants\nto here. So finally he finds somebody, find a wonderful girl, and he married\nNovember 1996. And my \u2014 he \u2014 of course, no grandchildren over there yet. He is\ndoing very good doing the job in \u2014 in the law firm. They are very well established\nthemself, and thank God, they don\u2019t need any help from nobody, because they\u2019re\ndoing in their own. And I could say that I made it, what my aim was, my dream,\neverything came true the way. Of course, like I said, if you married, and you start\npulling different direction, you never make it. Once you stay together and you work\nout your problems together, you make it. I give you an example for myself.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: This is one of the greatest thing the younger generation are doing. I am amazed\nto see some people are putting in their life. Like Esther Finder who\u2019s interview\nme, she\u2019s putting in her life in that Holocaust thing. And that\u2019s all \u2014 whenever we\nget together, we ask about family first, the second word is about the Holocaust. And\nI\u2019m delighted. Also, she had a daughter \u2014 she has a daughter, she got \u2014 she wa \u2014 got\nBat Mitzvah. And we just saw the tape, and she made a speech, also mentioned the\nHolocaust. I tell you, even for so many years, we both \u2014 my wife was here too, we\nboth start crying, you know, to see. That\u2019s the third generation. So it\u2019s one of the\ngreatest thing people could do, to keep on passing from one generation to the other\none. And Esther Finder is a very good example, what she\u2019s doing.",
        "A: Holocaust?",
        "A: Oh, well, you know, you could \u2014 have to take those people serious, but they\ndon\u2019t know what they\u2019 re talking about anyhow. It makes no sense whatsoever. But\nyou have to put a stop to it because somebody else may believe something like this,\nand you have to prove that that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to search the Holocaust, to\nopen more museum, to open more things, to talk more about it and especially in\nOctober 22, 1997\nschool for the younger children, and not to let go. Just keep on reminding people\nwhat happened, because if you do that, it\u2019Il never gonna happen again.",
        "A: That\u2019s the way it starts. That\u2019s the way it start, this anti-Semitic thing, that\u2019s why\nyou have to put a \u2014 you have to put a stop right on the spot. Matter of fact, I just\nheard from Jewish [indecipherable] that there is some kind of inte-internet, they\nstart sending anti-Semitic things from the internet, one to the other one. All those\nthings gotta be stop. Soon something starts, you st \u2014 you have to stop it right away.\nYou don\u2019t let go, nothing. Take it serious.",
        "A: Well, we were \u2014 you see, we \u2014 we were born in the place, soon you were born,\nyou are independent, because there were so many children over there, you couldn\u2019t\ntake care of them. So you had to be independent in \u2014 in general. But once you went\nthrough this Holocaust life, you know, your experience was entirely different. You\n\u2014 you devoted more, because you see the tsoris you could get in if you do\nsomething in \u2014 and the wrong thing. So it \u2014 it influence a lot, and in the other way,\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something which I don\u2019t feel very well now, you know, you remember all\nOctober 22, 1997\nthose thing, it\u2019s tough, cramming you all the corners, you see all those thing. So \u2019m\nglad the way it turned out now, that I\u2019m happy.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very hard question to answer. I am a believer, but not the way they\nbelieving now, in that the ultra-Orthodox, like forcing children to accept something\nwhich they don\u2019t want to accept. I believe you, in Judaism, to God and to people.\nYou have to be for both. You don\u2019t have separate from the other, from anybody\nelse, just to be a Jew. You could be a good Jew, and \u2014 and \u2014 and do what you have\nto do not to be separated, that \u2014 dress different, go different, do other thing\ndifferent. I'll tell you, that caused a lot of anti-Semitic thing too, because the way\nyou separating with the thing. You could keep up your faith very well, like I do\nnow, for both ways, to people, and to God.",
        "A: See, the thing was this, when you \u2014 when you had your parents \u2014 first of all, you\nlost them very young, and the second thing, it was a different influence what they\ntried to do, 1t \u2014 with \u2014 with \u2014 first of all, what they \u2014 the parents those days was\nworried how to feed their children, which cause there was no food. Who to give\nOctober 22, 1997\nfirst? And it\u2019s a very interested thing, it was not in our house, but most of the\nhouses I saw, when they had a little food, who\u2019d they give first? For the father. He\nwas the head of the comm \u2014 on \u2014 on the he-head of the house. Everything the father\nfor, the \u2014 the kid could have suffered from hunger or diseases, first they take care in\nthe father, and that was the wrong thing to do.",
        "A: I tell you, if I would have listen to my wife, probably that we would never be in\nso much education, so many Jewish thing, because my wife was very highly\neducated. Even she was young, she was the best in school. And I saw so many good\nthings on her that she could do, and I left her do whatever she had to do, and she did\nthe right thing, and I\u2019m so delighted to see this thing what happened.",
        "A: Well, whenever we get together, you know, they live one apart, one from the\nother one, but if my middle son, which is Alvin, he doesn\u2019t live too far from me, it\u2019s\nabout 20 minutes or so. But how could you speak, they working so hard. They\nworking from early in the morning to early \u2014 late at night. But when there is a\nOctober 22, 1997\nvacation, we talk about it, because they all belong to the museum, they all\nsupporting the Yad Vashem, so they all involved in different ways.",
        "A: Well, we do \u2014 I did explain to my older grandchildren what happened with the\nschooling, with all this thing. So the \u2014 the thing was, it was a different world, and it\nwill never happen, this kind of world any more, so we have to do the best we can\nnow.",
        "A: All they did was certain \u2014 there was sometimes \u2014 they kept on questioning me\nwhy the \u2014 we have no grandparents, you know, even now, and what happened,\nwhere I was, especially my Auschwitz number is very visible, it\u2019s very big letters.\nSo sometimes they come over and kiss my arm, things like this. So they feel very st\n\u2014 very bad what happened with me and why I lost the whole family.",
        "A: I want them \u2014 they \u2014 they are \u2014 they are \u2014 they are very busy with schooling\nnow, but like it was mentioned before, I want them to get more involved in \u2014 in\nOctober 22, 1997\nthird generation Holocaust things with the museum, with all the other thing. But\nprobably they were left \u2014 they\u2019re gonna have a little free time. So we get together\nquite often, so \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I do speak. Matter of fact, I went to an affair and those people were not\nHolocaust survivor, and it \u2014 it \u2014 1t\u2019s something, you know, where you get together\nwith people, Holocaust survivor, after you talk a little bit, the Holocaust thing\ncomes up. So I was \u2014 we were talking about something, and this person comes over,\nthey says, we don\u2019t talk about Holocaust here, we having a simcha over here, we\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hear anything about it. There is some people like that, they\ndon\u2019t want to hear what happened, they\u2019re not interested.",
        "A: Well, the thing of it is, what you see, and \u2014 and what happened before, it\u2019s \u2014 1-1-\nit\u2019s so much different than one with the other thing. We never thought we gonna be\nfree, because we know we gonna be killed, or \u2014 or \u2014 or get killed. So either way, we\ndidn\u2019t have any hope to be \u2014 to \u2014 to live. And \u2014 and that\u2019s thing 1s still in our mind,\nthat we never gonna be free. I go up a lot of time at night and I look out of the\nOctober 22, 1997\nwindow and take a look where I am, how I am, and a lot of time when I go up, I\ncould bang in the \u2014 it happened one time I broke the glass from the \u2014 from the \u2014\nfrom the window, because I went out there and I knocked on the glass because I\nwanted to look outside, and it was dark, and I didn\u2019t see, and break the window to\nsee if I\u2019m really free, because it just an unbelievable thing that I am free.",
        "A: If I follow the \u2014",
        "A: Not too much, because I didn\u2019t know who they trying. Because we had no \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t read no newspapers, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t read because there\nwas not the papers we know how to read. So I just saw [indecipherable] what\u2019s\ngoing on, and then I find out about the big guys. The only trial I was follow very\nclose is Eichmann \u2019s because he was involved with [indecipherable] the Hungarian\nJew. And I was following very good, even they had a movie about it, so I was very\nmuch interested to see what happened, because a lot of thing I did not know what\nthis guy did. So I followed that thing close, which I know what the other things, the\nother one, I just heard about the names.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Yeah, justice was done, but the problem was, why was he caught so late?",
        "A: Yes, I followed it. So we all followed it when I was in Austria and Reidenburg,\nSalzburg, we did follow the whole thing, and due to the fact I am and I was and I\u2019m\ngonna be forever a real Zionist, and it interested me very much, every corner. They\nalso had a lot of film, like \u2014 they had one film like \u201cHill 24 Doesn\u2019t Answer.\u201d So I\nwas watching that movie a few time, matter of fact, I didn\u2019t even go out to see. And\nI \u2014 when I was with family there in Israel, they show me around the area, I ask\nthem where the fights was. I also, when we went for Tel Aviv with family to\nJerusalem, they [indecipherable] back and forth and they show me all the places\nwhere the Jordanian used to hide. And they shu \u2014 shoot down the thing. So I know\nIsrael very well, and I know every corner because I been there at least 20 times. So\nwe go very often there and \u2014 and our hearts, me and my wife is Israel and Israel\nagain. And it\u2019s one of the greatest things because I think Jewish people will never\nexist in this country without Israel and Israel will never exist without the American\nJewish. So it\u2019s something like one people, and we have to stick it together,\notherwise we will never survive.\nOctober 22, 1997",
        "A: Well, dis-dis-disappointment is when I came to this country, and it wasn\u2019t so\nrosy in the beginning and it was a very hard life to start, you know, without\nspeaking the language. It \u2014 it \u2014 1t was a terrible thing, which I kept on saying I want\nto go back to Italy. I speak the language there and I had a job with the government,\nItalian government. And there was a disappointing \u2014 soon I walked down the boat, I\nwas disappointed in my aunt, she didn\u2019t tell us the true, I would have be in Israel\nnow, where I belong; in the army someplace, being a general, who knows? And so\nit didn\u2019t work out with that, was a very big disappointment. What I am very surprise\nand very happy, I could tell you I succeeded. In this country I did made it, in\ngeneral, for one reason; because we pulled in the same direction with my wife. We\nmarried from 1953, and now is 1997. And of course everybody has a little quarrel\nback and forth, and I always back up, because I know she\u2019s right. So I always have\nthe last word, I say, okay, what do you want me to do? But she\u2019s a great lady in\ngeneral, and also she don\u2019t feel too good now, she has \u2014 arthritis developed in the \u2014\nin the camps. She doesn\u2019t feel good, a lot of problems she has, and she\u2019s talking to\nme, she says, you got \u2014 now you \u2014 look what you \u2014 you have yourself now, look\nwhat a wife you have. I can\u2019t help you too much, I can\u2019t do too much because I\nOctober 22, 1997\ndon\u2019t feel good. My only reply was, I don\u2019t see you the way you look now, I only\nsee you the way I met you, and to my eyes 1s the way I know you and the way\nyou\u2019re gonna stay. So you know what she said to me? Why don\u2019t you get \u2014 change\nyour glasses? That was the reply. Which I wear no glasses anyhow.",
        "A: I\u2014 what I like to accomplish, I\u2019m accomplishing. Traveling from one son to the\nother one, going to Israel and make sure my wife feels good, make sure I could do\neverything to help her, because bothers her, a lot of thing. And whatever I do now,\nI\u2019m very happy in general, and my happiest \u2014 second happiest thing 1s \u2014 was the\ngrandchildren, the family, and then when we go to Israel. Like I said, we go every\nyear, and we see so many friends over there. And I\u2019m just delighted to see the way\nthe country is growing and \u2014 and they cannot say now like they used to say, in\nRomania used to say, hey Jew, go to Palestine; hey Jew, you don\u2019t belong here.\nNow we are there where we belong.",
        "A: Well, I only want them to know the way we are and I don\u2019t want them to think\nthat I came from the big family, you know, very important people. I came from a \u2014\nfrom where I came. Came from a \u2014 we were very poor, it was a very poor place\n100October 22, 1997\nfrom where I came, I want them to know that. I also want them to know the\nhardship I went through, and I want them to know that my success, they should take\na example from me, why \u2014 why you success in life. And you stick \u2014 when you want\nto do something you stick to it, and help each other and I want to see close family,\nlike Iam with my sister and my brother now. To me the \u2014 this is the most important\nthing, cousins, whatever it 1s, just stay close, get in contact with each other, call\neach other. And that makes my life.",
        "A: This book, what you just mentioned, it\u2019s very, very interested to me. Why? He\u2019s\ntelling the story exactly what happened. And it \u2014 very interested that this man went\nthrough the same thing that I went through, and by reading all this thing of what he\nwent through, I remember a lot of things. One thing, I was working ina\u2014ina-\u2014ina\nmine on \u2014 on a stone mine, we were working in the mountains there, and I didn\u2019t\nknow what the heck they were doing there, the German. In the book I see they were\ntrying missiles there. The German were trying the missile, the V-2, whatever they\nmake. And there was other thing. A lot of marsh \u2014 marches we went, and we didn\u2019t\nhave any direction. So he says in the book, we \u2014 we marched a death march to\n101October 22, 1997\nnowhere. I didn\u2019t know [indecipherable] we were going there. And there was a lot\nof areas I didn\u2019t know the distance from one place to the other one, he\u2019s telling me\nwhere. It\u2019s something I keep on reading and reading, keep on reminding. It\u2019s one of\nthe greatest book a man could ever write, especially the \u2014 the thing which I went\nthrough.",
        "A: Yes, I was in the same camp from the beginning. First of all, he\u2019s starting up\nwith his life in Poland someplace where he was before they send him to\nAuschwitz. And from there where he picks up the Auschwitz til the liberation, it \u2014\nit\u2019s exactly what I went through, because he was in the same camp. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\nreminds me the thing, a lot of thing, which I couldn\u2019t remember. Like I was\nworking when they had that mine working in there, in the mountains in there. And I\nwas working for somebody there, for a German guy, a civilian guy, I didn\u2019t know\nhis name. He puts 1t down in the book, what the guy\u2019s name was and it was very\ninteresting to me to see it, which I have a copy and I treasure it very much.",
        "A: Well, it was very hard for me to give this interview, because it takes me back,\nway back what happened. It\u2019s not gonna be easy for me to forget all those thing,\n102\nOctober 22, 1997\nbecause sometime it takes months to get over this thing, because it brings you back\na lot of memories, which \u2014 what happened, and you get so confused now, after you\nfinish. There\u2019s a lot of thing I really forgot. I didn\u2019t cover everything what I wanted\nto say, because there\u2019s a lot of thing I forgot. So whatever I remembered, I said it,\nand I hope this thing will go out to schools and to other places. They should hear\nwhat happened, and they learn from it. And maybe if there is any problem like the\nskinheads or the other thing, then those kids will say no, no, I heard it from a\nsurvivor and I don\u2019t believe what you say, because it\u2019s not so, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really the\ntruth that the Holocaust existed, which we all know that.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\n"
