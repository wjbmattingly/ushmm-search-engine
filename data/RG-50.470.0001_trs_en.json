We didn't understand\neverything they said, but they were saying like, long live\nour president, I don't know, which banish[?] or something\nand it was a lot of going on you know. So we all went to\nthe windows, but it was dark you couldn't see much. But the\nday break was still trains coming through with prisoners,\nnow the communication wasn't like nowadays, you hear\neverything you see everything. There's a lot of people\ndidn't know that the war came to a, to a end, and their were\nfreight trains coming through with German guards standing on\nthe, in on the steps, and we hollered to the prisoners, the\nwar 1S over, you're free, but they were so numb that there\nwas not, not even a reaction from those people. And\neventually some people start coming in, men with their\ncolored arm bands, you have it around your arm you know, it\nwas saying police or something, they just came up overnight,\nand they were taking off the German guards out of the trains\nand taking their weapons away. And I think they became\nprisoners, and then they were marching through. But that,\nfor a while, that just didn't make any difference, because\nwe still didn't have any food, people were kept dying from",
        "dysentery, from sicknesses, there was, I wouldn't, you\ndidn't know if you have to feel joy or what, you were just\nmore or less so dehumanized that some people were happy,\nsome people were just staring, I mean there waS no, no-no\nfeeling like you get hijacked or something and so, and then\nyou get liberate [laughs] after six years, there was, you\ndidn't know what happened to your family or, why you're here\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

We had to get\nmarried by the military personnel to make it legal. So you\nknow, here is a, over there was a little different, you\nknow, if you had a baby you should get married, so this guy\nlook you're not married and you got a two year old son you\nknow it was terrible.

But we\nOriginate the whole thing, and uh, they was real nice\nbecause people show up from all over, you know, like there\nwas a camp, and there was like the only only thing going on\nthat night is a wedding, and everybody came in, th- it was\nlike, here they call it a covered dish, we didn't cook,\neverybody brought some food and fruit and people bottles\nwhiskey and drinks and all was, unsolicited, that was real\nlike a community project and then the music",

When he came\nin the podium was uh uh, you know like you got a horse and\nwagon, we just got a wagon, he got up on that and he spoke\nyou know and his hair was flying in the air he one\ntoo clear and goes to, he spoke I forgot what he was saying\nand that was a, everybody came to listen, and so I remember\nit.\nSWB: What did it mean, was it very important to how\neveryone felt?\nBUD BRODECKI: Well it was important because a lot of us\ndidn't really have a desire to go back from the countries we\ncome from because it was a lot of anti-Semitism, it was bad\nmemories. So everybody was kind of looking toward Palestine\nwhich was Israel. Anda lot of people uh uh took off\nillegally, mostly immigrants at the time going to Israel\nwere illegal, you might have maybe exodus, some of my\nfriends were on it. I was so sure I made a second attempt\nto leave. But my wife was expecting a baby, and we went to\nMunich and we had to also play Greeks or Italians because\nthat's the only people were allowed to go in that direction",
        "you see so they give a false documents to justify where\nyou're going you know we should keep a march .\nAnd due to the conditions at the time, nothing ever went off\non schedule, like I went over there and they postponed it so\nI, Munich wasn't too far from Landsberg so I came back, so\nfinally my neighbors attacked me, he said enough single boys\nyou're gonna leave your wife here, pregnant wife and you're\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

Matter of\nfact, we visit Israel in 78 and they made us a party the\nsame group which I was going to live with toured Israel. So\nthen I was left behind in Landsberg and to finish that story\nwe went to Munich and we register everywhere to immigrate to\nAustralia to Canada United States different places so we got\na letter from Richmond that we were accepted in the Richmond\ncommunity and that's how we came about [laughs] wind up in\nRichmond.\nSWB: Was the camp decorated for Ben-Gurion?",

What happened with Colonel\nHeymont, I wasn't aware of his existence, I think he was\nreally short time in Landsberg, but what happened, you know\nwhat my son did last few years, he was the national campaign\ndirector for the Holocaust museum, and he met him. He even\nwrote a book, and that's where I find out about his\nexistence because in those days,\nSWB: You didn't know.\nBUD BRODECKI: I didn't know, I had no idea.\nSWB: Tell me again the story of when you were in the public\nbaths after the liberation and when everyone sort of forgot\nthey were naked and started looking for people who\u2019 knew\nwhere their families were.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/10/95 Int.

We didn't know\nwhy, but we were used to take orders [laughs] so we turned\nto the wall. All of a sudden we heard voices and a bunch of\nwomen came in, of course most of them had their heads shaved\nand nobody was looking human in those days you know like you\nlook at a man he got like a triangle just going down\nto the camp, walking skeleton. And somehow somewhere some\nboy recognized someone, you know, from which town I couldn't\ntell you the detail. But then everybody start turning\naround and looking, if you, you see all of us were\nseparated, from families, from sisters, from mothers, from\nbrothers, so we didn't know what was going on, I didn't know\nwhat's on the other side of the wall during the war. All I\nknew 1S we were getting some, some places the Germans had\nbig loudspeakers and they were playing military music and I\nnoticing that they just sunk another American submarine\nsomewhere in the Pacific or Atlantic.
