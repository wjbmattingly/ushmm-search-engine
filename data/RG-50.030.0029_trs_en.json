        "Q: Mr. Blau, could you tell us your name please?",
        "A: My name is B\u00e9la Blau.",
        "Q: And, Mr. Blau, where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Pressburg [NB: German name], in Pozsony [NB: Hungarian name], in\n1910, in the time of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy--later Bratislava.",
        "Q: Could you tell us a little about Bratislava from your early memory?",
        "A: Bratislava is one of the really wonderful city, beautiful cities along...next to the Donau,\nRiver Donau [NB: the Danube]. And as most of...like everyone likes his hometown. I\nwas grown up there, went to school there; and uh lived there 'til my...'til I was twenty-\nseven, when I married and I left Bratislava to live in another uh city--in _ilina, in the\nnorthern part of Slovakia.",
        "Q: OK. During uh these early years, tell me a little about your parents and the family that\nyou grew up in.",
        "A: Yeah. My father was a furrier. And I was the eighth child in the family; so that means a\nbig family. We went through the First World War. This was very hard time. When I was\nfive years old, I had to still get up early--five o'clock in the morning--and stand in the\nqueue to get bread or milk, or whatever was available. It...I started to go still in the\nHungarian schools. Then later on...and actually later in...in the grade uh nine and ten--\nwhat you could call here nine, uh grade nine and ten--I went to, in a commercial Schule\n[school]. That's a school...and had my education mixed German and Hungarian. When I\nwas sixteen, I started to uh...I went as apprentice in a business to be trained as a\nsalesman. And it was a textile business. I worked there from 1926 'til 1930. Then I was\ncalled up to the army for the service. I did my eighteen months. After eighteen months\nservice, I started to work as a commercial traveller [NB: a salesman], which I did \u2018til uh\n1942--with certain interruptions, because I was representing the firma...the company\nAGFA, photo company. And in 1938, I was dismissed because of my Jewish origin. After\nthat, I had different jobs--whatever I could find to feed my family--because I married in\n1930 uh...37, in January. We had a son in November [1937]; and in...(cough) we lived\nthis time already in _ilina where I was travelling around a lot. We choose _ ilina as a point\nto live because that was more or less in the center of the country, my region.... How you\ncall it? Where...where I had to work, and I could be more often with my...with the family.",
        "Q: And if we were to think now about the time when the war broke out, could you tell us\nyour memory of the actual beginning of the war, as it affected you and your family?",
        "A: The first uh...that was already before the war, that I lost my job. And the second thing\nwas affected me personally is, when the new Slovakian state was established we was\nthrown out from our apartment what we had in a quiet uh good uh neighborhood and had\nto move out in the outen [NB: outer] uh reg...region of that...of the city. So this been\nactually only everything personally. Then I had different jobs and worked around. Then\n...when the...the day-to-day life naturally was always full of uh fear and uh...tension;\nbecause every...every night or every day, when you heard somebody walking by under\nyour window, you never knew if he is coming to pick you up or what...what is he will.\nWhat is tense, the way if the sound of the steps will stop in front of you, or if they are\ngoing further up. So in...1940, 1941, we been once picked up from the Hlinka Guard to\ntaken away to be deported. Through some unknown uh reasons, we been...after a few\ndays we been released, and we came back. But before, when we been taken in...in the\ncamp, in these camps where there are concentrated uh people, they took away half our\nbelongings. Which...which we didn't get back when we have been released, naturally. So\nthat made our lives even again very hard, because no income but needs was here. So we\nstruggled through 'til the second uh time. One day after Yom Kippur in 1942--it was the\n21st or 22nd of uh September--a knock on the door for two men in civil clothing, two\nmen in the...in the Hlinka Guard uniform. \"You have a half an hour time. Pick up your\nbelongings and follow us.\u201d So they took us to the camp where we arrived. They let us\nstay in in front of the office on the camp. I didn't know what 1s going on inside, because it\nwas a big excitement. After a while, a man came out with a bundle of uh papers which\nlater ... which I found out later was the list of the deportees, every where going\nforty...forty names of every list. So when he came out, he said, \"Take your belongings\nand follow me.\u201d And the train was already prepared, standing there not far away...about\nhundred twenty, hundred fifty meters away. That was a small railway station. \"Go up!\"\nAnd a few minutes after that, the doors was closed. Yeah, and they put into every\ncarriage they put in a list. One man was the responsible for the order in the ...that special\nwagon in which, how I mentioned before, forty people was uh...only forty people.\nBecause they from other countries, from Poland and from France, and from\nGreece...there came up to hundred twenty, hundred fifty forced in. So we had a very\nluxurious uh travel comparing to them. So when the door was closed, I went to the man\nwhom I know and ask him, \"Let me see that uh piece of paper what you got. Give it to\nme.\u201d So I saw forty names typed with a typewriter; and during the forty names, five\nnames was uh...four names was crossed out, and our four names--I myself, my wife, my\nson and my mother-in-law--put in with pencil. That was the machination of that people\nwho run the camp; and they been the real collaborators. And they got what they deserved.\nBecause then in 1944, they came to Auschwitz where some of them have been thrown\nagainst the electric wires and some of them have been killed by the inmates, just who\nremembered what they have done. So we ca...we arrived in Auschwitz. The usual uh\nselections: women and children and olderly [NB: elderly] on this side; Arbeitszwang,\nhow they called it--the people who was able to work--on this side. So these people went\nto the gas chambers, and we went to the uh camp. I don't know for what reason we have\nbeen registered in a different place like the usual. We been taken straight away in a\n[Struhutstamm (ph)] [to] Lager Auschwitz, where we got a shower. We had to throw\neverything on a heap. Our luggage we had to leave on the on the ramp in the railway...in\nthe railway station. And...somehow, I don't know what happened, they said everybody\ncan keep his shoes. Anything else...not socks, nothing. Only shoes. And I got, after the\nshower what we got...they didn't gave us any towels. They gave me a shirt which was two\nnumbers too small. So 'til I was working myself into that shirt, I had my shoes between\nmy legs. I got from somebody, from one of the old Haftlings who had\nsomething...something to work there, a push. I lost my balance. He grabbed my shoes and\nran away. And I knew very well the shoes are life there. So again by accident, I had still\nmy watch on. I don't know why I had still my watch on. A Polish man, I know his name.\nThey called him \"Bogdan.\u201d He was working in the Politisch Abteilung [Trans: \"Political\nDepartment\" |--that was the Lager Gestapo. And he told me, \"Give me your watch.\u201d I told\nhim, \"Listen. I give you my watch, because I know what is going on. But I see you have\nto...1t seems to me that you have here some kind of a influence. That what did happen\nwith my shoes. Bring me a pair of shoes.\u201d So he did. He did. So when we was uh...we got\nthe normal stripped clothes, and we was taken to our barracks. This time we was uh\nplaced in the Barrack number 10. This Barrack number 10 has... has a special history;\nbecause there used to be woman in that barrack, and later on it was the experimental\nblock again--the same block. Next to 1t was a block--Block number 11--which was the\nexecution block. And the windows on the Block 10, in between Block 11 and 10, was all\nuh covered up, boarded up. We could sometimes peep through little space with little\ncracks and...and see what is going on. So I been this uh block a few days when the\nfirst...shock was big naturally. The first even bigger shock came when one when one of\nthese uh Kommandos--in which one of my friends went out--came home, and they\nbrought him home dead. That was about the fourth or maybe fifth days...day what we\nbeen there. So I started to ask questions: how did that that fellow uh was killed.\nWhat...what has he done? So, nothing special; only his Polish Vorarbeiter [Trans:\n\"foreman\" or \"gang boss\"| came to him and said, \"Listen, if you promise me that you'll\ngive me your ration in the evening then I will keep you alone...uh, leave you alone. I\nwon't uh beat you.\u201d And he sometime...he get got angry. He had still a little bit\ncour...courage. And lifted his spade against that fellow. He was a prisoner, too. And\nnaturally that was [in|subordination. A few German colleagues of his saw. So they beat\nhim to death with the spades. That was...and a few different...uh, similar experiences,\nwhat I... what we went through in the first day. The endless standing and Schikanieren\n[NB: chicanery] what they had. Twelve o'clock in the night they woke us up: \"Alles\nandrehen!\" For say the \"Appell,\" for no reason whatsoever. Sometimes they...they\nchased us down to the...the front of the building. Sometimes they let us stand for hours in\nthe rooms that we're standing next to our beds. And...so, like naturally everybody had to\nwork. Nobody could and should stay at home without special permit. If somebody was\ncaught up in the camp from SS man or from anybody who ask him, \"What you are doing\nhere in...in the camp during the day?\" When you didn't have the proper excuse, it was\nfinish. Straight away into the Block 11 this times; and the next transport, crematorium.\nRegardless your health, stand [NB: state] of health, or whatever. So I...we worked in\ndifferent uh Kommandos, different work places...",
        "Q: What kind of work place were you assigned to?",
        "A: In uh in one stage I was uh working in one group with that builded uh...build a bridge\nabove the River So_a. That was a tributary of the uh River Wis_a. Vistula, if you heard\nabout these names. That they planned there a bridge, a wooden bridge. My first job to\ncleaning the big pine trees from the uh...to clean it up that the [people (ph)] should be\nabsolutely clean. That was my job. And how with a spade, just to scratch it. And later I\ncame their building company...company. That was the Un...later on, it was the Union uh\nammunition factory out of it. I started to dig the foundations. And the German Kapo, who\nwas a [kaminlog (ph)]-- somehow because I spoke a very perfect German, he talked\nsomehow to me. And he talked me in, because he was more or less analphabet, you\nknow. You know what...illiterate. Illiterate. So I did the writing jobs for him; and he\nlooked so far after me that he organized for me clean clothes. That was something what\nsaved later--in a few weeks later--my life, when we are coming to it. I worked there with\n'til about beginning of January of '43. One evening, we are marching in from the...from\nwork. I was already quite weak from three month nothing. Just the exact rations, and no\nsource sometime...somewhere to get something extra. We marching through...through the\ndoor; and we uh...SS is standing at the door and screaming, \"All the Jews to the parade\n...to the parade place.\u201d The Appellplatz, where they.... That never sounded very well, but\nwhat we had to do? We went there. We didn't know what the reason was. And one of the\nKommandofihrers--[Stibbitz (ph)| was his name--came and started to count and sort out\nfrom these...I don't know how many thousand people...uh, and put and told them, \"Go\nhere. Go here.\u201d And he came to me, and I was the last one. Looked at me and told me,\n\"Oh, you look quite good. You uh...you.... Du bist gut aus.\" -- \"You look quite well.\u201d\nUh, and that I was the last one. \"Turn left. March!\" I didn't know where. And it turned\nout that was the Kommando Kanada where I was uh uh assigned to. So next day morning,\nwe marched out. We went to Kanada. We saw what is going on. We could get some food,\nchanged underwear...",
        "Q: Let's go back just a moment. You say you saw what was going on. What was going on?",
        "A: It was going on that...that all the effects, all the effects from the people who came with\nthe transport was brought to us and we had to sort them out. And what was uh uh useful\nfor them, that was sorted out and sent everything to Germany. We had daily a few\nwagons of different type of uh goods which went to Germany. I, for instance, I was\nworking in a magazine. I packed the spectacles, the glasses, the cutlery, the...the shaving\nbrushes and differents...these small things, in big baskets. I don't know if you remember\nthese old pleated travel baskets from heavy...from heavy uh cane. So we had to pack\nthem full, close them up. I had to write on \"KL Au,\" which mean KL Auschwitz, the\nnumber what...what was on the [to goes (ph)| would be the papers, wind it...wind strings\naround it, and up it goes. Hundreds and hundreds of these baskets with uh brea...with uh\nspectacles, with everything--items what I mentioned before--went there. So when\nsomebody is coming today to Auschwitz in the museum, and sees a heap of uh spectacles\nand shav...shaving uh uh brushes, he thinks whatever. But that was only a ver...that 1s\nonly a very, very small percentage of that what went, that effects we went through. So, in\nbeginning of 19...1n about mid-April in 1943, I got typhus. So naturally I didn't went in\nthe beginning to the so-called hospital; and I went every day to work with ninety degrees\ntemperature. That was three kilometers there, three kilometers back. Maybe a little bit\nless. You know, actually...I'm sorry. I am mistaken. It was less; because this time uh the\nKommando was still in Auschwitz. And...wait a minute...I have to rectify myself.\nSomething is wrong. End of January, one day when we went from the Kommando instead\nto go to back to Auschwitz, they turned us to the right and they took us to Birkenau.\nWhich was...that was more than three kilometres coming in. We went to Auschwitz. We\ngot the uh...we been relocated there. We had to come everyday these three kilometers\nfrom and to, to work. And then happened that I got the uh typhus, and with ninety degree\nI had to walk this three kilometers every day, now and back. In about end of May '43,\nsomething...I can't remember exactly what happened in the Kommando. And uh our\nHauptscharfuhrer, who was our uh supervisor there, took us--about five or six of us--\nbrought out from one of the magazines the heaviest fur coats what he could ever find.\nThe heavy Russian fur coats, what the Russian peasants used to wear in winter. The\nlambs wool. I mean, sheeps...sheepskin, not lambs' wool. Sheepskin. Such a coat was at\nleast five, six kilogram heavy. That's means ten, twelve pound; and that was a very, very\nhot day. I had ninety degrees. And he commanded us to \"make sport\"--that was express\nwhat they used. Run, lie down. Up, run, up, run...and so on. He did it with us one hour\nlong, the whole so-called lunch time. Naturally, I was extremely exhausted after that\nwhen we finished. So I went uh...I said I can't go back to the next day; so I went in the\nevening to the so-called \"Revier\"--Krankenbau [NB: the \"sick bay\"]. So when I came\nthere, I saw the Krankenbau is nearly empty. And a friend of mine who was working\nthere said, \"The Krankenbau was taken to the gas chambers yesterday. You have a few\ndays time. You can rest here.\u201d So I had been there about five or six days. The\nKrankenbau filled up, so the danger came always closer. I decided to tell him, \"Listen,\ncheck me out from here.\u201d What he did; and really the next day the whole Krankenbau\nwent to the gas chambers. Again a brush with death. So I came uh out, back to the work\nforce. How you say it? And for some reason, they didn't want to do...to take me back to\nthe Kanada. So I started again and going out for manual work. And then...just a moment,\nI remember now something which was before what was actually the reason from...for that\nwhat they made the sport. I had a friend in uh...in Birkenau who was a dentist. And I had\none of my tooth hurted, so I went to him he should pull me it out. So I wanted to uh show\nmy appreciation for it. So I brought him a little bit of a...of Tabak, cigarette Tabak [NB:\ntobacco] what I found in the Kanada. And on the way back, they let us...undressed us,\nnaked, and they found the cigarette. And for that I got a two month...two months in the\nStraf company [NB: Strafkommando = \"punishment brigade\". The Straf company is\nthe...everybody knows what a straf company...company is. So it was very hard. When we\nwork, our work was there. We was digging uh a channel to...to let off the water; because\nthat was swamp area, a canalization. And we was digging it to the...down to the banks of\nthe Vistula, that it shouldn't be the...the terrain should be dry, the possibility to dry out. I\nwas working up 'til here in mud. On the end of the work, my colleagues had to pull me\nout; because by myself, between the cane what was going there, I would never came out\nby myself. Only with help. I did it...to our good luck, we...we have been released for\nsome reason not in two months [but] after six weeks. So I came out. So I turned to a few\nfriends for help. So they helped me a little bit--here a piece of bread, here a little bit\nsomething to eat, something else. And naturally that was the time when we came back to\nworkforce. Meantime, I had already a few people whom I know. So I started to work; and\nagain thanks to my knowledge in German, I got different uh jobs more or less...at least\npart Schreiber [Trans: \"scribe\"]. And now I work, say two hours; and two hours I\nworked in one small Kommando as Schreiber. In the afternoon, again I worked two\nhours, and went two hours this so-called clerical work. So that...what I made my life a\nlittle bit easier; because as a reward for my Schreiber work, I got a little bit of a soup\nextra from the kapo of that Kommando. Then...one of my...a friend of mine, he get...uh\ngot a position in the Kanada Kommando. He some...somehow was uh promoted there.\nAnd I go...go to...went to him, and told him, \"Listen.\u201d Uh, Carl was his name. \"Say, Carl,\ncan you do something for me? Look how I am. Look how I look. I would need a little bit\nto recover. Take me back to the Kommando.\u201d \"Oh, yes, I will arrange that you are\ncoming tomorrow to the Kommando.\u201d So I have been there a couple of weeks; and some\njealousy and intrigues started against that man who brought me back. So say\nthe...the...the Haftlings, the prisoners, uh claimed that I was working for him. That mean,\nI was stealing goods from the Kommando and carrying it for him. It wasn't true. The only\nthing what I ever \"organized\"--that was the slang expression for stealing--I organized\nonly food. For myself, and for a few friends for whom I could help with what I brought\nhome. I could share with them. So it went so far that they started to uh work against me.\n'Til one day, one of the fellows came to me and told me, \"When you are coming\ntomorrow morning to work, you are not going home.\u201d So naturally I didn't came. This\ntime a new Kommando started to...came in existence. Our job was to dismantle airplanes\nwhich has been shot up around that area, regardless German, English, American. And I\nbefriended myself with that kapo. I knew him from before. We worked always...already\nsometime together. He knew about my knowledge of the German language. So I started\nthere as a Schreiber. We started there with about a hundred uh prisoners, and slowly it\nwas built up to about thirteen hundred. So the responsibility was quite big, because we\nhad to have very exact evidence--every single number who was in the Kommando. In one\ncase, I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape. I don't know if they\nsucceeded or...or not. But the fact was they didn't came in to the camp. Big excitement.\n\"Schreiber from [zelligbatterie (ph)], nach voraus!\"--\"To the front to the gate. Give me\nthe numbers uh from these two men who are missing.\u201d I didn't have that on me. I turned\naround to go back; and I saw my assistant was already running behind me waving the\npiece of paper where the two numbers have been written down. Because that what\nhappens in the morning before we went out. Every group of twenty had to be...uh\ntheir...his...their numbers had to written down on a piece of paper. And they had to be\ncompared during the day, if he was yesterday in at work or not. So a lot of uh\nunnecessary scribbling. But he...so he came. He gave up that piece of paper to the SS in\nthe front. They look at that are the numbers. \"Hor auf!\" That mean, \"Disappear!\" So we\nwent back with no consequences whatsoever for us, because we been right. If I couldn't\nhave produced the two numbers, that would be the end of...of me. So I just want to\nmention that what uh kind of job and what...what the...what uh dangers in there...have\nbeen there everyday. Every moment was dangerous. Having a assistant this time, the new\ntransport arrived on the same uh track where we got the wagons where we unloaded the\nremnantses [sic] and the raw material from the planes. The aluminum and every usable\npart was uh sorted out. The old aluminum what went in the mills or 1n the factories, that\nwas recycled. So...and sometime on the same track came new transports. And in the\nKanada, they had the duty...when a transport came, they had been on the ramp; and when\nthey threw away their belongings, they had to collect it, pick it up and throw it on the\ntrucks which took them to the working place of the Kanada. But they been quite\nexperienced already to sneak out where is something to eat. So one of my friend--his\nname was [Juri (ph)] Fried. I don't know where he exists today, and looking for him in\nIsrael now when I've been there; but I couldn't get any uh news about him, where he\nexists. So he...I have to mention that on the end of this place where the newcomers has to\ndisembark from the train was a little hut. I went there when I saw from afar that the\ntransport is coming. So I went there, hide myself in the hut; and LJuri (ph)] Fried came\nwith...always with bags full of food. I was staying there and waiting 'til everything was\nover with, 'til the ramp was empty. So I took my harvest what I had and went back to the\nmain Kommando. And here in one day I had a quite a good harvest. I called up all the\nKapos. I had uh twenty-six of them; because thirteen hundred people...every hundred had\ntwo kapos. I called them up and told them, \"Listen. I want your sticks what you are using\nto beating the people.\u201d Very big surprise. \"What is this?\" \"You are getting from me food\nfor it. I don't mind if you have a small vine from some of the bushes here 1n your hand.\nBut the big heavy ones I want to have, because I need it as heating material for I will let\ncook for you something to eat. I have the raw material.\u201d So that was one of my biggest\ndeeds, in my opinion, what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners. 'Specially\nI didn't know everybody personally. But if only one was saved from two or three uh hits\nthrough a day, that was already something. So slowly, slowly they got used to it; and the\nbeating let up. Screaming, yes. Screaming doesn't hurt to anybody. So then one day in\nAugust 19 uh...44, we been on the march home uh from the.... We worked on Sundays\ntoo. Coming uh home, coming in front...one of my duties was to arrange the hundreds\nthat they should be at the long march. We had about nearly four kilometer march, and\nthirteen hundred people are walking tired. They are not walking like soldiers. So in front\nof the uh came about hundred fifty, two hundred meters--and that was exactly opposite\nthe Lager C where my wife used to be this time. And I stopped there, without looking\nback what is going on behind my back. Just at that moment, I saw a group of girls\nstanding there around. I didn't know how they came there, what they did there. And\nduring the time I was ordered...making that order, the SS man who was in charge in front\nof the camp in a wooden barrack, he called my wife in. \"Come here.\u201d She went there. She\nmade the procedure that uh how she had to report. And that...and he was drunk. He\nhardly saw (laughter)...and he hardly knew what he is doing. And asked her, \"Do you\nhave a boyfriend?\" She was surprised about that question, and said, \"No, I haven't got\none.\u201d And he asked, \"Why?\" \"Because nobody wants me,\" she said to him. And he said,\n\"I will take care that somebody should want you. The first man who is passing here by,\nthey had to want...have to want you.\u201d So the first one who came by was myself. So he\ntold me, \"Talk to her!\" So, naturally, on her number I recognized right away that she is a\ngirl from Slovakia. And uh, naturally, I ask, \"What is your name? What...where are you\nfrom?\" And about one or two such trivial questions. When she said, \"I can't talk like\nthis....\u201d\u2019 To the SS man. \"I can't talk to this...to a man whom I never saw before like this\non the street. And except [NB: besides], he has other duties to do.\u201d And he said, \"Yes,\nyes. You are...you are right.\u201d He called me. \"Come here!\" I told him, \"Yes, what you\nwant?\" He said, \"Tomorrow morning you are reporting here. And you have to come to\nthe camp.\u201d And to her, she [NB: he] said, \"You will be here in the morning, and you will\nstay here in the window. And when he cames, you will write his number in in the book.\u201d\nBecause everybody who came in or out was registered in a book, to keep it very exact\nand clear. So with that episode finished in that moment. So I, I did my job further; and I\njoined to the last five people who went in uh... went into the barrack. So straight away,\nwhen I came in, I went to my close friend, Erich Kulka--who is now here as a historian,\nhe just recently got his doctorate for something--with whom we are still in good\nfriendship. So I went to him. He was one of the maintenance men in the camp, and one of\nthe few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different camps, when if something was\nbroken down he was the man who had to repair it. He was working there as a engineer.\nThey call in English \"engineer,\" but a Schlosser [Trans: locksmith, mechanic or fitter]--\nhe was a fitter, or something like this. So he...I knew that he went quite often in the\nwomans camps, too; and I knew that he knows Magda. So I went straight to him and\nasked him, \"Listen, Erich. What is your opinion about Magda? Do you know her?\" \"Yes,\nI know her very well.\u201d \"And what is your opinion?\" He said, \"I will tell 1t to you in one\nsentence. (Pause-choking up) She is one...she is one of the few woman or persons here in\nthe camp who manage to be still human.\u201d I mean, I couldn't ask for a better information.\nSo I started to run around; I organized again a...a bottle of schnapps. Because that was\ndefinitely the best uh currency between SS and Haftlings what you can imagine. Better\nthan today the American dollar or the Fren...or the Japanese yen. So I got it through my\nconnections. The next day in the morning, really, I went in. When I came to the gate, I\ntook out from under my arm where I have hidden the bottle, put it on the window. And\nreally Magda was there. She write down my name. I mean, we didn't have names. Uh, my\nnumber; and uh so I could go in. She was very uh embarrassed. She...because she wasn't\nexpecting that I will come. But for curiosity, I wanted to find out what is going on,\nwanted from her certain in...information. So we went in. She was running away, hiding\nsomewhere. After few uh time...because in after short time, we met. We had uh the\nopportunity to talk a few words. So when I uh came in her room, because as in her\nfunctions she had the right to have a small room which was about two by four meter big.\nThat her own...she had her own bed. And when...when I saw her belongings, the few\nbelongings what she had. So she reminded me somehow of my wife. And later on she\nwas uh still very uh embarrassed, and a little bit out of shape; so she turns, she had a\nsmall mirror there hanging on the wall. She went there and started with her fingers to\narrange her hair. When I told her, \"Listen, it is quite a few years that I saw a woman\nstanding in front of a mirror and getting, combing on her hair.\u201d And that somehow\ntouched her, too. I was very touched, and she was very touched. And that somehow\nbrought us close. Closer. And in the next few weeks, now and then I asked permission\nfrom my Oberkapo that he let me one or a few times to go and visit her. Just harmless\ntalk, because everything else was dangerous. And it was because the fact was, I didn't\nwant to be somehow too much uh interested; because when you are not uh.... I don't\nknow how you said that. Fallstrick [Trans: pitfall, trap]. When you are not careful\nenough, it can can bring you in trouble; and that is what we... nobody needed. So the\nwhole relationship, all the time what we went in, was absolute platonic. So the time went\nby. I saw her about five or six times. And I started to like her; because I saw what she's\ndoing, how's she's doing, how.... And I knew her reputation in the camp. Because\neverybody knew all about her, everybody in the men's camp knew about her and knew\nabout her deeds--what she is doing and how she is doing. She had a wonderful reputation\nin the...1n the camp. And naturally I was very much impressed with that. And later on,\nend of November or so, '44, some difficulties started on in my Kommando. I had that...I\nwas already one and a half years there. So she arranged somehow that I could join to a\nsmall Kommando which came regularly every day to her camp to do some maintenance\nwork. There was a small magazine. There been a small, uh a few old sewing machines. It\nwas our duty to clean them and bring them to shape. But we always was talking and\nnever did real, some real work. So then came the 18th of January [1945]. The 18th of\nJanuary was the day when the death march from Auschwitz started. So we, we...uh we\nmarched late afternoon from Birkenau. We was taken over to Auschwitz. I tried to hide\nthere, to stay there what maybe I hoped. But then the rumors went around [that] the\nwhole camp is undermined, that there exist a plan that camps uh will be bombarded from\nall sides with artillery and with the planes, to make it to disappear. And...but still I went\nup in one of the blocks. I was very tired; because the whole day, we...the stress. We had\nto \"antrehen, abtreten, antreten, abtreten\" [report, get dismissed, report, get dismissed |\nabout five or six times during the day. So I went in one of the blocks which was already\nempty. I hide...I hid myself under...in one of the beds, and I fell asleep. Around midnight,\nall of a sudden I am woken up from the absolute quietness what was in the la...what was\nit in the camp. And I was very curious what is happening. So I went down, opened the\ngate; and in that moment two of my friends with whom I used to work together in Kanada\npassed by. They saw me. They say, \"What you are doing here?\" \"I want to stay here. I\ndon't want to...I have enough. I tried....\u201d \"No, don't stay here. That will be blown up\neverything. It is dangerous. Come. Come. We are going. Come with us.\u201d So I went. So I\ndid it, that death march. We walked through uh three uh nights, days and nights. And in\none intersection we collided with the woman. We came from ...from a different...they\ncame from a different way than we. And the woman, they looked for men. The men\nlooked for woman, if somebody's there. Relation, friend or something. The woman... the\ngirls went to the SS woman asking for permission, if they could give them a permission\nto talk to us; because somebody recognized me there from one of her friends and told that\n\"Bela is there. Try what you can do.\u201d But meantime a big crowd started; because such a\nmass of people, two or four SS woman or men couldn't keep uh back even if they would\nstart to shoot or whatever. So they started a big crowd; and we somehow came close to\neach other and we spoke a few words, and then...to each other. And I told her, \"Listen.\nWe are now in a Situation we know the war can't keep very long any more. So if we are\ncoming home, I want to meet you.\u201d And she told me, \"Ah! Who knows how we will\nmeet?\" I...we...somehow we been so uh used to that not to have names but we had only\nnumbers. But I wasn't thinking on it that when we are coming home and we will be\nregistered somewhere that I won't register under names, but under numbers. And I told\nher, \"Listen. I tell you...look when you...when you are coming home and you are coming\nhome, look for my number.\u201d \"Oh, I never will remember your number.\u201d \"You will. I will\nexplain to you how.\u201d And I showed her: \"Listen. I have 65066, is my number. Your\nnumber, 2318. These your four numbers are included in my five.\u201d She asked how. I said,\n\"Look, 5 - 6- 11 - 12 is 23. Three 6 is 18. Simple as that.\u201d You know? Good that we\nhaven't been registered, thank heavens, on the numbers but on the names. She came some\nwhere in East...to East Germany. I came to Mauthausen. I was in one month in\nMauthausen, 1n the so-called quarantine. Naturally, when we arrived we been\nuh...stripped what we had. I had relative good clothes. And in my pocket--to our bad\nluck, Magda got from a woman from Bratislava a check to the uh...to one of the English\nbanks. I don't know where that woman had transferred before the war big money from\nBratislava to that...I think it was the Barclay Bank. I am not sure any more. And that\nwoman came to Magda one day and told her, \"Listen. I see what you are doing here. I am\na very rich woman. We have a lot of money in...in uh England, and all over the world. I\nhave a little chance to survive. I am older than you. Maybe you will survive. As a\ngratitude for that what you are doing here, I give you that check of thousand dollars,\nthousand pounds.\u201d And when we met on that place what I mentioned before, she [NB:\nMagda] told me, \"You are a man. Take that check to you. Maybe it is safer with you.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it worked out if it would stay with her she could keep it. I couldn't;\nbecause when we came to Mauthausen, they stripped us. They stole all our uh better\nclothing what we had. And I didn't had...I wasn't thinking on it; and even if I would think\nit on it to take it out from my pocket, I had not the where to hide it. It was written on a\nthin paper. If I put it in my mouth, it would be dissolved; and go through the shower and\nsave it, such a piece of paper.... So.... But I honestly admit, I wasn't even thinking on it.",
        "Q: You were then in Mauthausen until what time?",
        "A: In Mauthausen, we been about one month.",
        "Q: And after that?",
        "A: From Mauthausen, we was taken over to Gusen,. which been an ammunition factories,\npartly. And Gusen I and Gusen II was uh factory...one of the factories was the\nMesserschmitt uh Werke, for the Messerschmitt planes--war planes. So I was uh\nassigned. Because when they asked my profession, I told them I am an engineer. I\nthought it doesn't do any harm not to be a laborer, or a accountant or a doctor or a\nsolicitor, whatever. So, OK. So they registered me as an engineer; and when it came to\nthat uh Gusen II needed people, they sended us there. And I was assigned to work in the\npart to uh fix the petrol tanks, the gas tanks, in the uh wings of the Messerschmitt. I don't\nwhich number was it-- 87, or the 111. I don't...can't remember anymore. But we didn't do\na lot of work, because we didn't got any raw material.",
        "Q: OK. If those were the final days of the war, how did the liberation come to your camp?",
        "A: On the first of May; and to tell that when we got up in the morning, and instead to take us\nback in the Messerschmitt uh factory, they took us to a place in the name Gunskirchen.\nThat's supposed to be one of the new camps in that area which Hitler in his fantasy and in\nhis dreams thought he will keep the last resistance 'til his [wonderritens (ph)] will be\ncompleted. And he can uh resist there in that area ad infinitum. But this camp was in the\nbeginning stadion [NB: stages]. That it what was a camp the Germans put in middle in\nthe forest a big uh saw machine, driven with a...uh petrol engine. They cut off the trees,\nput it on the machine, made boards out of it and [brewed (ph)] the bark. When we came\nthere it was the First of May. Accident...accidentally, I remember the day exactly;\nbecause on the way, when we went on the...uh road, a old uh Wehrmachts man who was\ncalled up--he was this time about fifty--started to talk with me, and he still believed that\nHitler will win the war. It was the First of May '45. So...so when we came in...in the\ncamp, the barracks wasn't ready. No windows, no doors and no roof. The roof was only\nthe main pillars; but empty in between, so that water, snow, everything could go through.\nLuckily the rain stopped just a few days before we.... And the nice, very nice spring\nweather started.",
        "Q: Excuse me, but at that time who...which army liberated you?",
        "A: American.",
        "Q: The American Army.\nSubcamp of Mauthausen.\n* Another subcamp of Mauthausen located in Austria. From his subsequent description, it is clear\nthat he was sent to the Waldwerke I section of the camp.",
        "A: American.",
        "Q: How did you first see them come in?",
        "A: I didn't saw them at all. I just heared...heard them. I mean, in the beginning uh.... It was\nthe 7th of May in the afternoon. I was wandering around in the camp; because in the\nsame camp atrived a lot of Hungarian uh men who came from the Don and from the\nDnieper. From these area, from deep in uh...in Russia. And from the Ukraine, there came\na forced march. And being Hungarian, and I had relatives in a certain township in\nHungaria [Hungary]. So I went around in the hope that I will find somebody whom I\nknow. So I went in one of the barracks; and a fellow came out. And I ask him, \"I hear uh\npeople from Szombathely....\u201d That is the place where I had an uncle. And I knew...know\nhe had four sons and three daughters, or whatsoever. And somebody told me, \"Yes, there\nare here. Whom you think?\" I said, \"I would like now if one of the Blau boys are here.\u201d I\ncouldn't tell the name, which of them could be, because there are four boys. He told me,\n\"Yes, they are here. One is here.\u201d \"Where is he?\" Indeed I ask. I...he looked back. \"Yes,\nhe's coming here. That is him.\u201d So we came, we started to talk a few words with each\nother. Because I never saw him in my life before. One of his brothers I knew, his father I\nknew, one of his sisters I knew.... Because this time from Bratislava to Hungary to travel\nwasn't so easy. And uh only by very special occasions could somebody come over.",

        "A: My name is B\u00e9la Blau.",
        "A: I was born in Pressburg [NB: German name], in Pozsony [NB: Hungarian name], in\n1910, in the time of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy--later Bratislava.",
        "A: Bratislava is one of the really wonderful city, beautiful cities along...next to the Donau,\nRiver Donau [NB: the Danube]. And as most of...like everyone likes his hometown. I\nwas grown up there, went to school there; and uh lived there 'til my...'til I was twenty-\nseven, when I married and I left Bratislava to live in another uh city--in _ilina, in the\nnorthern part of Slovakia.",
        "A: Yeah. My father was a furrier. And I was the eighth child in the family; so that means a\nbig family. We went through the First World War. This was very hard time. When I was\nfive years old, I had to still get up early--five o'clock in the morning--and stand in the\nqueue to get bread or milk, or whatever was available. It...I started to go still in the\nHungarian schools. Then later on...and actually later in...in the grade uh nine and ten--\nwhat you could call here nine, uh grade nine and ten--I went to, in a commercial Schule\n[school]. That's a school...and had my education mixed German and Hungarian. When I\nwas sixteen, I started to uh...I went as apprentice in a business to be trained as a\nsalesman. And it was a textile business. I worked there from 1926 'til 1930. Then I was\ncalled up to the army for the service. I did my eighteen months. After eighteen months\nservice, I started to work as a commercial traveller [NB: a salesman], which I did \u2018til uh\n1942--with certain interruptions, because I was representing the firma...the company\nAGFA, photo company. And in 1938, I was dismissed because of my Jewish origin. After\nthat, I had different jobs--whatever I could find to feed my family--because I married in\n1930 uh...37, in January. We had a son in November [1937]; and in...(cough) we lived\nthis time already in _ilina where I was travelling around a lot. We choose _ ilina as a point\nto live because that was more or less in the center of the country, my region.... How you\ncall it? Where...where I had to work, and I could be more often with my...with the family.",
        "A: The first uh...that was already before the war, that I lost my job. And the second thing\nwas affected me personally is, when the new Slovakian state was established we was\nthrown out from our apartment what we had in a quiet uh good uh neighborhood and had\nto move out in the outen [NB: outer] uh reg...region of that...of the city. So this been\nactually only everything personally. Then I had different jobs and worked around. Then\n...when the...the day-to-day life naturally was always full of uh fear and uh...tension;\nbecause every...every night or every day, when you heard somebody walking by under\nyour window, you never knew if he is coming to pick you up or what...what is he will.\nWhat is tense, the way if the sound of the steps will stop in front of you, or if they are\ngoing further up. So in...1940, 1941, we been once picked up from the Hlinka Guard to\ntaken away to be deported. Through some unknown uh reasons, we been...after a few\ndays we been released, and we came back. But before, when we been taken in...in the\ncamp, in these camps where there are concentrated uh people, they took away half our\nbelongings. Which...which we didn't get back when we have been released, naturally. So\nthat made our lives even again very hard, because no income but needs was here. So we\nstruggled through 'til the second uh time. One day after Yom Kippur in 1942--it was the\n21st or 22nd of uh September--a knock on the door for two men in civil clothing, two\nmen in the...in the Hlinka Guard uniform. \"You have a half an hour time. Pick up your\nbelongings and follow us.\u201d So they took us to the camp where we arrived. They let us\nstay in in front of the office on the camp. I didn't know what 1s going on inside, because it\nwas a big excitement. After a while, a man came out with a bundle of uh papers which\nlater ... which I found out later was the list of the deportees, every where going\nforty...forty names of every list. So when he came out, he said, \"Take your belongings\nand follow me.\u201d And the train was already prepared, standing there not far away...about\nhundred twenty, hundred fifty meters away. That was a small railway station. \"Go up!\"\nAnd a few minutes after that, the doors was closed. Yeah, and they put into every\ncarriage they put in a list. One man was the responsible for the order in the ...that special\nwagon in which, how I mentioned before, forty people was uh...only forty people.\nBecause they from other countries, from Poland and from France, and from\nGreece...there came up to hundred twenty, hundred fifty forced in. So we had a very\nluxurious uh travel comparing to them. So when the door was closed, I went to the man\nwhom I know and ask him, \"Let me see that uh piece of paper what you got. Give it to\nme.\u201d So I saw forty names typed with a typewriter; and during the forty names, five\nnames was uh...four names was crossed out, and our four names--I myself, my wife, my\nson and my mother-in-law--put in with pencil. That was the machination of that people\nwho run the camp; and they been the real collaborators. And they got what they deserved.\nBecause then in 1944, they came to Auschwitz where some of them have been thrown\nagainst the electric wires and some of them have been killed by the inmates, just who\nremembered what they have done. So we ca...we arrived in Auschwitz. The usual uh\nselections: women and children and olderly [NB: elderly] on this side; Arbeitszwang,\nhow they called it--the people who was able to work--on this side. So these people went\nto the gas chambers, and we went to the uh camp. I don't know for what reason we have\nbeen registered in a different place like the usual. We been taken straight away in a\n[Struhutstamm (ph)] [to] Lager Auschwitz, where we got a shower. We had to throw\neverything on a heap. Our luggage we had to leave on the on the ramp in the railway...in\nthe railway station. And...somehow, I don't know what happened, they said everybody\ncan keep his shoes. Anything else...not socks, nothing. Only shoes. And I got, after the\nshower what we got...they didn't gave us any towels. They gave me a shirt which was two\nnumbers too small. So 'til I was working myself into that shirt, I had my shoes between\nmy legs. I got from somebody, from one of the old Haftlings who had\nsomething...something to work there, a push. I lost my balance. He grabbed my shoes and\nran away. And I knew very well the shoes are life there. So again by accident, I had still\nmy watch on. I don't know why I had still my watch on. A Polish man, I know his name.\nThey called him \"Bogdan.\u201d He was working in the Politisch Abteilung [Trans: \"Political\nDepartment\" |--that was the Lager Gestapo. And he told me, \"Give me your watch.\u201d I told\nhim, \"Listen. I give you my watch, because I know what is going on. But I see you have\nto...1t seems to me that you have here some kind of a influence. That what did happen\nwith my shoes. Bring me a pair of shoes.\u201d So he did. He did. So when we was uh...we got\nthe normal stripped clothes, and we was taken to our barracks. This time we was uh\nplaced in the Barrack number 10. This Barrack number 10 has... has a special history;\nbecause there used to be woman in that barrack, and later on it was the experimental\nblock again--the same block. Next to 1t was a block--Block number 11--which was the\nexecution block. And the windows on the Block 10, in between Block 11 and 10, was all\nuh covered up, boarded up. We could sometimes peep through little space with little\ncracks and...and see what is going on. So I been this uh block a few days when the\nfirst...shock was big naturally. The first even bigger shock came when one when one of\nthese uh Kommandos--in which one of my friends went out--came home, and they\nbrought him home dead. That was about the fourth or maybe fifth days...day what we\nbeen there. So I started to ask questions: how did that that fellow uh was killed.\nWhat...what has he done? So, nothing special; only his Polish Vorarbeiter [Trans:\n\"foreman\" or \"gang boss\"| came to him and said, \"Listen, if you promise me that you'll\ngive me your ration in the evening then I will keep you alone...uh, leave you alone. I\nwon't uh beat you.\u201d And he sometime...he get got angry. He had still a little bit\ncour...courage. And lifted his spade against that fellow. He was a prisoner, too. And\nnaturally that was [in|subordination. A few German colleagues of his saw. So they beat\nhim to death with the spades. That was...and a few different...uh, similar experiences,\nwhat I... what we went through in the first day. The endless standing and Schikanieren\n[NB: chicanery] what they had. Twelve o'clock in the night they woke us up: \"Alles\nandrehen!\" For say the \"Appell,\" for no reason whatsoever. Sometimes they...they\nchased us down to the...the front of the building. Sometimes they let us stand for hours in\nthe rooms that we're standing next to our beds. And...so, like naturally everybody had to\nwork. Nobody could and should stay at home without special permit. If somebody was\ncaught up in the camp from SS man or from anybody who ask him, \"What you are doing\nhere in...in the camp during the day?\" When you didn't have the proper excuse, it was\nfinish. Straight away into the Block 11 this times; and the next transport, crematorium.\nRegardless your health, stand [NB: state] of health, or whatever. So I...we worked in\ndifferent uh Kommandos, different work places...",
        "A: In uh in one stage I was uh working in one group with that builded uh...build a bridge\nabove the River So_a. That was a tributary of the uh River Wis_a. Vistula, if you heard\nabout these names. That they planned there a bridge, a wooden bridge. My first job to\ncleaning the big pine trees from the uh...to clean it up that the [people (ph)] should be\nabsolutely clean. That was my job. And how with a spade, just to scratch it. And later I\ncame their building company...company. That was the Un...later on, it was the Union uh\nammunition factory out of it. I started to dig the foundations. And the German Kapo, who\nwas a [kaminlog (ph)]-- somehow because I spoke a very perfect German, he talked\nsomehow to me. And he talked me in, because he was more or less analphabet, you\nknow. You know what...illiterate. Illiterate. So I did the writing jobs for him; and he\nlooked so far after me that he organized for me clean clothes. That was something what\nsaved later--in a few weeks later--my life, when we are coming to it. I worked there with\n'til about beginning of January of '43. One evening, we are marching in from the...from\nwork. I was already quite weak from three month nothing. Just the exact rations, and no\nsource sometime...somewhere to get something extra. We marching through...through the\ndoor; and we uh...SS is standing at the door and screaming, \"All the Jews to the parade\n...to the parade place.\u201d The Appellplatz, where they.... That never sounded very well, but\nwhat we had to do? We went there. We didn't know what the reason was. And one of the\nKommandofihrers--[Stibbitz (ph)| was his name--came and started to count and sort out\nfrom these...I don't know how many thousand people...uh, and put and told them, \"Go\nhere. Go here.\u201d And he came to me, and I was the last one. Looked at me and told me,\n\"Oh, you look quite good. You uh...you.... Du bist gut aus.\" -- \"You look quite well.\u201d\nUh, and that I was the last one. \"Turn left. March!\" I didn't know where. And it turned\nout that was the Kommando Kanada where I was uh uh assigned to. So next day morning,\nwe marched out. We went to Kanada. We saw what is going on. We could get some food,\nchanged underwear...",
        "A: It was going on that...that all the effects, all the effects from the people who came with\nthe transport was brought to us and we had to sort them out. And what was uh uh useful\nfor them, that was sorted out and sent everything to Germany. We had daily a few\nwagons of different type of uh goods which went to Germany. I, for instance, I was\nworking in a magazine. I packed the spectacles, the glasses, the cutlery, the...the shaving\nbrushes and differents...these small things, in big baskets. I don't know if you remember\nthese old pleated travel baskets from heavy...from heavy uh cane. So we had to pack\nthem full, close them up. I had to write on \"KL Au,\" which mean KL Auschwitz, the\nnumber what...what was on the [to goes (ph)| would be the papers, wind it...wind strings\naround it, and up it goes. Hundreds and hundreds of these baskets with uh brea...with uh\nspectacles, with everything--items what I mentioned before--went there. So when\nsomebody is coming today to Auschwitz in the museum, and sees a heap of uh spectacles\nand shav...shaving uh uh brushes, he thinks whatever. But that was only a ver...that 1s\nonly a very, very small percentage of that what went, that effects we went through. So, in\nbeginning of 19...1n about mid-April in 1943, I got typhus. So naturally I didn't went in\nthe beginning to the so-called hospital; and I went every day to work with ninety degrees\ntemperature. That was three kilometers there, three kilometers back. Maybe a little bit\nless. You know, actually...I'm sorry. I am mistaken. It was less; because this time uh the\nKommando was still in Auschwitz. And...wait a minute...I have to rectify myself.\nSomething is wrong. End of January, one day when we went from the Kommando instead\nto go to back to Auschwitz, they turned us to the right and they took us to Birkenau.\nWhich was...that was more than three kilometres coming in. We went to Auschwitz. We\ngot the uh...we been relocated there. We had to come everyday these three kilometers\nfrom and to, to work. And then happened that I got the uh typhus, and with ninety degree\nI had to walk this three kilometers every day, now and back. In about end of May '43,\nsomething...I can't remember exactly what happened in the Kommando. And uh our\nHauptscharfuhrer, who was our uh supervisor there, took us--about five or six of us--\nbrought out from one of the magazines the heaviest fur coats what he could ever find.\nThe heavy Russian fur coats, what the Russian peasants used to wear in winter. The\nlambs wool. I mean, sheeps...sheepskin, not lambs' wool. Sheepskin. Such a coat was at\nleast five, six kilogram heavy. That's means ten, twelve pound; and that was a very, very\nhot day. I had ninety degrees. And he commanded us to \"make sport\"--that was express\nwhat they used. Run, lie down. Up, run, up, run...and so on. He did it with us one hour\nlong, the whole so-called lunch time. Naturally, I was extremely exhausted after that\nwhen we finished. So I went uh...I said I can't go back to the next day; so I went in the\nevening to the so-called \"Revier\"--Krankenbau [NB: the \"sick bay\"]. So when I came\nthere, I saw the Krankenbau is nearly empty. And a friend of mine who was working\nthere said, \"The Krankenbau was taken to the gas chambers yesterday. You have a few\ndays time. You can rest here.\u201d So I had been there about five or six days. The\nKrankenbau filled up, so the danger came always closer. I decided to tell him, \"Listen,\ncheck me out from here.\u201d What he did; and really the next day the whole Krankenbau\nwent to the gas chambers. Again a brush with death. So I came uh out, back to the work\nforce. How you say it? And for some reason, they didn't want to do...to take me back to\nthe Kanada. So I started again and going out for manual work. And then...just a moment,\nI remember now something which was before what was actually the reason from...for that\nwhat they made the sport. I had a friend in uh...in Birkenau who was a dentist. And I had\none of my tooth hurted, so I went to him he should pull me it out. So I wanted to uh show\nmy appreciation for it. So I brought him a little bit of a...of Tabak, cigarette Tabak [NB:\ntobacco] what I found in the Kanada. And on the way back, they let us...undressed us,\nnaked, and they found the cigarette. And for that I got a two month...two months in the\nStraf company [NB: Strafkommando = \"punishment brigade\". The Straf company is\nthe...everybody knows what a straf company...company is. So it was very hard. When we\nwork, our work was there. We was digging uh a channel to...to let off the water; because\nthat was swamp area, a canalization. And we was digging it to the...down to the banks of\nthe Vistula, that it shouldn't be the...the terrain should be dry, the possibility to dry out. I\nwas working up 'til here in mud. On the end of the work, my colleagues had to pull me\nout; because by myself, between the cane what was going there, I would never came out\nby myself. Only with help. I did it...to our good luck, we...we have been released for\nsome reason not in two months [but] after six weeks. So I came out. So I turned to a few\nfriends for help. So they helped me a little bit--here a piece of bread, here a little bit\nsomething to eat, something else. And naturally that was the time when we came back to\nworkforce. Meantime, I had already a few people whom I know. So I started to work; and\nagain thanks to my knowledge in German, I got different uh jobs more or less...at least\npart Schreiber [Trans: \"scribe\"]. And now I work, say two hours; and two hours I\nworked in one small Kommando as Schreiber. In the afternoon, again I worked two\nhours, and went two hours this so-called clerical work. So that...what I made my life a\nlittle bit easier; because as a reward for my Schreiber work, I got a little bit of a soup\nextra from the kapo of that Kommando. Then...one of my...a friend of mine, he get...uh\ngot a position in the Kanada Kommando. He some...somehow was uh promoted there.\nAnd I go...go to...went to him, and told him, \"Listen.\u201d Uh, Carl was his name. \"Say, Carl,\ncan you do something for me? Look how I am. Look how I look. I would need a little bit\nto recover. Take me back to the Kommando.\u201d \"Oh, yes, I will arrange that you are\ncoming tomorrow to the Kommando.\u201d So I have been there a couple of weeks; and some\njealousy and intrigues started against that man who brought me back. So say\nthe...the...the Haftlings, the prisoners, uh claimed that I was working for him. That mean,\nI was stealing goods from the Kommando and carrying it for him. It wasn't true. The only\nthing what I ever \"organized\"--that was the slang expression for stealing--I organized\nonly food. For myself, and for a few friends for whom I could help with what I brought\nhome. I could share with them. So it went so far that they started to uh work against me.\n'Til one day, one of the fellows came to me and told me, \"When you are coming\ntomorrow morning to work, you are not going home.\u201d So naturally I didn't came. This\ntime a new Kommando started to...came in existence. Our job was to dismantle airplanes\nwhich has been shot up around that area, regardless German, English, American. And I\nbefriended myself with that kapo. I knew him from before. We worked always...already\nsometime together. He knew about my knowledge of the German language. So I started\nthere as a Schreiber. We started there with about a hundred uh prisoners, and slowly it\nwas built up to about thirteen hundred. So the responsibility was quite big, because we\nhad to have very exact evidence--every single number who was in the Kommando. In one\ncase, I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape. I don't know if they\nsucceeded or...or not. But the fact was they didn't came in to the camp. Big excitement.\n\"Schreiber from [zelligbatterie (ph)], nach voraus!\"--\"To the front to the gate. Give me\nthe numbers uh from these two men who are missing.\u201d I didn't have that on me. I turned\naround to go back; and I saw my assistant was already running behind me waving the\npiece of paper where the two numbers have been written down. Because that what\nhappens in the morning before we went out. Every group of twenty had to be...uh\ntheir...his...their numbers had to written down on a piece of paper. And they had to be\ncompared during the day, if he was yesterday in at work or not. So a lot of uh\nunnecessary scribbling. But he...so he came. He gave up that piece of paper to the SS in\nthe front. They look at that are the numbers. \"Hor auf!\" That mean, \"Disappear!\" So we\nwent back with no consequences whatsoever for us, because we been right. If I couldn't\nhave produced the two numbers, that would be the end of...of me. So I just want to\nmention that what uh kind of job and what...what the...what uh dangers in there...have\nbeen there everyday. Every moment was dangerous. Having a assistant this time, the new\ntransport arrived on the same uh track where we got the wagons where we unloaded the\nremnantses [sic] and the raw material from the planes. The aluminum and every usable\npart was uh sorted out. The old aluminum what went in the mills or 1n the factories, that\nwas recycled. So...and sometime on the same track came new transports. And in the\nKanada, they had the duty...when a transport came, they had been on the ramp; and when\nthey threw away their belongings, they had to collect it, pick it up and throw it on the\ntrucks which took them to the working place of the Kanada. But they been quite\nexperienced already to sneak out where is something to eat. So one of my friend--his\nname was [Juri (ph)] Fried. I don't know where he exists today, and looking for him in\nIsrael now when I've been there; but I couldn't get any uh news about him, where he\nexists. So he...I have to mention that on the end of this place where the newcomers has to\ndisembark from the train was a little hut. I went there when I saw from afar that the\ntransport is coming. So I went there, hide myself in the hut; and LJuri (ph)] Fried came\nwith...always with bags full of food. I was staying there and waiting 'til everything was\nover with, 'til the ramp was empty. So I took my harvest what I had and went back to the\nmain Kommando. And here in one day I had a quite a good harvest. I called up all the\nKapos. I had uh twenty-six of them; because thirteen hundred people...every hundred had\ntwo kapos. I called them up and told them, \"Listen. I want your sticks what you are using\nto beating the people.\u201d Very big surprise. \"What is this?\" \"You are getting from me food\nfor it. I don't mind if you have a small vine from some of the bushes here 1n your hand.\nBut the big heavy ones I want to have, because I need it as heating material for I will let\ncook for you something to eat. I have the raw material.\u201d So that was one of my biggest\ndeeds, in my opinion, what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners. 'Specially\nI didn't know everybody personally. But if only one was saved from two or three uh hits\nthrough a day, that was already something. So slowly, slowly they got used to it; and the\nbeating let up. Screaming, yes. Screaming doesn't hurt to anybody. So then one day in\nAugust 19 uh...44, we been on the march home uh from the.... We worked on Sundays\ntoo. Coming uh home, coming in front...one of my duties was to arrange the hundreds\nthat they should be at the long march. We had about nearly four kilometer march, and\nthirteen hundred people are walking tired. They are not walking like soldiers. So in front\nof the uh came about hundred fifty, two hundred meters--and that was exactly opposite\nthe Lager C where my wife used to be this time. And I stopped there, without looking\nback what is going on behind my back. Just at that moment, I saw a group of girls\nstanding there around. I didn't know how they came there, what they did there. And\nduring the time I was ordered...making that order, the SS man who was in charge in front\nof the camp in a wooden barrack, he called my wife in. \"Come here.\u201d She went there. She\nmade the procedure that uh how she had to report. And that...and he was drunk. He\nhardly saw (laughter)...and he hardly knew what he is doing. And asked her, \"Do you\nhave a boyfriend?\" She was surprised about that question, and said, \"No, I haven't got\none.\u201d And he asked, \"Why?\" \"Because nobody wants me,\" she said to him. And he said,\n\"I will take care that somebody should want you. The first man who is passing here by,\nthey had to want...have to want you.\u201d So the first one who came by was myself. So he\ntold me, \"Talk to her!\" So, naturally, on her number I recognized right away that she is a\ngirl from Slovakia. And uh, naturally, I ask, \"What is your name? What...where are you\nfrom?\" And about one or two such trivial questions. When she said, \"I can't talk like\nthis....\u201d\u2019 To the SS man. \"I can't talk to this...to a man whom I never saw before like this\non the street. And except [NB: besides], he has other duties to do.\u201d And he said, \"Yes,\nyes. You are...you are right.\u201d He called me. \"Come here!\" I told him, \"Yes, what you\nwant?\" He said, \"Tomorrow morning you are reporting here. And you have to come to\nthe camp.\u201d And to her, she [NB: he] said, \"You will be here in the morning, and you will\nstay here in the window. And when he cames, you will write his number in in the book.\u201d\nBecause everybody who came in or out was registered in a book, to keep it very exact\nand clear. So with that episode finished in that moment. So I, I did my job further; and I\njoined to the last five people who went in uh... went into the barrack. So straight away,\nwhen I came in, I went to my close friend, Erich Kulka--who is now here as a historian,\nhe just recently got his doctorate for something--with whom we are still in good\nfriendship. So I went to him. He was one of the maintenance men in the camp, and one of\nthe few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different camps, when if something was\nbroken down he was the man who had to repair it. He was working there as a engineer.\nThey call in English \"engineer,\" but a Schlosser [Trans: locksmith, mechanic or fitter]--\nhe was a fitter, or something like this. So he...I knew that he went quite often in the\nwomans camps, too; and I knew that he knows Magda. So I went straight to him and\nasked him, \"Listen, Erich. What is your opinion about Magda? Do you know her?\" \"Yes,\nI know her very well.\u201d \"And what is your opinion?\" He said, \"I will tell 1t to you in one\nsentence. (Pause-choking up) She is one...she is one of the few woman or persons here in\nthe camp who manage to be still human.\u201d I mean, I couldn't ask for a better information.\nSo I started to run around; I organized again a...a bottle of schnapps. Because that was\ndefinitely the best uh currency between SS and Haftlings what you can imagine. Better\nthan today the American dollar or the Fren...or the Japanese yen. So I got it through my\nconnections. The next day in the morning, really, I went in. When I came to the gate, I\ntook out from under my arm where I have hidden the bottle, put it on the window. And\nreally Magda was there. She write down my name. I mean, we didn't have names. Uh, my\nnumber; and uh so I could go in. She was very uh embarrassed. She...because she wasn't\nexpecting that I will come. But for curiosity, I wanted to find out what is going on,\nwanted from her certain in...information. So we went in. She was running away, hiding\nsomewhere. After few uh time...because in after short time, we met. We had uh the\nopportunity to talk a few words. So when I uh came in her room, because as in her\nfunctions she had the right to have a small room which was about two by four meter big.\nThat her own...she had her own bed. And when...when I saw her belongings, the few\nbelongings what she had. So she reminded me somehow of my wife. And later on she\nwas uh still very uh embarrassed, and a little bit out of shape; so she turns, she had a\nsmall mirror there hanging on the wall. She went there and started with her fingers to\narrange her hair. When I told her, \"Listen, it is quite a few years that I saw a woman\nstanding in front of a mirror and getting, combing on her hair.\u201d And that somehow\ntouched her, too. I was very touched, and she was very touched. And that somehow\nbrought us close. Closer. And in the next few weeks, now and then I asked permission\nfrom my Oberkapo that he let me one or a few times to go and visit her. Just harmless\ntalk, because everything else was dangerous. And it was because the fact was, I didn't\nwant to be somehow too much uh interested; because when you are not uh.... I don't\nknow how you said that. Fallstrick [Trans: pitfall, trap]. When you are not careful\nenough, it can can bring you in trouble; and that is what we... nobody needed. So the\nwhole relationship, all the time what we went in, was absolute platonic. So the time went\nby. I saw her about five or six times. And I started to like her; because I saw what she's\ndoing, how's she's doing, how.... And I knew her reputation in the camp. Because\neverybody knew all about her, everybody in the men's camp knew about her and knew\nabout her deeds--what she is doing and how she is doing. She had a wonderful reputation\nin the...1n the camp. And naturally I was very much impressed with that. And later on,\nend of November or so, '44, some difficulties started on in my Kommando. I had that...I\nwas already one and a half years there. So she arranged somehow that I could join to a\nsmall Kommando which came regularly every day to her camp to do some maintenance\nwork. There was a small magazine. There been a small, uh a few old sewing machines. It\nwas our duty to clean them and bring them to shape. But we always was talking and\nnever did real, some real work. So then came the 18th of January [1945]. The 18th of\nJanuary was the day when the death march from Auschwitz started. So we, we...uh we\nmarched late afternoon from Birkenau. We was taken over to Auschwitz. I tried to hide\nthere, to stay there what maybe I hoped. But then the rumors went around [that] the\nwhole camp is undermined, that there exist a plan that camps uh will be bombarded from\nall sides with artillery and with the planes, to make it to disappear. And...but still I went\nup in one of the blocks. I was very tired; because the whole day, we...the stress. We had\nto \"antrehen, abtreten, antreten, abtreten\" [report, get dismissed, report, get dismissed |\nabout five or six times during the day. So I went in one of the blocks which was already\nempty. I hide...I hid myself under...in one of the beds, and I fell asleep. Around midnight,\nall of a sudden I am woken up from the absolute quietness what was in the la...what was\nit in the camp. And I was very curious what is happening. So I went down, opened the\ngate; and in that moment two of my friends with whom I used to work together in Kanada\npassed by. They saw me. They say, \"What you are doing here?\" \"I want to stay here. I\ndon't want to...I have enough. I tried....\u201d \"No, don't stay here. That will be blown up\neverything. It is dangerous. Come. Come. We are going. Come with us.\u201d So I went. So I\ndid it, that death march. We walked through uh three uh nights, days and nights. And in\none intersection we collided with the woman. We came from ...from a different...they\ncame from a different way than we. And the woman, they looked for men. The men\nlooked for woman, if somebody's there. Relation, friend or something. The woman... the\ngirls went to the SS woman asking for permission, if they could give them a permission\nto talk to us; because somebody recognized me there from one of her friends and told that\n\"Bela is there. Try what you can do.\u201d But meantime a big crowd started; because such a\nmass of people, two or four SS woman or men couldn't keep uh back even if they would\nstart to shoot or whatever. So they started a big crowd; and we somehow came close to\neach other and we spoke a few words, and then...to each other. And I told her, \"Listen.\nWe are now in a Situation we know the war can't keep very long any more. So if we are\ncoming home, I want to meet you.\u201d And she told me, \"Ah! Who knows how we will\nmeet?\" I...we...somehow we been so uh used to that not to have names but we had only\nnumbers. But I wasn't thinking on it that when we are coming home and we will be\nregistered somewhere that I won't register under names, but under numbers. And I told\nher, \"Listen. I tell you...look when you...when you are coming home and you are coming\nhome, look for my number.\u201d \"Oh, I never will remember your number.\u201d \"You will. I will\nexplain to you how.\u201d And I showed her: \"Listen. I have 65066, is my number. Your\nnumber, 2318. These your four numbers are included in my five.\u201d She asked how. I said,\n\"Look, 5 - 6- 11 - 12 is 23. Three 6 is 18. Simple as that.\u201d You know? Good that we\nhaven't been registered, thank heavens, on the numbers but on the names. She came some\nwhere in East...to East Germany. I came to Mauthausen. I was in one month in\nMauthausen, 1n the so-called quarantine. Naturally, when we arrived we been\nuh...stripped what we had. I had relative good clothes. And in my pocket--to our bad\nluck, Magda got from a woman from Bratislava a check to the uh...to one of the English\nbanks. I don't know where that woman had transferred before the war big money from\nBratislava to that...I think it was the Barclay Bank. I am not sure any more. And that\nwoman came to Magda one day and told her, \"Listen. I see what you are doing here. I am\na very rich woman. We have a lot of money in...in uh England, and all over the world. I\nhave a little chance to survive. I am older than you. Maybe you will survive. As a\ngratitude for that what you are doing here, I give you that check of thousand dollars,\nthousand pounds.\u201d And when we met on that place what I mentioned before, she [NB:\nMagda] told me, \"You are a man. Take that check to you. Maybe it is safer with you.\u201d\nUnfortunately, it worked out if it would stay with her she could keep it. I couldn't;\nbecause when we came to Mauthausen, they stripped us. They stole all our uh better\nclothing what we had. And I didn't had...I wasn't thinking on it; and even if I would think\nit on it to take it out from my pocket, I had not the where to hide it. It was written on a\nthin paper. If I put it in my mouth, it would be dissolved; and go through the shower and\nsave it, such a piece of paper.... So.... But I honestly admit, I wasn't even thinking on it.",
        "A: In Mauthausen, we been about one month.",
        "A: From Mauthausen, we was taken over to Gusen,. which been an ammunition factories,\npartly. And Gusen I and Gusen II was uh factory...one of the factories was the\nMesserschmitt uh Werke, for the Messerschmitt planes--war planes. So I was uh\nassigned. Because when they asked my profession, I told them I am an engineer. I\nthought it doesn't do any harm not to be a laborer, or a accountant or a doctor or a\nsolicitor, whatever. So, OK. So they registered me as an engineer; and when it came to\nthat uh Gusen II needed people, they sended us there. And I was assigned to work in the\npart to uh fix the petrol tanks, the gas tanks, in the uh wings of the Messerschmitt. I don't\nwhich number was it-- 87, or the 111. I don't...can't remember anymore. But we didn't do\na lot of work, because we didn't got any raw material.",
        "A: On the first of May; and to tell that when we got up in the morning, and instead to take us\nback in the Messerschmitt uh factory, they took us to a place in the name Gunskirchen.\nThat's supposed to be one of the new camps in that area which Hitler in his fantasy and in\nhis dreams thought he will keep the last resistance 'til his [wonderritens (ph)] will be\ncompleted. And he can uh resist there in that area ad infinitum. But this camp was in the\nbeginning stadion [NB: stages]. That it what was a camp the Germans put in middle in\nthe forest a big uh saw machine, driven with a...uh petrol engine. They cut off the trees,\nput it on the machine, made boards out of it and [brewed (ph)] the bark. When we came\nthere it was the First of May. Accident...accidentally, I remember the day exactly;\nbecause on the way, when we went on the...uh road, a old uh Wehrmachts man who was\ncalled up--he was this time about fifty--started to talk with me, and he still believed that\nHitler will win the war. It was the First of May '45. So...so when we came in...in the\ncamp, the barracks wasn't ready. No windows, no doors and no roof. The roof was only\nthe main pillars; but empty in between, so that water, snow, everything could go through.\nLuckily the rain stopped just a few days before we.... And the nice, very nice spring\nweather started.",
        "A: American.\nSubcamp of Mauthausen.\n* Another subcamp of Mauthausen located in Austria. From his subsequent description, it is clear\nthat he was sent to the Waldwerke I section of the camp.",
        "A: American.",
        "A: I didn't saw them at all. I just heared...heard them. I mean, in the beginning uh.... It was\nthe 7th of May in the afternoon. I was wandering around in the camp; because in the\nsame camp atrived a lot of Hungarian uh men who came from the Don and from the\nDnieper. From these area, from deep in uh...in Russia. And from the Ukraine, there came\na forced march. And being Hungarian, and I had relatives in a certain township in\nHungaria [Hungary]. So I went around in the hope that I will find somebody whom I\nknow. So I went in one of the barracks; and a fellow came out. And I ask him, \"I hear uh\npeople from Szombathely....\u201d That is the place where I had an uncle. And I knew...know\nhe had four sons and three daughters, or whatsoever. And somebody told me, \"Yes, there\nare here. Whom you think?\" I said, \"I would like now if one of the Blau boys are here.\u201d I\ncouldn't tell the name, which of them could be, because there are four boys. He told me,\n\"Yes, they are here. One is here.\u201d \"Where is he?\" Indeed I ask. I...he looked back. \"Yes,\nhe's coming here. That is him.\u201d So we came, we started to talk a few words with each\nother. Because I never saw him in my life before. One of his brothers I knew, his father I\nknew, one of his sisters I knew.... Because this time from Bratislava to Hungary to travel\nwasn't so easy. And uh only by very special occasions could somebody come over.\n"
