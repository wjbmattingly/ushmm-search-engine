        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr.\nBrooks McClure, on July 7\", 2011, here at the co \u2014 Center for Advanced Holocaust\nStudies, at the m \u2014 hol -- United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. And Mr.\nMcClure, thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today. I\u2019m going to start\nthe interview as fairy tales do, at the very beginning. And that\u2019s going to be to ask you\nyour \u2014 when you were born, the date you were born, what was your family like, and\nwe'll take it from there.",
        "Answer: Well, I was born in\u2014 on March 8\", 1919 in New York City, and lived there\nfor the next 20 years of my life. I never went back, really. So I\u2014 my recollections of\ncourse, are of a nearly ra \u2014 a disruptive period. We were going through the Great\nDepression, and I thought for a while I was more or less exempt from the effects of this\nthing. But my father was an engineer and he got very sick early in his life, and died at\n53.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: This was 1940.",
        "Q: So you were 21 years old?",
        "A: I was 21, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And had you liv \u2014 when you said New York City, were you \u2014 did you grow up in\nManhattan, or in the outer boroughs?\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: I grew up in Manhattan.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Had you done \u2014 attended college? Had you finished high school?",
        "A: No, that was the thing you see. We were relatively well-off, and also terribly\nconservative economically. So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for\nanything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry. But,\nthere was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that\nsuddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were\ngoing to have to take over in some fashion, and this 1s \u2014 this would be very dis-\ndisorganizing, as it was. And so \u2014",
        "Q: Did he \u2014 excuse me \u2014 did he have his own business, your father?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No. He worked for somebody else.",
        "A: He worked for the New York state transportation department, and his own job had\nto do with train wrecks. When \u2014 when there was an accident, they had a team that went\nout and tried to find out why it happened. And he was very good at that business, I\nguess, because he went right through from \u2014 he was a very young man, almost an office\nboy when he arrived, and worked his way up. And the thing is, he had no education\neither. He \u2014 he was born in Ohio, and he went to the good schools. I guess you would\nsay he was a very ambitious man, and he read all the time, and that was a great\nJuly 7, 2011\ninfluence for me. He had me reading Dickens and Dumas when I was nine and 10\nyears old, but \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty impressive.",
        "A: Well, if you starting at the right end \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, for instance \u2014 well, I guess it was Robert Louis Stevenson, it was \u2014\nwas the start of my foreign education, and \u2014 what was it, the \u2014 \u201cTreasure Island\u201d was\nthe first book. So, he very carefully chose the books to be at a level where I could\nunderstand, hopefully, and \u2014",
        "Q: Were you his only child?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Were you his only child, or did you have br \u2014",
        "A: No, no, there was a girl after me.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re the oldest.",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 I was the eldest, yeah. And well, at any rate, I \u2014 I got a piece of\neducation from reading, and I \u2014 the reading habit I got into, and had occasional troubles\nwith my schoolteachers because they didn\u2019t think that the family should race ahead of\nthis program, you know.",
        "Q: Curriculum, yeah.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old man, and \u2014 but he \u2014 he got very, very sick.\nHeart can \u2014 heart condition, and we knew he wasn\u2019t going to be around a long time, so\nwe had to prepare for this. And the preparation did not include any possibility of going\nto college.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with\na high school education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn\u2019t have much of\na chance. So \u2014 but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which\nactually I developed in the grammar school. And before I got out of grammar school, I\nhad an idea, I \u2014 I had a\u2014I wa \u2014 a little play friend, the \u2014 these correspondences with\nchildren from other places.",
        "Q: Oh, pen-pal.",
        "A: Yeah, one of \u2014 one of my teachers went to, of all places, western Australia, which\nis just \u2014 just about west of anything in the wor \u2014 in the world. And so I-I got the \u2014 my\nfriend sent me the local paper \u2014 matter of fact, all of the local papers. And I noticed that\none was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others.\nThere was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page\none and that sort of thing. This was different, this had headlines on page one\n[indecipherable] news on page one. And I was really intrigued by this. And I had\nalready started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism. I\nJuly 7, 2011\ndon\u2019t know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that. And \u2014 and then\none day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old Australia, would like\nto have a correspondent in the United States.",
        "Q: Not a bad notion.",
        "A: And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in \u2014 in Asia who traveled\naround. And then they had another correspondent in London, which was home to the\nAustralians. And so these were very special needs. One was, of course, the local aspect,\nof the \u2014 of news, and the other was London. And \u2014 but I said th \u2014 I-I decided to write a\nletter to the editor. So I went to the British \u2014 the \u2014 I don\u2019t read it any more, but oh, I\ncan\u2019t remember the name of it. At any rate, it\u2019s \u2014 was \u2014 it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a British\npublication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for \u2014 that we\nhave.",
        "Q: The Economist? Would it be the Economist?",
        "A: No, no, the \u2014",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: \u2014no, no, no, this 1\u2014 no, no. No, it says \u2014\nA2: You mean like the encyclopedia.",
        "A: Sure, it\u2019s got the name of a \u2014 of a the \u2014 research publication, but \u2014",
        "Q: I see, okay.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: But at any rate, it was the one place where they had all of the editors by name,\neverywhere in the British commonwealth. And so I thought, well, in the British\ncommonwealth, they speak English, and that\u2019s the only thing I can speak, so I wrote\nthem a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism. No mention of grade, age,\nanything like that. So, I had the \u2014 and I followed my father\u2019s rules. He said, when you\nwrite a letter, you keep it on one page, if you possibly can, because you lose the reader\non the second page.",
        "Q: Absolutely right. Absolutely right.",
        "A: And so \u2014 so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don\u2019t be\nfooled by the multi-syllable words. So I just said in plain English that I was a\u2014a\njournalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their\npaper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other places, and none in the\nUnited States. So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a\ncorrespondent. And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know. I\nconsulted no one, and I got \u2014 I had the shivers afterwards. Then, in the normal turn of\nevents, which between the United States and \u2014 and Australia is about two months, I\ngot a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are \u2014 we are\ninterested in you. We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let\u2019s\nconsider it a possibility. And so I did, I\u2014 I found the name of the editor of the\npublication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very\nJuly 7, 2011\nlong article about the failure of the \u2014 0-0-of Roosevelt\u2019s policies. Because at that time,\nit were \u2014 that was about 1937 was it, something like that.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t even 20 years old? You were like 18.",
        "A: Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old. I\u2014 I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had \u2014\nhad absolutely nothing, so \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: But chutzpah. A lot of chutzpah.",
        "A: Oh, a lot \u2014 a lot of \u2014 a lot of gall.",
        "Q: So, Id like to turn this now to \u2014 as you\u2019re speaking, a number of thoughts are going\nthrough my mind. When I\u2019ve interviewed other people who were part of liberating\nforces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did,\nto news, to world events, to \u2014 1t \u2014 to people who were different from yourselves. So one\nof the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to Europe, did\nyou meet anybody who was Jewish. Well, if you live in Manhattan, chances are you\ndid.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t miss them.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh yes, well, that\u2019s a Jewish city, almost.",
        "Q: And then my second question 1s, is that if you were interested in news and\njournalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of\nwhat Germany was doing?\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Oh, oh certainly. I was right \u2014 I \u2014 I was reading about Hitler, 1t seemed, when he\nfirst came up.",
        "Q: To power.",
        "A: [indecipherable] by \u2014 what was his name? A famous, very arrogant guy, who\nseemed to win wars without thinking about it.\nA2: Hindenburg.",
        "Q: Hindenburg\u2019?\nA2: Talking about Hindenburg, von Hindenburg.",
        "Q: Von Hindenburg?\nA2: Paul von Hindenburg. Paul von Hindenburg.",
        "Q: Paul von Hindenburg?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And \u2014\nA2: The chancellor.",
        "Q: The chancellor, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And so I a\u2014I was a con \u2014 conscious of the growth of Hitler. Actually, almost\neverybody was, but I read so much. I read internationally because I was interested in\nJuly 7, 2011\ninternational affairs, but I was also \u2014 I-I was taught at home that you \u2014 you\u2019re a man\nwhen you gu \u2014 when you\u2019re born, and you use your brain from there on. And so it was\na very good policy. And I had a mixed literary education, in that I \u2014 there was \u201cTarzan\nof the Apes,\u201d which I also read, and the bi \u2014 the \u2014 was it the Hunter boys?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A-Another series. And so here I was reading the classical 20\" century \u2014 or 19\"\ncentury literature from Europe, in English, of course, translated, and then these other\nbooks, and enjoying them both. But at any rate, no, I was really up on the news in\nEurope. There were a lot of other things too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble\nthere. France was having a terrible time. This was followed up by the other activities\nthat are \u2014 were very ominous in Japan. They were going after Manchukuo \u2014 ma \u2014\nManchuria. And \u2014 and in Africa the Italians were trying to take over \u2014",
        "Q: Ethiopia.",
        "A: Ethiopia. So, it was a very disturbing time, interesting time. I can\u2019t say that I was\nscared by it. I was intrigued by it, and there was some very good books at the time\ncoming out, various commentators; professional journalists wrote books.",
        "Q: Well, William Shirer, I think, was based in Berlin at the time.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well I \u2014 he was a giant in the \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 in the group. But at any rate, there was a great deal of concentration on the things\nthat counted abroad, and also many of the problems at home. We had no military\npolicy, and we were \u2014 we were terribly weak at the time, and that was one of the big\nissues coming up in the United States, how do we protect it?",
        "Q: So I\u2019d like to turn it back to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and\nhis role in your education. And \u2014 did these \u2014 these events, these world events that you\nare talking about, not only in Europe but elsewhere, but of course for us it\u2019s\nparticularly what was going on in Europe; were you discussing these at home?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, we \u2014 we, of course, had dinner every night in the dining room, and it\nwas a conversat-sational sort of sport. So we talked about everything, and sometimes\nwhen I wasn\u2019t old enough to know, I got instructed from the higher people, my mother\nand father. And yeah, you know, it was a \u2014 it was a very good way to get educated, I\nthink, without feeling the pain.",
        "Q: Yeah, it is. It is. To have got \u2014 to have \u2014 to have conversations around the dinner\ntable about important events of the day is something that doesn\u2019t happen that often any\nmore.",
        "A: There were a lot of people then, commentators on radio. There was one fellow \u2014\nwhat was his name?\nA2: Kaltenborn.",
        "A: Yeah, Kaltenborn.\nJuly 7, 2011\nA2: H\u2014H.V. Kaltenborn.",
        "A: Yeah. He was a \u2014 and there was also a man who spoke so fast, we couldn\u2019t eat. So\nwe turned him off. And Lowell Thomas, and you know, a lot of people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The pretty \u2014 pretty much accomplished journalists. And the \u2014 and who could\nexpound on a-anything. I think they had a little more freedom than they do today,\nbecause there are other people who popped up and said, you\u2019re wrong. And so that was\na very good example of growing up in a democratic state.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It was a\u2014 it was a fine experience, and a lot of fun.",
        "Q: So, did you write \u2014 after that first article that you sent to the Australian newspaper,\ndid you become their correspondent? Did you end up submitting pieces?",
        "A: Well, I did, actually I did, but that \u2014 long before that, they had that article, which\nwas very long. It took a whole bedsheet of paper, that they used to print on those days,\nand oh, they had the [indecipherable] that they \u2014 usually you find in the \u2014 in the\nEnglish press, but in the American. Our correspondent in New York \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 tell us what in the world is going on there? So \u2014 so I was astonished, because they\nwere sort of ta \u2014 presuming. They didn\u2019t know how old I was. I know they wanted to\nfind the \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t ask the basic questions.",
        "A: They weren\u2019t \u2014 well, they wanted to find out, but events were moving too fast.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I was, of course, absolutely stunned, because I had a plan. As soon as I got that\nrejection, I would write to an English paper in South Africa, and see if I could work on\nthem. And there was no \u2014 there was no compensation for this, but every few weeks I\u2019d\nget a very generous check, a hundred dollars, which to me \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot of money.",
        "A: \u2014 was a lot of money, to cover my expenses. Well, my expenses were because I\ntraveled by subway, and you know, were \u2014 were very slim. And \u2014 but I\u2014I hada\nterrible time because I found that between reading about these things and getting an\nidea of how coverage is done, and then having your pencil in your hand and trying to\ndecide, do I do it, or d-d \u2014 or don\u2019t I? I had a couple of disastrous \u2014 potentially\ndisastrous experiences. One was Lena Medina. Lena Medina was a five year old girl\nin Lima, Peru who gave birth to a child \u2014 at least the story, this is what the story said.\nAnd my source was I had read it, it was a UP dispatch. And I knew because I\u2019d gotten\nthe \u2014 a sort of the copy boy\u2019s job at the \u201cHerald Tribune\u2019 at the \u2014 at that time. I knew\nthat the paper always substituted the UP for AP or anybody else in Latin America,\nbecause they felt that it was more reliable. So in comes this strange story, and I was too\nyoung to have the educational experience of anything involving women. Women were\nJuly 7, 2011\nthere, and what it takes \u2014 what I assume it \u2014 you know, it assumes that. But at any rate",
        "Q: That it\u2019s unusual if they give birth at five.",
        "A: \u2014 this was all to \u2014 very unusual, I thought it was \u2014 I thought instinctively it was\nimpossible, because I had never met anyone five years old who had a child.\nA2: Reasonable conclusion.",
        "A: And so I sent in my cable as one of the little stories I had from America, this strange\nplace where five year olds have children. And then apparently \u2014",
        "Q: They printed it, I bet.",
        "A: They \u2014 they printed it, oh what they did though, they did a very clever thing.",
        "Q: What did they do?",
        "A: They also doubted the veracity of this.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So they called every [indecipherable] person in Perth, and asked them what they\nthought of it, and they said, it\u2019s crazy. It can\u2019t be, it\u2019s impossible. So then they \u2014 they\nran that story together with my story, in order to take the onus off themselves, in case I\n\u2014I\u2019d gone crazy. And \u2014 but they had, and they didn\u2019t know it. And so then there was\nthat dead \u2014 dreadfully dead period, nobody wrote me or anything saying you shouldn\u2019t\ntake these stories seriously. And I had my explanation all done, because I realized, I\ntalked to some older people, th-they said, oh, that\u2019s ridiculous. So then \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: Trial and error.",
        "A: \u2014 \u201cLife\u201d magazine was bought by somebody on the paper. And this was a \u2014 oh,\nmonth or two later, and all \u2014 everything goes very slowly out there. So \u2014 and it showed\na picture of Lina Medina, her surgeon who had per \u2014 performed the operation. It was a\n\u2014 it was a\u2014 a Caesarian operation. And \u2014 and there was the little infant, believe it or\nnot, there he was. And \u2014 and they got very excited about this, so immediately they\njumped on it. They \u2014 they reported the existence of the photograph, and said they\u2019d \u2014 or\nthey \u2014 they thought that they should print the fact that this was photographed, maybe\neverybody would be interested in reading it, or seeing it. And they \u2014 they got really\nvery excited. The publisher began going back to the Monday lunches that he had sort of\nartfully dodged, after that terrible thing. And the \u2014",
        "Q: Does this mean your journalistic career was born with that article?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, I had the writing, yo-you know, I\u2019d been submitting stuff, and\nthey\u2019d been printing it, and I got pretty sassy about it. I expected to see the story\nrepeated, whatever I said, with a byline on it. They put a byline every story, even a\nshort one. And no complaint, no instructions, nothing from them. They just let me go. I\nhad \u2014 and then in 1941, I still had this job, and I had the \u2014 another one of those shocks.\nI was \u2014 I \u2014I had a very weak \u2014 weak week. Poor week for journalism. Nothing was\ndeveloping that I thought I could afford to send. It was 35 cents a na \u2014 a \u2014 a word, press\nif I filed. So I was very conscious of this, par-particularly because of my Scottish ba \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011\nbackground, and I didn\u2019t want to waste the paper\u2019s money. So I came to this crisis\nwhere that weekly cable looked pretty feeble. Excuse me. And there was a big, big\nevent the Wednesday before. This was about Friday, I was filing. And there was a\nbattle at Aron between the French and the British. Maybe you remember it. I don\u2019t\nknow how they [indecipherable] but this was a pretty exciting story because the\nBritish and French were allies, and they \u2014 the French had been trying to get Admiral\nDarlan, who was in command of the French forces, to \u2014 to surrender, and the \u2014 the\nFrench were very stubborn; they wouldn\u2019t surrender. So finally the British said, all\nright, if you don\u2019t surrender, we\u2019re going to fight you. And they started this battle, a\nreally horrible thing because the casualty rate was enormous. Some of the biggest ships\nthen operating in the two navies, had been sunk, there in Algeria, of all places.",
        "Q: Is that where the battle was taking place?",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: In Algeria, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, that was it. And so I knew all about this, of course, and then source reports in\nthe general news that so many ships had been lost, and so many people had been killed.\nIt was a pretty horrible outcome. But I thought [indecipherable] and maybe \u2014 maybe I\ncould sneak it in, and they\u2019d realize that I was using old news, but I had to. And so,\noddly enough, they printed it. But what they did is they ran \u2014 they went to the archives\nand got the Jane\u2019s book \u2014 Jane\u2019s ships, and copied out the pictures that were\nJuly 7, 2011\nmentioned, all of the casualties, and read it down one side of page one. And then they\nsent all of \u2014 the few little words I had to say, I never mentioned anything that I \u2014 you\nknow [indecipherable] to repeat. But obviously the battle had been fought, and I had to\nsay something about it. So I did that, and that was all printed in eight point type. So\nmust have been a very impressive thing. I never saw it.",
        "Q: You never saw that piece as it ran?",
        "A: No, the paper never came. My \u2014 every once in a while I\u2019d miss a copy. So, any rate I\n\u2014I was agonized when I discovered that they printed it, and no other paper in Australia\nprinted it, of course. And so th-there was no wi \u2014 no battle and all of its casualties from\nBrooks McClure. So I wondered how \u2014 how we got around this, and what happened.\nWell, what happened was that I \u2014 I always made s-small reports, as small as I could\nmake them, and put each story on a different page. And then I\u2019d sit in the telegrapher\u2019s\noffice and peel them off wa \u2014 one by one. Well, because this was such a bad reporting\nday, I worked very hard and very late, to get the best I could out of it, and so I guess the\ncable came in with this odd story in the middle, and the rest of it much less important\nstuff. And so the Australian censor then record it. What they done is they blanked it\nout. And so, on the next Wednesday was an announcement that Churchill is going to\nmake a special speech. And so everybody in the world was listening to that, and they\nheard all about the Battle of Aron, many of them for the first time. So, at any rate, I\nescaped \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that time, and I didn\u2019t even know it. And I thought I was so smart, oh boy.\n[indecipherable] to get it. They said they didn\u2019t know what to do, they held a \u2014 and\neditorial conference, and \u2014 and they were all standing around, they \u2014 all the editors, and\ndebating this thing. Finally somebody said well, look, he\u2019s our man, and we\u2019re \u2014 we \u2014\nwe trust him, and it\u2019s all down on paper. I think we should stick with it, see what\nhappens. And so everybody more or less agreed, that\u2019s what they did. And they saved\nthemselves a lot of trouble. Well, all right, I\u2019m sorry. I hope I didn\u2019t digress \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: \u2014 too much.",
        "Q: It \u2014 it \u2014 this is \u2014 it is all very relevant, because it brings me to the next point. And\nthat is, you had mentioned earlier that your dad passed away in 1940, and that your life\nchanged at that time.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And I wanted to \u2014 I wanted to ask in which way it had changed, and how did you \u2014\ndid you have to leave journalism then? Did you have t \u2014 did you make decisions to go\ninto the military, were you drafted? I want to bring \u2014 get us to the place where you\u2019re\nending up in Europe, and t \u2014 and tell me what the sequence of events was.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Oh well, I was \u2014 I was not drafted yet, and I guess I had a slightly preferential rating,\nbecause I had al \u2014 besides my father, who was very sick, I had three women to take care\nof in the immediate family.",
        "Q: And they were?",
        "A: So I had \u2014 may have had a [indecipherable], but the \u2014 but I \u2014 they didn\u2019t draft me,\nand I didn\u2019t volunteer until much later. But wa \u2014 events moved very fast. He was a\nstubborn old Scot and he \u2014 he went to work every day. He didn\u2019t know he was dying\nand his physician was recommending that he quit, and all that. No, he wanted to go on,\ndo the job. So it was a terrible strain on everybody who loved him, of course. And I \u2014\nwhat changed \u2014 well, one thing that didn\u2019t change was the journalism idea. I had now\nfixed it, because I did this silly thing. And I knew that that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\nRegardless, I \u2014 I went hunting all over New York, all over Westchester County to try\nto get a job. And of course, they almost laughed. What school did I go to? And I only\n[indecipherable] curious creature. I was six-one, 180 pounds, and in other words,\nalways out of line with my peers, and \u2014 and always doing silly things. So \u2014 so I\u2014I got\nthe desserts I \u2014 I really worked for, and couldn\u2019t get a job in \u2014 on a newspaper. So, we\nhad \u2014 we had to manage \u2014 course, we had to live on the re \u2014 the savings of the family,\nand it was very hard. I \u2014 I was out run \u2014 running around, trying to get another job and\nall this, and it was \u2014",
        "Q: Did you stay \u2014 where did you live in Manhattan? Was it in \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",

        "A: Well, Manhattan is ver \u2014 is long and lean. And when you get up to the top, there\u2019s\na little \u2014 little piece at the very top, it\u2019s a mountain, and it\u2019s called Laurel Hill.",

        "Q: I know the area now. I get a better sense of that. I wanted to then \u2014 you were looking\nfor \u2014 you were looking for a job. Did you eventually find one?",
        "A: Well, I got a job, oddly, on the \u2014 on the \u201cHerald Tribune.\u201d I had been writing a\nlittle bit, trying to sell some articles in America, too. And I didn\u2019t do spectacularly, but\nI made a few sales. And then there was a man named Charlie McLenden(ph), who had\njust taken over as city editor of the \u201cHerald Tribune,\u201d and I got an interview with him.\nJuly 7, 2011\nAnd I brought my clippings, to show him that I was doing something. And he said well,\nI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have any jobs for \u2014 for people like you, you know, education, all\nthose considerations, on \u2014 on the staff. But he said, I \u2014 Pll hire you for \u2014 on the \u2014 for \u2014\nas a copyboy. That was another irrelevancy, here I was over six feet tall, and running\ncopy from one desk to another. Sort of an embarrassing situation. And so I had that job\nfor a long time, they didn\u2019t fire me, they kept me on. And they had a reputation for\nthose that they \u2014 that passed the test and stayed, of \u2014 of making them reporters after a\ncertain length of time. But all these people had, you know, education. So it didn\u2019t look\nvery promising. But I was able to use the paper\u2019s facilities, their library, the \u2014 they had\nan internal telegraph office, where I spent a lot of time writing up my stuff. And the\nwork wasn\u2019t hard. The \u2014 this big goof was running around doing it. And so, at any rate,\nI used it to good advantage, and almost gave up. I \u2014 I was \u2014 I was then 23.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, so that\u2019s 1942.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Well, that\u2019s when I joined the army, and I \u2014 my mother and I had\na ken \u2014 consultation. I asked her what she would think if I went in the army. She said\nshe thought it was a very intelligent thing to do. After all, there are all kinds of people,\nbig sons like you that have to go. Sure they have to die, they have to suffer, but they\u2019re\ngoing. And she said that, you\u2019re an American, you have to decide what to do. So I\njoined the infantry, which was the most idiotic thing to do. I\u2019m sure I could have gotten\na job at a \u2014 at a better branch of the service, but \u2014 but I fel \u2014 felt very patriotic at the\nJuly 7, 2011\ntime, I did the right thing. So \u2014 and then, of course, I had to make a lot of changes, I\nhad to quit my job in aus \u2014 Australia. Which actually was paying off a little bit, you\nknow, they were paying me far more than I was worth, and I had originally asked just\nto \u2014 to work for nothing, but they wouldn\u2019t accept that. So, they were very nice. And so\nthen off I went into the infantry.",

        "Q: Were you based in the \u2014 in the U.S. for a while?",
        "A: United States? Oh yeah, sure. I\u2019d, of course, did all the basic training and all, which\nis a\u2014 which is another great exercise. It\u2019s very, very hard, you know, you \u2014 you have to\nfall on your rifle, and do all sorts of odd things that normal human beings probably\nwouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: But \u2014 but I got along all right, I got promotions. And then I had a \u2014 a specialty, I \u2014 I\ndeveloped a special skill [indecipherable] because I worked at night, and sometimes I\nstayed over, and then the fellow down \u2014 we had a wire link between New York and\nWashington, and there was another young fellow there, just in my same position. And\nwe would send long messages to each other. And I \u2014I got so that I could type 60 words\na minute.",
        "Q: Wow.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: And then \u2014 that\u2019s the speed of the transmitter distributor that does it automatically,\nyou know. And so, when I got in the army, I did another foolish thing. They said, put\ndown anything you think y-you might be able to do in the service, if you have a special",
        "Q: Skill, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 skill. So I thought about that a little bit. I thought the only thing I knew how to do\nwas to type. So \u2014 so I told him that I could \u2014 I \u2014 I could imitate the speed of a \u2014 an\nelectric transmitter on the typewriter. Well that\u2019s \u2014 really that wasn\u2019t such a \u2014 an\nachievement. There are millions of girls with typewriters who could do that.",
        "Q: But they\u2019re not in the army.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s right. And they didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do this. So somebody had run\nthe IBM rod you know, through the bo \u2014 through the cards, and came out with this\nremarkable fact that one of their soldiers \u2014 actually, I had \u2014 I had this experience with\ncomputer \u2014 with transmitters that, you know \u2014 computer transmission.\nA2: The teletypes.",
        "Q: The teletypes probably.\nA2: The teletypes.",
        "A: Yeah.\nA2: The teletypes?",
        "Q: Was it the teletypes?\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, teletypes, yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, mm-hm.",
        "A: So, well, then I didn\u2019t know this, but the \u2014 the army decided in the earlier period,\nwhen they weren\u2019t so overwhelmed, that they would experiment with a \u2014 a wireless.\nWell, wireless was an unknown then, for teletypes, although it\u2019s \u2014 today it\u2019s e-\neverywhere. And so they \u2014 they transferred me. I think I was a \u2014I was probably just a\nPFC at the time. And \u2014",
        "Q: Private first class?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Private first class?",
        "A: Private first class. And all of a sudden I found that I was still in the infantry, but I\nhad this special assignment. They had teletype machines, and you could practice on\nthem, and I practiced on them, and somebody else did too. And one of \u2014 two of \u2014 two\nother men were taken in for this, but they were both noncoms. One was a master\nsergeant and the other ta \u2014 the next le-level. And so \u2014 but they came out of the \u2014 out of\nthe signals business, they worked for railroads, you know, all sorts of things. So they\nhad plenty of experience. They knew all about how \u2014 how these things worked. I didn\u2019t\nknow, I couldn\u2019t repair one. I wa \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to tell them I wasn\u2019t qualified. I was\nsecretly pleased that the \u2014 well, I guess I already had a grade. I was probably a corporal\nor a sergeant by that time. And I\u2019Il tell you, when you think and what you do in the\nJuly 7, 2011\ninfantry, how you will get home to mama is a question. So \u2014 so I the \u2014 I\u2014I decided I'd\ndo what the wa \u2014 army wanted me to do. And so I had this curious job all through \u2014\nactually variations in my career, I joined the air force, and I \u2014 I \u2014 I qualified, and I was\nvery keen about that.",
        "Q: Was this post-war?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Joining the air force was post-war, or during the war?",
        "A: No, this was during the height of the casualties in \u2014 in the eighth army, you know, in\nthe \u2014 in \u20141n Europe. And of course, we weren\u2019t doing too well the \u2014 Asia either, but \u2014\nbut it was a \u2014 it was a death wish, actually, if you got into that. And I \u2014 I was willing to\ngo, but when I had any kind of alternative, I \u2014 I was willing to accept it. Then a \u2014",
        "Q: Because the in \u2014 can I just \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 clarify? Because being in the infantry would have been the worst possible\nsituation. Is that \u2014 1-1f I understand this properly? It was \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 not the \u2014 the least of \u2014 le-let me see if I can rephrase that. Is it if you want to get\nhome to mama, being in the infantry is going to be the place where it\u2019s least likely to\nhappen?",
        "A: Oh, wi \u2014 yes, I would say so.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: Although the \u2014 although I discovered after I got in the air force, that the casualty rate\nwas just as great. They shoot you out of the sky, and \u2014 instead. So the question \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014\nI wasn\u2019t doing too good at artful dodging, really. But at any rate, things were all right. I\nwas just getting around, and then finally wind \u2014 wound up back in the infantry when\nEisenhower declared that they had too many fliers, and \u2014 and that they were going to\npair \u2014 send all the fliers and [indecipherable] specialists, and all the special kinds of\npeople back to the infantry. Some of them had never been in the infantry when they\nwere put in. If you ever heard of the Battle of the Bulge \u2014",
        "Q: Oh yes.",
        "A: \u2014 there was a \u2014 there was a tremendous of them [indecipherable] to that. And to go\nin to a\u2014 toa war like that, that was murder. And \u2014 but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I was sent down to a\nregular infantry division that was only training. I-I \u2014",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see. Oh, this was late \u201943 or early \u00b044.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I joined this infantry unit, one of the last to go to Europe, actually, and\noddly enough, you know, was a late arrival, I was put into Patton\u2019s Third Army,\nwhich had one of the dreadful infantry scores \u2014 casualty scores.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you arrived in Europe \u2014 I want to establish this fact: you arrived in\nEurope when? In early *44?",
        "A: Let me see. Must have been.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we were the last division to arrive, so we were sort of a \u2014 a poor gift to the\narmy that got it. But we trained very hard, and I had had a little training before, so I\nfelt, they can train me to death if they want to, because I want to be equal to the job\nwhen I get it. So \u2014 but in the meantime there was this typewriter business. Now, if you\ncan imagine, they had, while we were in the States, they had the typewriter equipment,\nand they had this special articulated truck, one of those things that swings in all\ndirections, you know, to \u2014 to transport it. And I was tra \u2014 I was trained in how to park\nthis thing, and you know, to run it, in case they needed me. But \u2014 but they had a regular\nteam of transport people who \u2014 who normally handled this job. Well, I went into the\nfield in Mississippi, and did all these things, and that\u2019s the last I saw of the truck or the\n\u2014 or the computers, the \u2014",
        "Q: The wireless teletypers?",
        "A: The tele \u2014 wireless teletype. And they didn\u2019t \u2014 course they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t consult me\nin the service on anything, really, but I didn\u2019t know what ha \u2014 what happened to it, but\nthey had forgotten to cancel it or change it in some way. So there was always this little\nstrange thing, that I went abroad, I was \u2014 I was posted in the signal company of the 65\"\nJuly 7, 2011\ninfantry division, and got assignments occasionally, but it was not a \u2014 not terribly a\nbusy job for me. A division is about 14,000 men, so you can see they had a lot \u2014 lot of\npeople that do their normal work. And \u2014 and I never was pressed too much, because I\nhad this secret job. Nobody ever talked about it, 1t was just \u2014 I was just out in the cold, I\nguess. I got a couple of promotions.",
        "Q: Well, what did you do? This is wa \u2014 something I don\u2019t understand: when you were\nin the infantry, what was it that you were doing over there in Europe?",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 I was attached to this super-secret mission. So, I don\u2019t know, that was\nenough for me. But I was in \u2014 getting in a few \u2014 few firefights, but nothing \u2014",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t really see battle?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t see battle?",
        "A: Well, sure I f-fought. I was shot and \u2014 shot at and I shot back, and no, I had enough\nexperience so I could say I was an infantryman, but \u2014 but there I was encased 1n this\nsituation, and they \u2014",
        "Q: Well, what can you tell us \u2014 what can you tell us about this su \u2014 this secret mission?\nWhat was its goal, what was its purpose, what was \u2014",
        "A: Well, the thing was, they wanted to develop a wireless system, which would connect\nthe \u2014 the frontline troops with headquarters, and \u2014 in-instantly. And you can do it with\nJuly 7, 2011\nteletype, but you can\u2019t do it if you have to have lines between teletypes being cut by the\nenemy all the time.",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "A: And just laying the lines is too hideous a job. But this was obviously the beginning\nof a project that we were trying to analyze all the aspects, and see if they can straighten\nit out. I\u2014 I could understand, but I never \u2014 never thought it was terribly funny, but I\nhappen to be the beneficiary, so I wasn\u2019t going to argue about it. Well, as a result\nthough, I had a distorted military career, in which \u2014 during which I had the two\nexperiences that we \u2014 we were to talk about.",
        "Q: And that we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m hoping, yeah, that we can now. So di \u2014 does this \u2014 the fact that\nyou were 1n this \u2014 in this particular \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the right word is occupation or\nactivity, is that what brought you closer to \u2014 when we\u2019re going to talk about Ohrdruf,\nthat \u2014 why you happened to be there at \u2014 at that time.",
        "A: Well, you know, it\u2019s only because I got into this peculiar subculture \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 in the military. There were other people in the army, some fascinating people.\nThere \u2014 you can\u2019t imagine how some noncommissioned officers got positions of\nenormous authority, and it\u2019s because of that, in this instance, that I got into one of these\nthings. The one about the \u2014 the wor \u2014 the work projects of the \u2014 to so many of the\nHolocaust victims. And so from there on I was \u2014 I was part of an infantry unit, didn\u2019t\nJuly 7, 2011\nhave to go \u2014 di\u2014 wasn\u2019t callable and ba \u2014 and part of the [indecipherable] and really\njust give it \u2014 I had a lot of free time. And that was the real trouble. Free time and\nMcClure don\u2019t go together. So I went out, had some adventures. I was actually\nAWOL, I guess a ti \u2014 absent without leave.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "A: And \u2014 but nobody missed me, and \u2014",
        "Q: Were you in Germany?",
        "A: \u2014 I answered all the \u2014 you know, you get up in the morning, they blow the bugle,\nthey get you out, they \u2014 they check your name to make sure you\u2019re there. Then you go\nto breakfast, and then, of course, McClure vanishes.",
        "Q: Where did you vanish?",
        "A: My wer \u2014 might work on a keyboard, but he\u2019s not doing anything most infantry men\nwould respect. So, at any rate, the way I \u2014 I at some time will get to the \u2014 to these two\nthings, two very different experiences, quite profound. And \u2014",
        "Q: In all of this, you say you arrived in 1944, early in 1944, and probably it\u2019s a year and\nsome months later, maybe a year and three months later when you come onto Ohrdruf.\nIn that time, did you know, was it spoken of, was it known about, of what was\nhappening basically to the Jews and others in Europe? Was it \u2014 was \u2014 were you aware,\nwere others aware?\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s an interesting question because as an individual, I don\u2019t remember being\nterribly well-informed about \u2014 well, once \u2014 once they opened Auschwitz, all right. But\nbefore that \u2014 well, I was aware of the Saint Louis incident.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the criticism of Roosevelt because he didn\u2019t save those people, keep them from\ngoing back and dying, like they did.",
        "Q: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: And so I \u2014 I was aware of that, and of course I knew that the German propaganda\nwas all anti-Jewish. But this business of gathering up people just to kill them, I didn\u2019t \u2014\nwasn\u2019t aware of being aware of that. And in fact, when I \u2014 when \u2014 when we discovered\nthat the work quarters of these poor people in south Germany, first time we had\nencountered it \u2014 apparently, I don\u2019t know how they got away without being caught,\nbecau \u2014 of course, Germany is a very big country.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And \u2014 and we went after the cities first.",
        "Q: So tell us about \u2014 you say the first time you encountered this was in south\nGermany? So was that like Bavaria? In Bavaria is \u2014",
        "A: No, no, I \u2014 it\u2019s that province next to Bavaria that\u2019s a little south and east.",
        "Q: Baden Wurttemberg\u2019\u201d",
        "A: Yeah.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: That\u2019s a little southwest, closer to France.",
        "A: That\u2019s where Ohrdruf was.",
        "Q: Oh no, no, then we\u2019re going the other direction, then it\u2019s Thtirringen. Then \u2014 was\nOhrdruf the first time you came into contact with what this policy had been?",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah. And I wasn\u2019t the only one, I was \u2014 I was one of many, many \u2014\neverybody. Nobody \u2014",
        "Q: Can you \u2014 now can we go into some detail about this? You were \u2014 when you were\nalready almost there, what was your \u2014 what was your job? What were you doing when\nyou were called to go to Ohrdruf? What was y \u2014 what were you involved in?",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, that\u2019s the \u2014 the \u2014 the thing here, I referred to about th-the sub-class in\nthe army.",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "A: Some awfully smart people of very low rank got in, and it\u2019s amazing. He was in the\n\u20141-in g \u2014 G3, the \u2014 the operational side of the division. And he did some magnificent,\ngood work. He made sure everybody got decorations who were supposed to.",
        "Q: Who was this person?",
        "A: A young man from Chicago, ju \u2014 was just a name to me. I got to know him, but he\nwa \u2014 he worked on the \u201cChicago Tribune,\u201d and had \u2014 that was a fascinating \u2014\nsomething that I didn\u2019t know. Because, I guess he had good talent, he was taught to do\nall the main jobs on the paper. So that the \u2014 if the \u2014 if the printers went out on strike, he\nJuly 7, 2011\nwould go down and work a linotype machine. So, at any rate, he was a \u2014 a pretty \u2014\npretty savvy young guy, and had been kicked around a little bit, so he \u2014 he knew how to\n\u2014 how to handle problems. And \u2014 and he had a boss, a \u2014 I don\u2019t know, a colonel, or a\nlieutenant colonel who was very enamored of him for a while; this is a smart boy. And\nso he gradually elevated in authority. He was given [indecipherable] of things to do, th\n\u2014 his boss wanted results, and he was a results getter. And so, at any rate, by the time I\nga \u2014I got to know him pretty well, because of my interest in journalism, I found he had\nbeen with the \u201cChicago Tribune,\u201d which was not the New York Tribune \u2014 \u201cHerald\nTribune.\u201d",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But \u2014 but we had a similar interest, and we joked about \u2014 about journalism, and so\non. And so it got so, for little things. I was mostly idle, in another part of the camp. The\n\u2014 the camp is a city, really. And he\u2019d call on me if he ever had something that \u2014 a job to\ndo, that he couldn\u2019t do or \u2014 so \u2014 so we got pretty chummy. Then one day a-\u2014 one day a\nJeep showed up first thing in the morning. I \u2014 I was just finishing breakfast, I guess,\nand I was being called by my friend. So I got in the Jeep, and off we went, over to his\nheadquarters, and he told me we \u2014 we\u2019 ve discovered some anomaly here, strange thing,\na lot of people dying and I don\u2019t know, we just got a radio report on this thing at \u2014 I\nneed this \u2014 h-he \u2014 he described it. Well, he said he \u2014 he wanted to send me over there to\ntake a picture of this thing. He said we should have pictures of it. So he gave me a no \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011\na German 35 millimeter camera, one of the best that they make. And \u2014 but it had film in\nit, I didn\u2019t know the speed of the film, and that was a big handicap because I knew I\ncouldn\u2019t take many pictures in the shadow, if \u2014 if \u2014 1f that was standard film. So, off I\nwent, and they had a driver, really quite incredible. He had surveyed the route to this\nplace by \u2014 by using a \u2014 automobile company maps. And so we went right there, 1t was\nno problem, he made no mistakes, he drove right there. And we got into the area, we\ndidn\u2019t know where the camp was, but we saw all of the military equipment that had\nbeen gathering.",
        "Q: So, by the military equipment, do you mean U.S. military?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And how long, you know, from where your unit was to where this camp was,\nwas it a half hour drive, was it an hour drive, do you remember? Was it \u2014",
        "A: It was \u2014I\u2014I\u2014I-as I-\u2014I feel it now, it seemed to be about half an hour, 45 minutes.\nThough I \u2014 I could be wrong about that.",
        "Q: Yeah. But anyway, it wasn\u2019t half a day. It wasn\u2019t something that was very far away.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have to eat or anything.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: So, well, I came upon this rugged terrain. We got off the main drive. He wa \u2014 he\nwas absolutely sure of where he would find it, and he came \u2014 he came into an area\nwhere we saw a lot of \u2014 a couple of tanks, and a lot of other motorized equipment,\nAmerican, and we figured we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d hit something. And then we were \u2014 were led by\nthe locals, wha-whatever G.I.s we could find, and led to this place. Well, it was very\nremote in the woods, and the little building, all of raw wood. And they had a huge gate,\nwith a slogan, let\u2019s see if I can remember. It\u2019s a very simple slogan in German, and\n[indecipherable] although most people had to deal with it. Arbeit \u2014 something about\narbeit that \u2014 well, work is a liberator, or \u2014",
        "Q: Arbeit macht frei.",
        "A: Yeah, that macht frei, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Arbeit macht frei.",
        "A: Arbeit macht frei. And there was this \u2014 that\u2019s the only metal I could remember,\neverything else was just wood. And I learned also later that they built hundreds of these\non the same plans, so that if you encountered one in one place, it looked like the same\nyou saw before. And \u2014",
        "Q: So, was like a wooden building? Did it look like a storehouse, or a warehouse?",
        "A: No, no, it didn\u2019t have any distinction or appearance of authority or anything like\nthat. It was just a little \u2014 I want to say, a crudely built architecturally nil kind of\nJuly 7, 2011\nconstruction. And it \u2014 it was designed for its purpose, which it was just to house the\nHolocaust victims.",
        "Q: So, did you open the \u2014 did you open a door to it?",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t do anything. I arrived, I was just another G.I. I \u2014 well, I was more than\nthat, I was a \u2014 I think I was a sergeant by then, but I was just another guy dressed in all\nthe same clothes that everybody else was, and I liked that because nobody asked any\nquestions. I wasn\u2019t part of the rescue team though, and I had free access, I could go\naround, take pictures wherever I wanted. I \u2014",
        "Q: What\u2019s the first picture you took?",
        "A: First picture I took was of the \u2014 of the grave. There was about, oh, I would say about\n800 feet long, very long, and very deep, and about 15 feet wide.",
        "Q: And what did you see in it?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: What did you see?",
        "A: Well, bodies. In fact, I\u2014 I had no trouble understanding what it was for, because\nthey were in the process of dumping more bodies in, all of them naked. They take \u2014\nthey took off the rags that they had been wearing, washed them, and then they\u2019d use\nthem again, you see. But th \u2014",
        "Q: So when you came aco \u2014 across this first scene that you took a photograph of, there\nwas actual dumping of bodies going on in the \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Yes, oh yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Was this now the U.S. military that was cleaning it out?",
        "A: Oh, there were. There was a lot of work to do, because there were many bodies in\nthis \u2014 in the barracks. Barracks were three \u2014 three stages high, as I remember, and they\nwere just lay \u2014 laid out on the floor of th \u2014 each level. And some of them were so weak,\nthey couldn\u2019t get up to eat.",
        "Q: So, when you were in the barracks there were people who were alive, as well as\npeople who were dead.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, they were dying. That\u2019s what they were doing, it was \u2014",
        "Q: Was this men or women?",
        "A: All \u2014 all \u2014 all \u2014 both.",
        "Q: Both men \u2014 any children?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t notice any children. I think they disposed of the children very quickly. I\nknow \u2014",
        "Q: When you say \u2014 excuse me that I\u2019m interrupting \u2014 when you say three stages, do\nyou mean that there were \u2014 the bunks were in three bunks \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 and that people were on each level?",
        "A: Three tiers.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Yeah. Now, of course, the stronger ones so happened to be on the top, because they\ncould still get down, but \u2014 but there were a lot of them even in the \u2014 on the lowest level,\nwho were just comatose. Ju-Just a terr \u2014 it\u2019s a terrible sight. These are people who\nshould be dead, but were alive.",
        "Q: Did you take pictures there too?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Did you take pictures of them?",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t, because I wasn\u2019t sure of the \u2014 of the film.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah. I figured it was not a ver \u2014 a super speed, that\u2019s what you need for that, in\norder \u2014",
        "Q: Because it would be inside, and darker, yeah.",
        "A: Your light, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s almost no light in there. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 I took some\npictures, but they didn\u2019t come out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And do you have an idea of about how many bodies you saw, or how many\npeople you saw in there? Was it stuffed to the gills? Was it a hundred, 200? Was it 50?\nI know those are abstra \u2014 you know, sort of estimates, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, hard to tell.",
        "Q: \u2014 to get a sense of a \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Hard to tell how many there were. I went in, I took a look, I saw some of them, and I\ncame out.",
        "Q: Did any move to you? Did anybody want to talk to you?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, not \u2014 not \u2014 I mean, they didn\u2019t campaign, but you could see they\u2019d\nlook at you with those empty eyes, and beg you, really, to help. But th \u2014 they were very\npleased, they were \u2014 by \u2014 by the time I got there, the operational troops had called for\nhelp, and they got some \u2014 some very skilled medical people, by the way. They couldn\u2019t\ndo much for the ones that were dying, of course, but they were dying, and they had to\nbe disposed of, because it was a very great danger, biological danger. So, when I got\nthere, I \u2014 the one thing I remember, the one, looked like pretty husky guy, a man,\nmaybe in his middle 30s, something like that, carrying a skeleton. Dang \u2014 skeleton was\njust dangling there. And then \u2014 then tossed it into the trap, you know, into the \u2014",
        "Q: By trap, do you mean that 800 foot long \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, di\u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 ditch that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was the grave.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a\u2014 and somebody, they put in lime. And I saw this, and I think that was\nearly enough so that \u2014 it isn\u2019t the way it necessarily looked at the end. But \u2014",
        "Q: So this is before the lime starts taking effect?\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: This is before the lime starts doing what it does?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right, 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 th-there \u2014 there was some lime underneath. Th-This \u2014\nthe depth of this, human depth was maybe three or four feet already, so a lot of bodies\nunderneath that al \u2014 already been disposed of, and I don\u2019t know how long that gash had\nbeen there. I suspect that 1t was there be \u2014 before the guards left. They \u2014 they got a\nwarning that the Americans were coming.",
        "Q: Can \u2014 do you have a sense of how long the U.S. military was already there before\nyou arrived?",
        "A: Well, not to my \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too long.",
        "Q: A day?",
        "A: A\u2014no, no, not a day. They \u2014 the tank came on it \u2014 what was that hour, I don\u2019t\nknow. It could \u2014 I think it was a man who became General Abrams, who was the\ncommander of the tank. He was then a captain, or something. And then he had other\ntrucks, cars with him, with troops. Let\u2019s see. I think it was fairly late in the day when he\ncame on, or possibly even later.",
        "Q: In the evening, maybe.",
        "A: Yeah, right. And he immediately re \u2014 radioed back to headquarters, and \u2014 and they\nof course notified the division command. And that\u2019s the way I got the word myself,\nJuly 7, 2011\nvery first thing in the morning. We \u2014 so they must have been there, couldn\u2019t have been\ndoing very much, because of the darkness.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I suppose they were \u2014 they must have been suspicious too. A lot of serious\ntrouble going on one place, you know, and th \u2014 and after dark, you don\u2019t dare endanger\nyourself. But at any rate they \u2014 they notified us. They used their own medics in the \u2014\nthe little group that arrived.",
        "Q: Do you remember the date?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Do you remember the date this was? [technical interruption]\nEnd of File One\nJuly 7, 2011\nBeginning File Two",
        "Q: I\u2019m just going to say something here, okay? This is a continuation of the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Brooks McClure. We\u2019re on\na separate track, that\u2019s why we\u2019re go \u2014 so, I was asking you about the date. Do you\nhave an idea about when this was?",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t keep track of dates. I\u2014 I could be a week off \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014 at any time.",
        "Q: But it was April.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: It was April, you think.",
        "A: I th\u2014I seem to remember that it was April. I was looking \u2014 incidentally, I didn\u2019t\nmention this, but I had a few notes, and I had some of the pictures that I took, in my\nfiles. And my wife died, and I got sick, and so I didn\u2019t follow up very much on this.\nHad to sell the house and \u2014 and move into an old people\u2019s home. So, I \u2014 I \u2014I wasn\u2019t\naware of this very much, but unfortunately a lot of the files that I preev \u2014 prized, were\nlost. And so I would have had the date, and a \u2014 a lot \u2014 lot of other things in there. I \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t imagine my not noting that down, because this was such an unusual experience.",

        "Q: Was it cold still?",
        "A: Huh?",

        "A: Oh, it was always dank.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Sort of chilly, you know. I do \u2014 there was certainly in the air, and it was in \u2014 I\nsuppose even in \u2014 it might have been in spring, you know, the weather.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I was wearing a re-regular uniform, no coat or anything. So I\u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\ncouldn\u2019t have been very cold. But those poor people, oh my heavens.",
        "Q: Did anybody try to speak with you from those \u2014 from \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Usually in a language I didn\u2019t understand. A lot of them were Poles, ge \u2014\nGermans, Russians.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you think you sa \u2014 maybe there were Soviet soldiers who were in the\ngroup, too?",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s quite possible. The Germans were not very respectful of the \u2014 of the\nRussians \u2014",
        "Q: No.",

        "A: Not \u2014 not very long.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: We were \u2014 we were on the move. The \u2014 the \u2014 the army as itself, was moving very\nfast. And that\u2019s why I think they \u2014 they overtook some people that were trying to get\naway. And Patton moved at times, 50 miles in a day. Now, if you can imagine a\nmilitary force of maybe clo-close to a half a million men \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: \u2014 moving this fast, and actually, if you read up on it, it\u2019s quite interesting in\nretrospect, to see how well the Americans did. They fought like fiends. The Germans\nde-defending their own country, didn\u2019t do nearly as well.",

And ul \u2014 a lot of the \u2014 the guards seemed\nto have rooms or something down in the town of Ohrdruf, o-h-r-d-r-u-f, as |\nremember the spelling. And some of them dashed down and changed their clothes, and\njust mingled with the local people. And s \u2014 but very soon the Americans realized what\nhad happened, and they sent a tank down and they put them on the tank, brought them\nback \u2014 the ones they could find. They fu \u2014 found quite a number apparently. This all\nhappened before I arrived.",

        "Q: Very quickly.",
        "A: \u2014no delay. I thought the military did a wonderful job. They didn\u2019t pause for a\nminute. And they brought them back dressed in their [indecipherable] uniforms, and \u2014\nand civilian clothes. And this town, by the way, is a lovely little paradise, beautifully\nkept. They all had flower \u2014 window flower arrangements. And \u2014 and it was really a\nwonderful place to go to. They had the [indecipherable] and then the \u2014 all the\narrangements. And so \u2014 and they had a full population town, I guess, mostly middle\naged people, women and men. But \u2014",

        "A: I'd say about two miles now, my guess \u2014 my guess 1s. I don\u2019t know how you \u2014 one\nmeasures distance when you\u2019re walking \u2014",
        "Q: Did you walk it?",
        "A: \u2014 especially when you\u2019re a young man.",
        "Q: Did you walk it?",
        "A: Oh, I walked it, sure.",
        "Q: About how long did it take you to get from the town to the camp?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know why I walked it, because we had a car. But \u2014 but I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I went down \u2014 maybe I\u2019m a \u2014 had company. I can\u2019t remember\nnow.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: But, at any rate, I got down there, and I remember entering the town from one end,\nand seeing how beautiful it was, and how fiendish the whole idea seemed to be. At a-\nany rate \u2014",
        "Q: The guards \u2014 excuse me that I\u2019m interrupting, but we go back to the guards. They\nwere brought back in civilian clothes to the camp. Did anybody recognize them and\nidentify them, from the \u2014 from those dying people?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, that\u2019s what I was about to say. There were some of the Holocaust\nvictims who were at least strong enough to stand up and move around. And when the \u2014\nwhen the Americans brought these people in, I heard, and I \u2014 and thi-this is not my\nJuly 7, 2011\npersonal experience, but they attacked them. And at first the Americans had to\nintervene, and stop it and so forth. And \u2014 but that didn\u2019t appease the \u2014 the victims at all,\nof course. The \u2014 but all of this is hearsay. I wa \u2014 I\u2014I heard this when I \u2014 when a \u2014\nwhen we arrived.",
        "Q: Another question. Maybe my final one that has to do with Ohrdruf, unless Joe has\nsome more, 1s when peop \u2014 when the Americans came, the G.I.s \u2014 no, I have two more.\nWhen the Americans came, and they saw this, did they have any idea of what it was\nthat they were seeing?",
        "A: No. No. Of course, the first thing you see is the dead and dying.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And these were obviously not people armed, so they weren\u2019t soldiers in the normal\nsense. And they were all dressed in these curious uniforms, with the stripes going\ndown, you know. And so they \u2014 they were \u2014 must have been aware that these were\nprisoners who had revolted, or something. I-It was hard to piece together a story, even\nwhen I was there. And the next day, a passel of \u2014 of generals came to see it.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s my second question.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Does the name Franks say anything to you? Franks, as a last name.",
        "A: French?",
        "Q: Franks. Frank, with an S at the end.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Like \u2014 like the country?",
        "Q: No, no, not like the country, like the hamber \u2014 no, like the hot dog. A frank.",
        "A: Oh, the franks.",
        "Q: Yeah, does the name Franks say anything to you?",
        "A: No, no, I di\u2014 I never met a Frank knowingly.",
        "Q: Okay. Because I had heard that there was \u2014 this was a person who was responsible\nfor getting some of the higher-ups to come to Ohrdruf and Buchenwald.",
        "A: Oh, well, I may have. I ma \u2014 oh, no, Buchenwald is something else again. This is an\nentirely separate and belated development.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So no, the next day they got Patton, Bradley, I think \u2014 what\u2019s that? Field Marshall\nMontgomery, and then a couple of others, because they found that 1t was something\nvery unusual. Actually, how it escaped their notice so long, I don\u2019t know, because our\npatrols extended far in. But I suppose er \u2014 if 1t had been er \u2014 discovered ear-earlier, it\nwould have been a little bit \u2014 bit of a situation. For one thing, maybe the response,\nbecause of the time of day, would have been quicker. They \u2014 they rea \u2014 they \u2014 they\nrecognized \u2014 the medics that they had were just regular combat medics, and they knew\nthey couldn\u2019t do a great deal. All they did was recognize the principle that after a\ncertain point of not eating, you are doomed.",
        "Q: Right. Yeah.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: And \u2014 and there were a lot of doomed people around there. Oh, it was really awful.\nAnd, you know \u2014 well, you\u2019ve all seen pictures of these people; they\u2019re so thin, it\u2019s\nunbelievable. Their veins stood out on their arms and everything.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] didn\u2019t seem human. And I wonder how they got along. There was\na good mixture of languages, but you\u2019d have to organize it among the survivors, a few\ncould speak English or French. Otherwise, they were out of communication, really, I\nthink. Maybe some of the Germans mixed in would have been re-reasonable",
        "Q: How long did you stay there?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: How long did you stay there?",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t stay very long at all. Took my pictures. I knew they wanted them back\nat headquarters, and so I \u2014 I just about jumped in the car, and off we went.",
        "Q: So were you there a couple hours, perhaps, or half a day?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Not very much at all. I realized early on that I couldn\u2019t spend much time\nin \u2014 inside these buildings.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So it was more than one building?",
        "A: Oh well, I think so. I think there was. I only went into one, but it was a \u2014 it was a\npretty sizable thing. I don\u2019t know how many workers they had to have, or they were\nusing for whatever project they were doing. They were \u2014 they were probably cleaning\nJuly 7, 2011\nout the \u2014 the ... the woods, you know, because the Germans do that. They make it a\npolicy, clean out the underbrush wherever they are, and they use it, of course,\nprofitably, to burn. But \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t have been \u2014 I don\u2019t know where the \u2014 how \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how \u2014 how the civilians managed. They \u2014 the tradition in Germany is to go\ninto the woods and clean it out. Well, you know, if \u2014 if the \u2014 if the camp was two miles\naway, I don\u2019t know how they would escape being discovered, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an\nissue. These \u2014 the \u2014 the townspeople all knew about this. I understand that afterwards,\nthe Americans took the Burgermeister and a number of senior civilian officers up to\nwatch this process that I watched; they were still burying these people.",
        "Q: Did you ever write about this after the war?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you ever write about this?",
        "A: No, I never did. I never did. But I \u2014 but I \u2014 I think that after the war it was well\nknown, and wasn\u2019t quite as dramatic as hanging them with piano wire in Auschwitz.\nBut the \u2014 the whole thing is unbelievable, more-so \u2014 you know, one says that it\u2019s\nunbelievable that a group of people would be killed this way, for nothing other than\nbeing what they are. And that binary nature of these people, who could be very polite\nand \u2014 and com \u2014 polite society, in their polite society, and yet they \u2014 th-there was \u2014 the\nGermans did an analysis of one of their big meetings and it survived the war, and I saw\nit in Germany, in fact. This was after the war. And it was appalling to see these people\nJuly 7, 2011\nwho were responsible for th-th-the disposal of human beings, joking about it and going\nabout it in such a detached way. No \u2014 no \u2014 no emotion involved. Well, but at any rate,\nthat\u2019s not pertinent to what we\u2019re talking about, but \u2014",
        "Q: It is, but it is not \u2014 it\u2019s not direct witness, it is the impressions that you get after the\nfact.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: So it ties in, it ties in.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. It didn\u2019t have to be a visual presentation at all.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You just think of the idea, planning and executing these people in such a way.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And this was the other way. These were the dregs. These were \u2014 these were not the\npeople who were employed in [indecipherable] plants all through Germany, or \u2014 there\n\u2014 there were a lot of commercial properties that were managed and run by these people.\nSome fantastic stories about that, but seeing it is an emotional experience.",
        "Q: Did you talk about it to your folks when you came home, to your home?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: My mother was the only one left, so \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: When \u2014 when Patton moved on at that clip, that pretty fast clip of moving, you\nknow, such a wall of humanity forward, 50 mi \u2014 did you go forward as well, as part of\nthat?",
        "A: No, well, the country is vast.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We had the \u2014 the \u2014 the third army had the southern quarter of Germany to take care\nof. We \u2014 we were \u2014 were \u2014 we were at one point closest to Berlin, then moved down,\non orders, of course.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And Patton was assigned this last southeastern quarter of Germany, and what went\nwith it, a little bit of Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and Austria, of course.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Austrian experience is also \u2014 that\u2019s where they have separate comment.",
        "Q: Id like to get there.",
        "A: We were all a little anxious, I suppose. We were doing very well, but when you\u2019re in\na battle, if you\u2019re moving forward, you feel pretty good about that, but your \u2014 you\u2019re\nfurther exposing yourself to doom. And the \u2014 I was \u2014 I was not aware of \u2014 of this\nsweep, but I knew it happened. And in fact, after \u2014 after the Battle of the Bulge, our \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011\nour \u2014 our army \u2014 I\u20141I\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m afraid I \u2014I shouldn\u2019t say our army, I wasn\u2019t in the army,\nbut I \u2014 in that army, but because I \u2014 of my personal experience. But oh, the casualties\nwere fearsome. And the men who really fought have a different, instinctive feeling\nabout it. But our infan \u2014 infantry really ch \u2014 went through them so fast, that we had\nsome surprises. We overtook the \u2014 the retreat of the Germans. They\u2019d retreat a while,\nthen they\u2019d surrender. And so \u2014 but as I say, in \u2014 in Austria they got another picture of\nit.",
        "Q: What happened in Austria?",
        "A: Because they were \u2014 these were civilians and \u2014 and the Austrians that were in the\narmy were, of course, in the German army. And so they didn\u2019t have much to do in\nAustria. I know wa \u2014 in our experience, the Austrian takeover was a cinch, after the\nfighting that we had done before.",
        "Q: Was this already \u2014 if you were in Ohrdruf in a \u2014 in April, where did you \u2014 when the\nwar ended in early May, do you remember that, where you were at the time?",
        "A: Yes, I was in Linz, Austria.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Sure. Sure, I \u2014 the \u2014 the end of war 1s really the end of war for \u2014 for the Austrians,\nthere was nothing. And all the pretty girls, some very eager to cooperate ger \u2014\nAustrians, but not \u2014 not resisting. We had to face the possibility that we\u2019d have to fight\nJuly 7, 2011\nthrough it, but they didn\u2019t have \u2014 they did \u2014 they didn\u2019t have a home guard or anything,\nto give us any trouble, so [inaudible]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk then about that second \u2014 second episode \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, that\u2019s a different thing entirely, and \u2014 and in retrospect, it\u2019s a funny\nexperience. I enjoyed it so much afterwards, because 1t was so dangerous when it was\ndone.",
        "Q: So tell us about that.",
        "A: I\u2014 we were \u2014 we were stationed in Linz, in western Austria, and I was \u2014 I \u2014 I had\nattached myself to the \u2014 to the intelligence section of the army. And get \u2014 got to know a\nvery affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too. He was an\ninfantry officer, a big man. I \u2014 apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety\nunder extreme pressure. But at any rate, I reported in one day. It was across town, I was\nwith ya \u2014 with my infantry friends, and \u2014 eating there and so forth. So I came in one\nmorning, about eight o\u2019clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can\u2019t\nremember \u2014 and that\u2019s a shame, you know, that just \u2014 should never forget the name of\nsomebody who made such an impression. But at any rate, he was a good \u2014 good old\nboy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he\nlooked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much\nappreciated. So, he had come into the office just before me, and he got a call from the\ndirector of the museum. And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him\nJuly 7, 2011\nthis way, but he heard about the \u2014 the exchange of troops. We had gone on the \u2014 on the\nu-upper Austrian side of the Donau river, and had \u2014 the Russians had moved in too far\nwhen we \u2014 when we met. There was a clerical error. So that was passed. The Russians\nwere in that territory, we didn\u2019t try to throw them out, of course. But they were\nadvanced maybe \u2014 maybe a couple of miles on \u2014 on what was supposed to be a straight\nline of division. And so they now \u2014 now decided that they would settle all this at the\nvery highest level. Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they\u2019d better\nchange this. So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it,\nthe Russians would pull back, and we would mo \u2014 we\u2019d move forward into that area.\nAnd when \u2014 although we didn\u2019t know anything, or I didn\u2019t know anything, of course,\nlet me say that when I say we don\u2019t know, that means I don\u2019t know. But at any rate, I\ndidn\u2019t know there were planning to do this, they didn\u2019t consult me. And so, both the\nmajor and I were very upset. What happened was, when we first came in, the major\nwent over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly\nreasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to\nhave been put there by Hitler. And \u2014 excuse \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: The director at that time said that no, there were no pictures, but that we could see\nthat there were spaces where pictures had been. And we didn\u2019t know what \u2014 what wa \u2014\nhappened to them. So \u2014 but nevertheless, any amount of questioning as the director,\nJuly 7, 2011\nproduced no answers. And then of course, suddenly, the \u2014 there came this change, and\nhe discovered what he knew, or something, that the pictures were in a certain farm wa \u2014\nin a\u20141na barn, couple of miles in \u2014 1n that area. And so he said \u2014",
        "Q: Where the Russians were \u2014 where the Soviets were.",
        "A: Yeah, right. And he had \u2014 he had the \u2014 in fact, address. He knew exactly how to get\nthere. He\u2019d obviously checked somebody. What they were, were cases, beautifully\nmade, of wood, for each picture, whether it\u2019s small or large, and were beveled off so\nthat they wouldn\u2019t hurt anything. And he said, he se \u2014 he was sort of apologetic because\nhe knew he should have revealed this before. Although I do \u2014 I think if that had\nhappened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him\naway. So we\u2019re probably lucky that this happened. And \u2014 and so, they \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m\nsurprised they didn\u2019t have Russian guards on \u2014 on these things. But, at any rate \u2014",
        "Q: Did he ask \u2014 was his request to your Irish American major that \u2014 that the Americans\ngo and get his pictures back? Was that what the request was?",
        "A: No, it was a sort of a\u2014 a spontaneous reaction of idiocy by everybody there, you\nknow, they \u2014 they really \u2014 we all agreed.",
        "Q: That you had to get the pictures back?",
        "A: Yeah, had to get the pictures back. And I don\u2019t know what happened to me. I \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot prone to make profound decisions like this, but \u2014 but he went around, and asked\neach soldier, do you want to go? It\u2019s a little dangerous, but let\u2019s go.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: And this is your major? Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, this fella, he didn\u2019t know any more than I did really, but at any rate, he\u2019s a\nvery low rank in that big army, and he was making an awful decision. But he \u2014 we\ncould have all been wiped out. Was the craziest thing, going over the Linz bridge, to\nthe other side of the Donau, and feeling that you might be going to your death.\nAnyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or\nsomething, whatever had been assigned to them. And it was a \u2014 I thought it was a\ncomical thing afterwards, but I didn\u2019t think that \u2014 very much that way at the time. So\nwe all went in a little convoy, with the major out ahead in a Jeep, and most of us back\nin the trucks. We had two big trucks, and we didn\u2019t know how much we were going to\nface. Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were\ndriving, I wouldn\u2019t have been that \u2014 that \u2014 that good. But we arrived in there, in the top\nof an enormous barn. You know the way those barns were constructed? They used the\nupper levels for hay that they dropped down in the spring. And so there were the\npictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow \u2014 for the \u2014 the bulls, or what have you. And\nthe \u2014 we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not\nthe \u2014 the heaviest thing was an unusual shape. It was about two feet wide, two feet\nhigh, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh. We c \u2014 we \u2014 we could move\nthe pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn\u2019t know what it was, we couldn\u2019t take\nthe time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take \u2014 take it. So for\nJuly 7, 2011\nour two and a half ton truck, we \u2014 we put it on the \u2014 the \u2014 down early. But it took all the\nmuscular strength we could master. And so when we got back, w-we drove back, and\nthat was a terrorizing experience, because there was nothing but death. Nothing moved\nin that whole distance that we had \u2014",
        "Q: You did \u2014 did you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that \u2014 that they had evacuated.",
        "Q: So no people were there, at the \u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: No people were at the farmhouse, or \u2014",
        "A: No, no, well, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some took the alternative of going into the cellar, to be\ndiscovered later. But an awful lot of them went visiting the relatives and friends in the\nsafe part of town.",
        "Q: No Soviet soldiers?",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you see any Soviet soldiers?",
        "A: No, I saw \u2014 I didn\u2019t even see an \u2014 an ordinary dog. You know, they \u2014 the little street\ndogs everywhere.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we saw nothing breeding in that area.",
        "Q: The dogs went visiting too?\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, they went visiting or \u2014 or hid in the cellar, too. But at any rate, it\nwas just a naked run really, from the safe sa \u2014 place, to this \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t too long,\nand so I figure a couple miles, maybe. Then we loaded it all up, and came back. And of\ncourse, that was the loneliest automobile trip I ever made. And so we went across the\nbridge and got back, and we \u2014 we decided to put it in the museum, we could put a guard\non it there. And we didn\u2019t have anybody el \u2014 of the ability to examine them, and we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t want to \u2014 there, there was a \u2014 was a big station in \u2014 in south Germany, near\nMunich. Munich th \u2014 yielded an awful lot of those paintings. And they had \u2014 there we\nhad some American \u2014 those specialists, who knew these paintings, you know. You\nneeded somebody like that to make a judgment.",
        "Q: Did you open up the cases, though?",
        "A: No, but we did open up one. The major said, that damn thing that [indecipherable]\nand so forth. He wanted to see what was in it, so we opened it. Was a beautifully\nencased box. And what was it? It was a rowing machine with a [indecipherable] iron\nbase, that apparently the officers wanted to take with them, or get rid of, or something.\nDidn\u2019t want to yield to the Russians, maybe. So in all that happened, we had a good\nlaugh after.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Bu-But [indecipherable], it tied us up for a while.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: So was this \u2014 did this whole thing es \u2014 did this whole adventure take half a day? A\nday?",
        "A: Oh, well you can be sure we did it as fast as we could.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that \u2014 see, that was early in the morning when we first got the word, and the\nmajor took no \u2014 no time making arrangements with the motor office. And, we were up\nand gone in \u2014 1n a matter, I\u2019m afraid, of minutes. Every able-bodied soldier 1n the area\nwere \u2014 well, at least there was a mass of early risers, you know. And the major went\naround, asked each one of them, you know, why they \u2014 why they do this.",
        "Q: Any flak about it \u2014",
        "A: And he guessed right. Huh \u2014 huh?",
        "Q: Any flak about it from the higher ups later?",
        "A: None \u2014 none that I heard of. I didn\u2019t stay on very much longer. I got reassigned to\nFrance. I was going to go home, and they put me in a safer place, I guess. But oh, I\nwas \u2014 that was quite an experience.",
        "Q: Quite an adventure.",
        "A: Oh yeah. And I \u2014I \u2014 I thought it was, thinking about it afterwards, I thought it was\npretty darn clever of these fellows to say yes, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 then it\u2019s a very freaky\nthing. I\u2019m sure that if you ask the same people, a lot of them would have said no. But\nthat\u2019s th \u2014 I know how those things happen.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "Q: Well, when you\u2019re young, and the war is over, it sort of \u2014 1t can go with the territory.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It can go \u2014 so tell me, when did you return back to the States? Did you stay in\nEurope much longer after the war ended?",
        "A: Well, I was assigned to a place in Mourmelon in France. I then was shipped to\nParis, and got a job as an editor on the \u201cStars and Stripes,\u201d which I thought was a\ndelightful way to finish up with the army. And then in due course I had enough credits\nto come home. Was a lovely assignment there. I don\u2019t know what happened to the\nteletypes. They just never showed up.",
        "Q: I guess not. Well, 1s there anything else you\u2019d like to add to \u2014 to this story that\nwe ve talked about this morning?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. There \u2014 there\u2019s an after play, you might say. I stayed on in \u2014 in\nAustria for quite a time, and these people got out of their cages, and they\u2019d just walk\naround, stupefied. I don\u2019t know how they ate. I \u2014 I was a nonsmoker, and it \u2014 but I took\nmy smoking rations. And cigarettes were worth an awful lot of money. You could get a\ndinner, a whole dinner, for a cigarette in some places. And I had no use for them, so \u2014\nso I\u2014I-\u2014I gave mine away, rather than destroy them. And they di \u2014 they\u2019d know, as\nsoon as they saw the cigarettes, I was being a friendly \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know how they were\ntreated by other soldiers, you know? And it\u2019s a terribly disturbing thing if somebody\nJuly 7, 2011\ncomes up and says in a perfectly modulated civilian voice, something obviously\nunderstandable, if you could understand the language. It\u2019s a terrible feeling.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Sometimes they just want a sa \u2014 a cigarette, or some \u2014 or a \u2014 or \u2014 they\u2019d never ask\nfor a cigarette. They\u2019d get it if somebody gave it to them. It was much too valuable a\npiece of property.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking now about people who had been prisoners?",
        "A: Yes, right, and \u2014",
        "Q: Former prisoners.",
        "A: \u2014 didn\u2019t speak a language that I understood.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: By then I could get along all right for primitive things in da \u2014 German.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I had studied it, and so I ha \u2014 had an advantage. But I don\u2019t know, it \u2014 it seems\nunreal. I don\u2019t even think I \u2014 sometimes I don\u2019t think I ha \u2014 I went there.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not \u2014 you know, there are people I\u2019ve talked to who have been survivors of some\nof these camps, and they say the same thing. Sometimes they say, I wonder if this really\nhappened to me.",
        "A: Yeah. Right.",
        "Q: You know.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Funny experience.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, thank you. Thank you so much \u2014",

And Mr.\nMcClure, thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today. I\u2019m going to start\nthe interview as fairy tales do, at the very beginning. And that\u2019s going to be to ask you\nyour \u2014 when you were born, the date you were born, what was your family like, and\nwe'll take it from there.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "Q: So you were 21 years old?",
        "Q: And had you liv \u2014 when you said New York City, were you \u2014 did you grow up in\nManhattan, or in the outer boroughs?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Had you done \u2014 attended college? Had you finished high school?",
        "Q: Did he \u2014 excuse me \u2014 did he have his own business, your father?",
        "Q: No. He worked for somebody else.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pretty impressive.",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "Q: Absolutely right. Absolutely right.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t even 20 years old? You were like 18.",
        "Q: But chutzpah. A lot of chutzpah.",
        "Q: So, Id like to turn this now to \u2014 as you\u2019re speaking, a number of thoughts are going\nthrough my mind. When I\u2019ve interviewed other people who were part of liberating\nforces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did,\nto news, to world events, to \u2014 1t \u2014 to people who were different from yourselves. So one\nof the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to Europe, did\nyou meet anybody who was Jewish. Well, if you live in Manhattan, chances are you\ndid.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And then my second question 1s, is that if you were interested in news and\njournalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of\nwhat Germany was doing?",

        "Q: Well, William Shirer, I think, was based in Berlin at the time.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So I\u2019d like to turn it back to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and\nhis role in your education. And \u2014 did these \u2014 these events, these world events that you\nare talking about, not only in Europe but elsewhere, but of course for us it\u2019s\nparticularly what was going on in Europe; were you discussing these at home?",
        "Q: Yeah, it is. It is. To have got \u2014 to have \u2014 to have conversations around the dinner\ntable about important events of the day is something that doesn\u2019t happen that often any\nmore.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So, did you write \u2014 after that first article that you sent to the Australian newspaper,\ndid you become their correspondent? Did you end up submitting pieces?",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t ask the basic questions.",

        "Q: Trial and error.",
        "Q: Does this mean your journalistic career was born with that article?",
        "Q: Is that where the battle was taking place?",
        "Q: In Algeria, okay.",
        "Q: You never saw that piece as it ran?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: It \u2014 it \u2014 this is \u2014 it is all very relevant, because it brings me to the next point. And\nthat is, you had mentioned earlier that your dad passed away in 1940, and that your life\nchanged at that time.",
        "Q: And I wanted to \u2014 I wanted to ask in which way it had changed, and how did you \u2014\ndid you have to leave journalism then? Did you have t \u2014 did you make decisions to go\ninto the military, were you drafted? I want to bring \u2014 get us to the place where you\u2019re\nending up in Europe, and t \u2014 and tell me what the sequence of events was.",
        "Q: And they were?",
        "Q: Did you stay \u2014 where did you live in Manhattan? Was it in \u2014",
        "Q: And where is that?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: Is it near the Bronx?",
        "Q: Near the Bronx? Is it near the Bronx?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I know the area now. I get a better sense of that. I wanted to then \u2014 you were looking\nfor \u2014 you were looking for a job. Did you eventually find one?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, so that\u2019s 1942.",
        "Q: And where were \u2014 were you stateside for a while?",
        "Q: Were you based in the \u2014 in the U.S. for a while?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: Skill, mm-hm.",
        "Q: But they\u2019re not in the army.",
        "Q: The teletypes probably.\nA2: The teletypes.",
        "Q: Was it the teletypes?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Private first class?",

        "Q: Was this post-war?",
        "Q: Joining the air force was post-war, or during the war?",
        "Q: Because the in \u2014 can I just \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 clarify? Because being in the infantry would have been the worst possible\nsituation. Is that \u2014 1-1f I understand this properly? It was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 not the \u2014 the least of \u2014 le-let me see if I can rephrase that. Is it if you want to get\nhome to mama, being in the infantry is going to be the place where it\u2019s least likely to\nhappen?",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "Q: Oh yes.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you arrived in Europe \u2014 I want to establish this fact: you arrived in\nEurope when? In early *44?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: The wireless teletypers?",
        "Q: Well, what did you do? This is wa \u2014 something I don\u2019t understand: when you were\nin the infantry, what was it that you were doing over there in Europe?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t really see battle?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t see battle?",
        "Q: Well, what can you tell us \u2014 what can you tell us about this su \u2014 this secret mission?\nWhat was its goal, what was its purpose, what was \u2014",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "Q: And that we\u2019re \u2014 I\u2019m hoping, yeah, that we can now. So di \u2014 does this \u2014 the fact that\nyou were 1n this \u2014 in this particular \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the right word is occupation or\nactivity, is that what brought you closer to \u2014 when we\u2019re going to talk about Ohrdruf,\nthat \u2014 why you happened to be there at \u2014 at that time.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Where?",
        "Q: Were you in Germany?",
        "Q: Where did you vanish?",
        "Q: In all of this, you say you arrived in 1944, early in 1944, and probably it\u2019s a year and\nsome months later, maybe a year and three months later when you come onto Ohrdruf.\nIn that time, did you know, was it spoken of, was it known about, of what was\nhappening basically to the Jews and others in Europe? Was it \u2014 was \u2014 were you aware,\nwere others aware?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s an interesting question because as an individual, I don\u2019t remember being\nterribly well-informed about \u2014 well, once \u2014 once they opened Auschwitz, all right. But\nbefore that \u2014 well, I was aware of the Saint Louis incident.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: So tell us about \u2014 you say the first time you encountered this was in south\nGermany? So was that like Bavaria? In Bavaria is \u2014",
        "Q: Baden Wurttemberg\u2019\u201d",
        "Q: That\u2019s a little southwest, closer to France.",
        "Q: Oh no, no, then we\u2019re going the other direction, then it\u2019s Thtirringen. Then \u2014 was\nOhrdruf the first time you came into contact with what this policy had been?",
        "Q: Can you \u2014 now can we go into some detail about this? You were \u2014 when you were\nalready almost there, what was your \u2014 what was your job? What were you doing when\nyou were called to go to Ohrdruf? What was y \u2014 what were you involved in?",
        "Q: Right. Right.",
        "Q: Who was this person?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So, by the military equipment, do you mean U.S. military?",
        "Q: Okay. And how long, you know, from where your unit was to where this camp was,\nwas it a half hour drive, was it an hour drive, do you remember? Was it \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah. But anyway, it wasn\u2019t half a day. It wasn\u2019t something that was very far away.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "Q: Arbeit macht frei.",
        "Q: Arbeit macht frei.",

        "Q: So, did you open the \u2014 did you open a door to it?",
        "Q: What\u2019s the first picture you took?",
        "Q: And what did you see in it?",
        "Q: What did you see?",
        "Q: So when you came aco \u2014 across this first scene that you took a photograph of, there\nwas actual dumping of bodies going on in the \u2014",
        "Q: Was this now the U.S. military that was cleaning it out?",
        "Q: So, when you were in the barracks there were people who were alive, as well as\npeople who were dead.",
        "Q: Was this men or women?",
        "Q: Both men \u2014 any children?",
        "Q: When you say \u2014 excuse me that I\u2019m interrupting \u2014 when you say three stages, do\nyou mean that there were \u2014 the bunks were in three bunks \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and that people were on each level?",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",

        "Q: Did you take pictures of them?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Because it would be inside, and darker, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And do you have an idea of about how many bodies you saw, or how many\npeople you saw in there? Was it stuffed to the gills? Was it a hundred, 200? Was it 50?\nI know those are abstra \u2014 you know, sort of estimates, but \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 to get a sense of a \u2014",
        "Q: Did any move to you? Did anybody want to talk to you?",
        "Q: By trap, do you mean that 800 foot long \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 ditch that \u2014",
        "Q: It was the grave.",
        "Q: So this is before the lime starts taking effect?",
        "Q: This is before the lime starts doing what it does?",
        "Q: Can \u2014 do you have a sense of how long the U.S. military was already there before\nyou arrived?",
        "Q: A day?",
        "Q: In the evening, maybe.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: I\u2019m just going to say something here, okay? This is a continuation of the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Brooks McClure. We\u2019re on\na separate track, that\u2019s why we\u2019re go \u2014 so, I was asking you about the date. Do you\nhave an idea about when this was?",

        "Q: Did anybody try to speak with you from those \u2014 from \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you think you sa \u2014 maybe there were Soviet soldiers who were in the\ngroup, too?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: How long do you \u2014 did you stay there\u2019? How long did you stay wi \u2014 in this one\nplace?",

        "Q: I think you\u2019re doing great. I think you\u2019re doing just great. Before [interruption]\nokay, continue, yes, all right. It\u2019s going to be another track, or no?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: \u2014 the guards from the camp. Could you tell us something \u2014",
        "Q: So very quickly.",

        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "Q: The guards \u2014 excuse me that I\u2019m interrupting, but we go back to the guards. They\nwere brought back in civilian clothes to the camp. Did anybody recognize them and\nidentify them, from the \u2014 from those dying people?",
        "Q: Another question. Maybe my final one that has to do with Ohrdruf, unless Joe has\nsome more, 1s when peop \u2014 when the Americans came, the G.I.s \u2014 no, I have two more.\nWhen the Americans came, and they saw this, did they have any idea of what it was\nthat they were seeing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s my second question.",
        "Q: Does the name Franks say anything to you? Franks, as a last name.",

        "Q: Yeah, does the name Franks say anything to you?",

        "Q: So were you there a couple hours, perhaps, or half a day?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So it was more than one building?",
        "Q: Did you ever write about this after the war?",
        "Q: Did you ever write about this?",
        "Q: It is, but it is not \u2014 it\u2019s not direct witness, it is the impressions that you get after the\nfact.",

        "Answer: Well, I was born in\u2014 on March 8\", 1919 in New York City, and lived there\nfor the next 20 years of my life. I never went back, really. So I\u2014 my recollections of\ncourse, are of a nearly ra \u2014 a disruptive period. We were going through the Great\nDepression, and I thought for a while I was more or less exempt from the effects of this\nthing. But my father was an engineer and he got very sick early in his life, and died at\n53.",
        "A: This was 1940.",

        "A: I grew up in Manhattan.",
        "A: No, that was the thing you see. We were relatively well-off, and also terribly\nconservative economically. So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for\nanything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry. But,\nthere was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that\nsuddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were\ngoing to have to take over in some fashion, and this 1s \u2014 this would be very dis-\ndisorganizing, as it was. And so \u2014",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He worked for the New York state transportation department, and his own job had\nto do with train wrecks. When \u2014 when there was an accident, they had a team that went\nout and tried to find out why it happened. And he was very good at that business, I\nguess, because he went right through from \u2014 he was a very young man, almost an office\nboy when he arrived, and worked his way up. And the thing is, he had no education\neither. He \u2014 he was born in Ohio, and he went to the good schools. I guess you would\nsay he was a very ambitious man, and he read all the time, and that was a great\nJuly 7, 2011\ninfluence for me. He had me reading Dickens and Dumas when I was nine and 10\nyears old, but \u2014",
        "A: Well, if you starting at the right end \u2014",

And well, at any rate, I \u2014 I got a piece of\neducation from reading, and I \u2014 the reading habit I got into, and had occasional troubles\nwith my schoolteachers because they didn\u2019t think that the family should race ahead of\nthis program, you know.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old man, and \u2014 but he \u2014 he got very, very sick.\nHeart can \u2014 heart condition, and we knew he wasn\u2019t going to be around a long time, so\nwe had to prepare for this. And the preparation did not include any possibility of going\nto college.",
        "A: Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with\na high school education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn\u2019t have much of\na chance. So \u2014 but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which\nactually I developed in the grammar school. And before I got out of grammar school, I\nhad an idea, I \u2014 I had a\u2014I wa \u2014 a little play friend, the \u2014 these correspondences with\nchildren from other places.",
        "A: Yeah, one of \u2014 one of my teachers went to, of all places, western Australia, which\nis just \u2014 just about west of anything in the wor \u2014 in the world. And so I-I got the \u2014 my\nfriend sent me the local paper \u2014 matter of fact, all of the local papers. And I noticed that\none was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others.\nThere was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page\none and that sort of thing. This was different, this had headlines on page one\n[indecipherable] news on page one. And I was really intrigued by this. And I had\nalready started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism. I\nJuly 7, 2011\ndon\u2019t know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that. And \u2014 and then\none day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old Australia, would like\nto have a correspondent in the United States.",
        "A: And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in \u2014 in Asia who traveled\naround. And then they had another correspondent in London, which was home to the\nAustralians. And so these were very special needs. One was, of course, the local aspect,\nof the \u2014 of news, and the other was London. And \u2014 but I said th \u2014 I-I decided to write a\nletter to the editor. So I went to the British \u2014 the \u2014 I don\u2019t read it any more, but oh, I\ncan\u2019t remember the name of it. At any rate, it\u2019s \u2014 was \u2014 it\u2019s a\u20141t\u2019s a British\npublication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for \u2014 that we\nhave.",
        "A: No, no, the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no, no, no, this 1\u2014 no, no. No, it says \u2014\nA2: You mean like the encyclopedia.",
        "A: Sure, it\u2019s got the name of a \u2014 of a the \u2014 research publication, but \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: But at any rate, it was the one place where they had all of the editors by name,\neverywhere in the British commonwealth. And so I thought, well, in the British\ncommonwealth, they speak English, and that\u2019s the only thing I can speak, so I wrote\nthem a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism. No mention of grade, age,\nanything like that. So, I had the \u2014 and I followed my father\u2019s rules. He said, when you\nwrite a letter, you keep it on one page, if you possibly can, because you lose the reader\non the second page.",
        "A: And so \u2014 so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don\u2019t be\nfooled by the multi-syllable words. So I just said in plain English that I was a\u2014a\njournalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their\npaper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other places, and none in the\nUnited States. So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a\ncorrespondent. And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know. I\nconsulted no one, and I got \u2014 I had the shivers afterwards. Then, in the normal turn of\nevents, which between the United States and \u2014 and Australia is about two months, I\ngot a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are \u2014 we are\ninterested in you. We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let\u2019s\nconsider it a possibility. And so I did, I\u2014 I found the name of the editor of the\npublication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very\nJuly 7, 2011\nlong article about the failure of the \u2014 0-0-of Roosevelt\u2019s policies. Because at that time,\nit were \u2014 that was about 1937 was it, something like that.",
        "A: Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old. I\u2014 I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had \u2014\nhad absolutely nothing, so \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: Oh, a lot \u2014 a lot of \u2014 a lot of gall.",

        "A: And \u2014\nA2: The chancellor.",
        "A: Yeah. And so I a\u2014I was a con \u2014 conscious of the growth of Hitler. Actually, almost\neverybody was, but I read so much. I read internationally because I was interested in\nJuly 7, 2011\ninternational affairs, but I was also \u2014 I-I was taught at home that you \u2014 you\u2019re a man\nwhen you gu \u2014 when you\u2019re born, and you use your brain from there on. And so it was\na very good policy. And I had a mixed literary education, in that I \u2014 there was \u201cTarzan\nof the Apes,\u201d which I also read, and the bi \u2014 the \u2014 was it the Hunter boys?",
        "A: A-Another series. And so here I was reading the classical 20\" century \u2014 or 19\"\ncentury literature from Europe, in English, of course, translated, and then these other\nbooks, and enjoying them both. But at any rate, no, I was really up on the news in\nEurope. There were a lot of other things too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble\nthere. France was having a terrible time. This was followed up by the other activities\nthat are \u2014 were very ominous in Japan. They were going after Manchukuo \u2014 ma \u2014\nManchuria. And \u2014 and in Africa the Italians were trying to take over \u2014",
        "A: Ethiopia. So, it was a very disturbing time, interesting time. I can\u2019t say that I was\nscared by it. I was intrigued by it, and there was some very good books at the time\ncoming out, various commentators; professional journalists wrote books.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well I \u2014 he was a giant in the \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 in the group. But at any rate, there was a great deal of concentration on the things\nthat counted abroad, and also many of the problems at home. We had no military\npolicy, and we were \u2014 we were terribly weak at the time, and that was one of the big\nissues coming up in the United States, how do we protect it?",
        "A: Oh yes, well, we \u2014 we, of course, had dinner every night in the dining room, and it\nwas a conversat-sational sort of sport. So we talked about everything, and sometimes\nwhen I wasn\u2019t old enough to know, I got instructed from the higher people, my mother\nand father. And yeah, you know, it was a \u2014 it was a very good way to get educated, I\nthink, without feeling the pain.",
        "A: There were a lot of people then, commentators on radio. There was one fellow \u2014\nwhat was his name?\nA2: Kaltenborn.",
        "A: Yeah, Kaltenborn.\nJuly 7, 2011\nA2: H\u2014H.V. Kaltenborn.",
        "A: Yeah. He was a \u2014 and there was also a man who spoke so fast, we couldn\u2019t eat. So\nwe turned him off. And Lowell Thomas, and you know, a lot of people.",
        "A: The pretty \u2014 pretty much accomplished journalists. And the \u2014 and who could\nexpound on a-anything. I think they had a little more freedom than they do today,\nbecause there are other people who popped up and said, you\u2019re wrong. And so that was\na very good example of growing up in a democratic state.",
        "A: It was a\u2014 it was a fine experience, and a lot of fun.",
        "A: Well, I did, actually I did, but that \u2014 long before that, they had that article, which\nwas very long. It took a whole bedsheet of paper, that they used to print on those days,\nand oh, they had the [indecipherable] that they \u2014 usually you find in the \u2014 in the\nEnglish press, but in the American. Our correspondent in New York \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 tell us what in the world is going on there? So \u2014 so I was astonished, because they\nwere sort of ta \u2014 presuming. They didn\u2019t know how old I was. I know they wanted to\nfind the \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: They weren\u2019t \u2014 well, they wanted to find out, but events were moving too fast.",
        "A: And I was, of course, absolutely stunned, because I had a plan. As soon as I got that\nrejection, I would write to an English paper in South Africa, and see if I could work on\nthem. And there was no \u2014 there was no compensation for this, but every few weeks I\u2019d\nget a very generous check, a hundred dollars, which to me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was a lot of money, to cover my expenses. Well, my expenses were because I\ntraveled by subway, and you know, were \u2014 were very slim. And \u2014 but I\u2014I hada\nterrible time because I found that between reading about these things and getting an\nidea of how coverage is done, and then having your pencil in your hand and trying to\ndecide, do I do it, or d-d \u2014 or don\u2019t I? I had a couple of disastrous \u2014 potentially\ndisastrous experiences. One was Lena Medina. Lena Medina was a five year old girl\nin Lima, Peru who gave birth to a child \u2014 at least the story, this is what the story said.\nAnd my source was I had read it, it was a UP dispatch. And I knew because I\u2019d gotten\nthe \u2014 a sort of the copy boy\u2019s job at the \u201cHerald Tribune\u2019 at the \u2014 at that time. I knew\nthat the paper always substituted the UP for AP or anybody else in Latin America,\nbecause they felt that it was more reliable. So in comes this strange story, and I was too\nyoung to have the educational experience of anything involving women. Women were\nJuly 7, 2011\nthere, and what it takes \u2014 what I assume it \u2014 you know, it assumes that. But at any rate",
        "A: \u2014 this was all to \u2014 very unusual, I thought it was \u2014 I thought instinctively it was\nimpossible, because I had never met anyone five years old who had a child.\nA2: Reasonable conclusion.",
        "A: And so I sent in my cable as one of the little stories I had from America, this strange\nplace where five year olds have children. And then apparently \u2014",
        "A: They \u2014 they printed it, oh what they did though, they did a very clever thing.",
        "A: They also doubted the veracity of this.",
        "A: So they called every [indecipherable] person in Perth, and asked them what they\nthought of it, and they said, it\u2019s crazy. It can\u2019t be, it\u2019s impossible. So then they \u2014 they\nran that story together with my story, in order to take the onus off themselves, in case I\n\u2014I\u2019d gone crazy. And \u2014 but they had, and they didn\u2019t know it. And so then there was\nthat dead \u2014 dreadfully dead period, nobody wrote me or anything saying you shouldn\u2019t\ntake these stories seriously. And I had my explanation all done, because I realized, I\ntalked to some older people, th-they said, oh, that\u2019s ridiculous. So then \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 \u201cLife\u201d magazine was bought by somebody on the paper. And this was a \u2014 oh,\nmonth or two later, and all \u2014 everything goes very slowly out there. So \u2014 and it showed\na picture of Lina Medina, her surgeon who had per \u2014 performed the operation. It was a\n\u2014 it was a\u2014 a Caesarian operation. And \u2014 and there was the little infant, believe it or\nnot, there he was. And \u2014 and they got very excited about this, so immediately they\njumped on it. They \u2014 they reported the existence of the photograph, and said they\u2019d \u2014 or\nthey \u2014 they thought that they should print the fact that this was photographed, maybe\neverybody would be interested in reading it, or seeing it. And they \u2014 they got really\nvery excited. The publisher began going back to the Monday lunches that he had sort of\nartfully dodged, after that terrible thing. And the \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, I had the writing, yo-you know, I\u2019d been submitting stuff, and\nthey\u2019d been printing it, and I got pretty sassy about it. I expected to see the story\nrepeated, whatever I said, with a byline on it. They put a byline every story, even a\nshort one. And no complaint, no instructions, nothing from them. They just let me go. I\nhad \u2014 and then in 1941, I still had this job, and I had the \u2014 another one of those shocks.\nI was \u2014 I \u2014I had a very weak \u2014 weak week. Poor week for journalism. Nothing was\ndeveloping that I thought I could afford to send. It was 35 cents a na \u2014 a \u2014 a word, press\nif I filed. So I was very conscious of this, par-particularly because of my Scottish ba \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011\nbackground, and I didn\u2019t want to waste the paper\u2019s money. So I came to this crisis\nwhere that weekly cable looked pretty feeble. Excuse me. And there was a big, big\nevent the Wednesday before. This was about Friday, I was filing. And there was a\nbattle at Aron between the French and the British. Maybe you remember it. I don\u2019t\nknow how they [indecipherable] but this was a pretty exciting story because the\nBritish and French were allies, and they \u2014 the French had been trying to get Admiral\nDarlan, who was in command of the French forces, to \u2014 to surrender, and the \u2014 the\nFrench were very stubborn; they wouldn\u2019t surrender. So finally the British said, all\nright, if you don\u2019t surrender, we\u2019re going to fight you. And they started this battle, a\nreally horrible thing because the casualty rate was enormous. Some of the biggest ships\nthen operating in the two navies, had been sunk, there in Algeria, of all places.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Yeah, that was it. And so I knew all about this, of course, and then source reports in\nthe general news that so many ships had been lost, and so many people had been killed.\nIt was a pretty horrible outcome. But I thought [indecipherable] and maybe \u2014 maybe I\ncould sneak it in, and they\u2019d realize that I was using old news, but I had to. And so,\noddly enough, they printed it. But what they did is they ran \u2014 they went to the archives\nand got the Jane\u2019s book \u2014 Jane\u2019s ships, and copied out the pictures that were\nJuly 7, 2011\nmentioned, all of the casualties, and read it down one side of page one. And then they\nsent all of \u2014 the few little words I had to say, I never mentioned anything that I \u2014 you\nknow [indecipherable] to repeat. But obviously the battle had been fought, and I had to\nsay something about it. So I did that, and that was all printed in eight point type. So\nmust have been a very impressive thing. I never saw it.",
        "A: No, the paper never came. My \u2014 every once in a while I\u2019d miss a copy. So, any rate I\n\u2014I was agonized when I discovered that they printed it, and no other paper in Australia\nprinted it, of course. And so th-there was no wi \u2014 no battle and all of its casualties from\nBrooks McClure. So I wondered how \u2014 how we got around this, and what happened.\nWell, what happened was that I \u2014 I always made s-small reports, as small as I could\nmake them, and put each story on a different page. And then I\u2019d sit in the telegrapher\u2019s\noffice and peel them off wa \u2014 one by one. Well, because this was such a bad reporting\nday, I worked very hard and very late, to get the best I could out of it, and so I guess the\ncable came in with this odd story in the middle, and the rest of it much less important\nstuff. And so the Australian censor then record it. What they done is they blanked it\nout. And so, on the next Wednesday was an announcement that Churchill is going to\nmake a special speech. And so everybody in the world was listening to that, and they\nheard all about the Battle of Aron, many of them for the first time. So, at any rate, I\nescaped \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: \u2014 that time, and I didn\u2019t even know it. And I thought I was so smart, oh boy.\n[indecipherable] to get it. They said they didn\u2019t know what to do, they held a \u2014 and\neditorial conference, and \u2014 and they were all standing around, they \u2014 all the editors, and\ndebating this thing. Finally somebody said well, look, he\u2019s our man, and we\u2019re \u2014 we \u2014\nwe trust him, and it\u2019s all down on paper. I think we should stick with it, see what\nhappens. And so everybody more or less agreed, that\u2019s what they did. And they saved\nthemselves a lot of trouble. Well, all right, I\u2019m sorry. I hope I didn\u2019t digress \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 too much.",
        "A: Oh yes.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Oh well, I was \u2014 I was not drafted yet, and I guess I had a slightly preferential rating,\nbecause I had al \u2014 besides my father, who was very sick, I had three women to take care\nof in the immediate family.",

But wa \u2014 events moved very fast. He was a\nstubborn old Scot and he \u2014 he went to work every day. He didn\u2019t know he was dying\nand his physician was recommending that he quit, and all that. No, he wanted to go on,\ndo the job. So it was a terrible strain on everybody who loved him, of course. And I \u2014\nwhat changed \u2014 well, one thing that didn\u2019t change was the journalism idea. I had now\nfixed it, because I did this silly thing. And I knew that that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\nRegardless, I \u2014 I went hunting all over New York, all over Westchester County to try\nto get a job. And of course, they almost laughed. What school did I go to? And I only\n[indecipherable] curious creature. I was six-one, 180 pounds, and in other words,\nalways out of line with my peers, and \u2014 and always doing silly things. So \u2014 so I\u2014I got\nthe desserts I \u2014 I really worked for, and couldn\u2019t get a job in \u2014 on a newspaper. So, we\nhad \u2014 we had to manage \u2014 course, we had to live on the re \u2014 the savings of the family,\nand it was very hard. I \u2014 I was out run \u2014 running around, trying to get another job and\nall this, and it was \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Laurel Hill.",
        "A: Do you know Laurel Hill?",
        "A: Well, Manhattan is ver \u2014 is long and lean. And when you get up to the top, there\u2019s\na little \u2014 little piece at the very top, it\u2019s a mountain, and it\u2019s called Laurel Hill.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure, it\u2019s a na \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s the next thing to the bran \u2014 Bronx. And, in fact, in grammar school, I went to\nschool in \u2014 in the Bronx, and in \u2014 and afterwards, in high school, I went to George\nWashington High, which is down at Washington Heights. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, I got a job, oddly, on the \u2014 on the \u201cHerald Tribune.\u201d I had been writing a\nlittle bit, trying to sell some articles in America, too. And I didn\u2019t do spectacularly, but\nI made a few sales. And then there was a man named Charlie McLenden(ph), who had\njust taken over as city editor of the \u201cHerald Tribune,\u201d and I got an interview with him.\nJuly 7, 2011\nAnd I brought my clippings, to show him that I was doing something. And he said well,\nI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have any jobs for \u2014 for people like you, you know, education, all\nthose considerations, on \u2014 on the staff. But he said, I \u2014 Pll hire you for \u2014 on the \u2014 for \u2014\nas a copyboy. That was another irrelevancy, here I was over six feet tall, and running\ncopy from one desk to another. Sort of an embarrassing situation. And so I had that job\nfor a long time, they didn\u2019t fire me, they kept me on. And they had a reputation for\nthose that they \u2014 that passed the test and stayed, of \u2014 of making them reporters after a\ncertain length of time. But all these people had, you know, education. So it didn\u2019t look\nvery promising. But I was able to use the paper\u2019s facilities, their library, the \u2014 they had\nan internal telegraph office, where I spent a lot of time writing up my stuff. And the\nwork wasn\u2019t hard. The \u2014 this big goof was running around doing it. And so, at any rate,\nI used it to good advantage, and almost gave up. I \u2014 I was \u2014 I was then 23.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Well, that\u2019s when I joined the army, and I \u2014 my mother and I had\na ken \u2014 consultation. I asked her what she would think if I went in the army. She said\nshe thought it was a very intelligent thing to do. After all, there are all kinds of people,\nbig sons like you that have to go. Sure they have to die, they have to suffer, but they\u2019re\ngoing. And she said that, you\u2019re an American, you have to decide what to do. So I\njoined the infantry, which was the most idiotic thing to do. I\u2019m sure I could have gotten\na job at a \u2014 at a better branch of the service, but \u2014 but I fel \u2014 felt very patriotic at the\nJuly 7, 2011\ntime, I did the right thing. So \u2014 and then, of course, I had to make a lot of changes, I\nhad to quit my job in aus \u2014 Australia. Which actually was paying off a little bit, you\nknow, they were paying me far more than I was worth, and I had originally asked just\nto \u2014 to work for nothing, but they wouldn\u2019t accept that. So, they were very nice. And so\nthen off I went into the infantry.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: United States? Oh yeah, sure. I\u2019d, of course, did all the basic training and all, which\nis a\u2014 which is another great exercise. It\u2019s very, very hard, you know, you \u2014 you have to\nfall on your rifle, and do all sorts of odd things that normal human beings probably\nwouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: But \u2014 but I got along all right, I got promotions. And then I had a \u2014 a specialty, I \u2014 I\ndeveloped a special skill [indecipherable] because I worked at night, and sometimes I\nstayed over, and then the fellow down \u2014 we had a wire link between New York and\nWashington, and there was another young fellow there, just in my same position. And\nwe would send long messages to each other. And I \u2014I got so that I could type 60 words\na minute.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: And then \u2014 that\u2019s the speed of the transmitter distributor that does it automatically,\nyou know. And so, when I got in the army, I did another foolish thing. They said, put\ndown anything you think y-you might be able to do in the service, if you have a special",
        "A: \u2014 skill. So I thought about that a little bit. I thought the only thing I knew how to do\nwas to type. So \u2014 so I told him that I could \u2014 I \u2014 I could imitate the speed of a \u2014 an\nelectric transmitter on the typewriter. Well that\u2019s \u2014 really that wasn\u2019t such a \u2014 an\nachievement. There are millions of girls with typewriters who could do that.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s right. And they didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do this. So somebody had run\nthe IBM rod you know, through the bo \u2014 through the cards, and came out with this\nremarkable fact that one of their soldiers \u2014 actually, I had \u2014 I had this experience with\ncomputer \u2014 with transmitters that, you know \u2014 computer transmission.\nA2: The teletypes.",

        "A: Yeah, teletypes, yeah.",
        "A: So, well, then I didn\u2019t know this, but the \u2014 the army decided in the earlier period,\nwhen they weren\u2019t so overwhelmed, that they would experiment with a \u2014 a wireless.\nWell, wireless was an unknown then, for teletypes, although it\u2019s \u2014 today it\u2019s e-\neverywhere. And so they \u2014 they transferred me. I think I was a \u2014I was probably just a\nPFC at the time. And \u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Private first class. And all of a sudden I found that I was still in the infantry, but I\nhad this special assignment. They had teletype machines, and you could practice on\nthem, and I practiced on them, and somebody else did too. And one of \u2014 two of \u2014 two\nother men were taken in for this, but they were both noncoms. One was a master\nsergeant and the other ta \u2014 the next le-level. And so \u2014 but they came out of the \u2014 out of\nthe signals business, they worked for railroads, you know, all sorts of things. So they\nhad plenty of experience. They knew all about how \u2014 how these things worked. I didn\u2019t\nknow, I couldn\u2019t repair one. I wa \u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to tell them I wasn\u2019t qualified. I was\nsecretly pleased that the \u2014 well, I guess I already had a grade. I was probably a corporal\nor a sergeant by that time. And I\u2019Il tell you, when you think and what you do in the\nJuly 7, 2011\ninfantry, how you will get home to mama is a question. So \u2014 so I the \u2014 I\u2014I decided I'd\ndo what the wa \u2014 army wanted me to do. And so I had this curious job all through \u2014\nactually variations in my career, I joined the air force, and I \u2014 I \u2014 I qualified, and I was\nvery keen about that.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No, this was during the height of the casualties in \u2014 in the eighth army, you know, in\nthe \u2014 in \u20141n Europe. And of course, we weren\u2019t doing too well the \u2014 Asia either, but \u2014\nbut it was a \u2014 it was a death wish, actually, if you got into that. And I \u2014 I was willing to\ngo, but when I had any kind of alternative, I \u2014 I was willing to accept it. Then a \u2014",

        "A: Although the \u2014 although I discovered after I got in the air force, that the casualty rate\nwas just as great. They shoot you out of the sky, and \u2014 instead. So the question \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014\nI wasn\u2019t doing too good at artful dodging, really. But at any rate, things were all right. I\nwas just getting around, and then finally wind \u2014 wound up back in the infantry when\nEisenhower declared that they had too many fliers, and \u2014 and that they were going to\npair \u2014 send all the fliers and [indecipherable] specialists, and all the special kinds of\npeople back to the infantry.

        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see. Oh, this was late \u201943 or early \u00b044.",
        "A: And I \u2014 and I joined this infantry unit, one of the last to go to Europe, actually, and\noddly enough, you know, was a late arrival, I was put into Patton\u2019s Third Army,\nwhich had one of the dreadful infantry scores \u2014 casualty scores.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Let me see. Must have been.",
        "A: And we were the last division to arrive, so we were sort of a \u2014 a poor gift to the\narmy that got it. But we trained very hard, and I had had a little training before, so I\nfelt, they can train me to death if they want to, because I want to be equal to the job\nwhen I get it. So \u2014 but in the meantime there was this typewriter business. Now, if you\ncan imagine, they had, while we were in the States, they had the typewriter equipment,\nand they had this special articulated truck, one of those things that swings in all\ndirections, you know, to \u2014 to transport it. And I was tra \u2014 I was trained in how to park\nthis thing, and you know, to run it, in case they needed me. But \u2014 but they had a regular\nteam of transport people who \u2014 who normally handled this job. Well, I went into the\nfield in Mississippi, and did all these things, and that\u2019s the last I saw of the truck or the\n\u2014 or the computers, the \u2014",
        "A: The tele \u2014 wireless teletype. And they didn\u2019t \u2014 course they don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t consult me\nin the service on anything, really, but I didn\u2019t know what ha \u2014 what happened to it, but\nthey had forgotten to cancel it or change it in some way. So there was always this little\nstrange thing, that I went abroad, I was \u2014 I was posted in the signal company of the 65\"\nJuly 7, 2011\ninfantry division, and got assignments occasionally, but it was not a \u2014 not terribly a\nbusy job for me. A division is about 14,000 men, so you can see they had a lot \u2014 lot of\npeople that do their normal work. And \u2014 and I never was pressed too much, because I\nhad this secret job. Nobody ever talked about it, 1t was just \u2014 I was just out in the cold, I\nguess. I got a couple of promotions.",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 I was attached to this super-secret mission. So, I don\u2019t know, that was\nenough for me. But I was in \u2014 getting in a few \u2014 few firefights, but nothing \u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, sure I f-fought. I was shot and \u2014 shot at and I shot back, and no, I had enough\nexperience so I could say I was an infantryman, but \u2014 but there I was encased 1n this\nsituation, and they \u2014",
        "A: Well, the thing was, they wanted to develop a wireless system, which would connect\nthe \u2014 the frontline troops with headquarters, and \u2014 in-instantly. And you can do it with\nJuly 7, 2011\nteletype, but you can\u2019t do it if you have to have lines between teletypes being cut by the\nenemy all the time.",
        "A: And just laying the lines is too hideous a job. But this was obviously the beginning\nof a project that we were trying to analyze all the aspects, and see if they can straighten\nit out. I\u2014 I could understand, but I never \u2014 never thought it was terribly funny, but I\nhappen to be the beneficiary, so I wasn\u2019t going to argue about it. Well, as a result\nthough, I had a distorted military career, in which \u2014 during which I had the two\nexperiences that we \u2014 we were to talk about.",

There were other people in the army, some fascinating people.\nThere \u2014 you can\u2019t imagine how some noncommissioned officers got positions of\nenormous authority, and it\u2019s because of that, in this instance, that I got into one of these\nthings.

        "A: And the criticism of Roosevelt because he didn\u2019t save those people, keep them from\ngoing back and dying, like they did.",
        "A: And so I \u2014 I was aware of that, and of course I knew that the German propaganda\nwas all anti-Jewish. But this business of gathering up people just to kill them, I didn\u2019t \u2014\nwasn\u2019t aware of being aware of that. And in fact, when I \u2014 when \u2014 when we discovered\nthat the work quarters of these poor people in south Germany, first time we had\nencountered it \u2014 apparently, I don\u2019t know how they got away without being caught,\nbecau \u2014 of course, Germany is a very big country.",

        "A: A young man from Chicago, ju \u2014 was just a name to me. I got to know him, but he\nwa \u2014 he worked on the \u201cChicago Tribune,\u201d and had \u2014 that was a fascinating \u2014\nsomething that I didn\u2019t know. Because, I guess he had good talent, he was taught to do\nall the main jobs on the paper. So that the \u2014 if the \u2014 if the printers went out on strike, he\nJuly 7, 2011\nwould go down and work a linotype machine. So, at any rate, he was a \u2014 a pretty \u2014\npretty savvy young guy, and had been kicked around a little bit, so he \u2014 he knew how to\n\u2014 how to handle problems. And \u2014 and he had a boss, a \u2014 I don\u2019t know, a colonel, or a\nlieutenant colonel who was very enamored of him for a while; this is a smart boy. And\nso he gradually elevated in authority. He was given [indecipherable] of things to do, th\n\u2014 his boss wanted results, and he was a results getter. And so, at any rate, by the time I\nga \u2014I got to know him pretty well, because of my interest in journalism, I found he had\nbeen with the \u201cChicago Tribune,\u201d which was not the New York Tribune \u2014 \u201cHerald\nTribune.\u201d",
        "A: But \u2014 but we had a similar interest, and we joked about \u2014 about journalism, and so\non. And so it got so, for little things. I was mostly idle, in another part of the camp. The\n\u2014 the camp is a city, really. And he\u2019d call on me if he ever had something that \u2014 a job to\ndo, that he couldn\u2019t do or \u2014 so \u2014 so we got pretty chummy. Then one day a-\u2014 one day a\nJeep showed up first thing in the morning. I \u2014 I was just finishing breakfast, I guess,\nand I was being called by my friend. So I got in the Jeep, and off we went, over to his\nheadquarters, and he told me we \u2014 we\u2019 ve discovered some anomaly here, strange thing,\na lot of people dying and I don\u2019t know, we just got a radio report on this thing at \u2014 I\nneed this \u2014 h-he \u2014 he described it. Well, he said he \u2014 he wanted to send me over there to\ntake a picture of this thing. He said we should have pictures of it. So he gave me a no \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011\na German 35 millimeter camera, one of the best that they make. And \u2014 but it had film in\nit, I didn\u2019t know the speed of the film, and that was a big handicap because I knew I\ncouldn\u2019t take many pictures in the shadow, if \u2014 if \u2014 1f that was standard film. So, off I\nwent, and they had a driver, really quite incredible. He had surveyed the route to this\nplace by \u2014 by using a \u2014 automobile company maps. And so we went right there, 1t was\nno problem, he made no mistakes, he drove right there. And we got into the area, we\ndidn\u2019t know where the camp was, but we saw all of the military equipment that had\nbeen gathering.",
        "A: Yes.",

And then we were \u2014 were led by\nthe locals, wha-whatever G.I.s we could find, and led to this place. Well, it was very\nremote in the woods, and the little building, all of raw wood. And they had a huge gate,\nwith a slogan, let\u2019s see if I can remember. It\u2019s a very simple slogan in German, and\n[indecipherable] although most people had to deal with it.

And I learned also later that they built hundreds of these\non the same plans, so that if you encountered one in one place, it looked like the same\nyou saw before. And \u2014",
        "A: No, no, it didn\u2019t have any distinction or appearance of authority or anything like\nthat.

        "A: First picture I took was of the \u2014 of the grave. There was about, oh, I would say about\n800 feet long, very long, and very deep, and about 15 feet wide.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Well, bodies. In fact, I\u2014 I had no trouble understanding what it was for, because\nthey were in the process of dumping more bodies in, all of them naked. They take \u2014\nthey took off the rags that they had been wearing, washed them, and then they\u2019d use\nthem again, you see. But th \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Yes, oh yeah, sure.",
        "A: Oh, there were. There was a lot of work to do, because there were many bodies in\nthis \u2014 in the barracks. Barracks were three \u2014 three stages high, as I remember, and they\nwere just lay \u2014 laid out on the floor of th \u2014 each level. And some of them were so weak,\nthey couldn\u2019t get up to eat.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, they were dying. That\u2019s what they were doing, it was \u2014",
        "A: All \u2014 all \u2014 all \u2014 both.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t notice any children. I think they disposed of the children very quickly. I\nknow \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah. Now, of course, the stronger ones so happened to be on the top, because they\ncould still get down, but \u2014 but there were a lot of them even in the \u2014 on the lowest level,\nwho were just comatose. Ju-Just a terr \u2014 it\u2019s a terrible sight. These are people who\nshould be dead, but were alive.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t, because I wasn\u2019t sure of the \u2014 of the film.",
        "A: Yeah. I figured it was not a ver \u2014 a super speed, that\u2019s what you need for that, in\norder \u2014",
        "A: Your light, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s almost no light in there. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 I took some\npictures, but they didn\u2019t come out.",
        "A: Yeah, hard to tell.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Hard to tell how many there were. I went in, I took a look, I saw some of them, and I\ncame out.",
        "A: Oh yes, well, not \u2014 not \u2014 I mean, they didn\u2019t campaign, but you could see they\u2019d\nlook at you with those empty eyes, and beg you, really, to help. But th \u2014 they were very\npleased, they were \u2014 by \u2014 by the time I got there, the operational troops had called for\nhelp, and they got some \u2014 some very skilled medical people, by the way. They couldn\u2019t\ndo much for the ones that were dying, of course, but they were dying, and they had to\nbe disposed of, because it was a very great danger, biological danger. So, when I got\nthere, I \u2014 the one thing I remember, the one, looked like pretty husky guy, a man,\nmaybe in his middle 30s, something like that, carrying a skeleton.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a\u2014 and somebody, they put in lime. And I saw this, and I think that was\nearly enough so that \u2014 it isn\u2019t the way it necessarily looked at the end. But \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right, 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 th-there \u2014 there was some lime underneath.

I suspect that 1t was there be \u2014 before the guards left. They \u2014 they got a\nwarning that the Americans were coming.",
        "A: Well, not to my \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too long.",
        "A: A\u2014no, no, not a day. They \u2014 the tank came on it \u2014 what was that hour, I don\u2019t\nknow. It could \u2014 I think it was a man who became General Abrams, who was the\ncommander of the tank. He was then a captain, or something. And then he had other\ntrucks, cars with him, with troops. Let\u2019s see. I think it was fairly late in the day when he\ncame on, or possibly even later.",
        "A: Yeah, right. And he immediately re \u2014 radioed back to headquarters, and \u2014 and they\nof course notified the division command. And that\u2019s the way I got the word myself,\nJuly 7, 2011\nvery first thing in the morning. We \u2014 so they must have been there, couldn\u2019t have been\ndoing very much, because of the darkness.",
        "A: And I suppose they were \u2014 they must have been suspicious too. A lot of serious\ntrouble going on one place, you know, and th \u2014 and after dark, you don\u2019t dare endanger\nyourself. But at any rate they \u2014 they notified us.

        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t keep track of dates. I\u2014 I could be a week off \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at any time.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: I th\u2014I seem to remember that it was April. I was looking \u2014 incidentally, I didn\u2019t\nmention this, but I had a few notes, and I had some of the pictures that I took, in my\nfiles. And my wife died, and I got sick, and so I didn\u2019t follow up very much on this.\nHad to sell the house and \u2014 and move into an old people\u2019s home. So, I \u2014 I \u2014I wasn\u2019t\naware of this very much, but unfortunately a lot of the files that I preev \u2014 prized, were\nlost. And so I would have had the date, and a \u2014 a lot \u2014 lot of other things in there. I \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t imagine my not noting that down, because this was such an unusual experience.",
        "A: But \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh, it was always dank.",
        "A: Sort of chilly, you know. I do \u2014 there was certainly in the air, and it was in \u2014 I\nsuppose even in \u2014 it might have been in spring, you know, the weather.",
        "A: But I was wearing a re-regular uniform, no coat or anything. So I\u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\ncouldn\u2019t have been very cold. But those poor people, oh my heavens.",
        "A: Yes. Usually in a language I didn\u2019t understand. A lot of them were Poles, ge \u2014\nGermans, Russians.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s quite possible. The Germans were not very respectful of the \u2014 of the\nRussians \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 soldiers. So, anyway, that\u2019s really the extent of my experience.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Not \u2014 not very long.",
        "A: We were \u2014 we were on the move. The \u2014 the \u2014 the army as itself, was moving very\nfast. And that\u2019s why I think they \u2014 they overtook some people that were trying to get\naway. And Patton moved at times, 50 miles in a day. Now, if you can imagine a\nmilitary force of maybe clo-close to a half a million men \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 moving this fast, and actually, if you read up on it, it\u2019s quite interesting in\nretrospect, to see how well the Americans did. They fought like fiends. The Germans\nde-defending their own country, didn\u2019t do nearly as well.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: No, thank you \u2014",

        "A: It would be a shame not to talk about that. The \u2014 the camp had th \u2014 been warned by\nwireless, and immediately started to disband. And ul \u2014 a lot of the \u2014 the guards seemed\nto have rooms or something down in the town of Ohrdruf, o-h-r-d-r-u-f, as |\nremember the spelling. And some of them dashed down and changed their clothes, and\njust mingled with the local people. And s \u2014 but very soon the Americans realized what\nhad happened, and they sent a tank down and they put them on the tank, brought them\nback \u2014 the ones they could find. They fu \u2014 found quite a number apparently. This all\nhappened before I arrived.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, yeah, so was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no delay. I thought the military did a wonderful job. They didn\u2019t pause for a\nminute. And they brought them back dressed in their [indecipherable] uniforms, and \u2014\nand civilian clothes. And this town, by the way, is a lovely little paradise, beautifully\nkept. They all had flower \u2014 window flower arrangements. And \u2014 and it was really a\nwonderful place to go to. They had the [indecipherable] and then the \u2014 all the\narrangements. And so \u2014 and they had a full population town, I guess, mostly middle\naged people, women and men. But \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011",

        "A: Oh, I walked it, sure.",

        "A: But, at any rate, I got down there, and I remember entering the town from one end,\nand seeing how beautiful it was, and how fiendish the whole idea seemed to be. At a-\nany rate \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, well, that\u2019s what I was about to say. There were some of the Holocaust\nvictims who were at least strong enough to stand up and move around. And when the \u2014\nwhen the Americans brought these people in, I heard, and I \u2014 and thi-this is not my\nJuly 7, 2011\npersonal experience, but they attacked them. And at first the Americans had to\nintervene, and stop it and so forth. And \u2014 but that didn\u2019t appease the \u2014 the victims at all,\nof course. The \u2014 but all of this is hearsay.

        "A: No. No. Of course, the first thing you see is the dead and dying.",
        "A: And these were obviously not people armed, so they weren\u2019t soldiers in the normal\nsense. And they were all dressed in these curious uniforms, with the stripes going\ndown, you know. And so they \u2014 they were \u2014 must have been aware that these were\nprisoners who had revolted, or something. I-It was hard to piece together a story, even\nwhen I was there.

        "A: So no, the next day they got Patton, Bradley, I think \u2014 what\u2019s that? Field Marshall\nMontgomery, and then a couple of others, because they found that 1t was something\nvery unusual. Actually, how it escaped their notice so long, I don\u2019t know, because our\npatrols extended far in. But I suppose er \u2014 if 1t had been er \u2014 discovered ear-earlier, it\nwould have been a little bit \u2014 bit of a situation. For one thing, maybe the response,\nbecause of the time of day, would have been quicker. They \u2014 they rea \u2014 they \u2014 they\nrecognized \u2014 the medics that they had were just regular combat medics, and they knew\nthey couldn\u2019t do a great deal. All they did was recognize the principle that after a\ncertain point of not eating, you are doomed.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: And \u2014 and there were a lot of doomed people around there. Oh, it was really awful.\nAnd, you know \u2014 well, you\u2019ve all seen pictures of these people; they\u2019re so thin, it\u2019s\nunbelievable. Their veins stood out on their arms and everything.",
        "A: [indecipherable] didn\u2019t seem human. And I wonder how they got along. There was\na good mixture of languages, but you\u2019d have to organize it among the survivors, a few\ncould speak English or French. Otherwise, they were out of communication, really, I\nthink. Maybe some of the Germans mixed in would have been re-reasonable",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Oh, I didn\u2019t stay very long at all. Took my pictures. I knew they wanted them back\nat headquarters, and so I \u2014 I just about jumped in the car, and off we went.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Not very much at all. I realized early on that I couldn\u2019t spend much time\nin \u2014 inside these buildings.",
        "A: Oh well, I think so. I think there was. I only went into one, but it was a \u2014 it was a\npretty sizable thing. I don\u2019t know how many workers they had to have, or they were\nusing for whatever project they were doing. They were \u2014 they were probably cleaning\nJuly 7, 2011\nout the \u2014 the ... the woods, you know, because the Germans do that. They make it a\npolicy, clean out the underbrush wherever they are, and they use it, of course,\nprofitably, to burn.

Well, you know, if \u2014 if the \u2014 if the camp was two miles\naway, I don\u2019t know how they would escape being discovered, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an\nissue. These \u2014 the \u2014 the townspeople all knew about this. I understand that afterwards,\nthe Americans took the Burgermeister and a number of senior civilian officers up to\nwatch this process that I watched; they were still burying these people.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No, I never did. I never did. But I \u2014 but I \u2014 I think that after the war it was well\nknown, and wasn\u2019t quite as dramatic as hanging them with piano wire in Auschwitz.\nBut the \u2014 the whole thing is unbelievable, more-so \u2014 you know, one says that it\u2019s\nunbelievable that a group of people would be killed this way, for nothing other than\nbeing what they are. And that binary nature of these people, who could be very polite\nand \u2014 and com \u2014 polite society, in their polite society, and yet they \u2014 th-there was \u2014 the\nGermans did an analysis of one of their big meetings and it survived the war, and I saw\nit in Germany, in fact. This was after the war. And it was appalling to see these people\nJuly 7, 2011\nwho were responsible for th-th-the disposal of human beings, joking about it and going\nabout it in such a detached way. No \u2014 no \u2014 no emotion involved. Well, but at any rate,\nthat\u2019s not pertinent to what we\u2019re talking about, but \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. It didn\u2019t have to be a visual presentation at all.",
        "A: You just think of the idea, planning and executing these people in such a way.",
        "A: And this was the other way. These were the dregs. These were \u2014 these were not the\npeople who were employed in [indecipherable] plants all through Germany, or \u2014 there\n\u2014 there were a lot of commercial properties that were managed and run by these people.\nSome fantastic stories about that, but seeing it is an emotional experience.",

        "A: No, well, the country is vast.",

        "A: We were all a little anxious, I suppose. We were doing very well, but when you\u2019re in\na battle, if you\u2019re moving forward, you feel pretty good about that, but your \u2014 you\u2019re\nfurther exposing yourself to doom. And the \u2014 I was \u2014 I was not aware of \u2014 of this\nsweep, but I knew it happened. And in fact, after \u2014 after the Battle of the Bulge, our \u2014\nJuly 7, 2011\nour \u2014 our army \u2014 I\u20141I\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m afraid I \u2014I shouldn\u2019t say our army, I wasn\u2019t in the army,\nbut I \u2014 in that army, but because I \u2014 of my personal experience. But oh, the casualties\nwere fearsome. And the men who really fought have a different, instinctive feeling\nabout it. But our infan \u2014 infantry really ch \u2014 went through them so fast, that we had\nsome surprises. We overtook the \u2014 the retreat of the Germans. They\u2019d retreat a while,\nthen they\u2019d surrender. And so \u2014 but as I say, in \u2014 in Austria they got another picture of\nit.",
        "A: Because they were \u2014 these were civilians and \u2014 and the Austrians that were in the\narmy were, of course, in the German army. And so they didn\u2019t have much to do in\nAustria. I know wa \u2014 in our experience, the Austrian takeover was a cinch, after the\nfighting that we had done before.",
        "A: Yes, I was in Linz, Austria.",
        "A: Sure. Sure, I \u2014 the \u2014 the end of war 1s really the end of war for \u2014 for the Austrians,\nthere was nothing. And all the pretty girls, some very eager to cooperate ger \u2014\nAustrians, but not \u2014 not resisting. We had to face the possibility that we\u2019d have to fight\nJuly 7, 2011\nthrough it, but they didn\u2019t have \u2014 they did \u2014 they didn\u2019t have a home guard or anything,\nto give us any trouble, so [inaudible]",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, that\u2019s a different thing entirely, and \u2014 and in retrospect, it\u2019s a funny\nexperience. I enjoyed it so much afterwards, because 1t was so dangerous when it was\ndone.",
        "A: I\u2014 we were \u2014 we were stationed in Linz, in western Austria, and I was \u2014 I \u2014 I had\nattached myself to the \u2014 to the intelligence section of the army. And get \u2014 got to know a\nvery affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too. He was an\ninfantry officer, a big man. I \u2014 apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety\nunder extreme pressure. But at any rate, I reported in one day. It was across town, I was\nwith ya \u2014 with my infantry friends, and \u2014 eating there and so forth. So I came in one\nmorning, about eight o\u2019clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can\u2019t\nremember \u2014 and that\u2019s a shame, you know, that just \u2014 should never forget the name of\nsomebody who made such an impression. But at any rate, he was a good \u2014 good old\nboy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he\nlooked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much\nappreciated. So, he had come into the office just before me, and he got a call from the\ndirector of the museum. And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him\nJuly 7, 2011\nthis way, but he heard about the \u2014 the exchange of troops. We had gone on the \u2014 on the\nu-upper Austrian side of the Donau river, and had \u2014 the Russians had moved in too far\nwhen we \u2014 when we met. There was a clerical error. So that was passed. The Russians\nwere in that territory, we didn\u2019t try to throw them out, of course. But they were\nadvanced maybe \u2014 maybe a couple of miles on \u2014 on what was supposed to be a straight\nline of division. And so they now \u2014 now decided that they would settle all this at the\nvery highest level. Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they\u2019d better\nchange this. So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it,\nthe Russians would pull back, and we would mo \u2014 we\u2019d move forward into that area.\nAnd when \u2014 although we didn\u2019t know anything, or I didn\u2019t know anything, of course,\nlet me say that when I say we don\u2019t know, that means I don\u2019t know. But at any rate, I\ndidn\u2019t know there were planning to do this, they didn\u2019t consult me. And so, both the\nmajor and I were very upset. What happened was, when we first came in, the major\nwent over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly\nreasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to\nhave been put there by Hitler. And \u2014 excuse \u2014",
        "A: The director at that time said that no, there were no pictures, but that we could see\nthat there were spaces where pictures had been. And we didn\u2019t know what \u2014 what wa \u2014\nhappened to them. So \u2014 but nevertheless, any amount of questioning as the director,\nJuly 7, 2011\nproduced no answers. And then of course, suddenly, the \u2014 there came this change, and\nhe discovered what he knew, or something, that the pictures were in a certain farm wa \u2014\nin a\u20141na barn, couple of miles in \u2014 1n that area. And so he said \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right. And he had \u2014 he had the \u2014 in fact, address. He knew exactly how to get\nthere. He\u2019d obviously checked somebody. What they were, were cases, beautifully\nmade, of wood, for each picture, whether it\u2019s small or large, and were beveled off so\nthat they wouldn\u2019t hurt anything. And he said, he se \u2014 he was sort of apologetic because\nhe knew he should have revealed this before. Although I do \u2014 I think if that had\nhappened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him\naway. So we\u2019re probably lucky that this happened. And \u2014 and so, they \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m\nsurprised they didn\u2019t have Russian guards on \u2014 on these things. But, at any rate \u2014",
        "A: No, it was a sort of a\u2014 a spontaneous reaction of idiocy by everybody there, you\nknow, they \u2014 they really \u2014 we all agreed.",
        "A: Yeah, had to get the pictures back. And I don\u2019t know what happened to me. I \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot prone to make profound decisions like this, but \u2014 but he went around, and asked\neach soldier, do you want to go? It\u2019s a little dangerous, but let\u2019s go.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Yeah, this fella, he didn\u2019t know any more than I did really, but at any rate, he\u2019s a\nvery low rank in that big army, and he was making an awful decision. But he \u2014 we\ncould have all been wiped out. Was the craziest thing, going over the Linz bridge, to\nthe other side of the Donau, and feeling that you might be going to your death.\nAnyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or\nsomething, whatever had been assigned to them. And it was a \u2014 I thought it was a\ncomical thing afterwards, but I didn\u2019t think that \u2014 very much that way at the time. So\nwe all went in a little convoy, with the major out ahead in a Jeep, and most of us back\nin the trucks. We had two big trucks, and we didn\u2019t know how much we were going to\nface. Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were\ndriving, I wouldn\u2019t have been that \u2014 that \u2014 that good. But we arrived in there, in the top\nof an enormous barn. You know the way those barns were constructed? They used the\nupper levels for hay that they dropped down in the spring. And so there were the\npictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow \u2014 for the \u2014 the bulls, or what have you. And\nthe \u2014 we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not\nthe \u2014 the heaviest thing was an unusual shape. It was about two feet wide, two feet\nhigh, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh. We c \u2014 we \u2014 we could move\nthe pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn\u2019t know what it was, we couldn\u2019t take\nthe time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take \u2014 take it. So for\nJuly 7, 2011\nour two and a half ton truck, we \u2014 we put it on the \u2014 the \u2014 down early. But it took all the\nmuscular strength we could master. And so when we got back, w-we drove back, and\nthat was a terrorizing experience, because there was nothing but death. Nothing moved\nin that whole distance that we had \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that \u2014 that they had evacuated.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No, no, well, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some took the alternative of going into the cellar, to be\ndiscovered later. But an awful lot of them went visiting the relatives and friends in the\nsafe part of town.",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: No, I saw \u2014 I didn\u2019t even see an \u2014 an ordinary dog. You know, they \u2014 the little street\ndogs everywhere.",
        "A: But we saw nothing breeding in that area.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Oh yeah, I mean, they went visiting or \u2014 or hid in the cellar, too. But at any rate, it\nwas just a naked run really, from the safe sa \u2014 place, to this \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t too long,\nand so I figure a couple miles, maybe. Then we loaded it all up, and came back. And of\ncourse, that was the loneliest automobile trip I ever made. And so we went across the\nbridge and got back, and we \u2014 we decided to put it in the museum, we could put a guard\non it there. And we didn\u2019t have anybody el \u2014 of the ability to examine them, and we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t want to \u2014 there, there was a \u2014 was a big station in \u2014 in south Germany, near\nMunich. Munich th \u2014 yielded an awful lot of those paintings. And they had \u2014 there we\nhad some American \u2014 those specialists, who knew these paintings, you know. You\nneeded somebody like that to make a judgment.",
        "A: No, but we did open up one. The major said, that damn thing that [indecipherable]\nand so forth. He wanted to see what was in it, so we opened it. Was a beautifully\nencased box. And what was it? It was a rowing machine with a [indecipherable] iron\nbase, that apparently the officers wanted to take with them, or get rid of, or something.\nDidn\u2019t want to yield to the Russians, maybe. So in all that happened, we had a good\nlaugh after.",
        "A: Bu-But [indecipherable], it tied us up for a while.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Oh, well you can be sure we did it as fast as we could.",
        "A: And that \u2014 see, that was early in the morning when we first got the word, and the\nmajor took no \u2014 no time making arrangements with the motor office. And, we were up\nand gone in \u2014 1n a matter, I\u2019m afraid, of minutes. Every able-bodied soldier 1n the area\nwere \u2014 well, at least there was a mass of early risers, you know. And the major went\naround, asked each one of them, you know, why they \u2014 why they do this.",
        "A: And he guessed right. Huh \u2014 huh?",
        "A: None \u2014 none that I heard of. I didn\u2019t stay on very much longer. I got reassigned to\nFrance. I was going to go home, and they put me in a safer place, I guess. But oh, I\nwas \u2014 that was quite an experience.",
        "A: Oh yeah. And I \u2014I \u2014 I thought it was, thinking about it afterwards, I thought it was\npretty darn clever of these fellows to say yes, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 then it\u2019s a very freaky\nthing. I\u2019m sure that if you ask the same people, a lot of them would have said no. But\nthat\u2019s th \u2014 I know how those things happen.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was assigned to a place in Mourmelon in France. I then was shipped to\nParis, and got a job as an editor on the \u201cStars and Stripes,\u201d which I thought was a\ndelightful way to finish up with the army. And then in due course I had enough credits\nto come home. Was a lovely assignment there. I don\u2019t know what happened to the\nteletypes. They just never showed up.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. There \u2014 there\u2019s an after play, you might say. I stayed on in \u2014 in\nAustria for quite a time, and these people got out of their cages, and they\u2019d just walk\naround, stupefied. I don\u2019t know how they ate. I \u2014 I was a nonsmoker, and it \u2014 but I took\nmy smoking rations. And cigarettes were worth an awful lot of money. You could get a\ndinner, a whole dinner, for a cigarette in some places. And I had no use for them, so \u2014\nso I\u2014I-\u2014I gave mine away, rather than destroy them. And they di \u2014 they\u2019d know, as\nsoon as they saw the cigarettes, I was being a friendly \u2014 I-I don\u2019t know how they were\ntreated by other soldiers, you know? And it\u2019s a terribly disturbing thing if somebody\nJuly 7, 2011\ncomes up and says in a perfectly modulated civilian voice, something obviously\nunderstandable, if you could understand the language. It\u2019s a terrible feeling.",
        "A: Sometimes they just want a sa \u2014 a cigarette, or some \u2014 or a \u2014 or \u2014 they\u2019d never ask\nfor a cigarette. They\u2019d get it if somebody gave it to them. It was much too valuable a\npiece of property.",
        "A: Yes, right, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 didn\u2019t speak a language that I understood.",
        "A: By then I could get along all right for primitive things in da \u2014 German.",
        "A: I had studied it, and so I ha \u2014 had an advantage. But I don\u2019t know, it \u2014 it seems\nunreal. I don\u2019t even think I \u2014 sometimes I don\u2019t think I ha \u2014 I went there.",
        "A: Yeah. Right.\nJuly 7, 2011",
        "A: Funny experience.",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, thank you.",
