        "STERA KUPFER\nMarch 10, 1992\nBeep.\nTell me what you remember of your impressions when the war began. How life changed.\nWell, the whole summer people were whispering and men were politicking and talking about there's\ngoing to be a war. Uh, our, my life was very beautiful. We lived in a nice house, my father had a good\nbusiness. We just lived a very, very nice life, comfortable life, uh, was the usual luxuries of middle\nclass people, you know, a maid and well-dressed and then going on vacations and, and having good\ntimes. But there was always talk and the men were always whispering, the children were not even\nsupposed to hear, but we knew something is cooking. And then, just prior to 9/1, my father left. Uh, he\nleft to escape the Germans. Rumor was that the children and women were, will be treated civilly. The\nmen would be put to work, or sent to concentration camp or whatever they would do with them. So,\nmy father along with a few men, got a bus and a driver, and decided to leave town, and go to the other\nside so to speak, you know, to the Russian side, which would be occupied by the Russians, and see what\nhappens. Maybe come back, maybe what--. And everything changed. My mother had to go to the\nstore, which she never did before. I was left with my little sister to take care of her. I was 10 years old.\nShe was one, exactly one year old. And, then the rationing came in and, and we had to wear an\narmband, a white armband. There, there were every day there were different, different um rules coming\nout, you know, wearing a white arm band with the blue star of David, and there was a curfew, and\nnumber one, no school for Jewish children. 9/3 was supposed to be a school day, which never\nhappened for the Jewish children, we couldn't go to school. Uh, my mother tried to get us private\ntutoring during that time, which was an older cousin who has graduated already from gymnasium, and\nshe was qualified enough to teach 3rd, 4th, 5th grade. Uh, the children were left more or less to\nthemselves. The parents were busy, either worrying or doing something or being...occupied otherwise.\nUm, but basically, for myself, we stayed in the house for about 2 years, I think, maybe a little less, until\nthe whole thing changed.\nTell me, describe for me the Germans, your impression of them, and describe the Gestapo, and how you\nsaw the---------, what you thought of them.\nOkay. They were walking, well, when they first came in, they came, the army came in, they were\nthrowing candy to the children, and the parents said, \"Don't pick it up, 1t might be poisoned,\" and they",
        "ob-obviously knew about it because they took a bite out of it to show it wasn't. But after they marched\nin, very quietly, not one shot was fired, we watched the Gestapo with the dogs, with the two German\nshepherds on each side, with the polished boots, with the, with the hat, with the pride, with the, with the\n--------------very scary. Just to look at them was scary. They even confiscated a couple dogs from our\nneighbor. They were Dalmatians. To this day, when I see a Dalmatian, a beautiful Dalmatian, I cannot\nhelp but think about this horrible thing because, they just took it, I don't know, in order to give it back\nmaybe later or what. In the meantime, they took them. They were walking with those dogs, they were\nwalking with the German shepherds, and they, they were carrying a thing, I don't know, it was a stick or\nsomething, next to them like, God they were, they were like Gods, they were like, they thought of them\nthemselves, and we were petrified, just to look. You know, you were afraid to look at their faces. And\nthe children were afraid to look at their faces. There was such power. There was such, and such fear in\nus. It was such, you thought, if you just looked at them, they would smite you, they would just throw\nyou against something. Because when are we, we heard about the stories where they didn't waste a shot\non a child because the children were just thrown against a brick or a or a stone wall or something and\nsmashed their heads. So as children, we were very much afraid, very much afraid to just look at them.\nUh, nothing you could do about it.",
        "Did your mother know what was going on during this time, and how much did she tell you of what was\ngoing on?",
        "I don't know how much she knew. She prob--she didn't tell much. She didn't want to, I don't know, the,\nthe, the upbringing of children in Europe was such, you don't tell, you don't upset the children, you don't\ntell the children. The children are protected. The children are gentle. You don't upset children. But,\nevery day, there were people called to go to, to labor. You know, to pull stones out of the river in order\nto make little bricks to build the roads. You know when I was in Europe, and I saw the roads built in a\nsort of uh pattern, um, with that scalloped pattern, I know that the Jews built that road, out of the stones\nthat were pulled out of the water that they had to manually make into squares. This is what they were\ndoing. And there were some people that couldn't do that kind of work. There were sick people, there\nwere older people. Some people never came back from that work. Either they dropped, or they got\nsick, or whatever. So, the, the first year and a half when they came into my town was mostly this sort of\nthing. They were catching people to, to go to work and, and confiscating merchandise from the store.\nThey would come with big trucks and confiscate a lot of--my father had a hardware store, and they\nneeded a lot of stuff from the store. And they would always give my mother a shine or a, a, a bill to\ncollect a hundred years from now, whatever, nobody believed it. Uh, so this was mostly what was\ngoing on, there was a lot of hunger, there was, food was not available. Uh, people stood in line for\nhours to get a piece of bread, you know, that was hard bread or, or, or so soft that it was almost raw.",
        "Either way. Personally, we were in a lucky position because, before my father left, he provided, he\ncalled the mill and had delivered, had them deliver a sack of white flour and black flour, and also told\nmy mother to buy a sack of salt and sugar. Apparently he remembered something from the first war.\nAnd, personally I was not hungry. We took the flour to the baker, and he baked bread for us, so I was\nquite fortunate as far as that goes.\nTell me about your responsibilities when your mother went to work.\nWhen my mother went to work, I had to take care of my little sister. I couldn't go to play. Naturally she\nwanted to run after me. Uh, she was a year old. I trained her to go to the potty, and to this day, she\nreminds me that af-after a while, I also taught her how to carry the potty out. She still remembers this.\nI (laughs), I was trying to---------, I guess. So, we went along most of the time until my mother got\nsomebody to stay with us. Uh, she could very well afford it, and she got a woman to stay, clean the\nhouse and stay with the children, and this gave me an opportunity to go out and play. Not a whole lot\nbecause we didn't want to be very visible, but in the backyard a little bit, we did.\nYour family refused to register, am I right about that?\nYes.\nTell me about that.\nOkay. One day, there was, there was an order that everyone should come to the city hall and register. I\ndon't know why, my mother said, \"I'm not going to register.\" Neither she nor her parents, nor her sister\nregistered, including the children. We had no idea what it was for, but we just didn't. The day after,\nthere was another order. All people that registered had to come to the city hall, was whatever, if they\nwanted to carry something, they'll be sent out. And I'll never forget, I was in my grandparent's house\nstanding with my aunt in the window, and we saw people, it was a rainy day.\nWait, we have to do this one again. We just ran out. So we'll have to start that again on the next roll.\nOkay.\nBeep.\nNow when you tell me about what you did refusing to register, just start at the beginning as though you",
        "haven't told it already.\nAll right. You have to ask me the question again?\nOkay. Your family refused to register. Tell me about that.\nOkay. One day, there was an order. Everybody has to come and register at the city hall. My\nmother for some reason refused to go, and also her sister and her parents and the children. I don't\nknow why, but this was her decision, and we didn't register. The following day, there was another\norder. Everybody that registered yesterday, come to City Hall, and get your belongings. So, I\nremember standing in my grandpar-parents house with my aunt in the window, and it was a rainy\nday, and we saw all these people going with little packages, with little bundles in their hands,\ncarrying children, children by the hand, going in the direction of the river. We had no idea where\nthey are going, but later we found out, they were all going toward the River ---------, and across the\nborder to the Russian side. For some reason, that one day, they opened the, the border, and the\nGermans got rid of these people, and the Russians accepted them. We felt very, very sorry for\nthem. Look where they are going. We are still in our home. It's warm, it's not raining, we have\nwhat to eat. Poor people, they went. Little did we know, that these people would remain alive\nbecause they would remain side, maybe they'll be sent to Siberia later on, all this, we didn't know.\nWe were safe in our homes. We didn't know. We didn't know.\nNow describe to me the escape that you made on the train with your sister.\nOkay. At one time, they were going to erect the ghetto, and people between 18 and 40 could go\ninto the ghetto. Everybody else was going to be sent somewhere else. Nobody knew where. My\nmother had two children, ten, my, at that time, 11-1/2 probably, and 1-1/2 or 2. Well, she knew she\ncan't go with the children into the ghetto. So she decided to do something about it. My aunt, she\nhad a sister who lived in a different city, and the action was over in that city. In other words, they\nwent through their selection, and she said to me, \"Get on the train, and go to Krasno,\" this was the\ncity where my aunt lived, \"find out if they're alive, maybe we can join them.\" I knew they weren't\nat their old address. This I knew. So, I got on a train, and I went to Krasno, and I looked up the\nJewish Community Center or whatever that was called at that time, it had a different name in\nPolish. And I went there, and I asked about the family, and they told me, \"Yes, they're alive, they,\nthey survived the selection and they're working in a factory.\" And they told me where to go, and I\ndid. When I came there, my aunt said, \"Just stay with us. Don't go back. We have to be here. We\nare working.\" And, I had a cousin who is a year older than I. She says, \"Somehow we'll inter-\ninterchange the two of you, and you stay with us. Don't go back, there's no future there, you'll all",
        "get killed. Just stay here.\" I said, \"I can't do that, I have to go back.\" So, I went back. It was a\nFriday night, I came home. And, I don't know what made me say it. To this day, I really don't\nknow. I said to my mother, \"Tante Malca said we should come to stay with them.\" My mother\ntook my word for it. So the next day, she contacted a Polish lady, who was going to take my sister\nand me to Krasno, and my mother, and come back, and take my mother later. She didn't want all of\nus to travel together because we would be recognized, especially my mother, you know. Children\nis different. And, so it was, she packed up a suitcase, she gave me a briefcase with some stuff, I\ndidn't know what was in it, and we went to the station, and as soon as the train started moving,\nsome people said, \"I think these are Shverga's??? children travelling.\" My father was very well-\nknown in the city, and they recognized the children, and the minute the woman heard this, she\ndisappeared. She got out of the compartment, and she disappeared. I didn't know what to think\nabout it, but when this, we came to the station, my sister and I got off, and right there, at the stairs,\nthere were two very tall Secret Service men, and they asked me my name, and they said, uh, they\nasked me my name first, and I said, \"Stefa Nevayetska.\" This was my neighbor's daughter's name,\nand they said to me, \"So where are you, who are you coming to, where are you going?\" And I said,\n\"We are coming to my aunt, but she's not here, and I don't what to do.\" I was petrified. I knew\nwhat all this meant. Um, they did not wear a uniform, but we knew Secret, uh, you know, what\nSecret Service looked like, and, I'm looking around, I don't see that woman, and, I didn't know what\nto do, and an-anyways, they asked me if was Jewish, I said, \"No.\" And, again, they asked me what,\nwho are we coming to. I said, \"Well, my aunt is not here. I don't know where she lives, and I don't\nknow how to get to her house.\" I really don't know what spoke through me. I wasn't prepared for\nit. And, as a child I never lied. I still don't to this day, but something spoke through me, I, I really\nbelieve it, and they said, \"Well, then we'll have to take you to the police.\" I said, \"That's a very\ngood idea. Maybe you can help me locate my aunt.\" And, inside I was praying, I was hoping they\nwon't ask for her name, because I didn't have a name for her. I couldn\u2019t, could not have said her\nreal name. And I was not prepared for name, but they never asked. And we, they, well, they\nstarted walking us, and they were asking what was in my briefcase. It was actually a big schoolbag\nthat I had, leather, and I said, \"I really don't know. My mother packed it.\" And, one of them said,\n\"Oh, a couple days ago, a girl just like you, Jewish, came here, and she had a bag just like yours,\nleather bag, and you know what was in it? Five kilos of gold.\" I said, \"Well, I don't think I have 5\nkilos of gold, but you're welcome to open it up. And they opened it up, and I almost died on the\nspot, because what was in that bag was some tomatoes that my mother picked from the garden, and\na big Jewish bread, like a twisted challa. Now, everybody knows in Poland that only Jews eat a\ntwisted challa for Shabbat. Polish people never eat a twisted Challa Shabbat. They may have a\ntwisted bread for Easter, but not Shabbat. When I saw this, I was sure that they would know who I\nam. I must have had a guardian angel, oh maybe, my dead father was watching over us. They",
        "didn't see it. They didn't acknowledge it. They didn't pay attention. They closed the bag. But they\nquestioned us, again and again and again. Your name. Where did you come, this...In the meantime,\nit was a hot day, and my little sister got tired, and she called me by my Jewish name, that she is\ntired. \"Soluna, I'm tired, I can't walk.\" And I said, \"Stefa cannot help you. I'm tired myself.\" She\nsaid, \"Soluna,\" and I said, \"Stefa.\" Now any Polish man knows that Sala, Sara, Soluna, is a Jewish\nname. Stefa, Stefa is a Christian name. They didn't hear my little sister. I truly considered this a\nmiracle. Finally, they said to me, um, \"Okay, you can go. You can go.\" So, I said to myself, \"All\nright, we'll go, and they'll follow me, and they'll know exactly where I'm going,\" because I knew\nwhere my aunt had an apt., even though they were working in a camp, they still kept an apt. So, we\nwere going around and around in circle, and the heat was incredible, but we walked around, and I\nkept looking back, but I didn't see them. Finally I decided to take a walk. And we walked to the\napartment.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nWhy don't you pick that up, and then I want to jump right into --------------.\nOkay.\nRemember where you were, you and your sister starting to walk.\nOkay. We started to walk towards my aunt's apt. When we came there, the house was locked.\nThere was nobody in the house. There were 2 outhouses, so I decided to go and sit in the outhouse\nuntil the landlady would come because we were afraid to sit outside. We sat in the stinking\nouthouse for a long time until the landlady came. When she came, we came out, and she has met\nme before because at one time that I was there, my cousin took me to the place, and she knew who\nI was, and I ask her could we come in, and she says, \"Yeah, I'll let you into your aunt's apt.,\" and\nshe let us in. Nobody knew where we were because the lady that took us across never showed up,\nand we were sitting 1n the apt all alone, the 2 of us, until somebody from the family came, I don't\nknow how many days later, sitting there crying we were. I didn't know about my mother, if she is\nalive, she didn't know about us, if we were alive, she had no idea what happened to us, she kept\ngoing back to the woman's house, and she must have been hiding from her because her husband\nonly kept saying, \"Because of you I lost my wife. She never came back, which in retrospect, I\nrealize that she did come back, because nothing did happen to her, nobody caught her. So my",
        "mother didn't know what happened to us, and she subsequently went into hiding for a few days in\norder to be uh out of the ghetto so she should be uh, uh reconnected with us. Now, the way we\nwere reconnected is another miracle. My mother went into hiding, and then after a few days, she\nsent a man into Krasno to look for 2 children. She had no idea where her sister lived. She had no\nidea what happened to us. The poor man was walking the streets. He, he didn't know who to ask.\nHe didn't know where to go. Finally, he approached a young woman, and asked her if she knew\nabout Eddinger family. And that was my cousin. Why he asked her, only, I don't know. She\nbrought him over, and he told me, \"Your mother is alive, I'm going to bring her in, in a few days.\"\nAnd, he did. At night, he bandaged her face, supposedly that she has a big toothache, and she came\nwith his wife's uh Ausweihs?? and we, we, we got reconnected. Now we stayed in my aunt's apt\nfor a few days, and my mother talked to Mrs. Olefska, who was the landlady, and she said, \"What\nare we to do?\" She says, \"I'll tell you what. Your sister paid a month's rent. She only stayed here\n2 weeks. She didn't want any money back. You can stay for 2 weeks of the remainder of the\nmonth, for what your sister paid. My mother said, \"Fine. Very nice.\" After 2 weeks, she said to\nMrs. Olefska, \"What do we do now?\" And she said, \"I don't think I can throw you out. You have\nnowhere to go. I'm going to keep you as long as I can.\"\nAll right. Now I'm going to interrupt you. Describe Mrs. Olefska for me, and then just tell me in\ngeneral what she did for you, your mother and your sister.\nMrs. Olefska was, well, first I have to say, she's an angel. She went straight to heaven. She was a\nbeautiful, physically beautiful woman. Tall, with swept up hair, beautiful smile, deeply religious,\nwith a heart of gold, obviously. The woman went to mass every single day, and if she sold a piece\nof jewelry for us, what my mother gave her, and my mother would say, \"Take a little money from\nthis,\" she would not accept it. And Mama would say, \"Take a little money when you go to mass,\nand give it to the poor.\" And she would say, \"There are no poorer people than you. Your children\nhave no fresh air. You have no light. You have no freedom. Nobody is poorer than you.\" She\nwouldn't take a penny, never, she never took a penny. She did it out of the goodness of her heart.\nShe was incredible. And we didn't even have a chance to thank her, because after the war, not after\nthe war actually, after the liberation, when my mother went back to her, and, you know, just, just to\ntell her that we're going back to our hometown and, she says, \"Please, don't stay in touch with me.\nDon't ever come back. I don't want my neighbors to see you. I am afraid for the safety of my, of\nmy life. My Polish people, my Polish brothers, will not forgive me for saving a Jewish life.\" She\nwas in jeopardy, and we never could say thank you. (Cries)\nTell me for how long she hid you, and tell me some of the logistics of hiding, how hard was it for",
        "her?\nWell, at first we were in this room. I don't exactly know if it was a year or two or maybe 18\nmonths. It really is difficult for me to put a time on it, but it was for a long time. So at first we\nwere in my aunt's apt, but because housing was scarce, people were on her back uh, to rent it out.\nYou know, why don't you rent out the apt, it's an empty apt, and she always found an excuse, but\nfinally a member of her family, a distant member of her family said, needed an apt, and she had to\nlet them have it. So, she put us up in an attic. It was actually an attic room, you know, one of\nthose, and we were, had to be extremely quiet because we walk upstairs, you can hear it\ndownstairs. That is...so we were quiet, we were either walking on tippy toes or just sitting on a\nbed. She would bring us a pot of soup and some bread, and again her goodness. The bread was\nsometimes 2 or 3 weeks old because, you know, bread was rationed, so her brother would go to the\narmy to buy bread. He had to go to the other side of town to buy bread. And it was stamped with\nthe date, and we were laughing about it, sometimes it was 10 days old, sometimes 2 weeks old, was\nhard as rock, and so she came up with the idea that she's going to buy some apples, and if you\nscrape apples, and put them on bread, it will soften the bread for the children. This is how\nconcerned she was. But, this too had to end because somebody else needed the room upstairs. A\nyoung student wanted the room. And, she did not have any excuse not to rent it out. Can I get a\ntissue, ughh, please, I don't know if you can stop. I feel I'm dripping. Take 4 1s up. Okay. Beep.\nLet's just back up a little bit to the food, and also tell me how she respected your mother's religion.\nI will. Okay. I told you that she cooked soup for us. Now, my mother was very orthodox. Mrs.\nOlefska was deeply religious, and she respected my mother's religion also. She knew that it had to\nbe kosher. So she took one pot, which she said she'll scrub it out real good, and she won't use any\nfat at all. So, she cooked potato soup for us every single day, she browned some flour first, never\ntou--and she had one spoon, she bought a new spoon, and she had this one pot, which she always\nused only for us. My mother didn't have any un-kosher food for the duration of the hiding. Never\nin her life for that matter, but this is how she respected my mother's religiousness. This by itself\nshould tell you something about her character.\nBeep.\nTalk to me about what it was like to have to live in hiding, to be in the darkness, what you did ------",
        "First of all, we had to be very very quiet. We could not talk. In fact, after the war, none of us had\nvoices. We were totally hoarse. We lost our voices from whispering. As a matter of fact, uh what\nI gave up, I gave up my childhood. We were never playing, we would never go outside, uh, after a\nwhile, we went into a basement where we were hiding. We could hear children play outside. We\ncould hear music played in an upstairs apt. We could hear people walking. We had none of this.\nWe had no sunshine. As a matter of fact, I developed a goiter. My neck became totally swollen.\nOne day my mother said to Mrs. Olefska, \"Look at her.\" And she says, \"Oh, my God, even if she\nlives through, she'll be a cripple.\" So, being summer, it must have been the next summer already,\non a very quiet afternoon, Mrs. Olefska came in the basement, and she says, \"You have to come\nwith me.\" And she took me, it was very quiet day, there was nobody on the street. She took me\nout on a hill, and she says, \"You have to sit in the sun. You have no sun. Maybe that will help\nyou.\" And she did it quite a few times. Uh, I have a perfectly good neck, thanks to her. Um, to\npass the time, I taught my sister how to read the newspaper, so the first time the newspaper came,\nthe 2 year old read it before we did. Including the obituary and the matrimonial, and the lost and\nfound, and the...ads, and all the politics and everything. We tried to remember songs. We used to\nwhisper songs to each other. And one day she said to me, \"Let's write it down. Maybe when we\nlive. Maybe if we live, we could sing these songs.\" So, I, I, I used to sing a lot when I was a child,\nand I had an older cousin who used to teach me all the newest uh, what you call it uh, the newest\nsongs. And, we wrote down like 23 of them. Um, oh we also watched the rats go by. Mostly we\njust sat around. I taught myself how to knit. Took apart an old sweater, and I found some knitting\nneedles, and taught myself how to knit. I read everything that was there. Mrs. Olefska being a\nvery pious woman, she had some religious magazines there, and Saint Anthony became my saint,\nand I prayed to him too. Uh, I don't remember anymore a saint of who he was, but I adopted him.\nHe was from Padua. So, many times when my mother had to leave for a while and didn't come\nback immediately, I would pray to my father, I would pray to God, and I would pray to St.\nAnthony, whoever would listen. Ah...",
        "What about fear? Were you afraid a lot of the time?",
        "The fear was constant. The fear was non-stop. The fear was that somebody will come into the\nbasement. The fear was that somebody will listen. The fear was that somebody will give a cough.\nMy sister developed uh whooping cough, which is a horrible cough with a lot of loud coughing.\nWe taught the little one to put a large pillow over her face. I don't know how she didn't suffocate.\nWhen the attack came, she coughed into the pillow. The fear was constant. A, a wrong word from\nsomebody. Uh, I don't know how, but somebody must have noticed some action around the\nbasement, although they were very careful. The woman that lived upstairs in the apt that we",
        "previously occupied said, said one day to Mrs. Olefska, she says, \"You know, after the war, after\nthe war is over, I wonder about those Jews that are hiding here. I wonder what they would, how\nthis would come out, what, what would happen, how they would behave.\" And she was so\ninnocent she did not expect anything, or suspect anything, she says, \"Why, um, I think it will be all\nright.\" This gave it away, she didn't realize, and immediately the woman went and told on us, but\nanother miracle happened. The Russian front was coming closer and there was bombing, and Mrs.\nOl--and, I have to tell you, I have to describe the basement. There was a staircase going down from\nthe house, and there was a door going out into the backyard, into the garden, and it was always\nlocked. We were locked in, except for when they came to take our pail, and to bring us food and\nwater. This one day, Mrs. Olefska's brother came down, and he said to my mother, \"You know\nwhat, I'm going to leave the door to the, to the garden open tonight. There's a lot of bombing going\non. What if the house if bombed, and you're caught in the fire. You have to have an escape, you\ncan't, you, you are locked in. So, he left the door unlocked, I mean, the door was closed, but not\nlocked on a lock. This was the same day when the woman talked to Mrs. Olefska about us.\nNaturally, it didn't take long as she went and told, and, at night, we hear people coming down the\nstairs, knocking on the door. ------------------------------, \"Jews, open up!\" We were in our night\nclothes, and I said to my mother, \"The door is open, let's get out, let's go into the garden.\" At first\nMama was hesitant, but I started running, she came after me with my sister. We were in our night\nclothes, we hid in the bushes, and a second later, they were inside, and we could see the flashlight\ngoing around. They found our bed. We were sure they were going to search more, and then we\nheard them laugh, they says, \"Oh the old man is probably sleeping here. He is afraid of the bombs.\nThere is nobody here,\" and they left. Call it what you want. That's a miracle. After this, she took\nus back in for one day, and she said, \"You can't be here any longer. It's suspicious. You have to\nfind a place.\" And she told us where to go. There was a woman living alone in a field. She was a\nmaid in the city. She built herself a little house, a two-room house, a little bedroom and a kitchen.\nSo she lives all by herself. The child still is coughing, go to her, and tell her, it used to be said that\nif you have whooping cough, a change of city, a change of climate will help. She says, \"You have\nthe perfect excuse. Go to the woman, tell her you are coming with a sick child, and Mama did that.\nShe went to the woman, said, told her this, and she rented us the kitchen. She occupied the\nbedroom, and we had the kitchen, and my sister was coughing, and this was a very rigid excuse,\nyou know. Well, after a while, my sister stopped coughing. It went away. And the woman,\neverybody was suspicious. She says, \"Well, the child 1s not coughing anymore, and why don't you\ngo back.\" So my mother said, \"Look, they're looking for me. They, you know, they want to send\nme to labor, uh slave labor in Germany. You know, they took Polish people also. And, since I\nhave no husband, I cannot leave my children with my brother or sister all day. My sister was not\nvery good to my children. So I really don't have where to go, and I'm running away from the",
        "Germans because I don't want to go to slave labor.\" Never mentioning being Jewish, you know we\nhad papers and all this. She says, \"Oh, you're just telling me this. You, you don't have a brother.\"\nMomma said, \"Why, you want to meet my brother? Okay.\" So she wrote to a man, who used to be\na customer in my father's store. He also used to be a customer after my father was away, and\nMama had the store. And, she wrote to him to come and see us, and be, be a brother for the day.\nNow, there's a whole story about this man, too, maybe I'll tell you later, but now I want to tell you\nhow we came. Anyways, he came, and she was at work. He brought a bottle of vodka, he brought\nfood for us, he never came empty-handed, and he wanted, waited for the woman to come home\nfrom work. And, he was, he was a nice Polish man, with Polish looks, with Polish speak, speech, I\nmean, you couldn't mistake him for anything else. And, he came and Mama introduced him as her\nbrother, and we were his nieces, and he spoke to her, and he said to her, \"You know, I have a very\nnice wife, but she doesn't like my sister, and she doesn't like her children, and you have to help this\nwoman out, otherwise the, the Germans are going to take her for slave labor into Germany, and\nwhat's going to be with the children. And he gave her Schnapps, and she was in a good mood, and\nhe left her the whole bottle, and a big salami on top of it, and he left. And, to this day, I think she's\nconvinced that he's the brother. So, she accepted this. She let us be.\nWe have to reload.\nBeep.\nBecause I realize you're going to select what you want to select, but I think it's important.\nYeah, go. Go ahead, tell me about that.\nOkay. Well, first I want to tell you that for the longest time I didn't speak about all this because I\ndidn't think that my story was that important, compared to all the other horror stories that I have\nheard from other people. But I feel it's very important to know that people like Penny Olefska and\nPandish Vitsky??? were truly one in a million. Not only that they helped because in helping, you\nrisk your own life. You could be caught in the same fate------------the Jews. But, pointing the\nfinger, that was the easiest thing to do, and lots and lots of people did it. More, the Germans could\nnot distinguish who was Jewish and who was not. They didn\u2019t' know. They didn't know. They\ncouldn't recognize, especially if you were blond and had blue eyes, and didn't have an accent.\nNobody knew. There is a lot of Polish people with black eyes and black hair and and, even\ncrooked noses. They couldn't tell. It was the Polish people, 99.9% who were pointing the finger.\nAnd for a measly 5 slake, for a head, they would get it. But people like Mrs. -----------, Penny",
        "Olefska, and Pandish Vitsky??? were truly angels from God. They risked their lives, they risked\ntheir lives of their families, of their possessions, of everything. They truly believed that they had to\nhelp. Penny Olefska told us a story that when she was a little girl, she was crossing a pond, coming\nhome from school, and the ice broke, and she was drowning, and a man was passing by and pulled\nher out, was a Jewish man. When the, when this happened, she said to my mother, maybe he saved\nmy life in order so I should save Jewish lives. How many people do you know that would feel that\nkind of gratitude. Such a mission in life. I mean, this 1s, this is incredible. This is an example that,\nthat people all over the world should, should take how to care and how to sympathize, and how to\nfeel with a human, with a fellow human being. How to help other people. I just had to tell you this.\nTell me now about your mother, and her ingenuity. How did she, tell me about some of the things\nshe did to sort of plan for taking care of you. Like ---------------------.\nYeah, well, before my father left, he, as I told you, he provided for food, and told her to buy\nclothing and shoes, it's going to be scarce. And since she had this store for a while, whatever\nmoney she had, she bought dollars?? for it. And she wrapped it around, women at that time used to\nwear a corset, and the corset had like stiffs, so, I don't know what you call it. She would take this,\nwrap the money around it, and put it in that corset, she always had money on her, so she would\nremove it and from time to time exchange it. And Mrs. Olefska's brother took care of this. So, we\nactually had enough money to live through. Of course, you realize that we didn't pay for our keep,\nonly for our food. And then we, she sold jewelry too. She had lots of jewelry, and uh, she sold that\ntoo. Money to survive. Um, and, and...\nAll right, tell me how you ended up back at Mrs. Olefska's in the basement with the German --------\n-------------, So, you have to describe this for me as though I don't know anything else.\nOkay. We, at one ti--at one point, we had to come back into the basement. Oh, I know. We had to\nleave the woman, the woman's house, even though she believed that Ishbitsky was our uncle and\nbrother, she said, \"Look, enough is enough, I need this room for myself, you have to leave.\" So,\nMama went back to Penny Olefska because she was in touch constantly. She was the one that\nprovided us with food. She says, \"What are we going to do?\" She said, \"The only thing to do 1s we\ncan get a sled, and send you to Ishbitsky.\" Okay. It was wintertime, and she ordered a sled for us.\nIt was early Sunday morning, which was a big mistake, but we got on the sled, and we went into\nthe Ishbitsky's village. When we arrived, we arrived just in time for all the people to come out of\nchurch. And, everybody said, \"Aha! 3 Jewish women are going to the Ishbitsky.\". They knew.",
        "The whole village knew that the Ishbitsky's against Germans, that he is in the underground. She, he\ndoes everything against it, and they knew that we are going straight to him. And they knew what\nhe is, but nobody would give us out at that point. So, he rented us a place for one month. Not in\nhis house, but somewhere else. And, we stayed for a month. After this, he says, \"You have to go\nback. You cannot be here because there's too many people that know about you.\" So, he rented us\nanother sled, and sent us back to Krasnow. And, under the disguise of darkness, we went back to\nPenny Olefska, and she took us back into the basement. Was a month later, it was quiet there. We\ncame back. The front, the Russian front was coming closer. And, the street got evacuated, and the\nGermans occupied the houses, and Mrs. Olefska was still upstairs, but she told them that one of the\nbasements, they could have. The basement was divided into 3. One part built, and like 3 different\nrooms. One part belonged to the tenants. The 2 other rooms were like adjoining rooms that\nbelonged to the Olefskas. So, they were next door to us, and we could hear the radio, we could\nhear everything that's going on. We, we knew all the politics, we, we could hear how far the front\nis because the radio was on all the time. My mother understood German. And, one day, I don't\nknow how it happened, we hear somebody is coming, so we quickly ran into the next room. The\nnext room was full of Olefska's stuff, her bedding, her food because you know, they expected\nbombing so they put everything in the basement. It was filled to the ceiling, so we climbed over\nthis whole thing, we hid in the corner. Sure enough, the Germans went next door. I, I, I don't\nknow, that they didn't hear us run, they didn't see us, it's a miracle. We hid there, we closed the, we\njust closed the door, shut the door, we couldn't close it, we just shut it, and we hid in that corner,\nand we sat in that corner like 3 mouse, 3 mice. We sat there for 2 or 3 days. Uh, eventually we got\nvery hungry. There was no food. So we found some stuff that Mrs. Olefska took down, and we\nstarted eating from it, and Mama said, \"For God's sake, this 1s not ours, we cannot eat this food. It\ndoesn't belong to us. But we were children, and this took like 2, 3 days. The Germans were behind\nthe wall. Finally, Mrs. Olefska's brother came, he couldn't stand it any longer. During the day he\ncame, he looked around, I don't think anybody was in the basement, maybe they went on some\nexercise or something, nobody was there, and he knocked on the window, he real, he realized the\ndoor was closed, so he knew we were inside. He knocked on the window, and we opened it up,\nand he said he's still alive, and he said, \"Give me the pail.\" That was the first thing, \"Give me the\npail.\" Because we took the pail with us because otherwise it would be obvious that somebody was\nthere. And one by one, he pulled us out through that window. This is actually when my mother\nhurt her arm, which later became infected, which later 1s another story. He pulled us out, and he\ntold us, \"Look the Russians, the Russsian front is around the corner. The street is evacuated.\nNobody is in the street. Just go to a public bunker. There is a public bunker in the middle of the\ncity. Everybody is going there. Go with the children, say you are from...ever, from whatever you\nwant to be. Mama said, \"Okay.\" So we went to the public bunker, and everybody was there. I",
        "mean, people from villages, people from houses, people from, from all over, from the city, and\nmama said to me, you know, we have no food. Go out and see if you can get some food. I was the\nleast suspicious-looking one. So, I went out, and came back, and Mama says to me, \"----------------\n\"They were whispering that we looked very pale. It was summertime.\nWe need to reload.\nChange film, Camera Roll 6 is up; Sync take 7 is up.\nBack up to going to shelter. Okay. Beep.\nAnd give the context. Here we were 3 pale Jews in hiding for so many, for more than...\nOkay. We went, okay, we had to go in the public bunker. We were in hiding for a long time. We\nwere pale.\nWait. Let's sust wait till this truck goes by.\nOkay, let's do it again. Sorry.\nThat's okay. We went into the public bunker. We were very pale, and when I came back from\nwhere my mother sent me, she says, \"Oh, they recognized us. They are whispering. They're saying\nwe must be Jewish because the children are very pale. We've got to go.\" So we left. Mrs.\nOlefska's brother told us something before we went into this bunker. He says, \"If you really, really\nhave no other choice, I'll give you a place to go. There is a crazy professor that has a house. He's\ncrazy. He's harmless. If you have no other choice, go to his house.\" He told us where it is. So, we\nwent to his house. We came there, and he says, \"Welcome. God sent me guests.\" Fine. So we\nstayed in the house, and middle of the night, I hear him run naked, never saw a naked man in my\nlife at that point, and he's pulling my mother by the hand, \"Come, I've got to show you something.\"\nAnd don't forget, when you are frightened, everything frightens you. So, he's pulling my mother\nby the hand, I'm behind my mother, my sister behind me, we're all running. Says, \"I've gotta show\nyou something.\" There's a holy light burning. And he's pulling her to the window, and he has a\ngas line going, with a flame. The holy light is there burning because he got company. In the\nmeantime, we died 100 deaths, because we have no idea where he's pulling us, what he's going to\nshow us. But we stayed in his house. We stayed in his house until the Russian front came. And\nthen this house had to be evacuated too, and we went to some village, I have no recollection of",
        "what. We came there, but that time we weren't so pale anymore. We came there and we went into\nthe bunker. Everybody was in the bunker again because there was bombing, and there was\nkapo???, and they befriended my mother. And, the women were making plans after the war, we're\ngoing to go to the big city, they're going to open the store because the war was toward the end.\nAnd when the Russians came in and my mother told her who she is, she wouldn't believe it. And\nshe would not have anything to do with her. She wanted to have no part of her. Well, it's, that's\nokay, the Russians liberated us at this point.\nTell me who you Ishbitsky??? was, tell me what you know about him. What did he do?\nOkay. Ishbitsky was my father's customer. He had a farm, he is a farmer in the big farm. He used\nto be a customer. He would come and buy from my father. When the war started, and my father\nwasn't there anymore, he used to come and buy from my mother. He many times brought us fresh\neggs and butter from the farm, and, of course, Mama paid him for it. And, he also used to like to\ngo into the back room where there was storage. And, every time Mama would home from the\nstore, and bring fresh eggs and butter and chicken, whatever he brought from the farm, she would\nsay, \"Now Vishbitsky came and he brought us this, and he also went into back room, and I know\nthat he filled his pockets, but I cannot say anything to him. I actually didn't see it, I just know he\ndoes it. But I didn't see it with my eyes, and I cannot go and touch his pockets.\" So he was\nactually stealing. My mother said never a word.\nWait. Let's cut for a minute.-------------------------\nTake 8 is up.\nBut the truth of the matter was that um, he maybe felt some gratitude.\nBeep.\nI want you to---\n----------------false start; that was take 8.\nTell me more about how difficult 1t was in Poland to be a rescuer, and how many denouncers there\nwere. I mean people cling to the rescue stories because they're the hope for humankind. The\nrescue stories are, how do you feel about that.",
        "Well, the rescue sto-stories are wonderful. Not enough. There were not, there were some rescuers,\nno question about it. But there were more people that denounced people, that pointed their finger.\nIt was very difficult to be a rescuer. You faced the same, I think I said that, uh, you faced the same\npenalties. Even worse. They were hung for everybody to see. Uh, yet a lot of people did it. A lot\nof people did this for money, but a lot of people like in our case, did it out of the goodness of their\nheart. They just did it, they thought it was a Christian way to do it. It was, it, but most of the\npopulation pointed a finger, pointed us out. The Germans could not distinguish who was and who\nwas not a Jew, except if they pulled a man's pants down. Women, for sure they could not\ndistinguish. Uh, so, I think that 1t wouldn't be for the Polish people, there would be a lot of people\nalive, a lot of people were in, in the woods hiding, a lot of people were running, having, hiding in\ncemeteries, hiding all places. Germans wouldn't go looking there for them. But they went there\nafter they were told where to go. Simple as that. Hide and go seek.\nWhat do you know about the pogroms after...\nAfter the war? Well, we came back to our hometown after liberation. It wasn't, it wasn't after the\nwar, it was after liberation, the war wasn't over yet. We couldn't go back to our house because our\nhouse was part of the ghetto, it was uh leveled. They built a road there. Our house and my\ngrandparents\u2019 house was gone. They built a road. And we lived in an apt in the city. There was a\nfew people that were rescued. There was a father and 3 daughters that were in hiding, and other\npeople came, coming out like from the woods or from the partisans, and I have to back up because\nthere was a group of people in hiding during the occupation about 20 people that were hiding in a\nwoman's basement, and the local a-army, the Polish Underground, knew about them, and they\ncame to kill them off. That was during the occupation. At that point, they bought their lives with\ngold and silver and money, whatever they had. They just bought themselves out. Besides, they\nconvinced the attackers, there was a barrack up there. They convinced them if they get killed, the\nwoman that was in her house, what would happen to her. So somehow they let it be. These same\npeople showed up at the man's house, the man and 3 daughters who came back and lived in their\nhouse, they came there one afternoon and they said, \"This time, you cannot buy your life with\nmoney. And they shot them. There was also a young boy there visiting. He was shot. One of the\ngirls survived. Somehow she was in another room, and she hid under the bed. After this, we left\nour hometown because nobody was safe. We, this time we were running from our own Polocks.\nWhat, list for me the things you lost???",
        "I lost my track. What?...I lost my father, I lost my education, I lost...I lost who I was, of of what I\ncould have become. My parents had great hopes for me. There was a piano coming into the house,\nI was going to start music. My parents had, they were going to send me to the best schools. I lost\nfriends. I lost family, I lost, I lost grandparents, and aunts, and uncles and cousins. There's, there's\nno family. I have friends now that I consider family because I don't have any family. Um, I'm not\neven going to talk about uh, material possessions. My parents had a beautiful home, and a\nwonderful business, and they were very wealthy, and...gone with the wind.\nOkay. I am your -------.\nCamera 7 is up; Sync take 9 is up. This is the first time we haven't changed tape, and that's going\nto be the 3rd camera roll with this sound roll.\nBeep. Beep.\nTell me what is the legacy of a survivor.\nThe legacy is that each and every one of us has a story to tell. It's never enough, no matter how\nmany books have been written. Everyone is different. And it is our obligation to talk about it, and\nto talk about the rescuers because if it would be not for them, there would be no one to tell this\nstory. There's a lot of doubt about the Holocaust. Believe me, there was one, and if you don't\nbelieve the survivors, ask the rescuers. And, if we lead a semi-normal life, this, this is a victory.\nWe did survive, and if Hitler would see us now, he would turn in his grave, grave 100 times,\nbecause we did survive. He did not. And, we are just, just as good as anybody else, and I don't\nthink any people deserves what happened to us. It is an obligation to talk, and it should never\nhappen again ever.\nPeople have this saying that Jews went like sheep to the slaughter. How does that make you feel?\nThey did not have a choice. It was very systematic. It was...some did and some did not. There\nwere some people that were fighting. People, there was a Warsaw Ghetto uprising. There were\npeople fighting in the, in the woo--in the woods. There were Partisans, there were people in the\nUnderground. Most people did go like sheep. Unfortunately. They were very systematic about it.\nHow do you fight somebody with guns. How do you fight with bare hands against guns. I mean,\nthey were mighty. They stripped you of your dignity before they killed you. When you have no\ndignity, there is no life. They stripped you of whatever you believed in. You were nothing. There",
        "is...how can you fight this. The ones that did are very courageous. A lot did not survive. The\nones that did were very courageous. (Sigh) I don't know, um, I, I, I don't have the vocabulary to\nsum it up properly. Um, the only thing I know is history should never repeat itself. Not this\nhistory, for sure. And I hope there's more people like Mrs. Olefska, and Vishbitsky, and others that\nI don't know about. Because if it wouldn't be for them, I don't know who would survive.\nThanks. Thank you. Are we done? Room tone. Room tone?\nThe following is 30 seconds of room tone for interview with Stefa Kupfer.",
