        "Q: I guess what I'm trying to do is get a sense of how much information came into the\ntown. How well informed were people about the larger historical, you know, things that\nwere going on? The political developments that were going on? Were people afraid or\ndid it all seem very distant?",
        "A: No. My father went through World War I when he was a kid.",
        "Q: Uh huh?",
        "A: And so he was aware of the things of war. And I heard him speak to his friends about\nthe war. And the consensus among them was it's not going to last very long. Because\nthey were aware there were planes and, you know, kinds of things that they can use to\nreally to doa job on another country. So they were aware of things. And I heard them\nspeak and I was sort of aware what was going on myself.",
        "Q: So there was talk of war, but there was also a confidence that you could beat\nsomebody who invades your country?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: There was no confidence?",
        "A: There was never any confidence because within the government",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: the Polish government had some Germans in high office. And so they just they\nactually dismantled the air force before the war started.",
        "Q: So you're saying there was some sort of sabotage from within?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And since it was you know, the last place I lived which was\nSulmierzyce, they wehadseen you know, it was very close to the German border.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we were aware but not to the extent that they came in with, which the blasts and\nthe armament and whatnot was going on. So the war was wasn't going to last very long.\nNobody believed that it's going to last very long. Because the Poles didn't have enough\nof a force to fight them off.",
        "Q: I see. So it was in that sense that you that there was talk that they were coming and\nthey'll overrun us immediately? That sort of talk?",
        "A: Oh, yes. There was no doubt about it. And they did come in, and within a couple\ndays they were all occupied, the whole area.",
        "Q: Tell me the first time that you do you remember where you were when you learned\nthat the war had broken out?",
        "A: I was athome. Andit anda Polish Polish government called upon the people of\nage to come and join the military.",
        "Q: So there was an as announcement over the radio?",
        "A: There was an announcement. And so my father left",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A:tojoin notjoin. Hehadto hewasa_ inthe military before. It's been a couple\nyears. So, therefore, he was supposed to report to one of the military I would say where\nregister and they get you into the service.",
        "Q: One yeah.",
        "A: So he left. We didn't know where he was when the Germans came in. And my father\nfinally came home. I don't know how many how much time. I cannot remember the\ntime element it took for him to come back. He was _ told the story that he was captured\nby the Germans and they held him. And they were going to kill him and a whole bunch\nof people that they were going to kill. So they had my father had a gold Omega pocket\nwatch, which in those days was the style. And one of the German guards saw it. He\nsays, \"If you give me this, I'll let you go.\" So he gave him the watch and he really let him\ngo, and he came home.",
        "Q: I see. So it was for his breath.",
        "A: Right. Right. That was just the beginning.",
        "Q: And when was the first time you saw any did you see German soldiers soon after\nthat announcement came? When did you first have the war come to you?",
        "A: Within two days.",
        "Q: Okay. What happened?",
        "A: The Germans moved in and they started killing people. They rounded up the teachers,\nthe priests, the rabbis, you know, and they started killing them.",
        "Q: So this sounds like it was not based on whether you were Jewish or not but based\nmore if you were, like, a community leader. 'Cause a priest or a rabbi would be a\ncommunity leader.",
        "A: Right. The elite. The teachers, the doctors, the old the educated people.",
        "Q: Okay. And they were the ones who were being arrested and killed?",
        "A: Right, either killed or sent to Germany to work. I am not aware how many people\nthey killed, but I know they did.",
        "Q: Did you see anything did you see any violence on the streets?",
        "A: From time to time. The occupation was broadcast and we didn't go out on the street\nuntil they entrenched themselves within the city, within the town.",
        "Q: So you stayed at home. When you found out that the war was on, your mother and\nyour brother and your sister you stayed inside the house?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: And when did you first venture out?",
        "A: Right after. Right after a few days, we ventured out and _'cause we understood the\nlanguage.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: The German people the German soldiers did not know who was Jewish and who was\nnot.",
        "Q: They did not. Okay.",
        "A: They did not.",
        "Q: Were you similar you said you mother was very religious. But in your dress and in\nyour manners and so on, you were indistinguishable from anybody else?",
        "A: Right. Correct.",
        "Q: I see. Okay. And what is the first thing that you noticed that was different?",
        "A: The food. We didn't get much food. It was rationed. And the ruthlessness of the\nGerman occupiers. They'd just beat people up, beat kids up, beat grownups up and got\nthem to work or picked them up in the street and took them to work.",
        "Q: So in other words, I get the sense that there's really no fighting that actually happened;\nthat there was no fight that was put up in your area. They just ran in.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: They just overran the place?",
        "A: They just came in, and that was\u2019 that was it. They did not there was no fight. There\nwas not a soldier within miles. And",
        "Q: When you say they came in then, does that mean no soldiers were there? No\nWehrmacht was there or",
        "A: Oh, yes. The Wehrmacht came in, the SS right after that. You know, I didn't know\nwho was\u2019 an SS manis, but I did know what an Wehrmacht is.",
        "Q: Yeah. Uh huh. But no Polish soldiers?",
        "A: No. They were gone.",
        "Q: They were all gone. Yeah.",
        "A: 'Cause I never saw when the war started.",
        "Q: Yeah. So aside from aside from rationing and, you said, the ruthlessness of the\nGerman soldiers, how else did life change?",
        "A: You had to stay in line for to get a loaf of bread. Everything was in short supply.\nThere was no sugar, no nothing. You know, that whatever you had to do, you were\nrationed.",
        "Q: Was that across the board for everybody or was this particular targeted to the Jews?",
        "A: That, I don't know. I would imagine it was across the board.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "Q: Was there in those early days, was there any discrimination against the Jews that\nwas harsher or more different than, let's say, the Polish population?",
        "A: They didn't know _ they couldn't recognize one from the other unless they wear the\nreligious hair.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Otherwise they didn't know who the Jews were.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: They just didn't know. And so, like, myself, I was able to go anywhere even where\nthe soldiers were and, you know, it was okay. I was afraid, but I did go. You know, I did\nsee them, you know. I didn't go near any Army installation or any you know, anything\nlike that. I avoided that. But, however, you know, they didn't they didn't know who the\nJews were or what they looked like unless they saw somebody who was religious that\nthey wore the _ the garb, the hair, the face, you know, and so on.",
        "Q: Well, when you would go, you know, I take it out of, like, a child's curiosity to see\nwhat was\u2019 what are some of the things you saw?",
        "A: A lot of military around there. There was a lot of they established the SS\nheadquarters. They took over the police department.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: So they had special German police. They didn't have any Polish. They just disbanded\nthem. And right when I was about 1n fear because they were ruthless. If they got ahold\nof somebody who did something, they either killed them or beat the hell out of them.",
        "Q: Did you see things like that? Did you see people being beaten?",
        "A: Oh, yes, a lot. In fact, as we go, I have something I can tell you about myself, what\ntranspired.",
        "Q: Okay. We'll probably be there soon. Tell me, what happened with your mother and\nyour father? How did they start how did they continue to put food on the table? I take\nit your father, when he came back, didn't leave again because, where would he go?",
        "A: My father was gone for quite a while. We didn't know where he was.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But when he came back, he is_ he was an educated person.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He spoke German.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: Spoke clean Polish. He spoke a little bit between. He had knowledge of a lot of\nlanguages, you know; Russian, for instance. 'Cause his _ his father was a Russian\nteacher.",
        "Q: Uh huh. That's quite impressive",
        "A: Well",
        "Q: to know that many languages.",
        "A: Well, I was impressed with him, but I didn't like him, quite honestly.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. I got",
        "A: So about when he came back, he had to start providing things. He was able to go\namong the Germans, talk to them, establish a Jewish city hall.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Which he was one of the people that worked for them. He was a mediator between\nthe Germans and the Jewish community.",
        "Q: That's very responsible.",
        "A: Yes, it was responsible. And but, you know, I",
        "Q: Was he a harsh man?",
        "A: No, he wasn't. He wasn't. Only when I did something I shouldn't have done.",
        "Q: Was he distant then? Decent but distant?",
        "A: I would say I don't think he was instant. You know, I hugged him and, you know, he\nhugged me. You know, so but he was he was not a warm father, but he was not\ndistant.",
        "Q: I got that. Okay. So he became a mediator, you know, between the Germans and the\nJewish community.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And did I understand correctly that sometimes he would just perform some services\nfor the Germans and then he was able to put food on the table because of that?",
        "A: He was able to do things \u2014 the food was rationed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When we have a situation like we had, when you have rations, you have you have\nsometimes a preference if you know people.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So this was the kind of thing that he did. But he also bailed out people that were\narrested.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: He paid them off. He did a lot of things that was for the Jewish community. The\nJewish community apparently gave him things, you know, for the Germans that were\nwhat he needed to buy the person out for money or for other things. I don't know. For\ngold. Idon't I would imagine. But he was a mediator between the Germans and the\nJewish community \u2014 the Jewish city hall that they formed. And, of course, they had\npeople that they talked to and that decided what to do, how to do it.",
        "Q: So did he come home and talk about all of these things or did",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Never, huh?",
        "A: Never talked about anything. I never knew, but they do did know that he was a\nmediator because he used to bring home a lot of a suitcase for the money. And what\ndid he need money for? Only to buy out or to buy off a German, you know, for",
        "Q: For somebody.",
        "A: For",
        "Q: For somebody's life.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Uh huh. How long did you all live in this kind of situation? How long did this kind of\nlimbo situation last?",
        "A: It was probably about a year and a half, maybe two.",
        "Q: So were you in a ghetto or were you just",
        "A: This was before the ghetto the time they formed that ghetto.",
        "Q: So in other words, for a year and a half or almost two years",
        "A: No, not quite. Not two years. About a year, I would say.",
        "Q: Okay. So it would be from September '39 to September '40, one could say?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah. Something like that.",
        "Q: Something like that. Your you still lived in your own home. You were under this\nthis occupation regime.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: It was bad but there was no sense yet that the Jews are going to be targeted for some\nspecial special treatment in the negative sense? It was it was bad for everybody\u201d?",
        "A: We knew because there were a lot of killings taking place. There was a lot of stuff\nthat was going on. Being as young as I was, I wasn't aware of a lot of things. You have\nto remember, when the war started, I was 12 years old.",
        "Q: Yeah. Of course. Of course.",
        "A: AndI didn't I wasn't aware of no one person what was going on.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. It would be clues. It's from your child's memories that I'm trying to get\nthis picture of what things were like.",
        "A: Yeah. I understand.",
        "Q: Yeah. So did life stay the same, pretty much, until the ghetto was formed or were\nthere some incidents before it happened that",
        "A: There were some things before it happened. They took a lot of people out.",
        "Q: Tell me what those were.",
        "A: Well, they rounded up people.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they rounded up people and they just disappeared.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: And later on, we found out there were labor camps, after the war.",
        "Q: So how did they round them up? Did they block off streets or did they go by a list of\nnames? How did this happen?",
        "A: Well, they had names. The some of the Polish people were turned the Jews in,\nperiod.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So andthey rounded they rounded them up and they disappeared. And they were\nbrought back for instance, a couple Jewish Polish soldiers, and they killed them because\nthey did something that they didn't like. So they killed them so everybody can see or that\nmost people can see so that they wouldn't do it.",
        "Q: So these why like public executions?",
        "A: Sort of, yes. Sort of. But then then after about a year orso I'm not sure as to the\ntime, you know, that",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: at the place. They took a Polish two streets and took the Polish people out of there\nand put the Jewish in there. And then they had that 1s where the ghetto was formed.",
        "Q: And the ghetto was in the small town you were born and grew up in?",
        "A: In the small town, yes. Another part of town where I used to live or another a part of\nwhat is called, quote, downtown area.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. And so did you have to move into those two streets?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We had to move in. We had to have one room. We shared a place with\nanother family.",
        "Q: Was there indoor plumbing?",
        "A: You know, I do not recall that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The most people didn't have it. This was a newer house. I don't think so.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't think so. And they formed a ghetto.",
        "Q: Before they formed the ghetto, were you going to school or was school suspended?",
        "A: School was suspended for the Jewish kids.",
        "Q: Okay. And what about the Polish kids?",
        "A: The Polish kids had school, yes. They had schools for them.",
        "Q: Okay. So during the day, you just hung out at home?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: I mean, what where can you go?",
        "Q: Exactly.",
        "A: No place to go.",
        "Q: And your father was with you when you moved into the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was with us. And moved into one room. There was five of us.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: And we had a little kitchen, you know, a small little kitchen. But that was the extent\nof it.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: And so the ghetto, when they took out people, like myself I was, like, again, 12, 13\nyears old at that time. And they put me to work.",
        "Q: And what was\u2019 what did you have to do?",
        "A: My job was I was an electric welder.",
        "Q: An electric welder?",
        "A: Welder. They showed me how to do it and I was welding the wheelbarrows.",
        "Q: You were welding wheelbarrows?",
        "A: Right. So they they produced they have that iron now. They had the company\nthere and they hired they got the Jewish kids.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: Or the Jewish people, you know, that were working and producing them.",
        "Q: Well, did you get any kind of pay for this? Any kind of",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "Q: No. So this was _ this was forced labor?",
        "A: It was forced labor, absolutely.",
        "Q: And no food?",
        "A: They didn't give us any food. The food was from the house, whatever you could get.",
        "Q: Andno and no ability to say no?",
        "A: That's correct. Because if you refused, you weren't around very long.",
        "Q: Yeah. What kind of job did your father do? Was he continuing being a mediator?",
        "A: Yes. He was a mediator to the very end of the ghetto.",
        "Q: And what did your mother do?",
        "A: Not much. She tried to provide for us. She tried to keep us fed. Didn't do much.\nThere was no nothing that you can do. You were packed like herrings into a small area.",
        "Q: Did you\u2019 when you went to work in the morning, did you leave the ghetto area?",
        "A: They left we left when we left the ghetto area, we were under guards.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They had some Jewish what they call kapos or whatever and the Germans. They\nwalked with us to the place of work.",
        "Q: And the Jewish kapos are these people that you recognized and knew or were they\nstrangers?",
        "A: No; people that we knew. It wasn't that big of a town that we didn't know people, you\nknow, but yeah, we knew them.",
        "Q: And were they were they harsh? Were they",
        "A: No. They just you know, kids are kids everywhere. They tried to get out of line.",
        "Q: That's true.",
        "A: They put them back, you know. We didn't realize the enormity of this whole thing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So butI I don't know how to explain this. We used to go to work every morning\nand come home in the evening, and that was going on for quite a while. And a little bit at\nthe time, they took the Jews and shipped them out.",
        "Q: That's when the ghetto gets liquidated?",
        "A: Right, a little bit at a time.",
        "Q: A little bit at a time. Okay.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. But and was that something everybody noticed, that another group was gone\nand another group 1s gone?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. They what youcall they rounded up all the Jews.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: And they picked out whoever they wanted to pick out to send to the gas chambers or\nprison camps or such, you know.",
        "Q: And, again, how was this done when it was a little bit at a time? Was it by a list or\nwas it you were called to a square and then they would say every tenth person? How did\nthose people who get rounded up",
        "A: You were called to a square. Everybody had to appear. And they picked out I don't\nknow how they went about picking out picking out people. I have no idea. And but\nthey did. Families _ let's say, mother and father or mother and the kids, and I don't\nknow how they went about doing it. And my father occasionally was able to get\nsomebody back from what they picked out by buying them off.",
        "Q: I see. Were there more people who were doing the same thing as your father was\ndoing as a mediator?",
        "A: Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge. At least I didn't know any.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you told me earlier that there was a story you had to tell me. It\nwas when I was asking about did you see people being beaten up, did you see people\nyou know, violence in the streets. And can you tell me what what happened?",
        "A: There was violence. There was a German population that they moved in and they\nused to beat up the Jewish kids or the Jewish people.",
        "Q: So it was civilians who would do this, not just Army?",
        "A: Civilians and occasionally they had the SS going through there. And, you know, they\npicked up people. They you know, I cannot explain they used to beat them up, and\nsometimes they picked them up and killed them.",
        "Q: Did you see corpses in the streets?",
        "A: Not at the time that I was in the ghetto. I saw corpses from starvation. Occasionally,\nyes, I did see, but not many.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: They didn't do it in public view, so to speak.",
        "Q: Except for those two Polish Jewish soldiers.",
        "A: Two Polish Jewish soldiers; brought them in because they called the German soldier\nand I don't know what happened. And they brought them in.\nIt was a Jewish restaurant before the ghetto. And they used to the Jewish people used\nto go there to this what they call a restaurant. And they brought in this Jewish Polish\nsoldier that he was imprisoned. He was a POW. They brought him in to explain what\nhappened, what he did. And that was the end of him. After that, we didn't hear of him\nanymore.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: So logically speaking, knowing what I know, he didn't make it.",
        "Q: Okay. So but you didn't see this public execution?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Remember, you said that there were a couple who were executed publicly. So",
        "A: I saw that.",
        "Q: You saw it?",
        "A: Yes. But I saw within the town. And they did something, and I don't know what they\ndid. And they just shot them.",
        "Q: Yeah. That's an awful lot of violence for a 13 year old to see.",
        "A: Hm, yeah. It was a bad time.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Did you yourself ever get beat up?",
        "A: No, not really. You know, I got hit a couple times across my back. But that's about it,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Okay. Were there I remember in the interview that we did in Los Angeles, you\nknow, where where we were only able to speak with you for a short amount of time",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: you did mention something about the son of the German police chief.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: What was that about?",
        "A: Well, we only were allowed to walk on one side of the street.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The other side was for Aryans only. So here this kid you know, being a kid, again, I\nwent to the other side of the street.",
        "Q: The wrong side.",
        "A: The wrong side, the one that I'm not supposed to. But I also wore a (inaudible) with\n\"Jew\" on it.",
        "Q: Oh, you wore the yellow star?",
        "A: Yellow star.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So this kid came and pushed me off and I pushed him back. And we started hitting\neach other. Then he started running. I cornered him, kind of beat him up a little bit.\nAnd next thing I knew, the I found out later he belonged to the police officers police\ncaptain or something and they were looking for me.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",

        "A: For a while, they used to call the people intoa intoaplace anopen place. All the\nJewish people came. They picked up some Jewish people and they just took them away.\nThat was the end of them; never heard from them again. The they didus they did this\nquite a few times.

        "Q: So you knew\u2019 where were they going?",
        "A: To Auschwitz.",

Well, they took they closed up the ghetto, period, and they shipped the Jews\nout. Well, then we were left father and mother, these other people, and a son. The\ndaughters the one one ofthe daughters one daughter was already in prison. And our\nfamily, which was myself, my mother, my sister, my brother, and my grandmother,\nwhich was my father's mother.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: And we waited a day or so. The ghetto was gone. They took everybody.",
        "Q: This place where you were waiting and hiding it was outside the ghetto?",
        "A: Outside the ghetto; a Polish guy that had a Jewish girlfriend.",
        "Q: Okay. And so it wasn't far away from the ghetto, or it was far away?",

        "Q: I'm here, but I'm kind of shocked. So he kind of abandoned his family?",
        "A: So to speak, yes. And because he knew the end result. He really did.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He didn't talk. He knew what was going on. So the question was: What do we do?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: 13 years old. And there was a man with his son and his wife ask me. I says, you\nknow, I'm 13 years old. I don't know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I said, you know, in my opinion, if we turn ourselves in we have absolutely no place\nto go. If we wait days, they catch us, they kill us. There's no there was no question\nabout that.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: I says, if we turn ourselves in, some of us have a chance to survive.",

        "A: But nothing was said.",
        "Q: So, tell me, was it the same camp commandants the entire time or was there a change?",
        "A: You know, I really don't know. I could not, I could not tell you, really, whether it was\nthe same commandant or not but he was -- I know afterwards -- you know, there were\nalso women which was used by the SS, by the military there.",
        "Q: I was going ask you --",
        "A: There was women.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you were there any women in the camp.",
        "A: Yes, Jewish women. Their husbands were prisoners. And they used them for their\nown use.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: And so they -- we were there about, I guess, maybe a year, maybe not, the SS took\nover. And they came in and gave us concentration camp clothing. And they put numbers\non US.",
        "Q: So you were tattooed?",
        "A: I was tattooed, yes.",
        "Q: What's your number?",
        "A: 178212.",
        "Q: 178212.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did that mean that there were -- you were -- there were at least 17,212 prisoners?",
        "A: Probably. I don't, I really don't know. I could not account for anything, you know.\nReally, I can only tell you what I saw and what transpired there.",
        "Q: Were the women ever used for anything else? I mean, did they ever have actual jobs\nor was it they --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- they were prostituted?",
        "A: They were prostituted. That's -- I wouldn't -- I didn't want to use that term.",
        "Q: I know, I know. But it --",
        "A: They had husbands there. That's the irony of it.",
        "Q: Well, it's a tragedy and a catastrophe all the way around.",
        "A: Right. Then they gave us the concentration camp clothing and I was tattooed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And we were part of Auschwitz, became part of Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Oh, really? So then you became one of the subcamps of Auschwitz.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And so you -- did your treatment change? Did the food change?",
        "A: The food was the same. There were -- only thing, you know, they used to -- they got\npeople, the prisoners, to play music as we marched out and as we came in.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: You know, there was people that were -- you know, they had people, like Jews from\nHolland, Jews from France.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Jews from just about everywhere. The Polish Jews were, I think, the predominant,\nyou know, people, so. But --",
        "Q: Do you remember the kind of music they were forced to play?",
        "A: March music.",
        "Q: Marching music.",
        "A: Yes. And, you know --",
        "Q: Was there anybody, in addition to that old guard, was there anybody who behaved in a\nmore humane way towards the prisoners amongst the guards or the, you know, the army\nor even the SS or were they all pretty brutal?",
        "A: I wouldn't say -- only if they think you committed a crime.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Like smoking.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Like stealing. Things, you know, of that nature.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They put you up on the gallows so everybody can watch. And we watched quite a bit\nof that.",
        "Q: Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear.",
        "A: Can you hear me?",
        "Q: I can hear you. I can hear you. Again, but I'm just speechless because I'm trying to\nimagine a young kid -- I mean, for anybody this would be, this would be horrifying but\nparticularly for young teenage boys, you know, young teenagers.",
        "A: There was no ;",
        "Q: Excuse me?",
        "A: They took us out. We had to watch while they do it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were beaten up by them but it's something -- I don't know what I did. I don't\nremember. I was hit a couple times, you know. They hit me over the back, over my rear\nend, you know, and --",
        "Q: And your brother too?",
        "A: My brother, basically, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was with me. I tried to protect him the best I could. And I did, you know. I\ncouldn't do much for him, you know, except we kind of were very close together. He -- I\nslept in the middle bunk and he slept in the down bunk.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. On the bottom bunk.",
        "A: The bottom bunk. And the third person, I don't remember who it was. You know,\nyou, you were only fighting for your own life, so, you know.",
        "Q: Did he do the same work that you did?",
        "A: Yes. He was a year younger than me. And he was very skinny. He was a little guy,\nperiod.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I had people from my hometown, you know, kids like myself from my\nhometown. Three sets of brothers, in fact, that survived.",
        "Q: Three sets of brothers.",
        "A: Three set of brothers.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Myself and my brother. Another couple, which they -- I don't know whether they're\nstill alive. They were their friends. We had another set of brothers that were very close\nto the -- one of the brothers was a . He was very close friends with Elie\nWiesel.",
        "Q: I see. And you were in that camp.",
        "A: Yes. He was a scientist who worked for Brooklyn -- the naval yard and died of\ncancer.",
        "Q: So you kept in touch with them after the war.",
        "A: Yes. In a roundabout way, yes, yes. Elie Wiesel I haven't seen for -- since we got\nhere. Since we left Europe, in fact.",
        "Q: But was he in this camp with you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I met him in Buchenwald.",
        "Q: So were you transferred at some point?",
        "A: Yes, we were transferred. Let me, let me back up a little bit.",
        "Q: Yeah, let's go back to the story.",
        "A: Continue the story.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were taken out and the Russian army came close.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were taken out and -- to walk. So we started walking. We slept outdoors. And\nthis was, mind you, during the winter season and it was snowing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We kept walking. Probably half the people didn't make it. Either froze to death or\ndidn't take care of sufficiently. I did the best I could. I washed myself with snow. I told\nmy brother to do the same because you get your blood going. And the walk, we walked\nand walked for probably a couple weeks, maybe more.",
        "Q: My goodness.",
        "A: Time was not of essence.",
        "Q: Yeah, of course.",
        "A: We tried, you know, we tried to run into the homes. We slept in barns. From time to\ntime -- we finally, after two, three weeks, we got to a place called Gross-Rosen.",
        "Q: Gross-Rosen, okay.",
        "A: It was sort of, I think, a death camp. They packed us in in barracks. And, I mean, we\nwere packed. The place was filling up almost. And I didn't think we were going to make\nit from there. But they took us from there. We were there about a week or two weeks.\nAgain, time wasn't --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- important anyhow. And they took us and packed us on open freight trains to Gross-\nRosen. Now, come to find out, after the war when I went back with Lisa, that it -- they\nproduced marble in that area. They were digging for marble. And the place was\nsurrounded but you -- the people outside could not look in. No access to it. So nobody\nknew what was going on in that prison camp.\nThey took us. Anyhow, they put us on freight trains.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they transported us to Weimar.",
        "Q: Right. And Buchenwald is really close to Weimar.",
        "A: Buchenwald is very close to Weimar. Well, lo and behold, there were air raids. And\nunfortunately, the U.S. Army didn't know, they of course didn't know who was down\nthere and they bombed that train --",
        "Q: Oh. My goodness.",
        "A: -- unfortunately. Anyhow, a lot of people passed at that time. And then they took us\ninto Weimar to Buchenwald.",
        "Q: So those that survived were taken to Buchenwald.",
        "A: Buchenwald, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we were with kids, with other kids.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We had two or three barracks or four barracks. I don't -- I'm not -- don't remember\nwhich, you know. And we were on the, I guess on the famous barracks, 66.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. What makes them famous?",
        "A: I don't know. I think everybody that I heard about, they were talking about barracks\n66.",
        "Q: Huh. Okay.",
        "A: older kids. Maybe that was the reason.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And anyhow, they gave us a little bit of soup a day and they took us from\nout, to march us out. Then put us back. We were supposed to go down for a while. And\nI got so sick that I really begged them to take me away. I had, unfortunately, diarrhea so\nbad --",
        "Q: Oh, dear.",
        "A: -- I could no longer take it.",
        "Q: Oh, dear.",
        "A: So they took me into a -- I'm shaky. They took me into a barrack with a lot of, a lot of\nkids. I think -- what I saw was mostly kids.",
        "Q: Was it an infirmary or what should have been an infirmary?",
        "A: It was barracks set up for that purpose. I don't know -- I can tell you one thing. They\ntook so many people out every day and they didn't come back.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodnesses.",
        "A: After the war, I found out they were giving them -- they were killing them by giving\nthem an injection.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Now, what happened to me is I kind of lucked out. There was a man that came up to\nme that was working there. Whether he was Jewish or not, I don't know. Whether he\nwas a doctor, I don't know. So he came, of all the kids, he came up to me and he said,\n\"How old are you?\" I said, \"Sixteen.\" He says, \"You have a long life ahead of you. Let\nme see what I can do for you.\"",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. So what did he do?",
        "A: Well, let me get my composure. I'm just, I'm choking.",
        "Q: Shall we pause for a little bit?",
        "A: Please.",
        "Q: Okay. I'm going to pause.",
        "A: Just take a few minutes.",
        "Q: Okay. I'll pause.\n(Pause)",
        "Q: Okay. This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mr. Jacques Ribons. Okay. I'm back. So he came -- I was asking you,\nwhat did this man do to help save you?",
        "A: I don't remember if he was a doctor or not. But anyhow, he says, \"I'm going to see\nwhat I can do for you.\"",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He said, \"Let me take your stool.\"",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which he took my stool and he took it. Wherever he took it, I don't know. He came\nback a few days later, which I was lucky they didn't put me into that room where --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He says, \"I think I can help you.\" So he took me out and put me on a two-wheel\ntransportation thing, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Like a wheelbarrow. And he took me out. They took me to a hospital. I guess --\nthere were beds there, bunks, and things like that.",
        "Q: Within Buchenwald?",
        "A: It was in Buchenwald.",
        "Q: It was --",
        "A: They had other prisoners there, international prisoners.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So they used these hospital primarily for non-Jews, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Occasionally they did have, like myself, they took me in there.\nIn comes a guy with an injection. It looked to me like it was a foot long. He gave me an\ninjection. He says, \"That will make you feel better.\" And they started giving me, I forgot\nwhat they call this, like a very plain cereal that you cook.",
        "Q: Oh. Could it have been, like, farina or cream of wheat? I mean, whatever --",
        "A: Cream of wheat.",
        "Q:-- the generic name would be?",
        "A: Cream of -- this is what they fed me.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I gained a little weight. And I got news out to my brother, my brother was in the\nbarracks, 66, to see whether he can come. And I gave him some food. And they put me\nback, sort of, together.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. How long did you stay there in that room with those --",
        "A: I couldn't even tell you.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know. When I got a little better, they sent me back to the barracks. And by\nthat time, the closing of the war was just about beginning.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we were there, I don't know how long I was still there, and the war was coming to\nan end.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: All of a sudden -- we used to hear the artillery from far away. It was -- I forgot the\nword for this. Erfurt. It was called Erfurt, the town.",
        "Q: Erfurt is a town, yes, a small city.",
        "A: Erfurt, we used to hear the artillery. They were firing across to Weimar.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "A: And so we used to hear the cannons. And all of a sudden, we had a plane that came\nin, a tank that came in with U.S. soldiers. This was quite a while later. And they took\nout people. They took them out and never heard from them again.",
        "Q: So this is a tank, a German tank.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This is a U.S. tank?",
        "A: No, it was -- yeah, it was made in the -- I was there for quite a while longer.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then when the war was coming to an end, they broke through the lines, I suppose,\nfrom Erfurt --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- the U.S. military, the Third Army moved up and took over Weimar and they came\nin to us.",
        "Q: So, in other words, the Americans liberated you in Buchenwald.",
        "A: The Americans liberated us in Buchenwald, yes. But it took -- it's a longer story than\nthat because they used to take out people out of the prison camp, either kill them or get\nrid of them. I don't know what they did with them.",
        "Q: When you're talking about they took them out, who took them out?",
        "A: The Germans took them out.",
        "Q: That's what I thought. Okay. So the Germans --",
        "A: Before the U.S. came, the U.S. Army.",
        "Q: Before they came.",
        "A: Before they came.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: They took out, in fact, one of them, a person, my hometown, their father they took out.\nBut he was . For some reason or another, they kept the kids intact. The\nprisoners themselves were political prisoners, a lot of them. They made sure that these\nkids, these Jewish kids, that they kept in barracks 66, 64, 65 got maintained.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They took, they sort of took care of them. I found out later. I didn't know that. And\nso the U.S. Army moved in and here we were.",
        "Q: What was that like? My God, three, almost three years then that you had been in the\ncamp system, that you had been under such conditions. And all of a sudden, these GIs\nappear.",
        "A: The Gls, yeah. Let me just --",
        "Q: We can stop. Hang on.",
        "A: Okay.\n(Pause)",
        "Q: Okay. They came in.",
        "A: They came in. There were mostly Jewish kids. And I understand, from what I heard\nand what I saw, was some non-Jewish kids too among the Jewish kids.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And they took over. They fed us. Put us, really, back together to help and the really,\nwhoever with tuberculosis, with TB --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- was sent to Switzerland, to Sweden, to Germany into the mountains. And they took\na group of kids that the French government okayed it and they took us to France.",
        "Q: So you went to France?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: With your brother?",
        "A: One brother and -- there was about three sets of brothers the same way.",
        "Q: Who also went to France.",
        "A: . Yes.",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: They took us by train.",
        "Q: They took you by train.",
        "A: Yeah. When the U.S. Army moved in, they had a rabbi that came over and took the\nJewish kids. And some of them were non-Jewish. And they had a segment of the kids\nthat they sent to France, they sent them to Switzerland, to England. You know,\nwhichever country took them in.",
        "Q: Okay. So you end up in France.",
        "A: I end up in France.",
        "Q: Before we go to France, what was in France, tell me, when you were in Buchenwald\nand right before the Americans come, what happened with the German guards and the\nGerman authorities?",
        "A: Well, the German authority were -- for instance, you know, I was sick. I came out of\nthe hospital and I was laying there on one of the bunks, so to speak, like a shelf.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there was a window and glass and I used to, I watched the main road. All ofa\nsudden I saw tanks moving up in that glass. It was like a mirror reflection in the glass.\nAnd I knew the U.S. Army is moving in. So when they came in, they took the kids. And\nthe rabbis, the priests, they gave them, you know --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- food. They gave them medicine. And some of them had to be hospitalized and they\nbrought us back sort of together.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And, you know, back to health, so to speak. And they sorted out kids to go to France,\nit had to do with their health also, to England, and to some other countries, you know,\nthat they -- I don't know all the countries that the kids went to, so.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But they spread them out. Each country took in so many kids, you know.",
        "Q: But I was backing up to ask you what had happened to all of the German guards. Did\nthey disappear? Were they arrested? Did they run away\u201d?",
        "A: The Germans had jumped off the towers --",
        "Q: Pardon?",
        "A: -- during that because -- the guard towers.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And they started running.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: If the GIs came up on one of them, they killed them, you know.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: They were running away from the prison, period. And I guess, I don't know who they\ncaught, the main commandant was caught by the U.S. Army. The main people that were\ncaught, the same thing. They had sort of a mini revolution within that prison because\nthere were a lot of Germans that worked 1n that prison also that were there for many\nyears.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Germans that were not Nazis.",
        "Q: That's right. Political prisoners. There were a lot of political prisoners.",
        "A: Political prisoners that were put in there.",
        "Q: Yeah. And so --",
        "A: But they're the ones primarily that run that prison.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did --",
        "A: Had access to armament. There was a munition factory --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and an armament factory in one of the prisons down the road. And they had a man\nover there that worked in that prison, the munition factory. And one of them\nwas Leon Blum.",
        "Q: Really? Well, I --",
        "A: I don't know whether he survived or not.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But he was one of the people that was in that. But prison, the armament.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the U.S. Air Force bombed it. And after that, I don't know what happened to the\npeople.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. So you end up in Paris. I mean, excuse me, in France. Was it Paris or\nwas it somewhere else?",
        "A: Yeah, they dispersed all the kids.",
        "Q: Excuse me?",
        "A: They dispersed the kids.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Some of them went into ;",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Others went into a religious home. They had -- they divided them, you know, in\ndifferent homes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then they had, I want to say they had homes for the French kids also there. So they\nput them together.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "A: Jewish kids that had, you know, that survived the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The French kids. One of my friends -- and the OSE took over. I don't know whether\nyou're familiar with the OSE.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about it. What is it?",
        "A: OSE was an organization that was from, I guess -- a French organization which took\ncare of the kids to make sure they go to school and some of them had trades and they paid\nfor the education.",
        "Q: Was it a government organization?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Was it a Jewish organization?",
        "A: It was a Jewish organization.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Primarily Jewish. I don't know whether it was totally Jewish. It was like --",
        "Q: How do you spell the acronym?",
        "A: I don't know. It was initials O-S-E.",
        "Q: O-S-E, okay. Okay. OSE. And --",
        "A: They sent a friend of mine to school. He came to the United States and became a\nmillionaire.",
        "Q: Wow. And what about you? When you got off the train, what kind of a place were\nyou --",
        "A: I went into a Jewish religious situation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Even though I wasn't religious, I went into that home.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know. I don't know what I was thinking. And I started going to school a little\nbit and then I returned to the United States in 1947.",
        "Q: So you were in France for, let's say, almost two years?",
        "A: Almost.",
        "Q: Did you learn --",
        "A: I would say a year and a half. April, in April, to be specific, April the 11th was my\nfreedom day in Buchenwald.",
        "Q: Well, those kind of dates you don't forget.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: April 11th was freedom. And was your brother with you?",
        "A: My brother was with me and there were other two sets of brothers, one of the brothers\nof the father that they took out and disappeared.",
        "Q: That's right. That's right. So did your brother go with you to France as well?",
        "A: Yes, yes. He was with me all along.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was with me --",
        "Q: Same school, same everything?",

        "Q: Well, but it's such a huge change, where one month you were a prisoner in a\nconcentration camp and month and a half later you're in a home in France and the\nfollowing September you go to school.",
        "A: It wasn't just like that. First of all, I don't know the time --",

        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: -- that checked us over. And they placed us in sort of a vacation home in the country,\nwhich was also one of the Rothschilds' homes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Excuse me. And so we were there for a while. The time element, I just don't, couldn't\ntell you.",
        "Q: Okay. That's okay.",
        "A: Then we went back to Versailles. We went to Versailles, rather, back -- the first time.\nWe went to Versailles. And then they sent us to school, to public school. Some of them\nhad families, they found families in the U.S. Some of them found each other. We had\nFrench kids also for a while but very few of them, what we did have.",
        "Q: Well, in 1945 -- you say your birthday is in August. So in 1945 you turned 18 years\nold, right?",

        "A: So I just let it go. I didn't want to change it. I changed the name but I didn't change\nthe date. It was a couple months. It didn't matter.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So officially you were born --",

        "A: Botany 500.",
        "Q: Botany 500?",
        "A: Yes. They went out of business now.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "Q: That's okay. Do you want to take a pause?",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So what happened after that?",
        "A: Well, he didn't have money. He was a very poor man but had a soul. But he -- I don't\nknow where he went. I understand he went to the people that make matzo. And they\nsupposedly had signed papers for me and my brother. And the thing was, you know, we\ncommunicated at that time in Yiddish.",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- made sure that everything goes smooth. We went to the American consulate, x-ray\ntaken, so on and so forth. And we got immigration papers. For whatever reason, they\nsaid that we have to hurry up and be in Sweden by such and such a date --",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "A: That ship was a troop ship during the war. That I know. In fact, I have probably a\npicture of it too.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "Q: There are a couple of them that were pretty famous but the names slips my mind as\nwell. One of the first ships out of Europe was used for military purposes. Anyway, was\nit a --",

        "A: Yeah. So in Gothenburg, we boarded the ship to the U.S. And I don't know how\nmany days it took. I don't remember. And believe it or not, we wound up in New York\nCity. The ship pulled up to dock. And it docked. And my uncle was supposed to come\nto getus. Well, he couldn't. We got off the ship. We don't have -- we have just clothes\nwhat we had on. We thought, well, when we get to the U.S., we'll buy new clothing.",

        "A: No. No, no. He went afterwards, after I came here.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: here. So the war was over and independence was in the works.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he joined the army. He didn't tell me where he was and I didn't tell him where I\nwent, you know, because I didn't want him to worry.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He comes back to register with the drafts. But anyhow, I registered with the drafts\nboard in New Jersey. I had to follow up here to register. And I got a notice, a drafts\nnotice. Well, again, I was going to school and I had to break the school and I was drafted\ninto the service, in the army.",
        "Q: And did you fight in the Korean War?",
        "A: I -- no, I wasn't directly involved in the fight because I was the guy behind the lines\nwith the artillery.",

        "A: Lisa is second in line.",
        "Q: So she's the second oldest.",
        "A: The second oldest.",
        "Q: How many girls and how many boys?",
        "A: One boy and three girls.",
        "Q: Okay. One boy, three girls?",
        "A: The irony of this, I don't know whether you know anything about Lisa --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- Lisa was a baby. She contracted spinal meningitis.",
        "Q: Oh, dear.",
        "A: And almost died.",
        "Q: Oh, dear.",
        "A: She went to the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. Because it's a contagious disease.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And she came back, although it affected her hearing. And she had a hard time to go to\nschool, go to high school.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I used to go to the high school and talk to the teacher and I got so angry, I was\ngoing to kill her. She was ,",
        "Q: We should probably -- hang on just a second. I want to pause for a minute.",
        "A: Sure.\n(Pause)",
        "Q: Okay. So you were -- you had quite an odyssey. You, you know, at age 12, not even\n12, you experience war and by the time you were 18, you have been through a forced\nlabor camp. You've lost your mother, your sister, your father. You have only your\nbrother. And you'd been through two concentration camps and through hell. And you\nend up in Los Angeles, where you marry and have four children. Tell me, when did you\nstart talking about what you had gone through? Did you tell your kids when they were\ngrowing up --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- about what your experiences were?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or did you keep it from them?",
        "A: Well, one of the reasons, you know ,",
        "Q: You know, it's the muffled voice again. Can we --",
        "A: When somebody loves somebody --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you don't want to -- you don't want them to know your agony, your past.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, you kind of protect them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I never talked about tt.",
        "Q: You didn't -- did you tell your ex-wife?",
        "A: No. My ex-wife, you know --",
        "Q: No. Okay.",
        "A: They had meetings, kids, you know, people from Europe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, we had gatherings or whatever; she would never go to any of those.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. I see. So in other words, there wasn't any interest on that part and so your\nchildren, you wanted to protect them from this --",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes. You know, I didn't want them to know the agony I had been through.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did that change at some point?",
        "A: Yes, it did.",
        "Q: When did it change?",
        "A: Well, I was prompted by Lisa, by the kids --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- to tell my story, to let people know --",
        "Q: And when did you start doing that?",
        "A: -- about you. You know, we didn't know about you. So all of a sudden they had\ninterest in me and my life and my past. Before that, you know, nobody ever -- I never\ntalked about it. They know that -- where I came from.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we never talked about anything.",
        "Q: Were they already grown up when they started asking questions?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were already grown up.",
        "Q: Do you have grandchildren?",
        "A: In fact, yes, I do, quite a few of them.",
        "Q: Are the grandchildren interested?",
        "A: They are. They are. But, you see, I have -- my wife wound up marrying somebody\nwho's not Jewish.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.",
        "A: My kids, for the most part, they're not Jewish.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So I don't have -- you know, what I mean? It's --",
        "Q: That's right. It's not, it's not --",
        "A: It's sort of --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- a different situation here. Who are you going to talk to.",
        "Q: When your brother was still alive, did you talk to him about the past, because you both\nhad been through it together, or did you not talk about it?",
        "A: Well, we talked very little about 1t because we both went through the same thing so,\nyou know, there was really not a lot to talk about.",
        "Q: You both knew it.",
        "A: You know, we just kept it in. And my brother in particular, he wouldn't talk about\nanything, you see.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I finally started talking and, you know, and started telling and -- but he didn't. He\ndidn't want to.",
        "Q: Tell me, when you did start talking and telling, did it change you?",
        "A: Change me?",
        "Q: I'm asking, did it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did it change your relationship with your kids?",
        "A: No, it didn't change. They have sympathy or -- what is the other word. I don't\nremember the word but they have, they were sympathetic to what I went through. They\nwanted to know more about it when they got older.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And, well, when you go through, I guess, a marriage, I wound up broke after so many\nyears --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- what do you do. I couldn't take them where I wanted to take them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So Lisa suggested let's do this and this and this. And I did.",
        "Q: So you went back with Lisa?",
        "A: I went back with Lisa one time, Lisa and my son. Then I went back another time to\nPoland. It was my granddaughter -- no, grandson, rather, and my son and Lisa and I.",
        "Q: And what kind of -- you know, did you go back to your hometown?",
        "A: I went back to my hometown. I showed them where I lived. It's so often that the\nnight was -- we got there late in the afternoon. I couldn't show them the main town. We\nshowed them the area where the ghetto was was still fenced up, sort of. And I guess -- I\ndon't think anybody's living there now --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- after so many years. And so we went through the killing camps. The first one,\nwhich was Blechhammer, Gross-Rosen, and Buchenwald. So there was not -- you go\nthrough this and you really don't see what really happened.",
        "Q: No, it's so many years later but nevertheless, it's the same -- it is back 1n the area, back\nin the places where it all happened.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: And I can't imagine that it wouldn't have made an impression on them, that 1t wouldn't\nhave had great meaning for them.",
        "A: It did make an impression, mostly Lisa.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: My son, I don't really know whether it made that much of an impression.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, what about you? When you went back, was it like it was in your\nmemory\u201d? What kind of impression did you have of your hometown?",
        "A: My hometown, if I could have disappeared when I was a baby, I would have.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That's how I felt about my hometown, so.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But there was nothing there, you know.",
        "Q: Have you spoken at schools?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Have you spoken in classrooms to young kids?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. Or to teenagers? Or has it been mostly when you talk now, it's been to your own\nfamily members?",
        "A: To my own family members. You know, there's another situation, that some people\nthat project themselves, that did well --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- [happen to know one or two, that did well financially and they try to project\nthemselves as the people that it happened to. So they want to write a book and they want\nto do this, they want to do that. And everybody else 1s left behind. So they do that and\nthey come in the forefront of all this.",
        "Q: Yeah. That's right.",
        "A: And they went to schools right here in --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, and teach in schools, you know . Unfortunately, the way I\nsee it, some of these people that go to the school and teaching of what happened --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- don't tell them the whole story. They make up some of the stuff.",
        "Q: There's always a danger that that can be, you know. Sometimes people remember\nthings differently but --",
        "A: You remember things differently but also this guy, this person is in the forefront.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He wrote a book. He's pushing himself. Like he went to see the governor and",
        "Q: I think I know what you're saying, is that you found that a little bit distasteful.",
        "A: Pushing themselves out in front.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you're kind of left behind if you're a little reserved, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so people call him. You know, they know that, so. I don't know. I just --",
        "Q: Have you ever, have you ever given an interview to a newspaper before?",
        "A: Yes, I did. In fact, there was a man here that was in the newspaper business -- not in\nthe newspaper business. He worked for the newspaper.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He worked for the newspaper.",
        "Q: He was a reporter.",
        "A: He came to me and asked me because what happened in Buchenwald itself --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- [have seen -- first, if you're a kid, you move around.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They have a, they had a -- I don't know how you say it in English.",
        "Q: In Dutch, Dutch?",
        "A: They have a quarry, rather --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- that they were getting stones. I don't know for what purpose. Probably for making\ncement or whatever. And they buried artifacts. And what I mean, artifacts, what I have\nseen is primarily jewelry, cases and cases and cases of jewelry that, military trucks that\ndrove up and they loaded all that stuff up and . And they had GIs with\nmachine guns guarding all this.",
        "Q: And this would be at Buchenwald?",
        "A: At Buchenwald. And I told him the story. And he was going to write. And his bosses\nsaid you can't do that because you'd be accusing the government. It disappeared.\nNobody knows where it's at. It disappeared. What that was . Nobody knows\nwhy. And, you know, he says do you have any witnesses. Yeah. I called up. They\nprobably have their story too, you know, the Kaleckshtaund (phonetic) in New York.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We had one in France, a couple brothers from my hometown with me.\nThey witnessed that. They told them. There are a couple of other people that I met that\nwere there at the same time I was, you know. And that didn't do it. He says the\ngovernment would be accused of what.",
        "Q: Well, it could be that it was sold -- either they gave -- either they transported that\njewelry and gave it up to the government or the soldiers themselves just took it.",
        "A: I got to tell you, people went over there after they left and they found all kinds of stuff\nburied in the ground because they stepped on it.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: Whole cases opened.",
        "Q: So you're saying jewelry that was buried in the ground on the site of Buchenwald.",
        "A: On the site of Buchenwald in the quarry.",
        "Q: Yeah, in the quarry.",
        "A: And knowing what I knew after the war --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- what they did is they took five prisoners or ten prisoners to dig these tunnels, you\nknow, to bury that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then they shot them.",
        "Q: You're talking about the Germans who did this before the war.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I mean before the war ended.",
        "A: Before the war ended. During the war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were still prisoners. They dug these tunnels and they killed them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So there would be no witnesses. The guards who came forward and said, told the\nstory was a German --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- that -- who saw what happened. So they started digging and they found all this.\nAnd the little reporter, he didn't want to write it because you're accusing the government\nof hiding things or stealing things. He says you can't do that.",
        "Q: So this was the interview that you gave to a newspaper man.",
        "A: The newspaper man.",
        "Q: Yeah. And it never went anywhere.",
        "A: Never went anywhere. So --",
        "Q: Well, I'm grateful that you have spoken with us today, you know, that you have\nwanted to get your story recorded by the Holocaust Museum here in Washington, D.C.\nWe're very, very appreciative that you've done it.",
        "A: You know, I tell you, my mother was an angel.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And my mother, when she said that, I have never forgotten what she said to me.",
        "Q: Yeah. Those were amazing words, an amazing, and an amazing sacrifice.",
        "A: And she said to me, go save yourself. Then I tell her I can die alone.",
        "Q: Yeah. I'm glad that you shared that. And I'm glad that other people will be able to\nhear that and know that about her when they'll be able to listen to your story.",
        "A: I'm very appreciative.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would want to add to what we've talked about today?",
        "A: I don't know what to think of. Well --",
        "Q: You know, in one interview, you can never catch -- you can never get everything.",
        "A: You can't.",
        "Q: It's just like that in life. It's how -- we've talked for a couple of hours now but, you\nknow, we're talking about your whole life so how can you put all that in a few hours.",
        "A: Well, you know, I'm going to add a few things.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't know whether you can put it in perspective or not. But, you know, they used to\ntake people and hang them to teach the people a lesson. If you do this, the same thing is\ngoing to happen. And people started making noises. So they had machine guns in the\ntowers and they started firing, you know.",
        "Q: You mean the dying people make noises.",
        "A: Not the dying people. The dying people were hanging. They couldn't make noises.\nThey were just swinging. But they just, they had guards on the towers --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- that the prisoners started making noises, anything at all, some movement, they fired\nright in the crowd, into the prisoners.",
        "Q: Wow. Wow. So you couldn't even show that you were upset.",
        "A: Oh, of course not. You know, they took you out and they did what they call",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you had to watch it, you know, the hanging, you know. You just couldn't stay in\nthe barracks. You had to watch the whole episode. And this 15-year-old kid that worked\nwith me and smoked cigarettes and they caught him doing it, even though I did also, he\nwouldn't tell them that and they hung him.",
        "Q: Oh, my God.",
        "A: A French kid.",
        "Q: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And there but for the grace of God it could have been you\nbecause you smoked as well.",
        "A: Right. And, you know, nearby there was some English prisoners of war. And we\nused to encounter them when we walked to work. You know, sometimes we walked the\nopposite direction.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: And, anyways, in that place --",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: -- we end up -- we used to hike. We were in an open, open field in the open area and\nthey bombed the hell out of it. And they came very frequently because of the fact that\nthey produced oil, fuel --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- out of coal. They extracted fuel.",
        "Q: So it was --",
        "A:",
        "Q: It was a target. It was, you know, trying to take up something that could help the\nGerman war effort --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, so when they bombed the place, you had no place to go. And we were in\nthe open. For some reason or another, I walked in through one of the bunkers that they\nbuilt, that we built for them.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They had -- I went in there and for whatever reason they didn't kick me out, this one\npart.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they bombed the hell out of it. You know, they -- it just choked. They couldn't\npenetrate. It didn't kill anybody except a piece of cement fell on some person there that\nkilled them.",
        "Q: But it meant that you were a hair's breadth away from death so many times, so many\ntimes. And it's incredible. It's incredible. I mean, it gets me -- gives me the sense -- I\nmean, one of the questions that I have is did you ever not have fear? For the entire six\nyears, was there anytime you were not afraid?",
        "A: No. I was afraid. I was afraid for my life. I'd run into -- one time during an air raid, I\nwent into a shack --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- you know, that had a shed on top of it. And basically people do that for shrapnels.\nThe debris starts falling when the bomb explodes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they buried all the -- the whole -- there were about ten people there. And we\nwere all buried. Fortunately enough, another bomb dropped nearby and uncovered us\nand we found each other right on top of one other.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Well, any final thoughts?",
        "A: No. I hope it never happen again.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Well, as I say, I know that it cost -- I know that it's not easy to\nremember these things but I also, on behalf of the museum, I'm very appreciative that\nyou've taken the time and that you have shared all of this with me today and through us to\nbe able to share it with those who will research and those who will show interest in what\nhappened to people, in the future. So with that, I'd like to say that this concludes --",
        "A: Well, excuse me one second.",
        "Q: Anything else you want to add?",
        "A: I only want to add one thing.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's do that before I --",
        "A: I want to go back in time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: whole thing. But this man that they shot that I told you, they took us out,\nan old man.",
        "Q: The father?",
        "A: The father.",
        "Q: The father of those ;",
        "A: The father they shot.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: They had me out there. And for whatever reason, you know -- we were against the\nwall. For whatever reason, he just couldn't do it. And they told me that --",
        "Q: Are you talking when you were in the ghetto, you mean?",
        "A: In the ghetto. When the ghetto was closing.",
        "Q: When the ghetto was closing. So was it a German soldier who was doing the\nshooting?",
        "A: It could have been a Pole also.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Or a German. I don't know who they were, you know. It wasn't the SS.",
        "Q: Okay. And it was in a --",
        "A: I think they were SA people. You know what they are, right, I'm sure?",
        "Q: Excuse me. SA\u201d?",
        "A: SA.",
        "Q: Yeah. SA, yeah.",
        "A: Okay. The SS people.",
        "Q: There were SS and there were SA too, yeah.",
        "A: SA. They are the ones who did the shooting.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: So anyhow, I didn't have to go for burial. You know, I don't know what they did.\nThere were about 19, 20 people there that were killed that day -- that night.",
        "Q: That's right, in the middle of the night.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "A: I know you probably had a burden on you, you know. people.",
        "Q: Well, it is -- I'll finish, I'll finish our final statement and we can then talk a little bit\nmore. But what I'm going to say right now 1s that this concludes the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jacques Ribons on May 20th, 2014.\nThank you again, Mr. Ribons.",

It is a continuation and addition to the interview we conducted with Mr.\nRibons on May 20, 2014. There were some topics that were omitted from the original\ninterview, and Mr. Ribons would now like to complete that picture. So please, Mr.\nRibons, let me know what it is that you wanted to add to what you originally talked to us\nabout.",
        "A: I am not sure that I gave the interview on the subject of a march from Blechhammer\nto Gross-Rosen.",
        "Q: Let's talk about it in detail, even if it might be in the original interview. Tell me\nabout that march and as much as you remember. And what about it 1s significant in your\nmind?",
        "A: Well, the Russian Army came close, took over just about all of Poland.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you can hear the rifle shots, and the Germans took out the whole tent, with the\nexception of some very sick people that were left there. And we start walking. We didn't\nknow where we were going or nothing.",
        "Q: So which camp was this?",
        "A: This was Blechhammer.",
        "Q: Blechhammer. Okay.",
        "A: So from Blechhammer we walked. And every second night or every night, if I\nremember right, they took us to a farm. And we slept outside in the barns, where they\nhad the cows and the pigs, and you know, the prisoners went there to sleep.",
        "Q: And so what time of year was this?",
        "A: What time of year?",

        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to walk?",
        "A: It was difficult to walk. Mainly, we walk on the main streets, where the German\nArmy started retreating. We walked alongside the ravine, so to speak, you know,\nalongside that main street. And there were guns, but the Russians machine gun the area\nwhere the Germans were walking. And occasionally, they hit us as we were walking.",
        "Q: Can I interrupt just for a second?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: When they machine gun, does that mean they were flying overhead and doing this?",
        "A: The Russian Air Force was flying overhead and had machine guns, primarily, aimed\nat the Germans. So they had German guards with machine guns watching us. So they\nkind of machine gunned along the line of the prisoners.",
        "Q: Isee. So they must have been flying pretty low, and it was nevertheless dangerous\nbecause you were walking right next to them --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- on the side of the road?",
        "A: Correct. So occasionally, they killed some prisoners. I don't think they could have\nhelped it. They were aiming at the guards, primarily, and they carried guns, machine\nguns and rifles and so on to watch the prisoners. And we walked. Probably every night\nwe stopped. We slept outside in the snow. And on a Sunday, we wound up in a barn\nwith the cows and pigs.",
        "Q: How were you dressed?",
        "A: In -- very skimpy, in the prisoners' uniforms that we wore. Myself, personally, I had\na -- I happened to have a sweater somehow. I don't remember how I got it. And I wore\nthat sweater. And I also wore bags, you know, the empty bags of cement as protection to\nkeep warm.",
        "Q: And you would wear that under the uniform?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.",
        "Q: And what kind of footwear did you have?",
        "A: Myself, I had a pair of boots somehow I got, and there were no soles on them.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: So you know, they were very skimpy. It was actually -- you know, we got all wet.\nMy feet got all wet. And well, I didn't have any shoes. So I wrapped, you know, some of\nthe stuff, my feet in cloth, that I could find or whatever I could get, you know, so my feet\nwouldn't freeze.",
        "Q: So when you were walking along the side of the road, and it was January, and there\nwas the machine gunning from the Soviets, and the Germans as well, were there snow\ndrifts? Was it loud? Was it icy?",
        "A: No. We actually walked not on the outside of the road, because it was impossible to\nwalk, but we walked on the main road to the side.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: And you know, on one side of the street. And as we were walking, the Russians, I\ndon't know if willingly or not, the machine gun, primarily, they tried to machine gun the\nguards.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And of course, the guards moved in among the prisoners. So you know, I guess they\nmust have hit some prisoners.",
        "Q: Isee. So the guards would realize this, and then they would intermingle with the\nprisoners?",
        "A: With the prisoners, correct.",
        "Q: Isee. And by that point, were there a lot of German guards, or was it few and far\nbetween?",
        "A: No, it was a lot of guards. Again, they carried machine guns. However, you know,\nthe roads were full of people going west, because the Russians were right behind us. So\nwe could hear rifle shots from time to time. So they were very, very close behind us.",
        "Q: So you were about to talk about one Sunday you ended up someplace.",
        "A: One Sunday, we ended up in a barn. I don't know where that was. And they gave us\ncoffee. And they were shooting, practicing, I guess, either that or shooting at the legs of\nthe prisoners. So of course, they fell, and us, we left them there.",
        "Q: Who was doing the shooting?",
        "A: The Germans.",
        "Q: The Germans were shooting at the legs of the prisoners?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: As you were drinking coffee?",
        "A: Well, we were getting coffee from that big -- what do you call it -- pot, and they were\ngiving the prisoners coffee. Well, the prisoners did, but the Germans are the ones that\nallowed that to happen, the coffee pot.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And as we got the coffee, they were shooting at the legs of the prisoners.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: So when that happened, of course, they fell. They couldn't stand up.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: And we had to leave them behind. And I am sure -- I personally didn't see it, but I'm\nsure they killed them after they left.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Did people die as they were marching?",
        "A: Oh, yes, many, many people. They were actually froze to death. We had to sleep in\nthe snow. Occasionally, on a Sunday -- we walked about three Sundays, and I was able,\nwith my brother and some other kids, get into a barn with the cows and the pigs, you\nknow, and keep warm, you know.",
        "Q: So you were walking for at least three Sundays?",
        "A: I believe it was three Sundays.",
        "Q: So that would mean at least two weeks, maybe more?",
        "A: Three weeks.",
        "Q: Three weeks?",
        "A: About two to three weeks. And again, I don't know how many prisoners died during\nthat march.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, it must have been an enormous amount of prisoners that passed on. I try to --\nI'm sorry.",
        "Q: No, I was going to say, it's the kind of stamina you would need in order to survive\nthat would be very high, and some people just couldn't hold out.",
        "A: That's correct. We fought for our lives, literally.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I was fortunate. I was able to make it. I tried to help a man that I knew in\nprison. He was from France. And his name was Ribak.",
        "Q: Ribak?",
        "A: R-I-B-A-C or B-A-K. I don't know how he spelled it.",
        "Q: R-I-C --",
        "A: No, no. R -- Ribak.",
        "Q: Oh, R-I-B-A-C-K?",
        "A: R-I-B, yes. And I helped him as much as I could, and then I finally gave up. I\ncouldn't do it any longer, and --",
        "Q: In what way were you trying to help him; by helping him walk?",
        "A: By helping him walk. Yes, by helping him walk. I mean, I knew him in prison. We\noccasionally worked side by side, you know, so.",
        "Q: Did anybody try to escape?",
        "A: Probably. I didn't have the stamina. I wouldn't know where to go.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We were in Germany at the time, so.",
        "Q: Were there civilians on the road, too? I'm sorry I interrupted.",
        "A: Oh, yes, there were civilians. There were people with push carts and their\nbelongings. There were all kinds of people that walked, because they were trying to\navoid the Russians, you know, particularly if they were Germans, you know.",
        "Q: It sounds like chaos.",
        "A: Yes, it was, absolutely. And we had Russian prisoners, and you know, all kinds of\nprisoners walked alongside of us. The road wasn't big enough for all of these people that\nwalked, including the German Army.",
        "Q: Tell me this, how many lanes did it have, or at least the main roads you were on?\nWere they single lanes, one in each direction, or were they wider than that?",
        "A: I believe they were wider than that. I'm not sure, you know. Again, we were\nfighting for our lives. We didn't pay attention too much of what was going on around us,\nexcept, you know, we tried to hide from the bullets.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, and we didn't know they were Russian planes until they came down real\nlow.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So it was chaos, absolutely chaos.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it was a 250-mile stretch. And I took my daughter and my son and my grandson\non that stretch from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen in a van.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh.",
        "A: Just recently about a year ago.",
        "Q: So that would be like in 2013?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: So you redid the whole death march walk?",
        "A: The whole trip, yes, the whole trip. From my hometown where I was born to the trip,\nall the way to Gross-Rosen and from Gross-Rosen to Buchenwald.",
        "Q: So tell me, the 250 miles, does that go from your hometown to Buchenwald, or does\nthat go just from Blechhammer\u2019?",
        "A: From Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen was about a 250-mile stretch. At least, I didn't\nknow. My daughter told me that it was that distance.",
        "Q: Ofcourse. I mean, at that time, how would you know. It took you three weeks or so\nat that time. How long did it take by van when you went?",
        "A: By van, I don't know, about eight hours, ten hours. I'm not sure. I didn't even think\nof paying attention to that, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I drove with my daughter, my grandson and my son.",
        "Q: Did any of it look familiar to you, the road, when you went on it again?",
        "A: No, no, no. It was totally changed, because they -- first of all, you know, with so\nmuch chaos, you didn't even pay attention to anything, except, you know, you try to\nsurvive. You know, the food was very scarce. I was in one of the areas where you ate in\none of the farms that we walked in. I saw a house, people, that the farmer, I guess, lived\nin. And I run to the farmer, knocked on their door asking for food, for bread. And the\ncommander, so to speak, the person in charge of the prisoners, he said, What are you\ndoing here, in German. And I said, I would like to have something to eat. So that young\nwoman -- it was a young woman. He said, he says, you can give him bread, provided that\nyou sleep with me tonight.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So she says okay. And she gave me a loaf of bread. And when I went out, I got hit\nover my back with a cane. And I went to my brother, and I gave him half of the bread.\nWe ate that just one night, you know.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh. What a horrible -- what a horrible situation and how cruel, how\nabsolutely cruel.",
        "A: It's much crueler than anybody can even anticipate.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. What human beings will do in order to kill the humanity in others.",
        "A: Well, I would imagine, you know, it happens all over, even today.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So the cruelest animal on earth is the human being.",
        "Q: Unfortunately. Unfortunately.",
        "A: So anyhow, then we got to Gross-Rosen. We were there for several days. We were\npacked like sardines. And we had just a bowl of soup during the day. And I don't\nremember whether we got bread or not. We were there for almost about a week. And\nthat was Gross-Rosen. And Gross-Rosen was very secluded, because they had -- they\nwere mining marble in that area. So the people on the outside couldn't see what was\ngoing on there in that -- in Gross-Rosen. And you know, after five days or so, a week\nmaybe, maybe longer, they loaded up -- they loaded us up on the freight trains. They\nwere going and taking the marble to market, I guess. And they loaded up the prisoners\non these open freight trains, and they took us. We didn't know where we were going, and\nwith guards on them. Each car had two guards with machine guns or regular guns. I'm\nnot sure what. At that time, I wasn't really familiar with the weapons.",
        "Q: Yeah. Just that they can kill.",
        "A: Right. So they -- when they loaded us up, we were on the way. And we got all the\nway to Weimar where we were bombed. I think the allied's air force made a mistake and\ndidn't know who it was, because they did see guards watching these things, you know,\nand they bombed the train. A lot of Germans, the guards, including the prisoners, were\nkilled, a lot of them.",
        "Q: Yeah. And this was allied bombing?",
        "A: This was allied bombing. I don't know what air force that was there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But primarily, I think the U.S. Air Force was in that area, or the U.S. Army was in\nthat area, you know, so.",
        "Q: Did you ever make it then to Buchenwald \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or just to Weimar?",
        "A: No, we made it into Buchenwald. They took us to Buchenwald, and I --",
        "Q: Excuse me. Can I interrupt you for a minute.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Did the train go until Weimar, the Town of Weimar, or did it go up to the camp at\nBuchenwald?",
        "A: To my knowledge, the railroad into Buchenwald, the railroad tracks, to my\nknowledge, if I remember right, were bombed out. So they took us by truck.",
        "Q: Isee. I see.",
        "A: Into Buchenwald. It was not all that far.",
        "Q: No, no. It isn't that far.",
        "A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war. Because Buchenwald 1s in the\nmountains, and this is below the mountain. So from there, we were there, I don't know,\nfrom January until April.",
        "Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time?",
        "A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks. It had three -- I think\nthey had three or four barracks where they kept just children. And I guess, there was a\nwhole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were\nprisoners.",
        "Q: Yes. In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners.",
        "A: Right. So they sort of protected, to my knowledge, the kids. And at the time that\nthey tried to take the kids out, we went to this appellplatz, and you know, we all lined up.\nAnd then they took us back to the barracks. What happened in the interim, I don't know.\nI guess they had -- they had, within the prison, you know, people that carried guns. In\nfact, outside of Buchenwald, there was an ammunition factory.",
        "Q: Now, I'm a little confused at this point. When you were in Buchenwald from\nJanuary to April, --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- who was in control?",
        "A: Well, the Germans were in control. However, there also, since the factory where\nmost of the German prisoners worked, and the other prisoners, I don't know which one of\nthe prisoners they kept work in the ammunition factory, they smuggled in a lot of arms,\nthe Germans.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison. So I guess,\nthe Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian\nprisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans.",
        "Q: Okay. But when you are saying Germans, are you talking about German political\nprisoners or --",
        "A: German political prisoners that smuggled in arms.",
        "Q: Oh, I see what you are saying. They were working in the ammunitions factory.",
        "A: Inthe ammunitions factory.",
        "Q: They were smuggling in some arms that were kept secret from the authorities?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes.",
        "Q: And yet, they would patrol the place with those arms; is that correct?",
        "A: Not patrol, but they watched. As soon as the Germans left, they took over.",
        "Q: Isee. As soon as the regular Nazi, you know, they left, then these political prisoners",
        "A: Yes, these political prisoners came out and tried to help -- they were not just\nGermans. They were all kinds of prisoners. There were Swedes, and they had Danes. I\ndon't know where -- the Danes I can understand, but I don't understand the Swedes, how\nthey got there.",
        "Q: Yeah, because they are supposed to be neutral.",
        "A: Right. I don't know how they got there, but they had them there. So and the reason I\nknow that to be a fact is because I was hospitalized. I had extreme diarrhea that they -- I\nbegged them to take me away already. I couldn't take it anymore.",
        "Q: I remember that part in our conversation before, yes.",
        "A: Right. So --",
        "Q: And what was -- what did you do and your brother when you were there? Were you\nalso put to work or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- or not?",
        "A: No. In Buchenwald, we didn't work.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: At least the time, the period of time that I was there.",
        "Q: Isee. Okay.",
        "A: You know, there were deaths all over. People cut out the innards of the dead and ate,\nyou know. This is the kind of stuff that I saw. It was a matter of either dying or doing\nthat, so.",
        "Q: What about, when you say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners\ntook over, could you say that they liberated -- the German political prisoners liberated the\ncamp, or was it another army that did it?",
        "A: No, no. I think it was -- I can't think of the general's name that came in. Let me kind\nof put a little emphasis on the whole situation, the whole picture there.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: They had a -- if I can remember the town -- Erfurt.",
        "Q: Erfurt, yes, is near there.",
        "A: It was in the mountains, across the mountains. You could see from Buchenwald all\nthe way into the mountains of Erfurt. They had a battle going on in Erfurt. At night, we\nused to see the cannons going off, the artillery going off at night from Erfurt, because it\nlit up. So the general who was the tank commander, and I can't remember his name. My\nmemory 1s not like it used to be.",
        "Q: That's easy to find out though. We can look it up, you know, who that would have\nbeen.",
        "A: Well, he got killed in Germany in a car crash or something. I'm not sure how he\ndied, the general.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: He was in charge of the tank unit that came into Buchenwald.",
        "Q: And did you see then American soldiers?",
        "A: Yes. There was just a tank came in with a couple -- they opened the turret, and they\npeaked out. And the Germans were already gone. They jumped off the guard towers,\nand the prisoners were chasing them. You know, so they caught some. You know, it was\nall chaos, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They killed some, you know, and they brought some back to prison. So they -- the\nGermans were gone.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The army came in and -- the American Army came in, and of course, they start\ngiving us food, you know, rations and stuff like that. And then organizations came in\nfrom western Europe that fed us after a while. So but as a whole, Erfurt, they were there\nfor about a week or maybe more. They were shooting at the Germans across the\nmountains, and you could see it. At night, you could see it.",
        "Q: So when they finally came into the -- into Buchenwald itself, the tank and with the\nsolders, --",
        "A: The tank, yeah, with the people in it, opened the turret and looked out.",
        "Q: And did they get out?",
        "A: You know, I don't recall that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don't recall if they got out or were in the tanks.",
        "Q: Where were you when you saw this?",
        "A: We kind of roamed around, because there was nobody there to keep us anywhere,\nyou know, because the Germans were already gone. I saw the Germans -- you know, I\nused to sleep on the top bunk. It was three high.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the top bunk, I could look out the window. You know, what it is was glass, and\nwhen I got the window in a certain position, we could see the main road.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right. So they -- because we were on top of a mountain.",
        "Q: That's right. It was high up.",
        "A: Right. So we looked in there, and I saw the tanks, the Germans running and\nGermans jumping off the towers. And it was just like a movie scene of some sort. So\nthis 1s what I saw through that window. And I was kind of -- you know, because they\nwere shooting into the barracks. So we got to the ground on the floor, and we just waited\nit out, you know.",
        "Q: Were there any revenge killings?",
        "A: Yes. They had, some of the people, I don't know what rank they were, what capacity\nthey were, the Germans, they took them in to where they held the prisoners, the\nBuchenwald prisoners, you know, that they tortured them there. And they took the\nGermans, and they gave us two hours for people to go in and beat them up.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: So--",
        "Q: And things took place then, huh?",
        "A: Well, you know, you punch the guy. How much revenge can you take, you know,\nSO.",
        "Q: Yeah. What did I want to ask you? Now, there is a famous photograph of, I believe\nitis Eisenhower. I'm not exactly sure. But when he comes and he sees what has\nhappened at Buchenwald, he is so appalled that he orders the townspeople of Weimar to\ncome and be forced to look at --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- what was going on in the camp.",
        "A: Correct.\nQ. Were you still there when that happened?",
        "A: Yeah. That was in the beginning, you know, because we were there several weeks\nafter.",
        "Q: Okay. Can you tell me about that?",
        "A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. But you know, because first of all, the army\nkept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in.",
        "Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance?",
        "A: We saw them in the distance. We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact\nthat, you know, revenge would have taken place. And in the U.S., don't take revenge on\nother people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other\npeople.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever.",
        "Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the\ntownspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening?",
        "A: Well, you couldn't help some violence.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because the prison -- the wires were all torn down. You could go out through the\nwires anywhere you wanted to go. I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat,\nyou know, in the beginning.",
        "Q: And did they give them to you?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I think they had so much fear in them, that 1t was beyond belief.\nYou know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town. He was made\nmayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. I\ndon't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. I walked into the mayor's\nhouse, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike. He says, no problem. He gave me\nan address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike. And of course, the bikes were\nall hidden. You couldn't find them. So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm\nsaying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. And\nin fact, some of them were.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: By the Russian prisoners, you know, the ones that were older, not the youngsters,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Finish the story about the bike. Did you finally get a bike?",
        "A: No. They didn't have it. It was all empty.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All the barns were empty. Everything was empty. You know, so I didn't get a bike.",
        "Q: So but it means that by the time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there,\nyou were able to move out of the camp?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. Somehow or another, we got right through the fence. The fence was\ntorn apart, and we just walked out. And we went to the nearby towns. I went a couple of\ntimes to Weimar.",
        "Q: What was it like? Did you still wear your prisoner's uniform?",
        "A: We didn't have anything else, really. Just a prisoner's uniform.",
        "Q: How did people behave?",
        "A: Fear.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Some of them were beaten up by others, by the prisoners. So, you know, I was a kid\nincapable of doing anything, too weak.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: SO.",
        "Q: But you saw it in their eyes?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I saw it, saw them being beaten up, and they were beaten up when they\nbrought the Germans in. I don't know whether it was soldiers or civilians that were\nbrought in, and kept them where they used to torture the prisoners. They kept them there.\nAnd they used to let them in at, let's say, 3:00 in the afternoon for a half hour to beat the\nhell out of them, you know. But you know.",
        "Q: But were these civilians that were brought in there? A. Yes, civilians. I don't know\nwhat capacity, or if they were soldiers, they also were, you know, in probably civilian\nuniforms. I have no idea.",
        "Q: But what I'm trying to get at is, they weren't former guards that you could recognize?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Okay. The reason they were brought in is because they happened to be German, not\nbecause they happened to have been a particularly cruel guard?",
        "A: They had some too.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah. I'm sure.",
        "A: But they watched how much beating they could get, you know. They wouldn't\nallow, even though that person had seen about 19 Germans being shot, you know,\nsoldiers.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I couldn't tell you who shot them. I know they wore military uniforms, but\nwhether there were civilians in the uniforms or American or any other nationality that\nshot him, you know, so.",
        "Q: And how old were you at this point?",
        "A: Iwas born in 1927. This was '45.",
        "Q: You were 18 years old when you were seeing this?",
        "A: Yes. You know, we were used to seeing all kinds of stuff.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Ihave seen dogs chasing the prisoners and eat them up alive, you know, kill them\nand eat them. You know, it was not something -- or people being hung, for whatever\nreason that they found, you know. So it was not something that --",
        "Q: It's not new to you, in other words?",
        "A: -- I hadn't seen before. It wasn't new.",
        "Q: It wasn't new to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was already --",
        "A: I, myself, were under a gun once or twice, you know, but I -- they let me go.",
        "Q: You mean you were under threat of being shot?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And this was where?",
        "A: This was still in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Isee. Oh, Iremember. I remember. Yeah, you had told me about that. How long\ndid you stay at Buchenwald after the Americans arrived?",
        "A: It wasn't really that long. There was a -- you know, I didn't know, because I didn't --\nthere was a rabbi, I suppose. He was an American chaplain that worked on taking the\nkids out of Buchenwald. And I guess, each government, to my knowledge, I found out\nlater, let in so many kids. And some kids, I understand, went to Cuba. Some kids went\nto England. Some went to Switzerland, and they went to France, they went to Belgium.\nIt depended on the government how many kids they would allow in, into the country.",
        "Q: Isee. And so you were amongst that group?",
        "A: I was amongst that group that went to France.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay there? Where did they take you?",
        "A: They took us, if I -- if my memory 1s right, to a home that the Rothschild family\nowned.",
        "Q: That the Rothschild family owned?",
        "A: And they gave the home, I guess, to use for the kids for the summer. I don't know.\nThey had their hires in France to take care of all the kids. To what capacity, I have no\nidea. They gave us a home. They gave us food. They gave us schooling, you know.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: They sent us to school, you know. So it was a variety of things, and I don't know\nwho was what.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, like for instance, my friend, Elie Wiesel, look what happened to him. He\nwent to the Sorbonne in Paris.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You know, the guy that was also his friend, my hometown friend, a fellow by the\nname of Gallenstein (ph.), he went also to the Sorbonne, because they were geniuses.\nThey were geniuses, these guys. And I don't know who else. And they sent them to trade\nschools, and they sent them to different things. I came to the United States early enough,\nyou know, right past -- it wasn't that long after that, about a year, year and a half maybe.",
        "Q: Do you remember the date that you came to the U.S.?",
        "A: The date exactly --",
        "Q: Or the month?",
        "A: Yes, I do, but I have it written down.",
        "Q: It's okay. I'm just curious.",
        "A: Yes, Ido have it. I have it written down. I used to know, but I don't know now.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you sail into New York?",
        "A: At the moment, I cannot remember.",
        "Q: That's okay. Did you sail into New York or some other port?",
        "A: No, we came -- we went to -- from France, they took us to Sweden. We came from\nSweden across the SS Gripsholm, which used to be a cruise ship in War World II. It was\nreconverted into a passenger ship. And they brought us into New York. There was a lot\nof other people. There were a lot of Russian immigrants and all kinds of stuff, all kinds\nof people that were on that ship. And we came to New York. When I came here, they\ndidn't have Ellis Island anymore.",
        "Q: Okay. How did you -- where did you land?",
        "A: Well, I had an uncle in New Jersey. My uncle, supposedly, was going to come and\npick me up.",
        "Q: Oh, I remember this from the interview itself. And he couldn't on that particular day.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: And you --",
        "A: So the hirers, I believe, came to pick us up and kept us there for a few days.",
        "Q: Okay. So in order -- here's another question. Is there anything else from your first\ninterview, because I do remember we talked about coming to your uncle in New Jersey\nand then your life after that. Is there anything else you think you didn't cover in your\nEuropean experiences that you want to add, or do you think we pretty much touched it?",
        "A: Yes. We covered this. When we were in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they took all the Jewish people out.",
        "Q: And we're talking about your hometown ghetto?",
        "A: My hometown ghetto, when they took out all the Jewish people, the transportation to\ntake us to the next town, big town, was by horse and buggy.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Not by truck, not by train, nothing like that?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: By horse and buggy?",
        "A: They wouldn't spend money for gas to take the Jews across a couple of towns down.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So how long we traveled on that, you know, with the horse and buggy, I don't know.\nI can't really remember.",
        "Q: Yeah. But you remember going that way?",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My mother and my sister and my cousin, you know, my grandmother, we were all on\nthat horse and buggy thing.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, any other thoughts you'd like to add now? You know, we can always\ndo this again, by the way. If there is something that comes up that you have forgotten,\nwe can always make an appointment to talk again for a brief moment and then record\nthat.",
        "A: The march was very important because a lot of people died. I don't know how many.\nHundreds and hundreds of people died.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: From Weimar going to Gross-Rosen.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Because they'd shoot them. They'd shoot them in the legs. And when they did that,\nthey couldn't walk. And when we left, they shot them.",
        "Q: It's just --",
        "A: Or left them dead to die, either one of the two.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I've seen many kids my age, their legs were frozen. The flesh was peeling off\ntheir legs.",
        "Q: Oh, dear. Yeah.",
        "A: So I mean, it's --",
        "Q: Were there girls on the road too? I mean, was this usually young men, or were there\nwomen on the road as well?",
        "A: They had women. There were no girls. They had women that they kept for\nprostitution there in Blechhammer.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: So these were the women that they kept, that many came with us.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "A: And then they parted company. Where, I don't know.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, I'm very grateful that you have gone into more detail. It's not called a\ndeath march for nothing. It sounds horrific and amazing that you were able to survive it.",
        "A: Incidentally, another thing I need -- I don't need, but I'll tell you.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Icame to Paris.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And Iwas roaming the streets, you know. We were kids and curious or whatever. I\nran into a young girl that looked very familiar. Because the guy that I dragged to help\nwalk --",
        "Q: That's right, Mr. Ribak.",
        "A: Mr. Ribak.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Showed me pictures from his family. And he said his wife and his kids -- I don't\nknow if he had one child or not -- showed me pictures of them --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- being in Paris.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: AndI came to Paris. And now, you know, we were roaming the streets, and I see a\ngirl, a young girl that looks familiar. Well, I walked over to her.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Believe it or not, it turned out to be this guy's daughter.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I swear on my life.",
        "Q: So how did that happen? Did she say, My name --",
        "A: lapparently remembered from the picture what she looked like. I suppose this 1s\nwhat happened. And I asked her the last name. She told me the name is Ribak. And the\nfirst thing I said, is your dad alive. She says, yes.",
        "Q: So he made it?",
        "A: He made it. She took me over to their house.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: Isaw this guy Ribak, and it was really something.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "A: And if I could remember that from a picture, it's really something. I don't know. She\nlooked just like him.",
        "Q: Itis. I mean, there are many amazing moments and miracles here. One, that you\nrecognized her from a picture. Two, that he made it. Three, that she was able to bring\nyou to him and that you were able to find out what happened to him, and it's an amazing\nStory.\nDo you remember, after you left him, did he tell you how he came to make it?",
        "A: No, I really didn't talk about it.",
        "Q: Isee. I see.\nA. I didn't talk about it. I saw him, and I was so happy to see him, and I met his family.\nI don't remember if I met his wife, but I did meet his daughter. I saw her on the street.\nShe was going somewhere, you know.",
        "Q: Now, did you ever see him or have contact with him after that?",
        "A: No. No, I didn't.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I think I was busy with myself, you know.",
        "Q: Your own life, yeah.",
        "A: My own life and trying to put my life and my brother's life together.",
        "Q: Yeah. That was a big enough task.",
        "A: So anyhow, I told you about the story, I was drafted into the army here.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Soon and so forth. Now I cannot recall. There was something else I wanted to tell\nyou. And I, for the life of me, I'm trying to remember.",
        "Q: You know, if you have forgotten now and you do remember it, write it down and get\nin touch with me again, and we'll talk about it.",
        "A: Hold on just a second. I wrote something down.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Let me see what I -- let's see. The march from Gross-Rosen -- to Gross-Rosen, the\nfreight train, which you are aware of. People froze or got shot or whatever.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And let's see. I just told you about the frozen limbs.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "A: The legs and whatnot.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Unfortunately, these kids were my age, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That's all, really that I had written down.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, yes. When I was in that hospital.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: My brother --",
        "Q: And this hospital is in France?",
        "A: No, this hospital is in Buchenwald.",
        "Q: Oh, the one where you got sent for diarrhea, that one?",
        "A: Yes, right. And we used to get two slices of bread a day in rations when I was in the\nbarracks before I got sick. And my brother saved -- collected my rations and saved as\nmuch as a whole loaf of bread, a loaf wasn't that big, but 1t was a loaf of bread that he\nsaved for me when I got back. And he put his life in jeopardy.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: And you know, of course I shared the bread with him later. But when I got back,\nwhen we were still in prison, he had saved a whole loaf of bread.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "A: In fact, when he passed away, I talked about that to the people that were there, so.",
        "Q: Yeah. It is avery -- it's a moment that is -- shows truly what he was made of. Like\nthe moment when your mother tells you why she can't leave shows you the stuff she was\nmade of.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah. Thank you for adding that detail. Thank you very much.",
        "A: Thank you very much for listening to me again.",
        "Q: Mr. Ribons, itis my honor. And I appreciate -- I appreciate this.",
        "A: Well, I do have tears in my eyes.",
        "Q: Oh, I know. It's not easy.",
        "A: Thank you. I never had the nerve to do that, to be quite honest with you.",
        "Q: Well, I don't know what it's like to have gone through what you have, but I do know\nthere is a cost to bringing all of these things up. And I appreciate it.",
        "A: I did tell you about my Army life, didn't I?",
        "Q: I think you did.",
        "A: Yeah, I think I did.",
        "Q: Yeah. If-- yes, you did. Now that I recall, yes. We talked about your Army life and\nbeing in Korea and some of the experiences you had there. Again, if there is something,\nwe will -- at this point, I will wrap up our addition to our interview.

        "Q: Oh, that's charming.",
        "Q: Do you did you know who Hitler was or did people talk about Hitler or was he",
        "Q: Is this during the war or before?",
        "Q: When the war already started.",
        "Q: Did any Jews from Germany come to since you were close to the German border,\ndid any Jews from Germany come to Poland before the war started?",
        "Q: Running away from Germany?",
        "Q: Some.",
        "Q: Uh huh. And did they fit into the community or did they look very different?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Such a human thing. What was the main economy in the town?",
        "Q: I see. I see. So did most people I mean, did most people work in the mines or have,\nyou know, family members work in the mines and then also the support functions to that?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: So how did Jews support themselves?",
        "Q: What kind of clothing?",
        "Q: When you went to school, at that time you were old enough was she able to afford a\npair of shoes for you?",
        "Q: You were already maybe, like, an 11 , 12 year old boy.",
        "Q: Did your younger brother and sister go to school? Maybe your sister not, but did",
        "Q: Were you hungry at any time? Did you have enough to eat when you were a kid?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: That's right. Did you also have any chores that you had to do as you were growing up?",
        "Q: What did people say? I mean, inthis inthis small place or big village, as you say,\nbut, you know, not one that had were there people who had cars?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Well, what a car.",
        "Q: And so that's a rarity. Things like that were did anybody own a radio?",
        "Q: You had one too?",
        "Q: So you had they told you to turn it in rather than coming to the house?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Had you ever before the Germans came, before the World War started, did you\nlisten to the radio outside of you know, radio broadcasts that came from London or\nother places outside of Poland?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: To the Czech border?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh huh. In Czech or in German?",
        "Q: So you could understand what they were saying?",
        "Q: And was this about the time that Czechoslovakia was annexed to Germany or before?",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "Q: I guess what I'm trying to do is get a sense of how much information came into the\ntown. How well informed were people about the larger historical, you know, things that\nwere going on? The political developments that were going on? Were people afraid or\ndid it all seem very distant?",
        "Q: Uh huh?",
        "Q: So there was talk of war, but there was also a confidence that you could beat\nsomebody who invades your country?",
        "Q: There was no confidence?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you're saying there was some sort of sabotage from within?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I see. So it was in that sense that you that there was talk that they were coming and\nthey'll overrun us immediately? That sort of talk?",
        "Q: Tell me the first time that you do you remember where you were when you learned\nthat the war had broken out?",
        "Q: So there was an as announcement over the radio?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: One yeah.",
        "Q: I see. So it was for his breath.",
        "Q: And when was the first time you saw any did you see German soldiers soon after\nthat announcement came? When did you first have the war come to you?",
        "Q: Okay. What happened?",
        "Q: So this sounds like it was not based on whether you were Jewish or not but based\nmore if you were, like, a community leader. 'Cause a priest or a rabbi would be a\ncommunity leader.",
        "Q: Okay. And they were the ones who were being arrested and killed?",
        "Q: Did you see anything did you see any violence on the streets?",
        "Q: So you stayed at home. When you found out that the war was on, your mother and\nyour brother and your sister you stayed inside the house?",
        "Q: And when did you first venture out?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: They did not. Okay.",
        "Q: Were you similar you said you mother was very religious. But in your dress and in\nyour manners and so on, you were indistinguishable from anybody else?",
        "Q: I see. Okay. And what is the first thing that you noticed that was different?",
        "Q: So in other words, I get the sense that there's really no fighting that actually happened;\nthat there was no fight that was put up in your area. They just ran in.",
        "Q: They just overran the place?",
        "Q: When you say they came in then, does that mean no soldiers were there? No\nWehrmacht was there or",
        "Q: Yeah. Uh huh. But no Polish soldiers?",
        "Q: They were all gone. Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. So aside from aside from rationing and, you said, the ruthlessness of the\nGerman soldiers, how else did life change?",
        "Q: Was that across the board for everybody or was this particular targeted to the Jews?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was there in those early days, was there any discrimination against the Jews that\nwas harsher or more different than, let's say, the Polish population?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Well, when you would go, you know, I take it out of, like, a child's curiosity to see\nwhat was\u2019 what are some of the things you saw?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Did you see things like that? Did you see people being beaten?",
        "Q: Okay. We'll probably be there soon. Tell me, what happened with your mother and\nyour father? How did they start how did they continue to put food on the table? I take\nit your father, when he came back, didn't leave again because, where would he go?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Uh huh. That's quite impressive",
        "Q: to know that many languages.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. I got",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That's very responsible.",
        "Q: Was he a harsh man?",
        "Q: Was he distant then? Decent but distant?",
        "Q: I got that. Okay. So he became a mediator, you know, between the Germans and the\nJewish community.",
        "Q: And did I understand correctly that sometimes he would just perform some services\nfor the Germans and then he was able to put food on the table because of that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: So did he come home and talk about all of these things or did",
        "Q: Never, huh?",
        "Q: For somebody.",
        "Q: For somebody's life.",
        "Q: Uh huh. How long did you all live in this kind of situation? How long did this kind of\nlimbo situation last?",
        "Q: So were you in a ghetto or were you just",
        "Q: So in other words, for a year and a half or almost two years",
        "Q: Okay. So it would be from September '39 to September '40, one could say?",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "Q: Something like that. Your you still lived in your own home. You were under this\nthis occupation regime.",
        "Q: It was bad but there was no sense yet that the Jews are going to be targeted for some\nspecial special treatment in the negative sense? It was it was bad for everybody\u201d?",
        "Q: Yeah. Of course. Of course.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. It would be clues. It's from your child's memories that I'm trying to get\nthis picture of what things were like.",
        "Q: Yeah. So did life stay the same, pretty much, until the ghetto was formed or were\nthere some incidents before it happened that",
        "Q: Tell me what those were.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: So how did they round them up? Did they block off streets or did they go by a list of\nnames? How did this happen?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So these why like public executions?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: And the ghetto was in the small town you were born and grew up in?",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. And so did you have to move into those two streets?",
        "Q: Was there indoor plumbing?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Before they formed the ghetto, were you going to school or was school suspended?",
        "Q: Okay. And what about the Polish kids?",
        "Q: Okay. So during the day, you just hung out at home?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Exactly.",
        "Q: And your father was with you when you moved into the ghetto?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: And what was\u2019 what did you have to do?",
        "Q: An electric welder?",
        "Q: You were welding wheelbarrows?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Well, did you get any kind of pay for this? Any kind of",
        "Q: No. So this was _ this was forced labor?",
        "Q: And no food?",
        "Q: Andno and no ability to say no?",
        "Q: Yeah. What kind of job did your father do? Was he continuing being a mediator?",
        "Q: And what did your mother do?",
        "Q: Did you\u2019 when you went to work in the morning, did you leave the ghetto area?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And the Jewish kapos are these people that you recognized and knew or were they\nstrangers?",
        "Q: And were they were they harsh? Were they",
        "Q: That's true.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That's when the ghetto gets liquidated?",
        "Q: A little bit at a time. Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. But and was that something everybody noticed, that another group was gone\nand another group 1s gone?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: And, again, how was this done when it was a little bit at a time? Was it by a list or\nwas it you were called to a square and then they would say every tenth person? How did\nthose people who get rounded up",
        "Q: I see. Were there more people who were doing the same thing as your father was\ndoing as a mediator?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you told me earlier that there was a story you had to tell me. It\nwas when I was asking about did you see people being beaten up, did you see people\nyou know, violence in the streets. And can you tell me what what happened?",
        "Q: So it was civilians who would do this, not just Army?",
        "Q: Did you see corpses in the streets?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Except for those two Polish Jewish soldiers.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "Q: Okay. So but you didn't see this public execution?",
        "Q: Remember, you said that there were a couple who were executed publicly. So",
        "Q: You saw it?",
        "Q: Yeah. That's an awful lot of violence for a 13 year old to see.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Did you yourself ever get beat up?",
        "Q: Okay. Were there I remember in the interview that we did in Los Angeles, you\nknow, where where we were only able to speak with you for a short amount of time",
        "Q: you did mention something about the son of the German police chief.",
        "Q: What was that about?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: The wrong side.",
        "Q: Oh, you wore the yellow star?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Q: It could have very easily been that way.",
        "Q: So was this before you had moved into the ghetto, before",
        "Q: Okay. And did you ever try and get food for the family or help in trying to trade\nthings so that there would be food?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. Then let's get to the part where you say that _ that, little by little, people, you\nknow, are rounded up and disappear and, you know, they're taken away. When did this\naffect your family? How did things develop that okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you knew\u2019 where were they going?",
        "Q: And how did you know about Auschwitz?",
        "Q: So this would have been what year? 1942 or '43?",
        "Q: '42.",
        "Q: Okay. So you already knew about Auschwitz's existence, and the Jews were being\nsent there.",
        "Q: Did you know that did you know about the gas and the",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: This place where you were waiting and hiding it was outside the ghetto?",
        "Q: Okay. And so it wasn't far away from the ghetto, or it was far away?",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "Q: It was still within the town?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Where was your father's here? Was he there too?",
        "Q: I'm here, but I'm kind of shocked. So he kind of abandoned his family?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: What a hard thing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So did you walk the streets to turn yourselves in to the Germans or they were invited",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: I'm you know something? Is the phone farther away from you? Because now the\nsound is not as good.",
        "Q: Now it's better. Now it's better.",
        "Q: Now I can't hear you at all.",
        "Q: Now I can hear you. Itis at some points, it's muffled and at some points it's clearer.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Now excuse me. Now it's muffled again.",
        "Q: We were fine we were fine until just, like, when I started to say the sound is\nmuffled. Did you switch or move the phone a little bit?",
        "Q: Now it's perfect.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: In front of you?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh.",

        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "Q: So they put you in a different room and they took then your mother and your sister and\nyour grandmother and niece they took them away to another camp?",
        "Q: They took them to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Now it's better.",
        "Q: So",
        "Q: So you \u2014 that conversation that you had with",
        "Q: The conversation you had with your mother where it was you know, you kind of\ndecided that you would try to save yourself and your brother.",
        "Q: Well, that was that was I mean, that's an amazing what an amazing person that",
        "Q: that she said",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, but here's my other question: Did you have much choice in being split apart or\nwere you split apart by the authorities?",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. So that was the _ that was the situation that you found yourself in.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Hello? Hello?",
        "Q: Hello?",
        "Q: Yes. I'm here.",
        "Q: In the pentplas.",
        "Q: So you would be forced to see these things?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Tell me, what kind of work did you do?",
        "Q: So you were there from 1942 to 1944?",
        "Q: Of course. Of course. Of course. But do you remember if you got there in the fall or\nin the winter? Do you remember the time of year that it was that you finally ended up\nthere?",
        "Q: Okay. So it could have been harvest time? Could it have been",
        "Q: And tell me",
        "Q: It must have been hell on earth.",

        "Q: Did he?",
        "Q: So you met",
        "Q: But it's so unusual to here have a guard in the forced labor camp do that.",
        "Q: But let's just stay those two years in this camp. Tell me a little bit about the barracks\nthat you that you lived in and about the daily routine and, you know, how large it was.\nAnd where was it located? Was it in Poland or in Germany?",
        "Q: Oh, did you?",

        "Q: A Yiddish esvangzva arbeitzlager, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Mr. Jacques Ribons. And so we were talking about the Yiddish\nItzvongzaviteslaza (phonetic), which is a Jewish forced labor camp --",
        "Q: -- that you were part of. And I was asking things like what was the living situation.\nWhat kind of barracks did you have?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: With straw mattresses, uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "Q: So you were tattooed?",
        "Q: What's your number?",
        "Q: 178212.",
        "Q: Did that mean that there were -- you were -- there were at least 17,212 prisoners?",
        "Q: Were the women ever used for anything else? I mean, did they ever have actual jobs\nor was it they --",
        "Q: -- they were prostituted?",
        "Q: I know, I know. But it --",
        "Q: Well, it's a tragedy and a catastrophe all the way around.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, really? So then you became one of the subcamps of Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And so you -- did your treatment change? Did the food change?",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember the kind of music they were forced to play?",
        "Q: Marching music.",
        "Q: Was there anybody, in addition to that old guard, was there anybody who behaved in a\nmore humane way towards the prisoners amongst the guards or the, you know, the army\nor even the SS or were they all pretty brutal?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear.",
        "Q: I can hear you. I can hear you. Again, but I'm just speechless because I'm trying to\nimagine a young kid -- I mean, for anybody this would be, this would be horrifying but\nparticularly for young teenage boys, you know, young teenagers.",
        "Q: Excuse me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And your brother too?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. On the bottom bunk.",
        "Q: Did he do the same work that you did?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Three sets of brothers.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: I see. And you were in that camp.",
        "Q: So you kept in touch with them after the war.",
        "Q: But was he in this camp with you?",

        "Q: We should probably -- hang on just a second. I want to pause for a minute.",
        "Q: Okay. So you were -- you had quite an odyssey. You, you know, at age 12, not even\n12, you experience war and by the time you were 18, you have been through a forced\nlabor camp. You've lost your mother, your sister, your father. You have only your\nbrother. And you'd been through two concentration camps and through hell. And you\nend up in Los Angeles, where you marry and have four children. Tell me, when did you\nstart talking about what you had gone through? Did you tell your kids when they were\ngrowing up --",
        "Q: -- about what your experiences were?",

        "Q: No. Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, I see. I see. So in other words, there wasn't any interest on that part and so your\nchildren, you wanted to protect them from this --",
        "Q: Yeah. Did that change at some point?",
        "Q: When did it change?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And when did you start doing that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were they already grown up when they started asking questions?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Do you have grandchildren?",

        "Q: You both knew it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me, when you did start talking and telling, did it change you?",

        "Q: No, it's so many years later but nevertheless, it's the same -- it is back 1n the area, back\nin the places where it all happened.",
        "Q: And I can't imagine that it wouldn't have made an impression on them, that 1t wouldn't\nhave had great meaning for them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, what about you? When you went back, was it like it was in your\nmemory\u201d? What kind of impression did you have of your hometown?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Have you spoken at schools?",
        "Q: Have you spoken in classrooms to young kids?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Well, it could be that it was sold -- either they gave -- either they transported that\njewelry and gave it up to the government or the soldiers themselves just took it.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "Q: So you're saying jewelry that was buried in the ground on the site of Buchenwald.",
        "Q: Yeah, in the quarry.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You're talking about the Germans who did this before the war.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So this was the interview that you gave to a newspaper man.",
        "Q: Yeah. And it never went anywhere.",
        "Q: Well, I'm grateful that you have spoken with us today, you know, that you have\nwanted to get your story recorded by the Holocaust Museum here in Washington, D.C.\nWe're very, very appreciative that you've done it.",

        "Q: Yeah. Those were amazing words, an amazing, and an amazing sacrifice.",

        "Q: Is there anything else you would want to add to what we've talked about today?",
        "Q: You know, in one interview, you can never catch -- you can never get everything.",
        "Q: It's just like that in life. It's how -- we've talked for a couple of hours now but, you\nknow, we're talking about your whole life so how can you put all that in a few hours.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: You mean the dying people make noises.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Wow. Wow. So you couldn't even show that you were upset.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: But it meant that you were a hair's breadth away from death so many times, so many\ntimes. And it's incredible. It's incredible. I mean, it gets me -- gives me the sense -- I\nmean, one of the questions that I have is did you ever not have fear? For the entire six\nyears, was there anytime you were not afraid?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.",
        "Q: Well, any final thoughts?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Well, as I say, I know that it cost -- I know that it's not easy to\nremember these things but I also, on behalf of the museum, I'm very appreciative that\nyou've taken the time and that you have shared all of this with me today and through us to\nbe able to share it with those who will research and those who will show interest in what\nhappened to people, in the future. So with that, I'd like to say that this concludes --",

        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "Q: That's right, in the middle of the night.",
        "Q: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Well, it is -- I'll finish, I'll finish our final statement and we can then talk a little bit\nmore. But what I'm going to say right now 1s that this concludes the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jacques Ribons on May 20th, 2014.\nThank you again, Mr. Ribons.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nEnd of File Two\nBeginning File Three",
        "Q: Hello. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr.\nJacques Ribons on June 10, 2014, taking place between Washington, D.C. and Las\nVegas, Nevada. It is a continuation and addition to the interview we conducted with Mr.\nRibons on May 20, 2014. There were some topics that were omitted from the original\ninterview, and Mr. Ribons would now like to complete that picture. So please, Mr.",
        "Q: Let's talk about it in detail, even if it might be in the original interview. Tell me\nabout that march and as much as you remember. And what about it 1s significant in your\nmind?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So which camp was this?",
        "Q: Blechhammer. Okay.",
        "Q: And so what time of year was this?",
        "Q: Yeah. Was it winter?",
        "Q: So it was cold?",
        "Q: Okay. So was there snow on the ground?",
        "Q: Was it difficult to walk?",
        "Q: Can I interrupt just for a second?",
        "Q: When they machine gun, does that mean they were flying overhead and doing this?",
        "Q: Isee. So they must have been flying pretty low, and it was nevertheless dangerous\nbecause you were walking right next to them --",
        "Q: -- on the side of the road?",
        "Q: How were you dressed?",
        "Q: And you would wear that under the uniform?",
        "Q: And what kind of footwear did you have?",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "Q: So when you were walking along the side of the road, and it was January, and there\nwas the machine gunning from the Soviets, and the Germans as well, were there snow\ndrifts? Was it loud? Was it icy?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Isee. So the guards would realize this, and then they would intermingle with the\nprisoners?",
        "Q: Isee. And by that point, were there a lot of German guards, or was it few and far\nbetween?",
        "Q: So you were about to talk about one Sunday you ended up someplace.",
        "Q: Who was doing the shooting?",
        "Q: The Germans were shooting at the legs of the prisoners?",
        "Q: As you were drinking coffee?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah. Did people die as they were marching?",
        "Q: So you were walking for at least three Sundays?",
        "Q: So that would mean at least two weeks, maybe more?",
        "Q: Three weeks?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: No, I was going to say, it's the kind of stamina you would need in order to survive\nthat would be very high, and some people just couldn't hold out.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Ribak?",
        "Q: R-I-C --",
        "Q: Oh, R-I-B-A-C-K?",
        "Q: In what way were you trying to help him; by helping him walk?",
        "Q: Did anybody try to escape?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there civilians on the road, too? I'm sorry I interrupted.",
        "Q: It sounds like chaos.",
        "Q: Tell me this, how many lanes did it have, or at least the main roads you were on?\nWere they single lanes, one in each direction, or were they wider than that?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Q: So that would be like in 2013?",
        "Q: So you redid the whole death march walk?",
        "Q: So tell me, the 250 miles, does that go from your hometown to Buchenwald, or does\nthat go just from Blechhammer\u2019?",
        "Q: Ofcourse. I mean, at that time, how would you know. It took you three weeks or so\nat that time. How long did it take by van when you went?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did any of it look familiar to you, the road, when you went on it again?",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh. What a horrible -- what a horrible situation and how cruel, how\nabsolutely cruel.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. What human beings will do in order to kill the humanity in others.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Unfortunately. Unfortunately.",
        "Q: Yeah. Just that they can kill.",
        "Q: Yeah. And this was allied bombing?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you ever make it then to Buchenwald \u2014",
        "Q: -- or just to Weimar?",
        "Q: Excuse me. Can I interrupt you for a minute.",
        "Q: Did the train go until Weimar, the Town of Weimar, or did it go up to the camp at\nBuchenwald?",
        "Q: Isee. I see.",
        "Q: No, no. It isn't that far.",
        "Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time?",
        "Q: Yes. In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners.",
        "Q: Now, I'm a little confused at this point. When you were in Buchenwald from\nJanuary to April, --",
        "Q: -- who was in control?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. But when you are saying Germans, are you talking about German political\nprisoners or --",
        "Q: Oh, I see what you are saying. They were working in the ammunitions factory.",
        "Q: They were smuggling in some arms that were kept secret from the authorities?",
        "Q: And yet, they would patrol the place with those arms; is that correct?",
        "Q: Isee. As soon as the regular Nazi, you know, they left, then these political prisoners",
        "Q: Yeah, because they are supposed to be neutral.",
        "Q: I remember that part in our conversation before, yes.",
        "Q: And what was -- what did you do and your brother when you were there? Were you\nalso put to work or --",
        "Q: -- or not?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Isee. Okay.",
        "Q: What about, when you say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners\ntook over, could you say that they liberated -- the German political prisoners liberated the\ncamp, or was it another army that did it?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Erfurt, yes, is near there.",
        "Q: That's easy to find out though. We can look it up, you know, who that would have\nbeen.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "Q: And did you see then American soldiers?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So when they finally came into the -- into Buchenwald itself, the tank and with the\nsolders, --",
        "Q: And did they get out?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Where were you when you saw this?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: That's right. It was high up.",
        "Q: Were there any revenge killings?",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: And things took place then, huh?",
        "Q: Yeah. What did I want to ask you? Now, there is a famous photograph of, I believe\nitis Eisenhower. I'm not exactly sure. But when he comes and he sees what has\nhappened at Buchenwald, he is so appalled that he orders the townspeople of Weimar to\ncome and be forced to look at --",
        "Q: -- what was going on in the camp.",
        "Q: Okay. Can you tell me about that?",
        "Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the\ntownspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And did they give them to you?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Finish the story about the bike. Did you finally get a bike?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So but it means that by the time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there,\nyou were able to move out of the camp?",
        "Q: What was it like? Did you still wear your prisoner's uniform?",
        "Q: How did people behave?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: But you saw it in their eyes?",
        "Q: But were these civilians that were brought in there? A. Yes, civilians. I don't know\nwhat capacity, or if they were soldiers, they also were, you know, in probably civilian\nuniforms. I have no idea.",
        "Q: But what I'm trying to get at is, they weren't former guards that you could recognize?",
        "Q: Okay. The reason they were brought in is because they happened to be German, not\nbecause they happened to have been a particularly cruel guard?",
        "Q: Oh, yeah. I'm sure.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how old were you at this point?",
        "Q: You were 18 years old when you were seeing this?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: It's not new to you, in other words?",
        "Q: It wasn't new to you?",
        "Q: It was already --",
        "Q: You mean you were under threat of being shot?",
        "Q: And this was where?",
        "Q: Isee. Oh, Iremember. I remember. Yeah, you had told me about that. How long\ndid you stay at Buchenwald after the Americans arrived?",
        "Q: Isee. And so you were amongst that group?",
        "Q: And how long did you stay there? Where did they take you?",
        "Q: That the Rothschild family owned?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the date that you came to the U.S.?",
        "Q: Or the month?",
        "Q: It's okay. I'm just curious.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you sail into New York?",
        "Q: That's okay. Did you sail into New York or some other port?",
        "Q: Okay. How did you -- where did you land?",
        "Q: Oh, I remember this from the interview itself. And he couldn't on that particular day.",
        "Q: And you --",
        "Q: Okay. So in order -- here's another question. Is there anything else from your first\ninterview, because I do remember we talked about coming to your uncle in New Jersey\nand then your life after that. Is there anything else you think you didn't cover in your",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And we're talking about your hometown ghetto?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Not by truck, not by train, nothing like that?",
        "Q: By horse and buggy?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. But you remember going that way?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, any other thoughts you'd like to add now? You know, we can always",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: It's just --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, dear. Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there girls on the road too? I mean, was this usually young men, or were there\nwomen on the road as well?",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Isee.",
        "Q: Yeah. Well, I'm very grateful that you have gone into more detail. It's not called a\ndeath march for nothing. It sounds horrific and amazing that you were able to survive it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: That's right, Mr. Ribak.",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "Q: So he made it?",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Q: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Q: Itis. I mean, there are many amazing moments and miracles here. One, that you\nrecognized her from a picture. Two, that he made it. Three, that she was able to bring\nyou to him and that you were able to find out what happened to him, and it's an amazing\nStory.\nDo you remember, after you left him, did he tell you how he came to make it?",
        "Q: Isee. I see.",
        "Q: Now, did you ever see him or have contact with him after that?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Your own life, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. That was a big enough task.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You know, if you have forgotten now and you do remember it, write it down and get\nin touch with me again, and we'll talk about it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "Q: Amazing.",
        "Q: Yeah. It is avery -- it's a moment that is -- shows truly what he was made of. Like\nthe moment when your mother tells you why she can't leave shows you the stuff she was\nmade of.",
        "Q: Yeah. Thank you for adding that detail. Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Mr. Ribons, itis my honor. And I appreciate -- I appreciate this.",
        "Q: Oh, I know. It's not easy.",
        "Q: Well, I don't know what it's like to have gone through what you have, but I do know\nthere is a cost to bringing all of these things up. And I appreciate it.",
        "Q: I think you did.",
        "Q: Yeah. If-- yes, you did. Now that I recall, yes. We talked about your Army life and\nbeing in Korea and some of the experiences you had there.

        "A: Churches, I don't know. It had one large church, which was mostly _ I think all of it\nwas Catholic.",
        "A: And that's all I remember as of this town.",
        "A: We had a very minor interaction.",
        "A: Because they were hating Jews, you know. They were told that by the parents, by the\ngrandparents.",
        "A: I experienced it",
        "A: a lot.",
        "A: We had interaction. We were kids.",
        "A: Yes. They called us dirty Jews and so on and so forth, go to Palestine. We don't\nknow how to explain that we were I had a teacher who was German.",
        "A: Of German descent.",
        "A: If he was born in Poland or not, I don't know.",
        "A: He used to tell the Jewish kids, \"Wait till Hitler comes.\" This was before the war.",
        "A: Yes, it was.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We knew. We weren't aware too much on what he was like, what\nhe was. But we heard his name and the hating of Jews. Because, also, they had they\nbrought in the Germans brought in Jews from Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: When the war already started.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Some.",
        "A: Some.",
        "A: Not too many that I knew of.",
        "A: They didn't look very different, but they were kind of they had their nose up in the\nair, So to speak, you know.",
        "A: They were above everybody else.",
        "A: The main economy basically was coal mining.",
        "A: Yes, as far as I know, the non Jewish. The Jewish did not work in the mines.",
        "A: They wouldn't even hire them even if they wanted to. But, yes.",
        "A: Well, my mother my father used to send things to sell. She went out and sold them\nand kept us going. Made sure we dressed, we went to school. We had to have special\nclothing like Catholic kids wear. You know, we had to wear certain certain clothing",
        "A: attached to the shirt or whatever. And that was the kind of life. And it wasn't the best,\nat least not in my family.",
        "A: Hardly. Hardly. There was a couple times that I wore her shoes because I didn't have\nany any shoes to wear. And that was already just before the war started.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: My brother did. He was a year younger than I am even though he said two. It was\njust one year.",
        "A: No. There was always potatoes. There were always things that you could eat.",
        "A: But it was enough food. When I say food, I mean, you know, basics.",
        "A: Not much, you know. We didn't have a big house, so my mother cleaned and\nwhatever she did. And we were out playing when we were kids.",
        "A: Cars?",
        "A: No. The only thing \u2014 person that had a car that I remember was a doctor in town, and\nhe had a Mercedes.",
        "A: Yes, indeed.",
        "A: Yes. Just people owned and we had one.",
        "A: We had one too. When the Germans came, they took it away and we turned it in.",
        "A: Yes, to turn it in. Everybody had to turn in. You couldn't listen to the radio because if\nyou picked up in fact, you could pick up London on most radios.",
        "A: And they didn't want us to hear the news from London.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We _ like, one time we moved where my father and mother were born.",
        "A: And it's closer to the Czech border.",
        "A: To the Czech border. That was the other I don't know how far away it was. It was\nquite a distance.",
        "A: And we used to listen to Radio Prague.",
        "A: In German and Czech mostly.",
        "A: In a roundabout way, yes, because the Czech language is a Slavic language. So you\ncould understand some of it.",
        "A: Before and after.",
        "A: Yeah. But, you know, when the Germans came in, they took all the radios. You\nknow, there was a death penalty, at least they said, if they caught you to have a radio.",
        "A: No. My father went through World War I when he was a kid.",
        "A: And so he was aware of the things of war. And I heard him speak to his friends about\nthe war. And the consensus among them was it's not going to last very long. Because\nthey were aware there were planes and, you know, kinds of things that they can use to\nreally to doa job on another country. So they were aware of things. And I heard them\nspeak and I was sort of aware what was going on myself.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There was never any confidence because within the government",
        "A: the Polish government had some Germans in high office. And so they just they\nactually dismantled the air force before the war started.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And since it was you know, the last place I lived which was\nSulmierzyce, they wehadseen you know, it was very close to the German border.",
        "A: And we were aware but not to the extent that they came in with, which the blasts and\nthe armament and whatnot was going on. So the war was wasn't going to last very long.\nNobody believed that it's going to last very long. Because the Poles didn't have enough\nof a force to fight them off.",
        "A: Oh, yes. There was no doubt about it. And they did come in, and within a couple\ndays they were all occupied, the whole area.",
        "A: I was athome. Andit anda Polish Polish government called upon the people of\nage to come and join the military.",
        "A: There was an announcement. And so my father left",
        "A:tojoin notjoin. Hehadto hewasa_ inthe military before. It's been a couple\nyears. So, therefore, he was supposed to report to one of the military I would say where\nregister and they get you into the service.",
        "A: So he left. We didn't know where he was when the Germans came in. And my father\nfinally came home. I don't know how many how much time. I cannot remember the\ntime element it took for him to come back. He was _ told the story that he was captured\nby the Germans and they held him. And they were going to kill him and a whole bunch\nof people that they were going to kill. So they had my father had a gold Omega pocket\nwatch, which in those days was the style. And one of the German guards saw it. He\nsays, \"If you give me this, I'll let you go.\" So he gave him the watch and he really let him\ngo, and he came home.",
        "A: Right. Right. That was just the beginning.",
        "A: Within two days.",
        "A: The Germans moved in and they started killing people. They rounded up the teachers,\nthe priests, the rabbis, you know, and they started killing them.",
        "A: Right. The elite. The teachers, the doctors, the old the educated people.",
        "A: Right, either killed or sent to Germany to work. I am not aware how many people\nthey killed, but I know they did.",
        "A: From time to time. The occupation was broadcast and we didn't go out on the street\nuntil they entrenched themselves within the city, within the town.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: Right after. Right after a few days, we ventured out and _'cause we understood the\nlanguage.",
        "A: The German people the German soldiers did not know who was Jewish and who was\nnot.",
        "A: They did not.",
        "A: Right. Correct.",
        "A: The food. We didn't get much food. It was rationed. And the ruthlessness of the\nGerman occupiers. They'd just beat people up, beat kids up, beat grownups up and got\nthem to work or picked them up in the street and took them to work.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: They just came in, and that was\u2019 that was it. They did not there was no fight. There\nwas not a soldier within miles. And",
        "A: Oh, yes. The Wehrmacht came in, the SS right after that. You know, I didn't know\nwho was\u2019 an SS manis, but I did know what an Wehrmacht is.",
        "A: No. They were gone.",
        "A: 'Cause I never saw when the war started.",
        "A: You had to stay in line for to get a loaf of bread. Everything was in short supply.\nThere was no sugar, no nothing. You know, that whatever you had to do, you were\nrationed.",
        "A: That, I don't know. I would imagine it was across the board.",
        "A: I don't know.",
        "A: They didn't know _ they couldn't recognize one from the other unless they wear the\nreligious hair.",
        "A: Otherwise they didn't know who the Jews were.",
        "A: They just didn't know. And so, like, myself, I was able to go anywhere even where\nthe soldiers were and, you know, it was okay. I was afraid, but I did go. You know, I did\nsee them, you know. I didn't go near any Army installation or any you know, anything\nlike that. I avoided that. But, however, you know, they didn't they didn't know who the\nJews were or what they looked like unless they saw somebody who was religious that\nthey wore the _ the garb, the hair, the face, you know, and so on.",
        "A: A lot of military around there. There was a lot of they established the SS\nheadquarters. They took over the police department.",
        "A: So they had special German police. They didn't have any Polish. They just disbanded\nthem. And right when I was about 1n fear because they were ruthless. If they got ahold\nof somebody who did something, they either killed them or beat the hell out of them.",
        "A: Oh, yes, a lot. In fact, as we go, I have something I can tell you about myself, what\ntranspired.",
        "A: My father was gone for quite a while. We didn't know where he was.",
        "A: But when he came back, he is_ he was an educated person.",
        "A: He spoke German.",
        "A: Spoke clean Polish. He spoke a little bit between. He had knowledge of a lot of\nlanguages, you know; Russian, for instance. 'Cause his _ his father was a Russian\nteacher.",
        "A: Well",
        "A: Well, I was impressed with him, but I didn't like him, quite honestly.",
        "A: So about when he came back, he had to start providing things. He was able to go\namong the Germans, talk to them, establish a Jewish city hall.",
        "A: Which he was one of the people that worked for them. He was a mediator between\nthe Germans and the Jewish community.",
        "A: Yes, it was responsible. And but, you know, I",
        "A: No, he wasn't. He wasn't. Only when I did something I shouldn't have done.",
        "A: I would say I don't think he was instant. You know, I hugged him and, you know, he\nhugged me. You know, so but he was he was not a warm father, but he was not\ndistant.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: He was able to do things \u2014 the food was rationed.",
        "A: When we have a situation like we had, when you have rations, you have you have\nsometimes a preference if you know people.",
        "A: So this was the kind of thing that he did. But he also bailed out people that were\narrested.",
        "A: He paid them off. He did a lot of things that was for the Jewish community. The\nJewish community apparently gave him things, you know, for the Germans that were\nwhat he needed to buy the person out for money or for other things. I don't know. For\ngold. Idon't I would imagine. But he was a mediator between the Germans and the\nJewish community \u2014 the Jewish city hall that they formed. And, of course, they had\npeople that they talked to and that decided what to do, how to do it.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Never talked about anything. I never knew, but they do did know that he was a\nmediator because he used to bring home a lot of a suitcase for the money. And what\ndid he need money for? Only to buy out or to buy off a German, you know, for",
        "A: For",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It was probably about a year and a half, maybe two.",
        "A: This was before the ghetto the time they formed that ghetto.",
        "A: No, not quite. Not two years. About a year, I would say.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Something like that.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: We knew because there were a lot of killings taking place. There was a lot of stuff\nthat was going on. Being as young as I was, I wasn't aware of a lot of things. You have\nto remember, when the war started, I was 12 years old.",
        "A: AndI didn't I wasn't aware of no one person what was going on.",
        "A: Yeah. I understand.",
        "A: There were some things before it happened. They took a lot of people out.",
        "A: Well, they rounded up people.",
        "A: And they rounded up people and they just disappeared.",
        "A: And later on, we found out there were labor camps, after the war.",
        "A: Well, they had names. The some of the Polish people were turned the Jews in,\nperiod.",
        "A: So andthey rounded they rounded them up and they disappeared. And they were\nbrought back for instance, a couple Jewish Polish soldiers, and they killed them because\nthey did something that they didn't like. So they killed them so everybody can see or that\nmost people can see so that they wouldn't do it.",
        "A: Sort of, yes. Sort of. But then then after about a year orso I'm not sure as to the\ntime, you know, that",
        "A: at the place. They took a Polish two streets and took the Polish people out of there\nand put the Jewish in there. And then they had that 1s where the ghetto was formed.",
        "A: In the small town, yes. Another part of town where I used to live or another a part of\nwhat is called, quote, downtown area.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We had to move in. We had to have one room. We shared a place with\nanother family.",
        "A: You know, I do not recall that.",
        "A: The most people didn't have it. This was a newer house. I don't think so.",
        "A: I don't think so. And they formed a ghetto.",
        "A: School was suspended for the Jewish kids.",
        "A: The Polish kids had school, yes. They had schools for them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, what where can you go?",
        "A: No place to go.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He was with us. And moved into one room. There was five of us.",
        "A: And we had a little kitchen, you know, a small little kitchen. But that was the extent\nof it.",
        "A: And so the ghetto, when they took out people, like myself I was, like, again, 12, 13\nyears old at that time. And they put me to work.",
        "A: My job was I was an electric welder.",
        "A: Welder. They showed me how to do it and I was welding the wheelbarrows.",
        "A: Right. So they they produced they have that iron now. They had the company\nthere and they hired they got the Jewish kids.",
        "A: Or the Jewish people, you know, that were working and producing them.",
        "A: Oh, no.",
        "A: It was forced labor, absolutely.",
        "A: They didn't give us any food. The food was from the house, whatever you could get.",
        "A: That's correct. Because if you refused, you weren't around very long.",
        "A: Yes. He was a mediator to the very end of the ghetto.",
        "A: Not much. She tried to provide for us. She tried to keep us fed. Didn't do much.\nThere was no nothing that you can do. You were packed like herrings into a small area.",
        "A: They left we left when we left the ghetto area, we were under guards.",
        "A: They had some Jewish what they call kapos or whatever and the Germans. They\nwalked with us to the place of work.",
        "A: No; people that we knew. It wasn't that big of a town that we didn't know people, you\nknow, but yeah, we knew them.",
        "A: No. They just you know, kids are kids everywhere. They tried to get out of line.",
        "A: They put them back, you know. We didn't realize the enormity of this whole thing.",
        "A: So butI I don't know how to explain this. We used to go to work every morning\nand come home in the evening, and that was going on for quite a while. And a little bit at\nthe time, they took the Jews and shipped them out.",
        "A: Right, a little bit at a time.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. They what youcall they rounded up all the Jews.",
        "A: And they picked out whoever they wanted to pick out to send to the gas chambers or\nprison camps or such, you know.",
        "A: You were called to a square. Everybody had to appear. And they picked out I don't\nknow how they went about picking out picking out people. I have no idea. And but\nthey did. Families _ let's say, mother and father or mother and the kids, and I don't\nknow how they went about doing it. And my father occasionally was able to get\nsomebody back from what they picked out by buying them off.",
        "A: Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge. At least I didn't know any.",
        "A: There was violence. There was a German population that they moved in and they\nused to beat up the Jewish kids or the Jewish people.",
        "A: Civilians and occasionally they had the SS going through there. And, you know, they\npicked up people. They you know, I cannot explain they used to beat them up, and\nsometimes they picked them up and killed them.",
        "A: Not at the time that I was in the ghetto. I saw corpses from starvation. Occasionally,\nyes, I did see, but not many.",
        "A: They didn't do it in public view, so to speak.",
        "A: Two Polish Jewish soldiers; brought them in because they called the German soldier\nand I don't know what happened. And they brought them in.\nIt was a Jewish restaurant before the ghetto. And they used to the Jewish people used\nto go there to this what they call a restaurant. And they brought in this Jewish Polish\nsoldier that he was imprisoned. He was a POW. They brought him in to explain what\nhappened, what he did. And that was the end of him. After that, we didn't hear of him\nanymore.",
        "A: So logically speaking, knowing what I know, he didn't make it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I saw that.",
        "A: Yes. But I saw within the town. And they did something, and I don't know what they\ndid. And they just shot them.",
        "A: Hm, yeah. It was a bad time.",
        "A: No, not really. You know, I got hit a couple times across my back. But that's about it,\nyou know.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Well, we only were allowed to walk on one side of the street.",
        "A: The other side was for Aryans only. So here this kid you know, being a kid, again, I\nwent to the other side of the street.",
        "A: The wrong side, the one that I'm not supposed to. But I also wore a (inaudible) with\n\"Jew\" on it.",
        "A: Yellow star.",
        "A: So this kid came and pushed me off and I pushed him back. And we started hitting\neach other. Then he started running. I cornered him, kind of beat him up a little bit.\nAnd next thing I knew, the I found out later he belonged to the police officers police\ncaptain or something and they were looking for me.",
        "A: And I was hiding. Well, after a while they, stopped looking and everything turned out\nokay. But, you know, I guess if they would have caught me, I wouldn't laid on seen the\nlight of the day.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Yes. That was before.",
        "A: No. No. I depended on my father.",
        "A: Again, he was sort of a mediator there, you know. He was able to provide enough\nprovide for us.",
        "A: For a while, they used to call the people intoa intoaplace anopen place. All the\nJewish people came. They picked up some Jewish people and they just took them away.\nThat was the end of them; never heard from them again. The they didus they did this\nquite a few times. And then they did I don't know how many people they had left. We\nwere then in the ghetto. And they rounded up everybody. My father had a place that the\nneighbor was had a boyfriend who wasn't Jewish.",
        "A: And myself he took myself and my mother, my sister and my brother and my\ngrandmother that was his mother.",
        "A: And we went to this Polish man, and we were there waiting to see what happened.",
        "A: We were there only a couple of days.",
        "A: Here where it was. They took the bulk of the people that couldn't hide or couldn't\ndisappear and shipped out away and, you know\u2019 _we knew where they were going, but\nwe have no alternative of any kind.",
        "A: To Auschwitz.",
        "A: At that time, we already knew that this is what was happening to the Jewish people.",
        "A: 1942.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: The Jews were being sent there.",
        "A: Gas chambers.",
        "A: Not _ not really.",
        "A: Not really. We did know they disappeared, that they were gone, period. So we were\nhidden, and also there was a couple _ the girl's boyfriend one ofthe she had two\nbrothers in that family and a son. And we went, waited out to see what was going to\nhappen. Well, they took they closed up the ghetto, period, and they shipped the Jews\nout. Well, then we were left father and mother, these other people, and a son. The\ndaughters the one one ofthe daughters one daughter was already in prison. And our\nfamily, which was myself, my mother, my sister, my brother, and my grandmother,\nwhich was my father's mother.",
        "A: And we waited a day or so. The ghetto was gone. They took everybody.",
        "A: Outside the ghetto; a Polish guy that had a Jewish girlfriend.",
        "A: No. It wasn't that far away.",
        "A: It wasn't that far away.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: So we went there and waited out to see what was going to happen since they got all\nthe Jews out.",
        "A: And then they announced that any Jew that was being caught, they're going to shoot.\nWe heard that from this Polish guy that owned the apartment.",
        "A: So we didn't know what to do. My suggestion you know, I was then 13 years old.\nMy suggestion was to turn ourselves in. We have no place to go.",
        "A: Some of us would survive. Most of us wouldn't.",
        "A: My father was gone. He was he took his sister and they disappeared. So I don't\nknow. I think they went to a different town. He was able to buy himself time to go to a\ndifferent town. Are you there?",
        "A: So to speak, yes. And because he knew the end result. He really did.",
        "A: He didn't talk. He knew what was going on. So the question was: What do we do?",
        "A: 13 years old. And there was a man with his son and his wife ask me. I says, you\nknow, I'm 13 years old. I don't know.",
        "A: I said, you know, in my opinion, if we turn ourselves in we have absolutely no place\nto go. If we wait days, they catch us, they kill us. There's no there was no question\nabout that.",
        "A: I says, if we turn ourselves in, some of us have a chance to survive.",
        "A: Yes, a hard decision to make.",
        "A: So as it turned out, they they listened to me and we turned ourselves in to the\nGermans.",
        "A: To the Germans, yes.",
        "A: And we went we went back to the ghetto. They had one room there that they kept\nthe people that came back or were caught.",
        "A: And they just kept us in that room.",
        "A: So in the middle of the night, they took out they came in and they caused really\nruckus. They took this the couple, husband and wife, that were there with us.",
        "A: And ;",
        "A: They took us out.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Okay. ;",
        "A: You cannot?",
        "A: Okay. So I'm going to keep it away from my ear.",
        "A: The ;",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Can you hear me now\u2019?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: So they took us out outside at night.",
        "A: And they killed the mother and father and the son.",
        "A: In front of me. And they were going to do that to me too. They didn't, for whatever\nreason they had. And they took us back into the room",
        "A: where we were all in. And the following morning and they had some other people\nthat they killed. I don't know who they were. They killed something like 20 people, shot\nthem.",
        "A: So in the morning, they got some men bigger than I am to take them for burial. They\nburied them somewhere in the hillside. I don't know exactly where. And myself and\nwhoever else was there, which I don't remember, we went into the room back into the\nroom. Well, a day later, they took us out and they send us to a place called Bedzin.",
        "A: The ghetto was already eliminated.",
        "A: They caught people after that and they killed them. There was no question about them\ndoing that.",

        "A: And they put us I think there was a prison there",
        "A: they put us in. And they took people out for work. You know, they selected people to\ndo these things, I guess. So I was there with my mother, my brother, and my sister. And\nI was able to get out away from my mother because I talked to my mother and I said, \"I\ndon't want to leave you alone, Mom.\" So she says, \"Look, I cannot go with you. I cannot\nlet your sister, your grandmother, and your niece die by themselves.\"",
        "A: Well, it was a big decision to make. So I said to my brother, \"Let's see what we can\ntry maybe to save us. ourselves.\" And we did.",
        "A: They put us in a different room.",
        "A: And I don't know why, because my brother was really a tiny guy.",
        "A: So, you know and myself, I always looked well fed.",

        "A: Right. And my mother wanted us to go to do that.",
        "A: She was.",

        "A: There was no choices.",
        "A: Right. My brother. My brother was little and I you know, we were really surprised\nthat he was able to do that. And we went to that point, the Blechhammer, we found a lot\nof people from our own town.",
        "A: Yes. And so, you know, again, we worked. And some people died. They had people\nthat smoked, for instance. And they had everybody had to go out tothe tothe I\ndon't know the word.",
        "A: All the prisoners",
        "A: what they called a pentplas (phonetic). Hello?",
        "A: And the pentplas.",
        "A: And they did some hanging of the people that committed what they called a crime like\nsmoking, like doing something that they didn't want to show the people that if you\ncommit anything, we're going to do that to you. And they did hanging.",
        "A: And they hung a 15 year old boy who smoked, who worked with me.",
        "A: Because he smoked, they hung him. So anyhow, we were there for almost two years.",
        "A: The place that we worked was a conglomerate of all kinds of things. They produced\noil, coal extract oil from coal, fuel. They cement pipes all over the place. They used\nto bomb this place often. I don't know chemicals they used to produce there. Our job\nunloading cement bags of cement, mixing cement. These are, you know, things that\nthey can hide like, bunkers, we used to do. And when they bombed, they couldn't\npenetrate the bunkers.",
        "A: Something like that, you know. I you lose track of time.",
        "A: Well, let me put it to you this way: What I remember that we were picking fruit at\nhome, whatever we can find. And around that time of the year.",
        "A: Harvest, yes.",
        "A: Almost two years.",
        "A: Well, it was.",
        "A: They gave us spinach that they had, coal or little pebbles. They gave us soup. I don't\nknow what it was made out of, but people used to swell, you know, because they ate that\nsoup.",
        "A: And I ate two slices of bread a day.",
        "A: Yes, very much so. I don't know how many. You know, there's a couple people that I\nknew. One person in particular that I knew ran away from prison. He was from Poland.",
        "A: He went back to Poland and he had no place to go. He finally came back.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So when he came back, the Germans let him run, told him to run. And they used the\nGerman shepherds. And the only thing that I heard is a little scream, and that was the end\nof that person.",
        "A: So this goes to show you cruelty of",
        "A: these people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We kind of took care of each other.",
        "A: Well, we ate what they gave us, which was very little. Occasionally, the accountant\nwhen we walked to work a Yiddish POW contingent",
        "A: once in a while would send us some bread, threw it at us. . We made\nthe best of it. We survived. That was the main thing: Survival. And sometimes at work,\nwe had a guard that was very old that was probably in his late 60s or mid 60s that he used\nto give us some soup from time to time, a German guard.",
        "A: Yes. And he was from the Wehrmacht. And he was from Austria, an Austrian.",
        "A: Yes. He was from Austria. And he kind of you know, he used to say to us, \"Just\nhang in there. It's almost over. Hang in there.\" 'Cause, you know, he used to he told us\nabout the invasion of Normandy, for instance.",
        "A: Yes. It was amazing. I never could believe it, you know. He saw us walk out, throw\nus a little bit, you know, the best he could, you know.",
        "A: Anything else than what I just told you, you know ;",
        "A: Yes, it probably was. And but decided, you know, he couldn't work anymore\nanyway because he was evacuated.",
        "A: You know, I don't really know. I can tell you this: I went back there.",
        "A: Recently, with Lisa.",
        "A: Right. And we came out to this particular camp where I was. I think it was annexed\nby the Germans.",
        "A: Annexed by the Germans. Because my home town was annexed by the Germans.\nThey called it Oberschlesian.",
        "A: So_ because, you know, primarily the industry was coal.",
        "A: Were the coal mines. So I guess they needed coal to produce something there, so\nwhere was I?",
        "A: We were at that time at what they called a Yiddish esvangzva (phonetic) arbeitzlager.",
        "A: So this we were at war for quite a while.\nEnd of File One\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: We had, we had barracks. We were a little bit overcrowded.",
        "A: With straw mattresses.",
        "A: And bunks three high.",
        "A: So what they -- well, this is where they really kept us. And occasionally when\nsomebody, an inspection from Switzerland or Sweden came, we had to get rid of the\nmattresses. Got new mattresses and new straw. We had a couple of\ninspections.",
        "A: And when they walked by, they said how are you treated.",
        "A: You didn't tell them.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: No, not at all. I think they could see through it.",
        "A: But nothing was said.",
        "A: You know, I really don't know. I could not, I could not tell you, really, whether it was\nthe same commandant or not but he was -- I know afterwards -- you know, there were\nalso women which was used by the SS, by the military there.",
        "A: There was women.",
        "A: Yes, Jewish women. Their husbands were prisoners. And they used them for their\nown use.",
        "A: And so they -- we were there about, I guess, maybe a year, maybe not, the SS took\nover. And they came in and gave us concentration camp clothing. And they put numbers\non US.",
        "A: I was tattooed, yes.",
        "A: 178212.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Probably. I don't, I really don't know. I could not account for anything, you know.\nReally, I can only tell you what I saw and what transpired there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were prostituted. That's -- I wouldn't -- I didn't want to use that term.",
        "A: They had husbands there. That's the irony of it.",
        "A: Right. Then they gave us the concentration camp clothing and I was tattooed.",
        "A: And we were part of Auschwitz, became part of Auschwitz.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: The food was the same. There were -- only thing, you know, they used to -- they got\npeople, the prisoners, to play music as we marched out and as we came in.",
        "A: You know, there was people that were -- you know, they had people, like Jews from\nHolland, Jews from France.",
        "A: Jews from just about everywhere. The Polish Jews were, I think, the predominant,\nyou know, people, so. But --",
        "A: March music.",
        "A: Yes. And, you know --",
        "A: I wouldn't say -- only if they think you committed a crime.",
        "A: Like smoking.",
        "A: Like stealing. Things, you know, of that nature.",
        "A: They put you up on the gallows so everybody can watch. And we watched quite a bit\nof that.",
        "A: Can you hear me?",
        "A: There was no ;",
        "A: They took us out. We had to watch while they do it.",
        "A: We were beaten up by them but it's something -- I don't know what I did. I don't\nremember. I was hit a couple times, you know. They hit me over the back, over my rear\nend, you know, and --",
        "A: My brother, basically, no.",
        "A: He was with me. I tried to protect him the best I could. And I did, you know. I\ncouldn't do much for him, you know, except we kind of were very close together. He -- I\nslept in the middle bunk and he slept in the down bunk.",
        "A: The bottom bunk. And the third person, I don't remember who it was. You know,\nyou, you were only fighting for your own life, so, you know.",
        "A: Yes. He was a year younger than me. And he was very skinny. He was a little guy,\nperiod.",
        "A: And I had people from my hometown, you know, kids like myself from my\nhometown. Three sets of brothers, in fact, that survived.",
        "A: Three set of brothers.",
        "A: Myself and my brother. Another couple, which they -- I don't know whether they're\nstill alive. They were their friends. We had another set of brothers that were very close\nto the -- one of the brothers was a . He was very close friends with Elie\nWiesel.",
        "A: Yes. He was a scientist who worked for Brooklyn -- the naval yard and died of\ncancer.",
        "A: Yes. In a roundabout way, yes, yes. Elie Wiesel I haven't seen for -- since we got\nhere. Since we left Europe, in fact.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I met him in Buchenwald.",
        "A: Yes, we were transferred. Let me, let me back up a little bit.",
        "A: Continue the story.",
        "A: We were taken out and the Russian army came close.",
        "A: We were taken out and -- to walk. So we started walking. We slept outdoors. And\nthis was, mind you, during the winter season and it was snowing.",
        "A: We kept walking. Probably half the people didn't make it. Either froze to death or\ndidn't take care of sufficiently. I did the best I could. I washed myself with snow. I told\nmy brother to do the same because you get your blood going. And the walk, we walked\nand walked for probably a couple weeks, maybe more.",
        "A: Time was not of essence.",
        "A: We tried, you know, we tried to run into the homes. We slept in barns. From time to\ntime -- we finally, after two, three weeks, we got to a place called Gross-Rosen.",
        "A: It was sort of, I think, a death camp. They packed us in in barracks. And, I mean, we\nwere packed. The place was filling up almost. And I didn't think we were going to make\nit from there. But they took us from there. We were there about a week or two weeks.\nAgain, time wasn't --",
        "A: -- important anyhow. And they took us and packed us on open freight trains to Gross-\nRosen. Now, come to find out, after the war when I went back with Lisa, that it -- they\nproduced marble in that area. They were digging for marble. And the place was\nsurrounded but you -- the people outside could not look in. No access to it. So nobody\nknew what was going on in that prison camp.\nThey took us. Anyhow, they put us on freight trains.",
        "A: And they transported us to Weimar.",
        "A: Buchenwald is very close to Weimar. Well, lo and behold, there were air raids. And\nunfortunately, the U.S. Army didn't know, they of course didn't know who was down\nthere and they bombed that train --",
        "A: -- unfortunately. Anyhow, a lot of people passed at that time. And then they took us\ninto Weimar to Buchenwald.",
        "A: Buchenwald, right.",
        "A: And we were with kids, with other kids.",
        "A: We had two or three barracks or four barracks. I don't -- I'm not -- don't remember\nwhich, you know. And we were on the, I guess on the famous barracks, 66.",
        "A: I don't know. I think everybody that I heard about, they were talking about barracks\n66.",
        "A: older kids. Maybe that was the reason.",
        "A: And anyhow, they gave us a little bit of soup a day and they took us from\nout, to march us out. Then put us back. We were supposed to go down for a while. And\nI got so sick that I really begged them to take me away. I had, unfortunately, diarrhea so\nbad --",
        "A: -- I could no longer take it.",
        "A: So they took me into a -- I'm shaky. They took me into a barrack with a lot of, a lot of\nkids. I think -- what I saw was mostly kids.",
        "A: It was barracks set up for that purpose. I don't know -- I can tell you one thing. They\ntook so many people out every day and they didn't come back.",
        "A: After the war, I found out they were giving them -- they were killing them by giving\nthem an injection.",
        "A: Now, what happened to me is I kind of lucked out. There was a man that came up to\nme that was working there. Whether he was Jewish or not, I don't know. Whether he\nwas a doctor, I don't know. So he came, of all the kids, he came up to me and he said,\n\"How old are you?\" I said, \"Sixteen.\" He says, \"You have a long life ahead of you. Let\nme see what I can do for you.\"",
        "A: Well, let me get my composure. I'm just, I'm choking.",
        "A: Please.",
        "A: Just take a few minutes.\n(Pause)",
        "A: I don't remember if he was a doctor or not. But anyhow, he says, \"I'm going to see\nwhat I can do for you.\"",
        "A: He said, \"Let me take your stool.\"",
        "A: Which he took my stool and he took it. Wherever he took it, I don't know. He came\nback a few days later, which I was lucky they didn't put me into that room where --",
        "A: He says, \"I think I can help you.\" So he took me out and put me on a two-wheel\ntransportation thing, you know.",
        "A: Like a wheelbarrow. And he took me out. They took me to a hospital. I guess --\nthere were beds there, bunks, and things like that.",
        "A: It was in Buchenwald.",
        "A: They had other prisoners there, international prisoners.",
        "A: So they used these hospital primarily for non-Jews, you know.",
        "A: Occasionally they did have, like myself, they took me in there.\nIn comes a guy with an injection. It looked to me like it was a foot long. He gave me an\ninjection. He says, \"That will make you feel better.\" And they started giving me, I forgot\nwhat they call this, like a very plain cereal that you cook.",
        "A: Cream of wheat.",
        "A: Cream of -- this is what they fed me.",
        "A: And I gained a little weight. And I got news out to my brother, my brother was in the\nbarracks, 66, to see whether he can come. And I gave him some food. And they put me\nback, sort of, together.",
        "A: I couldn't even tell you.",
        "A: I don't know. When I got a little better, they sent me back to the barracks. And by\nthat time, the closing of the war was just about beginning.",
        "A: So we were there, I don't know how long I was still there, and the war was coming to\nan end.",
        "A: All of a sudden -- we used to hear the artillery from far away. It was -- I forgot the\nword for this. Erfurt. It was called Erfurt, the town.",
        "A: Erfurt, we used to hear the artillery. They were firing across to Weimar.",
        "A: And so we used to hear the cannons. And all of a sudden, we had a plane that came\nin, a tank that came in with U.S. soldiers. This was quite a while later. And they took\nout people. They took them out and never heard from them again.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, it was -- yeah, it was made in the -- I was there for quite a while longer.",
        "A: And then when the war was coming to an end, they broke through the lines, I suppose,\nfrom Erfurt --",
        "A: -- the U.S. military, the Third Army moved up and took over Weimar and they came\nin to us.",
        "A: The Americans liberated us in Buchenwald, yes. But it took -- it's a longer story than\nthat because they used to take out people out of the prison camp, either kill them or get\nrid of them. I don't know what they did with them.",
        "A: The Germans took them out.",
        "A: Before the U.S. came, the U.S. Army.",
        "A: Before they came.",
        "A: They took out, in fact, one of them, a person, my hometown, their father they took out.\nBut he was . For some reason or another, they kept the kids intact. The\nprisoners themselves were political prisoners, a lot of them. They made sure that these\nkids, these Jewish kids, that they kept in barracks 66, 64, 65 got maintained.",
        "A: They took, they sort of took care of them. I found out later. I didn't know that. And\nso the U.S. Army moved in and here we were.",
        "A: The Gls, yeah. Let me just --",
        "A: Okay.\n(Pause)",
        "A: They came in. There were mostly Jewish kids. And I understand, from what I heard\nand what I saw, was some non-Jewish kids too among the Jewish kids.",
        "A: And they took over. They fed us. Put us, really, back together to help and the really,\nwhoever with tuberculosis, with TB --",
        "A: -- was sent to Switzerland, to Sweden, to Germany into the mountains. And they took\na group of kids that the French government okayed it and they took us to France.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: One brother and -- there was about three sets of brothers the same way.",
        "A: . Yes.",
        "A: They took us by train.",
        "A: Yeah. When the U.S. Army moved in, they had a rabbi that came over and took the\nJewish kids. And some of them were non-Jewish. And they had a segment of the kids\nthat they sent to France, they sent them to Switzerland, to England. You know,\nwhichever country took them in.",
        "A: I end up in France.",
        "A: Well, the German authority were -- for instance, you know, I was sick. I came out of\nthe hospital and I was laying there on one of the bunks, so to speak, like a shelf.",
        "A: And there was a window and glass and I used to, I watched the main road. All ofa\nsudden I saw tanks moving up in that glass. It was like a mirror reflection in the glass.\nAnd I knew the U.S. Army is moving in. So when they came in, they took the kids. And\nthe rabbis, the priests, they gave them, you know --",
        "A: -- food. They gave them medicine. And some of them had to be hospitalized and they\nbrought us back sort of together.",
        "A: And, you know, back to health, so to speak. And they sorted out kids to go to France,\nit had to do with their health also, to England, and to some other countries, you know,\nthat they -- I don't know all the countries that the kids went to, so.",
        "A: But they spread them out. Each country took in so many kids, you know.",
        "A: The Germans had jumped off the towers --",
        "A: -- during that because -- the guard towers.",
        "A: And they started running.",
        "A: If the GIs came up on one of them, they killed them, you know.",
        "A: They were running away from the prison, period. And I guess, I don't know who they\ncaught, the main commandant was caught by the U.S. Army. The main people that were\ncaught, the same thing. They had sort of a mini revolution within that prison because\nthere were a lot of Germans that worked 1n that prison also that were there for many\nyears.",
        "A: Germans that were not Nazis.",
        "A: Political prisoners that were put in there.",
        "A: But they're the ones primarily that run that prison.",
        "A: Had access to armament. There was a munition factory --",
        "A: -- and an armament factory in one of the prisons down the road. And they had a man\nover there that worked in that prison, the munition factory. And one of them\nwas Leon Blum.",
        "A: I don't know whether he survived or not.",
        "A: But he was one of the people that was in that. But prison, the armament.",
        "A: And the U.S. Air Force bombed it. And after that, I don't know what happened to the\npeople.",
        "A: Yeah, they dispersed all the kids.",
        "A: They dispersed the kids.",
        "A: Some of them went into ;",
        "A: Others went into a religious home. They had -- they divided them, you know, in\ndifferent homes.",
        "A: Then they had, I want to say they had homes for the French kids also there. So they\nput them together.",
        "A: Jewish kids that had, you know, that survived the war.",
        "A: The French kids. One of my friends -- and the OSE took over. I don't know whether\nyou're familiar with the OSE.",
        "A: OSE was an organization that was from, I guess -- a French organization which took\ncare of the kids to make sure they go to school and some of them had trades and they paid\nfor the education.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: It was a Jewish organization.",
        "A: Primarily Jewish. I don't know whether it was totally Jewish. It was like --",
        "A: I don't know. It was initials O-S-E.",
        "A: They sent a friend of mine to school. He came to the United States and became a\nmillionaire.",
        "A: I went into a Jewish religious situation.",
        "A: Even though I wasn't religious, I went into that home.",
        "A: I don't know. I don't know what I was thinking. And I started going to school a little\nbit and then I returned to the United States in 1947.",
        "A: Almost.",
        "A: I would say a year and a half. April, in April, to be specific, April the 11th was my\nfreedom day in Buchenwald.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: My brother was with me and there were other two sets of brothers, one of the brothers\nof the father that they took out and disappeared.",
        "A: Yes, yes. He was with me all along.",
        "A: He was with me --",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Yeah. It wasn't a family. It was a home --",
        "A: -- for religious kids, I think donated by the Rothschild family --",
        "A: -- you know, for the kids to stay there.",
        "A: And they had Jewish religion, Jewish food, and Jewish upbringing, so to speak, you\nknow. And, like, again, like Elie Wiesel was there also with us.",
        "A: That's where I met him, right.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I went to French school. You know, it's been a long, long time. I still speak\nit but I'm a little rusty on it.",
        "A: It wasn't just like that. First of all, I don't know the time --",
        "A: -- you know, the time it took.",
        "A: After liberation, again, after a while, we went to Switzerland, went off. A Jewish\nserviceman, who was a rabbi, he saw to it that the French government, they picked out\ncertain kids that were, I guess, a little healthier then a lot of them --",
        "A: -- and, you know, designated for France. We were there for several\nmonths before we left for France.",
        "A: Yeah. I don't know about several months. Maybe a couple months. Three months.",
        "A: Just for a while.",
        "A: Again, the time wasn't important to me then.",
        "A: So then they picked kids to go, the sick kids, some of them went to Sweden.",
        "A: Some of them went to Switzerland that had TB so, you know, to get -- to recuperate.\nMyself and my brother and a whole bunch of other kids, I don't know how many it was,\nwe were designated to go to France. And when we came to France, we had doctors --",
        "A: -- that checked us over. And they placed us in sort of a vacation home in the country,\nwhich was also one of the Rothschilds' homes.",
        "A: Excuse me. And so we were there for a while. The time element, I just don't, couldn't\ntell you.",
        "A: Then we went back to Versailles. We went to Versailles, rather, back -- the first time.\nWe went to Versailles. And then they sent us to school, to public school. Some of them\nhad families, they found families in the U.S. Some of them found each other. We had\nFrench kids also for a while but very few of them, what we did have.",
        "A: Actually, I -- the truth of the matter, I was born in October.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The reason for August is this. I came to this country. The guy, the guy who had my\ncertificate that I had from the U.S. Army from, you know, from, Germany --",
        "A: -- read it as August.",
        "A: Because it's very similar. And he misread it.",
        "A: So I just let it go. I didn't want to change it. I changed the name but I didn't change\nthe date. It was a couple months. It didn't matter.",
        "A: October.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: So I left it, you know, for, you know, August.",
        "A: Yeah, August. I go by August.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, in April. We were freed in April.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: You know, I had here an uncle. And also an aunt.",
        "A: I didn't know much about the aunt.",
        "A: But my uncle, when he found me in the newspaper, he found the name in the\nnewspaper --",
        "A: -- wrote me a letter. He couldn't write nothing else but Yiddish.",
        "A: So he wrote me this letter and asked who my family 1s.",
        "A: It turned out that I was his sister's kids, me and my brother.",
        "A: My mother's brother was in the U.S.",
        "A: No. I knew she has a brother but I didn't know where and what. I didn't know even\nhow to go about it anyhow.",
        "A: There was -- he was illiterate. Excuse me just a minute. I need to cough.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Are you on again?",
        "A: Yeah. Okay. So he, he was -- I didn't know where he was but they told me\n. He was illiterate. Only he knew how to write in Yiddish.",
        "A: He came and found a job as a weaver. A weaver is people that make cloth",
        "A: And he worked for Botany 500, which is a famous company.",
        "A: Botany 500.",
        "A: Yes. They went out of business now.",
        "A: Because of the innovation of the mechanical, you know, that they have. The factories,\nyou know, they run it on electricity but -- so he worked for them for many, many years\nbecause at home he was trained as a weaver, weaving fabrics.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: Thank you. Yes.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A:",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, he didn't have money. He was a very poor man but had a soul. But he -- I don't\nknow where he went. I understand he went to the people that make matzo. And they\nsupposedly had signed papers for me and my brother. And the thing was, you know, we\ncommunicated at that time in Yiddish.",
        "A: Which I can still, I guess I can still write. But I don't use it. But at any rate, he -- I --\nhe sent me papers, immigration papers.",
        "A: The matzo company signed that I would be important in the government, which is a\nnormal thing for immigrants.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: They were official sponsor. So I got the papers and of course the people in France --",
        "A: -- made sure that everything goes smooth. We went to the American consulate, x-ray\ntaken, so on and so forth. And we got immigration papers. For whatever reason, they\nsaid that we have to hurry up and be in Sweden by such and such a date --",
        "A: -- getting on a ship to go to the U.S. So we got on a train and we went to Sweden, a\nwhole bunch of kids.",
        "A: I don't know how many.",
        "A: They put us on the ship, a Swedish ship.",
        "A: You know something? It kind of -- yes, I do but it slipped my mind.",
        "A: That ship was a troop ship during the war. That I know. In fact, I have probably a\npicture of it too.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: That was a ship ,",
        "A: It was, yeah, made into a troop ship or whatever.",
        "A: I don't know who it belonged to. It had the Swedish name.",
        "A: It was a Swedish ship.",
        "A: As far as I know.",
        "A: We got the papers. Put us on the train. And we came to Copenhagen.",
        "A: We went all through Germany, which was bombed out.",
        "A: We finally got to Copenhagen. And from Copenhagen we went to -- I guess by train.\nThe train. Got on the ship and took us across the waters and wound up in Gothenburg,\nSweden.",
        "A: Yeah. So in Gothenburg, we boarded the ship to the U.S. And I don't know how\nmany days it took. I don't remember. And believe it or not, we wound up in New York\nCity. The ship pulled up to dock. And it docked. And my uncle was supposed to come\nto getus. Well, he couldn't. We got off the ship. We don't have -- we have just clothes\nwhat we had on. We thought, well, when we get to the U.S., we'll buy new clothing.",
        "A: So we tossed most of the stuff in the ocean. And we got off the ship. My uncle isn't\nthere.",
        "A: That was the good question. The question was what do I do.",
        "A: But apparently he had enough sense to call one of the Jewish organizations in New\nYork. I can't remember which one. They came and picked us up after a while. And we\nspent some time there.",
        "A: New York City.",
        "A: No, no. My uncle lived in Paterson, New Jersey.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: So we went there and they gave us -- you know, I smoked so they gave us, they gave\nme cigarettes. Brought us some clothing, this organization. Was it HIAS?",
        "A: Or one of the organizations similar to HIAS. Or HIAS itself. And he came -- tried to\npick us up. They couldn't . My aunt had a heart attack and he couldn't come\nto get me.",
        "A: But I didn't know that. Nobody else knew it.",
        "A: I'm in New York City with my brother. I have five cents, I swear to you, five cents\nand I smoked no cigarettes.",
        "A: Here, I'm in New York City with my brother. I didn't know what to do. So luckily\nenough, he called this organization. Came, picked us up, kept us for a few days. And\nthey gave -- fed us. Gave us cigarettes to smoke. And my brother smoked. And he\nfinally came to get us. Well, we went to New Jersey. I discovered my uncle is very poor.",
        "A: He lived in this apartment in Paterson, New Jersey.",
        "A: And his wife was sick. What can we do. I couldn't stay with him.",
        "A: So he called another organization in Paterson, New Jersey, which they were absolutely\nterrific, the people were terrific, and found us an apartment, a room in somebody's house\nuntil we, you know -- and put us there. And I went out looking for a job.",
        "A: Nope, not a word. Some bad words that I listened to the GIs they used that I found out\nlater what it was.",
        "A: For work. And I didn't start school. My brother was young. hired from\nanybody, you know. We just stayed a while in New Jersey. And somebody came to\nwork that picked him up that lived in Los Banos, California. It was a cotton -- a Jewish\nguy, who was an American. He owned a cotton farm. And he was going to take him and\neducate him, you know.",
        "A: Clear across the country. And myself, I went to school. Tried to learn English. And\nof course I met some people and, you know, so on and so forth. And I learned a little at a\ntime and I started going to school, you know. So my brother finally, he got upset about\nsomething. He never told me what it was.",
        "A: And he came back. And I moved, I moved to Los Angeles. I couldn't stay with my\nuncle --",
        "A: -- because he didn't have time. He couldn't do anything for me.",
        "A: I couldn't do anything for him.",
        "A: And New Jersey wasn't the place because I was a young man at that time. I was going\nto date and all that.",
        "A: And people talked about me in the town. Everybody knew me. I was in the\nnewspaper.",
        "A: Yes. In fact, you might have a picture of me and my brother.",
        "A: Paterson Evening News.",
        "A: Yes. You probably have a picture of it.",
        "A: I think I gave it to you guys.",
        "A: If not, I'll send you a copy also.",
        "A: So --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think you grow up fast. I had a responsibility to my brother.",
        "A: And he was really little, skinny and little.",
        "A: So if because of the war, he's that little, the nourishment --",
        "A: -- or by genes, but he didn't grow too tall.",
        "A: And, you know, I wanted him to go to school. He was smart. And I would be going\nto work, you know, and just keep him in school.",
        "A: It turn out that this man came to pick him up.",
        "A: And offered to give him an education. And, you know, and he went to Los Banos,\nCalifornia. You know, I wasn't very happy in New Jersey because I was of age but I was\ntrying to date.",
        "A: And everybody knew me in town. Wherever I went, everybody knew me. Wherever\nI'd go --",
        "A: -- the whole town knew.",
        "A: And I got to ajob. I worked for a man who was from Belgium. And one of the\nreasons he hired me, because I spoke French. So, you know, I had a job for a while and I\ndecided New Jersey, Paterson, New Jersey, is not going to be for me because the people,\neverybody knew me in town. And I couldn't go out with anybody because everybody\nknew it.",
        "A: So I had to behave.",
        "A: I had to behave.",
        "A: So I left New Jersey and went to California. I had $50 in my pocket. I bought a\nticket.",
        "A: On a bus.",
        "A: And I traveled to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, my uncle had a stepson that lived in\nLos Angeles. So I got in touch with him. And he gave me a place to stay. And I kept\ngoing to school. I went to high school, going to school, kept going, because I wanted to\nlearn the language, get some education, get some knowledge.",
        "A: And I kept going until about 1947.",
        "A: Lo and behold, the Korean War broke out. And me and my brother, who had left the\nUnited States and went to Israel, you know -- I forgot this part.",
        "A: He went to Israel and he couldn't get a job. Joined the army.",
        "A: No. No, no. He went afterwards, after I came here.",
        "A: here. So the war was over and independence was in the works.",
        "A: So he joined the army. He didn't tell me where he was and I didn't tell him where I\nwent, you know, because I didn't want him to worry.",
        "A: And so later on, he told me he was in the army. He was on the border not too far way.\nBecause Israel's not that big. Everywhere's a border.",
        "A: So, anyhow, this is where he was in the army. I knew he was in the army but I, you\nknow, I didn't tell him I was in the --",
        "A: The Korean War broke out in 1950.",
        "A: Well, I get a drafts notice. My brother gets a drafts notice. I went out to the drafts\nboard and says my brother's not here. When is he coming back. Probably not.",
        "A: He comes back to register with the drafts. But anyhow, I registered with the drafts\nboard in New Jersey. I had to follow up here to register. And I got a notice, a drafts\nnotice. Well, again, I was going to school and I had to break the school and I was drafted\ninto the service, in the army.",
        "A: I -- no, I wasn't directly involved in the fight because I was the guy behind the lines\nwith the artillery.",
        "A: So, you know, I spent some time in Japan, at Okinawa and so on, in the Korean War",
        "A: Oh. Can you hear me now better?",
        "A: Okay. So I was in the, a very little town in Korea. And mostly I spent time on\nOkinawa, Japan, very little time, and came home and went back to school.",
        "A: Back to school.",
        "A: Well, I didn't -- don't have much of college.",
        "A: College, maybe six months.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, you know, I had to support myself.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I got a job. I started working and, you know, and quit college.",
        "A: And tried to support myself. And I met somebody and I got married.",
        "A: My ex-wife.",
        "A: My ex-wife, unfortunately.",
        "A: But I had four kids with her.",
        "A: Four children.",
        "A: Lisa is second in line.",
        "A: The second oldest.",
        "A: One boy and three girls.",
        "A: The irony of this, I don't know whether you know anything about Lisa --",
        "A: -- Lisa was a baby. She contracted spinal meningitis.",
        "A: And almost died.",
        "A: She went to the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. Because it's a contagious disease.",
        "A: And she came back, although it affected her hearing. And she had a hard time to go to\nschool, go to high school.",
        "A: And I used to go to the high school and talk to the teacher and I got so angry, I was\ngoing to kill her. She was ,",
        "A: Sure.\n(Pause)",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, one of the reasons, you know ,",
        "A: When somebody loves somebody --",
        "A: -- you don't want to -- you don't want them to know your agony, your past.",
        "A: You know, you kind of protect them.",
        "A: So I never talked about tt.",
        "A: No. My ex-wife, you know --",
        "A: They had meetings, kids, you know, people from Europe.",
        "A: You know, we had gatherings or whatever; she would never go to any of those.",
        "A: Oh, yes, yes. You know, I didn't want them to know the agony I had been through.",
        "A: Yes, it did.",
        "A: Well, I was prompted by Lisa, by the kids --",
        "A: -- to tell my story, to let people know --",
        "A: -- about you. You know, we didn't know about you. So all of a sudden they had\ninterest in me and my life and my past. Before that, you know, nobody ever -- I never\ntalked about it. They know that -- where I came from.",
        "A: But we never talked about anything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were already grown up.",
        "A: In fact, yes, I do, quite a few of them.",
        "A: They are. They are. But, you see, I have -- my wife wound up marrying somebody\nwho's not Jewish.",
        "A: My kids, for the most part, they're not Jewish.",
        "A: So I don't have -- you know, what I mean? It's --",
        "A: It's sort of --",
        "A: -- a different situation here. Who are you going to talk to.",
        "A: Well, we talked very little about 1t because we both went through the same thing so,\nyou know, there was really not a lot to talk about.",
        "A: You know, we just kept it in. And my brother in particular, he wouldn't talk about\nanything, you see.",
        "A: I finally started talking and, you know, and started telling and -- but he didn't. He\ndidn't want to.",
        "A: Change me?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, it didn't change. They have sympathy or -- what is the other word. I don't\nremember the word but they have, they were sympathetic to what I went through. They\nwanted to know more about it when they got older.",
        "A: And, well, when you go through, I guess, a marriage, I wound up broke after so many\nyears --",
        "A: -- what do you do. I couldn't take them where I wanted to take them.",
        "A: So Lisa suggested let's do this and this and this. And I did.",
        "A: I went back with Lisa one time, Lisa and my son. Then I went back another time to\nPoland. It was my granddaughter -- no, grandson, rather, and my son and Lisa and I.",
        "A: I went back to my hometown. I showed them where I lived. It's so often that the\nnight was -- we got there late in the afternoon. I couldn't show them the main town. We\nshowed them the area where the ghetto was was still fenced up, sort of. And I guess -- I\ndon't think anybody's living there now --",
        "A: -- after so many years. And so we went through the killing camps. The first one,\nwhich was Blechhammer, Gross-Rosen, and Buchenwald. So there was not -- you go\nthrough this and you really don't see what really happened.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: It did make an impression, mostly Lisa.",
        "A: My son, I don't really know whether it made that much of an impression.",
        "A: My hometown, if I could have disappeared when I was a baby, I would have.",
        "A: That's how I felt about my hometown, so.",
        "A: But there was nothing there, you know.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: To my own family members. You know, there's another situation, that some people\nthat project themselves, that did well --",
        "A: -- [happen to know one or two, that did well financially and they try to project\nthemselves as the people that it happened to. So they want to write a book and they want\nto do this, they want to do that. And everybody else 1s left behind. So they do that and\nthey come in the forefront of all this.",
        "A: And they went to schools right here in --",
        "A: -- you know, and teach in schools, you know . Unfortunately, the way I\nsee it, some of these people that go to the school and teaching of what happened --",
        "A: -- don't tell them the whole story. They make up some of the stuff.",
        "A: You remember things differently but also this guy, this person is in the forefront.",
        "A: He wrote a book. He's pushing himself. Like he went to see the governor and",
        "A: Pushing themselves out in front.",
        "A: And you're kind of left behind if you're a little reserved, you know.",
        "A: And so people call him. You know, they know that, so. I don't know. I just --",
        "A: Yes, I did. In fact, there was a man here that was in the newspaper business -- not in\nthe newspaper business. He worked for the newspaper.",
        "A: He worked for the newspaper.",
        "A: He came to me and asked me because what happened in Buchenwald itself --",
        "A: -- [have seen -- first, if you're a kid, you move around.",
        "A: They have a, they had a -- I don't know how you say it in English.",
        "A: They have a quarry, rather --",
        "A: -- that they were getting stones. I don't know for what purpose. Probably for making\ncement or whatever. And they buried artifacts. And what I mean, artifacts, what I have\nseen is primarily jewelry, cases and cases and cases of jewelry that, military trucks that\ndrove up and they loaded all that stuff up and . And they had GIs with\nmachine guns guarding all this.",
        "A: At Buchenwald. And I told him the story. And he was going to write. And his bosses\nsaid you can't do that because you'd be accusing the government. It disappeared.\nNobody knows where it's at. It disappeared. What that was . Nobody knows\nwhy. And, you know, he says do you have any witnesses. Yeah. I called up. They\nprobably have their story too, you know, the Kaleckshtaund (phonetic) in New York.",
        "A: We had one in France, a couple brothers from my hometown with me.\nThey witnessed that. They told them. There are a couple of other people that I met that\nwere there at the same time I was, you know. And that didn't do it. He says the\ngovernment would be accused of what.",
        "A: I got to tell you, people went over there after they left and they found all kinds of stuff\nburied in the ground because they stepped on it.",
        "A: Whole cases opened.",
        "A: On the site of Buchenwald in the quarry.",
        "A: And knowing what I knew after the war --",
        "A: -- what they did is they took five prisoners or ten prisoners to dig these tunnels, you\nknow, to bury that.",
        "A: And then they shot them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Before the war ended. During the war.",
        "A: We were still prisoners. They dug these tunnels and they killed them.",
        "A: So there would be no witnesses. The guards who came forward and said, told the\nstory was a German --",
        "A: -- that -- who saw what happened. So they started digging and they found all this.\nAnd the little reporter, he didn't want to write it because you're accusing the government\nof hiding things or stealing things. He says you can't do that.",
        "A: The newspaper man.",
        "A: Never went anywhere. So --",
        "A: You know, I tell you, my mother was an angel.",
        "A: And my mother, when she said that, I have never forgotten what she said to me.",
        "A: And she said to me, go save yourself. Then I tell her I can die alone.",
        "A: I'm very appreciative.",
        "A: I don't know what to think of. Well --",
        "A: You can't.",
        "A: Well, you know, I'm going to add a few things.",
        "A: I don't know whether you can put it in perspective or not. But, you know, they used to\ntake people and hang them to teach the people a lesson. If you do this, the same thing is\ngoing to happen. And people started making noises. So they had machine guns in the\ntowers and they started firing, you know.",
        "A: Not the dying people. The dying people were hanging. They couldn't make noises.\nThey were just swinging. But they just, they had guards on the towers --",
        "A: -- that the prisoners started making noises, anything at all, some movement, they fired\nright in the crowd, into the prisoners.",
        "A: Oh, of course not. You know, they took you out and they did what they call",
        "A: And you had to watch it, you know, the hanging, you know. You just couldn't stay in\nthe barracks. You had to watch the whole episode. And this 15-year-old kid that worked\nwith me and smoked cigarettes and they caught him doing it, even though I did also, he\nwouldn't tell them that and they hung him.",
        "A: A French kid.",
        "A: Right. And, you know, nearby there was some English prisoners of war. And we\nused to encounter them when we walked to work. You know, sometimes we walked the\nopposite direction.",
        "A: And, anyways, in that place --",
        "A: -- we end up -- we used to hike. We were in an open, open field in the open area and\nthey bombed the hell out of it. And they came very frequently because of the fact that\nthey produced oil, fuel --",
        "A: -- out of coal. They extracted fuel.",
        "A:",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, so when they bombed the place, you had no place to go. And we were in\nthe open. For some reason or another, I walked in through one of the bunkers that they\nbuilt, that we built for them.",
        "A: They had -- I went in there and for whatever reason they didn't kick me out, this one\npart.",
        "A: And they bombed the hell out of it. You know, they -- it just choked. They couldn't\npenetrate. It didn't kill anybody except a piece of cement fell on some person there that\nkilled them.",
        "A: No. I was afraid. I was afraid for my life. I'd run into -- one time during an air raid, I\nwent into a shack --",
        "A: -- you know, that had a shed on top of it. And basically people do that for shrapnels.\nThe debris starts falling when the bomb explodes.",
        "A: And they buried all the -- the whole -- there were about ten people there. And we\nwere all buried. Fortunately enough, another bomb dropped nearby and uncovered us\nand we found each other right on top of one other.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: No. I hope it never happen again.",
        "A: Well, excuse me one second.",
        "A: I only want to add one thing.",
        "A: I want to go back in time.",
        "A: whole thing. But this man that they shot that I told you, they took us out,\nan old man.",
        "A: The father.",
        "A: The father they shot.",
        "A: They had me out there. And for whatever reason, you know -- we were against the\nwall. For whatever reason, he just couldn't do it. And they told me that --",
        "A: In the ghetto. When the ghetto was closing.",
        "A: It could have been a Pole also.",
        "A: Or a German. I don't know who they were, you know. It wasn't the SS.",
        "A: I think they were SA people. You know what they are, right, I'm sure?",
        "A: SA.",
        "A: Okay. The SS people.",
        "A: SA. They are the ones who did the shooting.",
        "A: So anyhow, I didn't have to go for burial. You know, I don't know what they did.\nThere were about 19, 20 people there that were killed that day -- that night.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I know you probably had a burden on you, you know. people.",
        "A: Thank you.\nRibons, let me know what it is that you wanted to add to what you originally talked to us\nabout.",
        "A: I am not sure that I gave the interview on the subject of a march from Blechhammer\nto Gross-Rosen.",
        "A: Well, the Russian Army came close, took over just about all of Poland.",
        "A: And you can hear the rifle shots, and the Germans took out the whole tent, with the\nexception of some very sick people that were left there. And we start walking. We didn't\nknow where we were going or nothing.",
        "A: This was Blechhammer.",
        "A: So from Blechhammer we walked. And every second night or every night, if I\nremember right, they took us to a farm. And we slept outside in the barns, where they\nhad the cows and the pigs, and you know, the prisoners went there to sleep.",
        "A: What time of year?",
        "A: January.",
        "A: Yes. I think it was the month of January.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: It was difficult to walk. Mainly, we walk on the main streets, where the German\nArmy started retreating. We walked alongside the ravine, so to speak, you know,\nalongside that main street. And there were guns, but the Russians machine gun the area\nwhere the Germans were walking. And occasionally, they hit us as we were walking.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: The Russian Air Force was flying overhead and had machine guns, primarily, aimed\nat the Germans. So they had German guards with machine guns watching us. So they\nkind of machine gunned along the line of the prisoners.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Correct. So occasionally, they killed some prisoners. I don't think they could have\nhelped it. They were aiming at the guards, primarily, and they carried guns, machine\nguns and rifles and so on to watch the prisoners. And we walked. Probably every night\nwe stopped. We slept outside in the snow. And on a Sunday, we wound up in a barn\nwith the cows and pigs.",
        "A: In -- very skimpy, in the prisoners' uniforms that we wore. Myself, personally, I had\na -- I happened to have a sweater somehow. I don't remember how I got it. And I wore\nthat sweater. And I also wore bags, you know, the empty bags of cement as protection to\nkeep warm.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.",
        "A: Myself, I had a pair of boots somehow I got, and there were no soles on them.",
        "A: So you know, they were very skimpy. It was actually -- you know, we got all wet.\nMy feet got all wet. And well, I didn't have any shoes. So I wrapped, you know, some of\nthe stuff, my feet in cloth, that I could find or whatever I could get, you know, so my feet\nwouldn't freeze.",
        "A: No. We actually walked not on the outside of the road, because it was impossible to\nwalk, but we walked on the main road to the side.",
        "A: And you know, on one side of the street. And as we were walking, the Russians, I\ndon't know if willingly or not, the machine gun, primarily, they tried to machine gun the\nguards.",
        "A: And of course, the guards moved in among the prisoners. So you know, I guess they\nmust have hit some prisoners.",
        "A: With the prisoners, correct.",
        "A: No, it was a lot of guards. Again, they carried machine guns. However, you know,\nthe roads were full of people going west, because the Russians were right behind us. So\nwe could hear rifle shots from time to time. So they were very, very close behind us.",
        "A: One Sunday, we ended up in a barn. I don't know where that was. And they gave us\ncoffee. And they were shooting, practicing, I guess, either that or shooting at the legs of\nthe prisoners. So of course, they fell, and us, we left them there.",
        "A: The Germans.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, we were getting coffee from that big -- what do you call it -- pot, and they were\ngiving the prisoners coffee. Well, the prisoners did, but the Germans are the ones that\nallowed that to happen, the coffee pot.",
        "A: And as we got the coffee, they were shooting at the legs of the prisoners.",
        "A: So when that happened, of course, they fell. They couldn't stand up.",
        "A: And we had to leave them behind. And I am sure -- I personally didn't see it, but I'm\nsure they killed them after they left.",
        "A: Oh, yes, many, many people. They were actually froze to death. We had to sleep in\nthe snow. Occasionally, on a Sunday -- we walked about three Sundays, and I was able,\nwith my brother and some other kids, get into a barn with the cows and the pigs, you\nknow, and keep warm, you know.",
        "A: I believe it was three Sundays.",
        "A: Three weeks.",
        "A: About two to three weeks. And again, I don't know how many prisoners died during\nthat march.",
        "A: I mean, it must have been an enormous amount of prisoners that passed on. I try to --\nI'm sorry.",
        "A: That's correct. We fought for our lives, literally.",
        "A: And I was fortunate. I was able to make it. I tried to help a man that I knew in\nprison. He was from France. And his name was Ribak.",
        "A: R-I-B-A-C or B-A-K. I don't know how he spelled it.",
        "A: No, no. R -- Ribak.",
        "A: R-I-B, yes. And I helped him as much as I could, and then I finally gave up. I\ncouldn't do it any longer, and --",
        "A: By helping him walk. Yes, by helping him walk. I mean, I knew him in prison. We\noccasionally worked side by side, you know, so.",
        "A: Probably. I didn't have the stamina. I wouldn't know where to go.",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: We were in Germany at the time, so.",
        "A: Oh, yes, there were civilians. There were people with push carts and their\nbelongings. There were all kinds of people that walked, because they were trying to\navoid the Russians, you know, particularly if they were Germans, you know.",
        "A: Yes, it was, absolutely. And we had Russian prisoners, and you know, all kinds of\nprisoners walked alongside of us. The road wasn't big enough for all of these people that\nwalked, including the German Army.",
        "A: I believe they were wider than that. I'm not sure, you know. Again, we were\nfighting for our lives. We didn't pay attention too much of what was going on around us,\nexcept, you know, we tried to hide from the bullets.",
        "A: You know, and we didn't know they were Russian planes until they came down real\nlow.",
        "A: So it was chaos, absolutely chaos.",
        "A: And it was a 250-mile stretch. And I took my daughter and my son and my grandson\non that stretch from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen in a van.",
        "A: Just recently about a year ago.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: The whole trip, yes, the whole trip. From my hometown where I was born to the trip,\nall the way to Gross-Rosen and from Gross-Rosen to Buchenwald.",
        "A: From Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen was about a 250-mile stretch. At least, I didn't\nknow. My daughter told me that it was that distance.",
        "A: By van, I don't know, about eight hours, ten hours. I'm not sure. I didn't even think\nof paying attention to that, you know.",
        "A: I drove with my daughter, my grandson and my son.",
        "A: No, no, no. It was totally changed, because they -- first of all, you know, with so\nmuch chaos, you didn't even pay attention to anything, except, you know, you try to\nsurvive. You know, the food was very scarce. I was in one of the areas where you ate in\none of the farms that we walked in. I saw a house, people, that the farmer, I guess, lived\nin. And I run to the farmer, knocked on their door asking for food, for bread. And the\ncommander, so to speak, the person in charge of the prisoners, he said, What are you\ndoing here, in German. And I said, I would like to have something to eat. So that young\nwoman -- it was a young woman. He said, he says, you can give him bread, provided that\nyou sleep with me tonight.",
        "A: So she says okay. And she gave me a loaf of bread. And when I went out, I got hit\nover my back with a cane. And I went to my brother, and I gave him half of the bread.\nWe ate that just one night, you know.",
        "A: It's much crueler than anybody can even anticipate.",
        "A: Well, I would imagine, you know, it happens all over, even today.",
        "A: So the cruelest animal on earth is the human being.",
        "A: So anyhow, then we got to Gross-Rosen. We were there for several days. We were\npacked like sardines. And we had just a bowl of soup during the day. And I don't\nremember whether we got bread or not. We were there for almost about a week. And\nthat was Gross-Rosen. And Gross-Rosen was very secluded, because they had -- they\nwere mining marble in that area. So the people on the outside couldn't see what was\ngoing on there in that -- in Gross-Rosen. And you know, after five days or so, a week\nmaybe, maybe longer, they loaded up -- they loaded us up on the freight trains. They\nwere going and taking the marble to market, I guess. And they loaded up the prisoners\non these open freight trains, and they took us. We didn't know where we were going, and\nwith guards on them. Each car had two guards with machine guns or regular guns. I'm\nnot sure what. At that time, I wasn't really familiar with the weapons.",
        "A: Right. So they -- when they loaded us up, we were on the way. And we got all the\nway to Weimar where we were bombed. I think the allied's air force made a mistake and\ndidn't know who it was, because they did see guards watching these things, you know,\nand they bombed the train. A lot of Germans, the guards, including the prisoners, were\nkilled, a lot of them.",
        "A: This was allied bombing. I don't know what air force that was there.",
        "A: But primarily, I think the U.S. Air Force was in that area, or the U.S. Army was in\nthat area, you know, so.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, we made it into Buchenwald. They took us to Buchenwald, and I --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: To my knowledge, the railroad into Buchenwald, the railroad tracks, to my\nknowledge, if I remember right, were bombed out. So they took us by truck.",
        "A: Into Buchenwald. It was not all that far.",
        "A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war. Because Buchenwald 1s in the\nmountains, and this is below the mountain. So from there, we were there, I don't know,\nfrom January until April.",
        "A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks. It had three -- I think\nthey had three or four barracks where they kept just children. And I guess, there was a\nwhole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were\nprisoners.",
        "A: Right. So they sort of protected, to my knowledge, the kids. And at the time that\nthey tried to take the kids out, we went to this appellplatz, and you know, we all lined up.\nAnd then they took us back to the barracks. What happened in the interim, I don't know.\nI guess they had -- they had, within the prison, you know, people that carried guns. In\nfact, outside of Buchenwald, there was an ammunition factory.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, the Germans were in control. However, there also, since the factory where\nmost of the German prisoners worked, and the other prisoners, I don't know which one of\nthe prisoners they kept work in the ammunition factory, they smuggled in a lot of arms,\nthe Germans.",
        "A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison. So I guess,\nthe Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian\nprisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans.",
        "A: German political prisoners that smuggled in arms.",
        "A: Inthe ammunitions factory.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes.",
        "A: Not patrol, but they watched. As soon as the Germans left, they took over.",
        "A: Yes, these political prisoners came out and tried to help -- they were not just\nGermans. They were all kinds of prisoners. There were Swedes, and they had Danes. I\ndon't know where -- the Danes I can understand, but I don't understand the Swedes, how\nthey got there.",
        "A: Right. I don't know how they got there, but they had them there. So and the reason I\nknow that to be a fact is because I was hospitalized. I had extreme diarrhea that they -- I\nbegged them to take me away already. I couldn't take it anymore.",
        "A: Right. So --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. In Buchenwald, we didn't work.",
        "A: At least the time, the period of time that I was there.",
        "A: You know, there were deaths all over. People cut out the innards of the dead and ate,\nyou know. This is the kind of stuff that I saw. It was a matter of either dying or doing\nthat, so.",
        "A: No, no. I think it was -- I can't think of the general's name that came in. Let me kind\nof put a little emphasis on the whole situation, the whole picture there.",
        "A: They had a -- if I can remember the town -- Erfurt.",
        "A: It was in the mountains, across the mountains. You could see from Buchenwald all\nthe way into the mountains of Erfurt. They had a battle going on in Erfurt. At night, we\nused to see the cannons going off, the artillery going off at night from Erfurt, because it\nlit up. So the general who was the tank commander, and I can't remember his name. My\nmemory 1s not like it used to be.",
        "A: Well, he got killed in Germany in a car crash or something. I'm not sure how he\ndied, the general.",
        "A: He was in charge of the tank unit that came into Buchenwald.",
        "A: Yes. There was just a tank came in with a couple -- they opened the turret, and they\npeaked out. And the Germans were already gone. They jumped off the guard towers,\nand the prisoners were chasing them. You know, so they caught some. You know, it was\nall chaos, you know.",
        "A: They killed some, you know, and they brought some back to prison. So they -- the\nGermans were gone.",
        "A: The army came in and -- the American Army came in, and of course, they start\ngiving us food, you know, rations and stuff like that. And then organizations came in\nfrom western Europe that fed us after a while. So but as a whole, Erfurt, they were there\nfor about a week or maybe more. They were shooting at the Germans across the\nmountains, and you could see it. At night, you could see it.",
        "A: The tank, yeah, with the people in it, opened the turret and looked out.",
        "A: You know, I don't recall that.",
        "A: I don't recall if they got out or were in the tanks.",
        "A: We kind of roamed around, because there was nobody there to keep us anywhere,\nyou know, because the Germans were already gone. I saw the Germans -- you know, I\nused to sleep on the top bunk. It was three high.",
        "A: And the top bunk, I could look out the window. You know, what it is was glass, and\nwhen I got the window in a certain position, we could see the main road.",
        "A: Right. So they -- because we were on top of a mountain.",
        "A: Right. So we looked in there, and I saw the tanks, the Germans running and\nGermans jumping off the towers. And it was just like a movie scene of some sort. So\nthis 1s what I saw through that window. And I was kind of -- you know, because they\nwere shooting into the barracks. So we got to the ground on the floor, and we just waited\nit out, you know.",
        "A: Yes. They had, some of the people, I don't know what rank they were, what capacity\nthey were, the Germans, they took them in to where they held the prisoners, the\nBuchenwald prisoners, you know, that they tortured them there. And they took the\nGermans, and they gave us two hours for people to go in and beat them up.",
        "A: So--",
        "A: Well, you know, you punch the guy. How much revenge can you take, you know,\nSO.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Correct.\nQ. Were you still there when that happened?",
        "A: Yeah. That was in the beginning, you know, because we were there several weeks\nafter.",
        "A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. But you know, because first of all, the army\nkept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in.",
        "A: We saw them in the distance. We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact\nthat, you know, revenge would have taken place. And in the U.S., don't take revenge on\nother people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other\npeople.",
        "A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever.",
        "A: Well, you couldn't help some violence.",
        "A: Because the prison -- the wires were all torn down. You could go out through the\nwires anywhere you wanted to go. I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat,\nyou know, in the beginning.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I think they had so much fear in them, that 1t was beyond belief.\nYou know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town. He was made\nmayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. I\ndon't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. I walked into the mayor's\nhouse, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike. He says, no problem. He gave me\nan address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike. And of course, the bikes were\nall hidden. You couldn't find them. So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm\nsaying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. And\nin fact, some of them were.",
        "A: By the Russian prisoners, you know, the ones that were older, not the youngsters,\nyou know.",
        "A: No. They didn't have it. It was all empty.",
        "A: All the barns were empty. Everything was empty. You know, so I didn't get a bike.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. Somehow or another, we got right through the fence. The fence was\ntorn apart, and we just walked out. And we went to the nearby towns. I went a couple of\ntimes to Weimar.",
        "A: We didn't have anything else, really. Just a prisoner's uniform.",
        "A: Fear.",
        "A: Some of them were beaten up by others, by the prisoners. So, you know, I was a kid\nincapable of doing anything, too weak.",
        "A: SO.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I saw it, saw them being beaten up, and they were beaten up when they\nbrought the Germans in. I don't know whether it was soldiers or civilians that were\nbrought in, and kept them where they used to torture the prisoners. They kept them there.\nAnd they used to let them in at, let's say, 3:00 in the afternoon for a half hour to beat the\nhell out of them, you know. But you know.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: They had some too.",
        "A: But they watched how much beating they could get, you know. They wouldn't\nallow, even though that person had seen about 19 Germans being shot, you know,\nsoldiers.",
        "A: And I couldn't tell you who shot them. I know they wore military uniforms, but\nwhether there were civilians in the uniforms or American or any other nationality that\nshot him, you know, so.",
        "A: Iwas born in 1927. This was '45.",
        "A: Yes. You know, we were used to seeing all kinds of stuff.",
        "A: Ihave seen dogs chasing the prisoners and eat them up alive, you know, kill them\nand eat them. You know, it was not something -- or people being hung, for whatever\nreason that they found, you know. So it was not something that --",
        "A: -- I hadn't seen before. It wasn't new.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I, myself, were under a gun once or twice, you know, but I -- they let me go.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: This was still in the ghetto.",
        "A: It wasn't really that long. There was a -- you know, I didn't know, because I didn't --\nthere was a rabbi, I suppose. He was an American chaplain that worked on taking the\nkids out of Buchenwald. And I guess, each government, to my knowledge, I found out\nlater, let in so many kids. And some kids, I understand, went to Cuba. Some kids went\nto England. Some went to Switzerland, and they went to France, they went to Belgium.\nIt depended on the government how many kids they would allow in, into the country.",
        "A: I was amongst that group that went to France.",
        "A: They took us, if I -- if my memory 1s right, to a home that the Rothschild family\nowned.",
        "A: And they gave the home, I guess, to use for the kids for the summer. I don't know.\nThey had their hires in France to take care of all the kids. To what capacity, I have no\nidea. They gave us a home. They gave us food. They gave us schooling, you know.",
        "A: They sent us to school, you know. So it was a variety of things, and I don't know\nwho was what.",
        "A: You know, like for instance, my friend, Elie Wiesel, look what happened to him. He\nwent to the Sorbonne in Paris.",
        "A: You know, the guy that was also his friend, my hometown friend, a fellow by the\nname of Gallenstein (ph.), he went also to the Sorbonne, because they were geniuses.\nThey were geniuses, these guys. And I don't know who else. And they sent them to trade\nschools, and they sent them to different things. I came to the United States early enough,\nyou know, right past -- it wasn't that long after that, about a year, year and a half maybe.",
        "A: The date exactly --",
        "A: Yes, I do, but I have it written down.",
        "A: Yes, Ido have it. I have it written down. I used to know, but I don't know now.",
        "A: At the moment, I cannot remember.",
        "A: No, we came -- we went to -- from France, they took us to Sweden. We came from\nSweden across the SS Gripsholm, which used to be a cruise ship in War World II. It was\nreconverted into a passenger ship. And they brought us into New York. There was a lot\nof other people. There were a lot of Russian immigrants and all kinds of stuff, all kinds\nof people that were on that ship. And we came to New York. When I came here, they\ndidn't have Ellis Island anymore.",
        "A: Well, I had an uncle in New Jersey. My uncle, supposedly, was going to come and\npick me up.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: So the hirers, I believe, came to pick us up and kept us there for a few days.\nEuropean experiences that you want to add, or do you think we pretty much touched it?",
        "A: Yes. We covered this. When we were in the ghetto.",
        "A: And they took all the Jewish people out.",
        "A: My hometown ghetto, when they took out all the Jewish people, the transportation to\ntake us to the next town, big town, was by horse and buggy.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: They wouldn't spend money for gas to take the Jews across a couple of towns down.",
        "A: So how long we traveled on that, you know, with the horse and buggy, I don't know.\nI can't really remember.",
        "A: Oh, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "A: My mother and my sister and my cousin, you know, my grandmother, we were all on\nthat horse and buggy thing.\ndo this again, by the way. If there is something that comes up that you have forgotten,\nwe can always make an appointment to talk again for a brief moment and then record\nthat.",
        "A: The march was very important because a lot of people died. I don't know how many.\nHundreds and hundreds of people died.",
        "A: From Weimar going to Gross-Rosen.",
        "A: Because they'd shoot them. They'd shoot them in the legs. And when they did that,\nthey couldn't walk. And when we left, they shot them.",
        "A: Or left them dead to die, either one of the two.",
        "A: And I've seen many kids my age, their legs were frozen. The flesh was peeling off\ntheir legs.",
        "A: So I mean, it's --",
        "A: They had women. There were no girls. They had women that they kept for\nprostitution there in Blechhammer.",
        "A: So these were the women that they kept, that many came with us.",
        "A: And then they parted company. Where, I don't know.",
        "A: Incidentally, another thing I need -- I don't need, but I'll tell you.",
        "A: Icame to Paris.",
        "A: And Iwas roaming the streets, you know. We were kids and curious or whatever. I\nran into a young girl that looked very familiar. Because the guy that I dragged to help\nwalk --",
        "A: Mr. Ribak.",
        "A: Showed me pictures from his family. And he said his wife and his kids -- I don't\nknow if he had one child or not -- showed me pictures of them --",
        "A: -- being in Paris.",
        "A: AndI came to Paris. And now, you know, we were roaming the streets, and I see a\ngirl, a young girl that looks familiar. Well, I walked over to her.",
        "A: Believe it or not, it turned out to be this guy's daughter.",
        "A: I swear on my life.",
        "A: lapparently remembered from the picture what she looked like. I suppose this 1s\nwhat happened. And I asked her the last name. She told me the name is Ribak. And the\nfirst thing I said, is your dad alive. She says, yes.",
        "A: He made it. She took me over to their house.",
        "A: Isaw this guy Ribak, and it was really something.",
        "A: And if I could remember that from a picture, it's really something. I don't know. She\nlooked just like him.",
        "A: No, I really didn't talk about it.\nA. I didn't talk about it. I saw him, and I was so happy to see him, and I met his family.\nI don't remember if I met his wife, but I did meet his daughter. I saw her on the street.\nShe was going somewhere, you know.",
        "A: No. No, I didn't.",
        "A: I think I was busy with myself, you know.",
        "A: My own life and trying to put my life and my brother's life together.",
        "A: So anyhow, I told you about the story, I was drafted into the army here.",
        "A: Soon and so forth. Now I cannot recall. There was something else I wanted to tell\nyou. And I, for the life of me, I'm trying to remember.",
        "A: Hold on just a second. I wrote something down.",
        "A: Let me see what I -- let's see. The march from Gross-Rosen -- to Gross-Rosen, the\nfreight train, which you are aware of. People froze or got shot or whatever.",
        "A: And let's see. I just told you about the frozen limbs.",
        "A: The legs and whatnot.",
        "A: Unfortunately, these kids were my age, you know.",
        "A: That's all, really that I had written down.",
        "A: Oh, yes. When I was in that hospital.",
        "A: My brother --",
        "A: No, this hospital is in Buchenwald.",
        "A: Yes, right. And we used to get two slices of bread a day in rations when I was in the\nbarracks before I got sick. And my brother saved -- collected my rations and saved as\nmuch as a whole loaf of bread, a loaf wasn't that big, but 1t was a loaf of bread that he\nsaved for me when I got back. And he put his life in jeopardy.",
        "A: And you know, of course I shared the bread with him later. But when I got back,\nwhen we were still in prison, he had saved a whole loaf of bread.",
        "A: In fact, when he passed away, I talked about that to the people that were there, so.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Thank you very much for listening to me again.",
        "A: Well, I do have tears in my eyes.",
        "A: Thank you. I never had the nerve to do that, to be quite honest with you.",
        "A: I did tell you about my Army life, didn't I?",
        "A: Yeah, I think I did.\n"
