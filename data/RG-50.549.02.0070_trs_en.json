        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Boleslaw Brodecki, conducted by Nina Ellis, on July 26\",\n2003, in Richmond, Virginia. This interview 1s part of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and it\u2019s a follow up to an\ninterview -- videotaped interview conducted with Boleslaw Brodecki in 1989. The\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby\nHerr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. I -- I saw\nyour video interview recently, and it ended with you and Sonia coming to the United\nStates, you mentioned it briefly, but I would like to go back a little bit in time, and talk\na little more about the time you spent at Landsberg.",
        "Answer: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m wondering if you might be willing to start there, and tell me if you\nremember when you came to Landsberg roughly, if you remember the month, and tell\nme how you -- what you were like, what your -- what sh -- kind of shape you were in\nwhen you got there.",
        "A: Well, we got there, I think the war ended in May and there we spent some times in\nCzechoslovakia, because you were in the te -- terezin -- Theresienstadt, and we were\ngetting ready to be like -- there was like a resettlement place to go -- some people went\nto their respective countries, and some people refused to go back to their own country,\nbad memories, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we were not treated very nicely when we came back to Poland. People would\nsay, you still alive? A lot of goods were confiscated, and they thought we were gonna\ntry to get it back, so that was not very popular thing to go back, especially to Poland,\nyou know, and that welcome. So they start asking people -- they tried to send out the\npeople from that area, like some people were from Russia, they going back here and\nthere. And I decided to actually go to Russia, cause I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t know\nabout America, if we can go here. So I knew Russians at the time, so I said I was from\nMinsk, cause I didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland. So they had a truck picking us up,\nand taking us somewhere, to a train station. And I forgot something, a sweater or\nsomething, I went back in the building. When I come, the truck was gone. So I was\nstranded in Czechoslovakia. And then they deci -- start talking about going to Israel, so\nthey were giving us like false papers, because the English Intelligence was checking so\npeople don\u2019t go to -- which wasn\u2019t Israel then, it was Palestine.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want the people go that way, you remember Exodus and all. So they\nwere giving us, like telling us that we Italians or Greek, so we can go that direction,\ntoward the sea, you know?",
        "Q: Whose they? Who was facilitating this?",
        "A: Well, the Jewish organizations, you know, I -- I couldn\u2019t recall that.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But we -- we s -- SO we were in a train going to Italy like, just to get closer to the\nsea, to go to Israel. And we supposed to be -- and I think, Italians and Greeks, or\nsomething like that, because they don\u2019t want to know we exist, because that would be\nobvious that we go to Palestine. So what happened, we r -- we ran out of food, so we\ntalked to a American rabbi, which was in a uniform, if he can help us. He say, you\u2019re\nsupposed to be Greeks or Italians -- I don\u2019t know how it came about, all of a sudden\nwe got surrounded by a bunch of military vehicles, English, and they turned the train\naround, and we went back to Germany, which we w -- that -- at the time, I think we\nwere in Austria. And end up in lan -- Landsberg [indecipherable]. And there was ex-\nmilitary camp where they t -- converted to a resettlement camp. W -- when we got\nthere, things were very primitive. There were nothing -- we met the American\ncommander, who was over that camp at the time, Mr. mi -- Meyerhoffer. I met him\nhere in a reunion, and I even got a book he wrote, that was a book with letters he wrote\nto his wife. And he says there was not toilet paper, there was nothing 1n there he\nordered from -- from American supplies to send us toilet paper. You know, they put a\nlot of people in there, and there was no facilities, no nothing. So we started off a police\ndepartment, and a employment, like bureau to get people jobs, and sanitary, and -- and\nlike -- and a cafeteria so people eat there. Everything was s --",
        "Q: Were there a lot of people there when you got there?",
        "A: Yeah, was a lot of people. Now, I couldn\u2019t tell you the numbers, I don\u2019t have no\nidea about numbers at the time, how many people.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Today everything 1s statistics, but that was camp in Landsberg.",
        "Q: Yeah, well I know that at -- at one point that they had at least 5000 people there.",
        "A: That\u2019s possible.",
        "Q: Yeah, I don\u2019t -- do you think it was that many when you got there?",
        "A: I -- I couldn\u2019t really tell you, I had no recollection in that area.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It was a lot of people, and of course, a-at times they fenced us around because there\nwas a lot of disgusted ex-prisoners going around in the German city, robbing, and\nstuff, you know, people were on the loose.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So they even put G.I.s, you know, watching the camp, and one day we had the\nuprising over there.",
        "Q: Over what?",
        "A: Because s -- we were contained and -- and -- and they wouldn\u2019t let us out, so we\njust di -- di -- a whole bunch of people got together like a big march, and tried to break\nout.",
        "Q: Yeah, they didn\u2019t want to be imprisoned again, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, so there\u2019s a lot of going on at the time. But anyway, we stayed there, and I\ndon\u2019t -- I cannot tell you, that\u2019s where I met her.",
        "Q: Well tell me about your job, you got a job.",
        "A: Well, I went to the employment office trying to get a job, and the guy who was\nrunning the employment office was nominated -- he was a Jewish fellow, and a police\nchief, they got the same name. So instead of working in an employment office, I work\nin a police station. And you couldn\u2019t tell it\u2019s police, because at the time there were no\nuniforms, everybody was -- she\u2019s got a -- you know. So I said no, I don\u2019t want to be a\npoliceman, you know, I\u2019ve got bad taste of police -- policemen from the war, you\nknow, and -- you know.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: They were usually working for the other side. But he said, \u201cThat\u2019s not that kind\npolice force,\u201d he said, \u201cWe just watch warehouses. But,\u201d he says, \u201cyou get a suit, and\nyou can eat in the cafeteria now.\u201d So I said, \u201cAll right.\u201d So anyway, I stayed about\nfour years in the police department, and that\u2019s where I met her, because she was 16,\nand her and a girlfriend went to a dance. And they supposed to been kinda cute, s-so\none of the musicians followed them home, and broke in in their rooms, and they s-\nscream, and people call the police. So I was one of the rescuers, me and another\npoliceman. So next day I come to see how they are doing, see? And --",
        "Q: Did you take that guy away?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we arrest him.",
        "Q: Put him in jail?",
        "A: He pull -- he pulled a knife on -- he got a stiletto on the table.",
        "Q: He was threatening her?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know what he was trying to do, but they were screaming, and they called\nthe police, and next day I came to see how they were doing, you know, and th-that\u2019s\nwhere 1s started.",
        "Q: So you stayed there for quite awhile?",
        "A: About four years.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then we went to Munich, and we start registering. Then I have no desire go to\nPoland, she went to Poland, came back, before she met me. She says -- she probably\ntold you about it, it was terrible.",
        "Q: Yeah, she did.",
        "A: So there was different offices you can register, go to the United States, Australia,\nCanada, I don\u2019t know, different places. So I put -- put my name different places, you\nknow. We had to get out of Germany. So we got a letter, which we were accepted, in\nthe Richmond -- [indecipherable] in the United States. So I don\u2019t know if should put\nthat on the tape, but I ask -- when the American soldiers -- we were driving around\nwith the military police, I said, \u201cDid you heard of Richmond, Virginia?\u201d He says, \u201cOh,\nyou\u2019re not going there.\u201d And I said [indecipherable] you know, so -- I -- that\u2019s just\nwhat -- I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, you know. When -- when I got -- we got the\nletter, we went to Munich, and of course there were arrangements to fly to United\nStates. But when I came to Richmond, I was unaware of the segregation. You know,\nwhen I was little, we -- we had the book about Uncle Tom, you know -- you know --",
        "Q: Uncle Tom\u2019s cabin?",
        "A: Yeah, cabin. I wasn\u2019t aware that there was a segregation, I would keep getting in\ntrouble. I went to a black -- black barbershop, and then when I met the barber on the --\non the bus, I sat with him, and the guy said, \u201cYou better get up because they\u2019re gonna\nstop the bus, because black people should sit in the back.\u201d And you know, so I kept\ngetting in trouble, because we -- after the war we didn\u2019t like discrimination at all, so\nthat\u2019s wha --",
        "Q: Let me go back and ask you a couple more questions about Landsberg.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: What kind of things did you do in your job as a policeman? I mean, you went and --\nand inner -- stopped this disturbance, but what other kinds of things did it turn out to\nbe?",
        "A: Well, most of the time we were -- we were watching warehouses. Then a lot of\ntimes they were giving out food and supplies, so we had to stay there, keep order, you\nknow?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was --",
        "Q: Di -- did you notice the conditions getting better at the camp, over time? You said\nthey were pretty bad when you first got there.",
        "A: Well yeah, yeah, yeah, they were getting better, because it was getting a little more\norganized. And we also had a lot of trouble with black market. I guess a lot of people\nwere -- you see, you couldn\u2019t use banks, so all the smugglers, you know, they -- they\nhad people carrying money, and they were s -- well, we had a lot of trouble with that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- and that was not official, because we couldn\u2019t go to the official places and\nprosecute them or something.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know? And there was a lot of smuggle, with the cooperation of the American\narmy. They were getting money together, getting the -- what do they call it, care\npackages. And what happened, those care packages were bought by groups of people,\nand when they came back to Germany, there was a crew unpacking everything and\nselling it on the black market.",
        "Q: Before it got to the people.",
        "A: Oh yeah, because it wasn\u2019t really meant for the people, they were -- they were\nmeant for s -- they were using as a cover up for smuggling. Because sum -- they didn\u2019t\nhave no license to sell cigarettes. And -- and they said, like Belgian or something, that\nwas legal to sell American cigarettes when they -- wh -- where the trailer came with\ncigarettes, the destination was somewhere else, we stop there, and there unload, you\nknow, there was -- there was a lot of that stuff. And United States, I mean, you hear\nabout a lot of offices were involved in that.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. What other kinds of things were -- you\u2019ve mentioned cigarettes, but\nwhat other kind of things were available or desirable on the black market?",
        "A: Chocolate, clothing. Most anything can be transported.",
        "Q: And -- and was there a place where you could go that you knew you could buy\nsomething, was there --",
        "A: Yeah, in like private homes. Some women had a restaurant in their house, they\nwere cooking, and go there and buy a meal. There was nothing official, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. But people -- because people were there for --",
        "A: Then the ORT come in, the head of the ORT organization. They were trying to\nteach people trades, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And they had schools, too?",
        "A: Yeah, they had courses for people to, you know, to learn, although how much you\ncan learn in a short time, but 1t was a beginning.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me what you remember about your wedding. It was, I understand,\nprobably one of the first weddings.",
        "A: Yeah, we had the whole place show up. You know, like in America they ca -- call it\ncovered dish party. Everybody brought something. And we even have a band. There\u2019s\na lot of people call themself musicians but they\u2019re not, and they -- and we have a band\nt -- that you could die laughing when they were playing, they were making false notes,\nand -- and everything. And there was a lot of people wini -- I never seen in my life.\nThere\u2019s two floors with people.",
        "Q: But it must have been a very happy occasion for everybody to experience a\nwedding --",
        "A: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- even though they didn\u2019t know you.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Just to know that life goes on.",
        "A: I know it.",
        "Q: Yeah. Same thing when your son was born. I\u2019m sure that was vicarious thrill for a\nlot of people.",
        "A: Yeah, we got in trouble, I was out of town, and s -- and a neighbor of ours, she say\nthat she got the pain, and a certain, you know, how you call it --",
        "Q: Labor pains.",
        "A: Uh-huh. And she went to hospital and they said they didn\u2019t have babies born this\nparticular hospital, there was another place which called San Cotilion, where they were\ntaking women over there. She when she went to the hospital, they told her to come\nback tomorrow, some like that. So she went back crying, she said, we have a neighbor,\nDolly, or something, and she was a hostile person, she came back, she says, she gotta\nbe here. And matter of fact, they called the police, because was some kind of a dispute,\nshe wouldn\u2019t leave, she cry, and said the policemen were my friends.[indecipherable|\nSo then when -- at -- at that time they didn\u2019t give them anesthesia, anything, so they\ntell them to pull, or something. So when she -- I was told that when she got in bed, the\ndoctor, who was standing [indecipherable] when he bend over, see how she doing, she\ngave him a slap in the face. But it was a dum -- it was al -- a1 -- litfak -- I mean, a -- a\n-- a Jewish fellow from Lithow, so she gave him a slap in the face. But anyway, that\u2019s\nthe way it went, and when I came back, she -- he was born the 12\" of December, and\nI\u2019m superstitious, and I finally got to the hospital, it was like 30 minutes -- 11:30 or\nsomething, and I said to the nurse, \u201cI want to see the baby.\u201d She said, \u201cTake your\ntime.\u201d And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting close to midnight, it gonna be the 13\",\u201d so I called the\nnurse and say you go -- she say, \u201cWhat are you crazy, sir?\u201d I say I want to see the baby\nnow, you know, about five minutes to midnight, and I made it. Yeah, there was a lot\ngoing on in those days.",
        "Q: Yeah. That must have been a happy time for you, after everything you\u2019d been\nthrough.",
        "A: I guess so.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I tell you, when we were liberated, when we li-liberated in Theresienstadt,\nnobody was happy, because you were kind of [indecipherable] and say why me, how\nabout my family, you know, there was no joy. Took a little time to get over the whole\nordeal.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But by the time you got married, and by the time your son was born, were\nyou able to feel that joy?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I guess so. I -- I -- you know, after all these years, today people analyze\nfeelings, and everyth -- in those days we didn\u2019t think about all those things, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s true. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say that. So you came -- you --\ntell me how it was that you got to come to Richmond. Was it through a c -- a certain\norganization that brought you here?",
        "Q: Ah, H-Hebrew Ladies Benevolent, which is now Jewish Family Services were --\nwe were accepted in this community, of course, oh it was fake, there was no job, or no\n-- no place to stay. After we got here, they started accommodating us. But they -- you\nneed somebody to guarantee they will -- you won\u2019t fall on nobody\u2019s mercy, that you\nwill have a place to stay, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and place to work, you know, so when we came here, [indecipherable] not 19\nStreet, and that was --",
        "Q: Do you remember arriving at the airport?",
        "A: Ah, where? In New York?",
        "Q: Is that where you came in?",
        "A: Well, we came in New York, and I -- oh, there was go -- some going on over there,\nscreaming, I don\u2019t know. Were the Union Station over there wa -- they call it. And --",
        "Q: You flew in, right?",
        "A: Yeah, we flew in, and then they took us to the Union Station to bring us back to\nRichmond.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, the train station.",
        "A: So we stayed there, I don\u2019t know, several hours, overnight, and then we were put on\na train that\u2019s coming to Richmond.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now we came to Richmond, there was a railroad station which is now a museum,\nand we got off, and this guy from the Ladies Hebrew Benevolent took us, and ask if\nwe were hungry, so he went across the street to a restaurant. And we are not -- we --\nwe were not used to that food, see? They gave you the sliced bread, and I take a butter,\nand I put the butter, and the butter went through the bread. You know, and we were\neating rye bread and stuff, so we were not used to this kind of s --",
        "Q: It was white, thin -- thin, white bread?",
        "A: Yeah, the sliced bread. I don\u2019t know who invented it, but --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, that was kind of funny. And then we were end up in na -- North 19\" Street, and\nshe was pregnant. Like -- like Mickey Rooney said one time, he was -- he was made\nin England, assembled in the United States. That\u2019s what happened with our daughter.",
        "Q: Your little girl.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you had a little baby boy, too.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: So, that\u2019s what happened, and --",
        "Q: Did they find you a job right away, or did you have to go out and find it yourself?",
        "A: Yeah, they -- they took me to a factory, and the place went on strike, and the people\nI work with were real nice to me, you know, they were happy, and I -- gave me rides\nhome. So when people went on strike, I went with them. And the guy who owns the\nplace, there was a Polish immigrant from World War One, I don\u2019t know, he came from\nNew York, and sat in a chair and he tripped me. If you don\u2019t get off, I send you back\nto Poland. So that was a mess.",
        "Q: What kind of factory was it?",
        "A: There was tobacco machinery. I had the experience because during the war, in\nsome concentration camps, I work in a machinery place. So --",
        "Q: Uh-huh. It was processing? Like, was it a processing tobacco?",
        "A:[indecipherable| machine, I know that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: So, you know, when I work in ge -- in Germany, in the machinery place, I was a\nprisoner, but everything has to be, like 30 minutes before quitting we had clean the\nmachines, and I -- I came in here, and it\u2019s the biggest mess I every seen in my life.\nTools were laying on the fl -- you know, how they waste stuff in here. Tools were\nlaying on floor, you know? So I asked this guy, his name was Rudy Star, he was also a\nGerman newcomer, if I can clean up, two, three weeks, pick up all the tools, you\nknow, put them in a tool room. Then they went on strike. So I went to electronics. So\nfrom then on, I worked for -- you -- you heard of Circuit City?",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: Well, Circuit City started in Richmond.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: What happened, there was two -- I don\u2019t know if you want to hear that.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: There was two guys, was Mr. Sainwerso. Sainwerso had relatives in Richmond, and\nhe was on the way to North Carolina buying land. So when he stop in Richmond, see\nhis relatives, there was no TV stores, that was 1948. So he got a friend working for -- a\nrelative, for a TV factory in New York, which was called at the time, Olimpy. And he\nsays, that\u2019s a good place to move. So he went back to New York, brought TVs in his\ntrunk. And there was a tire store here downtown, in [indecipherable] and there was a\nJewish fellow, he says -- he gave him a corner to sell some TVs.",
        "Q: In a tire store?",
        "A: Yeah, and those TVs went kind of fast --",
        "Q: I bet.",
        "A: -- so he went and got more TVs, then he brought his partner, which was ha -- Mr.\nHaig from New York, and they open a store next to Sears, and call 1t Ward\u2019s company.\nThe reason called Ward\u2019s, because Wardsell was his name. At that time was\nMontgomery Wards, you see.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But -- but they start Ward\u2019s, you know, W, Wardsell. Alan was his son, Ruth was\nhis wife, and -- and s -- that he used to name the comp --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- make Ward\u2019s. And then they went suing Montgomery Ward, because they -- they\ndidn\u2019t put Montgomery on the front. So he got some -- I don\u2019t remember all the\ndetails, they sued Montgomery Ward, and he won. And -- and that\u2019s the way it went,\nand then they start up in more stores, and clothing, and all kind of finagling, and all of\na sudden got a lot of employers, and everything and then they bought Lafayette stores,\nI don\u2019t know if you remember. Like Radio Shack, there was Lafayette stores, so he\nbought them. And -- and the [indecipherable] they were getting bigger, and bigger,\nthat\u2019s what Circuit City is now. So we used to have lunch with the bosses every day,\nyou know, with Mr. Wardsell. Matter of fact, when I [indecipherable]",

        "A: Well -- and two of my witnesses when I become citizen, Mr. Haig and Mr.\nWardsell, the -- the founders of Circuit City.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting. So you worked for them for -- for how long?",
        "A: For about -- almost 11 years. Then I went in my own business.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Well, what was it like for you to be here? Where -- whe -- did you speak\nvery much English?",
        "A: Little by little, I was learning, I mean, you know. I keep checking at that time that I\nlearn English, then I met some people from Poland, they tell me I speak Polish with\nthe English accent.",

        "A: We didn\u2019t have much connections with Americans.",
        "Q: And what were your first impressions of this country, or did you -- did you have\ntime to stop and think about it?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, it was kind of commercial, everything was money. You go ina\nrestaurant, you want the jukebox play, you had to put a money in it. Everything was --\ncan -- then there was a lot of waste. I see somebody write with the pencil and then\nright there throw it away. I went and picked it up, I said hey, that\u2019s not --",
        "Q: Even then, it was like that?",
        "A: Oh yeah. People throwing stuff away. You go now in a thrift store, you\u2019d be\nsurprised at the stuff people get rid of, I mean like valuables, expensive stuff, and --\nand they do that, I don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t have no patience. People who call me gave\nme TVs for nothing. Right now here, day before yesterday I pick up two TVs. The\nlady says -- from New York, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t want them. You don\u2019t want to take\nthem, Ill put them in a dumpster.\u201d I says, \u201cI'll take them.\u201d And they three or four year\nold TVs. People waste a lot of stuff here.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. What was it like for you socially? Did you socialize with other\nsurvivors, or not?",
        "A: Well, we were kind of pushed together because they keep us more or less together,\nbut we had here new American Jewish club, which was really founded by the German\nimmigrants. So we belong to that club, and everybody was meeting in there, and for\nseveral years, and -- but a lot of people left Richmond, because Richmond was really\ndominated by the -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re supposed to be Ashkenazis, I don\u2019t know, and they\nwere dominated here by the Sephardic Jews, you know, from Spain and Portugal. And\nthen the German Jews came in, and they kind of got on the top of everything. I don\u2019t\nknow, they elect me president, I was the only Polish. They all -- there was a German\nclub, and they -- they elect me president, I couldn\u2019t understand. So -- so a lot of people\njust left. [indecipherable] people stayed and open grocery stores, because lab -- if you\nwere a laborer, or something, there\u2019s a lot anti-sem -- anti-Semitism here, Jew this, and\nJew that, Jew \u2018em down, Jew \u2018em up. I had several fights. I was mad after the war,\nsomebody call me a name.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Boleslaw Brodecki. This 1s tape one, side B. You said that there was -- you\nencountered some anti-Semitism on the job here.",
        "A: Oh yeah, there -- there was -- on the job. And as a laborer, you -- I mean like one\nguy, which was retired from [indecipherable] company, went to work for there for\ndriving a taxi, and they call him Hebrew, you know? There w -- there wa -- it -- it -- I\ndon\u2019t see it now as much as then. And they said during the war, they drew swastikas in\nthe s -- they vandalized synagogues, but we didn\u2019t make too much fuss about it, even\nlately.",
        "Q: During which war?",
        "A: World War Two.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. There was vandalism here.",
        "A: Yeah, they put swastikas in -- in the departments to elevator and stuff like that. And\nvandalized some synagogues in a -- so I was in the Jewish community center, and it\nbrought -- a lot of time they wouldn\u2019t advertise it, because you say if you put it in the\npaper, it\u2019s getting kind of contagious. They just -- small vandalizing of the Holocaust\nMuseum here a few weeks ago, but we kind of keep it under cover. That was a few\nweeks ago, they vandalized the museum. And then we had committee in the Jewish\nCommunity Center examining newspapers from all over Virginia to find if it was anti-\nSemitic text. And they were trying to publish a Christian telephone book,\n[indecipherable] buy it from [indecipherable] so that was a fight over that, and then we\nhad another thing which, with high schools, like during Jewish holidays, so they don\u2019t\n-- they get credits, they can make up because th-this people of Jewish faith, that they\nwouldn\u2019t go to school during the Jewish hol --",
        "Q: On the holidays.",
        "A: That was a whole thing.",
        "Q: And this was in the 50\u2019s?",
        "A: No, that was lately in le --",
        "Q: Recently?",
        "A: -- last 10 years.",
        "Q: Yeah. What about 1 -- was -- was the anti-Semitism such that -- were you afraid? Or\nwas it just annoying?",
        "A: It was annoying, because like I -- I grew up in Warsaw, and I -- we are on the\nwarpath, I mean there was anti-Semites in Warsaw, but we\u2019re -- the Jewish guys, we\nwere -- like I was carrying a wrench and a chain with me, somebody hit me, then I get\nhim. We were -- we -- we were used to it, you know? And then there were Jewish\nstores in Poland where they -- they were working with signs, don\u2019t buy -- don\u2019t buy\nfrom a Jew, you know, so we were beating them up. I mean, there was a la -- th-that\u2019s\nwhy I was in a place here friends of ours, and -- and her son told her that they were\ntalking something against Jews on the bus, the kids. So she says, \u201cDid you get off?\u201d\nAnd he says yeah. And I say, \u201cWhen I was in Poland, we got in a fight, we didn\u2019t get\noff.\u201d But here, was a different attitude, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, we were annoyed, we still get annoyed with that kind of stuff, you know what I\nmean?",
        "Q: But it never got to the point -- there was never so much that you were afraid that\nsomething would happen to you or your family, or --",
        "A: Why? Y-You get afraid because some things will overpower you, no matter what\nyou do, you get overpowered. If you see somebody seven foot tall, a giant, and you\u2019re\na little fellow, sure, you\u2019re going to run. Like David and Goliath.",
        "Q: Right. But were there things that you would avoid doing, or places you would avoid\ngoing, or something, because you were afraid there might be a confrontation?",
        "A: In Poland?",
        "Q: Here, I\u2019m talking about here.",
        "A: I -- I -- I really couldn\u2019t recall it. I never been that bad, you know, actually.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to understand, you know, the degree of it.",
        "A: No, no, no they weren\u2019t that bad, just mostly vandalism, or stuff like that. And it\nhappened now with the -- they say it\u2019s on the increase. So, read it in the paper, they\nsay it\u2019s on the increase [indecipherable] this -- 1-1-it\u2019s complicated because, you know,\nin the United States, in the -- in the Congress, or what, they vote, and they try to --\npeople be against Israel, against Jews, so they spend money now, try to push that\npropaganda because everything if -- they [indecipherable] last summer, and they --\nthey voted on. So they try to turn people opinion of it. So it\u2019s nice when -- when the\nSaudi Arabian prince was trying to give six million dollars to -- at New York, to the\nmayor, he refused to take it, you remember?",

        "A: He refused -- they give him six million dollars, he refused to take it, even after 9-\n11.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. When your kids started getting old enough to wonder where their\ngrandparents were, you know, why don\u2019t we have relatives here, that kind of thing.\nDid they ask you questions, did you tell them, did you want to tell them what had\nhappened to you?",
        "A: Wh -- when they were little we didn\u2019t talk about 1t. Now when they started getting\nmature, th-they were going to that center and all that, they were finding out things for\nthemselves. It was -- I don\u2019t know, the fir -- the la -- last -- first 10 or 15 years, nobody\nwas really talking about. And people really picked up interest after the \u201967 war in\nIsrael. Even here we had troubles. We were collecting money for Jewish welfare for\nIsrael, and one guy who 1s a lawyer said, \u201cI don\u2019t give to causes like that,\u201d you know\nwhat I mean. And I ask one time, ah -- I -- owner of a big Jewish company store, he\u2019s\nretired, so I said now you ca -- you can visit Israel. He says, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the last place I\nwant to be.\u201d You know? So there was, even among the Jews, there was some kind of a\nway, when they was talking from years ago when delegation went to Roosevelt about\nwhat\u2019s going on and -- and it was --",

Oh, Mary is different, you know? When I worked for Ward\u2019s, there were black\ndrivers, you know, who were real -- a real low grade of people, not because they were\nblack, but they were alcohol, this, that.

        "A: Well, basically, we understood -- I don\u2019t know everybody did, Nixon wrote an\narticle in Reader\u2019s Digest at the time, if the Communists take over there, all the routes,\ntrade and commerce, everything going to be affected, if -- if the Vietnam turned\nCommunist, then -- we -- we didn\u2019t like what was going on, but it looked to us like it\nwas the right thing to do at the time. But we didn\u2019t know that so much politics were\ninvolved, because -- what was [indecipherable] was that port [indecipherable] and now\nthe supplies were coming in, and they never bombed that, they bombed it somewhere\nelse. Then when Nixon went to Cambodia with the universities here protest, and 1t was\n-- you had to study the whole thing, really, to understand what was going on there. We\ndidn\u2019t like -- the lot of people -- a lot of guys went to Canada, they don\u2019t want to get\ndrafted, and we didn\u2019t like it either, our son was in college, so he had a college\ndeferments, though, and he was a heck of a baseball player, they were trying to get\nhim in major leagues.",
        "Q: Baseball?",
        "A: Mm-hm. We had scouts about him, oh, we had New York Yankees, Pittsburgh\nPirates, and -- and we had a friend here, Eddie Casko, he was a major league player,\nand he came, and we beg him to talk Gerard go into baseball, because he would had to\nquit college, if he quit college, they send him to Vietnam. We came out of a war, I\nmean, you know. They -- so he came in here, and talked to Joe, he says, and the major\nleague is only 500 people, and half of them are black, and another part is South\nAmerican, and a red blooded American boy don\u2019t really get a chance to get in the\nmajor league, and that\u2019s the only way to be, if you get in. And -- and tried talk him out\nof doing it, you see. S-So he kept in college, and he went to the National Guard. By\nthat time, the war ended. But we didn\u2019t really want him go to Vietnam. He went to\nIsrael twice when the war started, he volunteer. Well, I cou -- we couldn\u2019t stop him\nthen.",
        "Q: Did you want to stop him?",
        "A: Yeah, she want to stop him. We didn\u2019t like him to do that, but we have friends in\nIsrael, and their kids were in the army, and I just didn\u2019t feel like morally, I have the\nright to stop him. He sold everything, he went to Israel, and a --",
        "Q: And he was a volunteer in a kibbutz?",
        "A: Yeah, but the idea 1s -- yeah, but the idea is that Israel is very particular about their\nsoldiers. If you go there they don\u2019t take you in the army, because you have no\nexperience. They di -- put you in the kibbutz and different places. And he was in one\nkibbutz, there were rats, there was nothing to eat. Yeah, you know, it\u2019s -- but he went,\nhe went. We couldn\u2019t stop him.",
        "Q: Did you try to st -- talk him out of it?",
        "A: Well, she was trying to talk him out of it as a mother, but I never said a word,\nbecause I just morally I feel like I have no right to do it. Cause a mother is a mother,\nyou know.",
        "Q: Hang on.",
        "A: That was the \u201967 -- not, that was the \u201983, I think. Wa -- wa -- one of the wars. I\nthink \u201967 he was too young.",
        "Q: \u00b073?",
        "A: Maybe.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Maybe, yeah. Boy, he -- the war didn\u2019t take very long, so that was all over.",
        "Q: Ra -- in the sevend -- late -- late 70\u2019s, or early 80\u2019s, there was -- when there started\nto be a lot of awareness in this country, a lot of public discussion about the Holocaust.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: There was a television program about the Holocaust, and a lot of people, you know,\nwho didn\u2019t know about it before, or didn\u2019t learn about it, became aware of it. And it\u2019s\nbeen getting more and more in the -- in the people\u2019s consciousness since then.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what was happening with you at that time? Did -- did you feel the\nneed to speak out more? Were you aware of this going on around you?",
        "A: Well, there was -- there -- there was a general trend between [indecipherable] and\nJewish community to have speakers go to schools, I went to several schools.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Uh-huh, oh yeah, I -- I got the -- I got that many letters, I know, from different\nplaces where I was speaking. I got a whole library of it.",
        "Q: What did you talk about?",
        "A: About the Holocaust.",
        "Q: About what happened to you?",
        "A: What happened to me, and -- and other ways in the -- after we through, I'll show\nyou something. I spoke to the governor\u2019s school several times. You know where the\ngovernor\u2019s school is. Outstanding students, above average. They have a separate\nschool for them, they call it governor\u2019s school. And because they cannot survive in a\nregular school, because they are above average, you know? So they call it the\ngovernor\u2019s school. Matter of fact, they just build thas -- got a new building just for\nthat. So I talked to the governor\u2019s school couple times, and University of Richmond.\nAnd I went to Lutheran church, high schools. At the beginning I took my son a couple\nof times, because I need some criticism. And so he gave me some hints, he -- the SS is\nstorm troop, th -- that was the bad people in Germany.",
        "Q: Storm troopers, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, so like Gestapo, SS. So he says, \u201cDon\u2019t say that, say German guards, because\nwhen s -- y-you use SS here, it\u2019s like support Saddam. You know, like -- said don\u2019t use\nthat term because the kids don\u2019t know what the SS. And then -- and then people would\nsay if I have any narrow escapes, and he says, \u201cWell tell them that you had one foot in\nthe grave, and one on a banana peel.\u201d So that was his advice to -- I want them to listen,\nI want to tell them, because my English was limited, so --",
        "Q: What was that like for you to talk?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I just kept talking. I -- I didn\u2019t have no -- any script, you know. And\nthen I-I tried to shorten my talk and answer questions, because you go to schools, the\nkids are in different grades, and different mentality, you know. So I don\u2019t want to -- I\ndidn\u2019t want to talk above or below. So I talk for a time, and then I said, \u201cI want to hear\nsome questions.\u201d Then I can go out to what they want to hear, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Boleslaw Brodecki. This is tape number two, side A. You were telling me before\nabout visiting -- ta-t-talking to the school kids, and -- and college kids, too, I guess.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Both. And you showed me the certificate you got from the Virginia Governor\u2019s\nschool. When you started -- when you started talking to kids, did -- what did -- did it\ndo something for you? I know I\u2019ve read letters from school kids to Holocaust\nsurvivors, and I think I have a sense of how powerful an experience it is for the kids to\nhear those firsthand, it\u2019s different from reading it in a book. But what is it like for you\nto tell those stories, to go through those memories over and over, and 1-it -- 1s there\nsomething -- do you like doing it?",
        "Q: Well, see, not being a professional speaker, or politician who wants to get elected\n[indecipherable] so our motives are -- are different, you know? You don\u2019t speak for\npopularity, or -- so first of all, what it does to you, it refreshes your memory. Because\nif you don\u2019t talk about it, it kind of fades out. You\u2019d be surprised how that comes out.\nAt one time I went, and -- she, when we had something happen, a robbery, you know,\nand she was very much affected, and we went to psychiatrist, and sat in front of the\npsychiatrist, put you in the mood, all of a sudden you remember things you never\nthought you were gonna remember. I don\u2019t know -- and by talking to the kids, and\nstudents, helps you -- your own picture of what happened. Yo-You do more analyzing,\nand remembering. Maybe if you wouldn\u2019t talk about it 20 years, you just -- and -- and\nthe reaction make you feel good that they understand what you talking about, like this\ntime I talk to the governor\u2019s school, the kids call me that I\u2019m a hero. Then several girls\nasked me if I can adopt them. And a -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- in a way, it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s fun.\nOne day I said to a guy, a Jewish fellow, we had a sh -- like a Yom HaShoah or\nsomething, and all the horrible stuff, and I asked a guy, \u201cDid you enjoy the show?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cHow can you ask me if I enjoyed it, it\u2019s not something to enjoy, you know.\u201d But\nyou enjoy the reaction.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You feel like you make friends, and -- and you doing for a good cause, because\nsome people say it never happened, you know, and it -- a-and you get kind of, say\nheck, I -- it never happened, I have a number here, and they tell me it never happened,\nI\u2019m a liar, you know. So you want to show you -- your side of the story, that this is not\na lie, that it really happened. So this is one good part of it, you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But for some people, too, remembering 1s not a pleasant thing, and they\ndon\u2019t want to do it, and they refuse to do it -- to go tell those stories, is --",
        "A: Well, that -- that\u2019s some people like that. Some people don\u2019t want to see any\nmovies, anything about it, because they say they just can\u2019t take it. Her doctor, she ask\nhim if he --",
        "A: Mine heart doctor. My cardiologist.",
        "A: -- if he -- if he was in the Holocaust Museum, he says he just couldn\u2019t take it. I -- I\nhad to take head shots for the movies --",
        "Q: Head shots.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Yeah, publicity, like --",
        "A: Now, wa -- yo-you got casting places, when they need you, they call you, but they\ngot to have a picture.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Like the director comes to Richmond, they going to make a movie, say I want him,\nand I want her, you know. So they had those pictures. So I went to the guy who take\npictures, and -- and -- and we said something about Holocaust and the guy got crying.",
        "Q: Crying?",
        "A: Crying. Was a --",
        "Q: Because you told -- he -- you -- it came out that you were a survivor, and he cried?",
        "A: Yeah, he got crying. So my daughter said don\u2019t pay attention to him. He says -- she\nwas working for a big company, she got fired for some reason, so he says -- her -- her\nboss who fire her, he also was crying about Holocaust, but she -- she got fired\nanyways. So she said, don\u2019t pay attention to him.",
        "Q: I lost my train of thought.",
        "A: Can I ask you a question, are you Jewish?",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m not.",
        "A: No, what -- I shouldn\u2019t be that inquisitive. What is your religion? Are you an\natheist, or what?",
        "Q: No, I was -- you know, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve had an opportunity to interview a lot of\nAmerican combat veterans from World War Two, and many of them had very ta --\ngruesome, terrible experiences, and experienced all their lives after they came back,\nflashbacks, you know?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Where suddenly they would be driving down a road, and all of a sudden they would\nremember something so vividly, they would have to stop driving, because it was so\ndifficult for them, so real, those images were so real. Did that happen to you, too, that\nkind of thing?",
        "A: I-I couldn\u2019t recall it. Some I recall, but not that intensive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- that there was some horrible stuff, I mean --",
        "Q: I mean, you had a very, very difficult, horrible experience.",
        "A: Yeah, I wa -- I --",
        "Q: And for a long period of time.",
        "A: Yeah, I was like -- I was in like seven concentration camps. The reason that many,\nbecause when -- when the Russians started advancing, they keep moving us, you see.\nAnd a lot of time we were not even guarded, and -- but there was no place to go, there\nwas January, was snow like this, and you go -- you had -- it was like in\n[indecipherable] everybody could -- now that you are in the -- and there was no place\nto run, you know. I was in the shlinterlovitch which was also on Upper Silesia. One of\nthe foremans was not a prisoner, she was a civilian. And he was trying to help me to\nescape. And I didn\u2019t trust him. I didn\u2019t go in for it, I didn\u2019t trust him. And after the war\nI find out he become police chief in that area, because people were turning you in, you\ncou -- you didn\u2019t know who to trust.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: At least you were alive momentarily, and next day they -- somebody turn you in,\nyou get shot, so -- especially in the winter, it\u2019s cold, and I mean you c -- you couldn\u2019t\nsurvive, you know. But the flashback, that\u2019s -- when we were talk, 1t comes back to as\n-- when you talk to kids, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah. Th-the question about trust, is something I want to ask you about, too. How\ndid it -- how did you, over time, deal with the question of trust, trusting other people,\nand knowing that somebody wouldn\u2019t turn on you somehow, or how -- how could you\nassume that people were good?",
        "A: Well, some I have no choice, you know, some I -- that\u2019s the only choice, you had to\ntrust somebody. For example, when I was in one camp, working a vakhar, which is\nlike a industrial place, and the railroad tracks on both ends of the -- whatever you call\nthat. And there were guards, and they were calling a guy -- you know, we didn\u2019t have\nanything, exe -- a little piece of cigarette, you know, where they throw it away, so the\nguards say, come on, get it. And he threw it on the other side of the track, where\nyou\u2019re not supposed to be, so the guy go there, get it, and he sa -- killed him, you\nknow? So -- and I had one of them, when we were marching to work, he passed by me\nand gave me some dry bread, put it in my pocket. Then when he was on guard, he\ncalled me, he says -- well, I trusted him, he says, \u201cAfter the war, I have a farm, you\u2019re\ngoing to be my coucher.\u201d\u2019 You know? And then he, one day he says he\u2019s in trouble,\nbecause if they find a guard helping the -- what they called at the time haftlinga, which\nis prisoners, they get punished, they might put them in a concentration camp. So he\nsays, \u201cSomebody, I think, see me helping you. We have to do something, we have to\ndo something. I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d So I said, \u201cWhat we do?\u201d He says, \u201cYou come up here,\nand when you come up, I\u2019m going to start to call you bad names, and kick you, and\ncall you,\u201d -- So I said, \u201cFine.\u201d So I went over there, he said, \u201cYou faftlifter, you the\nbingabanga woo woo woo.\u201d Then when I went away I [indecipherable] so it worked\nout pretty good. But you didn\u2019t know who to trust, you know, some na -- people\nhanging. People kill you for -- for -- for a bite of bread, and a -- especially when you in\nthe camp, you see hungry people go mean. When we came to Mauthausen, they put\n300 of us in a area maybe like those two rooms double, so they tell us to take the\nclothes off, put them together, and lay like -- like sardines against the wall. When they\ngot another row, they had to put their legs between your legs, and another row, and\nanother row. Now, it\u2019s cold, and people got to urinate a lot. At night, you cannot get\nup, if you get up, you step on other people, you can get beaten. So if you really had to\ngo, you\u2019d jump, and you\u2019d run on pe-people, and -- and you made up with a couple\nguys you -- you were laying with to show what place you left. And -- and -- and -- and\nit was a horrible thing because some people couldn\u2019t reach it.",
        "Q: Oops. Hold that thought.",
        "A: Some people couldn\u2019t leave, so -- so they just -- so they just -- just urinate, so you\nget up in the morning It\u2019s wet all over. And wa -- one night I was the -- see, we talking\nabout after the war, we got back in the war this time. That what you say, we can jump\nback?",
        "Q: I know. It\u2019s okay. Yeah.",
        "A: I was [indecipherable] and I supposed to have typhus, and I have a constant noise in my\nears. I couldn\u2019t eat, I couldn\u2019t keep balance. So a friend of mine, I gave him my portion of\nbread, so he was carrying me around so they don\u2019t catch me, because if they say you\u2019re\ndisabled, bingo. So what happened here, when I came to the factory, I couldn\u2019t keep balance,\nso the guy make me work, and I didn\u2019t make it, so they send me back in the barracks. Now,\nduring lunchtime or something, the guys were coming in, back to the barracks. So, there were\nbunkbeds. On every bunkbed, there was day shift and night shift was just one place to sleep ta\n-- every bunkbed was filled, three or four people. And, you know, you couldn\u2019t get in,\nbecause they push you out. So finally I sat on the edge of one, and I had a belt, which was cut\nin half so fix my wooden shoes so I don\u2019t lose them, you know? So I took the -- the belt I got\nin my pants, and put it around my throat, and I sit on the edge of the bunk, and tie it up, and I\njump, to hang myself. And I lost conscious, you know? I open my eyes, I\u2019m on the floor, and\nthe guy who I was giving the portion of bread, which was [indecipherable] he says, \u201cYou\u2019re\ngoing to miss your bread portion.\u201d And I could not move, I\u2019m all shaked up, so he said it three\ntimes, and he left, because he was afraid to lose his portion. So then I say -- I had a little metal\nbox, and there was a half a razor, and a couple cigarette butts. So I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do the\nJapanese stuff,\u201d you know?",
        "Q: Kall yourself with it.",
        "A: Somebody picked my pocket, and it was gone. So then I lay, I -- I don\u2019t know how long, I\nfinally got up, and -- and I was crawling around, trying to lay down somewhere, and the one\nbunk is -- only one person was there. So I figured he must be one of the kapos, you know, the\nfore -- foremans? So I can keep him -- one foot on the ground, and somehow I slip beside\nhim, and I think I went to sleep. In the morning, somebody wake me, and the guy say, \u201cYou\nbetter get away from there.\u201d I say, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cSomebody urinate, and there\u2019s urine under the\nbed in there. Gestapo, when they come, they ba -- beat the heck out of you.\u201d So I want to be\nnice, so the guy was laying beside it, I say -- try deliver the message, you understand -- the\nguy on the other side, \u201cLeave that man alone, he been dead since last night.\u201d That\u2019s why he\nwas sleeping alone. So --",
        "Q: When you got out -- when you came here, though, and -- how did you learn to trust people\nagain? Or did you?",
        "A: Well, that was [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t tell anybody how keep my money anything, I\ndidn\u2019t know [indecipherable] trust. I didn\u2019t do anything except somebody can tell me, and\nthere was just regular, every day life. You know, there\u2019s no -- no matter of trust. There was no\nquestion of trusting, because there were no dangerous [indecipherable] illegally trust\nsomebody, and they get you. It\u2019s just -- I don\u2019t know how to --",
        "Q: But I would think that even in the -- even in normal, every day life, you have\ncircumstances where you could assume that somebody 1s trying to take advantage of you in\none way or another. You know, it may not be a life or death kind of situation --",
        "A: Well yeah, well, if you -- if you --",
        "Q: -- but it could be in a normal course of interaction, you could --",
        "A: Yeah, well --",
        "Q: -- you could have an attitude that everybody\u2019s out to get you. That would be easy to\nassume.",
        "A: Well, tha -- that\u2019s -- no, I -- I don\u2019t think I was in that way. Well, usually when you\nmake a transaction with somebody, people mi -- we were trusting, we were given the\nwrong [indecipherable] the insurance man sell me insurance, and half of it weren\u2019t\ntrue. The -- if you went to buy a car, they tell you lies, you know, this certain amount\nhere of like salesmanship here, where people, they -- they say at [indecipherable] I got\nsuper salesman, and they got a super stupid people go in f-for the sales talk, I mean,\nyou know? And a lot of time, people figured that you are -- this has nothing to do with\nit, but a lot of time people figured that you don\u2019t know anything. To give you example,\nwhen there was a -- a -- a -- they were going -- like the president, there was between\nNixon and Kennedy.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: So me and my son took very much interest. We got a book from Kennedy, \u201cProfiles\nof Courage,\u201d and we read the paper, we even listen to [indecipherable] radio, and all\nthat. Where I go to fix a TV, and there was a guy, he\u2019s a president of this huge\ncompany. I think his name was West, or he live on West Avenue, he says, \u201cMr.\nBrodecki, when you finish working on TV, I want to talk to you.\u201d He was\ncampaigning for Nixon. Okay, he not ask me if I know anything about it or not. So he\nsays, \u201cYou sit down, I want to tell you so -- a little bit about Mr. Nixon.\u201d So I played\ndumb, I said, \u201cHow did you know him, where did you meet him? Did you,\u201d -- no, no,\nno. I said, \u201cDid you go to school with him?\u201d No, no, no. I say -- I didn\u2019t tell him that I\nalready knew more about it than he does. He was telling me -- he wanted to tell me all\nabout Mr. Nixon, like I was -- I came out of the woods, so you got a lot of things like\nthat here. Like you go look at the car, he says that\u2019s the best car, and then you read the\nConsumer Reports, you know exactly who -- who -- what it is with that. A lot of\npeople are just, you know, that way. A -- a woman ask me thi -- when I was working at\nWard\u2019s what\u2019s the best television to buy. If I tell her, she buys something else. I say,\n\u201cHow come you did?\u201d Oh, salesman told me that this is better. So you talk about trust,\nwho is -- you trust, people -- you can not be knowledgeable on every field. So people\nwill tell you stuff, and you believe it. But this is different kind of trust, during the war,\nwhere your life is in danger, you know, or your future. I mean there\u2019s different degrees\nof trust.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So, I don -- I know exactly what you\u2019re asking, but I -- I don\u2019t know how to answer\nit correctly.",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t know what the right answer is, so I\u2019m just throwing it out there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t trust one area, but the other area, you\u2019re too ignorant not to trust, do you\nknow what I mean?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: I wou -- I wou -- what hit me when we came here is the -- the advertisement, when\nthey were advertising cigarettes, every cigarette was the best, you know? Pall Mall\nwas the special people\u2019s smoke, and [indecipherable] is this, and that -- and we -- we\ndidn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t used to that kind of advertisement. It\u2019s just like I was driving here\none time a couple years ago, and -- and sees a lot of restaurants in Richmond. The\nBarkley Hotel dining room is above a mall. I went there, and I got lunch. That was the\nbiggest bunch of garbage I ever had in my -- so who do you trust?",
        "Q: Yeah. Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to understand, though, how you could go through\nwhat you went through and still have a sense of humor.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, but there was -- there was a lot of jokes during the war.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: There was a Jewish woman, and she was cursing all day long, Hitler, then -- I hope\nyou burn, I hope you drop dead, I hope this, I hope that, and continuously. So people\nsay, \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d She says, \u201cIt\u2019s always a moment when it comes true, and I\ndon\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah. I\u2019ve her -- I\u2019d like to ask you about when you came to the States, and you --\nit was a Jewish organization that helped you get settled here. So I\u2019m assuming that\nright away you had a chance to become part of a Jewish community here.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, well --",
        "Q: Yeah. And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m wondering if you ever experienced a situation where\nAmerican Jews didn\u2019t understand what you\u2019ve been through.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t like it, but they didn\u2019t -- first they didn\u2019t be -- some of\nthem didn\u2019t believe. Other say well, what\u2019s the big deal, a lot of people had trouble,\nIrish and Dutch, why I had to make a blow up about it. And well, you had to -- you\nhad to understand that people rel -- regardless of religions, they grew up in this\nsociety. They even have Jews which are anti-Semites. I have a neighbor which is\nblack, he hate niggers. I mean, he said they all crooked [indecipherable] so a -- a lot of\npeople got their own opinions, they grew up in this environment, so when they -- why\nshould they feel different than the next who 1s a Christian, unless they had some kind\nof education in that area? Those -- like we had a Yom HaShoah -- you know what that\nis?",
        "Q: Yes. A Remembrance day.",
        "A: One of the Jewish fellas didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t show up. I mean, acquaintances say, well\nwhere were you last night? Oh, I don\u2019t believe in that stuff. And he was also a\nnewcomer. He says people get killed here and there, why are the Jews making so much\nfuss about it, you know? So the people don\u2019t understand that they grew up in different\nenvironments, it\u2019s just that being Jewish 1s a religion, you might not even practice it. A\n-- a lot of people don\u2019t come to any events, and so just being Jewish doesn\u2019t mean that\nyou know everything, or you got the same outlook like the other Jews, you know,\nthere\u2019s just a difference in people.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: You know, people -- was a amian lady -- you -- you know Armenia --",
        "Q: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: -- was taken away from Russians. Between the Turks and the Russians, they did\naway with it. There\u2019s a Armenian woman working in a thrift store here. You know,\nwhen they first come, they get the minor jobs, then they go -- and -- and we met a guy\nfrom Russia which is Jewish, he\u2019s a Russian. So, it just a mentality. I was -- I stop now\nand then in thrift stores, some might pick up antique or something, so this Russians --\nRussian walked in, so I said to the Armenian, which she -- I said is -- one of your\nfriends is a Russian. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a Russian, he\u2019s a Jew.\u201d So what no -- no\nmatter what you do, you\u2019re a Jew. You\u2019re not American, you\u2019re not a -- I had that\nhappen, one day when I was in a automotive shop --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- and the guy said hey -- he\u2019s also a Polack. So he said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a Polack, he\u2019s a\nJew.\u201d So wh-what you gonna do? There -- there was a joke with this, you hear that\none? Where that drunk was in the -- and -- on the train, and he keeps saying that he\nhate Jews. So this Jewish fellow was sitting there, \u201cAnd I hate drunks.\u201d So finally the\ndrunk got laughing, and he says, \u201cWh-Why are you laughing?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m\nlaughing, I'll be sober tomorrow, but you'll still be a Jew.\u201d So you -- you -- don\u2019t\nmake any difference, Hitler find out you great, great, great father has Jewish wife, so\nright away you -- you a Jew, you know what I mean? So what are you gonna do about\nit?",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: If you -- if you convert to Catholic, you know what they say? He\u2019s a converted Jew.",
        "Q: Right. I just -- I want to ask you if there\u2019s -- if there\u2019s anything you want to talk\nabout, any subject that I didn\u2019t bring up, that you think is important for you to\nmention? Some -- something about your experience, or your attitudes, or anything?",
        "A: Well, I -- I really don\u2019t know, you kind of exhaust the -- all the territory about the --\nthere\u2019s not much I can say. There was a lot of incidents during the war.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Like I told you about when I was trying to commit suicide.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And there was other incidents. There was a couple things which I never understood,\nand this is a little spooky. I was dreaming a couple people in front of a bridge. Next\nday we were marching to Theresienstadt, and I see those two people, just like I had a\ndream exactly -- I don\u2019t know what it means. A couple times I had a dream and the\nnext day it kind of come -- come by me, just -- and I never understood how this come\nabout, that you know ahead of time. So we\u2019re telling here one time that a couple, all of\nsudden the guy got up at night, turned to his wife to come on. And they got 1n the car\nand went driving. Their kids got a accident somewhere miles away. Now this lady over\nthere, we were resting on the bed upstairs, which we cannot see what\u2019s going on. All\nof a sudden there\u2019s a knock on the door, and she says, \u201cDid you break your arm?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWhat in the hell are you talking about?\u201d She ran down and opened the door, and\nmy son walks in like that, he fell off the bicycle. And that\u2019s a true story.",
        "Q: Yeah, she told me that story.",
        "A: She told you?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a broader question. [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- I know that your question didn\u2019t have nothing to do with that answer, but I\ndidn\u2019t know how to get around to it, you just about exhausted the whole thing.",
        "Q: Is it po-possible for you to -- after all these years it\u2019s -- to come to grips with what\nhappened to you, to understand it in any way that -- that you can explain to other\npeople?",
        "A: Ah, I un -- I understand your question, but what can I explain. I would talk about it\nall the time there should be tolerance, understanding, and [indecipherable] not\neverybody so perfect to be Mother Theresa, you know?",
        "Q: Do you think that it could happen again, on that scale?",
        "A: Do y-you remember what Santiana said, if you forget your past [indecipherable]\nwill repeat itself. I -- I think that in the small scale, it\u2019s happening every day, because\nif you look at the Africa, some European countries, Asia, there\u2019s a holocaust against a\nlot of people. So it\u2019s not on the scale it was in World War Two, but things are\nhappening, and if -- if you don\u2019t listen -- for example, we -- we tried to stop it like here\nthey went to Iraq, and got Mr. Saddam Hussein Mr. Saddam Hussein would do like\nHitler do, occupy lot of countries, he probably holocaust a lot of -- a lot of people.

        "A: Yeah, well 1-1-1f -- 1f he wouldn\u2019t be stopped, just like Blair said, the English prime\nminister, he say if we went on the wrong information about the weapons of mass\ndestructions, and all, but there -- the future going to say that we did the right thing,\nbecause he was a villain. He was killing people, so we will be forgiven for that. But\nthat would be a holocaust if he -- he start with Kuwait, and goes Adurabi -- Abudabi,\nall those little countries. He probably kill millions of people. And so the Holocaust\ndidn -- didn\u2019t end it. During the Holocaust -- it\u2019s just -- you got small holocausts\ndifferent places to different people. I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s some American history, Billy\nJack, and all that stuff was going on over here. That wasn\u2019t very pretty, either, so --",

        "Q: Right, right. Yup.",
        "A: Like I see old American movies, and I see the sign in front of a -- a -- a restaurant\nthat say, dogs and I-Irish are not allowed, you know? They didn\u2019t discriminate against\nChinese, who build the railroad from New York to California. I mean, you know, so --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They\u2019re still in -- people, and it depends how many good people, how many bad\npeople, the good people win, or the bad people win. You know\u201d? And if the bad people\ntake over, you got another Holocaust, you know what I mean?",

        "A: Well, first of all, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in United States. Democracy, you know. You can\nsay things here where other countries you go to jail. You know what I mean? There\u2019s\nfreedom, and a lot of people take advantage of the freedom. But in the -- y-y-you\ncannot take away the rights from people. Where they got that here, anti-demafa --\nDefamation League?

I mean, that he understand like h-he really got -- took\ninterest in our family, then he went to Israel, and -- and he was a fundraiser that time,\na-and he was in this house when they called him in, they couldn\u2019t raise enough money\nfor the museum. He was awarded a United States -- so he went to work for the\nmuseum, and it was very difficult, but he says he wouldn\u2019t quit, or trust anybody with\nthe job. And a -- and a woman who was dying, who want the museum to survive was\nMr. Meyerhoff from Philadelphia, he put six million dollars for the museum. And he\ndid it for his wife, I think sh -- I don\u2019t know if she was a newcomer, and he called Joe\nhere, and Joe took the job. And he finished the job, he was -- you\u2019re going to see a\nWallenberg there -- oh, on 14th Street, and in front, Joseph Michael Brodeck1,\nNational Campaign director. But what happened after Clinton was elected, a lot of jobs\nwere appointed by the government, see? The people who started the museum, they\nwere out, they appoint other people. You know, which were democrats, I think. But\nanyway, he finish his job, so he went to work for Apec, that\u2019s where he got the picture\nwith the Jewish president. But he stay there for about a year, but he didn\u2019t like,\nbecause he said it was affected by local politics, like democrats, or republicans.",

        "Q: Both. And you showed me the certificate you got from the Virginia Governor\u2019s\nschool. When you started -- when you started talking to kids, did -- what did -- did it\ndo something for you? I know I\u2019ve read letters from school kids to Holocaust\nsurvivors, and I think I have a sense of how powerful an experience it is for the kids to\nhear those firsthand, it\u2019s different from reading it in a book. But what is it like for you\nto tell those stories, to go through those memories over and over, and 1-it -- 1s there\nsomething -- do you like doing it?",
        "Q: Well, see, not being a professional speaker, or politician who wants to get elected\n[indecipherable] so our motives are -- are different, you know? You don\u2019t speak for\npopularity, or -- so first of all, what it does to you, it refreshes your memory. Because\nif you don\u2019t talk about it, it kind of fades out. You\u2019d be surprised how that comes out.\nAt one time I went, and -- she, when we had something happen, a robbery, you know,\nand she was very much affected, and we went to psychiatrist, and sat in front of the\npsychiatrist, put you in the mood, all of a sudden you remember things you never\nthought you were gonna remember.

        "Q: -- but it could be in a normal course of interaction, you could --",

        "A: Well, we got there, I think the war ended in May and there we spent some times in\nCzechoslovakia, because you were in the te -- terezin -- Theresienstadt, and we were\ngetting ready to be like -- there was like a resettlement place to go -- some people went\nto their respective countries, and some people refused to go back to their own country,\nbad memories, you know.",
        "A: And we were not treated very nicely when we came back to Poland. People would\nsay, you still alive? A lot of goods were confiscated, and they thought we were gonna\ntry to get it back, so that was not very popular thing to go back, especially to Poland,\nyou know, and that welcome. So they start asking people -- they tried to send out the\npeople from that area, like some people were from Russia, they going back here and\nthere. And I decided to actually go to Russia, cause I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t know\nabout America, if we can go here. So I knew Russians at the time, so I said I was from\nMinsk, cause I didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland. So they had a truck picking us up,\nand taking us somewhere, to a train station. And I forgot something, a sweater or\nsomething, I went back in the building. When I come, the truck was gone. So I was\nstranded in Czechoslovakia. And then they deci -- start talking about going to Israel, so\nthey were giving us like false papers, because the English Intelligence was checking so\npeople don\u2019t go to -- which wasn\u2019t Israel then, it was Palestine.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want the people go that way, you remember Exodus and all. So they\nwere giving us, like telling us that we Italians or Greek, so we can go that direction,\ntoward the sea, you know?",
        "A: Well, the Jewish organizations, you know, I -- I couldn\u2019t recall that.",
        "A: But we -- we s -- SO we were in a train going to Italy like, just to get closer to the\nsea, to go to Israel. And we supposed to be -- and I think, Italians and Greeks, or\nsomething like that, because they don\u2019t want to know we exist, because that would be\nobvious that we go to Palestine. So what happened, we r -- we ran out of food, so we\ntalked to a American rabbi, which was in a uniform, if he can help us. He say, you\u2019re\nsupposed to be Greeks or Italians -- I don\u2019t know how it came about, all of a sudden\nwe got surrounded by a bunch of military vehicles, English, and they turned the train\naround, and we went back to Germany, which we w -- that -- at the time, I think we\nwere in Austria. And end up in lan -- Landsberg [indecipherable]. And there was ex-\nmilitary camp where they t -- converted to a resettlement camp. W -- when we got\nthere, things were very primitive. There were nothing -- we met the American\ncommander, who was over that camp at the time, Mr. mi -- Meyerhoffer. I met him\nhere in a reunion, and I even got a book he wrote, that was a book with letters he wrote\nto his wife. And he says there was not toilet paper, there was nothing 1n there he\nordered from -- from American supplies to send us toilet paper. You know, they put a\nlot of people in there, and there was no facilities, no nothing. So we started off a police\ndepartment, and a employment, like bureau to get people jobs, and sanitary, and -- and\nlike -- and a cafeteria so people eat there. Everything was s --",
        "A: Yeah, was a lot of people. Now, I couldn\u2019t tell you the numbers, I don\u2019t have no\nidea about numbers at the time, how many people.",

        "A: I -- I couldn\u2019t really tell you, I had no recollection in that area.",
        "A: It was a lot of people, and of course, a-at times they fenced us around because there\nwas a lot of disgusted ex-prisoners going around in the German city, robbing, and\nstuff, you know, people were on the loose.",
        "A: So they even put G.I.s, you know, watching the camp, and one day we had the\nuprising over there.",
        "A: Because s -- we were contained and -- and -- and they wouldn\u2019t let us out, so we\njust di -- di -- a whole bunch of people got together like a big march, and tried to break\nout.",
        "A: Yeah, so there\u2019s a lot of going on at the time. But anyway, we stayed there, and I\ndon\u2019t -- I cannot tell you, that\u2019s where I met her.",
        "A: Well, I went to the employment office trying to get a job, and the guy who was\nrunning the employment office was nominated -- he was a Jewish fellow, and a police\nchief, they got the same name. So instead of working in an employment office, I work\nin a police station. And you couldn\u2019t tell it\u2019s police, because at the time there were no\nuniforms, everybody was -- she\u2019s got a -- you know. So I said no, I don\u2019t want to be a\npoliceman, you know, I\u2019ve got bad taste of police -- policemen from the war, you\nknow, and -- you know.",
        "A: They were usually working for the other side. But he said, \u201cThat\u2019s not that kind\npolice force,\u201d he said, \u201cWe just watch warehouses. But,\u201d he says, \u201cyou get a suit, and\nyou can eat in the cafeteria now.\u201d So I said, \u201cAll right.\u201d So anyway, I stayed about\nfour years in the police department, and that\u2019s where I met her, because she was 16,\nand her and a girlfriend went to a dance. And they supposed to been kinda cute, s-so\none of the musicians followed them home, and broke in in their rooms, and they s-\nscream, and people call the police. So I was one of the rescuers, me and another\npoliceman. So next day I come to see how they are doing, see? And --",

        "A: About four years.",

        "A: So there was different offices you can register, go to the United States, Australia,\nCanada, I don\u2019t know, different places. So I put -- put my name different places, you\nknow. We had to get out of Germany. So we got a letter, which we were accepted, in\nthe Richmond -- [indecipherable] in the United States. So I don\u2019t know if should put\nthat on the tape, but I ask -- when the American soldiers -- we were driving around\nwith the military police, I said, \u201cDid you heard of Richmond, Virginia?\u201d He says, \u201cOh,\nyou\u2019re not going there.\u201d And I said [indecipherable] you know, so -- I -- that\u2019s just\nwhat -- I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, you know. When -- when I got -- we got the\nletter, we went to Munich, and of course there were arrangements to fly to United\nStates. But when I came to Richmond, I was unaware of the segregation.

        "A: Yeah, cabin. I wasn\u2019t aware that there was a segregation, I would keep getting in\ntrouble. I went to a black -- black barbershop, and then when I met the barber on the --\non the bus, I sat with him, and the guy said, \u201cYou better get up because they\u2019re gonna\nstop the bus, because black people should sit in the back.\u201d And you know, so I kept\ngetting in trouble, because we -- after the war we didn\u2019t like discrimination at all, so\nthat\u2019s wha --",

        "A: Well yeah, yeah, yeah, they were getting better, because it was getting a little more\norganized. And we also had a lot of trouble with black market. I guess a lot of people\nwere -- you see, you couldn\u2019t use banks, so all the smugglers, you know, they -- they\nhad people carrying money, and they were s -- well, we had a lot of trouble with that.",

        "A: You know? And there was a lot of smuggle, with the cooperation of the American\narmy. They were getting money together, getting the -- what do they call it, care\npackages. And what happened, those care packages were bought by groups of people,\nand when they came back to Germany, there was a crew unpacking everything and\nselling it on the black market.",
        "A: Oh yeah, because it wasn\u2019t really meant for the people, they were -- they were\nmeant for s -- they were using as a cover up for smuggling. Because sum -- they didn\u2019t\nhave no license to sell cigarettes. And -- and they said, like Belgian or something, that\nwas legal to sell American cigarettes when they -- wh -- where the trailer came with\ncigarettes, the destination was somewhere else, we stop there, and there unload, you\nknow, there was -- there was a lot of that stuff. And United States, I mean, you hear\nabout a lot of offices were involved in that.",

There\u2019s\na lot of people call themself musicians but they\u2019re not, and they -- and we have a band\nt -- that you could die laughing when they were playing, they were making false notes,\nand -- and everything.

And she went to hospital and they said they didn\u2019t have babies born this\nparticular hospital, there was another place which called San Cotilion, where they were\ntaking women over there. She when she went to the hospital, they told her to come\nback tomorrow, some like that. So she went back crying, she said, we have a neighbor,\nDolly, or something, and she was a hostile person, she came back, she says, she gotta\nbe here. And matter of fact, they called the police, because was some kind of a dispute,\nshe wouldn\u2019t leave, she cry, and said the policemen were my friends.[indecipherable|\nSo then when -- at -- at that time they didn\u2019t give them anesthesia, anything, so they\ntell them to pull, or something.

And then he said, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t invite me\nto the kitchen?\u201d I say, \u201cYou are southern, and you don\u2019t like black people, I didn\u2019t\nwant to offend you, we don\u2019t mind.\u201d He says, \u201cDamn it, let me go in there.\u201d And he\ncame in and sat with us, remember? Because we said he came in later, we sit down,\nthere was Jimmy Glynn, there was a couple who help us move, and we had dinner with\nthem, and this white guy, he said, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t invite me there?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I\nsay, \u201cyou a southerner, you don\u2019t like black people, I didn\u2019t want to have any friction.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m going.\u201d And he came in and sat with us. But I mean, that is -- there\nweren\u2019t much you can do about it, because we were guests over here. Couple of times\npeople said, \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you go back home?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah. Ak -- a few times that -- and they say, if you don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you go\nback where you came from? Like I interfere with somebody else\u2019s --",
        "A: So, we were kind -- in the middle.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, basically, we understood -- I don\u2019t know everybody did, Nixon wrote an\narticle in Reader\u2019s Digest at the time, if the Communists take over there, all the routes,\ntrade and commerce, everything going to be affected, if -- if the Vietnam turned\nCommunist, then -- we -- we didn\u2019t like what was going on, but it looked to us like it\nwas the right thing to do at the time. But we didn\u2019t know that so much politics were\ninvolved, because -- what was [indecipherable] was that port [indecipherable] and now\nthe supplies were coming in, and they never bombed that, they bombed it somewhere\nelse. Then when Nixon went to Cambodia with the universities here protest, and 1t was\n-- you had to study the whole thing, really, to understand what was going on there. We\ndidn\u2019t like -- the lot of people -- a lot of guys went to Canada, they don\u2019t want to get\ndrafted, and we didn\u2019t like it either, our son was in college, so he had a college\ndeferments, though, and he was a heck of a baseball player, they were trying to get\nhim in major leagues.",
        "A: Mm-hm. We had scouts about him, oh, we had New York Yankees, Pittsburgh\nPirates, and -- and we had a friend here, Eddie Casko, he was a major league player,\nand he came, and we beg him to talk Gerard go into baseball, because he would had to\nquit college, if he quit college, they send him to Vietnam. We came out of a war, I\nmean, you know. They -- so he came in here, and talked to Joe, he says, and the major\nleague is only 500 people, and half of them are black, and another part is South\nAmerican, and a red blooded American boy don\u2019t really get a chance to get in the\nmajor league, and that\u2019s the only way to be, if you get in. And -- and tried talk him out\nof doing it, you see. S-So he kept in college, and he went to the National Guard. By\nthat time, the war ended. But we didn\u2019t really want him go to Vietnam. He went to\nIsrael twice when the war started, he volunteer. Well, I cou -- we couldn\u2019t stop him\nthen.",
        "A: Yeah, she want to stop him. We didn\u2019t like him to do that, but we have friends in\nIsrael, and their kids were in the army, and I just didn\u2019t feel like morally, I have the\nright to stop him. He sold everything, he went to Israel, and a --",
        "A: Yeah, but the idea 1s -- yeah, but the idea is that Israel is very particular about their\nsoldiers. If you go there they don\u2019t take you in the army, because you have no\nexperience. They di -- put you in the kibbutz and different places. And he was in one\nkibbutz, there were rats, there was nothing to eat. Yeah, you know, it\u2019s -- but he went,\nhe went. We couldn\u2019t stop him.",
        "A: Well, she was trying to talk him out of it as a mother, but I never said a word,\nbecause I just morally I feel like I have no right to do it. Cause a mother is a mother,\nyou know.",
        "A: That was the \u201967 -- not, that was the \u201983, I think. Wa -- wa -- one of the wars. I\nthink \u201967 he was too young.",
        "A: Maybe.",
        "A: Maybe, yeah. Boy, he -- the war didn\u2019t take very long, so that was all over.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, there was -- there -- there was a general trend between [indecipherable] and\nJewish community to have speakers go to schools, I went to several schools.",
        "A: Uh-huh, oh yeah, I -- I got the -- I got that many letters, I know, from different\nplaces where I was speaking. I got a whole library of it.",
        "A: About the Holocaust.",
        "A: What happened to me, and -- and other ways in the -- after we through, I'll show\nyou something. I spoke to the governor\u2019s school several times. You know where the\ngovernor\u2019s school is. Outstanding students, above average. They have a separate\nschool for them, they call it governor\u2019s school. And because they cannot survive in a\nregular school, because they are above average, you know? So they call it the\ngovernor\u2019s school. Matter of fact, they just build thas -- got a new building just for\nthat. So I talked to the governor\u2019s school couple times, and University of Richmond.\nAnd I went to Lutheran church, high schools. At the beginning I took my son a couple\nof times, because I need some criticism. And so he gave me some hints, he -- the SS is\nstorm troop, th -- that was the bad people in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, so like Gestapo, SS. So he says, \u201cDon\u2019t say that, say German guards, because\nwhen s -- y-you use SS here, it\u2019s like support Saddam. You know, like -- said don\u2019t use\nthat term because the kids don\u2019t know what the SS. And then -- and then people would\nsay if I have any narrow escapes, and he says, \u201cWell tell them that you had one foot in\nthe grave, and one on a banana peel.\u201d So that was his advice to -- I want them to listen,\nI want to tell them, because my English was limited, so --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I just kept talking. I -- I didn\u2019t have no -- any script, you know. And\nthen I-I tried to shorten my talk and answer questions, because you go to schools, the\nkids are in different grades, and different mentality, you know. So I don\u2019t want to -- I\ndidn\u2019t want to talk above or below. So I talk for a time, and then I said, \u201cI want to hear\nsome questions.\u201d Then I can go out to what they want to hear, you know?\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nand remembering. Maybe if you wouldn\u2019t talk about it 20 years, you just -- and -- and\nthe reaction make you feel good that they understand what you talking about, like this\ntime I talk to the governor\u2019s school, the kids call me that I\u2019m a hero. Then several girls\nasked me if I can adopt them. And a -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- in a way, it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s fun.\nOne day I said to a guy, a Jewish fellow, we had a sh -- like a Yom HaShoah or\nsomething, and all the horrible stuff, and I asked a guy, \u201cDid you enjoy the show?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cHow can you ask me if I enjoyed it, it\u2019s not something to enjoy, you know.\u201d But\nyou enjoy the reaction.",
        "A: You feel like you make friends, and -- and you doing for a good cause, because\nsome people say it never happened, you know, and it -- a-and you get kind of, say\nheck, I -- it never happened, I have a number here, and they tell me it never happened,\nI\u2019m a liar, you know. So you want to show you -- your side of the story, that this is not\na lie, that it really happened. So this is one good part of it, you know.",
        "A: Well, that -- that\u2019s some people like that. Some people don\u2019t want to see any\nmovies, anything about it, because they say they just can\u2019t take it. Her doctor, she ask\nhim if he --",
        "A: Mine heart doctor. My cardiologist.",
        "A: -- if he -- if he was in the Holocaust Museum, he says he just couldn\u2019t take it. I -- I\nhad to take head shots for the movies --",
        "A: You know.",
        "A: Now, wa -- yo-you got casting places, when they need you, they call you, but they\ngot to have a picture.",
        "A: Like the director comes to Richmond, they going to make a movie, say I want him,\nand I want her, you know. So they had those pictures. So I went to the guy who take\npictures, and -- and -- and we said something about Holocaust and the guy got crying.",
        "A: Crying. Was a --",
        "A: Yeah, he got crying. So my daughter said don\u2019t pay attention to him. He says -- she\nwas working for a big company, she got fired for some reason, so he says -- her -- her\nboss who fire her, he also was crying about Holocaust, but she -- she got fired\nanyways. So she said, don\u2019t pay attention to him.",
        "A: Can I ask you a question, are you Jewish?",
        "A: No, what -- I shouldn\u2019t be that inquisitive. What is your religion? Are you an\natheist, or what?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I-I couldn\u2019t recall it. Some I recall, but not that intensive.",
        "A: You know --",
        "A: -- that there was some horrible stuff, I mean --",
        "A: Yeah, I wa -- I --",
        "A: Yeah, I was like -- I was in like seven concentration camps. The reason that many,\nbecause when -- when the Russians started advancing, they keep moving us, you see.\nAnd a lot of time we were not even guarded, and -- but there was no place to go, there\nwas January, was snow like this, and you go -- you had -- it was like in\n[indecipherable] everybody could -- now that you are in the -- and there was no place\nto run, you know. I was in the shlinterlovitch which was also on Upper Silesia. One of\nthe foremans was not a prisoner, she was a civilian. And he was trying to help me to\nescape. And I didn\u2019t trust him. I didn\u2019t go in for it, I didn\u2019t trust him. And after the war\nI find out he become police chief in that area, because people were turning you in, you\ncou -- you didn\u2019t know who to trust.",
        "A: At least you were alive momentarily, and next day they -- somebody turn you in,\nyou get shot, so -- especially in the winter, it\u2019s cold, and I mean you c -- you couldn\u2019t\nsurvive, you know. But the flashback, that\u2019s -- when we were talk, 1t comes back to as\n-- when you talk to kids, you know.",
        "A: Well, some I have no choice, you know, some I -- that\u2019s the only choice, you had to\ntrust somebody. For example, when I was in one camp, working a vakhar, which is\nlike a industrial place, and the railroad tracks on both ends of the -- whatever you call\nthat. And there were guards, and they were calling a guy -- you know, we didn\u2019t have\nanything, exe -- a little piece of cigarette, you know, where they throw it away, so the\nguards say, come on, get it. And he threw it on the other side of the track, where\nyou\u2019re not supposed to be, so the guy go there, get it, and he sa -- killed him, you\nknow? So -- and I had one of them, when we were marching to work, he passed by me\nand gave me some dry bread, put it in my pocket. Then when he was on guard, he\ncalled me, he says -- well, I trusted him, he says, \u201cAfter the war, I have a farm, you\u2019re\ngoing to be my coucher.\u201d\u2019 You know? And then he, one day he says he\u2019s in trouble,\nbecause if they find a guard helping the -- what they called at the time haftlinga, which\nis prisoners, they get punished, they might put them in a concentration camp. So he\nsays, \u201cSomebody, I think, see me helping you. We have to do something, we have to\ndo something. I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d So I said, \u201cWhat we do?\u201d He says, \u201cYou come up here,\nand when you come up, I\u2019m going to start to call you bad names, and kick you, and\ncall you,\u201d -- So I said, \u201cFine.\u201d So I went over there, he said, \u201cYou faftlifter, you the\nbingabanga woo woo woo.\u201d Then when I went away I [indecipherable] so it worked\nout pretty good. But you didn\u2019t know who to trust, you know, some na -- people\nhanging. People kill you for -- for -- for a bite of bread, and a -- especially when you in\nthe camp, you see hungry people go mean. When we came to Mauthausen, they put\n300 of us in a area maybe like those two rooms double, so they tell us to take the\nclothes off, put them together, and lay like -- like sardines against the wall. When they\ngot another row, they had to put their legs between your legs, and another row, and\nanother row. Now, it\u2019s cold, and people got to urinate a lot. At night, you cannot get\nup, if you get up, you step on other people, you can get beaten. So if you really had to\ngo, you\u2019d jump, and you\u2019d run on pe-people, and -- and you made up with a couple\nguys you -- you were laying with to show what place you left. And -- and -- and -- and\nit was a horrible thing because some people couldn\u2019t reach it.",
        "A: Some people couldn\u2019t leave, so -- so they just -- so they just -- just urinate, so you\nget up in the morning It\u2019s wet all over. And wa -- one night I was the -- see, we talking\nabout after the war, we got back in the war this time. That what you say, we can jump\nback?",
        "A: I was [indecipherable] and I supposed to have typhus, and I have a constant noise in my\nears. I couldn\u2019t eat, I couldn\u2019t keep balance. So a friend of mine, I gave him my portion of\nbread, so he was carrying me around so they don\u2019t catch me, because if they say you\u2019re\ndisabled, bingo. So what happened here, when I came to the factory, I couldn\u2019t keep balance,\nso the guy make me work, and I didn\u2019t make it, so they send me back in the barracks. Now,\nduring lunchtime or something, the guys were coming in, back to the barracks. So, there were\nbunkbeds. On every bunkbed, there was day shift and night shift was just one place to sleep ta\n-- every bunkbed was filled, three or four people. And, you know, you couldn\u2019t get in,\nbecause they push you out. So finally I sat on the edge of one, and I had a belt, which was cut\nin half so fix my wooden shoes so I don\u2019t lose them, you know? So I took the -- the belt I got\nin my pants, and put it around my throat, and I sit on the edge of the bunk, and tie it up, and I\njump, to hang myself. And I lost conscious, you know? I open my eyes, I\u2019m on the floor, and\nthe guy who I was giving the portion of bread, which was [indecipherable] he says, \u201cYou\u2019re\ngoing to miss your bread portion.\u201d And I could not move, I\u2019m all shaked up, so he said it three\ntimes, and he left, because he was afraid to lose his portion. So then I say -- I had a little metal\nbox, and there was a half a razor, and a couple cigarette butts. So I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do the\nJapanese stuff,\u201d you know?",
        "A: Somebody picked my pocket, and it was gone. So then I lay, I -- I don\u2019t know how long, I\nfinally got up, and -- and I was crawling around, trying to lay down somewhere, and the one\nbunk is -- only one person was there. So I figured he must be one of the kapos, you know, the\nfore -- foremans? So I can keep him -- one foot on the ground, and somehow I slip beside\nhim, and I think I went to sleep. In the morning, somebody wake me, and the guy say, \u201cYou\nbetter get away from there.\u201d I say, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cSomebody urinate, and there\u2019s urine under the\nbed in there. Gestapo, when they come, they ba -- beat the heck out of you.\u201d So I want to be\nnice, so the guy was laying beside it, I say -- try deliver the message, you understand -- the\nguy on the other side, \u201cLeave that man alone, he been dead since last night.\u201d That\u2019s why he\nwas sleeping alone. So --",
        "A: Well, that was [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t tell anybody how keep my money anything, I\ndidn\u2019t know [indecipherable] trust. I didn\u2019t do anything except somebody can tell me, and\nthere was just regular, every day life. You know, there\u2019s no -- no matter of trust. There was no\nquestion of trusting, because there were no dangerous [indecipherable] illegally trust\nsomebody, and they get you. It\u2019s just -- I don\u2019t know how to --",
        "A: Well yeah, well, if you -- if you --",
        "A: Yeah, well --",
        "A: Well, tha -- that\u2019s -- no, I -- I don\u2019t think I was in that way. Well, usually when you\nmake a transaction with somebody, people mi -- we were trusting, we were given the\nwrong [indecipherable] the insurance man sell me insurance, and half of it weren\u2019t\ntrue. The -- if you went to buy a car, they tell you lies, you know, this certain amount\nhere of like salesmanship here, where people, they -- they say at [indecipherable] I got\nsuper salesman, and they got a super stupid people go in f-for the sales talk, I mean,\nyou know? And a lot of time, people figured that you are -- this has nothing to do with\nit, but a lot of time people figured that you don\u2019t know anything. To give you example,\nwhen there was a -- a -- a -- they were going -- like the president, there was between\nNixon and Kennedy.",
        "A: So me and my son took very much interest. We got a book from Kennedy, \u201cProfiles\nof Courage,\u201d and we read the paper, we even listen to [indecipherable] radio, and all\nthat. Where I go to fix a TV, and there was a guy, he\u2019s a president of this huge\ncompany. I think his name was West, or he live on West Avenue, he says, \u201cMr.\nBrodecki, when you finish working on TV, I want to talk to you.\u201d He was\ncampaigning for Nixon. Okay, he not ask me if I know anything about it or not. So he\nsays, \u201cYou sit down, I want to tell you so -- a little bit about Mr. Nixon.\u201d So I played\ndumb, I said, \u201cHow did you know him, where did you meet him? Did you,\u201d -- no, no,\nno. I said, \u201cDid you go to school with him?\u201d No, no, no. I say -- I didn\u2019t tell him that I\nalready knew more about it than he does. He was telling me -- he wanted to tell me all\nabout Mr. Nixon, like I was -- I came out of the woods, so you got a lot of things like\nthat here. Like you go look at the car, he says that\u2019s the best car, and then you read the\nConsumer Reports, you know exactly who -- who -- what it is with that. A lot of\npeople are just, you know, that way. A -- a woman ask me thi -- when I was working at\nWard\u2019s what\u2019s the best television to buy. If I tell her, she buys something else. I say,\n\u201cHow come you did?\u201d Oh, salesman told me that this is better. So you talk about trust,\nwho is -- you trust, people -- you can not be knowledgeable on every field. So people\nwill tell you stuff, and you believe it. But this is different kind of trust, during the war,\nwhere your life is in danger, you know, or your future. I mean there\u2019s different degrees\nof trust.",
        "A: So, I don -- I know exactly what you\u2019re asking, but I -- I don\u2019t know how to answer\nit correctly.",
        "A: I don\u2019t trust one area, but the other area, you\u2019re too ignorant not to trust, do you\nknow what I mean?",
        "A: I wou -- I wou -- what hit me when we came here is the -- the advertisement, when\nthey were advertising cigarettes, every cigarette was the best, you know? Pall Mall\nwas the special people\u2019s smoke, and [indecipherable] is this, and that -- and we -- we\ndidn\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t used to that kind of advertisement. It\u2019s just like I was driving here\none time a couple years ago, and -- and sees a lot of restaurants in Richmond. The\nBarkley Hotel dining room is above a mall. I went there, and I got lunch. That was the\nbiggest bunch of garbage I ever had in my -- so who do you trust?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, but there was -- there was a lot of jokes during the war.",
        "A: There was a Jewish woman, and she was cursing all day long, Hitler, then -- I hope\nyou burn, I hope you drop dead, I hope this, I hope that, and continuously. So people\nsay, \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d She says, \u201cIt\u2019s always a moment when it comes true, and I\ndon\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d",
        "A: Y-Yeah, well --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t like it, but they didn\u2019t -- first they didn\u2019t be -- some of\nthem didn\u2019t believe. Other say well, what\u2019s the big deal, a lot of people had trouble,\nIrish and Dutch, why I had to make a blow up about it. And well, you had to -- you\nhad to understand that people rel -- regardless of religions, they grew up in this\nsociety. They even have Jews which are anti-Semites. I have a neighbor which is\nblack, he hate niggers. I mean, he said they all crooked [indecipherable] so a -- a lot of\npeople got their own opinions, they grew up in this environment, so when they -- why\nshould they feel different than the next who 1s a Christian, unless they had some kind\nof education in that area? Those -- like we had a Yom HaShoah -- you know what that\nis?",
        "A: One of the Jewish fellas didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t show up. I mean, acquaintances say, well\nwhere were you last night? Oh, I don\u2019t believe in that stuff. And he was also a\nnewcomer. He says people get killed here and there, why are the Jews making so much\nfuss about it, you know? So the people don\u2019t understand that they grew up in different\nenvironments, it\u2019s just that being Jewish 1s a religion, you might not even practice it. A\n-- a lot of people don\u2019t come to any events, and so just being Jewish doesn\u2019t mean that\nyou know everything, or you got the same outlook like the other Jews, you know,\nthere\u2019s just a difference in people.",

You know,\nwhen they first come, they get the minor jobs, then they go -- and -- and we met a guy\nfrom Russia which is Jewish, he\u2019s a Russian. So, it just a mentality. I was -- I stop now\nand then in thrift stores, some might pick up antique or something, so this Russians --\nRussian walked in, so I said to the Armenian, which she -- I said is -- one of your\nfriends is a Russian. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a Russian, he\u2019s a Jew.\u201d So what no -- no\nmatter what you do, you\u2019re a Jew.

        "A: Like I told you about when I was trying to commit suicide.",
        "A: And there was other incidents. There was a couple things which I never understood,\nand this is a little spooky. I was dreaming a couple people in front of a bridge. Next\nday we were marching to Theresienstadt, and I see those two people, just like I had a\ndream exactly -- I don\u2019t know what it means. A couple times I had a dream and the\nnext day it kind of come -- come by me, just -- and I never understood how this come\nabout, that you know ahead of time. So we\u2019re telling here one time that a couple, all of\nsudden the guy got up at night, turned to his wife to come on. And they got 1n the car\nand went driving. Their kids got a accident somewhere miles away. Now this lady over\nthere, we were resting on the bed upstairs, which we cannot see what\u2019s going on. All\nof a sudden there\u2019s a knock on the door, and she says, \u201cDid you break your arm?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWhat in the hell are you talking about?\u201d She ran down and opened the door, and\nmy son walks in like that, he fell off the bicycle.

        "A: Do y-you remember what Santiana said, if you forget your past [indecipherable]\nwill repeat itself. I -- I think that in the small scale, it\u2019s happening every day, because\nif you look at the Africa, some European countries, Asia, there\u2019s a holocaust against a\nlot of people. So it\u2019s not on the scale it was in World War Two, but things are\nhappening, and if -- if you don\u2019t listen -- for example, we -- we tried to stop it like here\nthey went to Iraq, and got Mr. Saddam Hussein Mr. Saddam Hussein would do like\nHitler do, occupy lot of countries, he probably holocaust a lot of -- a lot of people.

He was killing people, so we will be forgiven for that. But\nthat would be a holocaust if he -- he start with Kuwait, and goes Adurabi -- Abudabi,\nall those little countries. He probably kill millions of people. And so the Holocaust\ndidn -- didn\u2019t end it. During the Holocaust -- it\u2019s just -- you got small holocausts\ndifferent places to different people.
