        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay, my name is \u2014 my real name when I was born is Abraham\nResnickowitz(ph). Actually \u2014 people know him by \u2014 know me by Abe Resnick,\nactually. But that was my given name at the time, ninetee \u2014 I was born 1924,\nFebruary 27th. I was born in a small city \u2014 small town in the eastern part \u2014\nnortheastern part of Lithuania by the name of RokiSkis. It was a relatively small\ntown. It was actually a county more than a town, in the sense that there were some\nsurrounding towns \u2014 small towns which, most of the time, our town was famous in\nhaving a large \u2014 not conventions, but I would say markets. People used to come\nfrom all over because you see, Lithuania is agr \u2014 was a an agricultural\n[indecipherable] coun-country and in the larger towns we used to have twice a\nweek markets, whereby people used to bring their agricultural products to that \u2014 to\nthe \u2014 to the city and \u2014 and they were sold at the \u2014 at the markets. I was born in a\nfamily that my father, who was \u2014 who came from a different town, he was also inSeptember 22, 1994\nthe \u2014 he fought in the Independence War of Lithuania. And due to the fact that he\nwas fighting for Lithuanian suverani \u2014 sovereignty, he was given two choices; one,\na farm or a governmental job. He decided what's a Jewish boy going to do ona\nfarm? So he \u2014 he decided to take a governmental job. And the job was, basically he\nwas a inspector \u2014 insurance inspector. Insurance was, in Lithuania, a \u2014 belonged to\nthe government and regulated by the government. So he came to this small town.\nFirst of all, he came to the town, in the beginning, as a\u2014 as a bookkeeper, and he\nworked for a company. And then, of course, he met my mother who was a native,\nand a fourth or fifth or six generation of people who lived in RokiSkis. That means\nmy great-grandfather and my great-great-grandfather, they were established there\nfor \u2014 for many years. And after my father married [indecipherable] he opened up\nhis own business and the office was normally \u2014 office was in \u2014 in the house. I have\na very nice house and the address of the house \u2014 of course, that's irrelev \u2014 irrelevant.\nThen when \u2014",
        "Q: But you had a very comfortable life.",
        "A: I had \u2014 I had \u2014 I had a very comfortable life in the sense that we had a large\nfamily and we had many, many friends. We had a \u2014 a \u2014 even a Jewish bank in this \u2014\nin this town. There were out of the 6,000 people that lived in the town, I think 50\npercent were \u2014 were Jewish. And it was \u2014 had quite a few synagogues. It was a \u2014September 22, 1994\nand the town was always known \u2014 known as a Chabad town, Chabad, which was\nnow being known was as the Lubavitch. Incidentally, in 1933 the rabbi \u2014 the head\nrabbi from the Lubavitch movement came down to our town and it was a big \u2014 a\nbig event. I remember he came to the train station and he was carried through\nbecause he had a \u2014 he was handicapped. And incidentally, my parents took me to\nhim for a blessing and sometimes I say this blessing maybe was the one that saved\nme from all these difficulties that I went through my life. Now, I had a younger\nsister, and \u2014 two younger sisters. One was four years younger, the other one was\neight years younger than myself. And the cultural life was very \u2014 it was a small city\nbut it was a very \u2014 very unique in the sense of the friendship and the \u2014 had many a\nlarge, large family, plus the fact we were also close to the border of Latvia. And I\nhad a\u2014a aunt who married into Dvinsk, which was about 50, 60 miles, but it was\nalready in Latvia. So we had also relatives that used to come in between Latvia and\nLithuania. When I grew up, I went to a\u2014 to public school. My parents had said \u2014\ndecided to send me to Kovno, which was the \u2014 which was the capital at that time of\nLithuania.",
        "Q: Before we get to Kovno, I just \u2014 your \u2014 I \u2014 as I understand it, your family was\nquite religious?",
        "A: Yes, they were not that fanatics but they were \u2014 they were \u2014 the \u2014 the whole \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nyou see, the whole city, the \u2014 those small cities were very much religious. People\nwere \u2014 there were exceptions who were not religious, most \u2014 99 percent were\nreligious, and everybody used to belong to the synagogue, and there were no\nreformed or \u2014 or \u2014 or conservative. There was one type of synagogue. They were\nOrthodox synagogues at that time.",
        "Q: Did the Jewish population mix much with the \u2014",
        "A: Very \u2014 very much in the sense that they were mostly storekeepers and we had\nattorneys, and we had dentists, and we had a \u2014 like I mentioned, we had a bank.\nAnd the head of the bank was also, of course, a Jewish bank which \u2014 and the bank\nbasically, mostly was also in a sense to help need \u2014 people in need and they used to\nalso participate in \u2014 in \u2014in charity and in helping people to establish themselves in\nnew businesses.",
        "Q: Jewish and non-Jewish?",
        "A: Jewish and non-Jewish, right, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. What about political or Zionist organizations?",
        "A: There were \u2014 everybody was there a Zionist, and many people, incidentally have\n\u2014 at that time, it didn\u2019t exist yet, the State of Israel, but we had in \u2014 in quite a\nnumber of occasions, when Zionist leaders used to come down to our city to \u2014 to\nexplain the necessity of having a \u2014 having our own country and promote the ZionistSeptember 22, 1994\nideas.",
        "Q: Okay. So you were beginning to tell me about moving to \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014I moved \u2014 actually, I\u2014 I \u2014I didn't move. My family still stayed on in\nRokiSkis and \u2014 but I was sent to Kovno and that time, at the age of 12 or 13, I was\nsent to my grandparents who used to live in Kovno. And my parents felt very\ncomfortable, the fact that I\u2019m going to be living together with my grandparents and\nmy uncle. So they used to live on \u2014 almost on the main street, was \u2014 which was call\nLaisv\u00e9s al\u00e9ja. That means, in translating, the Alley of Independence. And I was\nright there on the corner of Kanto gatve and Laisv\u00e9s al\u00e9ja, and there used to live \u2014\nmy \u2014 my grandparents used to live and we were very comfortable. And the fact that\nthe school they put me in was also a gymnasium, which was about five minutes\nwalking distance from \u2014 from where they used to live. And of course, I started\ngoing to the \u2014 to the school. The \u2014 the \u2014 the schooling system was extremely well\nand this \u2014 this was the reason also they send me to Kovno, because in the small\ncities they didn't have Hebrew gymnasiums and this was a Hebrew gymnasium.\nAnd incidentally, this gymnasium was on the name of Chase because a benefactor\nby the name of Chase was the one that established \u2014 from United States, was the\none that established this gymnasium in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Kovno, the capital of\nLithuania. So I went through the \u2014 the friend that had many friends. And we \u2014 we\nSeptember 22, 1994\ndidn't have too much time, leisure time, because the system \u2014 the educational\nsystem was extremely, extremely serious, and very disciplined. We used to have\nuniforms with a hat and \u2014 and a special outfit. And we basically started early in the\nmorning, and I used to come back home late and I had to make my homework, and\nwas very, very little time to \u2014 to \u2014 for leisure. Of course, sometimes going to the\nmovies, sometimes \u2014 incidentally, I also lived next store, right around the corner to\nthe opera, which I was very \u2014 you had a \u2014 Lithuania was a small country, but it had\na very cultural \u2014 the cultural life was there, very intense. And by having the opera\naround us and especially myself and also many of our friends were very much\ninvolved in the opera. Of course, we didn't have the money and the resources to \u2014 to\n\u2014to go and sometimes to the opera, but we always find a way to participate and to\nenjoy the cultural life and especially the opera, the ballet. And it was a beautiful,\nbeautiful opera. And this was also was in a compound of a \u2014 within a park, a city\npark. I also remember that I used to read quite a lot. And there was, of course, radio,\nall what we had. And it was in the early stages. We didn't have, of course, TV or\nsome other entertainment. So mostly our activities were basically around the\ncommunity, around the synagogue, which was not too far also from us. Kovno was\na city of about I would say hundred and \u2014 hun \u2014 hundred \u2014 over 100,000 people \u2014\nout of about I would say maybe 150,000 people. Out of them, maybe one \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\none-fourth, one-third was \u2014 were \u2014 were Jewish people.",
        "Q: You were in the main part of \u2014 of Kovno?",
        "A: The main \u2014 yes, in the main part, in the \u2014 1n the center \u2014 in the center, right. And\nremember that on Saturday, of course, the \u2014 the school \u2014 were no school and we\nused to walk. We had this \u2014 Laisv\u00e9s al\u00e9ja, the street was composed of a median\nwith benches and \u2014 and a place to \u2014 to walk and \u2014 and to enjoy. The climate \u2014 the\nclimate was also very good in a certain way because of course we had a\u2014 we were\nalmost the same parallel as Montreal, but their climate was a little bit milder, in the\nsense we had very harsh winters and very beautiful summers. And we really\nenjoyed the \u2014 the surroundings. In winter, we used to go skating and \u2014 and had\nsome \u2014 and with sleds, you know, had s \u2014 very war \u2014 it used to be also beautiful in\nthe sense that we used to go out and \u2014 and had the wintertime, you know, with\nhorses and sleds and it was a remarkable \u2014 it was a very interesting and \u2014 and very\njoyful life, yeah.",
        "Q: What did the city look like?",
        "A: The city was a extremely, extremely clean city. And the buildings, we didn\u2019t\nhave any high-rise buildings there. I think the tallest building was about four \u2014\nfour-stories high. Most of them were two stories. Somewhere in the center of the\ncity, of course, there were commercial buildings and also apartment buildings. We\nSeptember 22, 1994\nhad also a number of movie theaters, and then we had a remnant from when \u2014 when\nLithuania was occupied by Russia, we had a place which was called the\nsabor(ph). The sabor(ph), that was a \u2014 a \u2014 like a church that was not functioning as\na church, but it was like a \u2014 like a remnant from the \u2014 from the tsarist times and \u2014\nand it was used, like, mostly as a museum. We had also few museums. It was also a\nmilitary museum, which was called a karo muziejus. We had \u2014 also the topography\nwas very beautiful because we had like, small mountains surrounding, and we had\ntwo rivers, the Neris and the Nemunas. And of course, wintertime was very joyful,\nthere were \u2014 when they were frozen we used to enjoy the skating and going around,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: What about Jewish life?",
        "A: Jewish life was very, very \u2014 for instance, I \u2014",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I need you to start again because I was talking.",
        "A: Yeah. I belonged to different \u2014 not different \u2014 there were not too many\norganizations \u2014 Jewish organizations, mostly Zi-Zionist. And also at the same time,\nI belonged to the international organization, which was the badin-badin(ph), which\nwere the boy scouts, which we enjoyed. We used to have outings and the outings\nwere basically \u2014 we used to go out to the forest and then stay there over \u2014 stay over.\nAnd also we were taught different \u2014 different measures in ou-our rel-\nSeptember 22, 1994\nrelationship there, I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 the essence of wha-what does it mean there,\nto be a boy scout in badin-badin(ph). We also \u2014 I remember we were taught also \u2014\nwe used to wave with flags the Morse code, you know, with \u2014 by communicating\nwhich is a \u2014 which ea \u2014 with each other by \u2014 was the little flags like between two\nships, you know. Also, I remember we were also being educated and explained\nabout the \u2014 about Palestine and about the activities that were at that time in\nPalestine, about the \u2014 the influx of the amount of Jewish people to Palestine. Also,\nabout the Ottoman times in Turkey, which were also in some \u2014 or some years ago\nthat Turkey, what \u2014 they had a very big influence on Palestine when they had \u2014\nthey were under Turkish occupation, by the Ottomans and [indecipherable]. We\nwere very extremely well versed. And life went by and I used to go back to my \u2014 in\nthe summertime, I used to go back to join my \u2014 my family to RokiSkis. I remember\nI used to take the train. It would take forever, and it was only about 200 miles. I\ndon\u2019t remember, kilometers or miles, but [indecipherable]. And then I used to join\nmy family and I was very proud. People used to respect me very much for the fact\nthat I am \u2014 I am\u2014I am coming from my big city, or \u2014 my other friends were\neducated in our small city, most of them went to Lithuanian schools. And the\nrelationship between Jews and Lithuanians was very, very cordial, you know, very\nnice, they were very friendly, and we had never had any \u2014 any big sense of\nSeptember 22, 1994\nanti-Semitism. I mean, at least we didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t feel that. Sometimes, in sporadic\ncases, in \u2014 there were certain \u2014 certain acts of hostility, but very, very rare. And\ngoing back and forth, and so we reached the time when I was \u2014 reached eight. The\nlast year was the eight class, you know, and this \u2014 this was the year when we \u2014 I\nwas going to finish the gymnasium and, of course, after gymnasium, as \u2014 as you\nknow, that a gymnasium is like a \u2014 translated in terms of here, American terms, it's\nlike a partially college \u2014 high school and college, whereby we had to take also\nlogaritmais and differentials and ma-many items that were many \u2014 such \u2014 many\nsubjects that were being taken in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in \u2014 in wi \u2014 in the university.\n[indecipherable] My \u2014 I was \u2014 I took Latin because we had \u2014 we were able to take\nsome foreign languages. I \u2014 I\u2014 I took \u2014 Russian, I spoke because when I was born\nmy parents finished Russian schools before Lithuania was independent. So I \u2014 I\nspoke, when I \u2014 in the beginning I spoke Russian. And when I went to \u2014 to school,\nand to cheder, I start speaking Yiddish, and then, of course, Hebrew and then, of\ncourse, Lithuanian. And then I took German in \u2014 in school, I had to take. And then I\ntook Latin because I \u2014 my \u2014 my interest was to become a doctor and my parents\nwanted to send me to Italy because the curriculum in \u2014 in Lithuania was very\nsmall. We had a university, not \u2014 not too big, and that was very difficult to get into\nthe university. So some friends of ours went to Italy and my aim was also to go to\nSeptember 22, 1994\nItaly after finishing gymnasium. And of course, 1939, this was still before \u2014 two\nyears before I finished gymnasium, the \u2014 the Russians \u2014 I mean, the turmoil in\nEurope started. The Russians have decided with the Ribbentrop pact, you know, to\ndivide between Germany and Russia. Russia was going to take over the Baltics;\nLithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. And Germany was take part of Poland, and \u2014 and\nof course, Czechoslovakia and Austria, so forth and so on. So it started already,\nthe feeling we \u2014 we felt that there is something \u2014 something happening, but we have\nnever \u2014 we were confident that our government is \u2014 which was a democratic\ncountry with a president, a parliament, and with quite a lot of liberty and freedom.\nBut in 1939, we have \u2014 we found out one day that we are under the Russian \u2014 the\nRussian \u2014 that the Russians have absorbed the three Baltic states and we \u2014 we have\nheard \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 that like a day or two days ahead of time that the Russian\ntanks are going to be coming into Kovno, to Lithuania. Of course, there was no\nresistance because compared to Russia, we had a small miniature army and there\nwas no way that we were able to fight Russia at that time. And \u2014 and the Russians\ntook \u2014 I remember when they \u2014 when they marched into Lithuania. And right away\nwhen they marched in \u2014 you see, our gymnasium was a Hebrew gymnasium. So\nwhen the Russians came in, they changed their \u2014 right away they eliminate \u2014",

        "A: We didn\u2019t give them permission. [break]",
        "Q: How \u2014 how did, in Slobodka especially, that was a very important center of\nJewish life, and I would like to \u2014",
        "A: The Yeshivot. The biggest Yeshiva, yeah, right, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 get a little more detail of \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but can I continue? And then tha \u2014 that was \u2014 make it brief and then \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Right, so the Russians came and when they came in, they changed the whole\nsystem. First of all, suddenly from a democracy, we became a part of the Soviet\nUnion, a republic. And right away they started changing the currency. They brought\nin many military personnel. They start taking over and nationalize the businesses.\nThey \u2014 in my \u2014 in RokiSkis, my parents were told that the \u2014 the house is too big, too\nluxury for \u2014 for \u2014 for a family, that we have to take in some families. And they put\nin some families in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the house. They \u2014 our business what \u2014 we had a\nfactory of roofing paper, which was not too big so they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t do\nanything about that. But in Kaunas \u2014 in Kovno, they started nationalizing the big\nbusinesses and they start taking out those people who they felt they are not\nsympathetic with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the Russian government and that they had\nsome \u2014 some kind of history that they were exploiting people. They start taking\nSeptember 22, 1994\nthem out \u2014 taking them to Russia. I remember that, being still in school, I was given\nthe assignment to nationalize a large \u2014 a large wholesale food business, which all\nkinds of items there, and we had to take the inventory. And then, of course, the \u2014\nthe owners were placed temporarily to be the managers and then they were kicked\nout basically, from those businesses. So, in \u2014 in \u2014 in RokiSkis, they also start taking\nout those people who they considered that they are bourgeois. And fortunately my \u2014\nmy parents had very good contacts within the Lithuanian community. Father speak\nperfect Lithuanian, and as I mentioned, he was in the army, so they didn\u2019t touch\nhim. But some of our relatives, they took them out and they send them to Russia,\nand those people had very difficult time but they have \u2014 they \u2014 they were fortunate\nin a certain way. And I'm going later to relate to you, that they were fortunate being\n\u2014 when they were taken to Russia, rather than stay on. So going back to Kaunas,\nwe had \u2014 Kaunas was a, as I mentioned, not a very large city but we had some\nsuburbs. One of them was Slobodka, which was called Vilijampol\u00e9 in Lithuanian.\nAnd this was a center of Jewish learning. There were \u2014",
        "Q: Stand by please. [break]",
        "A: People used to come \u2014 students used to come from all over \u2014 all over the world\nto be educated in those yeshivots, which were in Slobodka, which is \u2014 Slobodka\nyeshiva was like a something \u2014 a special place of \u2014 of learning, which many, many\nSeptember 22, 1994\nbig scholars have come out from \u2014 from there \u2014 from this yeshiva. We had another\nyeshiva [indecipherable] Ponevezh, but Slobodka was the \u2014 like the \u2014 the crown\nof the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the learning institutions. And most of the people, it was a \u2014 most\nof Slobodka was comprised of a Jewish population, middle lower class. But people\nwere comfortable. There was not \u2014 nobody was hungry, especially, as I mentioned\nthat Lithuania was an agricultural country. So there was never a shortage of meat\nand \u2014 and bread and \u2014 and some other products like butter and milk, and that. So\nSlobodka was very much considered as a \u2014 a very, very unique and very special\nplace, not only in Lithuania, like I mentioned, but throughout the \u2014 throughout the\nwestern hemisphere.",
        "Q: Did you spend time in Slobodka as well?",
        "A: I spend very little time because I was more to \u2014 our gymnasium was not a \u2014 not\nan extreme religious organization. We spoke Hebrew, we observed the holidays, but\nwe were not fanatics like I mentioned. We \u2014",

A\ncommunistic system, socialistic system, they call that. And it was, in the beginning,\nwe felt \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel too good about it but then we got used to it. Because\nespecially at the age of 16 \u2014 15, 16, 17, truthfully, we have not \u2014 we were still not \u2014\nhad the burden of carrying on a family and make a living and we \u2014 we were just\nsitting there and watching the changes which happened very, very fast. We saw also\nmany fortifications have become \u2014 have been taken over by the \u2014 of course, the\nRussians have displayed their force. We had a airport which was about \u2014 about\nseven or eight miles from \u2014 from our city. And of course, we didn\u2019t have a\nmilitary \u2014 military planes. I think we had one or two of them. That was considered a\nsizable amount for \u2014 for the \u2014 for the military in Lithuania.

        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 the life, the Jewish life in Kovno, and in general Lithuania, changed\nvery drastically, and very dramatically, because we were used to belong la \u2014 to\nbelong to our organizations, Zionistic organizations. These became taboo. That is a\nvery offensive in the Russian \u2014 in the Soviet system, to belong to organizations\nwhich are not within their framework. They \u2014 right away, they expelled all the\nteachers, all the Hebrew teachers, and suddenly we became, rather than a Hebrew\nschool, we became a Yiddish school. Yiddish for them was like the \u2014 main\nlanguage, truthfully, was Yiddish, but Hebrew for them, was \u2014 they had certain\nsuspicions that Hebrew is a little bit too closer to the \u2014 they considered those who\nspoke Hebrew like fascists, in a certain way. So, it was not easy to get transformed\n\u2014 to change sud-suddenly, and \u2014 and \u2014 and especially for us kids, you know, it was\n\u2014 although everybody spoke Yiddish, but the \u2014 the \u2014 the reason why I was sent to\nthis gymnasium was not \u2014 because home we spoke Yiddish, was to learn, and to \u2014\nto get acquainted with \u2014 with Hebrew, and not with Yiddish. But we had to obey\nand do whatever the government has instructed us to do. Now \u2014",

        "A: They were not closed. They were not closed. They still kept them open, but they\nSeptember 22, 1994\nwere under very tight scrutinity(ph). And they watched very much who is going to\nthe synagogue, and who is \u2014 and whether there is some counter-revolutionary \u2014\nsome kind of feeling or sentiments towards something which is not in the \u2014 in the\nscope of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the Soviet theory. Now, in meantime, time was going on\nand the happenings in Europe were very traumatic, and \u2014 and very drastic.\nCzechoslovakia fell. We suddenly had an influx of checs \u2014 Czechoslovakian \u2014\nCzechoslovakian refugees. Some of them \u2014 many of them Jewish, who came \u2014 and\nthey came actually to RokiSkis, not to Kaunas. They were afraid to go to the large\ncities, cause they were afraid to be interned, and then sent back to \u2014 to\nCzechoslovakia. And they start telling us about \u2014 first of all, it was very hard for us\nto \u2014 to bring them in, because they \u2014 they were \u2014 they came in illegally. But we\nprovided them \u2014 first of all, we took them to a synagogue, and we made them\ncomfortable there, and there, little by little, we spread them out to different family\nhouses. And they start telling us about the horrors, about what Hitler is doing to the\nJewish population, and especially in Czechoslovakia. And most of those people\nwho came, were very intelligent people, like one of them was a \u2014 I remember very\nvividly, one was a painter, and his paintings was fantastic. I remember even that he\nhelped me to paint some \u2014 I had to make the \u2014 to make a thesis about certain \u2014\ncertain things in \u2014 1n school, and he helped me to, with a \u2014 with a \u2014 with the\n20September 22, 1994\npaintings, whereby he \u2014 he was actually a perfect painter, you know, that. The other\none, I remember the name, one was Foyer(ph) Opataker(ph), the other one was a\nbusinessman who lost his business, and he a \u2014 was able to escape, just by himself.\nHe was not able even to bring his family. They \u2014 then we had also influx from \u2014\nfrom Polish refugees, who came \u2014 especially Polish military people, who interned\nthemselves. But this \u2014 they \u2014 they came in actually legally \u2014 not I \u2014 they \u2014 I mean\nthey \u2014 they crossed the border, and then they surrendered. So, of course their arms\nwere taken away, and \u2014 and they were placed in a \u2014 in\u2014 I remember in a \u2014 1n the\ncenter of the city, that was in RokiSkis. And I remember seeing them with their \u2014\nwhere they took \u2014 care more on \u2014 they were more concerned about their boots and\ntheir uniforms than about some other \u2014 other things, you know.",
        "Q: Excuse me, I thi \u2014 you\u2019re hearing that moving around in the kitchen? [break]",
        "A: So this \u2014 this affected us, as youngsters, affected us very much, and \u2014 and we\nstarted listening to their stories, and \u2014 and then the horror stories that were \u2014 about\nthe killings, about the rapes, about the robberies, about the \u2014 and \u2014 and we just \u2014 I\nremember I just was sitting, like I\u2019m sitting now in the armchair, and listening to\nwhat they had to say. But of course, after I listen to their stories, I went \u2014 I had my\nfood, and I had my \u2014 my room, and my bed, and the next day I got involved again in\nmy daily duties. So, it affected us, but what we have not \u2014 we \u2014 we s \u2014 we should \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nlooking in retrospect, we should have been a little bit more concerned, and more\ncareful, and \u2014 which, we didn\u2019t do that, and \u2014",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t think this was going \u2014",
        "A: We didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t think that this was going to expand. We felt that we are\nnow very well protected under the Soviet regime, which Soviet Russia was\nconsidered \u2014 I \u2014 a stronghold, you know, and the \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, and we felt that\nwe re \u2014 we\u2019re 1n the safe side. In the meantime, in \u2014 in our house was also we were\n\u2014 we were compelled to take in some bor \u2014 some tenants, and one of them was a\u2014a\n\u2014 was a Russian pilot. There was one pilot, and then they joined the other one. And\nwe had to give up one of the rooms, and they \u2014 and they were there together with\nus. And I finished the gymnasium, we got ready to go back home, but for some\nreason, the certificates of completion were not made available. So I felt rather than\nto go back home, and I \u2014 I was very proud that I finish without any \u2014 any problems\n\u2014I was not one of the best teacher \u2014 students, but I \u2014 I did my homework, and I \u2014 I\nnever failed from one year to the other one. So I was waiting for to get a certificate\nin order to be able to come home, and to bring the sa \u2014 say I-I finished, and\ngraduated, and I\u2019m ready to go to university. So this was in the middle of June. And\nthey told me that the certificates are going to be finished by June \u2014 by the later part\nof June, and I felt I\u2019m going to stay for a few more days. You know, school hasSeptember 22, 1994\nfinished. The summer was there, and it was nice, and we got a little bit more used to\nthe \u2014 to the \u2014 to our new system, and came June 21\", nighttime, and suddenly we\nhad a\u2014 we heard a\u2014 some movement in the \u2014 in the room, from the two pilots that\nwe had. And they suddenly, middle of the night, they run out, without saying\nanything. They disappeared. And a little while later we heard bombings, we heard\nplanes. And we put on the radio, and this was the invasion of the second \u2014 actually\nthe \u2014 the Nazi part of the second World War started. Whereby that Hitler didn\u2019t\nannounce, without announcing, he just \u2014 he starts \u2014 start the invasion. And he\nactually deceived anybody, because there were no massed troops on the borders that\ntime. He just tried to get this war started, and \u2014 and \u2014 and started war by surprise.\nAnd it was really a surprise, because no \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody was \u2014 was ready for\nthat. Everybody was living with the dreams that they had this Ribbentrop pact, it\nwas Molotov, and \u2014 and that both parts were satisfied that there is no \u2014 we \u2014 we\nleaned more to the fact that we thought that he is going to \u2014 if he 1s going to attack,\nhe is going to go against England, rather than \u2014 than \u2014 it was a \u2014 a incredible\nsurprise. So, right away it \u2014 I remember my house, we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what\nto do. We had also a other tenant, which I didn\u2019t mention before, that was \u2014 yeah?\nWhat \u2014 what \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] which I didn\u2019t mention \u2014\n23September 22, 1994",
        "A: Okay, fine, eliminate it. We had a other tenant that was in the \u2014 in the \u2014 worked\nin the transportation. And he told us right away that there is a truck going to be\navailable if we want \u2014 we want to go, but we were so confused, and everybody \u2014 we\nsaw masses of soldiers, Russian soldiers running from one place to the other one.\nThey bombed \u2014 basically, when they started bombing, they bombed the airport, and\nthen certain military objectives. And the \u2014 the whole city became a \u2014 a \u2014 a turmoil.\nAnd we also heard about, through the radio, they start announcing that Germany\nhas attacked the Soviet Union, and wir \u2014 that \u2014 the Lithuanians are \u2014 this was still\nwith the Russians there, that the Lithuanians are very much in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014in\nfavor of \u2014 of reading and \u2014 and receiving the \u2014 the victorious \u2014 the victorious\nGerman troops. When I \u2014 I wanted to reach my house, because I \u2014 I felt to \u2014 to unite\nmyself with the family. And I start running on the \u2014 in the highway, with my\nbicycle. I got my bicycle, and \u2014 and when I came to a certain point, I saw people\ncoming towards us and said, return, because there is atrocities on the highway. They\n\u2014 they fly low, the German airplanes, and they \u2014 and they just kill everybody that is\non there, on the highways. From time to time you have to run off and \u2014 and throw\nyourself on \u2014 on the ground, because the \u2014 the massacres are just incredible,\nespecially in \u2014 because, you see the civilians, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 the Russians were\nalso \u2014 they were mixed. They were running together. Many Russian trucks, they \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nright away they \u2014 they \u2014 they start abandoning their military supplies, and military\nbarracks, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they just try to move eastward, you know, towards \u2014\ntowards Russia. And this was so dramatic, and we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know. We had\nsome relatives on the \u2014 we had a \u2014 that was called a \u2014 the klininbar(ph), that\u2019s the \u2014\nthe green \u2014 the Green Mountain. That was a \u2014 a place within \u2014 within Kovno where\nwe had some relatives who \u2014 who \u2014 from my aunt\u2019s part, who lived there. We felt\nmaybe to go to them, there in that place maybe would be safer. So we went up\nthere, and then we came back to our \u2014 to our apartment, feel the safest place is to\nstay in the apartment. Killings started, and especially Lithuanians, where they were\nvery bo \u2014 very much against \u2014 against the Soviets. They hated the Soviets, you\nknow, from the beginning. So \u2014 and they considered that there are some Jewish\npeople were in the communists, and \u2014 and they \u2014 right away they wanted to take\nvengeance, you know, and what they did is, they right away start killing people,\nstart torturing them, start \u2014 there was a s \u2014 a special \u2014 a special torture chamber,\nwhich was made to a \u2014 to a torture chamber, which was made in a \u2014 one of their gas\nstations. They brought in about 20 people, and they put hoses in their mouth, and\nthey \u2014 and they start water pressuring. And they just killed them with the \u2014 with\nthat. I mean, there were so \u2014 such atrocity that beyond \u2014 beyond description. And\nthe Germans were not in yet. The ger \u2014 Germans were still \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 you see,\n25September 22, 1994\nthe Germans, they had their tactics of the surrounding in a ring, and then closing up\nin the ring, an-and \u2014 and coming to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the focal point where they were\ngoing to occupy. The \u2014 for the Russians it was a incredible shock what happened,\nand they \u2014 they were really not prepared and not ready for the oncoming victorious\nGerman troops. There were also announcements in the radio two days later, where it\nsaid that \u2014 it was in Lithuanian, in Russian, and in German, what said that \u2014 but\nbasically highlighting in Lithuanian. The victorious German troops are coming, are\nclose to Kovno, they are going to enter Kovno in \u2014 in the next hours, and we have\nnoticed that some snipers, and some communists, and some Jews have \u2014 are\nresisting, and shooting against them. So we want to mention that for each German\nsoldier that is going to be killed \u2014 that\u2019s going to be killed \u2014 hundred Jews or\ncommunists are going to be taken and shot, without \u2014 without any \u2014 any question.\nAnd this was constantly, and \u2014 and constantly in the radio. So we \u2014 we felt already,\nwe knew what \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s coming and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t realize that we felt,\nmaybe after Kovno is going to be taken over by the Germans, maybe they are going\nto establish their \u2014 their rules, and they are going to be more human than \u2014 than the\nLithuanians, but this was not the case, and they occupied Kovno. Then suddenly,\nevery day they used to make \u2014 promulgate a \u2014 a new decree. One decree, the first\none was that all Jews have to bring into the kommandantur any arms, if they hadSeptember 22, 1994\nany \u2014 any \u2014 any radios. Any watches. Anything, right away. Then there came a\nsecond decree, that the Jews cannot walk on the sidewalk, they have to walk on the\n\u2014 on the \u2014 on the street side. Third decree was that you have to give up all your \u2014 all\n\u2014 all the valuables. If you have some jewelry, some \u2014 some \u2014 any kind, any type of\njewelry, stamps \u2014 I had a big collection of stamps, myself. I had to take my stamps\nand take it over to the \u2014 to the kommandantur. And that was considered \u2014",
        "Q: How would they know that you had it?",
        "A: You know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the remedy, and they \u2014 they \u2014 what \u2014 what they s \u2014 they\nstressed is, if by any chance we spot check, and we found that after this \u2014 they give\nyou like 24 hours, or 48 hours to return all the \u2014 all the valuables. If they spot\ncheck, and they find somebody that has something what they \u2014 what the decree was\nabout, they would take him out and shoot him right away. So no \u2014 nobody had \u2014 I\nthink most of the people didn\u2019t want to \u2014 well, want to risk \u2014 of course, we risked,\nand \u2014 and it was a \u2014 it was like taking your \u2014 your life in your hands. But in the\nbeginning, you \u2014 you didn\u2019t know what \u2014 what it \u2014 what it \u2014 to do, or not to do,\nbecause we \u2014 now, the last decree was that all Jews have \u2014 that was already a month\nlater, in August, that all Jews have to come, and they\u2019re making a ghetto, surr-\nsurrounded by barbed wire, and this ghetto, all the Jews have to trans-transport\nthemselves, for their own means, get us a horse and buggy, and \u2014 and travel to the\n27September 22, 1994\nghetto, which is in Vilijampol\u00e9, in Slobodka. This is where they decided, because\nthey were originally a Jewish population, and those Lithuanians who were living\nthere, have to give up their houses, and they were going to be resettled in some\nother houses, which were left by \u2014 by \u2014 by the Jews. I mean, that was like quid pro\nquo \u2014 pro quo, you know, they exchange. So right away we started looking for a \u2014\nfor a place, and there was also on first come, first move in basis. But of course,\nthere were certain \u2014 they give you certain parameters, whereby that if you take \u2014 if\nyou can\u2019t work out with a Lithuanian some kind of deal, whereby you can give him\nyour house, and give him some nice furniture, and on top of that give him\nsomething extra, what \u2014 and we were fortunate to find a \u2014 a house in Linkuvos\ngatve, I think it was, number 45, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And we found a house, but the\nhouse was \u2014 it was a house, but in the house you had to \u2014 you \u2014 you were able just\nonly \u2014 only about four or five people to occupy only one room. And the rest of the\nrooms were distributed to some \u2014 some other people.",
        "Q: Who was in your \u2014 who was staying with you?",
        "A: With us was staying a\u2014 my uncle, my aunt \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. I want you to start that sentence, I was living with my \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 the house that we were moved in, in Slobodka in the ghetto was my\nuncle; my aunt; my cousin, who was two years old at that time \u2014 or one and a halfSeptember 22, 1994\nyear; my grandmother. That was in \u2014 in one \u2014 in one room. Then in the other rooms\nwas a\u2014 arelative, a brother of my aunt, with his wife, with a little baby. In the other\nrooms were two ladies, a older lady, a younger name \u2014 by the name of\nLondonski(ph), and their daughter. So we were like three families, in a very little\ntiny-miney house, you know. We had a small yard, we had \u2014 the facilities were not\nin the house, they were outside. I had some water, and we had some certain things\nthat we brought along with us, except for valuables. And this, when we\u2019re \u2014 when\nthey closed the ghetto \u2014 that was in the beginning \u2014 the right way, when they closed\nthe ghetto, they wanted to show their \u2014 their \u2014 that they \u2014 they mean business, so\nwhat they took is one \u2014 one guy that apparently they claimed that he hadn't\ncomplied with the \u2014 with the rules, they took him out and they publicly hanged him.\nAnd he was hanging for about a week. So everybody in the center of the \u2014 of the\nghetto in \u2014 everybody that came by should have si \u2014 looked at \u2014 his name was\nMac(ph), and I think \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that \u2014 I\u2019m not I\u2019m sure, but I know that\nKalish(ph) has a picture from that, which she took with this candid camera.",
        "Q: So you walked by this?",
        "A: We had to walk by \u2014 by this man hanging for about a week. Week\u2019s a long time\nnow. When we came into the ghetto, right away they establish \u2014 they start again\nwith all kind of tricks, playing with us. The first \u2014 the first decree was that they\nSeptember 22, 1994\nneed 500 educated intel \u2014 intelligentsia \u2014 intelligent people, who finished the\ngymnasium, and they need them for a very special task. They need them right away,\nand you have to \u2014 you have to come in by certain hour, in a certain place in the\ncenter of the ghetto. So, everybody was \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] noise. I do want to hear the story, but airplanes. Do you want \u2014\n[break] I\u2019m hearing a lot of noise, you\u2019re not hearing \u2014 it\u2019s not bad? Okay.",
        "A: So, they came out with a new decree, and this was to get five \u2014 they needed 500",
        "Q: Can you start that and say, the Germans came up with \u2014",
        "A: The Germans \u2014 the Germans, soon they closed the ghetto \u2014 [bells] [break] \u2014\nshould have thought of that, it\u2019s right after this \u2014 after the decree. The Germans\nhave promulgated a decree, whereby that they need 500 immediately, for a very\nspecial task, 500 educated intelligentsia people who were \u2014 had certain level of\neducation. In order to be able to comply with this \u2014 with this special requirement.\nAnd everybody was some kind, you know, just came into the ghetto, and \u2014 and we\nwere short on food, and then they also promised that they are going to be rewarded,\nvery much re \u2014 very properly rewarded with \u2014 with food that \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody\nspoke about money. Money was irrelevant at that time. The \u2014 the basic thing was\nfood, food and food, you know. So everybody was rushing. My uncle \u2014 my aunt\u2019s\n30September 22, 1994\nbrother told me that he would like to \u2014 he would like to go, and he had just to \u2014 he\nwas in process of shaving or something, that I should wait for him few minutes. I\nwas not too familiar with the ghetto yet, because it was split up in such a way, and I\nwas never that \u2014 in that section of the city, maybe once or twice in my lifetime,\nbecause I had also a \u2014 a football place, where my Maccabi(ph) used to play there,\nin Slobodka, and my uncle \u2014 one of my uncles was a very, very good football\nplayer, so I\u2014 sometimes, you know, I was \u2014 but this was a new situation. So, I\ndidn\u2019t know, and we were a little bit nervous, in the sense we wanted to be there on\ntime. We didn\u2019t have \u2014 we didn\u2019t have watches, you know, we had to look at the\nsun, and to approximately make sure that we\u2019re in the right time. We \u2014 we start\ngoing, looking for a \u2014 for a place where they \u2014 where we were supposed to get, and\nwe got there like 10 minutes late. There were already 506 people, were already up\nthis \u2014 fulfill this assignment, this projected amount of people, and the \u2014 the\nGermans were satisfied, and you know, Germans are very meticulous and punctual.\nAnd they said, we have already the amount, and you go back, we don\u2019t need you\nany more. So we were a little disappointed, you know, we came back. In meantime,\nwhat happened within the \u2014 in the time that the Jews start moving to the ghetto, they\nwere marry \u2014 many atrocities committed by Lithuanians. I mean, they were \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were \u2014 just became so barbaric, and without any \u2014 any \u2014 any reason,September 22, 1994\nyou know. They \u2014 they start killing, raping, an-and taking away all kind of \u2014 all\nkind of items that belonged to \u2014 to the Jewish people, you know, when they \u2014 when\n\u2014 every time we moved, when we moved to the \u2014 to the Green Mountain, we were\ngoing to my aunt\u2019s brother\u2019s house. He had there a little farm, and we felt we\u2019re\ngoing to go over there, and we\u2019re going to be able to have some food, because he\nhad \u2014 the farm still belonged to him. So, when we went there, there were \u2014\nnighttime came in, and a group of like three or four people with their guns, and they\nstarted taking away everything, whatever we \u2014 and \u2014 and my uncle stood up for\nthem, so they hit him with their \u2014 with their \u2014 with their rifle butt, you know.",
        "Q: Sorry to keep breaking up the story, but \u2014 [break]",
        "A: So we felt very, very defenseless, because there were no \u2014 nobody to protect\nanybody. I mean, it was a completely chaos and everyone did \u2014 whoever had a gun\n\u2014I mean, he was the one that \u2014 similar to what\u2019s happened now in Haiti. Whoever\nhad a gun, he was \u2014 he was able to do what \u2014 what \u2014 what he wished, you know.\nThere were no \u2014 no \u2014 absolutely \u2014 the Germans have not taken over yet. They \u2014\nthey were in, but they mind their own business, and they let Lithuanians to enjoy\nthemselves, doing what they did. And it was \u2014 was terrible things they have done.\nThey have taken people to their \u2014 to their \u2014 to \u2014 to a prison. And there was also a\nteacher of my \u2014 I remember [indecipherable] Goldman(ph), a familiar name. He\n32September 22, 1994\nwas our English teacher. He was himself from South Africa. And he was a\ncompulsive smoker, so the \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t give him any \u2014 anything to smoke, so he\nused to get the small ration of \u2014 of bread, he used to exchange that for \u2014 for\ncigarettes. And he finally succumbed, he died, you know, because he \u2014 he just \u2014 his\nbody wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t resist it. But beside the beatings, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the terror that they \u2014 they have implanted him in was \u2014 it was just\nterrible. It was a case which \u2014 I have to describe that \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 a Russian tank failed\nto \u2014 when they were \u2014 by escaping, they \u2014 they just \u2014 he was right next to the \u2014 next\nto the river, the Nemunas. For some reason, I mean, he emerged in \u2014 in water, and\ngot stuck there. They caught about 20 people, they put them like \u2014 like \u2014 like\nhorses, you know, to pull out a t\u2014 how can 20 people pull out a tank, which is who\nknows how many tons is the weight of the tank, and they just hit \u2014 hit the people, hit\nthe people, til mo-most of them were blooded, and \u2014 and \u2014 and were \u2014 were fainted,\nyou know, in the \u2014 that \u2014 that was the \u2014 that was the situation. So one \u2014 1n a certain\nway, when we came into the ghetto, we felt a little bit safer in our surrounding. We\nknew that \u2014 that there are going to be \u2014 we \u2014 we predicted, we anticipated some\natrocities, but \u2014 but at least they were going to be in a\u2014 in a\u2014 1n a\u2014 1n a certain \u2014 in\na certain \u2014 done in a certain way. We with \u2014 with some kind of order, no-not with \u2014\nnot \u2014 not just as sporadic, you know. So \u2014\n33September 22, 1994",
        "Q: What about \u2014 what about the \u2014 some of the massacres outside of the city, in the\nvery beginning?",
        "A: No, those people who were running, and who came, who try to come back, I\nmean there\u2019s \u2014 most of them were \u2014 were just killed in the \u2014 on the highways, and\nthey \u2014 they would just come into a house, they would \u2014 people who still didn\u2019t\ncome together. Because the process to come into the ghetto was like a 30 day\nprocess. So they used to assault them, and then take away all their \u2014 whatever their\n\u2014 their \u2014 whatever they had, their packages, their suitcases, their valises, and \u2014 and\nthey used to, in many cases people would kill them, in order just not to take them,\nbecause they used to take them out and \u2014 and shoot them in the outside, so \u2014",
        "Q: But weren\u2019t there some \u2014",
        "A: There were also \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 systematic \u2014",
        "A: There were systematic. There were also a \u2014 they were called the Sauliai. That\nwas a Lithuanian organization which are like \u2014 they were called like \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they were made \u2014 their make-up was from the \u2014 from \u2014 they were not \u2014\nnot army people, but it was like organization who used the uniform of sha \u2014 Sauliai\nwas like the \u2014 like the \u2014 they were called like the riflemen. And then these people\nwould exert incredible, incredible hatred, and \u2014 and hate, an-and they would come\n34\nSeptember 22, 1994\nout and \u2014 and do all kind of atrocities, you know. And they \u2014 they were able to do\nanything they wanted, because the \u2014 because the Germans would let them do that,\nbecause they felt that they are, in a certain way, that they are pleasing them, and\nthey \u2014 they were going to have them on their side when \u2014 when \u2014 when they need it.\nAnd this was actually a fact, because most of the \u2014 of the massacres were done by th\n\u2014 by the Lithuanians under \u2014 under the supervision \u2014 certain supervision of the\nGermans.",

        "A: I\u2014I saw the \u2014 because I was almost trapped in this \u2014 when \u2014 when they \u2014 what\nhad happened with the tank, you know? I saw that, it was in my vicinity. And then\nthe \u2014 my uncle was very smart, he actually took the \u2014 I mean, he took the position to\nsit in-inside the apartment, then we have to [indecipherable] to sit inside. And\nfortunately, we were living in a\u2014 in a place where were \u2014 there were not many\nJewish people there. And the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the manager of this place, because it was\nmostly offices, and the manager of the place was very, very nice Lithuanian guy,\nyou know, exceptional. And he would not \u2014 they came, I mean, a few occasions, to\nask him whether there\u2019s some Jews living there, and he would say that, not to his\nknowledge, you know. I mean, he \u2014 he actually saved us, you know. It wouldn\u2019t be\nfor him, we would be [indecipherable]. But the first days, I mean, it was a\ncomplete [indecipherable]. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 I had myself, have \u2014 have seen\npeople beaten and \u2014 and \u2014 and hurt, and especially what happened in Lietiikis with\nthis \u2014 with this horses, you know. This was a \u2014 we \u2014 we have a\u2014 we \u2014 we have seen\nnot exactly what happened there, but we have seen the \u2014 well, the way they took in\nthe people, and \u2014 and we \u2014 we know for a fact, I mean, I \u2014 there were also picturesSeptember 22, 1994\nabout it. But they \u2014 they have \u2014 there were a few thousand people who were \u2014 who\nwere documented as \u2014 as killed in the first \u2014 in the first few days. And these were\npeople that \u2014 that they s \u2014 not only they run to the highway, but people who were\njust systematically taken out from their houses. They went with their list, apparently\nthey had a list of \u2014 of addresses, would take them out and then just \u2014 not \u2014 it \u2014 it wa\n\u2014 shooting was not th-the \u2014 the great part, but \u2014 but to torture, all kind of ways of\ntorturing, you know, like chopping off a arm, a-and especially also with children.\nThat was terrible, and all, but what they have done with \u2014 with children, like\nsmashing them against the wall, or \u2014 and most of the time they were drunk, you\nknow. Because for one thing is the Lithuanians knew \u2014 I mean, they were very\neducated in \u2014 in drinking. They used to made \u2014 make a lot of homemake \u2014\nhomemade vodka. It was called samagonda(ph), it was made from potatoes. And\nthis was, like in the times of prohibition, you know, th-this \u2014 this was \u2014 you know,\ndue to the fact of the climate, that we have a cold climate, there are very many,\nmany drunks on the \u2014 on the streets. There were always many drunks, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand this drinking didn\u2019t help the situation in the beginning, because they had that\navailable, they \u2014 they took over some places where there were all kinds of \u2014 of\nliquor, an-and \u2014 and wine, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they would empty this out, and th \u2014 th-\nthis \u2014 this was also something that they had in common with the Russians, who\nSeptember 22, 1994\nwere also very good in that, you know, in drinking. So th-that \u2014 they had the first \u2014\nthe first few days there were numerous amounts of \u2014 of people that were \u2014 they\nwere counted possibly in the couple thousands of them, yeah.",
        "Q: How did they \u2014 was there a way that they selected \u2014 I mean, did they\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: They \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had lists. They \u2014 they came out \u2014 apparently\nsomebody submitted them, they had lists with addresses, and they \u2014 and beside that,\neven they didn\u2019t have a list, they used to come in, smash in, break into the door, and\nsay \u2014 and they would right away spot who is who. And there was something else.\nSomething else I have to mention is that right after \u2014 after we were \u2014 after the\nGermans came in, they came about 15 \u2014 two weeks afterwards, we had to start\nusing the yellow stars. This was a \u2014 first, in the beginning on the front, and then we\nhad to use them front and back. And they cannot be clipped in, they had to be sewn\nin, cause clipped in they claim that you can take it off, and so \u2014 so they, right away\nthey knew how to identify. And there was also a very strict order, those people who\nwouldn\u2019t wear a \u2014 a\u2014a Jewish star, they would not ask any more questions. That\nwould be the \u2014 the end of \u2014 of those \u2014 this person that would not carry the \u2014 the star.\nSo \u2014",
        "Q: How did you feel about wearing that?\n38September 22, 1994",
        "A: About?",
        "Q: How did you feel about wearing the star?",
        "A: First, in the beginning I felt like I\u2014 like I\u2014 I have a chip on my shoulder, you\nknow. But then you \u2014 you get used, you know, we\u2019re in \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019 re creatures of\n\u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of nature, of \u2014 of getting \u2014 getting used to things, you know, after \u2014 there\nis [indecipherable] saying, I mean, that you sleep over one night with a problem,\nand the next morning, I mean, there \u2014 there\u2019s no problem, th-th-the \u2014 your \u2014 th-then\nyou have already a other problem, which \u2014 which comes across, you know, but so \u2014\nand that\u2019s true, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 in a certain way we \u2014 there was also a question why\n\u2014 why we didn\u2019t resist. There were some \u2014 some cases of resistance. There was a\ncase of a schoolmate of mine, his name was Discant(ph), that he dressed himself as\na \u2014 as a German officer, and \u2014 [interruption, break] He \u2014 he \u2014 there were formed,\nsmall groups of resistance, really in \u2014 were in the forming. They were a little older\nthan myself, they were a little more mature. Those who \u2014 who started \u2014 who started\norganizing. And there was a friend of mine, already a friend that we used to \u2014 he\nused to come to my house, and we used to \u2014 to not only go to school together, but to\nhave some and certain things in common, you know. So he \u2014 he was dressed as a \u2014\ndressed a German officer, and they \u2014 they were supposed to escape to the forest,\nyou know, to pro at \u2014 I mean, to institute their resistance. And apparently the guy,September 22, 1994\nthe chauffeur that\u2019s supposed to take them, betrayed them. And then \u2014 and that was\nalready not the Lithuanians, but the Germans caught them, and they took them to\nthe Gestapo and they shot them, all of the, you know, there were like 14 people and\none of \u2014 he was one of those. So there were start \u2014 and the question is, why didn\u2019t\nyou have resistance. Because the Russian army that was there, and they had their \u2014\ntheir \u2014 their arms, and they were not resisting, because they saw the handwriting on\nthe wall, they saw what actually happened, they saw the might. And when the \u2014 I\nremember the day the Germans came in, and I looked through the window. My\nuncle used to pull me back, I shouldn\u2019t look through the window, because an-any\nmoment, I mean, somebody can shot \u2014 shoot you, you know. Tha \u2014 when they came\nin, and they \u2014 and they paraded in the street, they came in clean, with their boots\nshining, you could \u2014 like mirrors, you know, and with loudspeakers. Ahead of them\nwere Lithuanians who were pronouncing that the victorious German army is\ncoming in, that they \u2014 this is only a \u2014 are going to be established here. But the army\nis going to move on, and \u2014 and finish with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the Soviets, and it\u2019s\na matter only of a short time. They expect to do that within the summer. That was \u2014\nthat was June. So they figured, June, July, August, September, October gets ready.\nSo they \u2014 they thought their \u2014 they were projecting to occupy the Soviet Union\nabout four or four months, you know, which they \u2014 Napoleon was not able to doSeptember 22, 1994\nthat also, you know. He had the same \u2014 the same pattern. But resisting, I \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\nwas \u2014 everybody was on the shock, you know. And \u2014 and normally, we people were\nnot ready for \u2014 for resisting. We have never had an-anything, any training in \u2014 in \u2014\nin \u2014 in arms. When I know that later on, I\u2019m going to tell you that \u2014 which I hi \u2014\nwill tell you now, that I used to, in many cases I used to take off my \u2014 my stars, and\n\u2014 and then used to go out and I was blondish, I didn\u2019t look too much as \u2014 well, non-\nJewish, and I used to go out and \u2014 and trade certain things in order to get \u2014 to get\nsome food, because their f \u2014 the food situation became very critical, very critical.\nAs soon they took us into the ghetto, they \u2014 they started in \u2014 they started taking\nbrigades, they were called brigades. When a brigadier creates \u2014 they instituted a \u2014a\npolice, a Jewish police was in the ghetto, and then they instituted also the \u2014 a Jewish\ncouncil. So, first of all they were \u2014 had to repair to fix the airports. So everybody\nwas compelled to go out in the morning, five o\u2019clock in the morning had to be in the\nreunion place, and then they used to come and \u2014 with guards, and \u2014 and walk to the\n\u2014 to the airport. So I remember they used to give us 200 grams of bread, and I used\nto put it in the pocket, an-and by the time I came to the \u2014 to the airport, and when\nthey used to give us some soup, which was made of water, and well, with some \u2014\nsome vegetables, some kind of this [indecipherable] vegetables, you know. And\nthey used to boil that, and by that time I didn\u2019t have really bread, because walking, I\nSeptember 22, 1994\n\u2014I used to chew off on the portion of bread. So the situation of \u2014 the food situation\nbecame very \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the duration was very, very bigger. And we \u2014 we had to\ntrade sometimes, certain objects with the \u2014 with Lithuanians. So, in the beginning,\nthey used to let the \u2014 we were able to do that, but there were some \u2014 some people\nwho didn\u2019t have a heart, from the Lithuanian side, you know. For instance, used to\ntrade a\u2014 a-\u2014a suit for a\u2014 for a kilo of butter. So after you \u2014 you have to do that fast,\nyou know, because they \u2014 you had to do that when the guard was with his back to \u2014\nto you, you know. So, in the desperation you found out sometimes that instead of\nbutter, what you had is a big stone, on that \u2014 I mean, with \u2014 with a\u2014 with a little bit\n\u2014 with a little bit of butter on \u2014 on the sides, you know. And it was disaster, and you\n\u2014 you were unable to do anything, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 those people who were free\nhad all the rights. We were \u2014 we \u2014 we lost [indecipherable] lost, we were\ninhunamen \u2014 | mean, not \u2014 not considered human. They \u2014 although they didn\u2019t\ntattoo us with \u2014 with \u2014 on the beginning [indecipherable] afterwards in \u2014 when\nthey took to the concentration camp. So life was \u2014 was terrible, especially in the\nbeginning, it \u2014 it-it was very hard to \u2014 to get the \u2014 get used to and accommodate it,\nbut \u2014 but there was no \u2014 no choice. You had to \u2014 you had to do what you were told\nto do, you know, it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Was the move to the ghetto itself chaotic, or was it \u2014 how was it organized \u2014\n42September 22, 1994",

        "A: \u2014 very much \u2014 the move \u2014 the move to the ghetto was very organized. Was very\norganized in the sense that you would hardly see fights between people that, no I\nwant this house, I want that house. There were certain \u2014 that was certain way\norganized that you were able \u2014 of course, you had to get yourself a \u2014 somebody \u2014 a\nhorseman with a buggy and \u2014 and be able to \u2014 to carry over, and couple pieces of\nfurniture, and mostly the \u2014 the \u2014 your personal belongings. But it was in a certain\nway \u2014 it was in certain way organized, because by \u2014 by the people themselves. You\nknow, it\u2019s not \u2014 we di \u2014 we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we had a certain leadership which was\nalready instituted, but it was not a \u2014 a \u2014 a full time leadership, it was just \u2014 they\ncame with the least, and they told you look, you have to go here, here, here, and you\nhave to do this and this and it, and wa \u2014 you know, the people were very much\norganized, and very much respectful, you know, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re not \u2014 we were not\nstrict people, you know, it was mostly people who were \u2014 who had a certain\nbackground, and you hardly were able to find somebody that was not educated, that\nwas not able to read or write. This was \u2014 you take from the Lithuanians, you hadSeptember 22, 1994\nlike 50 percent for the people were illiterate, you know, especially those who lived\non the farms, they \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t know how to read or write. They used to put\na cross for \u2014 when they had to sign something, you know. And this was the sad part,\nyou know, because people who are not literate, and who drink a lot and who don\u2019t\nhave any \u2014 any \u2014 any \u2014 any feeling towards \u2014 towards [indecipherable] humans,\nthey \u2014 they become \u2014 they become very \u2014 they become like animals, you know, and\n\u2014 and this is what \u2014 what happened there, and I really regret to say that, that there\nwere, of course cases whereby they harbored Jews, they helped to escape, and\nthere\u2019s \u2014 but that was sporadic, I mean, that was like a one percent, or something,\nthat \u2014 that have \u2014 were human. And this was also most people who were a little bit\nbetter educated, and who actually knew the facts, and \u2014 and who \u2014 who were able to\n\u2014 to analyze, and \u2014 and \u2014 and realize that saving somebody in these critical times,\nalthough they expose their lives, because any \u2014 anybody that saved a Jew was like \u2014\noh, it \u2014 would be \u2014 would be shot the same way, like the \u2014 those people that they\nsaved.",
        "Q: Basically, as soon as the Germans occupied Kovno, life, as you all knew it,\nstopped. I mean, that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 nobody went to school, and \u2014September 22, 1994",
        "A: No, no. There were no schools there. But amazingly \u2014 amazingly that in the\nghetto, we were like 30 some thousand people, were pushed into this couple square\nkilometers in very inhuman conditions. But th-the \u2014 the ghetto life right away \u2014 I\nmean, we right away organized ourselves. We had like \u2014 we had a \u2014 a \u2014 a el-elder\u2019s\n[indecipherable] which was a council, with a head of the council, which was a\nprominent \u2014 a prominent doctor. For many years, a Lithuanian \u2014 he was a M.D., and\nhe \u2014 he was considered one of the top doctors in Lithuania, Dr. Elkes. And he was\nvery strict, very \u2014 in the beginning he didn\u2019t want to take the job, but the \u2014 the other\npeople from the \u2014 I mean, the head people from the ghetto came to him, and they\npleaded with him that he should \u2014 he should there \u2014 they need him, because first of\nall, his perfect German, and his perfect Lithuanian, and perfect Russian, and he was\nalready educated, very cultured person. And beside that, the respect that even those\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the captors had for \u2014 for him, in a certain way, his\nknown \u2014 his name was very, very prominent. So they felt with this respect him \u2014 the\nGermans expressed very big respect for him, although they compelled this council\nto do their dirty work in \u2014 in many cases. But many of those who belonged to the\ncouncil, and then the council instituted a ghetto police. And we had like over a\nhundred police officers. Their whole uniform was only a \u2014 a hat, and a armband\nwhat say, Jewish police. Plus the fact they had to use also the \u2014 the stars, the sameSeptember 22, 1994\nlike everybody else. But these police was very instrumental in \u2014 in many cases, 1n\nmany \u2014 after we were already established in the ghetto, we had a \u2014 most of the\npeople had already a regular \u2014 I mean, some regular job, work, you know, the job\nwas because \u2014 nobody paid for the job. They hardly gave you sufficient food to \u2014\nfor your sustenance, you know. But when \u2014 when \u2014 for instance, myself, I worked\nin the beginning in the flugplatz, that\u2019s an airport. And not only worked, I put in\nextra time, I was \u2014",
        "Q: Speaking of airports.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s especially \u2014 you know, it\u2019s strange, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 when you\ngo back to your country, you go back to the city, which looked when you were very\n\u2014 when you were small, I mean, it looked to you that it\u2019s a fantastic city, because\nyou didn\u2019t know better, you know. When you go back and you see, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nyou walk this same distance that you used to walk on the garden before, it seems to\nyou so small, and so insignificant, you know, it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s pathetic, you know? So I\nremember we used to walk on \u2014 under guard, with loaded rifles like \u2014 like\nsupercriminals and all the \u2014 although there were no cases \u2014 very few cases of\nresistance within the \u2014 within the ghetto, within the \u2014 the \u2014 the establishment. And\nyou \u2014 you call \u2014 you do your work, and you come back after a day\u2019s work, whereby\nyou have guards there, and they constantly changed. In the beginning they had the\n46September 22, 1994\nGerman guards, but then they start to bringing in the \u2014 the [indecipherable] the\nRussian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians. And believe me, these guards,\nthey were incompassionate. They used to beat you up every time you \u2014 you \u2014 you\nhad to \u2014 to work, I mean without \u2014 almost without food, but constantly, and under\nsupervision, and within the cold weather, they \u2014 they used to put a\u2014 a some a\u2014a\nside fire in our work. From time to time you would come and \u2014 and warm up your\nhands, you know, you had the mittens, or the \u2014 but that do \u2014 didn\u2019t mean anything\nnow, because if your body doesn\u2019t have fuel, I mean, you \u2014 you are \u2014 you still cold\n\u2014 it gets colder than in normal, when you have food. And they used to have special\n\u2014 special woods \u2014 wood sticks, which they would beat you up, you know, ev-every\ntime, and without \u2014 without mercy. And every time you used to go to warm up, you\nstayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was\nprohibited to do that in the beginning, but you would do it \u2014 come out, because\nwhen the \u2014 and so my uncle was \u2014 he was a sick man, you know, he \u2014 so I used to\nwork for him, I \u2014 sh \u2014 because there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day,\naround the clock, to work at the airport, because they want to re-re-reestablish the\nairport, and \u2014 in order to be able to use that for their \u2014 for their own \u2014 for their own\nuse, for their \u2014 and life was \u2014 was terrible. Of course, it \u2014 it gradually was in \u2014 in\nchanging. In the beginning it was a ghetto. Then after \u2014 after a while it became aSeptember 22, 1994\nconcentration camp, and we have received the \u2014 before we were under the\nWehrmacht, under the military. Then we \u2014 we came under the jurisdiction of the\nObersturmfiihrer Gecker(ph), and that was the SS. It\u2019s funny now this calls the \u2014\nthe [indecipherable]. So the SS, they were \u2014 they were terrible. They \u2014 they were\nstill much worse than the Wehrmacht, because the Wehrmacht you found\nsometimes between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you\nknow, they\u2019re \u2014 they were \u2014 they were called to \u2014 to duty. But there were still\ncertain aspects of \u2014 of humanity, at one point, you know. But this \u2014 this\n[indecipherable] came in, and then they declared that as a concentration camp. So\nwe came \u2014 we became a\u2014 a-\u2014a-\u2014ina different status, whereby this was right after \u2014\nafter the big aktia(ph), which was October 20\" \u2014 28\", 1941, is when they \u2014 when\nthey came in with loudspeakers and they announced that next morning, five o\u2019clock\nin the morning, after we have in a \u2014 in a special \u2014 a special large place, that\neverybody has to be out. Nobody can stay in the house. Not even the sick people\ncan stay in the house. Everybody has to be out. If they find somebody inside, they\nwill shoot him. So, next morning, everybody came out, and the \u2014 took some food,\nand they \u2014 they said that you take \u2014 if you had some food, take with you, because\nyou\u2019re not going to be provided with any \u2014 any food. So everybody came out, and\nsuddenly a few German trucks came in, and it was \u2014 with guards, and they \u2014 theySeptember 22, 1994\nsurrounded the place, and then the \u2014 the head of the Gestapo that time was a guy by\nthe name of Rauca. Joseph, I think was his name, Rauca, and was a big German, a\nheavyset guy, and they came with dogs, and they started \u2014 they started \u2014 first of all,\nthey searched houses, spot searched, whatever they can find somebody. And they\nas-assured themselves nobody there. They start pulling people to the left and to the\nright. Well, right away we saw that the people that they pulled to the left are mostly\nchildren, elderly people, people who are \u2014 have some blemish, or have some \u2014 some\n\u2014 some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know. And I remember I had a\nlittle coat, you know, was a \u2014 was a fur \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the collar. So \u2014 and it was\na cold \u2014 a cold [indecipherable] was October, it was already winter, basically in the\n\u2014 almost snow was \u2014 we were going to see. There were signs that snow was going\nto fall there. So then, I had my \u2014 my grandmother was with me, and I knew that\nthey are going to call her. So, it was like instinctively, you know, when they pull her\naway. And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to\nsave her, you know, right, yeah, she was still with us for a couple more years\nafterward. But then they \u2014 they took out all those people, and they took them away.\nAnd that was a whole day operation, and we came home. Of course, we understood\nthat they are taking them to a certain special assignment. I would like also to\nmention that the \u2014 the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right \u2014 rightSeptember 22, 1994\nafter the ghetto was closed, we found out in the next few days, that those was the\nfirst 500 people that they took to the\n, and they shot them all. Because their aim and their interest was to \u2014 to get rid of\nthe \u2014 of \u2014 of more intelligent people, or people who are \u2014 who can plan, and who\nwere \u2014 who had certain \u2014 certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to \u2014 to\nget rid of them right away. And \u2014 and then there \u2014 there were \u2014 they were ina\ncertain way right, and they were, in a certain way they have accomplished their \u2014\ntheir \u2014 their doing. Now this time \u2014 that was 500. Now this time, on October 28\",\nthey took them also to the Ninth Fort, and they also shot them, and there were\n10,000 of them. They \u2014 they had \u2014 they were more ready for these 10,000 than for\nthe 500, because they already had excavated. They had \u2014 they had a brigade that\nthey took ahead of time, and they didn\u2019t know what \u2014 that was a \u2014 a small aktion,\nwhich they took about a few dozen people. And their \u2014 their job was to excavate in\nthe vicinity of the Ninth Fort. And fort was large, you know, those forts were\nestablished by the Russians, and they were specially kept for \u2014 for protection of the\ncity. You see, Kovno was surrounded by the Third Fort, the Seventh Fort, the\nNinth Fort. There were like four forts. And they were done by the \u2014 still by the \u2014\nby the Russians. They were at high \u2014 at high levels, and \u2014 and they were \u2014 had a \u2014\nplaces for \u2014 for \u2014 for soldiers, and \u2014 and \u2014 and of course they had places forSeptember 22, 1994\ninmates. So they \u2014 those were the 10,000 that were \u2014 they \u2014 they liquida \u2014 so they\nactually cut by one-third, right away, the ghetto. This was also in conjunction with\nthe burning, and with the \u2014 of the small ghetto. You see, when the ghetto was\ninstituted, they had the large ghetto, and they had the small ghetto. What was the\ndifference? The difference was that one main thoroughfare, one main road, run\nthrough the \u2014 through the ghetto, between the small and the large. And what they\ndid is \u2014 what they \u2014 what they did is they instituted a \u2014 they built a bridge from the\nlarge ghetto to the small ghetto, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was\nalways under military supervision. So the \u2014 the beginning, and this \u2014 in the small\nghetto they had a hospital. There was a hospital that they converted, they have\narranged for that, and they had a hospital with very, very \u2014 we had quite a number\nof doctors, and had quite a number of \u2014 of \u2014 of patients, people who were ill, who\nwere sick, who were \u2014 who were old, who needed \u2014 who needed care, and there\nwere also some women who were pregnant, you know. So this hospital was full to\ncapacity. And one day what they decided is that \u2014 that they felt that \u2014 apparently\nthat they don\u2019t need a hospital, and they don\u2019t need no sick people. So what they did\nis they surrounded the hospital, they surrounded that with haystack around. They\npoured gas. They nailed the doors in the hospital, and they burned \u2014 everybody was\nburned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, including the \u2014 includingSeptember 22, 1994\nthe \u2014 including the pregnant women, including the \u2014 there was such a terrible \u2014 I\nmean, the \u2014 the \u2014 you \u2014 you could smell the \u2014 the \u2014 the stench, you know, the \u2014 the\npeople. And right after that they had the \u2014 the big aktia(ph), and then they \u2014 they\neliminated completely \u2014 this small ghetto was completely, those few people who\nstill were there were evacuated, were passed to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the bigger ghetto,\nbecause it became more room available by \u2014 by eliminating 10,000 people, it was\ntoo much room, you know, basically, based \u2014 based on they \u2014 on their standard. But\nthis was a terrible, terrible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the \u2014 this \u2014 this was\n\u2014 in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know,\nthat\u2019s \u2014 which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain \u2014 for \u2014 like for\nchildren, for \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 for babies, and then old people and so on.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]\nEnd of Tape Three\n52September 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: I have to mention that also, that \u2014 can I go on? Also being in the ghetto was very\ntraumatic, but the chairmans from time to time, they called up Dr. Elkes and they\nsaid, we need hundred people for a special assignment. Nobody knew whether this\nassignment is for real or whether it is to take out and to shoot people, but there were\nsome real assignments. So I remember the Arbeitsamt, which was the place where\nthe \u2014 where the council was, and it was a special building assigned \u2014 it was also a\nplace that had also a jail. Because within the ghetto, there were sometimes found\nsome people who are \u2014 who stole and who did certain acts of \u2014 which was not\npermitted, you know. So I remember that when the police head in \u2014 in the\nArbeitsamt, the \u2014 the council, they had a \u2014 a very difficult task, whom to take out?\nI mean, the chairmans told them we need hundred people. I mean, there were also\ncertain favoritism, which has to \u2014 I mean, happens from time to time, you know,\nbecause if you have a \u2014 if you are a police officer and you have a relat \u2014 a relative\nthat they want him out, I mean, you would \u2014 you would try to protect him rather\nthan somebody you don\u2019t know. So in many cases, it was a very, very difficult job\nfor the \u2014 for the \u2014 for the elderat(ph), for the \u2014 for the council to take. What they\nopted to do is, most of the time, is people who didn\u2019t have families, people who \u2014\nwho didn\u2019t have \u2014 who were not rooted for, for some reason, whom they had someSeptember 22, 1994\ngrievances or some problems with them, problematic, you know. Because many\npeople have just collapsed mentally under this pressure, you know, not everybody\nwas able to be withstand that, you know, because it was \u2014 it was like the game of\nthe cat and \u2014 and the mouse, you know, and it bites off one leg and then the other\none. I mean, it was a constant game, you know, and especially when \u2014 when the \u2014\nwhen the Gestapo used to appear and come into \u2014 to the ghetto. I mean, it was very\ntraumatic. I have also to mention to you is about were \u2014 because it came to my mind\nabout Rauca. I had a personal \u2014 after I finished at the airport, I got myself a good\nbrigade. Mine was good because I worked in a \u2014 for some reason they \u2014 they\nformed a new one and I was at the right time at the right place. They formed a\nbrigade in a marmalade factory \u2014 and this was fantastic, you know \u2014 which had\nlike \u2014 our brigadier was a guy by the name of Motts(ph), who survived incidentally\nthe ghetto [indecipherable] later in Italy. And I was very friendly with \u2014 with him\nand I was able to stick to this brigade after \u2014 especially after the flugplatz, this was\nlike a\u2014a new life. Brigade was \u2014 we had to \u2014 that was a \u2014 a factory of marmalade\nand right next to that was also a place where they used to produce sauerkraut and\nsour pickles \u2014 pickled \u2014 pickled, you know, cucumbers. And at least you had \u2014 you\nwere able to \u2014 to \u2014 to get some food, you know, because sauerkraut and pickles and\nmarmalade, it's already a meal. And plus the fact marmalade is made with sugar andSeptember 22, 1994\nsugar 1s very heavy. I remember they \u2014 they used to \u2014 I was compelled \u2014 I was\npretty strong, you know, and I was compelled to \u2014 to take up bags of hundred kilo\nsugar \u2014 which is 225 pounds \u2014 to the third floor, where the \u2014 where they had the\nmixing of the \u2014 of the marmalade. And sometimes what I used to do is, I used to\npunch a hole in the bag and I had a \u2014 this \u2014 this coat that you see on this \u2014 on this\npicture, on this one. My grandmother had made, like a \u2014 a double \u2014 a double-deck,\nyou know \u2014 a double \u2014 I mean, of the \u2014 the lower part. And \u2014",
        "Q: Let \u2014 let \u2014 I'm sorry. Can we start that thought again and just say, I had a coat\nthat my grandmother \u2014",
        "A: Okay, I had a coat that my grandmother fixed it up in such a fashion that she\nmade like a \u2014 hidden pockets. And when I carried the sugar, I used to punch a hole\nin the \u2014 in the bag and the su \u2014 then \u2014 and make from \u2014 from paper, make like a\nlittle canal, and I used to canal the \u2014 canal the sugar from \u2014 from the bag, directly to\nmy \u2014 to my coat, you know. And this \u2014 this was very, very helpful in a certain way\nto survive because sugar 1s \u2014 1s very nutritious. And \u2014 and in one case, there were \u2014\nwe had a \u2014 a \u2014 a German civilian who was very much connected to the Gestapo.\nOne \u2014 and beside that, what I used to do also, I used to steal marmalade. But the\nonly way to steal that was in \u2014 in \u2014 we had like \u2014 like they have now \u2014 you know,\nthe metal Coca-Cola containers \u2014 using a container. And \u2014 and many times ISeptember 22, 1994\nburned my \u2014 my st \u2014 my \u2014 my stomach because I used to steal that and I used to\ninsert it right here, and then with a coat, I used to close it up. And \u2014 and I used to\npull it out from the ber \u2014 from the na \u2014 I \u2014 I was not able to have accessibility to this\nwhen it was already placed in a cool place, so I had to take that when it was hot.\nAnd this was \u2014 it was sometimes terrible. But notwithstanding that, I felt that the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the pain of the \u2014 of the burning was worth it in order to \u2014 to accomplish the \u2014\nthe \u2014 to accomplish the aim \u2014 you know, the goal.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a question. Rae(ph) had \u2014 when Rae(ph) talked to you the\nother day, she mentioned that you said something about carrying sugar up to the\nGestapo.",
        "A: Yeah, that was in \u2014 in my \u20141n my school, where I went, to the gymnasium. I\nhad \u2014 I was sent \u2014 twice, I was sent there for special work, also carrying 225 pounds\nof on to \u2014 also to the top floor. They converted our school to a \u2014 they made it to a \u2014\nto a storage place. And \u2014 and we had to \u2014 we had to do that, and that was \u2014 that was\nbefore that.",
        "Q: Okay. Would you tell me \u2014 you tell me about that though?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. About \u2014",
        "Q: What did you do, because I'm \u2014",
        "A: I \u2014 what I did is, we had to carry these bags of \u2014 they used to take us with the\n56September 22, 1994\ntruck, come to the main entrance, and we used to have to \u2014 to \u2014 about five or six of\nus, go up to the top floor where they had the \u2014 the sugar, and they had the \u2014 had the\npurpose to place that in a high level, that it should not be stolen or something. So\nthey \u2014 we \u2014 we used to carry \u2014 carry them to \u2014 to the cert \u2014 to certain places for \u2014\nfor \u2014 for stirring purposes. And \u2014 but that was not related to the marmalade factory,\nwhich it was a separate \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. But while we're on that, who was up there?",
        "A: There was a \u2014 there was a military storage for the \u2014 for the German \u2014 for the\nGerman army. And it was not precisely Gestapo, it was a military. Gestapo is \u2014 I\nwas \u2014 I was threatened by this Meyer(ph), when I was in the factory. One day he\ncaught me with \u2014 with this \u2014 with this marmalade, and he just waved his finger and\nsays, next time, you're going to go to the Gestapo if I catch you. It was \u2014 it was\nsomething like that. So he was very generous at that time, you know. He just kicked\nme and that\u2019s all, and took away the \u2014",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when you went up to take the sugar to the stor \u2014 this military\nstorage place, did you hear people talking, did you see anything that was\nparticularly interesting?",
        "A: Not \u2014 we were too busy in \u2014 1n \u2014 1n carrying again, and be able to carry the load.\nThat was \u2014 that was \u2014 actually, my mi \u2014 our mind was blanked out at that time. WeSeptember 22, 1994\n\u2014 we were not able even to communicate because they \u2014 they used to \u2014 when \u2014\nwhen it came to a \u2014 to a job like this, it's not like the airport where you had a shovel\nand a\u2014 and a pick and you have to dig and this. You know, this \u2014 this was \u2014 they\nhad to be unloaded in a \u2014 1n a certain time and they \u2014 and you had to \u2014 you had to\nrush. And if you wouldn\u2019t rush, they \u2014 they just clubbed you. So at this \u2014 this\nmoment, you were \u2014 you were just trying to \u2014 to keep up with your strength, in\norder to be able to fulfill the \u2014 ful-fulfill the \u2014 the job. There was also, in \u2014 in cases\nbefore I \u2014 I became \u2014 I start working \u2014 notwithstanding if we worked at this\n[indecipherable] brigade, from time to time, they take \u2014 took us to some other\nplaces. And I have to tell you something which is \u2014 which was very much inscribed\nin my \u2014 in my memory, 1s that [indecipherable] in the \u2014 in 1941, beginning '42,\nthey brought to Lithuania, echelons \u2014 train loads with the boxcars, you know, of\npeople from Austria and from Czechoslovakia and from some other places. And\namazingly \u2014",
        "Q: I've got to stop you. I hate doing [break]",
        "A: So that \u2014",
        "Q: Actually, I need that you to start that whole \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. There\u2019s a very remarkable something that I have to bring it up because\nthere are certain aspects of me being in the \u2014 in the camps that \u2014 that I have toSeptember 22, 1994\nhighlight. And one of them is that this incredible experience that I had. And namely,\nthey start bringing, to the railroad station, echelons \u2014 boxcars with the Jews from\nAustria and Germany. They called that, we found out later, the Hebrew siedlung.\nHebrew siedlung basically means, place from one \u2014 take them from one place and\nput them to other place, in German. And these train came with cars loaded with\npianos, with furniture, with all kinds of luxury items, to make believe to those\npeople, when they \u2014 because you see, when they took out from Germany or from\nAustria, Jews to send them to \u2014 to their \u2014 to their massacre, to their \u2014 I mean, to\ntheir \u2014 to their graves, to their killings, was \u2014 apparently, they had a certain \u2014 a\ncertain \u2014 had to handle it in a certain way. They tried to convince them that they are\nbeing taken to other place, just only to \u2014 they have to take them to \u2014 to \u2014 to other\nplaces. So when they came \u2014 and at that time, I was working for the Gestapo\nbrigade. There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many\npeople have tried very hard to work in this brigade, because this brigade was always\nconnected with certain \u2014 certain things that had to do with food. And there was\nmany possibilities to \u2014 to fill up your stomach, you know, to be \u2014 to \u2014 not to be\nhungry. And this time they needed additional \u2014 additional people. So apparently,\nthey took me and they took a \u2014 a group of other people to that task. And I \u2014 and I\nsaw the way this echelons came, and I saw that they came in \u2014 in like, in plush\nSeptember 22, 1994\ntrains. It was not the \u2014 the \u2014 some \u2014 some boxcars came also at the same time, but\nthey came for a \u2014 for \u2014 for a purpose of \u2014 of baggage and \u2014 and some other things.\nBut these trains came with \u2014 and the people with their jewelry, with everything, and\n\u2014and you could see very high standard people who came. And I knew exactly what\nthey are doing with \u2014 what they are going to do with them. Before \u2014 this Rauca\ncame over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were like, six trucks, six guys, and\nhe said to us \u2014 he said, you see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these\npeople. There is no way that you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing. If I\nsee your lips moving, I know that you are trying to tell them something or give \u2014\nsend them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your\nhead. And he just like, took his pistol and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and just scraped our \u2014 our \u2014\nour faces, you know, with that, to \u2014 to \u2014 to impress upon us that he means business,\nyou know. The difficulty was by knowing what \u2014 what\u2019s going to happen to those\npeople. How do we tell them \u2014 or whether \u2014 whether to tell them was the right\nthing, or not to tell them. It was so difficult. Now, our task was to take out from the\nwindows, a German with \u2014 with loudspeaker would say to the \u2014 say to one of the\ncars \u2014 plush cars and say [speaks German]. It means, give me your packs. You\nhave a few kilometers. You have to go a few kilometers, please give out your\npackages because it\u2019s going to be very burdensome and we are going \u2014 pla-placingSeptember 22, 1994\nthese packages in the trucks and we are going to deliver them. And make sure to\ninscribe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return that to\nyou. I knew that that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s fallacy. I mean, this 1s \u2014 where they are taking them\nis to the Ninth Fort and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s about 10 or 12 miles walking. It\u2019s not a couple of\nkilometers. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to them. And in one case, I saw a\nlady, which I \u2014 pretty young lady, and \u2014 and I really felt \u2014 with her husband, felt \u2014 a\ncouple apparently \u2014 and I felt very bad and I \u2014 I tried to \u2014 to explain to them, to tell\nthem that \u2014 of course, we were already involved in taking the packages, and \u2014 and I\n\u2014I-\u2014TI looked around, I didn\u2019t see Rauca there, apparently he went to have\nsomething to drink or something. And \u2014 and I said to them that, they are taking you\nto your death. Try \u2014 when \u2014 when you \u2014 when \u2014 when you will march, try to \u2014 to\nescape or try to \u2014 to do something or something. You know, the people didn\u2019t\nbelieve me. They just didn\u2019t trust me. They trusted the Germans by that time, but\nthey didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t trust me. They looked at me and looked at me, and they\nlooked at me like I am \u2014 like I am trying to \u2014 and then I \u2014 I \u2014I felt very bad about\nthe fact \u2014 I mean, I\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I felt scared that they should not \u2014 they should not give\nme \u2014 turn me over, or say that I tried to \u2014 to tell them. This \u2014 this was the \u2014 this was\nthe fanatism. Th-The German \u2014 the German Jews were very big fanatic. They felt\nthat they were first Germans and then Jews. That was their big \u2014 their big problem.September 22, 1994\nThey were \u2014 they \u2014 they eliminated from their prayer books, Jerusalem \u2014 it would\nsay, next year in Jerusalem. They used to put in, next year in Berlin. Th-Th-This \u2014\nthis incident I remember so vividly. And I remember when we took the packages,\nand we took them directly to the Gestapo. And the Gestapo, they had a big \u2014 a big\nwarehouse where they just threw them in one big pile and then they used to have a \u2014\nthose people who worked at the Gestapo used to sort them out and place \u2014 for\ninstance, place different items in \u2014 based on a list that they had, which items have to\ngo here and there. You know, they were very meticulous and very organized. The\nGermans, they were extremely organized. I mean, when it came to organization it\nwas \u2014 I mean, they were leaders 1n the world on that, you know.",

        "A: And then, of course, we found out 1941, that in the small cities they took out\neverybody. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t put them in the camps or ghetto or anything, but\nthey took them out and \u2014 and in \u2014 in \u2014 in certain secluded spaces and they made\nthem dig graves and then they \u2014 they shot them there. And there was mostly\nLithuanians have done this, under supervision of the \u2014 of the Germans. I \u2014 I have a\nbook here which is \u2014 describes city by city when it happened and how it happened.September 22, 1994\nAnd it happened to be that my father was one of the eld-eldest in the \u2014 in RokiSkis,\nand \u2014 him and the other one. And he was offered to \u2014 to \u2014 they offered him that he\nwas to \u2014 to give him some harbor \u2014 shelter, you know, harbor him, and at \u2014 himself,\nbut he said, it has to be the whole family. They said, the family we cannot do, you\nyourself. He said no way. Wherever the family goes, I\u2014 I go. And of course,\nafterwards, last \u2014 two years ago I was in Lithuania, and I went to the place that \u2014\nvery secluded small place, a few kilometers from the city where they took there \u2014\nthere were like 2,750 people, children, elderly, and \u2014 which they \u2014 they have\nmassacred \u2014 massacred them there. They kept them for a short time. We had a \u2014 in\nour city we had a little lake, and there was \u2014 there was a count that had his palace\nthere, still from the times \u2014 times [indecipherable]. So in this \u2014 this place, they \u2014\nthey made \u2014 and then he had some stables for horses. So right there they made\ncertain accommodations and they kept there, the people, you know, for \u2014 for a few\ndays and then they took them out to this, three kilometers from the city, the name\nwas Boryar(ph). And you had to go through a narrow path, you know, and there\nwas, like a wooded area and they took them there and there \u2014 there is a \u2014 they have\na monument there, on the \u2014 and they \u2014 they shot them \u2014 all of them there.",
        "Q: Did you have much information in terms of what was happening in other towns\nwhen you were \u2014\n64September 22, 1994",
        "A: Very \u2014 very \u2014 very \u2014 very little information. You know, they \u2014 we were kept\naway from newspapers, from \u2014 but, of course, when we went to \u2014 to \u2014 outside to\nwork in the brigades, we had sometimes opportunities to \u2014 to exchange views with\nsome Lithuanians. We had also a case where I had my cousin Erie(ph) Adoen(ph),\nwhere we worked together. One \u2014 one day they took us to en-ess-ka-ka(ph), that\nwas a\u2014 NSKK, it\u2019s called en-ess-ka-ka(ph) in German \u2014 which they \u2014 they \u2014 that\nwas a\u2014a Special unit, that they took us to \u2014 to cut s \u2014 it was winter. It was snowing.\nIt was \u2014 it was Christmas \u2014 before Christmas eve. And they took us to a place and\nwe had to cut some wood. And it was cold and the \u2014 the guard \u2014 lady \u2014 it was a\nLithuanian lady, she felt pity on us, you know. She owned \u2014 she was a \u2014 a opera\nsinger. And she invited us to come in to warm up and then she gave us a little soup\nand some other things. And then she \u2014 we were reminded, my cousin. She kind of\nblessed us and told us that she hopes that we are going to live through this dark\nchapter and \u2014 and survive. But \u2014 and \u2014 and the guard that was with us was \u2014 also\nwas a -\u2014 this was too, before it became a \u2014 a concentration camp. He was also from\nthe Wehrmacht, and was a very \u2014 very nice guy and was also shivering, you know.\nAt least we were cutting wood and we had \u2014 the blood was flowing through our\nveins and we were a little warm but he had \u2014 he all the time he just patted himself\nnot to \u2014 that was a \u2014 a very \u2014 there are some moments, you know, that you \u2014 youSeptember 22, 1994\nremember, you know, vi-vividly. I remember exactly the house where \u2014 in my back\nmind \u2014 the way where we were, cutting the wood and the way she invited us to the\nhouse and that she \u2014 she had even tears in her eyes, and she said that \u2014 she was very\nhuman, you know, was very much against what \u2014 what \u2014 what was going on and\nhappening. She talked to us in Lithuanian, the guard didn\u2019t understand anyway, so \u2014\nso she was very open. And right away she gave us tea and some \u2014 some soup and\nsome piece of bread. Incidentally, Lithuanian food was very good bread, the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe butter, and all this. We \u2014 Lithuania used to export to England, all kinds of farm\nproducts to \u2014 to England in large numbers. Now, of course, when the Russians\ncame, I mean they \u2014 they took out everything. I mean, they devastated the country.\nThey eliminate many, many \u2014 we have cows in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the thousands, you\nknow, the \u2014",

        "Q: Did everybody in the ghetto go out on these work brigades?\nSeptember 22, 1994",
        "A: There were some \u2014 some factories within the ghetto. They were mostly for\nyoungsters and for people who learned a trade. I had, for instance, a teacher of\nmathematics by the name of Faulkman(ph). He was a brilliant, brilliant guy. He\nbecame a shoemaker in the ghetto. And you know, if you had a trade you had more\n\u2014 more possibilities to \u2014 to survive and to \u2014 you know, especially, you know, there\nwere many Germans that used to come in and say, look, my boots are \u2014 fix them \u2014\nand this and that, and \u2014 or my \u2014 need some buttons here, and I need certain things to\n\u2014 to be fixed. And tradespeople were able to \u2014 to fulfill their requirement. Now,\nthere were \u2014 basically the \u2014 the ghetto were stattin(ph), that\u2019s the way they were\ncalled. The ghetto factories were \u2014 basically what they did is they used to \u2014 to\nmanufacture there many items for the army, like, all kind of uniforms \u2014 everything\nfrom uniforms, from hats, from underwear, from \u2014 from boots. And \u2014 and we had\nshoemakers and we had tailors and we had \u2014 we had all kind of tradespeople who\nwere there. We had also something very interesting, which is going to surprise you,\nthat I\u2019m going to tell you. We had a symphony orchestra within the ghetto. We had\npeople who were very talented, extremely talented. They \u2014 they were performing\nsometimes with the permission of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the guards and so forth. We had\nto announce that \u2014 that we\u2019re going to have a concert \u2014 a concert there. There were\npeople \u2014 writers who wrote and who \u2014 and of course, doctors. I could mention to\n67September 22, 1994\nyou now, we didn\u2019t have a hospital, so we made a provisional place where we used\nto take care of sick people, and \u2014 but the word was, don\u2019t get sick if you want to\nsurvive. And that was, don\u2019t get sick if you want to survive. So how can you\nprevent that? Sometimes, you know, with the snow and the bad weather and the\ncolds. But the \u2014 the instinct, you know, the force of wanting to survive was\nsometimes so \u2014 so strong, you know, that is stronger than \u2014 than \u2014 than \u2014 than any\nbacteria or anything. You know, they over \u2014 you can overcome something. And this\nis without food. And I myself, when I used to work in sadiva(ph) \u2014",
        "Q: I think we have to change the tapes.\nEnd of Tape FourSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Were the workshops or factories used as a way to essentially hide people?",
        "A: They used to \u2014 we had also, sometimes a influx from people who were\nwandering around, and they didn\u2019t find themselves on the outside. They were being\nharbored by some Lithuanians, but up to a point, they start in jeopardizing their\nlives with the Lithuanians. So in many cases, some of the people came back to the\nghetto. And they \u2014 how did they come back? They infiltrated through the brigades\nthat used to come, they used to sneak in some way, and they used to come in. Now,\nsome of those people, you had to establish them, you had to give them ma \u2014 because\nwe had identification cards. Everyone in the ghetto has a identification. We had to\nfalsify a card, put them in, and some of those people also became employed in the\nghetto estattin(ph) \u2014 in \u2014 in the ghetto factories. They were \u2014 some of them, they\nwere also harboring, in certain cases, sometimes preparing some weaponry, making\n\u2014 making bullets, and other \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 \u201941, we had already a\u2014a guy by the\nname of Jaime(ph) Jellin(ph). Jellin(ph) was a very educated, very intelligent\nyoung man whose family was known for many years. They had a \u2014 they had\nbookstores. And they had \u2014 they were \u2014 they were very, very known in the \u2014 in the\ncommunity as \u2014 as very educated, and \u2014 and very intelligent people. So this\nJellin(ph), who was a really brain, he start forming quietly \u2014 he was in contact with\n69September 22, 1994\na \u2014 you know, when people used to go out to work in the brigades, there were\ncertain contacts, from time to time, with some Lithuanians, and some Jewish people\nwho lived their life like Lithuanians. And through them, through contacts \u2014 which\nin many cases they failed, because you never knew who 1s going to betray you. You\nhad sometimes to have confidence. But there were passwords, and there were some\ncertain ways of \u2014 of protecting yourself, and so they started this movement of\ngetting people out, and \u2014 and getting in \u2014 getting to the woods. There was the \u2014 the\nunderstanding was that the Germans were very much afraid of the woods, because\nthere were \u2014 there was already started a resistance. But you see, there were a douple\n\u2014a double \u2014 a double problem in this respect, because to get out from the ghetto,\nand to reach the woods, you had to cross, and you had to \u2014 to cr \u2014 g-get involved\nwith some \u2014 with some Lithuanians, in \u2014 in many cases, and you really didn\u2019t know\n\u2014 you see, they were not the Germans. The \u2014 the biggest problem were the\nLithuanians, because they know \u2014 they knew the Germans wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t\ndifferentiate a Jew from a Lithuanian, but the Lithuanians did \u2014 did \u2014 did \u2014 did\nknow that. From my \u2014 for instance myself, I \u2014 I had few friends who were by\nthemselves, and they \u2014 they decided they\u2019re going to join the \u2014 the partisans. There\nwas a very good friend of mine, he was the son of the rabbi from Sakiai. Sakiai\nwas a small city in Lithuania. [indecipherable] Golden. There was a other friend,September 22, 1994\nwho now lives in \u2014 [indecipherable] Golden. He has a \u2014 was a terrible \u2014 a terrible\n\u2014a terrible end to this young, brilliant, bright man. He joined the partisans, and in a\nskirmish \u2014 they were some way betrayed in a skirmish. They had a \u2014 they \u2014 they\nhad a fight between them and the \u2014 and \u2014 and the Germans, he was wounded. And\nthey had to amputate his leg. And something happens th \u2014 happened that this is\nvery, very, very \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s sometimes very hard to describe that. Til this day, I\ndon\u2019t know who this was, because they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t say. They were a\nfew of his colleagues. They had to pull a straw who should kill him, because they\nhad to move out from this place and they didn\u2019t want to leave him suffering. So one\n\u2014 one \u2014 one of them pulled the straw and \u2014 and had to pull \u2014 put a bullet in his head,\nbecause they just couldn\u2019t cope with somebody that was wounded, was ha \u2014 that his\nleg had to be amputated, you know. He had gangrene. And this was a \u2014 was a prince\n\u2014 prince of a guy, you know, I remember \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 was very sad, and\n\u2014 but they have a \u2014 I had a number of \u2014 of friends who \u2014 whom I knew exactly\nwhere they are going, and we used to supply them with, from time to time with \u2014\nwith products. And I will explain to you, and that\u2019s the reason why I wanted to tell\nyou the story, what \u2014 what it came \u2014 what \u2014 what I learned to do. I used to \u2014 in\nmany cases, I used to take out the \u2014 my \u2014 take off my stars. I used to go out and \u2014\nand exchange \u2014 I used to have like shirts, or something else, you know, if I didn\u2019tSeptember 22, 1994\nhave, I used to take from somebody else, became some \u2014 something like a \u2014 like a\nbusiness. And then one day, we had our [indecipherable] the factory of the\nmarmalade on one side of the street. On the other side of the street was a company\nby the name of Pieno(ph) Sendris(ph). That was a milk products, I would call it a\nfactory, processing place, where they used to make yogurt, and \u2014 and buttermilk,\nand everything made from milk products. One say, while working in sadiva(ph), at\nbreak time, when we had lunch, I came down to the basement, and then I saw in the\nbasement a \u2014 like a sewer pipe. A large pipe, was maybe 20 some inches of\ndiameter. And then I start putting two and two together. I saw that pipe with\ndirection was toward the street, and I told my f \u2014 one of my friends that I had there\n\u2014 and he happened to be his \u2014 his life as friends. We became sick later, and I \u2014 he\nused to work, and he used to help and was [indecipherable] told him, Louis\nProwther(ph) is his name, he is now an engineer, he lives in Israel. I said, Louis,\nwatch out for me. Let me see what\u2019s on the other end of the pipe. And I climbed in\nand I climbed through the pipe. And when I came out, I came out to the \u2014 to the\nheating place, you know, to the \u2014 you know, where they have the \u2014 the heating\nplace for the \u2014 for the \u2014 for \u2014 for the building of the \u2014 the processing building of \u2014\nyou know, where they had the \u2014 the \u2014 what is that called? A \u2014 they \u2014 they had boiler\nrooms. And \u2014 and the guy, I saw a guy, a Lithuanian guy that was there, he just gotSeptember 22, 1994\n\u2014 got \u2014 got \u2014 got scared when he saw, because for the pipe was there, then I came\nout like from a chimney, you know. I s \u2014 I am sure that he felt that the devil coming\nout there. But then I identified myself, I say I am from \u2014 from the other side, from\nthe sadiva(ph), and I would like to find out what is \u2014 about their products what they\nhave, whether there is a possibility that we can bring in some products of \u2014 milk\nproducts in the ghetto. To make the story short, from that day, I became very\nfriendly with this guy, and I used to bring different items, exchange with him, and I\nused to carry back to the ghetto, all kinds of milk products. And they gave me a\nnickname, they called me Tevye the Milchhiker, you know, from shalo \u2014 from \u2014\nfrom Sholem Aleichem, you know, that, from the \u2014 the famous play, you know,\nTevye the Milkman? That was my na \u2014 I lost my name, I sa \u2014 and from that time I\nused to bring in a lot of \u2014 a lot of products, of milk products.",
        "Q: What did you give them?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What did you give them?",
        "A: All kind of \u2014 all kind of cloth, you know. Shoes or whatev \u2014 whatever, shirts or\nsomething. If I didn\u2019t have myself, I used to trade with somebody. And I was now\nin \u2014 recently to Israel, and Prowther(ph) remembers that, he says \u2014 he remembers\nmy nickname, you know. Prowther(ph), yeah. So this became a \u2014 a \u2014 a new trend,September 22, 1994\nand truthfully, there were many people that were being \u2014 were helped by that, you\nknow, because it was a \u2014 a some \u2014 a product which was \u2014 and this guy used to have\nthat as \u2014 as mu \u2014 as much \u2014 as much as I was able to carry through, you know. In\ncase that they would catch me, and it would spill it out, or they would hit me, or like\nin \u2014 1n this picture, I remember that I \u2014 I had some potatoes that I brought in, and\nthey searched us. But sometimes for five, there were Lithuanian guards. A guy, one\nguy, name was Ratneris(ph), I remember his name. And we \u2014 we knew already, he\nused to take five dollars to come in, when somebody came with certain \u2014 certain\nthings, and he would \u2014 he would look the other way around him, and let you\nthrough, you know. So there were some tolerance, you know, some \u2014 some people.\nLorus(ph) wouldn\u2019t \u2014 would do it \u2014 just search you, and find and \u2014 and beat you up,\nyou know. But that was a \u2014 a incident which \u2014 which happened to me, and \u2014",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t carrying that stuff through the pipe?",
        "A: Yeah, right. I used to attach that to my leg with a \u2014 with a piece of \u2014 of cord, and\n\u2014 and slide through, pull it \u2014 pull it in, you know. We made him \u2014 he made for us a\n\u2014a special attachment which shouldn\u2019t be spilled out or anything, you know, that \u2014\nspecial bottles, you know. There were that time, there were now \u2014 no paper cartons,\nso everything was in bottles. The refreshments were in bottles, large bottles like\nthis.September 22, 1994",
        "Q: Can you \u2014 can you just say the word pipe? Can you say I \u2014 I had to carry this out\nthrough \u2014 back through the pipe?",
        "A: Of course. The \u2014 the only way to \u2014 to communicate, was through this pipe,\nwhich \u2014 whereby through this pipe, I was able to carry through different \u2014 different\nitems, you know, of different products, and especially milk products. And this gave\nme certain fame in th \u2014 in the camp, this \u2014 well, the fame \u2014 nobody looked for fame\nbecause when the word spread too fast, that can be also counterproductive, because\nthey would start watching you, and \u2014 and finding out, and this \u2014 this could mean a\nvery bad end.",
        "Q: How would you describe what the ghetto looked like?",
        "A: The ghetto looked like a \u2014 like a little jail, comprised of individual houses and\nbuildings. It looked like a\u2014 a prison, surrounded with barbed wire [indecipherable]\nguards with high lights. It looked like a place of \u2014 a place of no return, I would put\nit this way, because nobody of those beginning 33,000 people \u2014 although everybody\ndreamed \u2014 was getting liberated. But in \u2014 in his deep mind, he knew that this is a \u2014\nthi-this is a\u2014 a\u2014a dream that\u2019s never going to be fulfilled. It \u2014 1t was as \u2014 as time\nwent by, we \u2014 we found ourselves more secluded, more guarded, more \u2014 we \u2014 we\nfound also when \u2014 when the front starts turning \u2014 turned around, and then like\nStalingrad, we f\u2014 we felt that there is a certain additional pressure on us, because\n75September 22, 1994\nthe Germans, they felt already that they are not \u2014 they didn\u2019t accomplish what they\nwanted accomplish in four months, because this winter was for the, like Stalin used\nto say, my best \u2014 the best general, is general winter. Well, this is what devastated\nthe German army. It devastated them to a point, you know, the Germans, they \u2014\nthey were cut clean, shaved, nicely dressed, you know, nice with their uniform, with\ntheir \u2014 with their \u2014 this was a phase. But when they \u2014 when they were encountered\nby him, when they felt this terrible winter, you know, and where they didn\u2019t have\nthe supplies, because partisans, and especially in the beginning, mostly Russian\npartisans have cut off the supplies \u2014 all the supplies line were just shattered. And\nthey were not able to get the supplies, where they had to have their lice, and they\nhad to have their \u2014 their \u2014their flea, and \u2014 and the \u2014 and th-the discomfort, and not\nhave the food in their time, and \u2014 and the rifles were \u2014 I mean, the cold winter was\nso cold their rifles were stuck, you know, they were not able to \u2014 to shoot when they\nhad to shoot. And so they \u2014 they \u2014 they start \u2014 they had different thoughts, and the \u2014\nand the punishment for those people that als \u2014 also in the camps, who were in there\nguarding the camps, was also to send them to the Russian front. The Russian front,\nthe expression to send you to the Russian front was like a sentence of death to a\nGerman soldier. So they were \u2014 an-and when they were in this state of mind, that\nthey saw that things have turned around, they also felt that they have to punish theirSeptember 22, 1994\nwhat \u2014 wer \u2014 wer \u2014 what \u2014 how can they ex-express their \u2014 their frustration, their \u2014\ntheir \u2014 their \u2014 their disappointment? They cannot say anything against their \u2014\nagainst their \u2014 a-against their leadership, because they wouldn\u2019t do that to \u2014 dare to\ndo that. So what they did is they \u2014 they put the biggest squeeze on \u2014 on the\nprisoners. They want to show their leadership that they are better equipped, they are\nbetter \u2014 they know better how to handle, how to \u2014 how to squeeze, and how to\neliminate their \u2014 their prisoners. Their \u2014 this would give them like a \u2014 like a pat on\nthe shoulder, saying you\u2019re doing a good job, you know.",
        "Q: So the only way people got out of the ghetto would be with a work brigade?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right, yeah. Some \u2014 some tried to escape, but they were \u2014",
        "Q: But the only legal way?",
        "A: \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 legal \u2014 yeah, the legal way, yeah.",
        "Q: Now you talked about some cultural activities. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what\nwas going on in the ghetto \u2014",
        "A: We had \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 did you have soup kitchens, did you have tutoring? Was there any semblance\nof normal routines?",
        "A: There were in a certain way, certain routines, like we had \u2014 like I mentioned\nabout the cultural life. We \u2014 we had like meetings whereby we had reading \u2014 beside\n77September 22, 1994\nreading the Torah, reading some scriptures or \u2014 or we had also poems. There were \u2014\nthere were composers, there were people who composed hidden music in ghetto.\nWe had \u2014 we had like hymns, which we chanted when we used to go out and \u2014 and\nwalk, and sometimes we were quietly singing, you know, the \u2014 with \u2014 with\nincredible [indecipherable] with this \u2014 the partisan hymn was created also in \u2014 in \u2014\nin the ghettos, you know [sings partisan hymn] You heard about that \u2014 no, you\ndidn\u2019t hear the partisan hymn? You are missing something.",
        "Q: Can you sing it with words?",
        "A: I-",
        "Q: You remember the words?",
        "A: I\u2014 the words, I\u2019m not \u2014 not very good in that, you know. I know it was freedom,\nyou know, it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 the hymn is about that our destiny is being written not with \u2014\nnot with bullets from in a gun, which is a Mauser, but with \u2014 with blood. And we\nexpect still to see the sunshine from the coming day, because we \u2014 we don\u2019t know\nwhat the next day 1s going to bring us, but we hope that the next day is going to give\nus a little bit more hope, more \u2014 more \u2014 more a way to survive, and to put\neverything behind us. It was basically that. That\u2019s called the partisan hymn. And of\ncourse, there were some other \u2014 some other songs that were \u2014 they were put\ntogether, and they were \u2014 had many, many times that \u2014 of course, everybody wasSeptember 22, 1994\ntired, and in the few hours, the sleep was \u2014 was essential to \u2014 to be able to get up\nnext morning at five o\u2019clock and \u2014 and \u2014 and go through that there, because we\nwere brought back in ghetto, was already nighttime, so we only had few hours. But\nwithin \u2014 even with \u2014 within this miserable life, we found ourselves certain \u2014 certain\nway of life which \u2014 which was like a shadow of the \u2014 of the normal life, you know,\nit \u2014 it \u2014 it was still \u2014 the hope was always very, very, very big, you know, it\u2019s \u2014\neverybody \u2014 especially when the front turned around, and \u2014 and we saw that the\nGermans are getting nervous, you know, and day by day they went by. Then they\nstarted with the \u2014 the aks \u2014 aktion from the children.",
        "Q: Okay, but let \u2014 let \u2014 I still want to stay on this a minute, more about what was \u2014",
        "A: But \u2014 but there \u2014 yeah \u2014 there was \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 what was going on, were kids studying, were \u2014",
        "A: They were studying. We had \u2014 we had teachers, we had like a \u2014 a \u2014 like a school,\nwithout calling that by name school. Kids were being prepared. We had a\u2014 a ma \u2014\ncertain weddings in the get \u2014 and Bar Mitzvah in the ghetto. It was \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Was this allowed, or \u2014",
        "A: It was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, they \u2014 in a certain way they \u2014 so long it was\nquiet, and no, it was not a\u2014 a rebellious trend, they \u2014 in certain occasion, they \u2014\nthey overlooked that. They wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t get [indecipherable]. We \u2014September 22, 1994\ninside the ghetto we hardly had \u2014 only in \u2014 in special cases, we had Lithuanians, or\n\u2014 they were always on the outside, they were \u2014 sometimes, if they had somebody \u2014\nbetrayed somebody, or there was something investigation, they would come in, but\nnormally \u2014 although when they would come in, they would go directly to the\nJudenrat, to Elkes, to meet with them. This was it. They met with them, and \u2014 and\nmost of the time Elkes used to go to the Gestapo and meet with \u2014 with them there,\nto the city, or to Burgermeister, the mayor of the city. But normally, within the\ncity, there was a \u2014 I mean, if you looked \u2014 I mean from \u2014 from the upper part, you\nknow, through a glass cover, and imagine you see the ghetto, you see the whole\nghetto, you would see a \u2014 a life, a going on, you know, a \u2014 almost like a normal life,\nwith \u2014 with every ingredient of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of a normal life, in a certain way. You\nhad every \u2014 you had there \u2014 you had there everything, mostly, except for the food\nwas problematic, but they find, in certain ways, you know, people that went out,\nthey came. Sometimes they overlooked \u2014 not ev \u2014 not all the times, they were very\nharsh on bringing in food. There were sometimes that the Jews have supplied the \u2014\nthe Germans with cigarettes. How did they get the cigarettes? With a question mark.\nTh-They\u2019ve got cigarettes. They \u2014",
        "Q: You \u2014 you observe the Jewish holidays?",
        "A: Yes. We knew when the holidays were. Of course, the last year was mar \u2014 more\n80September 22, 1994\ndifficult, because it was very intense, you know. But 1 \u2014 first couple of years we \u2014\nwe were able \u2014 we knew exactly where the holidays, we tried to observe them in a\ncertain way, of course not \u2014 not too \u2014 we were not able to observe them in \u2014 in \u2014\nfully, but in a certain \u2014 in a certain way we did observe them, yeah.",
        "Q: You were s \u2014 you were starting to talk about some of the actions around",
        "A: Yeah. There were \u2014 they were constantly, and \u2014 and I found out later that the\naktions were \u2014 it was a \u2014 they were systematic. They used to do that not only in\n[indecipherable], but in every single ghetto that they had. They were exactly the\nsame day, same time, same fashion. This something we found out afterwards,\nbecause it was very organized, very meticulous. Like this day, which was also a\u2014a\nincredible day, it was in \u201943, and that day I didn\u2019t go to work for some reason. You\nsee, my uncle became the \u2014 the head of the parama, of the bread distribution, they\nused to bring in bread and \u2014 and they used to \u2014 considered a very honest person, you\nknow, they \u2014 and of course, he had a few people working for him, and they would\ncome in and \u2014 and get \u2014 the distribution of the bread became something inside \u2014\ninside the ghetto. It was the \u2014 the bread brou \u2014 brought in with horses and \u2014 and\nplatforms, and then they unloaded that, and then \u2014 so, we used to live in the same\nplace, we used to \u2014 we moved from the place that we were, in a place where it was\nemptied out, and Varniu(ph) gatve was this, Varniu(ph) three. And there were theSeptember 22, 1994\ndistribution of the bread, and we lived in the \u2014 in this \u2014 this room there. And we\nwere not too far from the gate. There were like two or three gates for where \u2014 why\nyou \u2014 you would come out and thi-this gate was mostly not for the reason of \u2014 of\ngoing to work, but for the \u2014 for supplies, sometimes, when they brought into the\nghetto. We\u2019re very friendly with the horse people, you know, with this \u2014 with the \u2014\nwith the people who had the \u2014 the horses, were strong, you know, they always were\nvery friendly with my uncle. So, one day they \u2014 when everybody went to work, and\nsome reason I \u2014 I \u2014 I was home and then they \u2014 doing something. I think my uncle\nasked me to stay with him, and d-do something, which I don\u2019t remember exactly.\nSuddenly, the gates opened up from the Varniu(ph) gatve gates, you know, where\nthe supply came in, and a bunch of German \u2014 German buses came in. The windows\nwere \u2014 were blackened, you couldn\u2019t see through the window, you know? And one\nwith the loudspeaker, start announcing that nobody should move til further advice.\nAnd right away they \u2014 oh yes, I forgot to mention, that the same day, a day before,\nthey called \u2014 the Germans, the German Obersturmfihrer called up the \u2014 the head\nof the council, and told him that there is going to come in the \u2014 some German \u2014\nsome German supervisors are going to come in, because there might be a change of\nguard, and they want the police should be neatly dressed, their boots properly\nshining, their uniforms, whatever they were, the armbands, they should be all inSeptember 22, 1994\norder, because they are going to make a check on the police also. And, now going\nback, that the bosses came in to the ghetto with the loudspeaker, and the police were\ncalled \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, I know this is \u2014 [break] \u2014 only two minutes on this tape, but I think\nyou can tell this story.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: Soon as the plane stops.",
        "A: Okay. My \u2014 my aunt\u2019s brother, Chaim Levner(ph), he was a police officer.\nNice, awful nice guy. He used to live with us [indecipherable] and we used to live\ntogether. So he was also one of those officers. I mean, they \u2014 they asked for the\nwhole police force to gather, and then when they gathered, the first car that came\nout \u2014 the buses were behind, the first car came out, it\u2019s like a\u2014 a Jeep, and came out\nthree Germans, and this was \u2014 and I was watching through the window what\nhappened, I was inside the house. And they told to the police, they \u2014 to get in \u2014 into\n\u2014 in two lines, one behind the other one, three lines. And three rows\n[indecipherable]. And then they told them \u2014 they asked each of them they should\nmention their name. And right afterward, they told them they should sit down on the\nground, suddenly. So everybody sat down, you know, in this, in this way, you\nknow, crossing \u2014 crossing the leg. My uncle \u2014 my aunt\u2019s brother, for some reason \u2014September 22, 1994\nI mean, apparently he had a feeling that something is wrong there. He gets\nconvulsions, and he was not able to sit down. So the chairman just pulled out the\ngun and just shot him, right there. And I was in \u2014 in \u2014 that was right in front of me,\nin the \u2014 in the window. And then, he was carried away, and then they took all the\npolice, and they put them in \u2014 in the \u2014 in the first \u2014 1n the first bus, everybody,\nincluding the chief, everybody. And right after that, they started the children\u2019s\naktion. Was to take out all the children that were still left, and \u2014 the children and\nthe elderly people. We had in our \u2014 there, where we had the bread supply, we had a\n\u2014a-\u2014a basement. And we were able to bring down my \u2014 my cousin, and place her\nthere, you know. And this was the last time that we were \u2014 that we felt that she\nshould remain in the ghetto, because we felt that \u2014 and th-this day, they took away \u2014\nthey took away all the children. They went from house, to house, and they pulled\nout the children and elderly people, and they took them out. And of course, you\nknow where they took them. Now, when the people came from the brigades home \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry \u2014\nEnd of Tape FiveSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Okay. We were talking about the children being \u2014",
        "A: Where \u2014 where \u2014 where \u2014 where in the ghetto, at the children\u2019s aktion, it was\nspecially devised to get out all of the children from the ghetto. And in order to\nimplement that, they had also to take out all the police because this was also \u2014 there\nwere also children from the police officers, and \u2014 and you know how a father would\nreact seeing his child being dragged and beaten and taken to a \u2014 to a bus and then\ntaken away. So after this \u2014 this happened \u2014 and this was very fast, you know, they \u2014\nthey had a big number of \u2014 of gendarmes, of SS people who \u2014 who implemented\nthis function. They went from house to house and they \u2014 they knew exactly which\nhouse had children. They had already a list. Apparently, previously they have \u2014 they\nhave asked for the \u2014 for the composition of the people who lived in the \u2014 in each \u2014\nin each house. You know, it was \u2014 so they \u2014 they had certain records, or somebody\ngave them the records. And they indiscriminately \u2014 I mean, they have \u2014 they have\nwalked into each house, pulled out \u2014 pulled out the children. And most of the\nchildren were \u2014 especially the \u2014 the older ones were \u2014 their mothers were \u2014 were at\nwork at this time. There were only a number of mothers who, when they took the\nchildren, they didn\u2019t want to go with their kids. They wouldn't let them \u2014 let them\nstay with the kids, so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then theySeptember 22, 1994\ntook away the children. And the mothers were devastated. And especially now at \u2014\nat six, seven o'clock, when the people start returning from \u2014 from work, and when\nthey found out this news, it was such a outcry. It was such a tremendous outcry that\n\u2014 that ev \u2014 everybody was crying and everybody was \u2014 was \u2014 was devastated. It was\nsomething that some people throw themse \u2014 threw themself on the \u2014 on the barbed\nwire, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to see whether they just can just get out and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014\nand do something. And people \u2014 really, the mothers didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t care \u2014 care for\ntheir life anymore. They \u2014 they \u2014 they just wanted to join them, to be together with\ntheir \u2014 with their children. And the police officers \u2014 the way we \u2014 we found out\nlater, they were \u2014 they were investigated, to find out whether there are some kids\nwho were hidden, like we were \u2014 we hid the \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin, who was really\nabout, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years. And\nbesides that, they want also to know where \u2014 because they had information at that\ntime \u2014 It was already \u201844 and they knew that there were many, many, many, many\nfreedom fighters who \u2014 who st \u2014 his \u2014 have still a communication with the ghetto,\nand they had apparently \u2014 it was felt that \u2014 also that the police \u2014 certain police\nofficer have helped some, and still helping some of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the freedom\nfighter. So they wanted to find out, and they shot quite a number of police officers.\nThey shot this Greenberg(ph) who \u2014 who \u2014 who was very instrumental. They\n86September 22, 1994\ntortured him and shot him, and he would not divulge, and would not give out where\nthe \u2014 where the hiding places were. And then the rest of those police officers, they \u2014\npart of them \u2014 they returned back \u2014 back to the ghetto, became devastated and found\nalso their \u2014 their children gone. And the \u2014 it was really \u2014 the \u2014 the feeling, I mean,\nwas \u2014 that was so bad, you know, that the \u2014 the whole situation created an\nincredible loss of \u2014 of hope, you know, when you saw something like this. And this\nwas March and it \u2014 it was already when the Russians have advanced already,\nsubstantially towards \u2014 towards the west \u2014 towards \u2014 towards \u2014 they liberated\nalready many, many cities in \u2014 in Russia and they were \u2014 they were moving\ntowards \u2014 towards Lithuania. And that was an episode which is \u2014 which was very,\nvery tragic, you know, very \u2014 even difficult to \u2014 to describe this. This is \u2014\nsometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and \u2014 and we\nexchange \u2014 exchange views. And the \u2014 the \u2014 the question is, between one survivor\nand the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through. I mean,\nthis is \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you see, you are limited in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in being able to\nunderstand it when \u2014 when somebody tells you something, you know, that\u2019s \u2014\nbecause their \u2014 our \u2014 our minds are \u2014 are in a certain way limited. We cannot\nunderstand beyond this limit, you know. And it is, how can somebody describe\ncertain things that like? How can somebody describe that a German SS man takes a\n87September 22, 1994\nchild of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes him with his head against \u2014\nagainst a wall? I mean, how can \u2014 I mean, this is \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not even \u2014 even in\nthe most substandard countries, I mean, it\u2019s happening, you know. They \u2014 they kill\npeople, they massacre people, but \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 and\nit\u2019s hard to describe and it\u2019s hard to believe. Sometimes I myself, it\u2019s hard for me to\nbelieve that \u2014 that \u2014 it looks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly\nhappened, you know. An-And \u2014 and time was going so slow, you know. The \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t even mention some other work that I used to do, you know. They took us to\nthe \u2014 to the army barracks in \u2014 sometimes and we had to clean out latrines and\nsomething else, you know, they \u2014 and some \u2014 sometimes they took some people and\nthey just threw them into the latrine, I know, just only to \u2014 to have a little pastime\nfor themselves, you know. So I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s beyond \u2014 beyond description.\nSo that\u2019s \u2014 so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we meet together with survivors\nsometimes, and we share experiences, we \u2014 we \u2014 we can understand it much better\nthan \u2014 than \u2014 than explaining that to the outer world, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 and it\u2019s\nvery hard to believe that a country so advanced, you know, was \u2014 was get \u2014 getting\nchildren and then [indecipherable] and all this. That were \u2014 that were able \u2014\nthat wer \u2014 came down to a level, to such a level, to \u2014 to \u2014 to be so destructive and soSeptember 22, 1994\nwithout hearts, without \u2014 so the ghetto was \u2014 th-this was a \u2014 at that \u2014 at that stage, it\nwas already a camp, yeah. Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot\nkeep our \u2014 my uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daughter there. So we\nmade contact through a \u2014 there was a rabbi\u2019s wife, Shuman(ph) was her name. And\nI\u2019m sure that she \u2014 she is going to surface in some of your \u2014 some of the places. She\nwas a \u2014 an incredible lady. She was a rabbi\u2019s wife. Her husband was in Israel \u2014 in\nPalestine already. And she \u2014 some way he left before that. And she was\nmatchmaking. She was out \u2014 without the \u2014 without the \u2014 the stars. She was going\naround and finding places to harbor children. So some \u2014 somebody told us about her\nand we were in \u2014 contacted her, and \u2014 and she found a place for Sulami(ph), which\nwas my \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin. She was three and a half, or four years old at that time.\nMy \u2014 my aunt laughs always, she says that I\u2014 I \u2014 I used to have an incredible\nappetite, you know. And I used to watch, you know \u2014 she used to give her \u2014\nsometimes we were able to smuggle in tapioca. You know what is? It\u2019s a\u2014 and I\nused to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it\nwould be left over for me to eat. So she always \u2014 so we decided to do \u2014 how would\n\u2014 we would do that. At that time, we had two SS people in the ghetto. One name\nwas Fiffiger(ph) and the other name was \u2014 what was the other name? It will come\nto me pretty soon. Yeah, it\u2019s [indecipherable] Fiffiger(ph) was a former teacherSeptember 22, 1994\nand he was \u2014 very much befriended my uncle. He was very nice. He was a SS, and\nhe told the story that he was forced into the SS. And he \u2014 he expressed very good\nsentiments. So my uncle had to put his confidence \u2014 he showed in \u2014 in few cases, he\nshowed that he was \u2014 he was helpful. And we could see that he is not one of these \u2014\none of these beasts, you know. So my uncle explained to him and \u2014 and he knew\nthat we are having the child there, and \u2014 against all odds, and he promised my uncle\nthat he is going to help him out. This was a remarkable \u2014 but his comrade, his\nfriend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite. Just the opposite. What he did\nonce was also beyond \u2014 he encouraged people \u2014 he opened up the \u2014 he opened up\nth-this \u2014 anyway, first, let me finish with Fiffiger(ph). So they arranged that the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the bread was coming in twice a week with these big platforms, and then the\nhorses with a driver were going out. So we arranged to \u2014 I gave her the sleeping\npill. We put her in a bag because they \u2014 it used to come in bags. So we put her in\none of the bags. And we put her under a big \u2014 so they \u2014 she can go through the \u2014\nthrough the gates. Because the gates, they always used to stick something to find\nwhere there\u2019s sometimes hide. But it was already prearranged, you know, that\napparently he \u2014 he \u2014 he did that \u2014 Fiffiger(ph) did that, you know. And we were\nable to get her out and she was given away to \u2014 to a very nice Lithuanian family.\nThey took care \u2014 they even baptized her and made her like a part of the \u2014 and sheSeptember 22, 1994\nspoke only Lithuanian and she was \u2014 she fortunately survived. In exchange, my\nuncle \u2014 the police officer who was shot, his little boy was also given out to\nsomebody. But he was betrayed and they killed him. Apparently, this Lithuanian\nthat took him was given \u2014 were given certain things in order to do that. They\nbetrayed him and he was \u2014 and we found out later that he was \u2014 he was killed. So \u2014",
        "Q: Do you want to take a break now, or \u2014",
        "A: Let me just finish with the \u2014 it will come back, the name of the other guy, you\nknow. He was a bad, bad \u2014I should have written down. Yeah, so he \u2014 what he \u2014 he\nformed \u2014 it was already March, April \u2014 it was already \u2014 the ghetto already knew\nthat it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s still a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014a little bit of hope on the horizon. So he let out\nthe word that he is going to \u2014 that he 1s going to let out some people to escape. And\nhe opened up a-\u2014 a hole in \u2014 was in the fence. And needless to say, he was with a\nmachine gun there, and he killed like 14 people there, claiming that they tried to\nescape. So that was SS. Sturmfihrer. [break]",
        "Q: Another thing I think I asked you before \u2014 why don\u2019t we \u2014",
        "A: You want I should tell also about the escape, or \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Tell me a little bit about the ghetto becoming an official\nconcentration camp.",
        "A: Well, towards the end of the 1943, we s \u2014 we saw certain movements in aSeptember 22, 1994\ndifferent direction. We \u2014 we felt that there is some kind of changes going to be\nimplemented in the ghetto. And we really didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t know exactly. We felt that\nthe guards were changed. We have \u2014 we have seen more \u2014 that was also a time\nwhen we have seen more Hungarians. They brought in Hungarians, and especially\nsome truck drivers. One \u2014 one of them, which I knew pretty well, he was a very bad\nmouth, and \u2014 but he was not \u2014 not so bad. But the rest were very bad. He was\nHaymushi(ph). He was a Hungarian truck driver who \u2014 who worked very close\nwith \u2014 with Pilgrim(ph) and \u2014 and Fiffiger(ph). He was, like, always with them.\nAnd we felt that by bringing in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more\nrestrictions, and \u2014 and start \u2014 they started also watching more of the \u2014 all the\nmovements and what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happening in the ghetto. And they were\nvery much concerned and very much were \u2014 were looking for \u2014 for some kind of\nsupplies that the ghetto would supply, or the ghetto would produce, or the ghetto\nwould have some contacts with \u2014 with the \u2014 with the freedom fighters. So in order\nto have a tighter watch, they \u2014 they have also tried to squeeze out from the police\nand see whether their police \u2014 to find within the police also some people who\nwould \u2014 who would be on \u2014 on their side. They were not \u2014 were not too much able\nto \u2014 they had not been able to get from the \u2014 from the Jewish police, except in \u2014 in\nisolated case \u2014 cases, because the police was well aware of what \u2014 what wasSeptember 22, 1994\nhappening. And they \u2014 they themselves \u2014 the ghetto was the \u2014 with the council in\nmany occasions \u2014 and many cases have tried to help. And they were \u2014 they knew\nalso sometimes the whereabouts of \u2014 of people who \u2014 who would go out to the\nforest an-and fight and in different measures and acts of terrorism and \u2014 and\nblowing up railroads, and sh \u2014 cutting off supplies, and \u2014 and shooting in many\ncases, in back of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the Germans. Although the Germans themselves,\nlike \u2014 the Germans themselves, they \u2014 they \u2014 most of the time didn\u2019t dare to invade\nthe forest, because the forest was for them, taboo. But they used for that purpose,\nthey used Lithuanians, in many cases, to \u2014 to find out and to find out the right spots\nand then they would \u2014 they would be able to \u2014 to move in. We also saw the \u2014 not\nonly by \u2014 by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we \u2014 we have felt a\nbigger presence in the ghetto of \u2014 of the military. Because normally, in all those\nyears, they were \u2014 they were, most of the times, guar-guarding the ghetto from the\noutside and they were hardly \u2014 not too frequently, they \u2014 they used to come in and \u2014\nand \u2014 and look for themselves, look in in certain aspects of the ghetto. Now, in the\nlate \u201843, we have \u2014 we had a\u2014 a much bigger presence. There were also a repetition\nof \u2014 of people that \u2014 of requirements for \u2014 for labor force in some other \u2014 other\nplaces within Lithuania and \u2014 and outside of Lithuania, whereby they used to\ncome and \u2014 and of course, make a selection, or they used to appeal to the \u2014 to theSeptember 22, 1994\ncouncil in order to provide them with \u2014 with \u2014 with those elements who can be\nuseful for them. And most of the times, they \u2014 they \u2014 some of the times they also\ntried to get some people who \u2014 who had some skills, and tried to use them in the\nbest of their \u2014 their ability. We have seen also that factories, in the \u2014 the\nverstattin(ph) have been over swamped with \u2014 with additional work. As the front\nwas getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to \u2014 for \u2014 for\n\u2014 for the Germans, for their supplies, and they needed the \u2014 the help and the \u2014 and\nthe cooperation of this verstattin(ph), so they used to work overtime. I mean,\ninstead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know. And they also\nimplemented some shifts in that time. The \u2014 the underground movement grew faster\nand faster. They \u2014 they had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians\nby themselves also were not dumb. They saw that the tide is changing. So they, in\nmany cases, they tried to befriend, and \u2014 and to be a little bit more helpful.\nAlthough, the \u2014 the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody that they\nwould have a [indecipherable]. But we have seen that they \u2014 they were more\naggressive in \u2014 in hiding people and in helping and \u2014 and in trying to make up for\nthe \u2014 for the damages that they have done before. When the \u2014 in 1944, after the \u2014\nafter the children\u2019s aktion, and after we have \u2014 we have brought out our \u2014 my\ncousin from \u2014 from the ghetto, I myself started thinking of terms of \u2014 of getting\n94September 22, 1994\naway. I was in contact 1n two cases, in two ca \u2014",
        "Q: I have to ask you to say that again because of the airplane. What are you going to\ntell me about now? Are you going to tell me about your escape?",
        "A: Mm-hm. The guards, and \u2014 and more frequently coming into the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the\nghetto. I didn't see, really a \u2014 I mean, they were as brutal as they used to be because\nthis \u2014 especially the \u2014 the \u2014 the foreigners \u2014 the Hungarians, they were not \u2014 they\nwere not good people, you know that \u2014 especially there. They were \u2014 they were as\nbrutal as they are, maybe some \u2014 some \u2014 some more than \u2014 than the others in \u2014 in\nmany, many occasions. This [indecipherable] the truck driver, I mean, he\nwas [indecipherable] that time when I \u2014 I mentioned about letting \u2014 deceiving the\npeople and telling them they can escape and so forth and so on, because people have\nstarted feeling there, the air has changed, in the sense that the front was getting\ncloser and closer. And the question was when and how fast. At the same time, they\nstarted getting preparations for \u2014 for \u2014 to liquidate the ghetto. Apparently this was\nmentioned in \u2014 in a \u2014 in few occasions that \u2014 that pretty soon they have already\norders in place in order to eliminate the ghetto, and to \u2014 and to take out all those\nremains of the \u2014 of the people. At that time, I think \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure that in the\nghetto were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now \u2014 maybe now\nfrom 33,000 that originally \u2014 so what they did is also \u2014 when \u2014 when they \u2014 whenSeptember 22, 1994\nthey used to \u2014 when the ghetto became smaller \u2014 small-smaller in \u2014 1n \u2014 in\npopulation, they also start cutting off smaller in territory. What they did is, where\nwe had the Varniu(ph) gatve where the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the [indecipherable] was\nthe gate for the supplies, there was a \u2014 a\u2014 a number of houses that one day they\ncame in and they took a \u2014 a\u2014a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove\nthe fence that was the original fence. What they did is, they put in another fence,\ncutting off, like, four or five blocks from the \u2014 from the original one. So it became\nlike a ghetto within a ghetto, you know. This was, in a certain way, to my personal\nadvantage, you know, because \u2014 and maybe some others, which I \u2014 I \u2014 I do \u2014I don\u2019t\nknow. I can speak for myself on it. What they did is, actually by \u2014 by putting a new\nfence and putting guards \u2014 putting guards around this fence, they have diminished\nthe guards from the overall fence, which was before, even without taking off. So,\nwhat happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided \u2014 I have a\u2014 had a\n\u2014 we were five \u2014 five people that we decided to \u2014 to flee the camp. We saw that \u2014\nalready that the time is running out. I spoke to \u2014 three times to one friend of mine\nthat was in the \u2014 was in the \u2014 in the partisans. And he told me that whenever I want\nto join them I should \u2014 I should contact somebody, and \u2014 1n order to join them. The\nonly thing 1s, after that I tried to get the \u2014 the other \u2014 th-the contact man and he was\nalready gone, also. So I went to my \u2014 where my uncle was and I told him, look, I\n96September 22, 1994\nthink that it\u2019s no \u2014 no reason for me to remain here. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re\nclose. We\u2019re very close to the end. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 they are going \u2014 one of these days,\nwe are going to get up and we\u2019re going to find ourselves surrounded by \u2014 by trucks\nand they are \u2014 they are just going to take us, and \u2014 and \u2014 and ta-take us out and \u2014\nand take us to camps, or take us somewhere else, or \u2014 or \u2014 or take us to the Ninth\nFort. So my uncle, who was very conservative always \u2014 and he really was very\nclose to me, was \u2014 was like \u2014 like a father to me, you know. And th-this was maybe\none of reasons that \u2014 that I have not left the place sooner. And especially my\ngrandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she [indecipherable] that time\nwhen I saved her, you know, she \u2014 she would not \u2014 and we knew that she \u2014 she \u2014\nalso \u2014 also survived, you know, the \u2014 the children\u2019s aktion that time also when \u2014\nbecause she was with a child inside, but her, we couldn\u2019t get \u2014 get her out, because\nwell, it would be too \u2014 too difficult, you know. A child is something that \u2014 el-else.\nSo what \u2014 so my uncle came to the conclusion, say that\u2019s fine and gave me his\nblessing, I mean, it \u2014 and I deciding to \u2014 now, how are we going to do it? SoI-\u2014I\ndevised a plan, in other word, the houses which were behind the first \u2014 the general\nfence, a few houses still left. They have \u2014 normally, in many cases they would\nexplode some of the houses. They would put in some dynamite and explode it.\nHere, they \u2014 they have \u2014 and \u2014 and they did it later on with the r\u2014 with the \u2014 withSeptember 22, 1994\nthe rest of the ghetto. So I had a \u2014I had three more people with me \u2014 three \u2014 four.\nThere was one \u2014 one guy that was himself from Poland and for \u2014 some way he was\nstuck in \u2014 in \u2014 in Kovno, and never was able to get out. And then it was the nephew\nof \u2014 the nephew of my aunt, who is now in Charlotte, North Carolina. And then\nthe other one was a guy that used to \u2014 frequently to come to our house. And then it\nwas the other fellow that worked also with \u2014 was a nephew of somebody who\nworked with my \u2014 with my uncle. So, then this guy knew \u2014 supposedly he knew the\nroad, how to \u2014 I mean, where to go in order to get to the forest.",
        "Q: You know what \u2014",
        "A: The forest was \u2014 what \u2014 yeah, okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 I have to stop you, sir. The reason 1s, I think that people \u2014",
        "A: Okay. I'll make that sh-short, you know. Okay. We were five, we have\naccumulated some supplies in one of the houses. And one day when we came back\nfrom work, we have \u2014 we \u2014 we just defected from the \u2014 from \u2014 from the group,\nwhich was large group, when we came back from work. And we went into this\nhouse and then we watched the out guard \u2014 the outside guard \u2014 we had also special\npliers to cut \u2014 to cut the wire. We have \u2014 wait til the night. On that third day, we\ncut through \u2014 in our supplies what we had was water, sugar, and bread. We \u2014 we\nwatched \u2014 we timed the guards that was walking, we cut through the wires, and we\n98September 22, 1994\njust came out. And we \u2014 it was nighttime and we were not able to go too far because\nnight \u2014 nighttime, it was \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was very dangerous to go, because you\u2019re\nable \u2014 I mean, they would stop you and then right away there, you would be\nfinished. So we hid in a \u2014 in a \u2014 next to a house in the garden, where it was dense\nbushes and we stayed there for \u2014 for a \u2014 for the night. And then early morning, we\nleft and we went towards the woods \u2014 towards the woods which was Janava. That\nwas a\u2014a place where there were al \u2014 there already some partisans were \u2014 were\nworking \u2014 were working in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the exploding some supplies \u2014\nsome supplies for the Germans and so on. Okay. We had to go through to a \u2014\nthrough a main highway. And when we walked, we walked like in one behind the\nother one. So when we reached the highway \u2014 and this was during the daytime\nalready, a guy with a \u2014 with a bicycle and was dressed 1n \u2014 in civilian but with a\nrifle, was there waiting for us. And when we approached him, I mean, he took off\nthe rifle and he said, your documents. Okay. We start running in different\ndirections. This was outside the city, you know, it was a big field of potatoes and \u2014\nand corn. So \u2014",
        "Q: Stop.\nEnd of Tape SixSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: The details, I have no knowledge of the details.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I know certain \u2014 certain ca \u2014 was in the camp, you know, but there is nothing\nthat I was able personally to \u2014 personally to \u2014 to verify, you know. So \u2014 okay. So\nwe \u2014 we Start, and this guy took off his rifle and started shooting one of the five. I\nmean, he hid and then I found out later that they killed him. Four of us, we\ndispersed and I ran in one direction to the cornfield. And I saw some \u2014 it was really\nlate during the day and I\u2014I-\u2014I-",
        "Q: You know something?",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: I hate to ask you to do this, but I\u2019m actually \u2014 I'm concerned because this is on\ntwo tapes. [break]",
        "A: Towards the beginning of \u201844, we have seen with a \u2014 with a change also, the\nstatus of the ghetto \u2014 from the ghetto to a concentration camp. We felt a new \u2014 a\nnew arrangements and \u2014 and some things \u2014 certain things \u2014 certain changes which\nwe \u2014 it was not too hard for us to figure out. We saw that the handwriting on the\nwall. We saw that everything what\u2019s happening with the Russian army, the\nvictorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards \u2014 towards the \u2014 towards the\n100September 22, 1994\nwest. And we felt also that there is time for \u2014 for me and for some friends to \u2014 to get\nout and get out as soon as possible because every \u2014 every day was a matter that \u2014\nwe knew exactly that \u2014 what our fate was going to be. So truthfully, we didn't have\ntoo much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would \u2014 we would\nnot be able to survive. So I went to see my uncle and I told him that \u2014 and my\ngrandmother, I told them that I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m ready, with \u2014 with my other fellow \u2014\nfellow friends to \u2014 to get out, and to get out as fast. So my uncle I \u2014 my uncle also\ngave me a\u2014 he had like a little golden coin and he gave this to me and he said, look,\nin case of necessity or something, I mean, you \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he had like three of them,\nyou know, so he was hiding that always in \u2014 somewhere. So when \u2014 soon I got\ntogether with my \u2014 with my friends and when we went to work, coming back we\njust evaded the guards and we came into one of the houses that we marked for \u2014 for\nour shelter in \u2014 in \u2014 in between, in order to be able to \u2014 to plan our \u2014 our escape.\nThe \u2014 one of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a\nshort one, and we used him as the outlook. So he used to look and to watch. And he\nwas the one that timed the steps of the \u2014 of the guard on the outside of the fence,\nand then came to the conclusion. He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut\nthrough the wires and that was nighttime. And we just slipped out, all of us.\nBecause we \u2014 really the security was behind us in the \u2014 in the smaller ghetto whereSeptember 22, 1994\nthere was double-rolled barbed wire. This was all \u2014 this was a old fence which they\nhave never tried to repair because they were \u2014 there was \u2014 the ghetto was in the\nghetto, you know. Now, when we had to \u2014 we slept over there in a\u2014ina\u2014ina\ngarden, a dense garden. And in the morning we start going. But we left a distance\nbetween ourselves. Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one,\nsome meters, one behind the other one. When we came through a \u2014 through a \u2014 with\na bo \u2014 to a place where we had to cross the highway, there was one person with a \u2014\nwith a bicycle, and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian. And suddenly he came out\nand approached us, say, stop, documents. Raise your hands. So when he did that, we\nstart running in different directions. It was only one person and we knew that he\nmight shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. Besides that, his aim\nwas not too good because I felt \u2014 when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me\nand then I don't know. I \u2014I\u2014 I really ran like never in my life, and then I threw\nmyself in the cornfield. I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a\nwhile, I know that they \u2014 they had some \u2014 some people with horses try to locate\nsomebody, and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. But I, during\nnighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble \u2014 flickering lights.\nAnd I say to myself, without these \u2014 would that be headquarter \u2014 would \u2014 would\nthat be quarters for the Germans or some barracks or something? Then I steppedSeptember 22, 1994\naway and I found myself close to a small, small woods. And there I slept over the\nnight. It was really \u2014 it was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with\nleaves and some other things. And there was a little \u2014 a little \u2014 I wouldn't say a\nriver, but it was little place with \u2014 with water. And then I \u2014 I was hiding behind the\nbushes. In the morning, I heard some voices 1n Russian, and I \u2014 I watched that, and\nI saw that there \u2014 there, a woman came and she \u2014 apparently two friends, but one\nstayed with a \u2014 with a metal thing, you know, what they \u2014 they put here \u2014 put in\ncloth. And she started washing right there in this \u2014 where there was li \u2014 this was not\neven like a river, but it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. I had my\nhat, so with my hat I used to take and \u2014 and \u2014 and drink the water. Because food\nwas nothing. I \u2014 I used to collect some \u2014 some berries, you know, from wild berries,\nand this was my food. So I was desperate. I was very hungry and this woman was\nwashing and I said to myself, let me \u2014 let me approach her. And I spoke perfect\nRussian, of course. So I came out. I said, look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m escapee, and like you\nshould help me with some food. So I was not sure whether she was going to go \u2014\nfirst of all, I didn\u2019t know. I asked her what was there in this \u2014 in this place, where I\nsaw the flickering lights in the night. And she said, no, that\u2019s a camp, a civilian ca-\ncamp for civilian Russians. An intern camp for civilian Russians. But then she told\nme that she is going to come back and bring me some food. And I \u2014 I thought toSeptember 22, 1994\nmyself, I prayed, I said, or she is going to bring me food, or she is going to bring me\na German who is going to \u2014 to kill me? About 15 minutes later she comes back with\na bottle of milk and a piece of spee(ph) \u2014 you know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s from \u2014 it\u2019s like\nmeat, fat meat, you know \u2014 and a piece of bread. And then I started talking to her\nand she said to me that she got scared when she saw me, because I looked like I\u2019m\nan old, you know, the \u2014 and I explained to her that I\u2019m a refugee, and so forth. And\nso she said to me, look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who \u2014 who fled,\nand who are hiding in our \u2014 in this \u2014 in this camp. And they also are going to \u2014 they\nare planning to go to join the \u2014 the freedom fighters, the partisans. And where they\nare going? They are going to Janava, Janava, Belder(ph), that used to be Janava,\nthe forest of Janava, which was not too far away from there. And this guy\nScheiker(ph), that was with me, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was leaving us, and he told us, and he\nexplained to me, because he himself was from Janava, and he told us \u2014 he gave me\ncertain \u2014 certain parameters. But now, I mean, he was \u2014 he was gone, so I had to do\nthat myself. So then, in the \u2014 in the evening, sh-sh \u2014 the two Russians came over.\nThey had knives for themselves, and they asked me a few questions, and they\nwanted to verify whether I am legit and I shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 I shouldn't be some \u2014 the\nbay \u2014 betray them. And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went to the\nwoods, we approached them, and one of them had apparently a contact, or he knew\n104September 22, 1994\nexactly a certain spot. First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very\nfriendly by the Russians, because Stalin\u2019s \u2014 Stalin\u2019s view was that the Russians\nshould never fell in a prisoner life, I mean, he should give his life for the country.\nBut of course, this \u2014 that was not the case. So he took us to the forms \u2014 forest at one\npoint and he \u2014 then we met about three or four more guys there. They were from\nthe \u2014 from \u2014 apparently also, they were former Russian prisoners. And they had\nalready a plan, a top \u2014 topographic plan, and they had all rolls. So they said that\nthey have received some supplies from \u2014 from parachutes that they \u2014 and they had\nsome assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going \u2014 if\nthey are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do\ncertain sabotage \u2014 sabotage work. We spent about, I would say, maybe about close\nto 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one, because we didn\u2019t want to\nstay in one spot. And on few occasions \u2014 I was not trained, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nanything about \u2014 about ammunition or anything. They have done, basically, the\nwork. And the \u2014 in \u2014 in different cases, I was the look out. They used me to be the\nlook out. They had some \u2014 some light arms and knives basically, and they had some\nback packs with \u2014 with ammunition. We spent, I would say, about four weeks. And\none \u2014 one day, we heard a movement. We put our ears \u2014 normally, what we used to\ndo is, we used to put our ears to the grounds, so we can detect \u2014 that\u2019s a way of\n105September 22, 1994\ndetect whether there is some heavy movements. And here we detected that some \u2014\nbased on our imaginations, some tanks. And now we saw about three or four\nGerman tanks rolling not too far away, you know. And then about a couple hours\nlater, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. And this whole\nneighborhood vicinity became like a \u2014 like a \u2014 like a military, I mean, hell. Because\nbullets and flying out the \u2014 in the shrubs, and saw burning \u2014 burning bushes and all\nthis, you know. It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire. Then, it lasted for\nabout an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you\nknow. Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, now we\nare going to be killed by \u2014 by friendly \u2014 by friendly \u2014 our friendly power \u2014 gun\npower. Suddenly, it quietened down. It was quiet like nothing \u2014 I mean, like \u2014 like\nnothing ever \u2014 anything happened, you know. And I say to the \u2014 to one of Russians,\nI say, what \u2014 what would that be? I mean it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s too quiet, I mean, we got used\nalready to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the incredible sound of \u2014 of \u2014 of explosions, you\nknow. And then suddenly we heard again, we put \u2014 the Russian put his \u2014 he put his\near on the ground. He said, something is happening. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s quite apparently, but\nsomething is happening. And, like 45 minutes later, we heard \u2014 we heard some\nmovement of, like, troops. Not too many. And then we saw the first Russians\napproaching us. And the first question was \u2014 the first question was, have you seen\n106September 22, 1994\nsome tanks? I sort of, yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago. And he said, no, these\ntanks already finished. Have you seen some other tanks? And we say, no. Right\naway it was \u2014 I was amazed, you know, because right away I \u2014 I was approached by\n\u2014 by one of the lieutenants. I think it was a captain, not a lieutenant \u2014 captain,\nbecause he had three stars, yeah. It was a captain, and he \u2014 he actually told me\nthat \u2014 he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? I say yes. So am\nI, he said. Okay, we embraced each other and he \u2014 right away what he did is, he told\nus \u2014 he said, look, this is the front line, and the line might change, because we don\u2019t\nknow what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what is ha \u2014 what can \u2014 what is going to happen a few\nkilometers from here. My advice is, and what I want to see you, is to the till. Till 1s\ntowards the back, towards the [indecipherable], you know, towards the back, you\nknow. And right away, he called a\u2014 a\u2014a soldier and he said, take these guys and\ntake them over. And \u2014 and in meantime, we was already approaching some Jeeps\nand some \u2014 some other \u2014 some other military units. And he told us to move as far as\npossible towards the back. He said, you went through already, it\u2019s sufficient. I\nmean, it\u2019s \u2014 and th-this was the \u2014 this was actually the \u2014 the \u2014 the way that we \u2014 so\nhappy. I mean, the first time we felt like \u2014 felt like liberated, you know. And then he\nasked me \u2014 another guy that he referred me to ask me some question. He said me\nwhether I want to join the army, or I want to do. I said, no, no, first what I want toSeptember 22, 1994\ndo is, I want to go \u2014 I want to see \u2014 because my question was, how soon are they\ngoing to liberate Kaunas? He said, that might take still a few days or \u2014 or it might\nstill take some \u2014 some time. So we were with the army for about \u2014 I think about ten\nor 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] Kaunas and to liberate it. I went right\naway to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the ghetto. The ghetto was exploded. Everything, all the\nhouses were exploded. They have \u2014 some people came out from the hiding in some\nplaces. Some people came out from hiding. I went to this place where we were\nhiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. But supplies\nand other things that we had in \u2014 in our \u2014 in our house, and in the ground was\nnothing. It was like, everything burned. And right away I went to \u2014 to Kaunas. This\nwas Slobodka. I went to Kaunas, I got myself \u2014 right away I met with this officer,\nthat he told me that he is going to \u2014 he is \u2014 I mean, that he 1s going to be coming to\nKaunas, and he gave me a number where I can \u2014 I can reach him. And he told me\nthat if I have some \u2014 some kind of desire of some \u2014 something. I said, yeah, I would\nlike to have \u2014 I have some \u2014 I have some relatives here, and I would like to see\nwhether I can find them. Where \u2014 where are there \u2014 I\u2014 I am sure \u2014 I felt they were\nvery optimistic. I said maybe there are some relatives that I have. And I start\nfloundering around for quite a few days. And then I found a family, that we were\ntogether in the ghetto and then later, they went to Canada. But I used to send themSeptember 22, 1994\npackages when I was in there \u2014 when \u2014 just a minute \u2014 that I send them packages\nafter, when I \u2014 when I \u2014 when I was in the army. They \u2014 I helped them to find a\nplace \u2014 a living place because the \u2014 the city was \u2014 was devastated, you know. There\n\u2014 there was not too many \u2014 too big fights in the city, but it was many have escaped\nand left behind themselves apartments with furniture, and you know, like \u2014 the\nsame way like when the \u2014 when the \u2014 when the Germans came in. So right away I\nfound a\u2014a friend of mine, who told me that if I would like to serve \u2014 to serve in the\n\u2014 in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, and I\nspeak the \u2014 I speak Lithuanian, German, and \u2014 an-and Russian, so I would be a\ngood prospect. He se \u2014 he told me that there is coming a \u2014 a group of \u2014 a\u2014 a group\nof people to \u2014 of military men to take some \u2014 to take \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 they are looking for\nsome inper \u2014 interpreter. They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and\nRussian. Basically German is not, at this point, is not important, but it\u2019s going to\nbecome important later. And at the same time, they promulgated a law that all these\npeople from this and this year, they are going to be \u2014 they are going to be from\n1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken to the army \u2014 to the regular army. And\nI say to myself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than \u2014 than to wait and then\nbe recruited to the army. They have like a place where they called wayan(ph)\nkomat(ph). This is a\u2014 a\u2014a military place, whereby they check out new \u2014 theySeptember 22, 1994\ncheck out prospective soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have TB\nbecause there were many with \u2014 with TB, you know, from those that survived. So I\nactually signed up for this \u2014 for this unit. I remember a younger captain came in\nand \u2014 and interviewed me and he was satisfied. And then what he told me that he is\ngoing to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation \u2014 military\npreparation of about six weeks. And I agreed. In meantime, he told me I can \u2014 I can\nstay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a\u2014a-\u2014a\napartment. So I found my relatives, those I mentioned, and I found myself not too\nfar away where I used to live before, on the same [indecipherable] on same main\nstreet. I got myself a nice apartment and my relatives were very happy. They had\ntwo children and \u2014 and myself and I told them, look, I am going to be just here, and\nonly temporary, and I am \u2014 I am going to be leaving. And also, was very interesting\nwalking on the \u2014 when I got myself a bicycle an-and riding on the bike, I met a very\ngood friend of mine, this Harmutz(ph), who was the \u2014 the head of the ORT. He\nwasn\u2019t in the ghetto and he was involved in the partisans. And he esca \u2014 I mean, he\njoined in also in the army but in the civilian department. They made him a \u2014 like a\ncommissar, or something, in the civilian department because he \u2014 he had excellent\ncontacts in the \u2014 with some high-ranking people. So I met with him and it was\nincredible, incredible meeting, you know, to \u2014 in \u2014 in middle of \u2014 of \u2014 of nowhereSeptember 22, 1994\nor something like, you know, in the middle of the city, to meet somebody that was\nsuch a close friend of mine. Then, from there, I \u2014 I was \u2014 I was sent toa\u2014toa\u2014toa\ntraining camp, and in about six weeks they send me to the first mission. I mean, I\nwas recruited, got the uniform, got my \u2014 they sent me within Lithuania, in certain\nplaces to \u2014 to be attached to the \u2014 there was also \u2014 you see, there was also a\nLithuanian brigade under the Commander Vilinski(ph), who was \u2014 which was\nformed right when the war \u2014 in the beginning of the war. Very brave. Many of those\npeople died in \u2014 in deep Russia, you know, and it was incredible, really. But I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I joined the regular ar-army, which I \u2014 I said that is a policing force, which\nis called the \u2014 it was the 33rd regiment of the [indecipherable] NK VD, which was\nthe border police, attached to the NK VD. After the training and after they send me\nto Lithuania, they send me to a place, to Liepaja, which was Courland, in \u2014 that\nwas in Latvia. And there \u2014 there we had big \u2014 a big fight because there were \u2014 there\nwere the \u2014 I don't know whether you heard about the Vlasovtsy. That is a General\nVlasov, a Ukrainian who joined the Germans and he created a Ukrainian \u2014\nUkrainian battalion. Alway \u2014 almost the army, who fought with the Germans\nagainst the Russians, against their own people. So there were entrenched the \u2014 a\ngroup of \u2014 of those people, and they fought tooth and nail because they knew that if\nthey are going to be captured, they are going to be killed [indecipherable]. They\n111\nSeptember 22, 1994\nwouldn't take them as prisoners. And there I had my \u2014 my first accident. I was in a\nJeep with a \u2014 with a captain, and \u2014 and a driver, and there was a big shelling, and it\nhit the Jeep, and I was just knocked out fro-from the Jeep, and I found myself later\nin the hospital. Thanks God I had only two broken ribs and \u2014 and small \u2014 small\ncontusions and some \u2014 some other things, you know. But the captain who was\nsitting next to me was killed, a Russian captain. And then from there, I \u2014 they sent\nme after I \u2014 took me about 14, 15 days to \u2014 to be back on my feet \u2014 they \u2014 they send\nme to Germany, was to ca \u2014 and participate in \u2014 in liberating the City of\nKonigsburg, which was very interesting. And from there, they came a order to \u2014\nafter a while, came an order \u2014 a special order, that our regiment was going to be\nsent entirely to the [indecipherable] Islands, to the Japanese front. And I was the\nonly one that got the assignment to join Chuikov\u2019s army in the direction of Berlin.\nAnd this was \u2014 and I feel that this was because the \u2014 the colonel that was in charge,\nVenakurov(ph), I think it was, Jewish. And I \u2014 I told him once, I said, look \u2014 I\npleaded with him, I told him, look, I\u20141if you are going to send me to the\n[indecipherable] Islands, I am going to be of no use, and I am in the mood, you\nknow, to \u2014 to take vengeance for \u2014 for my people, and I \u2014 I think my place wil \u2014\nshould be on the German front rather than on the \u2014 on the Japanese front. So next\nday, I \u2014 I found a \u2014 a \u2014 it\u2019s called kommandi(ph) rofka(ph). That means my\n112September 22, 1994\nassignment to travel. And this is when I traveled through Warsaw. I remember\ntraveling through Warsaw bridge, it took us maybe an hour to pass this bridge,\nbecause the bridge was completely damaged and the train was going slowly through\nthat. And then there I joined the \u2014 I joined Chuikow\u2019s forces. And this was\nincredible experience, incredible experience. Then we marched, I mean we went \u2014\nwhen we \u2014 we continued to Berlin and we also liberated a concentration camp of\nSachsenhausen. And we had in our \u2014 in our power, most of the \u2014 of the guards\nfrom the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen. Now the \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you saw when you got to Sachsenhausen.",
        "A: What we saw was \u2014 was \u2014 was terrible, terrible things. I mean the \u2014 the face of\nthe \u2014 there were few people \u2014 I mean, not too many people. I would say a few\nhundred people. Maybe it were \u2014 maybe more than that, maybe around thousand\npeople that were \u2014 were liberated. Most of them we found many, many, ravines\nwith \u2014 with human bodies, you know, skeletons. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was a\nterrible, a terrible, terrible view, you know, to see that, see what actually \u2014 there\nwere \u2014 and this \u2014 in Sachsenhausen, there were not only Jews, there were also\nmany, many from other different nationalities. There were Russian prisoners, there\nwere \u2014 there were Polaks, and there were some not \u2014 non-Jewish people also. We\nhave \u2014 we were successful because they \u2014 they actually \u2014 they wanted to \u2014 the \u2014 theSeptember 22, 1994\nguards actually threw away their weapons, and they wanted to \u2014 they \u2014 they actually\nsurrendered. The \u2014 the fight was \u2014 it was not a big fight because they \u2014 they felt that\n\u2014 that it\u2019s over and although there were SS, they were pure SS. They were not the\nWehrmacht. And they were all apprehended, most of them. The \u2014 the head of the\ncamp, I mean, the \u2014 the commander of the camp and \u2014 and the \u2014 the more important\npeople were \u2014 they \u2014 they escaped. We would spend there a short time. There was\nalso a very big stench, you know, because there was \u2014 this camp was \u2014 was dev-\ndevastated, you know. They have committed so many atrocities, apparently they\nwanted to move the people, to move out \u2014 to move out a little bit further, because,\nyou know, Sachsenhausen is not far from Berlin. It's like 50 kilometers from\nBerlin. They \u2014",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to change the tape? No.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they have decided, and it was a\u2014 a captain that was \u2014 dec-decided that\nthey, rather than \u2014 they rather surrender than \u2014 than \u2014 than keep up fighting. The \u2014\nthe people were \u2014 I mean, they were like, stunned when we came in. They \u2014 they \u2014\nthey didn't know. They \u2014 they thought we were angels. We were \u2014 we were \u2014 we\ncame down from heaven, you know. They \u2014 they \u2014 they have never, never believed\nthat they are going to be able to survive, you know, because they \u2014 because they\nwere \u2014 that was a German camp. It was not \u2014 there are many Germans, also,\n114\nSeptember 22, 1994\nGerman Jews. It was a swift liberation on this \u2014 this camp was remarkable. And\nthen, through the guards, we found out many, many, many details in their \u2014 I mean,\nin \u2014 in questioning them. We brought them to \u2014 those people, we brought them to\nour \u2014 to our headquarters.",
        "Q: Now I know we have to change \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Seven\n115September 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: \u2014 everything what they have left behind them. So they \u2014 I remember that, yeah.\nThat is the \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] and that\u2019s when they [indecipherable] that miraculous escape.\nA number of people actually \u2014 you \u2014 you were talking about this earlier, weren\u2019t\nyou?",
        "A: About the escape from \u2014",
        "Q: From the Ninth Fort. And one other question; were you \u2014 when you went back\nto Kovno, were you with the Red Army at that point?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you were part of the Red Army that liberated Kovno.",
        "A: I was not part of the army. I was with the army, but I was still not \u2014 I was still\nnot a\u2014a soldier. I was still \u2014",
        "Q: But you went in when they liberated Kovno?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I\u2014I-",
        "Q: Pll let you finish where you were before.",
        "A: Yeah, so Sachsenhausen, we had \u2014 we were successful in \u2014\n116September 22, 1994",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry [indecipherable] lean back.",
        "A: Yeah, we were successful and \u2014 in getting most of the guards with us. Of course,\nI wouldn\u2019t say all of them, but most. And we held them in [indecipherable] which\nwas east \u2014 in east Berlin, in ern(ph) Schnellstrasse, for the purposes of a\ninvestigation. At that time, the colonel that was the head of my superior officer, he\nwanted to make a small process, similar to the Nuremberg process. And that was\none of the reasons why we went twice to Nuremberg, before consultations. But\nthen I \u2014 truthfully, I don\u2019t know what happened afterwards, you know, because he\nwas called to \u2014 he was called to Moscow, to meet with Molotov, for a certain \u2014 for\n\u2014 for certain reasons, and fortunately for me, I \u2014 I was not able to see him when he\ncame back, because I was not in the Russian army any more when \u2014 when he came\nback. Now, during the investigations, we have \u2014 we have had \u2014 very spontaneously\nthey \u2014 the guards have cooperated. They gave us many details, and they gave us as\nmuch information as they \u2014 as they were able to. And there was a case within this\ninvestigation, where we had a lieutenant that broke down, because the investigation,\nwe used to \u2014 the \u2014 we used to conduct them between one and four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. And this was \u2014 precisely this was done in this fashion, because that was\nthe \u2014 the way the \u2014 the KGB, and the NKVD used to \u2014 used to conduct themselves,\nbecause they feel that in this they\u2019re under \u2014 under \u2014 under \u2014 in \u2014 in a silent\n117September 22, 1994\nambience, and with \u2014 with \u2014 with some heavy lights focused on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on\nthe prisoner, and the heavy questioning, they \u2014 they had no choice but they had to \u2014\nto spill out all the information that they had. So we had this case with the lieutenant\nwho \u2014 who broke down, and he jumped through \u2014 broke the window, jumped down\nand \u2014 and fell on top of a picket fence. And we thought that he \u2014 he wanted to\ncommit suicide, you know, but fortunately for him, he \u2014 he survived, and he was\nable then later to complete \u2014 complete the investigation and give us the additional\ninformation that we were looking for. I mean, especially so longer it was, we were\npreparing for a process, we needed more exact information about th-the conditions,\nand about the brutalities they have committed, and their approach to the \u2014 to the\nprisoners with their \u2014 their food rationing, their \u2014 their \u2014 the \u2014 the composition of\nthe \u2014 of the people in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the camp, and the \u2014 and so many\ndetails that were \u2014 everything were \u2014 we had \u2014 everything was written down, and \u2014\nand ready, almost, for a \u2014 for a process.",
        "Q: Okay, you were \u2014 you went to Berlin. You were part of the li \u2014 the liberating\nforce of Berlin, were you not?",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we \u2014 we were part of the liber \u2014 became about SS \u2014 as you know, the\nBerlin was the last stronghold of Hitler and his \u2014 and his followers. He, of course,\nwent with her, and now he \u2014 I mean the \u2014 he\u2019s so ready that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s over, it\u2019s\n118September 22, 1994\nfinished. The 1,000 year Reich is coming to the end. And he gathered, of course, his\nmain advisors, and they \u2014 they have apparently decided to \u2014 to throw the last \u2014 the\nlast kampf. Not mein kampf, but the last kampf, the last battle, to see \u2014 they \u2014\nthey wanted \u2014 they were very much disappointed to fell into the ru \u2014 in the Russian\nhands. They felt much more comfortable if they would have fallen into the French,\nBritish, or American \u2014 they \u2014 their desire was to \u2014 to be in the American hands, but\nunfortunately for them, and fortunately \u2014 and unfortunately for some Russians also\n\u2014as you know, Eisenhower stopped to the Elbe, and he gave orders just to stop\nthere, not to go ahead. It was a tactical \u2014 I \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a\u2014 a good decision in\none way, and a bad decision in a si \u2014 1n the other way, because this what prompted\nfor what happened afterwards, because Berlin was taken by the Russians. The\nRussians were very happy, because to them, you see, the Americans, they are more\ngeared for \u2014 for individuals. The Russians are more geared for masses. The ind-\nindividuals don\u2019t count, you know, and they didn\u2019t count in the Soviet Union. So\nthey fell to \u2014 to sacrifice 50,000 more of troops couldn\u2019t make a difference, you\nknow. Eisenhower thought in different terms. He thought, let the Russians take it.\nWhy should we sacrifice our people? And \u2014 and this was \u2014 it was a smart decision,\nas I mentioned, in the sense that not \u2014 not to sacrifice more \u2014 more G.Ls.",
        "Q: Right. So you went in.September 22, 1994",
        "A: But \u2014 yeah, so we went in, and th-there \u2014 Berlin was taken, as you know, by the\nshtrafniki. There were a few battalions of th \u2014 of \u2014 of prisoners, and deserters, and\nthey were given a opportunity to get in the fight of Berlin, and get amnesty for the\nlife \u2014 I mean, if they \u2014 if they survive. And this was a tremendous battle, you know,\nbecause Hitler threw all the \u2014 all his reserves, and all those who were faithful to\nhim, especially a \u2014 a big force of Hitlerjugend. That was the \u2014 the young Hitler\narmy. The battle was over pretty soon. The \u2014 the resistance was not as strong as the\nRussians had thought it\u2019s going to be, and the city fell. The Russians have\nconcentrated the east \u2014 east side of Berlin, and we have \u2014 we \u2014 we were assigned \u2014\nwe were coming in, we were assigned to go to the Reichs Chancellery, which was\nthe \u2014 which was the hideout of Hitler, and his followers, his closest followers. We\nhave found the Reichs Chancellery with a\u2014 with a bomb, which penetrated\nthrough the roof, and have never exploded. And the inside, it was almost everything\nin \u2014 in pretty \u2014 pretty good condition, except for the \u2014 for the big hole that opened\nup from a \u2014 now, we found also the \u2014 the bunker of Hitler, which was incredible,\nincredible art work, in the sense of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of security, providing security for \u2014\nfor a tyrant like \u2014 like Hitler and his \u2014 his people. We found doors, steel doors,\nwhich like three foot of thickness of the door. We found the \u2014 the \u2014 from beton \u2014\nfrom \u2014 from concrete, about 10 foot of concrete thickness, you know, walls, and \u2014\n120September 22, 1994\nand to the point where we found quite a lot of documents. And basically we had the\norders, and we found also traces of Eva Braun and Hitler, which we feel that this\nwas their \u2014 th-their \u2014 their ashes. That was never confirmed, because the Russians\nhave not \u2014 were not interested in, for some reason, to publicize that, and they have\ncleaned out the place, as soon after we found that. But most of the documents, in the\ndocumentary, we have turned over to the \u2014 to the Americans, who used to come\nwith Studebakers, and take them away, because for some \u2014 some \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u2014 they was [indecipherable] from their archives. What kind of documents, I\nreally don\u2019t know, because I \u2014 I myself have not had a \u2014 a chance to \u2014 had we\nknown that there were valuable documents, because they were \u2014 they were in the ru\n\u2014 the fact that they were in the Reichs Chancellery, and the fact that they were in\nwell \u2014 well-guarded, and well preserved, was that \u2014 that they are \u2014 they had \u2014 and\nI\u2019m sure that there were \u2014 they\u2019re somewhere stashed away, or they\u2019re now still in \u2014\nin \u2014 in separate places in \u2014 in United States. Because based what Officer\nSchwartz(ph) told me \u2014 not officer, he was a sergeant, whom I met and who was\nthe one that used to come with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the trucks, and we used to help\nthe \u2014 our soldiers used to help to pack them. Now, right after that, we \u2014",
        "Q: One \u2014 one more question. Where did you find these ashes, the re \u2014 the supposed\n121September 22, 1994\nremains \u2014",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were in the \u2014 in the courtyard. Was a big courtyard\nsurrounding the Reichs Chancellery, and there was a big fence around that. And\nwe found that in \u2014 in \u2014 in one spot, it was like \u2014 it was not on the ground, it was on\n\u2014 on -\u2014 on top of the ground.",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 who told you that that\u2019s what it was?",
        "A: We found out about that. I mean, it\u2019s a \u2014 we were \u2014 it\u2019s presumably that they \u2014\nthey were the ashes from \u2014 from Hitler.",
        "Q: Just a pile of ashes?",
        "A: Because for some \u2014 pile of ashes, you know, and there were some \u2014 also some\ntraces of bones, and some other things. We knew they\u2019re human \u2014 they\u2019re human\nrem \u2014 remains, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 of course, we didn\u2019t know that \u2014 but then later we\nfound out that this \u2014 this was \u2014 and it came to \u2014 we came to the conclusion.\nAlthough, the Russians felt that they \u2014 I had a \u2014 nobody knows their reasonings.\nRather than come out publicly \u2014 publicly and say look, why don\u2019t we find it, they\nreally didn\u2019t \u2014 were not very much interested in the details. They felt that \u2014 for\nsome reason they have a \u2014 they had a different attitude. They would rather \u2014 rather\nthan start researching documents, they would rather send people to \u2014 to the gulag.\nSend Nazis to the gulag, imprison them. Have a short trial without any \u2014 any \u2014September 22, 1994\nwithout any benefits for those \u2014 for the prisoners, and \u2014 and just tr-transport them.\nThat was their aim, they were so fed up and \u2014 and so bitter, that they \u2014 they \u2014 the \u2014\nthe Germans, for them, were like \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 they \u2014 they just were not able to\nstand them at all, you know. And th-then there\u2019s \u2014 and there\u2019s \u2014 we understand the\nreason for that, you know. So, right there in [indecipherable] we \u2014 we were living\n[indecipherable] in the compound, in there, where our main offices were. Then\nfrom \u2014 next to us was a\u2014 a\u2014 was a Store from a \u2014 a place where some German Jews\nhad a\u2014 there were furs. They had \u2014 they \u2014 they made furs. And I\u2019ve befriended\nthem. The name was Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and his brother, and then his wife. He\nmarried a \u2014 a German woman, whose husband \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve got an audio problem. [break] I \u2014 I just want to\nunderstand one thing. When you were with the Russian army, you served primarily\nas an interpreter?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 you didn\u2019t do shooting or anything?",
        "A: No, in this \u2014 in this case, oh yes, in the beginning, yes, of course. That was \u2014 we\n\u2014 we did \u2014 we did that, we did shooting, you know.",
        "Q: You?",
        "A: Of course, yeah. We did. But \u2014 [interruption] Especially in Lithuania, when\n123September 22, 1994\nwe were in Lithuania, we \u2014 the main \u2014 main work was persecution of \u2014 of\ncriminals, and \u2014 [interruption] In \u2014 in Berlin, I did more in \u2014 more \u2014 more work as\ninterpreter, because I was mostly assigned to this \u2014 to the coroner, whereby when I\nwas in Lithuania, I didn\u2019t have a \u2014 a special assignee \u2014 assignment, you know, I\nwas mostly as \u2014 we moved, especially when we took [indecipherable], I mean, I\nwas in the \u2014 in \u2014 it was part of the \u2014 of the training, but it was not the training, it\nwas already in the battlefield.",
        "Q: So do you \u2014 you were starting to tell me that you met this \u2014",
        "A: So, I met Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and I befriended him, and I explained to him\nthat I have relatives in Cuba. We became very friendly, and I used to go to his\nhouse, and beside that, I \u2014 I was very close to \u2014 to the [indecipherable] Baruck(ph)\nwas his name. He was a Ukrainian, and he \u2014 he was a colonel. And I used to ha \u2014 I\nhad with him a very good relationship. He had all his family with him in Berlin.\nAnd like most of the Russians, he was interested in \u2014 in some material help, you\nknow. So we \u2014 what we used to \u2014 my assignment was to bring in \u2014 our assignment\nwas to bring in some people from the \u2014 from the \u2014 that used to belong to the Nazi\nparty, or that used to be involved some way in the \u2014 in \u2014 in some criminal activities\nor something. And \u2014 and we used to get him as \u2014 as informers. So we have them on\nour list, we had a \u2014 one of the informers was a \u2014 had a gramophone factory. They\u2019re\n124September 22, 1994\nthe one who had the slaughterhouse. One has a \u2014 like a other type of factory, I don\u2019t\nremember what was. So what \u2014 I used to have a motorcycle, with a side one. So\nthose people were redeemed in a certain way. There was al-always the sword of\nDamocles was hanging over their \u2014 over their neck, you know. But they were, in a\ncertain way, so long they were able to form, and to give all the information about\nsome more bigger fish, you know. So once a week we used to \u2014 they used to come\nto our compou \u2014 to our compound \u2014 I mean \u2014 and they used to meet with the \u2014 with\nthe \u2014 used to come very discreetly. We had a special entrance for them. And they\nused to give all \u2014 all kind of information, you know. So, when I used to \u2014 I used to\ngo to meet them from time to time, to visit them, they used to fill up my side, you\nknow, from the motorcycle, like with all kind of meats, and everything, and they\nused to take that \u2014 there used to be Alexanderplatz(ph), which was a \u2014 a \u2014 a place,\na very special place for black market, and \u2014 and for all kind of illegal activities, you\nknow. Used to take that over there, and they used to sell it, and then bring the\nmoney to \u2014 to \u2014 to the commander, and you know, to the \u2014 and turned it over to\nhim. He used to give me something like a [indecipherable] and I was very, very\nhappy, you know. And then, when I used to go with the gramophone factory, used\nto be loaded with gramophones, you know. They \u2014 the Germans, I mean they \u2014 they\nhad a\u2014a very interesting thing, it\u2019s when they \u2014 when \u2014 when they capitulated, I\n125September 22, 1994\nmean, that was it. They wouldn\u2019t get involved in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in terrorist or some\nother activities, that was it. In the meantime, I used to go with \u2014 with Colonel\nBaruck(ph). He \u2014 he was very friendly with the chief of police from \u2014 from Berlin,\nand they used to go hunting together, and I was with them, always. So one day, I \u2014 I\nbecame friendly also with the chief of police, and I told him I \u2014I say, I\u2019m involved\nin \u2014 in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one sector \u2014 now\nthat Berlin is divided four sector; the French, the British, the Russian, and the \u2014 and\nthe American. I says, and I am sometimes in jeopardy, so I need a \u2014 a ausweis \u2014 I \u2014\na card, as a German. He hesitated, but then he gave it to me, you know. And I say,\ndon\u2019t mention it to anybody, because this is due to my work, you know. So, when I\nmet with Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and I disclosed him that I eventually want to \u2014 I\nhave relatives in Cuba, and I\u2019d like to get out, because pretty soon they\u2019re going to\ndemobilize me and send me back to Lithuania, which was \u2014 I didn\u2019t have any\ndesire to go back to Lithuania. So we start actively pursuing, I mean, how to \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 what to do, how to \u2014 so one day he comes for \u2014 to me, very happy,\nand he says, listen, I mean, there is a Joint \u2014 the Joint Distribution Center in \u2014 in\nWest Berlin, in the American sector. Why don\u2019t we go over there? And I used to\nwear sometimes, civilian clothes also, because due to my work, I mean, I used to\nhave to be camouflaged, you know, so I wore more civilian than \u2014 than military. So\n126September 22, 1994\nI say, okay, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s move. So, we took the U-Bahn, you know, the metro? And\nwe went to \u2014 I think it was in \u2014 in Charlottenburg. So, we came into the Joint\nDistribution, and there is a American colonel, and I say, look, I\u2019m a\u2014 a Russian and\nJewish officer in the Russian army, and I would like to \u2014 you should help me to\nflee, and I \u2014 I have my relatives in Cuba, and I \u2014 I just would like to get away,\nbecause \u2014 I explained to him, I say, I\u2019m going to be very openly where you \u2014 open\nwith you, I am truthfully \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 they \u2014 I have no use any more to be\nhere. I mean, I have already accomplished what I felt to accomplish. Now I will \u2014\nwhat I want is to \u2014 to \u2014 to get to my family, I mean, because I am by myself.\nThey\u2019re going to send me back to \u2014 he said, look, we\u2019re sorry, but we cannot do\nanything, because we have a very good relationship with the Russian, they\u2019re our\nallies, and we cannot create a \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a international conflict. I say, international\n[indecipherable]. So I almost [indecipherable] because I saw here that my \u2014 my\nopportunity to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to get out, and I thought, they\u2019re going to \u2014 like, I\u2019m going\nto declare myself like a \u2014 a\u2014a refugee, and then that\u2019s it. So he says \u2014 he calls on\nhis secretary. He said, look, you know where your relatives are in Cuba, what\u2019s\ntheir name? And I say, yes, I have their name. Do you \u2014 do you know where they\nare? I say, no, they\u2019re in Havana. Do you have a address? I give to her address. So I\nsay, why don\u2019t you send \u2014 we are going to send a telegram. We\u2019re going to sendSeptember 22, 1994\nthat to the Jewish community center in Havana, to make the story short. And I\nthought, I mean, this 1s a\u2014 I mean, he just wanted to get rid of me, and then he \u2014 he\n\u2014 he just [indecipherable]. Exactly 20 days later, Helmut(ph) calls me and says,\nhey. He says, I have a letter from Cuba for you. A month later, and I almost fainted,\nyou know. I had my, in Yiddish [indecipherable] letter from my uncle, telling me\nthat my other uncle, you know, that I left, and he was in the concentration camp in\nBuchenwald was liberated. His wife was liberated, and they tried to locate the\ndaughter. And that my friend, this Prather(ph), that he was together with me in \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 in the camps, and I helped him, is in Munich, and he\u2019s studying engineering,\nand they\u2019re going to get in touch with him to \u2014 he should help me escape. And\npretty soon I received another letter, from Munich, from \u2014 and this letters wer \u2014\nwent to Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), not to me, of course, because I had to be very \u2014\nvery much \u2014 very much careful, because any \u2014 any step on the side, I would have\nbeen completely \u2014 I mean, they would send me to Siberia. Not even that, they\nwould shoot me. There would be a court martial. So \u2014 can we interrupt for a\nminute?",
        "Q: Yes. [break]",
        "A: So I received \u2014 I received a letter from Louie\u2019s brother, who was in Munich,\nschool of \u2014 engineering school, and beautiful letter from him, that he\u2019s going to trySeptember 22, 1994\nto do everything possible, that he received, he received a \u2014 a \u2014 a letter from Cuba,\nfrom my uncles. And incidentally, my \u2014 my letter [indecipherable] mine \u2014 my\nletter went to Cuba. I mean, not my letter, their \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014 their telegram that\nthey sent from the \u2014 from the Joint Distribution Center, they send it to the \u2014 to the\nJewish Community Center. My uncle was the president at that time, from the\ncommunity center. He was the one that brought most of the family, brought the\nother uncle, and everything. So Prather(ph) told me in his letter \u2014 I mean, he\nmentioned that he 1s going to \u2014 that he has a \u2014 a hunch that \u2014 that he has already\nsomebody that \u2014 that will be able \u2014 be in \u2014 that\u2019s going to be helpful in my \u2014 in my\ndefection from the Russian army. That time, I remember it was already \u2014 it was\nPassover. And Helmut(ph), I mean the contact was Helmut(ph) all the time.\nHelmut(ph) calls me again and says there is \u2014 there is some people that came from\n[indecipherable] a husband and wife and a child. Three people. And they want to\nmeet with me. So I made sure that nobody\u2019s following me, and I met with them.\nAnd this was a guy that was a\u2014 a smuggler. He used to smuggle from the \u2014 from\nthe American \u2014 from the Russian zone, certain items to the American zone, and\nfrom the American zone to the Russian zone. So he approached me, told me that he\nis \u2014 that Prather(ph) sent him, and that he understand that I want to be helped to\ncross the border in a certain place, which he \u2014 he knows very well, he says. And he\n129September 22, 1994\ntravels always with his wife and child, because that makes \u2014 doesn\u2019t gi \u2014 doesn\u2019t\nmake him too \u2014 those \u2014 the people, and the guards to be suspicious. He didn\u2019t know\nthat I am \u2014 I am in \u2014 in the Russian army, and Prather(ph) cautioned me against\nthat, he said, don\u2019t tell him that you are in the army, because then he is not going to\ndo that, and then he is not going to help you. So I told him, look, I\u2019m also in the\nsmuggling business, and I do this and this and that, and I have \u2014 have certain\ncontacts which I want to see in the \u2014 in American zone, and this and that. So we\narranged this. I went to the \u2014 I left him behind, I went to the bahnhof, to the train\nstation, and there were a huge amount of people. I went in uniform, and I bought\nfour tickets, to go like to \u2014 1n the direction of Bremen, with the train. Then I \u2014 I\ntook my motorcycle, and I took it to a safe place, and I called a guy, and say okay,\nwe have the tickets. When do we go? He say, we have to go immediately. Says,\nthere is no time to \u2014 to waste. I get myself \u2014",
        "Q: Can you hear him pretty well? He\u2019s talking so quietly?\nQ2: Yeah, I \u2014 that\u2019s fine. Sorry to interrupt.",
        "A: I have a \u2014 first of all, I calmed down for a minute, and I was very excited,\nbecause that was a\u2014 a-\u2014a incredible step to take, you know, because to \u2014 to go out\n\u2014 it\u2019s not to leave Berlin, because you see, Berlin ha \u2014 was in four sectors. But\nBerlin by itself, found itself within the Russian occupational zone, which meansSeptember 22, 1994\nthat in order to get out from Berlin is not to get out of Berlin, I had to get out from\nthe whole zone, to cross through hundred \u2014 few hundred kilometers. And this is not\n\u2014 it\u2019s not easy, because although at that time, in 1947 \u2014 that was already 1947, in\nthat time there was still not \u2014 there was still not as tight as it became tighter later. So\nI \u2014I figured out, what shall I do? So I had a little, small caliber pistol, which I took\naway from my German officer, still in \u2014 in K6nigsburg \u2014 with \u2014 the handles were\nmade from elephant bone. Beautiful, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it was something remarkable.\nAnd I had a bunch of \u2014 first of all, in the \u2014 in the army, the Russian army I was paid\nas a officer, I received a certain amount of money in Russian rubles, and then a\ndouble amount in German occupational marks. I had money, I had more than what I\ncan \u2014 was able to use. And incidentally, I used to send \u2014 every month I was able to\nsend two packages, and I used to send to my relatives in \u2014 in \u2014 in Kovno, his\nfamily. Every \u2014 every month I send them two big packages, with all kind of\ngoodies. So then I had my \u2014\nEnd of Tape EightSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: I'll let you finish \u2014",
        "A: Right. Let me finish \u2014 let me finish this part, which is \u2014 I will tell you something.\nOne day, I will talk to Spielberg, you know, one day we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll make a very\nprofitable film for him. So \u2014 so I had my German ausweis, which I got from the\nchief of police when we were out hunting. I had my \u2014 my Russian ausweis. I had\nmoney, rubles, money in German occupational marks, and I have a little caliber\npistol. And the little caliber was \u2014 was \u2014 and you will not believe for what. Not to\nshoot anybody, but to shoot myself if \u2014 if \u2014 if they would \u2014 if they would catch me\nbecause there\u2019s no question in my mind, th-they would \u2014 they would have done this\nwithout any reproach, you know. So \u2014 and then we moved to the \u2014 moved to the\ntrain, and I figured already everything out. I figured we have a long voyage to a\nsmall town which is going the direction to Bremen, but Bremen is in the eng \u2014 in\nthe British Zone of occupation. But I felt that \u2014 I figured out, I said, I know that this\ntrain is going to be searched. There is going to be a \u2014 some type of guard is going to\ncome in at some certain point to check the documenta \u2014 documents on the train.\nBecause that was a normal procedure and I \u2014 I knew it\u2019s going to happen. I also \u2014 I\nthought to myself, it\u2019s going to come in a German guard, I\u2019m going to show them\nthat I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives. And I didn\u2019t have aSeptember 22, 1994\nproblem because I \u2014 I had also this Baruck(ph), my colonel, was out of town. He\nwas in \u2014 in Moscow for a conference, and I had the right to \u2014 to \u2014 to travel to a\ncertain \u2014 certain distance, because I need \u2014 I needed a special permit, which I didn\u2019t\nhave. But I could \u2014 I could justify my trip, you know, because I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t\ncarry with me any \u2014 any \u2014 any belongings or anything, it\u2019s just only a small thing.\nThen I said, if it comes a Russian, I\u2019m going to identify myself as a German. What\ncan I do? Okay. We \u2014 we travel. The train was crowded. I mean, so crowded it was\nthat \u2014 were unable to turn. Suddenly, we come to a certain point, there\u2019s soldiers.\nRussian and Germans together. I say, that\u2019s my day. That\u2019s my day, what shall I do?\nAnd I had to think quickly. I was next to the guy with the \u2014 with his wife, and we\nwere chatting and \u2014 and here comes the guard, documents, documents, documents. I\nventured to pull out my German rather than Russian, and I think I made the right\ndecision, you know. In the middle of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of looking at my \u2014 checking my\ndocument, the child starts crying. And some way that tension was deflected, and I\nwas da \u2014 I \u2014 I think it was a sheer \u2014 sheer luck for me, you know. And they just only\nask me where I travel, and I said \u2014 I knew right town and [indecipherable]. So why\ndo you come [indecipherable]. And I said a few words in German, you know, and\n\u2014 and my worries were over. They came to the \u2014 almost to the border. We come off.\nThen he said to me, no, we have to go now. We have to walk now for about two\n133September 22, 1994\nkilometers, because there is a place where I will always go through, but there is a\nvery little where \u2014 sometimes even \u2014 they don't have even a guard on the border.\nBecause you see, it\u2019s not a natural border, now where they \u2014 which they had \u2014 when\nthey made later, in the later years, like when they \u2014 when they had the air supply,\nBerlin, and th-that was much more difficult to escape now. But in 1947, was still \u2014\nyou know, it was still at a point where the war was still \u2014 I mean, they were still not\n\u2014 not so organized now. And I remember when we crossed \u2014 I mean, there \u2014 we\nheard some shots on the other side [indecipherable] but it was not relevant. We\ncrossed and there were \u2014 not the last, there were quite a few people who \u2014 who\ncrossed. Apparently, this was the place where we crossed the border. And there was\na big sign that said, you are entering the British Zone of occupation. If you have\nsome armaments, or some illegal \u2014 illegal items, the kommandantur is here, here,\nand here. You have to immediate identify yourself and deliver that to the\nkommandantur. | kissed the ground when I found myself in this. And then I \u2014 I\npulled out, the first thing, I-I threw my pistol and I said, the hell with that, I was\ngoing to throw \u2014 this guy grabs me by the hand, he says, what is that? I didn\u2019t know\nyou were armed, he said to me. I said, why not? And he said, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s completely\nprohibited. You cannot have arms. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s against \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s\nagainst the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the terms, you know. So who are you? What ha \u2014 you\n134September 22, 1994\nare not a smuggler like you told me. I said, no, no, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but I\u2019m a\nRussian officer. He says, you\u2019re crazy. How come you didn't tell me? I say, because\nI didn't feel it was irrel \u2014 relevant to tell you. He said, give me, give me. Let me see\nthe pistol. I said \u2014 he say [indecipherable], took it, he says, you know what, I\u2019m\ngoing to bury that right here. When I come back, I\u2019Il take it. It\u2019s worth \u2014 it\u2019s worth\n500 dollars, he say, that\u2019s \u2014 this is so beautiful. This \u2014 this is real \u2014 real elephant\nbone handle. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s worth a fortune. I said, you can have it. You need\nsome marks? I told him, you have here marks also, because they are useless here.\nBecause I had \u2014 I had the Russian occupation \u2014 I mean, the German occupational\nmarks, which belong to the \u2014 on the Russian border \u2014 on the \u2014 the \u2014 the Russian\nzone, not the \u2014 the \u2014 the British and the American zone had different \u2014 different\nmarks, you know. So I gave it to him and then we went to \u2014 from there we went to\nBremen. In Bremen, we slept in the \u2014 1n the railroad station. I red \u2014 I had my\nknapsack and my \u2014 my boots were my \u2014 my pillow. I was so happy. From there I\nhad to go to Bergen-Belsen, which was in the vicinity, because there I had my\ncontact. So I went to Bergen-Belsen, spend there a night. And then I found the man\nthat\u2019s supposed to take me back to \u2014 take me to Munich. And then I came to\nMunich, my friend was ecstatic. He had a little, tiny-miney room, you know, big as\nmy closet here. And he says, we can share it, I mean, you can stay here. And for the\n135September 22, 1994\nfirst time, I had a good meal, you know. Fantastic, you know, say \u2014 with some\nAmerican products, and some other thing. I forgot to mention to you that when we\nwere in the \u2014 in Berlin, I had to mention to you something very important, that I \u2014 I\noverlooked something. Being in Berlin, we had a \u2014 I had a special mission. I don't\nknow how many people are aware, but I-I don't think too many are aware of that.\nI\u2019m going to tell you that they \u2014 they have transplanted factories from Berlin to\nsome \u2014 they \u2014 they used to take them to different parts of Russia. So I was assigned\na mission with a truck with three soldiers to go to \u2014 they have \u2014 taking out the IG\nFarben company from Berlin, and they are supposed to be shipped to Leningrad\nto dismantle completely. Not only dismantle, what they have \u2014 our assignment was\nto take the workers, including even the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the lowest paid guy, like, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the guy that cleans the factory. Everybody had to be placed on a train by five\no\u2019clock in the morning. And we used to come with a truck and come to the house\nand knock on the door and say, out in five minutes. Sei haben five minuten. So\nyou have five minutes to \u2014 to get your belongings and \u2014 and out on the car. This\nwas such a pleasure, this task that I had. Of course, it was nothing compared to what\nthey have done to me. But it was, I \u2014 I cer \u2014I found a certain \u2014 although, I didn\u2019t\nhave anything against the \u2014 against the guys, those guys that worked there in the\nfactory, no. Now, this \u2014 this factory, for a fact, they were so organized \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014September 22, 1994\nthe Russians were so organi \u2014 disorganized, that it took them X amount of months\nto reach the destiny for the factory. And then they found out that part of the factory\nwent to one place, to Smolensk and the other one went to Leningrad. And tha-that\nwas the what \u2014 what the \u2014 but if that \u2014 what th \u2014 I had to mention that, because that\nwas a very, very unique experience, you know, whereby I \u2014 I was in charge of \u2014 of\ntaking \u2014 I mean, to \u2014 disassembling and taking those people to the train station at\nfive o\u2019clock, and \u2014 and it \u2014 1t was a\u2014 a remarkable \u2014 you know, sometimes you\nremember certain \u2014 certain \u2014 so okay, so wh-when I came \u2014 when I came to\nMunich, I \u2014 it happened to be those people that I used to send packages. Those\nrelatives were in Feldafing.",
        "Q: They were in Munich?",
        "A: Next to Munich was small DP camps. One was Landsberg, and the other was \u2014\nwas Feldafing. They were in Feldafing. So I stayed couple days in Prather\u2019s\nhome, and then he took me to Feldafing, because they are \u2014 they\u2019re relatives. And\nthis lady, Fruma(ph) Lankavich(ph), she went out her way to accommodate me\nand to \u2014 and to \u2014 and to help me out. And what \u2014 what I wanted basically is to \u2014 to\nget \u2014 get out from Germany and go to \u2014 to Cuba. So there was \u2014 I asked her \u2014 from\nthere, I wrote already freely, you know, to \u2014 to Cuba, and they \u2014 they send me\nsome \u2014 they send me letters, and they send me also a letter saying that they have \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nthey instituted a visa in \u2014 in \u2014 in fr \u2014 in Paris, to go to \u2014 I mean to \u2014 in order to\ncome to Cuba. Now, how do you go to Paris? I don\u2019t have any \u2014 any \u2014 any\ndocuments. So I start working on documents. In the meantime, a guy came by and\nhe said that he is \u2014 he\u2019s capable to \u2014 you know, we\u2019re very desperate, you know.\nThe time was now important to \u2014 to get out. I mean, we just wanted to reach already\na destiny, after so many pain and suffering. So we had \u2014 the guy said that for a\nhundred dollars, he is going to make me false papers to travel to France. So I \u2014 I\nfound a\u2014 a-\u2014a friend of \u2014 of the family, with the name of Bernard Picard(ph),\nwho also in Kovno ghetto. And he was a brigadier, the other brigade, Bernard\nPicard(ph). And he le \u2014 he lend me the \u2014 the hundred dollars. And I gave it to the\nguy and he made me this paper, it didn\u2019t look to me good, but I figured he \u2014 he \u2014 he\nknows what he\u2019s doing. But through the train, we went to Strasbourg, and through\nSaargebiet, you know. And when we came to France, the Saret\u00e9 came out, the\nFrench police took us off an-and \u2014 and sent \u2014 was going to send us back. And I\u2014 I\ngot very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from the Russians and I\njust flushed it down the toilet, you know. Because I figured maybe they are going to\nsend me back to the [indecipherable] \u2014 you know, that time you were fearful, you\ndidn\u2019t know. They might send you back to \u2014 to your destiny, where you \u2014 you were\ncoming from. So then I came back to \u2014 to Feldafing, and we start working legally.\n138September 22, 1994\nAnd she helped me so much, this Fruma(ph). Fortunately, they went later to\nCanada, and she\u2019s passed away now. So then \u2014 then I was able to \u2014 I got \u2014 I got\nalready the \u2014 the real papers went to France, and then there I had my visa. I spent in\nFrance a few days, and then I found out, in order to go to United States \u2014 to Cuba,\nI have to go through United States and I need a visa. This is eight months. You had\nto wait for eight months for \u2014 to get \u2014 to get a visa to United States. So I started \u2014 I\nhad all \u2014 I found also a other guy that was going to Cuba, by the name \u2014 same name\nlike me, Abraham, but his name was Rabinowitz(ph). And he told me, wherever\nyou go, I go with you. I said, fine. So I start walking up and down in \u2014 in France, in\nParis, and \u2014 and looking. I spoke a little English, you know, it was easier for me\nbecause he didn\u2019t. And I start looking. Finally, I found \u2014 we found a maiden flight\nof a six-motor hydroplane from Air France, that was going to Dakar, Africa, and\nPort-Etienne. And from there \u2014 and to \u2014 from Dakar to Port-Etienne. So we \u2014\nwhat I did is, we had our tickets from Pan American. We exchanged that, and the\ncompany, they gave us credit and some way we hustled around and \u2014 and all \u2014 all\ntogeth \u2014 and all together, what we had was 10 dollars in our pocket. Then we took\nthe trip with this six-motor hid \u2014 hydroplane and it took us \u2014 it was an incredible\nflight, you know. They gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there.\nAnd then when we came to \u2014 to Port-Etienne, we had to go to Antigua \u2014 British\n139September 22, 1994\nAntigua. So from there, we went \u2014 we had to take a boat and go there, to British\nAntigua. And then from British Antigua, we found out that in order to go to Cuba,\nwe need still an American transit visa because we have to stay in Puerto Rico,\nwhich is an American \u2014",
        "Q: You were carrying a French passport now\u201d?",
        "A: I didn't have a passport.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: I ha\u2014I had a paper which says, stateless A \u2014 a \u2014 a person without a country.\nThat was there for everybody\u2019s standards. It was like \u2014 so finally, in \u2014 in Antigua,\nthere was a \u2014 it\u2019s a very small British island, but very clean. I remember comparing\nit to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to \u2014 to the French, which was just the opposite. The counsel was\nstaying at the same hotel that we stayed there. And the lady that \u2014 we told her our\nstories and made arrangements for us to \u2014 to see the counsel the next day. So next\nday when we went in, and so the first question of the counsel was, do you have\nsome money to sleep overnight in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Puerto Rico? I said, of course. I\nshow him the 10 dollars very proudly. When I came out, I gave it to my friend. He\ncame in with the same 10 dollars, and show that he has also 10 dollars, because that\nwas the minimum that you can have. And then August 1*'\u2014 and from there we\ncabled my uncle that we were coming down. So August 1\u201c, 1947, I landed inSeptember 22, 1994\nCamagiiey [indecipherable] in Havana, and my uncle came with his car to pick\nme up and pick up my \u2014 my friend. And this was the way we came to Cuba.",
        "Q: Long trip.",
        "A: It was a long trip but I found somebody waiting for me.",
        "Q: Now \u2014",
        "A: Now, go ahead with the questions.",
        "Q: I have a couple of questions. I want you to turn your chair back a little bit this\nway.",
        "A: That\u2019s not the question, that\u2019s the answer. [break]",
        "Q: Go on, keep going. Okay, now, there are a couple of things that we talked about.",
        "A: That are missing.",
        "Q: Yes. One is the \u2014 the Ninth Fort.",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 yeah, right.",
        "Q: In late \u2014 late 1943. You can tell me what your memory is of that?",
        "A: Yes. This \u2014 this is is precisely \u2014 I have a book of that which I have not had a\nchance to \u2014 to read. The \u2014 the Ninth Fort was one of the most vicious and criminal\nplaces in \u2014 in the \u2014 Lithuania, whereby, most of the \u2014 most of the inmates from \u2014\nfrom the camps were taken, and \u2014 taken. And it was \u2014 we had few forts, but the\nNinth Fort was the \u2014 was the one that\u2019s for \u2014 were the \u2014 that was best equipped to \u2014September 22, 1994\nto kill and also to dispose of the bodies. But you see, there were so many \u2014 so many\npeople were killed \u2014 or murdered, not killed \u2014 at the Ninth Fort, that they didn\u2019t\nhave \u2014 didn\u2019t give them time to get rid of the bodies. So what they did is, they used\nto burn \u2014 they used to place them in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in rows, you know, one on top of the\nother one. But then, apparently towards at the end of 1943, there came a order from\nthe Reichs command that it has to be something done in order to eliminate the\nbodies. So they were \u2014 they looked for a Sonderkommando, and they took a\nnumber of \u2014 of people and \u2014 of Jews from the \u2014 from \u2014 from the ghetto. And they\nhad decided they had some other people, which they kept there for a long time.\nWhat they used to do with those people is, after they \u2014 after they did their \u2014 their\ndirty work, they used to kill them and then bring in some new people, you know,\nbecause they \u2014 they always tried to \u2014 to hide their tracks behind \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthe evidence behind them. So they brought in this contingency of the\nSonderkommando, and they were there for some time, and they \u2014 they tried to \u2014\nthey exhumed the \u2014 the bodies and they tried to burn them. And the way they did \u2014\nthey used to do that, they used to lay them in \u2014 in layers and \u2014 and put in wood in\nbetween and then pour gas and then \u2014 and the, of course, in the concentration camps\nthey used crematoriums, which were more \u2014 more advanced technology. This, they\ndid it in more primitive way. And incidentally, I have some friends who are \u2014September 22, 1994\nespecially one friend that send me now a book, that escaped, one of the escapees. I\nmean, this was an incredible, incredible escape, which is like escaping from Sing\nSing, or for \u2014 whereby, they \u2014 they have plan. They knew that they are not going to\nlast too long because after they burn, I mean, they are going to be one of those who\nare going to be burned also. So what they plotted is, they found themselves that they\n\u2014 they have, New Year\u2019s Eve, they have some way got some additional \u2014 additional\nliquor for the guards and they \u2014 when they were drunk, they traced \u2014 they had a map\nof the ninth \u2014 of the Ninth Fort and they \u2014 some way they were able to escape and\nthis was a escape like a large group of \u2014 of \u2014 of people was able to escape, you\nknow. And this \u2014",
        "Q: Where did they go?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Where did they go?",
        "A: They \u2014 many of them went to the \u2014 to the partisans. Especially my friend. He\njoined the \u2014 he joined the \u2014 the freedom fighters, and he \u2014 he survived. I mean, he \u2014\nhe survived being in the underground in the freedom fighters.",
        "Q: When you refer to the partisans, are you talking about Russian partisans,\nLithuanian partisans, Jewish partisans?",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were a mixture. They were a mixture. They had \u2014 they had \u2014\n143September 22, 1994\nmost \u2014 most of the time, they had Lithuanian \u2014 had \u2014 had a \u2014 in some cases, where\nhead of the partisans was \u2014 were Lithuanian. In many cases, more of the cases, they\nwere \u2014 they were Russians. But there were some few Lithuanian partisans, head of\npartisans also, depending in what section were you, in what part of the \u2014",
        "Q: But did they fight together in the same groups?",
        "A: No, not necessarily, no.",
        "Q: So when the people from Kovno \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 went out into the \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 forest to fight like you did for a while, were you basically on your own or were\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 you had a different experience, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I was, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 but \u2014 but did they ever join up with the Russians?",

I was born in a small city \u2014 small town in the eastern part \u2014\nnortheastern part of Lithuania by the name of RokiSkis. It was a relatively small\ntown. It was actually a county more than a town, in the sense that there were some\nsurrounding towns \u2014 small towns which, most of the time, our town was famous in\nhaving a large \u2014 not conventions, but I would say markets.

And after my father married [indecipherable] he opened up\nhis own business and the office was normally \u2014 office was in \u2014 in the house. I have\na very nice house and the address of the house \u2014 of course, that's irrelev \u2014 irrelevant.\nThen when \u2014",
        "A: I had \u2014 I had \u2014 I had a very comfortable life in the sense that we had a large\nfamily and we had many, many friends. We had a \u2014 a \u2014 even a Jewish bank in this \u2014\nin this town. There were out of the 6,000 people that lived in the town, I think 50\npercent were \u2014 were Jewish. And it was \u2014 had quite a few synagogues. It was a \u2014September 22, 1994\nand the town was always known \u2014 known as a Chabad town, Chabad, which was\nnow being known was as the Lubavitch. Incidentally, in 1933 the rabbi \u2014 the head\nrabbi from the Lubavitch movement came down to our town and it was a big \u2014 a\nbig event. I remember he came to the train station and he was carried through\nbecause he had a \u2014 he was handicapped. And incidentally, my parents took me to\nhim for a blessing and sometimes I say this blessing maybe was the one that saved\nme from all these difficulties that I went through my life. Now, I had a younger\nsister, and \u2014 two younger sisters. One was four years younger, the other one was\neight years younger than myself. And the cultural life was very \u2014 it was a small city\nbut it was a very \u2014 very unique in the sense of the friendship and the \u2014 had many a\nlarge, large family, plus the fact we were also close to the border of Latvia. And I\nhad a\u2014a aunt who married into Dvinsk, which was about 50, 60 miles, but it was\nalready in Latvia. So we had also relatives that used to come in between Latvia and\nLithuania. When I grew up, I went to a\u2014 to public school. My parents had said \u2014\ndecided to send me to Kovno, which was the \u2014 which was the capital at that time of\nLithuania.",
        "A: Yes, they were not that fanatics but they were \u2014 they were \u2014 the \u2014 the whole \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nyou see, the whole city, the \u2014 those small cities were very much religious. People\nwere \u2014 there were exceptions who were not religious, most \u2014 99 percent were\nreligious, and everybody used to belong to the synagogue, and there were no\nreformed or \u2014 or \u2014 or conservative. There was one type of synagogue. They were\nOrthodox synagogues at that time.",
        "A: Very \u2014 very much in the sense that they were mostly storekeepers and we had\nattorneys, and we had dentists, and we had a \u2014 like I mentioned, we had a bank.\nAnd the head of the bank was also, of course, a Jewish bank which \u2014 and the bank\nbasically, mostly was also in a sense to help need \u2014 people in need and they used to\nalso participate in \u2014 in \u2014in charity and in helping people to establish themselves in\nnew businesses.",
        "A: Jewish and non-Jewish, right, yeah.",
        "A: There were \u2014 everybody was there a Zionist, and many people, incidentally have\n\u2014 at that time, it didn\u2019t exist yet, the State of Israel, but we had in \u2014 in quite a\nnumber of occasions, when Zionist leaders used to come down to our city to \u2014 to\nexplain the necessity of having a \u2014 having our own country and promote the ZionistSeptember 22, 1994\nideas.",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014I moved \u2014 actually, I\u2014 I \u2014I didn't move. My family still stayed on in\nRokiSkis and \u2014 but I was sent to Kovno and that time, at the age of 12 or 13, I was\nsent to my grandparents who used to live in Kovno. And my parents felt very\ncomfortable, the fact that I\u2019m going to be living together with my grandparents and\nmy uncle. So they used to live on \u2014 almost on the main street, was \u2014 which was call\nLaisv\u00e9s al\u00e9ja. That means, in translating, the Alley of Independence. And I was\nright there on the corner of Kanto gatve and Laisv\u00e9s al\u00e9ja, and there used to live \u2014\nmy \u2014 my grandparents used to live and we were very comfortable. And the fact that\nthe school they put me in was also a gymnasium, which was about five minutes\nwalking distance from \u2014 from where they used to live. And of course, I started\ngoing to the \u2014 to the school. The \u2014 the \u2014 the schooling system was extremely well\nand this \u2014 this was the reason also they send me to Kovno, because in the small\ncities they didn't have Hebrew gymnasiums and this was a Hebrew gymnasium.\nAnd incidentally, this gymnasium was on the name of Chase because a benefactor\nby the name of Chase was the one that established \u2014 from United States, was the\none that established this gymnasium in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Kovno, the capital of\nLithuania. So I went through the \u2014 the friend that had many friends. And we \u2014 we\nSeptember 22, 1994\ndidn't have too much time, leisure time, because the system \u2014 the educational\nsystem was extremely, extremely serious, and very disciplined. We used to have\nuniforms with a hat and \u2014 and a special outfit. And we basically started early in the\nmorning, and I used to come back home late and I had to make my homework, and\nwas very, very little time to \u2014 to \u2014 for leisure. Of course, sometimes going to the\nmovies, sometimes \u2014 incidentally, I also lived next store, right around the corner to\nthe opera, which I was very \u2014 you had a \u2014 Lithuania was a small country, but it had\na very cultural \u2014 the cultural life was there, very intense. And by having the opera\naround us and especially myself and also many of our friends were very much\ninvolved in the opera. Of course, we didn't have the money and the resources to \u2014 to\n\u2014to go and sometimes to the opera, but we always find a way to participate and to\nenjoy the cultural life and especially the opera, the ballet. And it was a beautiful,\nbeautiful opera. And this was also was in a compound of a \u2014 within a park, a city\npark. I also remember that I used to read quite a lot. And there was, of course, radio,\nall what we had. And it was in the early stages. We didn't have, of course, TV or\nsome other entertainment. So mostly our activities were basically around the\ncommunity, around the synagogue, which was not too far also from us. Kovno was\na city of about I would say hundred and \u2014 hun \u2014 hundred \u2014 over 100,000 people \u2014\nout of about I would say maybe 150,000 people. Out of them, maybe one \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\none-fourth, one-third was \u2014 were \u2014 were Jewish people.",
        "A: The main \u2014 yes, in the main part, in the \u2014 1n the center \u2014 in the center, right. And\nremember that on Saturday, of course, the \u2014 the school \u2014 were no school and we\nused to walk. We had this \u2014 Laisv\u00e9s al\u00e9ja, the street was composed of a median\nwith benches and \u2014 and a place to \u2014 to walk and \u2014 and to enjoy. The climate \u2014 the\nclimate was also very good in a certain way because of course we had a\u2014 we were\nalmost the same parallel as Montreal, but their climate was a little bit milder, in the\nsense we had very harsh winters and very beautiful summers. And we really\nenjoyed the \u2014 the surroundings. In winter, we used to go skating and \u2014 and had\nsome \u2014 and with sleds, you know, had s \u2014 very war \u2014 it used to be also beautiful in\nthe sense that we used to go out and \u2014 and had the wintertime, you know, with\nhorses and sleds and it was a remarkable \u2014 it was a very interesting and \u2014 and very\njoyful life, yeah.",
        "A: The city was a extremely, extremely clean city. And the buildings, we didn\u2019t\nhave any high-rise buildings there. I think the tallest building was about four \u2014\nfour-stories high. Most of them were two stories. Somewhere in the center of the\ncity, of course, there were commercial buildings and also apartment buildings. We\nSeptember 22, 1994\nhad also a number of movie theaters, and then we had a remnant from when \u2014 when\nLithuania was occupied by Russia, we had a place which was called the\nsabor(ph). The sabor(ph), that was a \u2014 a \u2014 like a church that was not functioning as\na church, but it was like a \u2014 like a remnant from the \u2014 from the tsarist times and \u2014\nand it was used, like, mostly as a museum. We had also few museums. It was also a\nmilitary museum, which was called a karo muziejus. We had \u2014 also the topography\nwas very beautiful because we had like, small mountains surrounding, and we had\ntwo rivers, the Neris and the Nemunas. And of course, wintertime was very joyful,\nthere were \u2014 when they were frozen we used to enjoy the skating and going around,\nand \u2014",
        "A: Jewish life was very, very \u2014 for instance, I \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. I belonged to different \u2014 not different \u2014 there were not too many\norganizations \u2014 Jewish organizations, mostly Zi-Zionist. And also at the same time,\nI belonged to the international organization, which was the badin-badin(ph), which\nwere the boy scouts, which we enjoyed. We used to have outings and the outings\nwere basically \u2014 we used to go out to the forest and then stay there over \u2014 stay over.\nAnd also we were taught different \u2014 different measures in ou-our rel-\nSeptember 22, 1994\nrelationship there, I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 the essence of wha-what does it mean there,\nto be a boy scout in badin-badin(ph). We also \u2014 I remember we were taught also \u2014\nwe used to wave with flags the Morse code, you know, with \u2014 by communicating\nwhich is a \u2014 which ea \u2014 with each other by \u2014 was the little flags like between two\nships, you know. Also, I remember we were also being educated and explained\nabout the \u2014 about Palestine and about the activities that were at that time in\nPalestine, about the \u2014 the influx of the amount of Jewish people to Palestine. Also,\nabout the Ottoman times in Turkey, which were also in some \u2014 or some years ago\nthat Turkey, what \u2014 they had a very big influence on Palestine when they had \u2014\nthey were under Turkish occupation, by the Ottomans and [indecipherable]. We\nwere very extremely well versed. And life went by and I used to go back to my \u2014 in\nthe summertime, I used to go back to join my \u2014 my family to RokiSkis. I remember\nI used to take the train. It would take forever, and it was only about 200 miles. I\ndon\u2019t remember, kilometers or miles, but [indecipherable]. And then I used to join\nmy family and I was very proud. People used to respect me very much for the fact\nthat I am \u2014 I am\u2014I am coming from my big city, or \u2014 my other friends were\neducated in our small city, most of them went to Lithuanian schools. And the\nrelationship between Jews and Lithuanians was very, very cordial, you know, very\nnice, they were very friendly, and we had never had any \u2014 any big sense of\nSeptember 22, 1994\nanti-Semitism. I mean, at least we didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t feel that. Sometimes, in sporadic\ncases, in \u2014 there were certain \u2014 certain acts of hostility, but very, very rare. And\ngoing back and forth, and so we reached the time when I was \u2014 reached eight. The\nlast year was the eight class, you know, and this \u2014 this was the year when we \u2014 I\nwas going to finish the gymnasium and, of course, after gymnasium, as \u2014 as you\nknow, that a gymnasium is like a \u2014 translated in terms of here, American terms, it's\nlike a partially college \u2014 high school and college, whereby we had to take also\nlogaritmais and differentials and ma-many items that were many \u2014 such \u2014 many\nsubjects that were being taken in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in \u2014 in wi \u2014 in the university.\n[indecipherable] My \u2014 I was \u2014 I took Latin because we had \u2014 we were able to take\nsome foreign languages. I \u2014 I\u2014 I took \u2014 Russian, I spoke because when I was born\nmy parents finished Russian schools before Lithuania was independent. So I \u2014 I\nspoke, when I \u2014 in the beginning I spoke Russian. And when I went to \u2014 to school,\nand to cheder, I start speaking Yiddish, and then, of course, Hebrew and then, of\ncourse, Lithuanian. And then I took German in \u2014 in school, I had to take. And then I\ntook Latin because I \u2014 my \u2014 my interest was to become a doctor and my parents\nwanted to send me to Italy because the curriculum in \u2014 in Lithuania was very\nsmall. We had a university, not \u2014 not too big, and that was very difficult to get into\nthe university. So some friends of ours went to Italy and my aim was also to go to\nSeptember 22, 1994\nItaly after finishing gymnasium. And of course, 1939, this was still before \u2014 two\nyears before I finished gymnasium, the \u2014 the Russians \u2014 I mean, the turmoil in\nEurope started. The Russians have decided with the Ribbentrop pact, you know, to\ndivide between Germany and Russia. Russia was going to take over the Baltics;\nLithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. And Germany was take part of Poland, and \u2014 and\nof course, Czechoslovakia and Austria, so forth and so on. So it started already,\nthe feeling we \u2014 we felt that there is something \u2014 something happening, but we have\nnever \u2014 we were confident that our government is \u2014 which was a democratic\ncountry with a president, a parliament, and with quite a lot of liberty and freedom.\nBut in 1939, we have \u2014 we found out one day that we are under the Russian \u2014 the\nRussian \u2014 that the Russians have absorbed the three Baltic states and we \u2014 we have\nheard \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 that like a day or two days ahead of time that the Russian\ntanks are going to be coming into Kovno, to Lithuania. Of course, there was no\nresistance because compared to Russia, we had a small miniature army and there\nwas no way that we were able to fight Russia at that time. And \u2014 and the Russians\ntook \u2014 I remember when they \u2014 when they marched into Lithuania. And right away\nwhen they marched in \u2014 you see, our gymnasium was a Hebrew gymnasium. So\nwhen the Russians came in, they changed their \u2014 right away they eliminate \u2014",
        "A: We didn\u2019t give them permission. [break]",
        "A: The Yeshivot. The biggest Yeshiva, yeah, right, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but can I continue? And then tha \u2014 that was \u2014 make it brief and then \u2014",
        "A: Right, so the Russians came and when they came in, they changed the whole\nsystem. First of all, suddenly from a democracy, we became a part of the Soviet\nUnion, a republic. And right away they started changing the currency. They brought\nin many military personnel. They start taking over and nationalize the businesses.\nThey \u2014 in my \u2014 in RokiSkis, my parents were told that the \u2014 the house is too big, too\nluxury for \u2014 for \u2014 for a family, that we have to take in some families. And they put\nin some families in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the house. They \u2014 our business what \u2014 we had a\nfactory of roofing paper, which was not too big so they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t do\nanything about that. But in Kaunas \u2014 in Kovno, they started nationalizing the big\nbusinesses and they start taking out those people who they felt they are not\nsympathetic with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the Russian government and that they had\nsome \u2014 some kind of history that they were exploiting people. They start taking\nSeptember 22, 1994\nthem out \u2014 taking them to Russia. I remember that, being still in school, I was given\nthe assignment to nationalize a large \u2014 a large wholesale food business, which all\nkinds of items there, and we had to take the inventory. And then, of course, the \u2014\nthe owners were placed temporarily to be the managers and then they were kicked\nout basically, from those businesses. So, in \u2014 in \u2014 in RokiSkis, they also start taking\nout those people who they considered that they are bourgeois. And fortunately my \u2014\nmy parents had very good contacts within the Lithuanian community. Father speak\nperfect Lithuanian, and as I mentioned, he was in the army, so they didn\u2019t touch\nhim. But some of our relatives, they took them out and they send them to Russia,\nand those people had very difficult time but they have \u2014 they \u2014 they were fortunate\nin a certain way. And I'm going later to relate to you, that they were fortunate being\n\u2014 when they were taken to Russia, rather than stay on. So going back to Kaunas,\nwe had \u2014 Kaunas was a, as I mentioned, not a very large city but we had some\nsuburbs. One of them was Slobodka, which was called Vilijampol\u00e9 in Lithuanian.\nAnd this was a center of Jewish learning. There were \u2014",
        "A: People used to come \u2014 students used to come from all over \u2014 all over the world\nto be educated in those yeshivots, which were in Slobodka, which is \u2014 Slobodka\nyeshiva was like a something \u2014 a special place of \u2014 of learning, which many, many\nSeptember 22, 1994\nbig scholars have come out from \u2014 from there \u2014 from this yeshiva. We had another\nyeshiva [indecipherable] Ponevezh, but Slobodka was the \u2014 like the \u2014 the crown\nof the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the learning institutions. And most of the people, it was a \u2014 most\nof Slobodka was comprised of a Jewish population, middle lower class. But people\nwere comfortable. There was not \u2014 nobody was hungry, especially, as I mentioned\nthat Lithuania was an agricultural country. So there was never a shortage of meat\nand \u2014 and bread and \u2014 and some other products like butter and milk, and that. So\nSlobodka was very much considered as a \u2014 a very, very unique and very special\nplace, not only in Lithuania, like I mentioned, but throughout the \u2014 throughout the\nwestern hemisphere.",
        "A: I spend very little time because I was more to \u2014 our gymnasium was not a \u2014 not\nan extreme religious organization. We spoke Hebrew, we observed the holidays, but\nwe were not fanatics like I mentioned. We \u2014",
        "A: I understand.",
        "A: Okay, all right, okay. So we start living under the \u2014 under the regime of \u2014 su-\nSeptember 22, 1994\nsuddenly became from my free country, suddenly became communist. A\ncommunistic system, socialistic system, they call that. And it was, in the beginning,\nwe felt \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel too good about it but then we got used to it. Because\nespecially at the age of 16 \u2014 15, 16, 17, truthfully, we have not \u2014 we were still not \u2014\nhad the burden of carrying on a family and make a living and we \u2014 we were just\nsitting there and watching the changes which happened very, very fast. We saw also\nmany fortifications have become \u2014 have been taken over by the \u2014 of course, the\nRussians have displayed their force. We had a airport which was about \u2014 about\nseven or eight miles from \u2014 from our city. And of course, we didn\u2019t have a\nmilitary \u2014 military planes. I think we had one or two of them. That was considered a\nsizable amount for \u2014 for the \u2014 for the military in Lithuania. So time rolled and we\nhave heard \u2014 Incidentally, at that time, also in the \u2014 after \u201839, we had something\nvery special happen to us and this is \u2014\nEnd of Tape OneSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 the life, the Jewish life in Kovno, and in general Lithuania, changed\nvery drastically, and very dramatically, because we were used to belong la \u2014 to\nbelong to our organizations, Zionistic organizations. These became taboo. That is a\nvery offensive in the Russian \u2014 in the Soviet system, to belong to organizations\nwhich are not within their framework. They \u2014 right away, they expelled all the\nteachers, all the Hebrew teachers, and suddenly we became, rather than a Hebrew\nschool, we became a Yiddish school. Yiddish for them was like the \u2014 main\nlanguage, truthfully, was Yiddish, but Hebrew for them, was \u2014 they had certain\nsuspicions that Hebrew is a little bit too closer to the \u2014 they considered those who\nspoke Hebrew like fascists, in a certain way. So, it was not easy to get transformed\n\u2014 to change sud-suddenly, and \u2014 and \u2014 and especially for us kids, you know, it was\n\u2014 although everybody spoke Yiddish, but the \u2014 the \u2014 the reason why I was sent to\nthis gymnasium was not \u2014 because home we spoke Yiddish, was to learn, and to \u2014\nto get acquainted with \u2014 with Hebrew, and not with Yiddish. But we had to obey\nand do whatever the government has instructed us to do. Now \u2014",
        "A: They were not closed. They were not closed. They still kept them open, but they\nSeptember 22, 1994\nwere under very tight scrutinity(ph). And they watched very much who is going to\nthe synagogue, and who is \u2014 and whether there is some counter-revolutionary \u2014\nsome kind of feeling or sentiments towards something which is not in the \u2014 in the\nscope of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the Soviet theory. Now, in meantime, time was going on\nand the happenings in Europe were very traumatic, and \u2014 and very drastic.\nCzechoslovakia fell. We suddenly had an influx of checs \u2014 Czechoslovakian \u2014\nCzechoslovakian refugees. Some of them \u2014 many of them Jewish, who came \u2014 and\nthey came actually to RokiSkis, not to Kaunas. They were afraid to go to the large\ncities, cause they were afraid to be interned, and then sent back to \u2014 to\nCzechoslovakia. And they start telling us about \u2014 first of all, it was very hard for us\nto \u2014 to bring them in, because they \u2014 they were \u2014 they came in illegally. But we\nprovided them \u2014 first of all, we took them to a synagogue, and we made them\ncomfortable there, and there, little by little, we spread them out to different family\nhouses. And they start telling us about the horrors, about what Hitler is doing to the\nJewish population, and especially in Czechoslovakia. And most of those people\nwho came, were very intelligent people, like one of them was a \u2014 I remember very\nvividly, one was a painter, and his paintings was fantastic. I remember even that he\nhelped me to paint some \u2014 I had to make the \u2014 to make a thesis about certain \u2014\ncertain things in \u2014 1n school, and he helped me to, with a \u2014 with a \u2014 with the\n20September 22, 1994\npaintings, whereby he \u2014 he was actually a perfect painter, you know, that. The other\none, I remember the name, one was Foyer(ph) Opataker(ph), the other one was a\nbusinessman who lost his business, and he a \u2014 was able to escape, just by himself.\nHe was not able even to bring his family. They \u2014 then we had also influx from \u2014\nfrom Polish refugees, who came \u2014 especially Polish military people, who interned\nthemselves. But this \u2014 they \u2014 they came in actually legally \u2014 not I \u2014 they \u2014 I mean\nthey \u2014 they crossed the border, and then they surrendered. So, of course their arms\nwere taken away, and \u2014 and they were placed in a \u2014 in\u2014 I remember in a \u2014 1n the\ncenter of the city, that was in RokiSkis. And I remember seeing them with their \u2014\nwhere they took \u2014 care more on \u2014 they were more concerned about their boots and\ntheir uniforms than about some other \u2014 other things, you know.",
        "A: So this \u2014 this affected us, as youngsters, affected us very much, and \u2014 and we\nstarted listening to their stories, and \u2014 and then the horror stories that were \u2014 about\nthe killings, about the rapes, about the robberies, about the \u2014 and \u2014 and we just \u2014 I\nremember I just was sitting, like I\u2019m sitting now in the armchair, and listening to\nwhat they had to say. But of course, after I listen to their stories, I went \u2014 I had my\nfood, and I had my \u2014 my room, and my bed, and the next day I got involved again in\nmy daily duties. So, it affected us, but what we have not \u2014 we \u2014 we s \u2014 we should \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nlooking in retrospect, we should have been a little bit more concerned, and more\ncareful, and \u2014 which, we didn\u2019t do that, and \u2014",
        "A: We didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t think that this was going to expand. We felt that we are\nnow very well protected under the Soviet regime, which Soviet Russia was\nconsidered \u2014 I \u2014 a stronghold, you know, and the \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, and we felt that\nwe re \u2014 we\u2019re 1n the safe side. In the meantime, in \u2014 in our house was also we were\n\u2014 we were compelled to take in some bor \u2014 some tenants, and one of them was a\u2014a\n\u2014 was a Russian pilot. There was one pilot, and then they joined the other one. And\nwe had to give up one of the rooms, and they \u2014 and they were there together with\nus. And I finished the gymnasium, we got ready to go back home, but for some\nreason, the certificates of completion were not made available. So I felt rather than\nto go back home, and I \u2014 I was very proud that I finish without any \u2014 any problems\n\u2014I was not one of the best teacher \u2014 students, but I \u2014 I did my homework, and I \u2014 I\nnever failed from one year to the other one. So I was waiting for to get a certificate\nin order to be able to come home, and to bring the sa \u2014 say I-I finished, and\ngraduated, and I\u2019m ready to go to university. So this was in the middle of June. And\nthey told me that the certificates are going to be finished by June \u2014 by the later part\nof June, and I felt I\u2019m going to stay for a few more days. You know, school hasSeptember 22, 1994\nfinished. The summer was there, and it was nice, and we got a little bit more used to\nthe \u2014 to the \u2014 to our new system, and came June 21\", nighttime, and suddenly we\nhad a\u2014 we heard a\u2014 some movement in the \u2014 in the room, from the two pilots that\nwe had. And they suddenly, middle of the night, they run out, without saying\nanything. They disappeared. And a little while later we heard bombings, we heard\nplanes. And we put on the radio, and this was the invasion of the second \u2014 actually\nthe \u2014 the Nazi part of the second World War started. Whereby that Hitler didn\u2019t\nannounce, without announcing, he just \u2014 he starts \u2014 start the invasion. And he\nactually deceived anybody, because there were no massed troops on the borders that\ntime. He just tried to get this war started, and \u2014 and \u2014 and started war by surprise.\nAnd it was really a surprise, because no \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody was \u2014 was ready for\nthat. Everybody was living with the dreams that they had this Ribbentrop pact, it\nwas Molotov, and \u2014 and that both parts were satisfied that there is no \u2014 we \u2014 we\nleaned more to the fact that we thought that he is going to \u2014 if he 1s going to attack,\nhe is going to go against England, rather than \u2014 than \u2014 it was a \u2014 a incredible\nsurprise. So, right away it \u2014 I remember my house, we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what\nto do. We had also a other tenant, which I didn\u2019t mention before, that was \u2014 yeah?\nWhat \u2014 what \u2014\n23September 22, 1994",
        "A: Okay, fine, eliminate it. We had a other tenant that was in the \u2014 in the \u2014 worked\nin the transportation. And he told us right away that there is a truck going to be\navailable if we want \u2014 we want to go, but we were so confused, and everybody \u2014 we\nsaw masses of soldiers, Russian soldiers running from one place to the other one.\nThey bombed \u2014 basically, when they started bombing, they bombed the airport, and\nthen certain military objectives. And the \u2014 the whole city became a \u2014 a \u2014 a turmoil.\nAnd we also heard about, through the radio, they start announcing that Germany\nhas attacked the Soviet Union, and wir \u2014 that \u2014 the Lithuanians are \u2014 this was still\nwith the Russians there, that the Lithuanians are very much in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014in\nfavor of \u2014 of reading and \u2014 and receiving the \u2014 the victorious \u2014 the victorious\nGerman troops. When I \u2014 I wanted to reach my house, because I \u2014 I felt to \u2014 to unite\nmyself with the family. And I start running on the \u2014 in the highway, with my\nbicycle. I got my bicycle, and \u2014 and when I came to a certain point, I saw people\ncoming towards us and said, return, because there is atrocities on the highway. They\n\u2014 they fly low, the German airplanes, and they \u2014 and they just kill everybody that is\non there, on the highways. From time to time you have to run off and \u2014 and throw\nyourself on \u2014 on the ground, because the \u2014 the massacres are just incredible,\nespecially in \u2014 because, you see the civilians, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 the Russians were\nalso \u2014 they were mixed. They were running together. Many Russian trucks, they \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nright away they \u2014 they \u2014 they start abandoning their military supplies, and military\nbarracks, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they just try to move eastward, you know, towards \u2014\ntowards Russia. And this was so dramatic, and we \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know. We had\nsome relatives on the \u2014 we had a \u2014 that was called a \u2014 the klininbar(ph), that\u2019s the \u2014\nthe green \u2014 the Green Mountain. That was a \u2014 a place within \u2014 within Kovno where\nwe had some relatives who \u2014 who \u2014 from my aunt\u2019s part, who lived there. We felt\nmaybe to go to them, there in that place maybe would be safer. So we went up\nthere, and then we came back to our \u2014 to our apartment, feel the safest place is to\nstay in the apartment. Killings started, and especially Lithuanians, where they were\nvery bo \u2014 very much against \u2014 against the Soviets. They hated the Soviets, you\nknow, from the beginning. So \u2014 and they considered that there are some Jewish\npeople were in the communists, and \u2014 and they \u2014 right away they wanted to take\nvengeance, you know, and what they did is, they right away start killing people,\nstart torturing them, start \u2014 there was a s \u2014 a special \u2014 a special torture chamber,\nwhich was made to a \u2014 to a torture chamber, which was made in a \u2014 one of their gas\nstations. They brought in about 20 people, and they put hoses in their mouth, and\nthey \u2014 and they start water pressuring. And they just killed them with the \u2014 with\nthat. I mean, there were so \u2014 such atrocity that beyond \u2014 beyond description. And\nthe Germans were not in yet. The ger \u2014 Germans were still \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 you see,\n25September 22, 1994\nthe Germans, they had their tactics of the surrounding in a ring, and then closing up\nin the ring, an-and \u2014 and coming to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the focal point where they were\ngoing to occupy. The \u2014 for the Russians it was a incredible shock what happened,\nand they \u2014 they were really not prepared and not ready for the oncoming victorious\nGerman troops. There were also announcements in the radio two days later, where it\nsaid that \u2014 it was in Lithuanian, in Russian, and in German, what said that \u2014 but\nbasically highlighting in Lithuanian. The victorious German troops are coming, are\nclose to Kovno, they are going to enter Kovno in \u2014 in the next hours, and we have\nnoticed that some snipers, and some communists, and some Jews have \u2014 are\nresisting, and shooting against them. So we want to mention that for each German\nsoldier that is going to be killed \u2014 that\u2019s going to be killed \u2014 hundred Jews or\ncommunists are going to be taken and shot, without \u2014 without any \u2014 any question.\nAnd this was constantly, and \u2014 and constantly in the radio. So we \u2014 we felt already,\nwe knew what \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s coming and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t realize that we felt,\nmaybe after Kovno is going to be taken over by the Germans, maybe they are going\nto establish their \u2014 their rules, and they are going to be more human than \u2014 than the\nLithuanians, but this was not the case, and they occupied Kovno. Then suddenly,\nevery day they used to make \u2014 promulgate a \u2014 a new decree. One decree, the first\none was that all Jews have to bring into the kommandantur any arms, if they hadSeptember 22, 1994\nany \u2014 any \u2014 any radios. Any watches. Anything, right away. Then there came a\nsecond decree, that the Jews cannot walk on the sidewalk, they have to walk on the\n\u2014 on the \u2014 on the street side. Third decree was that you have to give up all your \u2014 all\n\u2014 all the valuables. If you have some jewelry, some \u2014 some \u2014 any kind, any type of\njewelry, stamps \u2014 I had a big collection of stamps, myself. I had to take my stamps\nand take it over to the \u2014 to the kommandantur. And that was considered \u2014",
        "A: You know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the remedy, and they \u2014 they \u2014 what \u2014 what they s \u2014 they\nstressed is, if by any chance we spot check, and we found that after this \u2014 they give\nyou like 24 hours, or 48 hours to return all the \u2014 all the valuables. If they spot\ncheck, and they find somebody that has something what they \u2014 what the decree was\nabout, they would take him out and shoot him right away. So no \u2014 nobody had \u2014 I\nthink most of the people didn\u2019t want to \u2014 well, want to risk \u2014 of course, we risked,\nand \u2014 and it was a \u2014 it was like taking your \u2014 your life in your hands. But in the\nbeginning, you \u2014 you didn\u2019t know what \u2014 what it \u2014 what it \u2014 to do, or not to do,\nbecause we \u2014 now, the last decree was that all Jews have \u2014 that was already a month\nlater, in August, that all Jews have to come, and they\u2019re making a ghetto, surr-\nsurrounded by barbed wire, and this ghetto, all the Jews have to trans-transport\nthemselves, for their own means, get us a horse and buggy, and \u2014 and travel to the\n27September 22, 1994\nghetto, which is in Vilijampol\u00e9, in Slobodka. This is where they decided, because\nthey were originally a Jewish population, and those Lithuanians who were living\nthere, have to give up their houses, and they were going to be resettled in some\nother houses, which were left by \u2014 by \u2014 by the Jews. I mean, that was like quid pro\nquo \u2014 pro quo, you know, they exchange. So right away we started looking for a \u2014\nfor a place, and there was also on first come, first move in basis. But of course,\nthere were certain \u2014 they give you certain parameters, whereby that if you take \u2014 if\nyou can\u2019t work out with a Lithuanian some kind of deal, whereby you can give him\nyour house, and give him some nice furniture, and on top of that give him\nsomething extra, what \u2014 and we were fortunate to find a \u2014 a house in Linkuvos\ngatve, I think it was, number 45, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And we found a house, but the\nhouse was \u2014 it was a house, but in the house you had to \u2014 you \u2014 you were able just\nonly \u2014 only about four or five people to occupy only one room. And the rest of the\nrooms were distributed to some \u2014 some other people.",
        "A: With us was staying a\u2014 my uncle, my aunt \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014 the house that we were moved in, in Slobodka in the ghetto was my\nuncle; my aunt; my cousin, who was two years old at that time \u2014 or one and a halfSeptember 22, 1994\nyear; my grandmother. That was in \u2014 in one \u2014 in one room. Then in the other rooms\nwas a\u2014 arelative, a brother of my aunt, with his wife, with a little baby. In the other\nrooms were two ladies, a older lady, a younger name \u2014 by the name of\nLondonski(ph), and their daughter. So we were like three families, in a very little\ntiny-miney house, you know. We had a small yard, we had \u2014 the facilities were not\nin the house, they were outside. I had some water, and we had some certain things\nthat we brought along with us, except for valuables. And this, when we\u2019re \u2014 when\nthey closed the ghetto \u2014 that was in the beginning \u2014 the right way, when they closed\nthe ghetto, they wanted to show their \u2014 their \u2014 that they \u2014 they mean business, so\nwhat they took is one \u2014 one guy that apparently they claimed that he hadn't\ncomplied with the \u2014 with the rules, they took him out and they publicly hanged him.\nAnd he was hanging for about a week. So everybody in the center of the \u2014 of the\nghetto in \u2014 everybody that came by should have si \u2014 looked at \u2014 his name was\nMac(ph), and I think \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m sure that \u2014 I\u2019m not I\u2019m sure, but I know that\nKalish(ph) has a picture from that, which she took with this candid camera.",
        "A: We had to walk by \u2014 by this man hanging for about a week. Week\u2019s a long time\nnow. When we came into the ghetto, right away they establish \u2014 they start again\nwith all kind of tricks, playing with us. The first \u2014 the first decree was that they\nSeptember 22, 1994\nneed 500 educated intel \u2014 intelligentsia \u2014 intelligent people, who finished the\ngymnasium, and they need them for a very special task. They need them right away,\nand you have to \u2014 you have to come in by certain hour, in a certain place in the\ncenter of the ghetto. So, everybody was \u2014",
        "A: So, they came out with a new decree, and this was to get five \u2014 they needed 500",
        "A: The Germans \u2014 the Germans, soon they closed the ghetto \u2014 [bells] [break] \u2014\nshould have thought of that, it\u2019s right after this \u2014 after the decree. The Germans\nhave promulgated a decree, whereby that they need 500 immediately, for a very\nspecial task, 500 educated intelligentsia people who were \u2014 had certain level of\neducation. In order to be able to comply with this \u2014 with this special requirement.\nAnd everybody was some kind, you know, just came into the ghetto, and \u2014 and we\nwere short on food, and then they also promised that they are going to be rewarded,\nvery much re \u2014 very properly rewarded with \u2014 with food that \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody\nspoke about money. Money was irrelevant at that time. The \u2014 the basic thing was\nfood, food and food, you know. So everybody was rushing. My uncle \u2014 my aunt\u2019s\n30September 22, 1994\nbrother told me that he would like to \u2014 he would like to go, and he had just to \u2014 he\nwas in process of shaving or something, that I should wait for him few minutes. I\nwas not too familiar with the ghetto yet, because it was split up in such a way, and I\nwas never that \u2014 in that section of the city, maybe once or twice in my lifetime,\nbecause I had also a \u2014 a football place, where my Maccabi(ph) used to play there,\nin Slobodka, and my uncle \u2014 one of my uncles was a very, very good football\nplayer, so I\u2014 sometimes, you know, I was \u2014 but this was a new situation. So, I\ndidn\u2019t know, and we were a little bit nervous, in the sense we wanted to be there on\ntime. We didn\u2019t have \u2014 we didn\u2019t have watches, you know, we had to look at the\nsun, and to approximately make sure that we\u2019re in the right time. We \u2014 we start\ngoing, looking for a \u2014 for a place where they \u2014 where we were supposed to get, and\nwe got there like 10 minutes late. There were already 506 people, were already up\nthis \u2014 fulfill this assignment, this projected amount of people, and the \u2014 the\nGermans were satisfied, and you know, Germans are very meticulous and punctual.\nAnd they said, we have already the amount, and you go back, we don\u2019t need you\nany more. So we were a little disappointed, you know, we came back. In meantime,\nwhat happened within the \u2014 in the time that the Jews start moving to the ghetto, they\nwere marry \u2014 many atrocities committed by Lithuanians. I mean, they were \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were \u2014 just became so barbaric, and without any \u2014 any \u2014 any reason,September 22, 1994\nyou know. They \u2014 they start killing, raping, an-and taking away all kind of \u2014 all\nkind of items that belonged to \u2014 to the Jewish people, you know, when they \u2014 when\n\u2014 every time we moved, when we moved to the \u2014 to the Green Mountain, we were\ngoing to my aunt\u2019s brother\u2019s house. He had there a little farm, and we felt we\u2019re\ngoing to go over there, and we\u2019re going to be able to have some food, because he\nhad \u2014 the farm still belonged to him. So, when we went there, there were \u2014\nnighttime came in, and a group of like three or four people with their guns, and they\nstarted taking away everything, whatever we \u2014 and \u2014 and my uncle stood up for\nthem, so they hit him with their \u2014 with their \u2014 with their rifle butt, you know.",
        "A: So we felt very, very defenseless, because there were no \u2014 nobody to protect\nanybody. I mean, it was a completely chaos and everyone did \u2014 whoever had a gun\n\u2014I mean, he was the one that \u2014 similar to what\u2019s happened now in Haiti. Whoever\nhad a gun, he was \u2014 he was able to do what \u2014 what \u2014 what he wished, you know.\nThere were no \u2014 no \u2014 absolutely \u2014 the Germans have not taken over yet. They \u2014\nthey were in, but they mind their own business, and they let Lithuanians to enjoy\nthemselves, doing what they did. And it was \u2014 was terrible things they have done.\nThey have taken people to their \u2014 to their \u2014 to \u2014 to a prison. And there was also a\nteacher of my \u2014 I remember [indecipherable] Goldman(ph), a familiar name. He\n32September 22, 1994\nwas our English teacher. He was himself from South Africa. And he was a\ncompulsive smoker, so the \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t give him any \u2014 anything to smoke, so he\nused to get the small ration of \u2014 of bread, he used to exchange that for \u2014 for\ncigarettes. And he finally succumbed, he died, you know, because he \u2014 he just \u2014 his\nbody wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t resist it. But beside the beatings, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the terror that they \u2014 they have implanted him in was \u2014 it was just\nterrible. It was a case which \u2014 I have to describe that \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 a Russian tank failed\nto \u2014 when they were \u2014 by escaping, they \u2014 they just \u2014 he was right next to the \u2014 next\nto the river, the Nemunas. For some reason, I mean, he emerged in \u2014 in water, and\ngot stuck there. They caught about 20 people, they put them like \u2014 like \u2014 like\nhorses, you know, to pull out a t\u2014 how can 20 people pull out a tank, which is who\nknows how many tons is the weight of the tank, and they just hit \u2014 hit the people, hit\nthe people, til mo-most of them were blooded, and \u2014 and \u2014 and were \u2014 were fainted,\nyou know, in the \u2014 that \u2014 that was the \u2014 that was the situation. So one \u2014 1n a certain\nway, when we came into the ghetto, we felt a little bit safer in our surrounding. We\nknew that \u2014 that there are going to be \u2014 we \u2014 we predicted, we anticipated some\natrocities, but \u2014 but at least they were going to be in a\u2014 in a\u2014 1n a\u2014 1n a certain \u2014 in\na certain \u2014 done in a certain way. We with \u2014 with some kind of order, no-not with \u2014\nnot \u2014 not just as sporadic, you know. So \u2014\n33September 22, 1994",
        "A: No, those people who were running, and who came, who try to come back, I\nmean there\u2019s \u2014 most of them were \u2014 were just killed in the \u2014 on the highways, and\nthey \u2014 they would just come into a house, they would \u2014 people who still didn\u2019t\ncome together. Because the process to come into the ghetto was like a 30 day\nprocess. So they used to assault them, and then take away all their \u2014 whatever their\n\u2014 their \u2014 whatever they had, their packages, their suitcases, their valises, and \u2014 and\nthey used to, in many cases people would kill them, in order just not to take them,\nbecause they used to take them out and \u2014 and shoot them in the outside, so \u2014",
        "A: There were also \u2014",
        "A: There were systematic. There were also a \u2014 they were called the Sauliai. That\nwas a Lithuanian organization which are like \u2014 they were called like \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they were made \u2014 their make-up was from the \u2014 from \u2014 they were not \u2014\nnot army people, but it was like organization who used the uniform of sha \u2014 Sauliai\nwas like the \u2014 like the \u2014 they were called like the riflemen. And then these people\nwould exert incredible, incredible hatred, and \u2014 and hate, an-and they would come\n34\nSeptember 22, 1994\nout and \u2014 and do all kind of atrocities, you know. And they \u2014 they were able to do\nanything they wanted, because the \u2014 because the Germans would let them do that,\nbecause they felt that they are, in a certain way, that they are pleasing them, and\nthey \u2014 they were going to have them on their side when \u2014 when \u2014 when they need it.\nAnd this was actually a fact, because most of the \u2014 of the massacres were done by th\n\u2014 by the Lithuanians under \u2014 under the supervision \u2014 certain supervision of the\nGermans.\nEnd of Tape TwoSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: I\u2014I saw the \u2014 because I was almost trapped in this \u2014 when \u2014 when they \u2014 what\nhad happened with the tank, you know? I saw that, it was in my vicinity. And then\nthe \u2014 my uncle was very smart, he actually took the \u2014 I mean, he took the position to\nsit in-inside the apartment, then we have to [indecipherable] to sit inside. And\nfortunately, we were living in a\u2014 in a place where were \u2014 there were not many\nJewish people there. And the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the manager of this place, because it was\nmostly offices, and the manager of the place was very, very nice Lithuanian guy,\nyou know, exceptional. And he would not \u2014 they came, I mean, a few occasions, to\nask him whether there\u2019s some Jews living there, and he would say that, not to his\nknowledge, you know. I mean, he \u2014 he actually saved us, you know. It wouldn\u2019t be\nfor him, we would be [indecipherable]. But the first days, I mean, it was a\ncomplete [indecipherable]. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 I had myself, have \u2014 have seen\npeople beaten and \u2014 and \u2014 and hurt, and especially what happened in Lietiikis with\nthis \u2014 with this horses, you know. This was a \u2014 we \u2014 we have a\u2014 we \u2014 we have seen\nnot exactly what happened there, but we have seen the \u2014 well, the way they took in\nthe people, and \u2014 and we \u2014 we know for a fact, I mean, I \u2014 there were also picturesSeptember 22, 1994\nabout it. But they \u2014 they have \u2014 there were a few thousand people who were \u2014 who\nwere documented as \u2014 as killed in the first \u2014 in the first few days. And these were\npeople that \u2014 that they s \u2014 not only they run to the highway, but people who were\njust systematically taken out from their houses. They went with their list, apparently\nthey had a list of \u2014 of addresses, would take them out and then just \u2014 not \u2014 it \u2014 it wa\n\u2014 shooting was not th-the \u2014 the great part, but \u2014 but to torture, all kind of ways of\ntorturing, you know, like chopping off a arm, a-and especially also with children.\nThat was terrible, and all, but what they have done with \u2014 with children, like\nsmashing them against the wall, or \u2014 and most of the time they were drunk, you\nknow. Because for one thing is the Lithuanians knew \u2014 I mean, they were very\neducated in \u2014 in drinking. They used to made \u2014 make a lot of homemake \u2014\nhomemade vodka. It was called samagonda(ph), it was made from potatoes. And\nthis was, like in the times of prohibition, you know, th-this \u2014 this was \u2014 you know,\ndue to the fact of the climate, that we have a cold climate, there are very many,\nmany drunks on the \u2014 on the streets. There were always many drunks, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand this drinking didn\u2019t help the situation in the beginning, because they had that\navailable, they \u2014 they took over some places where there were all kinds of \u2014 of\nliquor, an-and \u2014 and wine, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they would empty this out, and th \u2014 th-\nthis \u2014 this was also something that they had in common with the Russians, who\nSeptember 22, 1994\nwere also very good in that, you know, in drinking. So th-that \u2014 they had the first \u2014\nthe first few days there were numerous amounts of \u2014 of people that were \u2014 they\nwere counted possibly in the couple thousands of them, yeah.",
        "A: They \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had lists. They \u2014 they came out \u2014 apparently\nsomebody submitted them, they had lists with addresses, and they \u2014 and beside that,\neven they didn\u2019t have a list, they used to come in, smash in, break into the door, and\nsay \u2014 and they would right away spot who is who. And there was something else.\nSomething else I have to mention is that right after \u2014 after we were \u2014 after the\nGermans came in, they came about 15 \u2014 two weeks afterwards, we had to start\nusing the yellow stars. This was a \u2014 first, in the beginning on the front, and then we\nhad to use them front and back. And they cannot be clipped in, they had to be sewn\nin, cause clipped in they claim that you can take it off, and so \u2014 so they, right away\nthey knew how to identify. And there was also a very strict order, those people who\nwouldn\u2019t wear a \u2014 a\u2014a Jewish star, they would not ask any more questions. That\nwould be the \u2014 the end of \u2014 of those \u2014 this person that would not carry the \u2014 the star.\nSo \u2014\n38September 22, 1994",
        "A: About?",
        "A: First, in the beginning I felt like I\u2014 like I\u2014 I have a chip on my shoulder, you\nknow. But then you \u2014 you get used, you know, we\u2019re in \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019 re creatures of\n\u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of nature, of \u2014 of getting \u2014 getting used to things, you know, after \u2014 there\nis [indecipherable] saying, I mean, that you sleep over one night with a problem,\nand the next morning, I mean, there \u2014 there\u2019s no problem, th-th-the \u2014 your \u2014 th-then\nyou have already a other problem, which \u2014 which comes across, you know, but so \u2014\nand that\u2019s true, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 in a certain way we \u2014 there was also a question why\n\u2014 why we didn\u2019t resist. There were some \u2014 some cases of resistance. There was a\ncase of a schoolmate of mine, his name was Discant(ph), that he dressed himself as\na \u2014 as a German officer, and \u2014 [interruption, break] He \u2014 he \u2014 there were formed,\nsmall groups of resistance, really in \u2014 were in the forming. They were a little older\nthan myself, they were a little more mature. Those who \u2014 who started \u2014 who started\norganizing. And there was a friend of mine, already a friend that we used to \u2014 he\nused to come to my house, and we used to \u2014 to not only go to school together, but to\nhave some and certain things in common, you know. So he \u2014 he was dressed as a \u2014\ndressed a German officer, and they \u2014 they were supposed to escape to the forest,\nyou know, to pro at \u2014 I mean, to institute their resistance. And apparently the guy,September 22, 1994\nthe chauffeur that\u2019s supposed to take them, betrayed them. And then \u2014 and that was\nalready not the Lithuanians, but the Germans caught them, and they took them to\nthe Gestapo and they shot them, all of the, you know, there were like 14 people and\none of \u2014 he was one of those. So there were start \u2014 and the question is, why didn\u2019t\nyou have resistance. Because the Russian army that was there, and they had their \u2014\ntheir \u2014 their arms, and they were not resisting, because they saw the handwriting on\nthe wall, they saw what actually happened, they saw the might. And when the \u2014 I\nremember the day the Germans came in, and I looked through the window. My\nuncle used to pull me back, I shouldn\u2019t look through the window, because an-any\nmoment, I mean, somebody can shot \u2014 shoot you, you know. Tha \u2014 when they came\nin, and they \u2014 and they paraded in the street, they came in clean, with their boots\nshining, you could \u2014 like mirrors, you know, and with loudspeakers. Ahead of them\nwere Lithuanians who were pronouncing that the victorious German army is\ncoming in, that they \u2014 this is only a \u2014 are going to be established here. But the army\nis going to move on, and \u2014 and finish with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the Soviets, and it\u2019s\na matter only of a short time. They expect to do that within the summer. That was \u2014\nthat was June. So they figured, June, July, August, September, October gets ready.\nSo they \u2014 they thought their \u2014 they were projecting to occupy the Soviet Union\nabout four or four months, you know, which they \u2014 Napoleon was not able to doSeptember 22, 1994\nthat also, you know. He had the same \u2014 the same pattern. But resisting, I \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\nwas \u2014 everybody was on the shock, you know. And \u2014 and normally, we people were\nnot ready for \u2014 for resisting. We have never had an-anything, any training in \u2014 in \u2014\nin \u2014 in arms. When I know that later on, I\u2019m going to tell you that \u2014 which I hi \u2014\nwill tell you now, that I used to, in many cases I used to take off my \u2014 my stars, and\n\u2014 and then used to go out and I was blondish, I didn\u2019t look too much as \u2014 well, non-\nJewish, and I used to go out and \u2014 and trade certain things in order to get \u2014 to get\nsome food, because their f \u2014 the food situation became very critical, very critical.\nAs soon they took us into the ghetto, they \u2014 they started in \u2014 they started taking\nbrigades, they were called brigades. When a brigadier creates \u2014 they instituted a \u2014a\npolice, a Jewish police was in the ghetto, and then they instituted also the \u2014 a Jewish\ncouncil. So, first of all they were \u2014 had to repair to fix the airports. So everybody\nwas compelled to go out in the morning, five o\u2019clock in the morning had to be in the\nreunion place, and then they used to come and \u2014 with guards, and \u2014 and walk to the\n\u2014 to the airport. So I remember they used to give us 200 grams of bread, and I used\nto put it in the pocket, an-and by the time I came to the \u2014 to the airport, and when\nthey used to give us some soup, which was made of water, and well, with some \u2014\nsome vegetables, some kind of this [indecipherable] vegetables, you know. And\nthey used to boil that, and by that time I didn\u2019t have really bread, because walking, I\nSeptember 22, 1994\n\u2014I used to chew off on the portion of bread. So the situation of \u2014 the food situation\nbecame very \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the duration was very, very bigger. And we \u2014 we had to\ntrade sometimes, certain objects with the \u2014 with Lithuanians. So, in the beginning,\nthey used to let the \u2014 we were able to do that, but there were some \u2014 some people\nwho didn\u2019t have a heart, from the Lithuanian side, you know. For instance, used to\ntrade a\u2014 a-\u2014a suit for a\u2014 for a kilo of butter. So after you \u2014 you have to do that fast,\nyou know, because they \u2014 you had to do that when the guard was with his back to \u2014\nto you, you know. So, in the desperation you found out sometimes that instead of\nbutter, what you had is a big stone, on that \u2014 I mean, with \u2014 with a\u2014 with a little bit\n\u2014 with a little bit of butter on \u2014 on the sides, you know. And it was disaster, and you\n\u2014 you were unable to do anything, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 those people who were free\nhad all the rights. We were \u2014 we \u2014 we lost [indecipherable] lost, we were\ninhunamen \u2014 | mean, not \u2014 not considered human. They \u2014 although they didn\u2019t\ntattoo us with \u2014 with \u2014 on the beginning [indecipherable] afterwards in \u2014 when\nthey took to the concentration camp. So life was \u2014 was terrible, especially in the\nbeginning, it \u2014 it-it was very hard to \u2014 to get the \u2014 get used to and accommodate it,\nbut \u2014 but there was no \u2014 no choice. You had to \u2014 you had to do what you were told\nto do, you know, it\u2019s \u2014\n42September 22, 1994",
        "A: No, it was \u2014 it was very organized.",
        "A: Was very \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 very much \u2014 the move \u2014 the move to the ghetto was very organized. Was very\norganized in the sense that you would hardly see fights between people that, no I\nwant this house, I want that house. There were certain \u2014 that was certain way\norganized that you were able \u2014 of course, you had to get yourself a \u2014 somebody \u2014 a\nhorseman with a buggy and \u2014 and be able to \u2014 to carry over, and couple pieces of\nfurniture, and mostly the \u2014 the \u2014 your personal belongings. But it was in a certain\nway \u2014 it was in certain way organized, because by \u2014 by the people themselves. You\nknow, it\u2019s not \u2014 we di \u2014 we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we had a certain leadership which was\nalready instituted, but it was not a \u2014 a \u2014 a full time leadership, it was just \u2014 they\ncame with the least, and they told you look, you have to go here, here, here, and you\nhave to do this and this and it, and wa \u2014 you know, the people were very much\norganized, and very much respectful, you know, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re not \u2014 we were not\nstrict people, you know, it was mostly people who were \u2014 who had a certain\nbackground, and you hardly were able to find somebody that was not educated, that\nwas not able to read or write. This was \u2014 you take from the Lithuanians, you hadSeptember 22, 1994\nlike 50 percent for the people were illiterate, you know, especially those who lived\non the farms, they \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t know how to read or write. They used to put\na cross for \u2014 when they had to sign something, you know. And this was the sad part,\nyou know, because people who are not literate, and who drink a lot and who don\u2019t\nhave any \u2014 any \u2014 any \u2014 any feeling towards \u2014 towards [indecipherable] humans,\nthey \u2014 they become \u2014 they become very \u2014 they become like animals, you know, and\n\u2014 and this is what \u2014 what happened there, and I really regret to say that, that there\nwere, of course cases whereby they harbored Jews, they helped to escape, and\nthere\u2019s \u2014 but that was sporadic, I mean, that was like a one percent, or something,\nthat \u2014 that have \u2014 were human. And this was also most people who were a little bit\nbetter educated, and who actually knew the facts, and \u2014 and who \u2014 who were able to\n\u2014 to analyze, and \u2014 and \u2014 and realize that saving somebody in these critical times,\nalthough they expose their lives, because any \u2014 anybody that saved a Jew was like \u2014\noh, it \u2014 would be \u2014 would be shot the same way, like the \u2014 those people that they\nsaved.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, no. There were no schools there. But amazingly \u2014 amazingly that in the\nghetto, we were like 30 some thousand people, were pushed into this couple square\nkilometers in very inhuman conditions. But th-the \u2014 the ghetto life right away \u2014 I\nmean, we right away organized ourselves. We had like \u2014 we had a \u2014 a \u2014 a el-elder\u2019s\n[indecipherable] which was a council, with a head of the council, which was a\nprominent \u2014 a prominent doctor. For many years, a Lithuanian \u2014 he was a M.D., and\nhe \u2014 he was considered one of the top doctors in Lithuania, Dr. Elkes. And he was\nvery strict, very \u2014 in the beginning he didn\u2019t want to take the job, but the \u2014 the other\npeople from the \u2014 I mean, the head people from the ghetto came to him, and they\npleaded with him that he should \u2014 he should there \u2014 they need him, because first of\nall, his perfect German, and his perfect Lithuanian, and perfect Russian, and he was\nalready educated, very cultured person. And beside that, the respect that even those\n\u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the captors had for \u2014 for him, in a certain way, his\nknown \u2014 his name was very, very prominent. So they felt with this respect him \u2014 the\nGermans expressed very big respect for him, although they compelled this council\nto do their dirty work in \u2014 in many cases. But many of those who belonged to the\ncouncil, and then the council instituted a ghetto police. And we had like over a\nhundred police officers. Their whole uniform was only a \u2014 a hat, and a armband\nwhat say, Jewish police. Plus the fact they had to use also the \u2014 the stars, the sameSeptember 22, 1994\nlike everybody else. But these police was very instrumental in \u2014 in many cases, 1n\nmany \u2014 after we were already established in the ghetto, we had a \u2014 most of the\npeople had already a regular \u2014 I mean, some regular job, work, you know, the job\nwas because \u2014 nobody paid for the job. They hardly gave you sufficient food to \u2014\nfor your sustenance, you know. But when \u2014 when \u2014 for instance, myself, I worked\nin the beginning in the flugplatz, that\u2019s an airport. And not only worked, I put in\nextra time, I was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s especially \u2014 you know, it\u2019s strange, you know, you \u2014 you \u2014 when you\ngo back to your country, you go back to the city, which looked when you were very\n\u2014 when you were small, I mean, it looked to you that it\u2019s a fantastic city, because\nyou didn\u2019t know better, you know. When you go back and you see, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nyou walk this same distance that you used to walk on the garden before, it seems to\nyou so small, and so insignificant, you know, it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s pathetic, you know? So I\nremember we used to walk on \u2014 under guard, with loaded rifles like \u2014 like\nsupercriminals and all the \u2014 although there were no cases \u2014 very few cases of\nresistance within the \u2014 within the ghetto, within the \u2014 the \u2014 the establishment. And\nyou \u2014 you call \u2014 you do your work, and you come back after a day\u2019s work, whereby\nyou have guards there, and they constantly changed. In the beginning they had the\n46September 22, 1994\nGerman guards, but then they start to bringing in the \u2014 the [indecipherable] the\nRussian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians. And believe me, these guards,\nthey were incompassionate. They used to beat you up every time you \u2014 you \u2014 you\nhad to \u2014 to work, I mean without \u2014 almost without food, but constantly, and under\nsupervision, and within the cold weather, they \u2014 they used to put a\u2014 a some a\u2014a\nside fire in our work. From time to time you would come and \u2014 and warm up your\nhands, you know, you had the mittens, or the \u2014 but that do \u2014 didn\u2019t mean anything\nnow, because if your body doesn\u2019t have fuel, I mean, you \u2014 you are \u2014 you still cold\n\u2014 it gets colder than in normal, when you have food. And they used to have special\n\u2014 special woods \u2014 wood sticks, which they would beat you up, you know, ev-every\ntime, and without \u2014 without mercy. And every time you used to go to warm up, you\nstayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was\nprohibited to do that in the beginning, but you would do it \u2014 come out, because\nwhen the \u2014 and so my uncle was \u2014 he was a sick man, you know, he \u2014 so I used to\nwork for him, I \u2014 sh \u2014 because there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day,\naround the clock, to work at the airport, because they want to re-re-reestablish the\nairport, and \u2014 in order to be able to use that for their \u2014 for their own \u2014 for their own\nuse, for their \u2014 and life was \u2014 was terrible. Of course, it \u2014 it gradually was in \u2014 in\nchanging. In the beginning it was a ghetto. Then after \u2014 after a while it became aSeptember 22, 1994\nconcentration camp, and we have received the \u2014 before we were under the\nWehrmacht, under the military. Then we \u2014 we came under the jurisdiction of the\nObersturmfiihrer Gecker(ph), and that was the SS. It\u2019s funny now this calls the \u2014\nthe [indecipherable]. So the SS, they were \u2014 they were terrible. They \u2014 they were\nstill much worse than the Wehrmacht, because the Wehrmacht you found\nsometimes between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you\nknow, they\u2019re \u2014 they were \u2014 they were called to \u2014 to duty. But there were still\ncertain aspects of \u2014 of humanity, at one point, you know. But this \u2014 this\n[indecipherable] came in, and then they declared that as a concentration camp. So\nwe came \u2014 we became a\u2014 a-\u2014a-\u2014ina different status, whereby this was right after \u2014\nafter the big aktia(ph), which was October 20\" \u2014 28\", 1941, is when they \u2014 when\nthey came in with loudspeakers and they announced that next morning, five o\u2019clock\nin the morning, after we have in a \u2014 in a special \u2014 a special large place, that\neverybody has to be out. Nobody can stay in the house. Not even the sick people\ncan stay in the house. Everybody has to be out. If they find somebody inside, they\nwill shoot him. So, next morning, everybody came out, and the \u2014 took some food,\nand they \u2014 they said that you take \u2014 if you had some food, take with you, because\nyou\u2019re not going to be provided with any \u2014 any food. So everybody came out, and\nsuddenly a few German trucks came in, and it was \u2014 with guards, and they \u2014 theySeptember 22, 1994\nsurrounded the place, and then the \u2014 the head of the Gestapo that time was a guy by\nthe name of Rauca. Joseph, I think was his name, Rauca, and was a big German, a\nheavyset guy, and they came with dogs, and they started \u2014 they started \u2014 first of all,\nthey searched houses, spot searched, whatever they can find somebody. And they\nas-assured themselves nobody there. They start pulling people to the left and to the\nright. Well, right away we saw that the people that they pulled to the left are mostly\nchildren, elderly people, people who are \u2014 have some blemish, or have some \u2014 some\n\u2014 some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know. And I remember I had a\nlittle coat, you know, was a \u2014 was a fur \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the collar. So \u2014 and it was\na cold \u2014 a cold [indecipherable] was October, it was already winter, basically in the\n\u2014 almost snow was \u2014 we were going to see. There were signs that snow was going\nto fall there. So then, I had my \u2014 my grandmother was with me, and I knew that\nthey are going to call her. So, it was like instinctively, you know, when they pull her\naway. And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to\nsave her, you know, right, yeah, she was still with us for a couple more years\nafterward. But then they \u2014 they took out all those people, and they took them away.\nAnd that was a whole day operation, and we came home. Of course, we understood\nthat they are taking them to a certain special assignment. I would like also to\nmention that the \u2014 the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right \u2014 rightSeptember 22, 1994\nafter the ghetto was closed, we found out in the next few days, that those was the\nfirst 500 people that they took to the\n, and they shot them all. Because their aim and their interest was to \u2014 to get rid of\nthe \u2014 of \u2014 of more intelligent people, or people who are \u2014 who can plan, and who\nwere \u2014 who had certain \u2014 certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to \u2014 to\nget rid of them right away. And \u2014 and then there \u2014 there were \u2014 they were ina\ncertain way right, and they were, in a certain way they have accomplished their \u2014\ntheir \u2014 their doing. Now this time \u2014 that was 500. Now this time, on October 28\",\nthey took them also to the Ninth Fort, and they also shot them, and there were\n10,000 of them. They \u2014 they had \u2014 they were more ready for these 10,000 than for\nthe 500, because they already had excavated. They had \u2014 they had a brigade that\nthey took ahead of time, and they didn\u2019t know what \u2014 that was a \u2014 a small aktion,\nwhich they took about a few dozen people. And their \u2014 their job was to excavate in\nthe vicinity of the Ninth Fort. And fort was large, you know, those forts were\nestablished by the Russians, and they were specially kept for \u2014 for protection of the\ncity. You see, Kovno was surrounded by the Third Fort, the Seventh Fort, the\nNinth Fort. There were like four forts. And they were done by the \u2014 still by the \u2014\nby the Russians. They were at high \u2014 at high levels, and \u2014 and they were \u2014 had a \u2014\nplaces for \u2014 for \u2014 for soldiers, and \u2014 and \u2014 and of course they had places forSeptember 22, 1994\ninmates. So they \u2014 those were the 10,000 that were \u2014 they \u2014 they liquida \u2014 so they\nactually cut by one-third, right away, the ghetto. This was also in conjunction with\nthe burning, and with the \u2014 of the small ghetto. You see, when the ghetto was\ninstituted, they had the large ghetto, and they had the small ghetto. What was the\ndifference? The difference was that one main thoroughfare, one main road, run\nthrough the \u2014 through the ghetto, between the small and the large. And what they\ndid is \u2014 what they \u2014 what they did is they instituted a \u2014 they built a bridge from the\nlarge ghetto to the small ghetto, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was\nalways under military supervision. So the \u2014 the beginning, and this \u2014 in the small\nghetto they had a hospital. There was a hospital that they converted, they have\narranged for that, and they had a hospital with very, very \u2014 we had quite a number\nof doctors, and had quite a number of \u2014 of \u2014 of patients, people who were ill, who\nwere sick, who were \u2014 who were old, who needed \u2014 who needed care, and there\nwere also some women who were pregnant, you know. So this hospital was full to\ncapacity. And one day what they decided is that \u2014 that they felt that \u2014 apparently\nthat they don\u2019t need a hospital, and they don\u2019t need no sick people. So what they did\nis they surrounded the hospital, they surrounded that with haystack around. They\npoured gas. They nailed the doors in the hospital, and they burned \u2014 everybody was\nburned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, including the \u2014 includingSeptember 22, 1994\nthe \u2014 including the pregnant women, including the \u2014 there was such a terrible \u2014 I\nmean, the \u2014 the \u2014 you \u2014 you could smell the \u2014 the \u2014 the stench, you know, the \u2014 the\npeople. And right after that they had the \u2014 the big aktia(ph), and then they \u2014 they\neliminated completely \u2014 this small ghetto was completely, those few people who\nstill were there were evacuated, were passed to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the bigger ghetto,\nbecause it became more room available by \u2014 by eliminating 10,000 people, it was\ntoo much room, you know, basically, based \u2014 based on they \u2014 on their standard. But\nthis was a terrible, terrible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the \u2014 this \u2014 this was\n\u2014 in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know,\nthat\u2019s \u2014 which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain \u2014 for \u2014 like for\nchildren, for \u2014 for \u2014 for \u2014 for babies, and then old people and so on.\nEnd of Tape Three\n52September 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: I have to mention that also, that \u2014 can I go on? Also being in the ghetto was very\ntraumatic, but the chairmans from time to time, they called up Dr. Elkes and they\nsaid, we need hundred people for a special assignment. Nobody knew whether this\nassignment is for real or whether it is to take out and to shoot people, but there were\nsome real assignments. So I remember the Arbeitsamt, which was the place where\nthe \u2014 where the council was, and it was a special building assigned \u2014 it was also a\nplace that had also a jail. Because within the ghetto, there were sometimes found\nsome people who are \u2014 who stole and who did certain acts of \u2014 which was not\npermitted, you know. So I remember that when the police head in \u2014 in the\nArbeitsamt, the \u2014 the council, they had a \u2014 a very difficult task, whom to take out?\nI mean, the chairmans told them we need hundred people. I mean, there were also\ncertain favoritism, which has to \u2014 I mean, happens from time to time, you know,\nbecause if you have a \u2014 if you are a police officer and you have a relat \u2014 a relative\nthat they want him out, I mean, you would \u2014 you would try to protect him rather\nthan somebody you don\u2019t know. So in many cases, it was a very, very difficult job\nfor the \u2014 for the \u2014 for the elderat(ph), for the \u2014 for the council to take. What they\nopted to do is, most of the time, is people who didn\u2019t have families, people who \u2014\nwho didn\u2019t have \u2014 who were not rooted for, for some reason, whom they had someSeptember 22, 1994\ngrievances or some problems with them, problematic, you know. Because many\npeople have just collapsed mentally under this pressure, you know, not everybody\nwas able to be withstand that, you know, because it was \u2014 it was like the game of\nthe cat and \u2014 and the mouse, you know, and it bites off one leg and then the other\none. I mean, it was a constant game, you know, and especially when \u2014 when the \u2014\nwhen the Gestapo used to appear and come into \u2014 to the ghetto. I mean, it was very\ntraumatic. I have also to mention to you is about were \u2014 because it came to my mind\nabout Rauca. I had a personal \u2014 after I finished at the airport, I got myself a good\nbrigade. Mine was good because I worked in a \u2014 for some reason they \u2014 they\nformed a new one and I was at the right time at the right place. They formed a\nbrigade in a marmalade factory \u2014 and this was fantastic, you know \u2014 which had\nlike \u2014 our brigadier was a guy by the name of Motts(ph), who survived incidentally\nthe ghetto [indecipherable] later in Italy. And I was very friendly with \u2014 with him\nand I was able to stick to this brigade after \u2014 especially after the flugplatz, this was\nlike a\u2014a new life. Brigade was \u2014 we had to \u2014 that was a \u2014 a factory of marmalade\nand right next to that was also a place where they used to produce sauerkraut and\nsour pickles \u2014 pickled \u2014 pickled, you know, cucumbers. And at least you had \u2014 you\nwere able to \u2014 to \u2014 to get some food, you know, because sauerkraut and pickles and\nmarmalade, it's already a meal. And plus the fact marmalade is made with sugar andSeptember 22, 1994\nsugar 1s very heavy. I remember they \u2014 they used to \u2014 I was compelled \u2014 I was\npretty strong, you know, and I was compelled to \u2014 to take up bags of hundred kilo\nsugar \u2014 which is 225 pounds \u2014 to the third floor, where the \u2014 where they had the\nmixing of the \u2014 of the marmalade. And sometimes what I used to do is, I used to\npunch a hole in the bag and I had a \u2014 this \u2014 this coat that you see on this \u2014 on this\npicture, on this one. My grandmother had made, like a \u2014 a double \u2014 a double-deck,\nyou know \u2014 a double \u2014 I mean, of the \u2014 the lower part. And \u2014",
        "A: Okay, I had a coat that my grandmother fixed it up in such a fashion that she\nmade like a \u2014 hidden pockets. And when I carried the sugar, I used to punch a hole\nin the \u2014 in the bag and the su \u2014 then \u2014 and make from \u2014 from paper, make like a\nlittle canal, and I used to canal the \u2014 canal the sugar from \u2014 from the bag, directly to\nmy \u2014 to my coat, you know. And this \u2014 this was very, very helpful in a certain way\nto survive because sugar 1s \u2014 1s very nutritious. And \u2014 and in one case, there were \u2014\nwe had a \u2014 a \u2014 a German civilian who was very much connected to the Gestapo.\nOne \u2014 and beside that, what I used to do also, I used to steal marmalade. But the\nonly way to steal that was in \u2014 in \u2014 we had like \u2014 like they have now \u2014 you know,\nthe metal Coca-Cola containers \u2014 using a container. And \u2014 and many times ISeptember 22, 1994\nburned my \u2014 my st \u2014 my \u2014 my stomach because I used to steal that and I used to\ninsert it right here, and then with a coat, I used to close it up. And \u2014 and I used to\npull it out from the ber \u2014 from the na \u2014 I \u2014 I was not able to have accessibility to this\nwhen it was already placed in a cool place, so I had to take that when it was hot.\nAnd this was \u2014 it was sometimes terrible. But notwithstanding that, I felt that the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the pain of the \u2014 of the burning was worth it in order to \u2014 to accomplish the \u2014\nthe \u2014 to accomplish the aim \u2014 you know, the goal.",
        "A: Yeah, that was in \u2014 in my \u20141n my school, where I went, to the gymnasium. I\nhad \u2014 I was sent \u2014 twice, I was sent there for special work, also carrying 225 pounds\nof on to \u2014 also to the top floor. They converted our school to a \u2014 they made it to a \u2014\nto a storage place. And \u2014 and we had to \u2014 we had to do that, and that was \u2014 that was\nbefore that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. About \u2014",
        "A: I \u2014 what I did is, we had to carry these bags of \u2014 they used to take us with the\n56September 22, 1994\ntruck, come to the main entrance, and we used to have to \u2014 to \u2014 about five or six of\nus, go up to the top floor where they had the \u2014 the sugar, and they had the \u2014 had the\npurpose to place that in a high level, that it should not be stolen or something. So\nthey \u2014 we \u2014 we used to carry \u2014 carry them to \u2014 to the cert \u2014 to certain places for \u2014\nfor \u2014 for stirring purposes. And \u2014 but that was not related to the marmalade factory,\nwhich it was a separate \u2014",
        "A: There was a \u2014 there was a military storage for the \u2014 for the German \u2014 for the\nGerman army. And it was not precisely Gestapo, it was a military. Gestapo is \u2014 I\nwas \u2014 I was threatened by this Meyer(ph), when I was in the factory. One day he\ncaught me with \u2014 with this \u2014 with this marmalade, and he just waved his finger and\nsays, next time, you're going to go to the Gestapo if I catch you. It was \u2014 it was\nsomething like that. So he was very generous at that time, you know. He just kicked\nme and that\u2019s all, and took away the \u2014",
        "A: Not \u2014 we were too busy in \u2014 1n \u2014 1n carrying again, and be able to carry the load.\nThat was \u2014 that was \u2014 actually, my mi \u2014 our mind was blanked out at that time. WeSeptember 22, 1994\n\u2014 we were not able even to communicate because they \u2014 they used to \u2014 when \u2014\nwhen it came to a \u2014 to a job like this, it's not like the airport where you had a shovel\nand a\u2014 and a pick and you have to dig and this. You know, this \u2014 this was \u2014 they\nhad to be unloaded in a \u2014 1n a certain time and they \u2014 and you had to \u2014 you had to\nrush. And if you wouldn\u2019t rush, they \u2014 they just clubbed you. So at this \u2014 this\nmoment, you were \u2014 you were just trying to \u2014 to keep up with your strength, in\norder to be able to fulfill the \u2014 ful-fulfill the \u2014 the job. There was also, in \u2014 in cases\nbefore I \u2014 I became \u2014 I start working \u2014 notwithstanding if we worked at this\n[indecipherable] brigade, from time to time, they take \u2014 took us to some other\nplaces. And I have to tell you something which is \u2014 which was very much inscribed\nin my \u2014 in my memory, 1s that [indecipherable] in the \u2014 in 1941, beginning '42,\nthey brought to Lithuania, echelons \u2014 train loads with the boxcars, you know, of\npeople from Austria and from Czechoslovakia and from some other places. And\namazingly \u2014",
        "A: So that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. There\u2019s a very remarkable something that I have to bring it up because\nthere are certain aspects of me being in the \u2014 in the camps that \u2014 that I have toSeptember 22, 1994\nhighlight. And one of them is that this incredible experience that I had. And namely,\nthey start bringing, to the railroad station, echelons \u2014 boxcars with the Jews from\nAustria and Germany. They called that, we found out later, the Hebrew siedlung.\nHebrew siedlung basically means, place from one \u2014 take them from one place and\nput them to other place, in German. And these train came with cars loaded with\npianos, with furniture, with all kinds of luxury items, to make believe to those\npeople, when they \u2014 because you see, when they took out from Germany or from\nAustria, Jews to send them to \u2014 to their \u2014 to their massacre, to their \u2014 I mean, to\ntheir \u2014 to their graves, to their killings, was \u2014 apparently, they had a certain \u2014 a\ncertain \u2014 had to handle it in a certain way. They tried to convince them that they are\nbeing taken to other place, just only to \u2014 they have to take them to \u2014 to \u2014 to other\nplaces. So when they came \u2014 and at that time, I was working for the Gestapo\nbrigade. There was a special brigade which was the Gestapo brigade and many\npeople have tried very hard to work in this brigade, because this brigade was always\nconnected with certain \u2014 certain things that had to do with food. And there was\nmany possibilities to \u2014 to fill up your stomach, you know, to be \u2014 to \u2014 not to be\nhungry. And this time they needed additional \u2014 additional people. So apparently,\nthey took me and they took a \u2014 a group of other people to that task. And I \u2014 and I\nsaw the way this echelons came, and I saw that they came in \u2014 in like, in plush\nSeptember 22, 1994\ntrains. It was not the \u2014 the \u2014 some \u2014 some boxcars came also at the same time, but\nthey came for a \u2014 for \u2014 for a purpose of \u2014 of baggage and \u2014 and some other things.\nBut these trains came with \u2014 and the people with their jewelry, with everything, and\n\u2014and you could see very high standard people who came. And I knew exactly what\nthey are doing with \u2014 what they are going to do with them. Before \u2014 this Rauca\ncame over to us, he pulled out his pistol and we were like, six trucks, six guys, and\nhe said to us \u2014 he said, you see, I forbid you to communicate and to talk to these\npeople. There is no way that you can exchange some words, absolutely nothing. If I\nsee your lips moving, I know that you are trying to tell them something or give \u2014\nsend them a message, so there is going to be nothing else than a bullet through your\nhead. And he just like, took his pistol and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and just scraped our \u2014 our \u2014\nour faces, you know, with that, to \u2014 to \u2014 to impress upon us that he means business,\nyou know. The difficulty was by knowing what \u2014 what\u2019s going to happen to those\npeople. How do we tell them \u2014 or whether \u2014 whether to tell them was the right\nthing, or not to tell them. It was so difficult. Now, our task was to take out from the\nwindows, a German with \u2014 with loudspeaker would say to the \u2014 say to one of the\ncars \u2014 plush cars and say [speaks German]. It means, give me your packs. You\nhave a few kilometers. You have to go a few kilometers, please give out your\npackages because it\u2019s going to be very burdensome and we are going \u2014 pla-placingSeptember 22, 1994\nthese packages in the trucks and we are going to deliver them. And make sure to\ninscribe your names on the packages so we are going to know how to return that to\nyou. I knew that that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s fallacy. I mean, this 1s \u2014 where they are taking them\nis to the Ninth Fort and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s about 10 or 12 miles walking. It\u2019s not a couple of\nkilometers. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to them. And in one case, I saw a\nlady, which I \u2014 pretty young lady, and \u2014 and I really felt \u2014 with her husband, felt \u2014 a\ncouple apparently \u2014 and I felt very bad and I \u2014 I tried to \u2014 to explain to them, to tell\nthem that \u2014 of course, we were already involved in taking the packages, and \u2014 and I\n\u2014I-\u2014TI looked around, I didn\u2019t see Rauca there, apparently he went to have\nsomething to drink or something. And \u2014 and I said to them that, they are taking you\nto your death. Try \u2014 when \u2014 when you \u2014 when \u2014 when you will march, try to \u2014 to\nescape or try to \u2014 to do something or something. You know, the people didn\u2019t\nbelieve me. They just didn\u2019t trust me. They trusted the Germans by that time, but\nthey didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t trust me. They looked at me and looked at me, and they\nlooked at me like I am \u2014 like I am trying to \u2014 and then I \u2014 I \u2014I felt very bad about\nthe fact \u2014 I mean, I\u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I felt scared that they should not \u2014 they should not give\nme \u2014 turn me over, or say that I tried to \u2014 to tell them. This \u2014 this was the \u2014 this was\nthe fanatism. Th-The German \u2014 the German Jews were very big fanatic. They felt\nthat they were first Germans and then Jews. That was their big \u2014 their big problem.September 22, 1994\nThey were \u2014 they \u2014 they eliminated from their prayer books, Jerusalem \u2014 it would\nsay, next year in Jerusalem. They used to put in, next year in Berlin. Th-Th-This \u2014\nthis incident I remember so vividly. And I remember when we took the packages,\nand we took them directly to the Gestapo. And the Gestapo, they had a big \u2014 a big\nwarehouse where they just threw them in one big pile and then they used to have a \u2014\nthose people who worked at the Gestapo used to sort them out and place \u2014 for\ninstance, place different items in \u2014 based on a list that they had, which items have to\ngo here and there. You know, they were very meticulous and very organized. The\nGermans, they were extremely organized. I mean, when it came to organization it\nwas \u2014 I mean, they were leaders 1n the world on that, you know.",
        "A: This was \u2014",
        "A: This was \u2014 I\u2019m not sure, but I think it was in the beginning of the \u2014 of \u201842 or the\nmiddle of \u201842 or something, that it happened at that time, you know, and they \u2014 and\nI know for a fact that they \u2014 they were taken to the Ninth and Seventh Fort and\nthey were \u2014 and they were massacred there, yeah.",
        "A: There were many \u2014 there were \u2014 there were thousands. There a few \u2014 at least,September 22, 1994\nbased on which \u2014 I found out after 5,000 or 6,000. The have even inscriptions in the\nNinth Fort, where they held them for overnight. Many inscribed \u2014 inscribed their\nnames on the walls. And they left certain \u2014 certain \u2014 certain inscriptions, thinking\nthat maybe somebody is going to find and find out.",
        "A: May-Maybe that was \u2014 what was \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 I truthfully \u2014I-\u2014I-",

It\u2019s a \u2014 it was \u2014 the torture was just beyond comprehension.",
        "A: And then, of course, we found out 1941, that in the small cities they took out\neverybody. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t put them in the camps or ghetto or anything, but\nthey took them out and \u2014 and in \u2014 in \u2014 in certain secluded spaces and they made\nthem dig graves and then they \u2014 they shot them there. And there was mostly\nLithuanians have done this, under supervision of the \u2014 of the Germans. I \u2014 I have a\nbook here which is \u2014 describes city by city when it happened and how it happened.September 22, 1994\nAnd it happened to be that my father was one of the eld-eldest in the \u2014 in RokiSkis,\nand \u2014 him and the other one. And he was offered to \u2014 to \u2014 they offered him that he\nwas to \u2014 to give him some harbor \u2014 shelter, you know, harbor him, and at \u2014 himself,\nbut he said, it has to be the whole family. They said, the family we cannot do, you\nyourself. He said no way. Wherever the family goes, I\u2014 I go. And of course,\nafterwards, last \u2014 two years ago I was in Lithuania, and I went to the place that \u2014\nvery secluded small place, a few kilometers from the city where they took there \u2014\nthere were like 2,750 people, children, elderly, and \u2014 which they \u2014 they have\nmassacred \u2014 massacred them there. They kept them for a short time. We had a \u2014 in\nour city we had a little lake, and there was \u2014 there was a count that had his palace\nthere, still from the times \u2014 times [indecipherable]. So in this \u2014 this place, they \u2014\nthey made \u2014 and then he had some stables for horses. So right there they made\ncertain accommodations and they kept there, the people, you know, for \u2014 for a few\ndays and then they took them out to this, three kilometers from the city, the name\nwas Boryar(ph). And you had to go through a narrow path, you know, and there\nwas, like a wooded area and they took them there and there \u2014 there is a \u2014 they have\na monument there, on the \u2014 and they \u2014 they shot them \u2014 all of them there.\n64September 22, 1994",
        "A: Very \u2014 very \u2014 very \u2014 very little information. You know, they \u2014 we were kept\naway from newspapers, from \u2014 but, of course, when we went to \u2014 to \u2014 outside to\nwork in the brigades, we had sometimes opportunities to \u2014 to exchange views with\nsome Lithuanians. We had also a case where I had my cousin Erie(ph) Adoen(ph),\nwhere we worked together. One \u2014 one day they took us to en-ess-ka-ka(ph), that\nwas a\u2014 NSKK, it\u2019s called en-ess-ka-ka(ph) in German \u2014 which they \u2014 they \u2014 that\nwas a\u2014a Special unit, that they took us to \u2014 to cut s \u2014 it was winter. It was snowing.\nIt was \u2014 it was Christmas \u2014 before Christmas eve. And they took us to a place and\nwe had to cut some wood. And it was cold and the \u2014 the guard \u2014 lady \u2014 it was a\nLithuanian lady, she felt pity on us, you know. She owned \u2014 she was a \u2014 a opera\nsinger. And she invited us to come in to warm up and then she gave us a little soup\nand some other things. And then she \u2014 we were reminded, my cousin. She kind of\nblessed us and told us that she hopes that we are going to live through this dark\nchapter and \u2014 and survive. But \u2014 and \u2014 and the guard that was with us was \u2014 also\nwas a -\u2014 this was too, before it became a \u2014 a concentration camp. He was also from\nthe Wehrmacht, and was a very \u2014 very nice guy and was also shivering, you know.\nAt least we were cutting wood and we had \u2014 the blood was flowing through our\nveins and we were a little warm but he had \u2014 he all the time he just patted himself\nnot to \u2014 that was a \u2014 a very \u2014 there are some moments, you know, that you \u2014 youSeptember 22, 1994\nremember, you know, vi-vividly. I remember exactly the house where \u2014 in my back\nmind \u2014 the way where we were, cutting the wood and the way she invited us to the\nhouse and that she \u2014 she had even tears in her eyes, and she said that \u2014 she was very\nhuman, you know, was very much against what \u2014 what \u2014 what was going on and\nhappening. She talked to us in Lithuanian, the guard didn\u2019t understand anyway, so \u2014\nso she was very open. And right away she gave us tea and some \u2014 some soup and\nsome piece of bread. Incidentally, Lithuanian food was very good bread, the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe butter, and all this. We \u2014 Lithuania used to export to England, all kinds of farm\nproducts to \u2014 to England in large numbers. Now, of course, when the Russians\ncame, I mean they \u2014 they took out everything. I mean, they devastated the country.\nThey eliminate many, many \u2014 we have cows in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the thousands, you\nknow, the \u2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Back to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, back to the \u2014 back in ghetto.\nSeptember 22, 1994",
        "A: There were some \u2014 some factories within the ghetto. They were mostly for\nyoungsters and for people who learned a trade. I had, for instance, a teacher of\nmathematics by the name of Faulkman(ph). He was a brilliant, brilliant guy. He\nbecame a shoemaker in the ghetto. And you know, if you had a trade you had more\n\u2014 more possibilities to \u2014 to survive and to \u2014 you know, especially, you know, there\nwere many Germans that used to come in and say, look, my boots are \u2014 fix them \u2014\nand this and that, and \u2014 or my \u2014 need some buttons here, and I need certain things to\n\u2014 to be fixed. And tradespeople were able to \u2014 to fulfill their requirement. Now,\nthere were \u2014 basically the \u2014 the ghetto were stattin(ph), that\u2019s the way they were\ncalled. The ghetto factories were \u2014 basically what they did is they used to \u2014 to\nmanufacture there many items for the army, like, all kind of uniforms \u2014 everything\nfrom uniforms, from hats, from underwear, from \u2014 from boots. And \u2014 and we had\nshoemakers and we had tailors and we had \u2014 we had all kind of tradespeople who\nwere there. We had also something very interesting, which is going to surprise you,\nthat I\u2019m going to tell you. We had a symphony orchestra within the ghetto. We had\npeople who were very talented, extremely talented. They \u2014 they were performing\nsometimes with the permission of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the guards and so forth. We had\nto announce that \u2014 that we\u2019re going to have a concert \u2014 a concert there. There were\npeople \u2014 writers who wrote and who \u2014 and of course, doctors. I could mention to\n67September 22, 1994\nyou now, we didn\u2019t have a hospital, so we made a provisional place where we used\nto take care of sick people, and \u2014 but the word was, don\u2019t get sick if you want to\nsurvive. And that was, don\u2019t get sick if you want to survive. So how can you\nprevent that? Sometimes, you know, with the snow and the bad weather and the\ncolds. But the \u2014 the instinct, you know, the force of wanting to survive was\nsometimes so \u2014 so strong, you know, that is stronger than \u2014 than \u2014 than \u2014 than any\nbacteria or anything. You know, they over \u2014 you can overcome something. And this\nis without food. And I myself, when I used to work in sadiva(ph) \u2014\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: They used to \u2014 we had also, sometimes a influx from people who were\nwandering around, and they didn\u2019t find themselves on the outside. They were being\nharbored by some Lithuanians, but up to a point, they start in jeopardizing their\nlives with the Lithuanians. So in many cases, some of the people came back to the\nghetto. And they \u2014 how did they come back? They infiltrated through the brigades\nthat used to come, they used to sneak in some way, and they used to come in. Now,\nsome of those people, you had to establish them, you had to give them ma \u2014 because\nwe had identification cards. Everyone in the ghetto has a identification. We had to\nfalsify a card, put them in, and some of those people also became employed in the\nghetto estattin(ph) \u2014 in \u2014 in the ghetto factories. They were \u2014 some of them, they\nwere also harboring, in certain cases, sometimes preparing some weaponry, making\n\u2014 making bullets, and other \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 \u201941, we had already a\u2014a guy by the\nname of Jaime(ph) Jellin(ph). Jellin(ph) was a very educated, very intelligent\nyoung man whose family was known for many years. They had a \u2014 they had\nbookstores. And they had \u2014 they were \u2014 they were very, very known in the \u2014 in the\ncommunity as \u2014 as very educated, and \u2014 and very intelligent people. So this\nJellin(ph), who was a really brain, he start forming quietly \u2014 he was in contact with\n69September 22, 1994\na \u2014 you know, when people used to go out to work in the brigades, there were\ncertain contacts, from time to time, with some Lithuanians, and some Jewish people\nwho lived their life like Lithuanians. And through them, through contacts \u2014 which\nin many cases they failed, because you never knew who 1s going to betray you. You\nhad sometimes to have confidence. But there were passwords, and there were some\ncertain ways of \u2014 of protecting yourself, and so they started this movement of\ngetting people out, and \u2014 and getting in \u2014 getting to the woods. There was the \u2014 the\nunderstanding was that the Germans were very much afraid of the woods, because\nthere were \u2014 there was already started a resistance. But you see, there were a douple\n\u2014a double \u2014 a double problem in this respect, because to get out from the ghetto,\nand to reach the woods, you had to cross, and you had to \u2014 to cr \u2014 g-get involved\nwith some \u2014 with some Lithuanians, in \u2014 in many cases, and you really didn\u2019t know\n\u2014 you see, they were not the Germans. The \u2014 the biggest problem were the\nLithuanians, because they know \u2014 they knew the Germans wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t\ndifferentiate a Jew from a Lithuanian, but the Lithuanians did \u2014 did \u2014 did \u2014 did\nknow that. From my \u2014 for instance myself, I \u2014 I had few friends who were by\nthemselves, and they \u2014 they decided they\u2019re going to join the \u2014 the partisans. There\nwas a very good friend of mine, he was the son of the rabbi from Sakiai. Sakiai\nwas a small city in Lithuania. [indecipherable] Golden. There was a other friend,September 22, 1994\nwho now lives in \u2014 [indecipherable] Golden. He has a \u2014 was a terrible \u2014 a terrible\n\u2014a terrible end to this young, brilliant, bright man. He joined the partisans, and in a\nskirmish \u2014 they were some way betrayed in a skirmish. They had a \u2014 they \u2014 they\nhad a fight between them and the \u2014 and \u2014 and the Germans, he was wounded. And\nthey had to amputate his leg. And something happens th \u2014 happened that this is\nvery, very, very \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s sometimes very hard to describe that. Til this day, I\ndon\u2019t know who this was, because they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t say. They were a\nfew of his colleagues. They had to pull a straw who should kill him, because they\nhad to move out from this place and they didn\u2019t want to leave him suffering. So one\n\u2014 one \u2014 one of them pulled the straw and \u2014 and had to pull \u2014 put a bullet in his head,\nbecause they just couldn\u2019t cope with somebody that was wounded, was ha \u2014 that his\nleg had to be amputated, you know. He had gangrene. And this was a \u2014 was a prince\n\u2014 prince of a guy, you know, I remember \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 was very sad, and\n\u2014 but they have a \u2014 I had a number of \u2014 of friends who \u2014 whom I knew exactly\nwhere they are going, and we used to supply them with, from time to time with \u2014\nwith products. And I will explain to you, and that\u2019s the reason why I wanted to tell\nyou the story, what \u2014 what it came \u2014 what \u2014 what I learned to do. I used to \u2014 in\nmany cases, I used to take out the \u2014 my \u2014 take off my stars. I used to go out and \u2014\nand exchange \u2014 I used to have like shirts, or something else, you know, if I didn\u2019tSeptember 22, 1994\nhave, I used to take from somebody else, became some \u2014 something like a \u2014 like a\nbusiness. And then one day, we had our [indecipherable] the factory of the\nmarmalade on one side of the street. On the other side of the street was a company\nby the name of Pieno(ph) Sendris(ph). That was a milk products, I would call it a\nfactory, processing place, where they used to make yogurt, and \u2014 and buttermilk,\nand everything made from milk products. One say, while working in sadiva(ph), at\nbreak time, when we had lunch, I came down to the basement, and then I saw in the\nbasement a \u2014 like a sewer pipe. A large pipe, was maybe 20 some inches of\ndiameter. And then I start putting two and two together. I saw that pipe with\ndirection was toward the street, and I told my f \u2014 one of my friends that I had there\n\u2014 and he happened to be his \u2014 his life as friends. We became sick later, and I \u2014 he\nused to work, and he used to help and was [indecipherable] told him, Louis\nProwther(ph) is his name, he is now an engineer, he lives in Israel. I said, Louis,\nwatch out for me. Let me see what\u2019s on the other end of the pipe. And I climbed in\nand I climbed through the pipe. And when I came out, I came out to the \u2014 to the\nheating place, you know, to the \u2014 you know, where they have the \u2014 the heating\nplace for the \u2014 for the \u2014 for \u2014 for the building of the \u2014 the processing building of \u2014\nyou know, where they had the \u2014 the \u2014 what is that called? A \u2014 they \u2014 they had boiler\nrooms. And \u2014 and the guy, I saw a guy, a Lithuanian guy that was there, he just gotSeptember 22, 1994\n\u2014 got \u2014 got \u2014 got scared when he saw, because for the pipe was there, then I came\nout like from a chimney, you know. I s \u2014 I am sure that he felt that the devil coming\nout there. But then I identified myself, I say I am from \u2014 from the other side, from\nthe sadiva(ph), and I would like to find out what is \u2014 about their products what they\nhave, whether there is a possibility that we can bring in some products of \u2014 milk\nproducts in the ghetto. To make the story short, from that day, I became very\nfriendly with this guy, and I used to bring different items, exchange with him, and I\nused to carry back to the ghetto, all kinds of milk products. And they gave me a\nnickname, they called me Tevye the Milchhiker, you know, from shalo \u2014 from \u2014\nfrom Sholem Aleichem, you know, that, from the \u2014 the famous play, you know,\nTevye the Milkman? That was my na \u2014 I lost my name, I sa \u2014 and from that time I\nused to bring in a lot of \u2014 a lot of products, of milk products.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: All kind of \u2014 all kind of cloth, you know. Shoes or whatev \u2014 whatever, shirts or\nsomething. If I didn\u2019t have myself, I used to trade with somebody. And I was now\nin \u2014 recently to Israel, and Prowther(ph) remembers that, he says \u2014 he remembers\nmy nickname, you know. Prowther(ph), yeah. So this became a \u2014 a \u2014 a new trend,September 22, 1994\nand truthfully, there were many people that were being \u2014 were helped by that, you\nknow, because it was a \u2014 a some \u2014 a product which was \u2014 and this guy used to have\nthat as \u2014 as mu \u2014 as much \u2014 as much as I was able to carry through, you know. In\ncase that they would catch me, and it would spill it out, or they would hit me, or like\nin \u2014 1n this picture, I remember that I \u2014 I had some potatoes that I brought in, and\nthey searched us. But sometimes for five, there were Lithuanian guards. A guy, one\nguy, name was Ratneris(ph), I remember his name. And we \u2014 we knew already, he\nused to take five dollars to come in, when somebody came with certain \u2014 certain\nthings, and he would \u2014 he would look the other way around him, and let you\nthrough, you know. So there were some tolerance, you know, some \u2014 some people.\nLorus(ph) wouldn\u2019t \u2014 would do it \u2014 just search you, and find and \u2014 and beat you up,\nyou know. But that was a \u2014 a incident which \u2014 which happened to me, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right. I used to attach that to my leg with a \u2014 with a piece of \u2014 of cord, and\n\u2014 and slide through, pull it \u2014 pull it in, you know. We made him \u2014 he made for us a\n\u2014a special attachment which shouldn\u2019t be spilled out or anything, you know, that \u2014\nspecial bottles, you know. There were that time, there were now \u2014 no paper cartons,\nso everything was in bottles. The refreshments were in bottles, large bottles like\nthis.September 22, 1994",
        "A: Of course. The \u2014 the only way to \u2014 to communicate, was through this pipe,\nwhich \u2014 whereby through this pipe, I was able to carry through different \u2014 different\nitems, you know, of different products, and especially milk products. And this gave\nme certain fame in th \u2014 in the camp, this \u2014 well, the fame \u2014 nobody looked for fame\nbecause when the word spread too fast, that can be also counterproductive, because\nthey would start watching you, and \u2014 and finding out, and this \u2014 this could mean a\nvery bad end.",
        "A: The ghetto looked like a \u2014 like a little jail, comprised of individual houses and\nbuildings. It looked like a\u2014 a prison, surrounded with barbed wire [indecipherable]\nguards with high lights. It looked like a place of \u2014 a place of no return, I would put\nit this way, because nobody of those beginning 33,000 people \u2014 although everybody\ndreamed \u2014 was getting liberated. But in \u2014 in his deep mind, he knew that this is a \u2014\nthi-this is a\u2014 a\u2014a dream that\u2019s never going to be fulfilled. It \u2014 1t was as \u2014 as time\nwent by, we \u2014 we found ourselves more secluded, more guarded, more \u2014 we \u2014 we\nfound also when \u2014 when the front starts turning \u2014 turned around, and then like\nStalingrad, we f\u2014 we felt that there is a certain additional pressure on us, because\n75September 22, 1994\nthe Germans, they felt already that they are not \u2014 they didn\u2019t accomplish what they\nwanted accomplish in four months, because this winter was for the, like Stalin used\nto say, my best \u2014 the best general, is general winter. Well, this is what devastated\nthe German army. It devastated them to a point, you know, the Germans, they \u2014\nthey were cut clean, shaved, nicely dressed, you know, nice with their uniform, with\ntheir \u2014 with their \u2014 this was a phase. But when they \u2014 when they were encountered\nby him, when they felt this terrible winter, you know, and where they didn\u2019t have\nthe supplies, because partisans, and especially in the beginning, mostly Russian\npartisans have cut off the supplies \u2014 all the supplies line were just shattered. And\nthey were not able to get the supplies, where they had to have their lice, and they\nhad to have their \u2014 their \u2014their flea, and \u2014 and the \u2014 and th-the discomfort, and not\nhave the food in their time, and \u2014 and the rifles were \u2014 I mean, the cold winter was\nso cold their rifles were stuck, you know, they were not able to \u2014 to shoot when they\nhad to shoot. And so they \u2014 they \u2014 they start \u2014 they had different thoughts, and the \u2014\nand the punishment for those people that als \u2014 also in the camps, who were in there\nguarding the camps, was also to send them to the Russian front. The Russian front,\nthe expression to send you to the Russian front was like a sentence of death to a\nGerman soldier. So they were \u2014 an-and when they were in this state of mind, that\nthey saw that things have turned around, they also felt that they have to punish theirSeptember 22, 1994\nwhat \u2014 wer \u2014 wer \u2014 what \u2014 how can they ex-express their \u2014 their frustration, their \u2014\ntheir \u2014 their \u2014 their disappointment? They cannot say anything against their \u2014\nagainst their \u2014 a-against their leadership, because they wouldn\u2019t do that to \u2014 dare to\ndo that. So what they did is they \u2014 they put the biggest squeeze on \u2014 on the\nprisoners. They want to show their leadership that they are better equipped, they are\nbetter \u2014 they know better how to handle, how to \u2014 how to squeeze, and how to\neliminate their \u2014 their prisoners. Their \u2014 this would give them like a \u2014 like a pat on\nthe shoulder, saying you\u2019re doing a good job, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right, yeah. Some \u2014 some tried to escape, but they were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they were \u2014 they were \u2014 legal \u2014 yeah, the legal way, yeah.",
        "A: We had \u2014",
        "A: There were in a certain way, certain routines, like we had \u2014 like I mentioned\nabout the cultural life. We \u2014 we had like meetings whereby we had reading \u2014 beside\n77September 22, 1994\nreading the Torah, reading some scriptures or \u2014 or we had also poems. There were \u2014\nthere were composers, there were people who composed hidden music in ghetto.\nWe had \u2014 we had like hymns, which we chanted when we used to go out and \u2014 and\nwalk, and sometimes we were quietly singing, you know, the \u2014 with \u2014 with\nincredible [indecipherable] with this \u2014 the partisan hymn was created also in \u2014 in \u2014\nin the ghettos, you know [sings partisan hymn] You heard about that \u2014 no, you\ndidn\u2019t hear the partisan hymn? You are missing something.",
        "A: I-",
        "A: I\u2014 the words, I\u2019m not \u2014 not very good in that, you know. I know it was freedom,\nyou know, it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 the hymn is about that our destiny is being written not with \u2014\nnot with bullets from in a gun, which is a Mauser, but with \u2014 with blood. And we\nexpect still to see the sunshine from the coming day, because we \u2014 we don\u2019t know\nwhat the next day 1s going to bring us, but we hope that the next day is going to give\nus a little bit more hope, more \u2014 more \u2014 more a way to survive, and to put\neverything behind us. It was basically that. That\u2019s called the partisan hymn. And of\ncourse, there were some other \u2014 some other songs that were \u2014 they were put\ntogether, and they were \u2014 had many, many times that \u2014 of course, everybody wasSeptember 22, 1994\ntired, and in the few hours, the sleep was \u2014 was essential to \u2014 to be able to get up\nnext morning at five o\u2019clock and \u2014 and \u2014 and go through that there, because we\nwere brought back in ghetto, was already nighttime, so we only had few hours. But\nwithin \u2014 even with \u2014 within this miserable life, we found ourselves certain \u2014 certain\nway of life which \u2014 which was like a shadow of the \u2014 of the normal life, you know,\nit \u2014 it \u2014 it was still \u2014 the hope was always very, very, very big, you know, it\u2019s \u2014\neverybody \u2014 especially when the front turned around, and \u2014 and we saw that the\nGermans are getting nervous, you know, and day by day they went by. Then they\nstarted with the \u2014 the aks \u2014 aktion from the children.",

We \u2014September 22, 1994\ninside the ghetto we hardly had \u2014 only in \u2014 in special cases, we had Lithuanians, or\n\u2014 they were always on the outside, they were \u2014 sometimes, if they had somebody \u2014\nbetrayed somebody, or there was something investigation, they would come in, but\nnormally \u2014 although when they would come in, they would go directly to the\nJudenrat, to Elkes, to meet with them. This was it. They met with them, and \u2014 and\nmost of the time Elkes used to go to the Gestapo and meet with \u2014 with them there,\nto the city, or to Burgermeister, the mayor of the city. But normally, within the\ncity, there was a \u2014 I mean, if you looked \u2014 I mean from \u2014 from the upper part, you\nknow, through a glass cover, and imagine you see the ghetto, you see the whole\nghetto, you would see a \u2014 a life, a going on, you know, a \u2014 almost like a normal life,\nwith \u2014 with every ingredient of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of a normal life, in a certain way. You\nhad every \u2014 you had there \u2014 you had there everything, mostly, except for the food\nwas problematic, but they find, in certain ways, you know, people that went out,\nthey came. Sometimes they overlooked \u2014 not ev \u2014 not all the times, they were very\nharsh on bringing in food. There were sometimes that the Jews have supplied the \u2014\nthe Germans with cigarettes.

        "A: Yeah. There were \u2014 they were constantly, and \u2014 and I found out later that the\naktions were \u2014 it was a \u2014 they were systematic. They used to do that not only in\n[indecipherable], but in every single ghetto that they had. They were exactly the\nsame day, same time, same fashion. This something we found out afterwards,\nbecause it was very organized, very meticulous. Like this day, which was also a\u2014a\nincredible day, it was in \u201943, and that day I didn\u2019t go to work for some reason. You\nsee, my uncle became the \u2014 the head of the parama, of the bread distribution, they\nused to bring in bread and \u2014 and they used to \u2014 considered a very honest person, you\nknow, they \u2014 and of course, he had a few people working for him, and they would\ncome in and \u2014 and get \u2014 the distribution of the bread became something inside \u2014\ninside the ghetto. It was the \u2014 the bread brou \u2014 brought in with horses and \u2014 and\nplatforms, and then they unloaded that, and then \u2014 so, we used to live in the same\nplace, we used to \u2014 we moved from the place that we were, in a place where it was\nemptied out, and Varniu(ph) gatve was this, Varniu(ph) three. And there were theSeptember 22, 1994\ndistribution of the bread, and we lived in the \u2014 in this \u2014 this room there. And we\nwere not too far from the gate. There were like two or three gates for where \u2014 why\nyou \u2014 you would come out and thi-this gate was mostly not for the reason of \u2014 of\ngoing to work, but for the \u2014 for supplies, sometimes, when they brought into the\nghetto. We\u2019re very friendly with the horse people, you know, with this \u2014 with the \u2014\nwith the people who had the \u2014 the horses, were strong, you know, they always were\nvery friendly with my uncle. So, one day they \u2014 when everybody went to work, and\nsome reason I \u2014 I \u2014 I was home and then they \u2014 doing something. I think my uncle\nasked me to stay with him, and d-do something, which I don\u2019t remember exactly.\nSuddenly, the gates opened up from the Varniu(ph) gatve gates, you know, where\nthe supply came in, and a bunch of German \u2014 German buses came in. The windows\nwere \u2014 were blackened, you couldn\u2019t see through the window, you know? And one\nwith the loudspeaker, start announcing that nobody should move til further advice.\nAnd right away they \u2014 oh yes, I forgot to mention, that the same day, a day before,\nthey called \u2014 the Germans, the German Obersturmfihrer called up the \u2014 the head\nof the council, and told him that there is going to come in the \u2014 some German \u2014\nsome German supervisors are going to come in, because there might be a change of\nguard, and they want the police should be neatly dressed, their boots properly\nshining, their uniforms, whatever they were, the armbands, they should be all inSeptember 22, 1994\norder, because they are going to make a check on the police also. And, now going\nback, that the bosses came in to the ghetto with the loudspeaker, and the police were\ncalled \u2014",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Okay. My \u2014 my aunt\u2019s brother, Chaim Levner(ph), he was a police officer.\nNice, awful nice guy. He used to live with us [indecipherable] and we used to live\ntogether. So he was also one of those officers. I mean, they \u2014 they asked for the\nwhole police force to gather, and then when they gathered, the first car that came\nout \u2014 the buses were behind, the first car came out, it\u2019s like a\u2014 a Jeep, and came out\nthree Germans, and this was \u2014 and I was watching through the window what\nhappened, I was inside the house. And they told to the police, they \u2014 to get in \u2014 into\n\u2014 in two lines, one behind the other one, three lines. And three rows\n[indecipherable]. And then they told them \u2014 they asked each of them they should\nmention their name. And right afterward, they told them they should sit down on the\nground, suddenly. So everybody sat down, you know, in this, in this way, you\nknow, crossing \u2014 crossing the leg. My uncle \u2014 my aunt\u2019s brother, for some reason \u2014September 22, 1994\nI mean, apparently he had a feeling that something is wrong there. He gets\nconvulsions, and he was not able to sit down. So the chairman just pulled out the\ngun and just shot him, right there. And I was in \u2014 in \u2014 that was right in front of me,\nin the \u2014 in the window. And then, he was carried away, and then they took all the\npolice, and they put them in \u2014 in the \u2014 in the first \u2014 1n the first bus, everybody,\nincluding the chief, everybody. And right after that, they started the children\u2019s\naktion. Was to take out all the children that were still left, and \u2014 the children and\nthe elderly people. We had in our \u2014 there, where we had the bread supply, we had a\n\u2014a-\u2014a basement. And we were able to bring down my \u2014 my cousin, and place her\nthere, you know. And this was the last time that we were \u2014 that we felt that she\nshould remain in the ghetto, because we felt that \u2014 and th-this day, they took away \u2014\nthey took away all the children. They went from house, to house, and they pulled\nout the children and elderly people, and they took them out. And of course, you\nknow where they took them. Now, when the people came from the brigades home \u2014\nEnd of Tape FiveSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Where \u2014 where \u2014 where \u2014 where in the ghetto, at the children\u2019s aktion, it was\nspecially devised to get out all of the children from the ghetto. And in order to\nimplement that, they had also to take out all the police because this was also \u2014 there\nwere also children from the police officers, and \u2014 and you know how a father would\nreact seeing his child being dragged and beaten and taken to a \u2014 to a bus and then\ntaken away. So after this \u2014 this happened \u2014 and this was very fast, you know, they \u2014\nthey had a big number of \u2014 of gendarmes, of SS people who \u2014 who implemented\nthis function. They went from house to house and they \u2014 they knew exactly which\nhouse had children. They had already a list. Apparently, previously they have \u2014 they\nhave asked for the \u2014 for the composition of the people who lived in the \u2014 in each \u2014\nin each house. You know, it was \u2014 so they \u2014 they had certain records, or somebody\ngave them the records. And they indiscriminately \u2014 I mean, they have \u2014 they have\nwalked into each house, pulled out \u2014 pulled out the children. And most of the\nchildren were \u2014 especially the \u2014 the older ones were \u2014 their mothers were \u2014 were at\nwork at this time. There were only a number of mothers who, when they took the\nchildren, they didn\u2019t want to go with their kids. They wouldn't let them \u2014 let them\nstay with the kids, so they beat them up and they just kicked them and then theySeptember 22, 1994\ntook away the children. And the mothers were devastated. And especially now at \u2014\nat six, seven o'clock, when the people start returning from \u2014 from work, and when\nthey found out this news, it was such a outcry. It was such a tremendous outcry that\n\u2014 that ev \u2014 everybody was crying and everybody was \u2014 was \u2014 was devastated. It was\nsomething that some people throw themse \u2014 threw themself on the \u2014 on the barbed\nwire, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to see whether they just can just get out and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014\nand do something. And people \u2014 really, the mothers didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t care \u2014 care for\ntheir life anymore. They \u2014 they \u2014 they just wanted to join them, to be together with\ntheir \u2014 with their children. And the police officers \u2014 the way we \u2014 we found out\nlater, they were \u2014 they were investigated, to find out whether there are some kids\nwho were hidden, like we were \u2014 we hid the \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin, who was really\nabout, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years. And\nbesides that, they want also to know where \u2014 because they had information at that\ntime \u2014 It was already \u201844 and they knew that there were many, many, many, many\nfreedom fighters who \u2014 who st \u2014 his \u2014 have still a communication with the ghetto,\nand they had apparently \u2014 it was felt that \u2014 also that the police \u2014 certain police\nofficer have helped some, and still helping some of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the freedom\nfighter. So they wanted to find out, and they shot quite a number of police officers.\nThey shot this Greenberg(ph) who \u2014 who \u2014 who was very instrumental. They\n86September 22, 1994\ntortured him and shot him, and he would not divulge, and would not give out where\nthe \u2014 where the hiding places were. And then the rest of those police officers, they \u2014\npart of them \u2014 they returned back \u2014 back to the ghetto, became devastated and found\nalso their \u2014 their children gone. And the \u2014 it was really \u2014 the \u2014 the feeling, I mean,\nwas \u2014 that was so bad, you know, that the \u2014 the whole situation created an\nincredible loss of \u2014 of hope, you know, when you saw something like this. And this\nwas March and it \u2014 it was already when the Russians have advanced already,\nsubstantially towards \u2014 towards the west \u2014 towards \u2014 towards \u2014 they liberated\nalready many, many cities in \u2014 in Russia and they were \u2014 they were moving\ntowards \u2014 towards Lithuania. And that was an episode which is \u2014 which was very,\nvery tragic, you know, very \u2014 even difficult to \u2014 to describe this. This is \u2014\nsometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and \u2014 and we\nexchange \u2014 exchange views. And the \u2014 the \u2014 the question is, between one survivor\nand the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through. I mean,\nthis is \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you see, you are limited in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in being able to\nunderstand it when \u2014 when somebody tells you something, you know, that\u2019s \u2014\nbecause their \u2014 our \u2014 our minds are \u2014 are in a certain way limited. We cannot\nunderstand beyond this limit, you know. And it is, how can somebody describe\ncertain things that like? How can somebody describe that a German SS man takes a\n87September 22, 1994\nchild of a year old, takes him by his legs and smashes him with his head against \u2014\nagainst a wall? I mean, how can \u2014 I mean, this is \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not even \u2014 even in\nthe most substandard countries, I mean, it\u2019s happening, you know. They \u2014 they kill\npeople, they massacre people, but \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 and\nit\u2019s hard to describe and it\u2019s hard to believe. Sometimes I myself, it\u2019s hard for me to\nbelieve that \u2014 that \u2014 it looks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly\nhappened, you know. An-And \u2014 and time was going so slow, you know. The \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t even mention some other work that I used to do, you know. They took us to\nthe \u2014 to the army barracks in \u2014 sometimes and we had to clean out latrines and\nsomething else, you know, they \u2014 and some \u2014 sometimes they took some people and\nthey just threw them into the latrine, I know, just only to \u2014 to have a little pastime\nfor themselves, you know. So I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s beyond \u2014 beyond description.\nSo that\u2019s \u2014 so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we meet together with survivors\nsometimes, and we share experiences, we \u2014 we \u2014 we can understand it much better\nthan \u2014 than \u2014 than explaining that to the outer world, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 and it\u2019s\nvery hard to believe that a country so advanced, you know, was \u2014 was get \u2014 getting\nchildren and then [indecipherable] and all this. That were \u2014 that were able \u2014\nthat wer \u2014 came down to a level, to such a level, to \u2014 to \u2014 to be so destructive and soSeptember 22, 1994\nwithout hearts, without \u2014 so the ghetto was \u2014 th-this was a \u2014 at that \u2014 at that stage, it\nwas already a camp, yeah. Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot\nkeep our \u2014 my uncle decided that he cannot keep anymore his daughter there. So we\nmade contact through a \u2014 there was a rabbi\u2019s wife, Shuman(ph) was her name. And\nI\u2019m sure that she \u2014 she is going to surface in some of your \u2014 some of the places. She\nwas a \u2014 an incredible lady. She was a rabbi\u2019s wife. Her husband was in Israel \u2014 in\nPalestine already. And she \u2014 some way he left before that. And she was\nmatchmaking. She was out \u2014 without the \u2014 without the \u2014 the stars. She was going\naround and finding places to harbor children. So some \u2014 somebody told us about her\nand we were in \u2014 contacted her, and \u2014 and she found a place for Sulami(ph), which\nwas my \u2014 my \u2014 my cousin. She was three and a half, or four years old at that time.\nMy \u2014 my aunt laughs always, she says that I\u2014 I \u2014 I used to have an incredible\nappetite, you know. And I used to watch, you know \u2014 she used to give her \u2014\nsometimes we were able to smuggle in tapioca. You know what is? It\u2019s a\u2014 and I\nused to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it\nwould be left over for me to eat. So she always \u2014 so we decided to do \u2014 how would\n\u2014 we would do that. At that time, we had two SS people in the ghetto. One name\nwas Fiffiger(ph) and the other name was \u2014 what was the other name? It will come\nto me pretty soon. Yeah, it\u2019s [indecipherable] Fiffiger(ph) was a former teacherSeptember 22, 1994\nand he was \u2014 very much befriended my uncle. He was very nice. He was a SS, and\nhe told the story that he was forced into the SS. And he \u2014 he expressed very good\nsentiments. So my uncle had to put his confidence \u2014 he showed in \u2014 in few cases, he\nshowed that he was \u2014 he was helpful. And we could see that he is not one of these \u2014\none of these beasts, you know. So my uncle explained to him and \u2014 and he knew\nthat we are having the child there, and \u2014 against all odds, and he promised my uncle\nthat he is going to help him out. This was a remarkable \u2014 but his comrade, his\nfriend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite. Just the opposite. What he did\nonce was also beyond \u2014 he encouraged people \u2014 he opened up the \u2014 he opened up\nth-this \u2014 anyway, first, let me finish with Fiffiger(ph). So they arranged that the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the bread was coming in twice a week with these big platforms, and then the\nhorses with a driver were going out. So we arranged to \u2014 I gave her the sleeping\npill. We put her in a bag because they \u2014 it used to come in bags. So we put her in\none of the bags. And we put her under a big \u2014 so they \u2014 she can go through the \u2014\nthrough the gates. Because the gates, they always used to stick something to find\nwhere there\u2019s sometimes hide. But it was already prearranged, you know, that\napparently he \u2014 he \u2014 he did that \u2014 Fiffiger(ph) did that, you know. And we were\nable to get her out and she was given away to \u2014 to a very nice Lithuanian family.\nThey took care \u2014 they even baptized her and made her like a part of the \u2014 and sheSeptember 22, 1994\nspoke only Lithuanian and she was \u2014 she fortunately survived. In exchange, my\nuncle \u2014 the police officer who was shot, his little boy was also given out to\nsomebody. But he was betrayed and they killed him. Apparently, this Lithuanian\nthat took him was given \u2014 were given certain things in order to do that. They\nbetrayed him and he was \u2014 and we found out later that he was \u2014 he was killed. So \u2014",
        "A: Let me just finish with the \u2014 it will come back, the name of the other guy, you\nknow. He was a bad, bad \u2014I should have written down. Yeah, so he \u2014 what he \u2014 he\nformed \u2014 it was already March, April \u2014 it was already \u2014 the ghetto already knew\nthat it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s still a\u2014 a\u2014a-\u2014a little bit of hope on the horizon. So he let out\nthe word that he is going to \u2014 that he 1s going to let out some people to escape. And\nhe opened up a-\u2014 a hole in \u2014 was in the fence. And needless to say, he was with a\nmachine gun there, and he killed like 14 people there, claiming that they tried to\nescape. So that was SS. Sturmfihrer. [break]",
        "A: You want I should tell also about the escape, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, towards the end of the 1943, we s \u2014 we saw certain movements in aSeptember 22, 1994\ndifferent direction. We \u2014 we felt that there is some kind of changes going to be\nimplemented in the ghetto. And we really didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t know exactly. We felt that\nthe guards were changed. We have \u2014 we have seen more \u2014 that was also a time\nwhen we have seen more Hungarians. They brought in Hungarians, and especially\nsome truck drivers. One \u2014 one of them, which I knew pretty well, he was a very bad\nmouth, and \u2014 but he was not \u2014 not so bad. But the rest were very bad. He was\nHaymushi(ph). He was a Hungarian truck driver who \u2014 who worked very close\nwith \u2014 with Pilgrim(ph) and \u2014 and Fiffiger(ph). He was, like, always with them.\nAnd we felt that by bringing in this nationalist, and by trying to put in more\nrestrictions, and \u2014 and start \u2014 they started also watching more of the \u2014 all the\nmovements and what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happening in the ghetto. And they were\nvery much concerned and very much were \u2014 were looking for \u2014 for some kind of\nsupplies that the ghetto would supply, or the ghetto would produce, or the ghetto\nwould have some contacts with \u2014 with the \u2014 with the freedom fighters. So in order\nto have a tighter watch, they \u2014 they have also tried to squeeze out from the police\nand see whether their police \u2014 to find within the police also some people who\nwould \u2014 who would be on \u2014 on their side. They were not \u2014 were not too much able\nto \u2014 they had not been able to get from the \u2014 from the Jewish police, except in \u2014 in\nisolated case \u2014 cases, because the police was well aware of what \u2014 what wasSeptember 22, 1994\nhappening. And they \u2014 they themselves \u2014 the ghetto was the \u2014 with the council in\nmany occasions \u2014 and many cases have tried to help. And they were \u2014 they knew\nalso sometimes the whereabouts of \u2014 of people who \u2014 who would go out to the\nforest an-and fight and in different measures and acts of terrorism and \u2014 and\nblowing up railroads, and sh \u2014 cutting off supplies, and \u2014 and shooting in many\ncases, in back of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the Germans. Although the Germans themselves,\nlike \u2014 the Germans themselves, they \u2014 they \u2014 most of the time didn\u2019t dare to invade\nthe forest, because the forest was for them, taboo. But they used for that purpose,\nthey used Lithuanians, in many cases, to \u2014 to find out and to find out the right spots\nand then they would \u2014 they would be able to \u2014 to move in. We also saw the \u2014 not\nonly by \u2014 by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we \u2014 we have felt a\nbigger presence in the ghetto of \u2014 of the military. Because normally, in all those\nyears, they were \u2014 they were, most of the times, guar-guarding the ghetto from the\noutside and they were hardly \u2014 not too frequently, they \u2014 they used to come in and \u2014\nand \u2014 and look for themselves, look in in certain aspects of the ghetto. Now, in the\nlate \u201843, we have \u2014 we had a\u2014 a much bigger presence. There were also a repetition\nof \u2014 of people that \u2014 of requirements for \u2014 for labor force in some other \u2014 other\nplaces within Lithuania and \u2014 and outside of Lithuania, whereby they used to\ncome and \u2014 and of course, make a selection, or they used to appeal to the \u2014 to theSeptember 22, 1994\ncouncil in order to provide them with \u2014 with \u2014 with those elements who can be\nuseful for them. And most of the times, they \u2014 they \u2014 some of the times they also\ntried to get some people who \u2014 who had some skills, and tried to use them in the\nbest of their \u2014 their ability. We have seen also that factories, in the \u2014 the\nverstattin(ph) have been over swamped with \u2014 with additional work. As the front\nwas getting closer, there were more requirements and more necessities to \u2014 for \u2014 for\n\u2014 for the Germans, for their supplies, and they needed the \u2014 the help and the \u2014 and\nthe cooperation of this verstattin(ph), so they used to work overtime. I mean,\ninstead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know. And they also\nimplemented some shifts in that time. The \u2014 the underground movement grew faster\nand faster. They \u2014 they had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians\nby themselves also were not dumb. They saw that the tide is changing. So they, in\nmany cases, they tried to befriend, and \u2014 and to be a little bit more helpful.\nAlthough, the \u2014 the same orders still persisted that if they catch somebody that they\nwould have a [indecipherable]. But we have seen that they \u2014 they were more\naggressive in \u2014 in hiding people and in helping and \u2014 and in trying to make up for\nthe \u2014 for the damages that they have done before. When the \u2014 in 1944, after the \u2014\nafter the children\u2019s aktion, and after we have \u2014 we have brought out our \u2014 my\ncousin from \u2014 from the ghetto, I myself started thinking of terms of \u2014 of getting\n94September 22, 1994\naway. I was in contact 1n two cases, in two ca \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm. The guards, and \u2014 and more frequently coming into the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the\nghetto. I didn't see, really a \u2014 I mean, they were as brutal as they used to be because\nthis \u2014 especially the \u2014 the \u2014 the foreigners \u2014 the Hungarians, they were not \u2014 they\nwere not good people, you know that \u2014 especially there. They were \u2014 they were as\nbrutal as they are, maybe some \u2014 some \u2014 some more than \u2014 than the others in \u2014 in\nmany, many occasions. This [indecipherable] the truck driver, I mean, he\nwas [indecipherable] that time when I \u2014 I mentioned about letting \u2014 deceiving the\npeople and telling them they can escape and so forth and so on, because people have\nstarted feeling there, the air has changed, in the sense that the front was getting\ncloser and closer. And the question was when and how fast. At the same time, they\nstarted getting preparations for \u2014 for \u2014 to liquidate the ghetto. Apparently this was\nmentioned in \u2014 in a \u2014 in few occasions that \u2014 that pretty soon they have already\norders in place in order to eliminate the ghetto, and to \u2014 and to take out all those\nremains of the \u2014 of the people. At that time, I think \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure that in the\nghetto were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now \u2014 maybe now\nfrom 33,000 that originally \u2014 so what they did is also \u2014 when \u2014 when they \u2014 whenSeptember 22, 1994\nthey used to \u2014 when the ghetto became smaller \u2014 small-smaller in \u2014 1n \u2014 in\npopulation, they also start cutting off smaller in territory. What they did is, where\nwe had the Varniu(ph) gatve where the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the [indecipherable] was\nthe gate for the supplies, there was a \u2014 a\u2014 a number of houses that one day they\ncame in and they took a \u2014 a\u2014a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove\nthe fence that was the original fence. What they did is, they put in another fence,\ncutting off, like, four or five blocks from the \u2014 from the original one. So it became\nlike a ghetto within a ghetto, you know. This was, in a certain way, to my personal\nadvantage, you know, because \u2014 and maybe some others, which I \u2014 I \u2014 I do \u2014I don\u2019t\nknow. I can speak for myself on it. What they did is, actually by \u2014 by putting a new\nfence and putting guards \u2014 putting guards around this fence, they have diminished\nthe guards from the overall fence, which was before, even without taking off. So,\nwhat happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided \u2014 I have a\u2014 had a\n\u2014 we were five \u2014 five people that we decided to \u2014 to flee the camp. We saw that \u2014\nalready that the time is running out. I spoke to \u2014 three times to one friend of mine\nthat was in the \u2014 was in the \u2014 in the partisans. And he told me that whenever I want\nto join them I should \u2014 I should contact somebody, and \u2014 1n order to join them. The\nonly thing 1s, after that I tried to get the \u2014 the other \u2014 th-the contact man and he was\nalready gone, also. So I went to my \u2014 where my uncle was and I told him, look, I\n96September 22, 1994\nthink that it\u2019s no \u2014 no reason for me to remain here. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re\nclose. We\u2019re very close to the end. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 they are going \u2014 one of these days,\nwe are going to get up and we\u2019re going to find ourselves surrounded by \u2014 by trucks\nand they are \u2014 they are just going to take us, and \u2014 and \u2014 and ta-take us out and \u2014\nand take us to camps, or take us somewhere else, or \u2014 or \u2014 or take us to the Ninth\nFort. So my uncle, who was very conservative always \u2014 and he really was very\nclose to me, was \u2014 was like \u2014 like a father to me, you know. And th-this was maybe\none of reasons that \u2014 that I have not left the place sooner. And especially my\ngrandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she [indecipherable] that time\nwhen I saved her, you know, she \u2014 she would not \u2014 and we knew that she \u2014 she \u2014\nalso \u2014 also survived, you know, the \u2014 the children\u2019s aktion that time also when \u2014\nbecause she was with a child inside, but her, we couldn\u2019t get \u2014 get her out, because\nwell, it would be too \u2014 too difficult, you know. A child is something that \u2014 el-else.\nSo what \u2014 so my uncle came to the conclusion, say that\u2019s fine and gave me his\nblessing, I mean, it \u2014 and I deciding to \u2014 now, how are we going to do it? SoI-\u2014I\ndevised a plan, in other word, the houses which were behind the first \u2014 the general\nfence, a few houses still left. They have \u2014 normally, in many cases they would\nexplode some of the houses. They would put in some dynamite and explode it.\nHere, they \u2014 they have \u2014 and \u2014 and they did it later on with the r\u2014 with the \u2014 withSeptember 22, 1994\nthe rest of the ghetto. So I had a \u2014I had three more people with me \u2014 three \u2014 four.\nThere was one \u2014 one guy that was himself from Poland and for \u2014 some way he was\nstuck in \u2014 in \u2014 in Kovno, and never was able to get out. And then it was the nephew\nof \u2014 the nephew of my aunt, who is now in Charlotte, North Carolina. And then\nthe other one was a guy that used to \u2014 frequently to come to our house. And then it\nwas the other fellow that worked also with \u2014 was a nephew of somebody who\nworked with my \u2014 with my uncle. So, then this guy knew \u2014 supposedly he knew the\nroad, how to \u2014 I mean, where to go in order to get to the forest.",
        "A: The forest was \u2014 what \u2014 yeah, okay.",
        "A: Okay. I'll make that sh-short, you know. Okay. We were five, we have\naccumulated some supplies in one of the houses. And one day when we came back\nfrom work, we have \u2014 we \u2014 we just defected from the \u2014 from \u2014 from the group,\nwhich was large group, when we came back from work. And we went into this\nhouse and then we watched the out guard \u2014 the outside guard \u2014 we had also special\npliers to cut \u2014 to cut the wire. We have \u2014 wait til the night. On that third day, we\ncut through \u2014 in our supplies what we had was water, sugar, and bread. We \u2014 we\nwatched \u2014 we timed the guards that was walking, we cut through the wires, and we\n98September 22, 1994\njust came out. And we \u2014 it was nighttime and we were not able to go too far because\nnight \u2014 nighttime, it was \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was very dangerous to go, because you\u2019re\nable \u2014 I mean, they would stop you and then right away there, you would be\nfinished. So we hid in a \u2014 in a \u2014 next to a house in the garden, where it was dense\nbushes and we stayed there for \u2014 for a \u2014 for the night. And then early morning, we\nleft and we went towards the woods \u2014 towards the woods which was Janava. That\nwas a\u2014a place where there were al \u2014 there already some partisans were \u2014 were\nworking \u2014 were working in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the exploding some supplies \u2014\nsome supplies for the Germans and so on. Okay. We had to go through to a \u2014\nthrough a main highway. And when we walked, we walked like in one behind the\nother one. So when we reached the highway \u2014 and this was during the daytime\nalready, a guy with a \u2014 with a bicycle and was dressed 1n \u2014 in civilian but with a\nrifle, was there waiting for us. And when we approached him, I mean, he took off\nthe rifle and he said, your documents. Okay. We start running in different\ndirections. This was outside the city, you know, it was a big field of potatoes and \u2014\nand corn. So \u2014\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: The details, I have no knowledge of the details.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Towards the beginning of \u201844, we have seen with a \u2014 with a change also, the\nstatus of the ghetto \u2014 from the ghetto to a concentration camp. We felt a new \u2014 a\nnew arrangements and \u2014 and some things \u2014 certain things \u2014 certain changes which\nwe \u2014 it was not too hard for us to figure out. We saw that the handwriting on the\nwall. We saw that everything what\u2019s happening with the Russian army, the\nvictorious expelling, pushing the Germans towards \u2014 towards the \u2014 towards the\n100September 22, 1994\nwest. And we felt also that there is time for \u2014 for me and for some friends to \u2014 to get\nout and get out as soon as possible because every \u2014 every day was a matter that \u2014\nwe knew exactly that \u2014 what our fate was going to be. So truthfully, we didn't have\ntoo much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would \u2014 we would\nnot be able to survive. So I went to see my uncle and I told him that \u2014 and my\ngrandmother, I told them that I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m ready, with \u2014 with my other fellow \u2014\nfellow friends to \u2014 to get out, and to get out as fast. So my uncle I \u2014 my uncle also\ngave me a\u2014 he had like a little golden coin and he gave this to me and he said, look,\nin case of necessity or something, I mean, you \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he had like three of them,\nyou know, so he was hiding that always in \u2014 somewhere. So when \u2014 soon I got\ntogether with my \u2014 with my friends and when we went to work, coming back we\njust evaded the guards and we came into one of the houses that we marked for \u2014 for\nour shelter in \u2014 in \u2014 in between, in order to be able to \u2014 to plan our \u2014 our escape.\nThe \u2014 one of my friends was much younger than us, a couple of years, and he was a\nshort one, and we used him as the outlook. So he used to look and to watch. And he\nwas the one that timed the steps of the \u2014 of the guard on the outside of the fence,\nand then came to the conclusion. He gave us the signal, we came out, we cut\nthrough the wires and that was nighttime. And we just slipped out, all of us.\nBecause we \u2014 really the security was behind us in the \u2014 in the smaller ghetto whereSeptember 22, 1994\nthere was double-rolled barbed wire. This was all \u2014 this was a old fence which they\nhave never tried to repair because they were \u2014 there was \u2014 the ghetto was in the\nghetto, you know. Now, when we had to \u2014 we slept over there in a\u2014ina\u2014ina\ngarden, a dense garden. And in the morning we start going. But we left a distance\nbetween ourselves. Rather than walking in a group, we walked, like, one by one,\nsome meters, one behind the other one. When we came through a \u2014 through a \u2014 with\na bo \u2014 to a place where we had to cross the highway, there was one person with a \u2014\nwith a bicycle, and a rifle on his shoulder, a Lithuanian. And suddenly he came out\nand approached us, say, stop, documents. Raise your hands. So when he did that, we\nstart running in different directions. It was only one person and we knew that he\nmight shoot one but he cannot shoot everybody, you know. Besides that, his aim\nwas not too good because I felt \u2014 when I run, I felt like, a couple bullets passing me\nand then I don't know. I \u2014I\u2014 I really ran like never in my life, and then I threw\nmyself in the cornfield. I know also that later on when I was laying there for quite a\nwhile, I know that they \u2014 they had some \u2014 some people with horses try to locate\nsomebody, and I hoped that they are not going to find anybody. But I, during\nnighttime I walked about additional half a mile and I saw ble \u2014 flickering lights.\nAnd I say to myself, without these \u2014 would that be headquarter \u2014 would \u2014 would\nthat be quarters for the Germans or some barracks or something? Then I steppedSeptember 22, 1994\naway and I found myself close to a small, small woods. And there I slept over the\nnight. It was really \u2014 it was a little bit cold nighttime, but I covered myself with\nleaves and some other things. And there was a little \u2014 a little \u2014 I wouldn't say a\nriver, but it was little place with \u2014 with water. And then I \u2014 I was hiding behind the\nbushes. In the morning, I heard some voices 1n Russian, and I \u2014 I watched that, and\nI saw that there \u2014 there, a woman came and she \u2014 apparently two friends, but one\nstayed with a \u2014 with a metal thing, you know, what they \u2014 they put here \u2014 put in\ncloth. And she started washing right there in this \u2014 where there was li \u2014 this was not\neven like a river, but it was a place that I remember that I had drunk water. I had my\nhat, so with my hat I used to take and \u2014 and \u2014 and drink the water. Because food\nwas nothing. I \u2014 I used to collect some \u2014 some berries, you know, from wild berries,\nand this was my food. So I was desperate. I was very hungry and this woman was\nwashing and I said to myself, let me \u2014 let me approach her. And I spoke perfect\nRussian, of course. So I came out. I said, look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m escapee, and like you\nshould help me with some food. So I was not sure whether she was going to go \u2014\nfirst of all, I didn\u2019t know. I asked her what was there in this \u2014 in this place, where I\nsaw the flickering lights in the night. And she said, no, that\u2019s a camp, a civilian ca-\ncamp for civilian Russians. An intern camp for civilian Russians. But then she told\nme that she is going to come back and bring me some food. And I \u2014 I thought toSeptember 22, 1994\nmyself, I prayed, I said, or she is going to bring me food, or she is going to bring me\na German who is going to \u2014 to kill me? About 15 minutes later she comes back with\na bottle of milk and a piece of spee(ph) \u2014 you know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s from \u2014 it\u2019s like\nmeat, fat meat, you know \u2014 and a piece of bread. And then I started talking to her\nand she said to me that she got scared when she saw me, because I looked like I\u2019m\nan old, you know, the \u2014 and I explained to her that I\u2019m a refugee, and so forth. And\nso she said to me, look, we have in our camp two Russian prisoners who \u2014 who fled,\nand who are hiding in our \u2014 in this \u2014 in this camp. And they also are going to \u2014 they\nare planning to go to join the \u2014 the freedom fighters, the partisans. And where they\nare going? They are going to Janava, Janava, Belder(ph), that used to be Janava,\nthe forest of Janava, which was not too far away from there. And this guy\nScheiker(ph), that was with me, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was leaving us, and he told us, and he\nexplained to me, because he himself was from Janava, and he told us \u2014 he gave me\ncertain \u2014 certain parameters. But now, I mean, he was \u2014 he was gone, so I had to do\nthat myself. So then, in the \u2014 in the evening, sh-sh \u2014 the two Russians came over.\nThey had knives for themselves, and they asked me a few questions, and they\nwanted to verify whether I am legit and I shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 I shouldn't be some \u2014 the\nbay \u2014 betray them. And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went to the\nwoods, we approached them, and one of them had apparently a contact, or he knew\n104September 22, 1994\nexactly a certain spot. First of all, th-the Russian prisoners were not treated very\nfriendly by the Russians, because Stalin\u2019s \u2014 Stalin\u2019s view was that the Russians\nshould never fell in a prisoner life, I mean, he should give his life for the country.\nBut of course, this \u2014 that was not the case. So he took us to the forms \u2014 forest at one\npoint and he \u2014 then we met about three or four more guys there. They were from\nthe \u2014 from \u2014 apparently also, they were former Russian prisoners. And they had\nalready a plan, a top \u2014 topographic plan, and they had all rolls. So they said that\nthey have received some supplies from \u2014 from parachutes that they \u2014 and they had\nsome assignment to watch and to see whether some German forces are going \u2014 if\nthey are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do\ncertain sabotage \u2014 sabotage work. We spent about, I would say, maybe about close\nto 20 days moving around from one spot to the other one, because we didn\u2019t want to\nstay in one spot. And on few occasions \u2014 I was not trained, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nanything about \u2014 about ammunition or anything. They have done, basically, the\nwork. And the \u2014 in \u2014 in different cases, I was the look out. They used me to be the\nlook out. They had some \u2014 some light arms and knives basically, and they had some\nback packs with \u2014 with ammunition. We spent, I would say, about four weeks. And\none \u2014 one day, we heard a movement. We put our ears \u2014 normally, what we used to\ndo is, we used to put our ears to the grounds, so we can detect \u2014 that\u2019s a way of\n105September 22, 1994\ndetect whether there is some heavy movements. And here we detected that some \u2014\nbased on our imaginations, some tanks. And now we saw about three or four\nGerman tanks rolling not too far away, you know. And then about a couple hours\nlater, we heard some shootings, and an exchange of fire. And this whole\nneighborhood vicinity became like a \u2014 like a \u2014 like a military, I mean, hell. Because\nbullets and flying out the \u2014 in the shrubs, and saw burning \u2014 burning bushes and all\nthis, you know. It was an incredible, incredible exchange of fire. Then, it lasted for\nabout an hour, an hour and a half, and it looked to me that it lasted forever, you\nknow. Because we found ourselves in the middle and we said to ourselves, now we\nare going to be killed by \u2014 by friendly \u2014 by friendly \u2014 our friendly power \u2014 gun\npower. Suddenly, it quietened down. It was quiet like nothing \u2014 I mean, like \u2014 like\nnothing ever \u2014 anything happened, you know. And I say to the \u2014 to one of Russians,\nI say, what \u2014 what would that be? I mean it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s too quiet, I mean, we got used\nalready to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the incredible sound of \u2014 of \u2014 of explosions, you\nknow. And then suddenly we heard again, we put \u2014 the Russian put his \u2014 he put his\near on the ground. He said, something is happening. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s quite apparently, but\nsomething is happening. And, like 45 minutes later, we heard \u2014 we heard some\nmovement of, like, troops. Not too many. And then we saw the first Russians\napproaching us. And the first question was \u2014 the first question was, have you seen\n106September 22, 1994\nsome tanks? I sort of, yeah, we saw quite a few hours ago. And he said, no, these\ntanks already finished. Have you seen some other tanks? And we say, no. Right\naway it was \u2014 I was amazed, you know, because right away I \u2014 I was approached by\n\u2014 by one of the lieutenants. I think it was a captain, not a lieutenant \u2014 captain,\nbecause he had three stars, yeah. It was a captain, and he \u2014 he actually told me\nthat \u2014 he looked at me and looked at me and says, are you Jewish? I say yes. So am\nI, he said. Okay, we embraced each other and he \u2014 right away what he did is, he told\nus \u2014 he said, look, this is the front line, and the line might change, because we don\u2019t\nknow what \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 what is ha \u2014 what can \u2014 what is going to happen a few\nkilometers from here. My advice is, and what I want to see you, is to the till. Till 1s\ntowards the back, towards the [indecipherable], you know, towards the back, you\nknow. And right away, he called a\u2014 a\u2014a soldier and he said, take these guys and\ntake them over. And \u2014 and in meantime, we was already approaching some Jeeps\nand some \u2014 some other \u2014 some other military units. And he told us to move as far as\npossible towards the back. He said, you went through already, it\u2019s sufficient. I\nmean, it\u2019s \u2014 and th-this was the \u2014 this was actually the \u2014 the \u2014 the way that we \u2014 so\nhappy. I mean, the first time we felt like \u2014 felt like liberated, you know. And then he\nasked me \u2014 another guy that he referred me to ask me some question. He said me\nwhether I want to join the army, or I want to do. I said, no, no, first what I want toSeptember 22, 1994\ndo is, I want to go \u2014 I want to see \u2014 because my question was, how soon are they\ngoing to liberate Kaunas? He said, that might take still a few days or \u2014 or it might\nstill take some \u2014 some time. So we were with the army for about \u2014 I think about ten\nor 15 days til they have to [indecipherable] Kaunas and to liberate it. I went right\naway to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to the ghetto. The ghetto was exploded. Everything, all the\nhouses were exploded. They have \u2014 some people came out from the hiding in some\nplaces. Some people came out from hiding. I went to this place where we were\nhiding and we had some photographs and I found some photographs. But supplies\nand other things that we had in \u2014 in our \u2014 in our house, and in the ground was\nnothing. It was like, everything burned. And right away I went to \u2014 to Kaunas. This\nwas Slobodka. I went to Kaunas, I got myself \u2014 right away I met with this officer,\nthat he told me that he is going to \u2014 he is \u2014 I mean, that he 1s going to be coming to\nKaunas, and he gave me a number where I can \u2014 I can reach him. And he told me\nthat if I have some \u2014 some kind of desire of some \u2014 something. I said, yeah, I would\nlike to have \u2014 I have some \u2014 I have some relatives here, and I would like to see\nwhether I can find them. Where \u2014 where are there \u2014 I\u2014 I am sure \u2014 I felt they were\nvery optimistic. I said maybe there are some relatives that I have. And I start\nfloundering around for quite a few days. And then I found a family, that we were\ntogether in the ghetto and then later, they went to Canada. But I used to send themSeptember 22, 1994\npackages when I was in there \u2014 when \u2014 just a minute \u2014 that I send them packages\nafter, when I \u2014 when I \u2014 when I was in the army. They \u2014 I helped them to find a\nplace \u2014 a living place because the \u2014 the city was \u2014 was devastated, you know. There\n\u2014 there was not too many \u2014 too big fights in the city, but it was many have escaped\nand left behind themselves apartments with furniture, and you know, like \u2014 the\nsame way like when the \u2014 when the \u2014 when the Germans came in. So right away I\nfound a\u2014a friend of mine, who told me that if I would like to serve \u2014 to serve in the\n\u2014 in the Russian army because, due to the fact that I have finished gymnasium, and I\nspeak the \u2014 I speak Lithuanian, German, and \u2014 an-and Russian, so I would be a\ngood prospect. He se \u2014 he told me that there is coming a \u2014 a group of \u2014 a\u2014 a group\nof people to \u2014 of military men to take some \u2014 to take \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 they are looking for\nsome inper \u2014 interpreter. They need very badly people who speak Lithuanian and\nRussian. Basically German is not, at this point, is not important, but it\u2019s going to\nbecome important later. And at the same time, they promulgated a law that all these\npeople from this and this year, they are going to be \u2014 they are going to be from\n1924, 1925, 1926, they are going to be taken to the army \u2014 to the regular army. And\nI say to myself, I would rather serve in a specialty unit than \u2014 than to wait and then\nbe recruited to the army. They have like a place where they called wayan(ph)\nkomat(ph). This is a\u2014 a\u2014a military place, whereby they check out new \u2014 theySeptember 22, 1994\ncheck out prospective soldiers, you know, health-wise and whether they have TB\nbecause there were many with \u2014 with TB, you know, from those that survived. So I\nactually signed up for this \u2014 for this unit. I remember a younger captain came in\nand \u2014 and interviewed me and he was satisfied. And then what he told me that he is\ngoing to recruit me and I will have to go through a short preparation \u2014 military\npreparation of about six weeks. And I agreed. In meantime, he told me I can \u2014 I can\nstay there and he gave me a official paper where I can go and find myself a\u2014a-\u2014a\napartment. So I found my relatives, those I mentioned, and I found myself not too\nfar away where I used to live before, on the same [indecipherable] on same main\nstreet. I got myself a nice apartment and my relatives were very happy. They had\ntwo children and \u2014 and myself and I told them, look, I am going to be just here, and\nonly temporary, and I am \u2014 I am going to be leaving. And also, was very interesting\nwalking on the \u2014 when I got myself a bicycle an-and riding on the bike, I met a very\ngood friend of mine, this Harmutz(ph), who was the \u2014 the head of the ORT. He\nwasn\u2019t in the ghetto and he was involved in the partisans. And he esca \u2014 I mean, he\njoined in also in the army but in the civilian department. They made him a \u2014 like a\ncommissar, or something, in the civilian department because he \u2014 he had excellent\ncontacts in the \u2014 with some high-ranking people. So I met with him and it was\nincredible, incredible meeting, you know, to \u2014 in \u2014 in middle of \u2014 of \u2014 of nowhereSeptember 22, 1994\nor something like, you know, in the middle of the city, to meet somebody that was\nsuch a close friend of mine. Then, from there, I \u2014 I was \u2014 I was sent toa\u2014toa\u2014toa\ntraining camp, and in about six weeks they send me to the first mission. I mean, I\nwas recruited, got the uniform, got my \u2014 they sent me within Lithuania, in certain\nplaces to \u2014 to be attached to the \u2014 there was also \u2014 you see, there was also a\nLithuanian brigade under the Commander Vilinski(ph), who was \u2014 which was\nformed right when the war \u2014 in the beginning of the war. Very brave. Many of those\npeople died in \u2014 in deep Russia, you know, and it was incredible, really. But I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 I joined the regular ar-army, which I \u2014 I said that is a policing force, which\nis called the \u2014 it was the 33rd regiment of the [indecipherable] NK VD, which was\nthe border police, attached to the NK VD. After the training and after they send me\nto Lithuania, they send me to a place, to Liepaja, which was Courland, in \u2014 that\nwas in Latvia. And there \u2014 there we had big \u2014 a big fight because there were \u2014 there\nwere the \u2014 I don't know whether you heard about the Vlasovtsy. That is a General\nVlasov, a Ukrainian who joined the Germans and he created a Ukrainian \u2014\nUkrainian battalion. Alway \u2014 almost the army, who fought with the Germans\nagainst the Russians, against their own people. So there were entrenched the \u2014 a\ngroup of \u2014 of those people, and they fought tooth and nail because they knew that if\nthey are going to be captured, they are going to be killed [indecipherable]. They\n111\nSeptember 22, 1994\nwouldn't take them as prisoners. And there I had my \u2014 my first accident. I was in a\nJeep with a \u2014 with a captain, and \u2014 and a driver, and there was a big shelling, and it\nhit the Jeep, and I was just knocked out fro-from the Jeep, and I found myself later\nin the hospital. Thanks God I had only two broken ribs and \u2014 and small \u2014 small\ncontusions and some \u2014 some other things, you know. But the captain who was\nsitting next to me was killed, a Russian captain. And then from there, I \u2014 they sent\nme after I \u2014 took me about 14, 15 days to \u2014 to be back on my feet \u2014 they \u2014 they send\nme to Germany, was to ca \u2014 and participate in \u2014 in liberating the City of\nKonigsburg, which was very interesting. And from there, they came a order to \u2014\nafter a while, came an order \u2014 a special order, that our regiment was going to be\nsent entirely to the [indecipherable] Islands, to the Japanese front. And I was the\nonly one that got the assignment to join Chuikov\u2019s army in the direction of Berlin.\nAnd this was \u2014 and I feel that this was because the \u2014 the colonel that was in charge,\nVenakurov(ph), I think it was, Jewish. And I \u2014 I told him once, I said, look \u2014 I\npleaded with him, I told him, look, I\u20141if you are going to send me to the\n[indecipherable] Islands, I am going to be of no use, and I am in the mood, you\nknow, to \u2014 to take vengeance for \u2014 for my people, and I \u2014 I think my place wil \u2014\nshould be on the German front rather than on the \u2014 on the Japanese front. So next\nday, I \u2014 I found a \u2014 a \u2014 it\u2019s called kommandi(ph) rofka(ph). That means my\n112September 22, 1994\nassignment to travel. And this is when I traveled through Warsaw. I remember\ntraveling through Warsaw bridge, it took us maybe an hour to pass this bridge,\nbecause the bridge was completely damaged and the train was going slowly through\nthat. And then there I joined the \u2014 I joined Chuikow\u2019s forces. And this was\nincredible experience, incredible experience. Then we marched, I mean we went \u2014\nwhen we \u2014 we continued to Berlin and we also liberated a concentration camp of\nSachsenhausen. And we had in our \u2014 in our power, most of the \u2014 of the guards\nfrom the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen. Now the \u2014",
        "A: What we saw was \u2014 was \u2014 was terrible, terrible things. I mean the \u2014 the face of\nthe \u2014 there were few people \u2014 I mean, not too many people. I would say a few\nhundred people. Maybe it were \u2014 maybe more than that, maybe around thousand\npeople that were \u2014 were liberated. Most of them we found many, many, ravines\nwith \u2014 with human bodies, you know, skeletons. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was a\nterrible, a terrible, terrible view, you know, to see that, see what actually \u2014 there\nwere \u2014 and this \u2014 in Sachsenhausen, there were not only Jews, there were also\nmany, many from other different nationalities. There were Russian prisoners, there\nwere \u2014 there were Polaks, and there were some not \u2014 non-Jewish people also. We\nhave \u2014 we were successful because they \u2014 they actually \u2014 they wanted to \u2014 the \u2014 theSeptember 22, 1994\nguards actually threw away their weapons, and they wanted to \u2014 they \u2014 they actually\nsurrendered. The \u2014 the fight was \u2014 it was not a big fight because they \u2014 they felt that\n\u2014 that it\u2019s over and although there were SS, they were pure SS. They were not the\nWehrmacht. And they were all apprehended, most of them. The \u2014 the head of the\ncamp, I mean, the \u2014 the commander of the camp and \u2014 and the \u2014 the more important\npeople were \u2014 they \u2014 they escaped. We would spend there a short time. There was\nalso a very big stench, you know, because there was \u2014 this camp was \u2014 was dev-\ndevastated, you know. They have committed so many atrocities, apparently they\nwanted to move the people, to move out \u2014 to move out a little bit further, because,\nyou know, Sachsenhausen is not far from Berlin. It's like 50 kilometers from\nBerlin. They \u2014",
        "A: So they \u2014 they have decided, and it was a\u2014 a captain that was \u2014 dec-decided that\nthey, rather than \u2014 they rather surrender than \u2014 than \u2014 than keep up fighting. The \u2014\nthe people were \u2014 I mean, they were like, stunned when we came in. They \u2014 they \u2014\nthey didn't know. They \u2014 they thought we were angels. We were \u2014 we were \u2014 we\ncame down from heaven, you know. They \u2014 they \u2014 they have never, never believed\nthat they are going to be able to survive, you know, because they \u2014 because they\nwere \u2014 that was a German camp. It was not \u2014 there are many Germans, also,\n114\nSeptember 22, 1994\nGerman Jews. It was a swift liberation on this \u2014 this camp was remarkable. And\nthen, through the guards, we found out many, many, many details in their \u2014 I mean,\nin \u2014 in questioning them. We brought them to \u2014 those people, we brought them to\nour \u2014 to our headquarters.",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Seven\n115September 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: \u2014 everything what they have left behind them. So they \u2014 I remember that, yeah.\nThat is the \u2014",
        "A: About the escape from \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was not part of the army. I was with the army, but I was still not \u2014 I was still\nnot a\u2014a soldier. I was still \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: But I\u2014I-",
        "A: Yeah, so Sachsenhausen, we had \u2014 we were successful in \u2014\n116September 22, 1994",
        "A: Yeah, we were successful and \u2014 in getting most of the guards with us. Of course,\nI wouldn\u2019t say all of them, but most. And we held them in [indecipherable] which\nwas east \u2014 in east Berlin, in ern(ph) Schnellstrasse, for the purposes of a\ninvestigation. At that time, the colonel that was the head of my superior officer, he\nwanted to make a small process, similar to the Nuremberg process. And that was\none of the reasons why we went twice to Nuremberg, before consultations. But\nthen I \u2014 truthfully, I don\u2019t know what happened afterwards, you know, because he\nwas called to \u2014 he was called to Moscow, to meet with Molotov, for a certain \u2014 for\n\u2014 for certain reasons, and fortunately for me, I \u2014 I was not able to see him when he\ncame back, because I was not in the Russian army any more when \u2014 when he came\nback. Now, during the investigations, we have \u2014 we have had \u2014 very spontaneously\nthey \u2014 the guards have cooperated. They gave us many details, and they gave us as\nmuch information as they \u2014 as they were able to. And there was a case within this\ninvestigation, where we had a lieutenant that broke down, because the investigation,\nwe used to \u2014 the \u2014 we used to conduct them between one and four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. And this was \u2014 precisely this was done in this fashion, because that was\nthe \u2014 the way the \u2014 the KGB, and the NKVD used to \u2014 used to conduct themselves,\nbecause they feel that in this they\u2019re under \u2014 under \u2014 under \u2014 in \u2014 in a silent\n117September 22, 1994\nambience, and with \u2014 with \u2014 with some heavy lights focused on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on\nthe prisoner, and the heavy questioning, they \u2014 they had no choice but they had to \u2014\nto spill out all the information that they had. So we had this case with the lieutenant\nwho \u2014 who broke down, and he jumped through \u2014 broke the window, jumped down\nand \u2014 and fell on top of a picket fence. And we thought that he \u2014 he wanted to\ncommit suicide, you know, but fortunately for him, he \u2014 he survived, and he was\nable then later to complete \u2014 complete the investigation and give us the additional\ninformation that we were looking for. I mean, especially so longer it was, we were\npreparing for a process, we needed more exact information about th-the conditions,\nand about the brutalities they have committed, and their approach to the \u2014 to the\nprisoners with their \u2014 their food rationing, their \u2014 their \u2014 the \u2014 the composition of\nthe \u2014 of the people in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the camp, and the \u2014 and so many\ndetails that were \u2014 everything were \u2014 we had \u2014 everything was written down, and \u2014\nand ready, almost, for a \u2014 for a process.",
        "A: Yes, we \u2014 we \u2014 we were part of the liber \u2014 became about SS \u2014 as you know, the\nBerlin was the last stronghold of Hitler and his \u2014 and his followers. He, of course,\nwent with her, and now he \u2014 I mean the \u2014 he\u2019s so ready that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s over, it\u2019s\n118September 22, 1994\nfinished. The 1,000 year Reich is coming to the end. And he gathered, of course, his\nmain advisors, and they \u2014 they have apparently decided to \u2014 to throw the last \u2014 the\nlast kampf. Not mein kampf, but the last kampf, the last battle, to see \u2014 they \u2014\nthey wanted \u2014 they were very much disappointed to fell into the ru \u2014 in the Russian\nhands. They felt much more comfortable if they would have fallen into the French,\nBritish, or American \u2014 they \u2014 their desire was to \u2014 to be in the American hands, but\nunfortunately for them, and fortunately \u2014 and unfortunately for some Russians also\n\u2014as you know, Eisenhower stopped to the Elbe, and he gave orders just to stop\nthere, not to go ahead. It was a tactical \u2014 I \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a\u2014 a good decision in\none way, and a bad decision in a si \u2014 1n the other way, because this what prompted\nfor what happened afterwards, because Berlin was taken by the Russians. The\nRussians were very happy, because to them, you see, the Americans, they are more\ngeared for \u2014 for individuals. The Russians are more geared for masses. The ind-\nindividuals don\u2019t count, you know, and they didn\u2019t count in the Soviet Union. So\nthey fell to \u2014 to sacrifice 50,000 more of troops couldn\u2019t make a difference, you\nknow. Eisenhower thought in different terms. He thought, let the Russians take it.\nWhy should we sacrifice our people? And \u2014 and this was \u2014 it was a smart decision,\nas I mentioned, in the sense that not \u2014 not to sacrifice more \u2014 more G.Ls.",
        "A: But \u2014 yeah, so we went in, and th-there \u2014 Berlin was taken, as you know, by the\nshtrafniki. There were a few battalions of th \u2014 of \u2014 of prisoners, and deserters, and\nthey were given a opportunity to get in the fight of Berlin, and get amnesty for the\nlife \u2014 I mean, if they \u2014 if they survive. And this was a tremendous battle, you know,\nbecause Hitler threw all the \u2014 all his reserves, and all those who were faithful to\nhim, especially a \u2014 a big force of Hitlerjugend. That was the \u2014 the young Hitler\narmy. The battle was over pretty soon. The \u2014 the resistance was not as strong as the\nRussians had thought it\u2019s going to be, and the city fell. The Russians have\nconcentrated the east \u2014 east side of Berlin, and we have \u2014 we \u2014 we were assigned \u2014\nwe were coming in, we were assigned to go to the Reichs Chancellery, which was\nthe \u2014 which was the hideout of Hitler, and his followers, his closest followers. We\nhave found the Reichs Chancellery with a\u2014 with a bomb, which penetrated\nthrough the roof, and have never exploded. And the inside, it was almost everything\nin \u2014 in pretty \u2014 pretty good condition, except for the \u2014 for the big hole that opened\nup from a \u2014 now, we found also the \u2014 the bunker of Hitler, which was incredible,\nincredible art work, in the sense of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of security, providing security for \u2014\nfor a tyrant like \u2014 like Hitler and his \u2014 his people. We found doors, steel doors,\nwhich like three foot of thickness of the door. We found the \u2014 the \u2014 from beton \u2014\nfrom \u2014 from concrete, about 10 foot of concrete thickness, you know, walls, and \u2014\n120September 22, 1994\nand to the point where we found quite a lot of documents. And basically we had the\norders, and we found also traces of Eva Braun and Hitler, which we feel that this\nwas their \u2014 th-their \u2014 their ashes. That was never confirmed, because the Russians\nhave not \u2014 were not interested in, for some reason, to publicize that, and they have\ncleaned out the place, as soon after we found that. But most of the documents, in the\ndocumentary, we have turned over to the \u2014 to the Americans, who used to come\nwith Studebakers, and take them away, because for some \u2014 some \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they was [indecipherable] from their archives. What kind of documents, I\nreally don\u2019t know, because I \u2014 I myself have not had a \u2014 a chance to \u2014 had we\nknown that there were valuable documents, because they were \u2014 they were in the ru\n\u2014 the fact that they were in the Reichs Chancellery, and the fact that they were in\nwell \u2014 well-guarded, and well preserved, was that \u2014 that they are \u2014 they had \u2014 and\nI\u2019m sure that there were \u2014 they\u2019re somewhere stashed away, or they\u2019re now still in \u2014\nin \u2014 in separate places in \u2014 in United States. Because based what Officer\nSchwartz(ph) told me \u2014 not officer, he was a sergeant, whom I met and who was\nthe one that used to come with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with the trucks, and we used to help\nthe \u2014 our soldiers used to help to pack them. Now, right after that, we \u2014\n121September 22, 1994\nremains \u2014",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were in the \u2014 in the courtyard. Was a big courtyard\nsurrounding the Reichs Chancellery, and there was a big fence around that. And\nwe found that in \u2014 in \u2014 in one spot, it was like \u2014 it was not on the ground, it was on\n\u2014 on -\u2014 on top of the ground.",
        "A: We found out about that. I mean, it\u2019s a \u2014 we were \u2014 it\u2019s presumably that they \u2014\nthey were the ashes from \u2014 from Hitler.",
        "A: Because for some \u2014 pile of ashes, you know, and there were some \u2014 also some\ntraces of bones, and some other things. We knew they\u2019re human \u2014 they\u2019re human\nrem \u2014 remains, but we didn\u2019t \u2014 of course, we didn\u2019t know that \u2014 but then later we\nfound out that this \u2014 this was \u2014 and it came to \u2014 we came to the conclusion.\nAlthough, the Russians felt that they \u2014 I had a \u2014 nobody knows their reasonings.\nRather than come out publicly \u2014 publicly and say look, why don\u2019t we find it, they\nreally didn\u2019t \u2014 were not very much interested in the details. They felt that \u2014 for\nsome reason they have a \u2014 they had a different attitude. They would rather \u2014 rather\nthan start researching documents, they would rather send people to \u2014 to the gulag.\nSend Nazis to the gulag, imprison them. Have a short trial without any \u2014 any \u2014September 22, 1994\nwithout any benefits for those \u2014 for the prisoners, and \u2014 and just tr-transport them.\nThat was their aim, they were so fed up and \u2014 and so bitter, that they \u2014 they \u2014 the \u2014\nthe Germans, for them, were like \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 they \u2014 they just were not able to\nstand them at all, you know. And th-then there\u2019s \u2014 and there\u2019s \u2014 we understand the\nreason for that, you know. So, right there in [indecipherable] we \u2014 we were living\n[indecipherable] in the compound, in there, where our main offices were. Then\nfrom \u2014 next to us was a\u2014 a\u2014 was a Store from a \u2014 a place where some German Jews\nhad a\u2014 there were furs. They had \u2014 they \u2014 they made furs. And I\u2019ve befriended\nthem. The name was Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and his brother, and then his wife. He\nmarried a \u2014 a German woman, whose husband \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, in this \u2014 in this case, oh yes, in the beginning, yes, of course. That was \u2014 we\n\u2014 we did \u2014 we did that, we did shooting, you know.",
        "A: Of course, yeah. We did. But \u2014 [interruption] Especially in Lithuania, when\n123September 22, 1994\nwe were in Lithuania, we \u2014 the main \u2014 main work was persecution of \u2014 of\ncriminals, and \u2014 [interruption] In \u2014 in Berlin, I did more in \u2014 more \u2014 more work as\ninterpreter, because I was mostly assigned to this \u2014 to the coroner, whereby when I\nwas in Lithuania, I didn\u2019t have a \u2014 a special assignee \u2014 assignment, you know, I\nwas mostly as \u2014 we moved, especially when we took [indecipherable], I mean, I\nwas in the \u2014 in \u2014 it was part of the \u2014 of the training, but it was not the training, it\nwas already in the battlefield.",
        "A: So, I met Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and I befriended him, and I explained to him\nthat I have relatives in Cuba. We became very friendly, and I used to go to his\nhouse, and beside that, I \u2014 I was very close to \u2014 to the [indecipherable] Baruck(ph)\nwas his name. He was a Ukrainian, and he \u2014 he was a colonel. And I used to ha \u2014 I\nhad with him a very good relationship. He had all his family with him in Berlin.\nAnd like most of the Russians, he was interested in \u2014 in some material help, you\nknow. So we \u2014 what we used to \u2014 my assignment was to bring in \u2014 our assignment\nwas to bring in some people from the \u2014 from the \u2014 that used to belong to the Nazi\nparty, or that used to be involved some way in the \u2014 in \u2014 in some criminal activities\nor something. And \u2014 and we used to get him as \u2014 as informers. So we have them on\nour list, we had a \u2014 one of the informers was a \u2014 had a gramophone factory. They\u2019re\n124September 22, 1994\nthe one who had the slaughterhouse. One has a \u2014 like a other type of factory, I don\u2019t\nremember what was. So what \u2014 I used to have a motorcycle, with a side one. So\nthose people were redeemed in a certain way. There was al-always the sword of\nDamocles was hanging over their \u2014 over their neck, you know. But they were, in a\ncertain way, so long they were able to form, and to give all the information about\nsome more bigger fish, you know. So once a week we used to \u2014 they used to come\nto our compou \u2014 to our compound \u2014 I mean \u2014 and they used to meet with the \u2014 with\nthe \u2014 used to come very discreetly. We had a special entrance for them. And they\nused to give all \u2014 all kind of information, you know. So, when I used to \u2014 I used to\ngo to meet them from time to time, to visit them, they used to fill up my side, you\nknow, from the motorcycle, like with all kind of meats, and everything, and they\nused to take that \u2014 there used to be Alexanderplatz(ph), which was a \u2014 a \u2014 a place,\na very special place for black market, and \u2014 and for all kind of illegal activities, you\nknow. Used to take that over there, and they used to sell it, and then bring the\nmoney to \u2014 to \u2014 to the commander, and you know, to the \u2014 and turned it over to\nhim. He used to give me something like a [indecipherable] and I was very, very\nhappy, you know. And then, when I used to go with the gramophone factory, used\nto be loaded with gramophones, you know. They \u2014 the Germans, I mean they \u2014 they\nhad a\u2014a very interesting thing, it\u2019s when they \u2014 when \u2014 when they capitulated, I\n125September 22, 1994\nmean, that was it. They wouldn\u2019t get involved in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in terrorist or some\nother activities, that was it. In the meantime, I used to go with \u2014 with Colonel\nBaruck(ph). He \u2014 he was very friendly with the chief of police from \u2014 from Berlin,\nand they used to go hunting together, and I was with them, always. So one day, I \u2014 I\nbecame friendly also with the chief of police, and I told him I \u2014I say, I\u2019m involved\nin \u2014 in this type of activities where sometimes I have to go from one sector \u2014 now\nthat Berlin is divided four sector; the French, the British, the Russian, and the \u2014 and\nthe American. I says, and I am sometimes in jeopardy, so I need a \u2014 a ausweis \u2014 I \u2014\na card, as a German. He hesitated, but then he gave it to me, you know. And I say,\ndon\u2019t mention it to anybody, because this is due to my work, you know. So, when I\nmet with Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), and I disclosed him that I eventually want to \u2014 I\nhave relatives in Cuba, and I\u2019d like to get out, because pretty soon they\u2019re going to\ndemobilize me and send me back to Lithuania, which was \u2014 I didn\u2019t have any\ndesire to go back to Lithuania. So we start actively pursuing, I mean, how to \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what \u2014 what to do, how to \u2014 so one day he comes for \u2014 to me, very happy,\nand he says, listen, I mean, there is a Joint \u2014 the Joint Distribution Center in \u2014 in\nWest Berlin, in the American sector. Why don\u2019t we go over there? And I used to\nwear sometimes, civilian clothes also, because due to my work, I mean, I used to\nhave to be camouflaged, you know, so I wore more civilian than \u2014 than military. So\n126September 22, 1994\nI say, okay, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s move. So, we took the U-Bahn, you know, the metro? And\nwe went to \u2014 I think it was in \u2014 in Charlottenburg. So, we came into the Joint\nDistribution, and there is a American colonel, and I say, look, I\u2019m a\u2014 a Russian and\nJewish officer in the Russian army, and I would like to \u2014 you should help me to\nflee, and I \u2014 I have my relatives in Cuba, and I \u2014 I just would like to get away,\nbecause \u2014 I explained to him, I say, I\u2019m going to be very openly where you \u2014 open\nwith you, I am truthfully \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 they \u2014 I have no use any more to be\nhere. I mean, I have already accomplished what I felt to accomplish. Now I will \u2014\nwhat I want is to \u2014 to \u2014 to get to my family, I mean, because I am by myself.\nThey\u2019re going to send me back to \u2014 he said, look, we\u2019re sorry, but we cannot do\nanything, because we have a very good relationship with the Russian, they\u2019re our\nallies, and we cannot create a \u2014 a\u2014 a-\u2014a international conflict. I say, international\n[indecipherable]. So I almost [indecipherable] because I saw here that my \u2014 my\nopportunity to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to get out, and I thought, they\u2019re going to \u2014 like, I\u2019m going\nto declare myself like a \u2014 a\u2014a refugee, and then that\u2019s it. So he says \u2014 he calls on\nhis secretary. He said, look, you know where your relatives are in Cuba, what\u2019s\ntheir name? And I say, yes, I have their name. Do you \u2014 do you know where they\nare? I say, no, they\u2019re in Havana. Do you have a address? I give to her address. So I\nsay, why don\u2019t you send \u2014 we are going to send a telegram. We\u2019re going to sendSeptember 22, 1994\nthat to the Jewish community center in Havana, to make the story short. And I\nthought, I mean, this 1s a\u2014 I mean, he just wanted to get rid of me, and then he \u2014 he\n\u2014 he just [indecipherable]. Exactly 20 days later, Helmut(ph) calls me and says,\nhey. He says, I have a letter from Cuba for you. A month later, and I almost fainted,\nyou know. I had my, in Yiddish [indecipherable] letter from my uncle, telling me\nthat my other uncle, you know, that I left, and he was in the concentration camp in\nBuchenwald was liberated. His wife was liberated, and they tried to locate the\ndaughter. And that my friend, this Prather(ph), that he was together with me in \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 in the camps, and I helped him, is in Munich, and he\u2019s studying engineering,\nand they\u2019re going to get in touch with him to \u2014 he should help me escape. And\npretty soon I received another letter, from Munich, from \u2014 and this letters wer \u2014\nwent to Helmut(ph) Selten(ph), not to me, of course, because I had to be very \u2014\nvery much \u2014 very much careful, because any \u2014 any step on the side, I would have\nbeen completely \u2014 I mean, they would send me to Siberia. Not even that, they\nwould shoot me. There would be a court martial. So \u2014 can we interrupt for a\nminute?",
        "A: So I received \u2014 I received a letter from Louie\u2019s brother, who was in Munich,\nschool of \u2014 engineering school, and beautiful letter from him, that he\u2019s going to trySeptember 22, 1994\nto do everything possible, that he received, he received a \u2014 a \u2014 a letter from Cuba,\nfrom my uncles. And incidentally, my \u2014 my letter [indecipherable] mine \u2014 my\nletter went to Cuba. I mean, not my letter, their \u2014 their \u2014 their \u2014 their telegram that\nthey sent from the \u2014 from the Joint Distribution Center, they send it to the \u2014 to the\nJewish Community Center. My uncle was the president at that time, from the\ncommunity center. He was the one that brought most of the family, brought the\nother uncle, and everything. So Prather(ph) told me in his letter \u2014 I mean, he\nmentioned that he 1s going to \u2014 that he has a \u2014 a hunch that \u2014 that he has already\nsomebody that \u2014 that will be able \u2014 be in \u2014 that\u2019s going to be helpful in my \u2014 in my\ndefection from the Russian army. That time, I remember it was already \u2014 it was\nPassover. And Helmut(ph), I mean the contact was Helmut(ph) all the time.\nHelmut(ph) calls me again and says there is \u2014 there is some people that came from\n[indecipherable] a husband and wife and a child. Three people. And they want to\nmeet with me. So I made sure that nobody\u2019s following me, and I met with them.\nAnd this was a guy that was a\u2014 a smuggler. He used to smuggle from the \u2014 from\nthe American \u2014 from the Russian zone, certain items to the American zone, and\nfrom the American zone to the Russian zone. So he approached me, told me that he\nis \u2014 that Prather(ph) sent him, and that he understand that I want to be helped to\ncross the border in a certain place, which he \u2014 he knows very well, he says. And he\n129September 22, 1994\ntravels always with his wife and child, because that makes \u2014 doesn\u2019t gi \u2014 doesn\u2019t\nmake him too \u2014 those \u2014 the people, and the guards to be suspicious. He didn\u2019t know\nthat I am \u2014 I am in \u2014 in the Russian army, and Prather(ph) cautioned me against\nthat, he said, don\u2019t tell him that you are in the army, because then he is not going to\ndo that, and then he is not going to help you. So I told him, look, I\u2019m also in the\nsmuggling business, and I do this and this and that, and I have \u2014 have certain\ncontacts which I want to see in the \u2014 in American zone, and this and that. So we\narranged this. I went to the \u2014 I left him behind, I went to the bahnhof, to the train\nstation, and there were a huge amount of people. I went in uniform, and I bought\nfour tickets, to go like to \u2014 1n the direction of Bremen, with the train. Then I \u2014 I\ntook my motorcycle, and I took it to a safe place, and I called a guy, and say okay,\nwe have the tickets. When do we go? He say, we have to go immediately. Says,\nthere is no time to \u2014 to waste. I get myself \u2014",
        "A: I have a \u2014 first of all, I calmed down for a minute, and I was very excited,\nbecause that was a\u2014 a-\u2014a incredible step to take, you know, because to \u2014 to go out\n\u2014 it\u2019s not to leave Berlin, because you see, Berlin ha \u2014 was in four sectors. But\nBerlin by itself, found itself within the Russian occupational zone, which meansSeptember 22, 1994\nthat in order to get out from Berlin is not to get out of Berlin, I had to get out from\nthe whole zone, to cross through hundred \u2014 few hundred kilometers. And this is not\n\u2014 it\u2019s not easy, because although at that time, in 1947 \u2014 that was already 1947, in\nthat time there was still not \u2014 there was still not as tight as it became tighter later. So\nI \u2014I figured out, what shall I do? So I had a little, small caliber pistol, which I took\naway from my German officer, still in \u2014 in K6nigsburg \u2014 with \u2014 the handles were\nmade from elephant bone. Beautiful, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it was something remarkable.\nAnd I had a bunch of \u2014 first of all, in the \u2014 in the army, the Russian army I was paid\nas a officer, I received a certain amount of money in Russian rubles, and then a\ndouble amount in German occupational marks. I had money, I had more than what I\ncan \u2014 was able to use. And incidentally, I used to send \u2014 every month I was able to\nsend two packages, and I used to send to my relatives in \u2014 in \u2014 in Kovno, his\nfamily. Every \u2014 every month I send them two big packages, with all kind of\ngoodies. So then I had my \u2014\nEnd of Tape EightSeptember 22, 1994\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Right. Let me finish \u2014 let me finish this part, which is \u2014 I will tell you something.\nOne day, I will talk to Spielberg, you know, one day we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll make a very\nprofitable film for him. So \u2014 so I had my German ausweis, which I got from the\nchief of police when we were out hunting. I had my \u2014 my Russian ausweis. I had\nmoney, rubles, money in German occupational marks, and I have a little caliber\npistol. And the little caliber was \u2014 was \u2014 and you will not believe for what. Not to\nshoot anybody, but to shoot myself if \u2014 if \u2014 if they would \u2014 if they would catch me\nbecause there\u2019s no question in my mind, th-they would \u2014 they would have done this\nwithout any reproach, you know. So \u2014 and then we moved to the \u2014 moved to the\ntrain, and I figured already everything out. I figured we have a long voyage to a\nsmall town which is going the direction to Bremen, but Bremen is in the eng \u2014 in\nthe British Zone of occupation. But I felt that \u2014 I figured out, I said, I know that this\ntrain is going to be searched. There is going to be a \u2014 some type of guard is going to\ncome in at some certain point to check the documenta \u2014 documents on the train.\nBecause that was a normal procedure and I \u2014 I knew it\u2019s going to happen. I also \u2014 I\nthought to myself, it\u2019s going to come in a German guard, I\u2019m going to show them\nthat I am a Russian and I traveled there to see some relatives. And I didn\u2019t have aSeptember 22, 1994\nproblem because I \u2014 I had also this Baruck(ph), my colonel, was out of town. He\nwas in \u2014 in Moscow for a conference, and I had the right to \u2014 to \u2014 to travel to a\ncertain \u2014 certain distance, because I need \u2014 I needed a special permit, which I didn\u2019t\nhave. But I could \u2014 I could justify my trip, you know, because I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t\ncarry with me any \u2014 any \u2014 any belongings or anything, it\u2019s just only a small thing.\nThen I said, if it comes a Russian, I\u2019m going to identify myself as a German. What\ncan I do? Okay. We \u2014 we travel. The train was crowded. I mean, so crowded it was\nthat \u2014 were unable to turn. Suddenly, we come to a certain point, there\u2019s soldiers.\nRussian and Germans together. I say, that\u2019s my day. That\u2019s my day, what shall I do?\nAnd I had to think quickly. I was next to the guy with the \u2014 with his wife, and we\nwere chatting and \u2014 and here comes the guard, documents, documents, documents. I\nventured to pull out my German rather than Russian, and I think I made the right\ndecision, you know. In the middle of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of looking at my \u2014 checking my\ndocument, the child starts crying. And some way that tension was deflected, and I\nwas da \u2014 I \u2014 I think it was a sheer \u2014 sheer luck for me, you know. And they just only\nask me where I travel, and I said \u2014 I knew right town and [indecipherable]. So why\ndo you come [indecipherable]. And I said a few words in German, you know, and\n\u2014 and my worries were over. They came to the \u2014 almost to the border. We come off.\nThen he said to me, no, we have to go now. We have to walk now for about two\n133September 22, 1994\nkilometers, because there is a place where I will always go through, but there is a\nvery little where \u2014 sometimes even \u2014 they don't have even a guard on the border.\nBecause you see, it\u2019s not a natural border, now where they \u2014 which they had \u2014 when\nthey made later, in the later years, like when they \u2014 when they had the air supply,\nBerlin, and th-that was much more difficult to escape now. But in 1947, was still \u2014\nyou know, it was still at a point where the war was still \u2014 I mean, they were still not\n\u2014 not so organized now. And I remember when we crossed \u2014 I mean, there \u2014 we\nheard some shots on the other side [indecipherable] but it was not relevant. We\ncrossed and there were \u2014 not the last, there were quite a few people who \u2014 who\ncrossed. Apparently, this was the place where we crossed the border. And there was\na big sign that said, you are entering the British Zone of occupation. If you have\nsome armaments, or some illegal \u2014 illegal items, the kommandantur is here, here,\nand here. You have to immediate identify yourself and deliver that to the\nkommandantur. | kissed the ground when I found myself in this. And then I \u2014 I\npulled out, the first thing, I-I threw my pistol and I said, the hell with that, I was\ngoing to throw \u2014 this guy grabs me by the hand, he says, what is that? I didn\u2019t know\nyou were armed, he said to me. I said, why not? And he said, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s completely\nprohibited. You cannot have arms. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s against \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s\nagainst the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the terms, you know. So who are you? What ha \u2014 you\n134September 22, 1994\nare not a smuggler like you told me. I said, no, no, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but I\u2019m a\nRussian officer. He says, you\u2019re crazy. How come you didn't tell me? I say, because\nI didn't feel it was irrel \u2014 relevant to tell you. He said, give me, give me. Let me see\nthe pistol. I said \u2014 he say [indecipherable], took it, he says, you know what, I\u2019m\ngoing to bury that right here. When I come back, I\u2019Il take it. It\u2019s worth \u2014 it\u2019s worth\n500 dollars, he say, that\u2019s \u2014 this is so beautiful. This \u2014 this is real \u2014 real elephant\nbone handle. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s worth a fortune. I said, you can have it. You need\nsome marks? I told him, you have here marks also, because they are useless here.\nBecause I had \u2014 I had the Russian occupation \u2014 I mean, the German occupational\nmarks, which belong to the \u2014 on the Russian border \u2014 on the \u2014 the \u2014 the Russian\nzone, not the \u2014 the \u2014 the British and the American zone had different \u2014 different\nmarks, you know. So I gave it to him and then we went to \u2014 from there we went to\nBremen. In Bremen, we slept in the \u2014 1n the railroad station. I red \u2014 I had my\nknapsack and my \u2014 my boots were my \u2014 my pillow. I was so happy. From there I\nhad to go to Bergen-Belsen, which was in the vicinity, because there I had my\ncontact. So I went to Bergen-Belsen, spend there a night. And then I found the man\nthat\u2019s supposed to take me back to \u2014 take me to Munich. And then I came to\nMunich, my friend was ecstatic. He had a little, tiny-miney room, you know, big as\nmy closet here. And he says, we can share it, I mean, you can stay here. And for the\n135September 22, 1994\nfirst time, I had a good meal, you know. Fantastic, you know, say \u2014 with some\nAmerican products, and some other thing. I forgot to mention to you that when we\nwere in the \u2014 in Berlin, I had to mention to you something very important, that I \u2014 I\noverlooked something. Being in Berlin, we had a \u2014 I had a special mission. I don't\nknow how many people are aware, but I-I don't think too many are aware of that.\nI\u2019m going to tell you that they \u2014 they have transplanted factories from Berlin to\nsome \u2014 they \u2014 they used to take them to different parts of Russia. So I was assigned\na mission with a truck with three soldiers to go to \u2014 they have \u2014 taking out the IG\nFarben company from Berlin, and they are supposed to be shipped to Leningrad\nto dismantle completely. Not only dismantle, what they have \u2014 our assignment was\nto take the workers, including even the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the lowest paid guy, like, the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the guy that cleans the factory. Everybody had to be placed on a train by five\no\u2019clock in the morning. And we used to come with a truck and come to the house\nand knock on the door and say, out in five minutes. Sei haben five minuten. So\nyou have five minutes to \u2014 to get your belongings and \u2014 and out on the car. This\nwas such a pleasure, this task that I had. Of course, it was nothing compared to what\nthey have done to me. But it was, I \u2014 I cer \u2014I found a certain \u2014 although, I didn\u2019t\nhave anything against the \u2014 against the guys, those guys that worked there in the\nfactory, no. Now, this \u2014 this factory, for a fact, they were so organized \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014September 22, 1994\nthe Russians were so organi \u2014 disorganized, that it took them X amount of months\nto reach the destiny for the factory. And then they found out that part of the factory\nwent to one place, to Smolensk and the other one went to Leningrad. And tha-that\nwas the what \u2014 what the \u2014 but if that \u2014 what th \u2014 I had to mention that, because that\nwas a very, very unique experience, you know, whereby I \u2014 I was in charge of \u2014 of\ntaking \u2014 I mean, to \u2014 disassembling and taking those people to the train station at\nfive o\u2019clock, and \u2014 and it \u2014 1t was a\u2014 a remarkable \u2014 you know, sometimes you\nremember certain \u2014 certain \u2014 so okay, so wh-when I came \u2014 when I came to\nMunich, I \u2014 it happened to be those people that I used to send packages. Those\nrelatives were in Feldafing.",
        "A: Next to Munich was small DP camps. One was Landsberg, and the other was \u2014\nwas Feldafing. They were in Feldafing. So I stayed couple days in Prather\u2019s\nhome, and then he took me to Feldafing, because they are \u2014 they\u2019re relatives. And\nthis lady, Fruma(ph) Lankavich(ph), she went out her way to accommodate me\nand to \u2014 and to \u2014 and to help me out. And what \u2014 what I wanted basically is to \u2014 to\nget \u2014 get out from Germany and go to \u2014 to Cuba. So there was \u2014 I asked her \u2014 from\nthere, I wrote already freely, you know, to \u2014 to Cuba, and they \u2014 they send me\nsome \u2014 they send me letters, and they send me also a letter saying that they have \u2014\nSeptember 22, 1994\nthey instituted a visa in \u2014 in \u2014 in fr \u2014 in Paris, to go to \u2014 I mean to \u2014 in order to\ncome to Cuba. Now, how do you go to Paris? I don\u2019t have any \u2014 any \u2014 any\ndocuments. So I start working on documents. In the meantime, a guy came by and\nhe said that he is \u2014 he\u2019s capable to \u2014 you know, we\u2019re very desperate, you know.\nThe time was now important to \u2014 to get out. I mean, we just wanted to reach already\na destiny, after so many pain and suffering. So we had \u2014 the guy said that for a\nhundred dollars, he is going to make me false papers to travel to France. So I \u2014 I\nfound a\u2014 a-\u2014a friend of \u2014 of the family, with the name of Bernard Picard(ph),\nwho also in Kovno ghetto. And he was a brigadier, the other brigade, Bernard\nPicard(ph). And he le \u2014 he lend me the \u2014 the hundred dollars. And I gave it to the\nguy and he made me this paper, it didn\u2019t look to me good, but I figured he \u2014 he \u2014 he\nknows what he\u2019s doing. But through the train, we went to Strasbourg, and through\nSaargebiet, you know. And when we came to France, the Saret\u00e9 came out, the\nFrench police took us off an-and \u2014 and sent \u2014 was going to send us back. And I\u2014 I\ngot very, very scared so I took out certain things that I had from the Russians and I\njust flushed it down the toilet, you know. Because I figured maybe they are going to\nsend me back to the [indecipherable] \u2014 you know, that time you were fearful, you\ndidn\u2019t know. They might send you back to \u2014 to your destiny, where you \u2014 you were\ncoming from. So then I came back to \u2014 to Feldafing, and we start working legally.\n138September 22, 1994\nAnd she helped me so much, this Fruma(ph). Fortunately, they went later to\nCanada, and she\u2019s passed away now. So then \u2014 then I was able to \u2014 I got \u2014 I got\nalready the \u2014 the real papers went to France, and then there I had my visa. I spent in\nFrance a few days, and then I found out, in order to go to United States \u2014 to Cuba,\nI have to go through United States and I need a visa. This is eight months. You had\nto wait for eight months for \u2014 to get \u2014 to get a visa to United States. So I started \u2014 I\nhad all \u2014 I found also a other guy that was going to Cuba, by the name \u2014 same name\nlike me, Abraham, but his name was Rabinowitz(ph). And he told me, wherever\nyou go, I go with you. I said, fine. So I start walking up and down in \u2014 in France, in\nParis, and \u2014 and looking. I spoke a little English, you know, it was easier for me\nbecause he didn\u2019t. And I start looking. Finally, I found \u2014 we found a maiden flight\nof a six-motor hydroplane from Air France, that was going to Dakar, Africa, and\nPort-Etienne. And from there \u2014 and to \u2014 from Dakar to Port-Etienne. So we \u2014\nwhat I did is, we had our tickets from Pan American. We exchanged that, and the\ncompany, they gave us credit and some way we hustled around and \u2014 and all \u2014 all\ntogeth \u2014 and all together, what we had was 10 dollars in our pocket. Then we took\nthe trip with this six-motor hid \u2014 hydroplane and it took us \u2014 it was an incredible\nflight, you know. They gave us champagne and we felt like kings already there.\nAnd then when we came to \u2014 to Port-Etienne, we had to go to Antigua \u2014 British\n139September 22, 1994\nAntigua. So from there, we went \u2014 we had to take a boat and go there, to British\nAntigua. And then from British Antigua, we found out that in order to go to Cuba,\nwe need still an American transit visa because we have to stay in Puerto Rico,\nwhich is an American \u2014",
        "A: I didn't have a passport.",
        "A: I ha\u2014I had a paper which says, stateless A \u2014 a \u2014 a person without a country.\nThat was there for everybody\u2019s standards. It was like \u2014 so finally, in \u2014 in Antigua,\nthere was a \u2014 it\u2019s a very small British island, but very clean. I remember comparing\nit to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to \u2014 to the French, which was just the opposite. The counsel was\nstaying at the same hotel that we stayed there. And the lady that \u2014 we told her our\nstories and made arrangements for us to \u2014 to see the counsel the next day. So next\nday when we went in, and so the first question of the counsel was, do you have\nsome money to sleep overnight in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Puerto Rico? I said, of course. I\nshow him the 10 dollars very proudly. When I came out, I gave it to my friend. He\ncame in with the same 10 dollars, and show that he has also 10 dollars, because that\nwas the minimum that you can have. And then August 1*'\u2014 and from there we\ncabled my uncle that we were coming down. So August 1\u201c, 1947, I landed inSeptember 22, 1994\nCamagiiey [indecipherable] in Havana, and my uncle came with his car to pick\nme up and pick up my \u2014 my friend. And this was the way we came to Cuba.",
        "A: It was a long trip but I found somebody waiting for me.",
        "A: Now, go ahead with the questions.",
        "A: That\u2019s not the question, that\u2019s the answer. [break]",
        "A: That are missing.",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 yeah, right.",
        "A: Yes. This \u2014 this is is precisely \u2014 I have a book of that which I have not had a\nchance to \u2014 to read. The \u2014 the Ninth Fort was one of the most vicious and criminal\nplaces in \u2014 in the \u2014 Lithuania, whereby, most of the \u2014 most of the inmates from \u2014\nfrom the camps were taken, and \u2014 taken. And it was \u2014 we had few forts, but the\nNinth Fort was the \u2014 was the one that\u2019s for \u2014 were the \u2014 that was best equipped to \u2014September 22, 1994\nto kill and also to dispose of the bodies. But you see, there were so many \u2014 so many\npeople were killed \u2014 or murdered, not killed \u2014 at the Ninth Fort, that they didn\u2019t\nhave \u2014 didn\u2019t give them time to get rid of the bodies. So what they did is, they used\nto burn \u2014 they used to place them in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in rows, you know, one on top of the\nother one. But then, apparently towards at the end of 1943, there came a order from\nthe Reichs command that it has to be something done in order to eliminate the\nbodies. So they were \u2014 they looked for a Sonderkommando, and they took a\nnumber of \u2014 of people and \u2014 of Jews from the \u2014 from \u2014 from the ghetto. And they\nhad decided they had some other people, which they kept there for a long time.\nWhat they used to do with those people is, after they \u2014 after they did their \u2014 their\ndirty work, they used to kill them and then bring in some new people, you know,\nbecause they \u2014 they always tried to \u2014 to hide their tracks behind \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthe evidence behind them. So they brought in this contingency of the\nSonderkommando, and they were there for some time, and they \u2014 they tried to \u2014\nthey exhumed the \u2014 the bodies and they tried to burn them. And the way they did \u2014\nthey used to do that, they used to lay them in \u2014 in layers and \u2014 and put in wood in\nbetween and then pour gas and then \u2014 and the, of course, in the concentration camps\nthey used crematoriums, which were more \u2014 more advanced technology. This, they\ndid it in more primitive way. And incidentally, I have some friends who are \u2014September 22, 1994\nespecially one friend that send me now a book, that escaped, one of the escapees. I\nmean, this was an incredible, incredible escape, which is like escaping from Sing\nSing, or for \u2014 whereby, they \u2014 they have plan. They knew that they are not going to\nlast too long because after they burn, I mean, they are going to be one of those who\nare going to be burned also. So what they plotted is, they found themselves that they\n\u2014 they have, New Year\u2019s Eve, they have some way got some additional \u2014 additional\nliquor for the guards and they \u2014 when they were drunk, they traced \u2014 they had a map\nof the ninth \u2014 of the Ninth Fort and they \u2014 some way they were able to escape and\nthis was a escape like a large group of \u2014 of \u2014 of people was able to escape, you\nknow. And this \u2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: They \u2014 many of them went to the \u2014 to the partisans. Especially my friend. He\njoined the \u2014 he joined the \u2014 the freedom fighters, and he \u2014 he survived. I mean, he \u2014\nhe survived being in the underground in the freedom fighters.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were a mixture. They were a mixture. They had \u2014 they had \u2014\n143September 22, 1994\nmost \u2014 most of the time, they had Lithuanian \u2014 had \u2014 had a \u2014 in some cases, where\nhead of the partisans was \u2014 were Lithuanian. In many cases, more of the cases, they\nwere \u2014 they were Russians. But there were some few Lithuanian partisans, head of\npartisans also, depending in what section were you, in what part of the \u2014",
        "A: No, not necessarily, no.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, I was, yes.",
        "A: They \u2014 they used to \u2014 they used to try to join up at one point. But it was always \u2014\nit was \u2014 practically, it was not to be in big groups, because big groups are spotted\nmuch easier than smaller groups. Even when they had bigger groups, they used to\nseparate themselves in \u2014 in \u2014 in smaller groups, and disperse themselves in\ndifferent \u2014 in different places.September 22, 1994",
        "A: They were a supply \u2014 they were not \u2014 they were in \u2014 in some places, they were\nin the Rudnitski(ph) Pushche, there were Jewish partisans. Some of them there are\nstill the Belski(ph) [indecipherable]. They were \u2014 they were strong, maybe five \u2014\n600. That was a big, big contingency. But there were pushche, you know, pushche\nmeans? It\u2019s a forest which is very dense and very, very difficult to penetrate. It\u2019s\nlike a jungle. But normally, Lithuania was not so dense, and especially where we\nwere, close to Janava. There was a forest, but it was not this type, not a great, great\nforest.",
        "A: About five weeks.",
        "A: Pardon? Pardon?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I was about close to five weeks in the \u2014 in Janava welder(ph).\nJanava, which is not too far away from Kovno.\n145September 22, 1994\nincredible feeling to go back into \u2014",
        "A: You mean when I came back to the ghetto? First \u2014 first \u2014 first trip was \u2014 my trip\nwas to the ghetto. I mean, I\u2014 I\u2014I was very anxious to find out what happened to\nthe house where I lived and to the \u2014 and to the basement where we had \u2014 where very\ningen \u2014 ingeniously, we \u2014 we used to make basements even during the time in the\nghetto, in many places. And that\u2019s the reason why they \u2014 somebody \u2014 somebody \u2014 I\nmean, betrayed us, you know. There were some-somebody betrayed many, many of\nthose, bu \u2014 and that\u2019s one of reasons why they came in. How did the Germans find\nout? Because this was done so carefully. The \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the sand or the \u2014 the soil\nwas taken so carefully, and it was done in the nighttime. And it was like \u2014 like \u2014\ntermites, you know, a slow, very slow process. And how did they know where it is?\nImagine, in \u2014 in \u2014 in my house, when I came in, we had \u2014 what we had is steps to\nthe second floor. So what we did is \u2014 it was like, professionally engineered. We\nwere able to take out a whole step and right through there, slide into the \u2014 to \u2014 to the\nbasement.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: To hide. To hide \u2014 in fact, hide things there where I \u2014 where was I \u2014 hidden my \u2014September 22, 1994\nmy cousin.",
        "A: A lot of people made hiding places, yeah. And \u2014 and for some reason, they \u2014\nthey found out. My place was open. When I came, it was open. And I found only\nsome photographs. I didn't find anything else, you know. But it was not \u2014 it was not\ndestroyed. It was not bombed. But in many other cases, were bombed. And some\npeople were buried under the \u2014 under the rubble of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the \u2014 they used\nto come in and throw grenades to make sure that \u2014 just the Germans would come\ninto a house and whether there is somebody or not, throw a grenade and everything\nwould \u2014 if one was not sufficient, throw a other grenade.",
        "A: No, no. When I came I \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t see anybody. I mean, I saw people\nwandering, but I found out that there were \u2014 there were \u2014 few families saved\nthemselves. And they were able to come out, to come \u2014 although they exploded\nmost of them, but few families \u2014 but that was really \u2014 I came in, it was already five,\nsix days after they liberated the \u2014 the city, you know, so people already came out.\nSome way they sensed that they are \u2014 that they are free, and they \u2014 and they came\nout. So I was not able, but I\u2014 I went \u2014 I went in down \u2014 down to the \u2014 and I found \u2014September 22, 1994\nI found some photographs which I \u2014 which I cherish. And I \u2014 and I have them with\nme so far, you know, so \u2014",
        "A: Of course. I think it was in every place. The only thing is that \u2014 that people \u2014 it\u2019s\nvery hard for people to understand that \u2014 that in Lithuania was \u2014 you see, I don't\nknow about Poland as much, you know \u2014 but in Lithuania, was very difficult to \u2014\nto penetrate and to go through because we have \u2014 we had two layers of \u2014 of \u2014 of\ndifficulties. One was that the Lithuanians were very, very much anti-Semitic in a\nsense, and they would \u2014 they would betray \u2014 most of them, you know, most of\nthem \u2014 betray anybody that tried to hide or that tried to reach something. Because\nmany \u2014 most of my friends were killed by \u2014 were \u2014 were \u2014 were \u2014 I mean, caught\nby \u2014 by Lithuanians. The same time when I \u2014 I was almost caught by a Lithuanian.\nIt was not a German. German wouldn\u2019t know me fr-from \u2014 from nothing, whether I\nam Jewish or not, you know. But they \u2014 they have sense, they have \u2014 they \u2014 they\nwere able to identify. And it was extremely, extremely difficult, and they were not\ncooperative. They \u2014 they didn\u2019t provide you with arms, they betrayed you, they \u2014\n148\nSeptember 22, 1994\nthey did \u2014 they did \u2014 they did everything possible to \u2014 to hurt you rather than to help\nyou. So it was extremely difficult, but it was \u2014 the spirit of resistance was always\nthere. Of course, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t have this \u2014 this help, the necessary \u2014 you have\nto hel \u2014 have to \u2014 you have to have outside help in order \u2014 without outside help, you\ncannot \u2014 you cannot do anything, you know. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not a matter that \u2014\nthat you can serve yourself. Where \u2014 where are you going to get armaments? Where\n\u2014 where are you going to \u2014 I mean, you have to have help, contact. Notwithstanding\nthat \u2014\nEnd of Tape Nine\nConclusion of Interview\n"
