        "Q: Would you please state your name and your birth place for us.",
        "A: My name is Henry Kellerman. I'm a Berliner. I'm a no longer a German. I\ngave up my German citizenship when I left Germany, but I'll always be a Berliner. You\ncan't shake that. I was born in Berlin in 1910 under the great reign of Casmir Wilhelm, II.\nWe were a middle class family, and we went to all the stages and points of interest of a\nupper middle class family. My father was a rabbi in Berlin, which put us in the category\nof, I suppose, really local intellegents here. My mother came from AustraliA: My\nfather was a Bavarian. So, if we ever wanted to talk about a mixed marriage, that will be\nit. My father was far more a philosopher than a theologian. He was a student and became\na collaborator of Herman Korne, and was a member of the so called Marbrook School, a\nschool. He wrote extensively a number of books. The last one he couldn't\nfinish because he died prematurely at the age of 53 in Berlin. We were in those days a\ntypically Russian middle class family with all the necessary qualifications. We were\nbrought up in the German classics. I remember my mother at the age of 86 could still\nquote , and all that she learned in high school. My father was totally\ndevoted to German philosophy and on one the side and to the Jewish prophets on the\nother. His sermons I remember were always on a fairly high intellectual level, and as a\nchild I understood very little of it and later I wondered how many else really grasped the\nmeaning of the message he had to give. He had enormous power of intellect and\noverwhelming. I went to a public school, a gymnasium in Germany, in Berlin, where we\nwere educated according to the very strict rules of German humanism. We learned\nenormously facts and figures. We learned five languages, starting of course with German,\nFrench, English, Greek, Latin. You name it, and naturally integral and French calculus. It\nwas a very profound type of education, but it taught us very little about social values.\nSocial criticism particularly in history was not permissible and we grew up without any\ndefense-- intellectual defense at the time against the powers that were to take over later\non in the 30s. I went for twelve years to the school and graduated in 1928. I then went to\nvarious universities at Berlin, Fribrook and Heidelberg, and eventually made my\ndoctorate degree at the University of Berlin, doctorate of Juris Prudence. The years I\nspent in Berlin, Germany, as a child and as an adolescent were years which really laid the\nfoundation for whatever later on became my professional calling. They were great years\nin many respects. The 20s in Berlin, an unforgettable experience. I remember that the\nsummary referred to that the 20s in Berlin as a so called age of pericles in Berlin. What\nwas offered in terms of art, culture, and literature was unbelievable, and the names I got\nto know in this days on the German stage and the German consulates, unforgettable, and I\ndidn't forget them. Later on, I was fortunate enough to meet some of these prominent\nactors and when I came back to Germany after the war. I believe that this is something\nthat is frequently overlooked, that in the 20s Berlin really seemed to be the cultural\ncapital of Europe. With four operas, 36 legitimate stages, two great symphony orchestras,\na university with high standards of excellence, and with a scientific community which\nincluded Albert Einstein among others. It was paramount to nothing. What came\nafterwards in the 30s was a total collapse of all what we had seen, heard and learned in\nthe 20s. I lived four years under Hitler, and I experienced on the first of April, 1933, the\nday, I lived continued to stay. I continued to stay for a number of reasons. First\nof all I wasn't finished with Germany. It was my hope, which proved to be a total illusion,\nas it was with many other Germans and Jews, that that was a passing phase, and if we had\nthe patience and the will to stay, we would see the end of the Hitler regime. That proved\nto be totally untrue. My second reason was that I had always been a member of the\nJewish Youth Movement in Germany, and I had been in a leading position there, and\nwhen Hitler came and all the young people were thrown out of their German Youth\nOrganizations --",
        "Q: Which German Youth Organizations were you a member of?",
        "A: I will come to that in a minute. We all banded together in one large organization which\nwas called at the time the League of German Jewish Youth, and I became the National\nhead of this organization. By our standards, which were not too large, but there was\n10,000 plus with local chapters all over Germany, which I visited. We operated under\nincreasing restrictions. There were prohibitions all along the road. We couldn't meet\nthere, we couldn't meet there. The Gestapo people came to the private homes where we\nhad our weekly or monthly sessions, and watched us kids discuss Jewish history and\nreligion and took assiduously notes to the terror of the parents. But we were rather not\nphased by this. We put up with it. Then the restrictions became more acute and we had to\nlimit our meetings and eventually the league was dissolved by the Gestapo. Before that,\nwe created a camp, a little more than that, a settlement in Silizea (ph) where we were\ntraining members of our organization for amunication as farmers, as artisans, in other\nwords, in non intellectual pursuits which we felt at that the time might open a new future\nfor these youngsters. I stayed until 1937 and my third reason for staying was I still\nworking on my doctorate dissertation at the University of Berlin. It became more and\nmore precarious and the question, would I be able to make it to the final exam was very\nquestionable. I had a professor at Berlin University who went to battle for me. After the\nNuremberg laws were passed in 1935, he called me in and he said, you know it's very\ndoubtful that you still will be able to pass your exam, but I trust that if there is any\npassions left in this administration, they may remember that they admitted you before and\nthey will feel legally and duty bound to admit you. And he proved to be right. I was\nindeed permitted over the protest of the Dean of the University and probably some\npolitical authorities to take my doctorate exam in 1937 at the University of Berlin, and I\npassed it, and a month later I left for the United States. A few years ago, I remembered\nthat 50 years had passed since my first doctorate examination and it occurred to me that I\nshould find out whether the University of Berlin would grant me my so called Golden\nDoctorate diploma which comes 50 years after. But I was not willing really, to be\nhonored that way by a University that was still under communist control, and I delayed\nmy application until the war came down. After this, I went to my friend in the German\nEmbassy and I said do you think it's practical for me to request that I be granted my",
        "golden doctorate diploma, and he said that's a great ideA: So, the road to Berlin, in fact\nlast year here in October, I went to Berlin and was given the so called golden doctorate\ndiploma by the university. I spoke to 600 law students to tell them a little bit what it was\nlike to grow up in Germany in the 20s and in the 30s. These kids didn't have a clue. It\nwas all completely new to them. The names I mentioned of the people gave distinctive\nreputation to German and specifically Berlin in the 20s. So, now I have my golden\ndoctorate diplomA: Now, I left Germany after as I said after my doctorate exam and\ncame straight to the States. Due largely to the fact that I had met a marvelous man in one\nof our conferences in the offices of the World Union for Progressive Judaism in London,\nMontefiore and Lilly Montegue, and his name was Rabbi Lazerum, and he was the rabbi\nof the Baltimore Hebrew congregation. He would urge me long before to come to the\nUnited States, and finally sent me an affidavit which I needed to gain my entrance into\nthe States. I went to Baltimore and I had a fellowship at John Hopkins University in\nPolitical Economics. Then later I went to New York and had a position with the National\nRefugee Service, where I led a division for social and cultural adjustment, and at the\nsame time studied social work at the New York School of Social Work, and got my\ndiplomA: Then war broke out, and I decided I had to do something about it. I wasn't\neligible immediately because I had three dependents and I was a little too old then. So, I\ndecided to go to Washington to look for a position with any of the war agencies. I was\nrather lucky to find a position as analyst with which was called the Foreign Broadcast\nIntelligence Service. It was part of the Fellow Communications Committee. What we did\nwas to monitor any rebroadcasts mostly and write analyses and send them on to the war\ndepartment or State Department or the White House, where there was need for this kind\nof information. In fact, it included a lot of hard intelligence which was hard to develop.\nMy immediate tutor, mentor, and boss was Doctor Hanzpier, one of the noted\nsociologists who was also from Berlin, who died recently. From Foreign Broadcast\nIntelligence Service I switched over the OSS, the Office of Strategic Services and\nbecame a political analyst there. Then, when was nearing its end, and we began to focus\non postwar targets, and the Nuremberg Trial was mentioned, I was given the job by OSS\nto draft the so called pretrial briefs against the Nazi party, the SS, the SA, the Hitler\nYouths, and I spent about a year trying to get this material together. It proved that we had\nan enormous amount of material, and yet some of the most important documents like the\none document which stipulated the extermination of European Jews was not among them.\nWe must have had it somewhere, but it was not made available at the time. But we had\nplenty of material when we went to Nuremberg. I was sent with a team, a research team,\nunder the leadership of Franz Noriman, one of the other great political analysts who\nemigrated from Germany, and eventually took over his position of chief of research in\nNuremberg where we continued to collect and present evidence for use by the\nprosecution. We were part of the American prosecution in Nuremberg. It was a\nfascinating experience and I've talked about it often and have written about it, and 1t was\nin retrospect I feel a very important and very useful experience. This has been contested\nby many people who have attacked the Nuremberg Trials as having been trial of the\nvictors who were vanquished and trials based on expo facto law. I didn't see any of these\nviews. I think the Nuremberg Trial was a monumental effort, first of all to punish some of\nthe main culprits who were sentenced to death or life long prison sentences. It's recorded\nfor the world to see what the Nazi legacy had been, and it created new international law\nwhich was promulgated as such later on by the United Nations.",
        "Q: Can you give us some specific cases that you worked on and some of the people that you\nworked with?",
        "A: Well, we tried for one thing, Bill Donovan, who was the head of the OSS and my boss,\nand I worked together in Nuremberg and we tried to break down the testimony of\nHerman Goering, who was the prima dona of the trial. It was enormously difficult.\nGoering was a man of extreme intelligence. We gave him ani.Q: | test, all the\ndefendants, and Goering and , a former minister of finance and potentially\nfor the war effort emerged in the genius category. There came the day when we presented\nthe structure and the pogrom of the party to the bench. A young mayor, not so young, a\nmayor whose name shall not be mentioned, was given the task of presenting the evidence\nagainst Goering and the rest. The mayor was a man who had studied the record, but it\nhadn't sunk in, so I had to coach him for the job, and I presented him with a chart of the\nparty, and he said when you introduce the party tomorrow will you please point out that\nGoering was the number one deputy of Hitler, and that Hess was number two and then\nfollow up with the rest of hierarchy. He couldn't grasp it. I would say now repeat after\nme, Goering number one, Hess number two. And he would say all right, if the Court\nplease the head deputy was Mr. Hess and Goering was number two. It went on and on.\nHe couldn't get it straight until at midnight I thought he had it right. So, the next morning\nwe assembled in the courtroom and the mayor stepped forward and said, if the court\nplease, I will introduce now the charter, and as shown on this chart here of the party, we\nsaid number one deputy was Mr. Hess, number two was Goering. You should have seen\nGoering. He got light in the face. He shook his hand. He waived pieces of paper and I\nsaid we have to do something. I sent a piece of paper up to the good mayor and said\nMajor would you please correct yourself and ask the person on the bench to listen to you,\nyou made a mistake. He stopped and looked down and he said oh, if the court will permit\nme, number one deputy was Goering. You should have seen Goering. He was pleased as\npie, and that was only a few weeks before he committed suicide. But if he went down, he\nwent down with flying colors. Another thing which I remember which was important I\nthink. At one point, when we showed the film, the death mills, which is documentary we\nfound showing some of the concentration camps and showing some of the scenes from\nthe Ghetto in Warsaw, we darkened the courtroom and had only lights shining on the\nfaces of the 22 defendants. And I had opportunity to study the faces while that film was\nshown and all that brutality and it was amazing how they fell apart. Goering never looked\nat it. Neither did Hess. Schott who maintained all through the trial that he had nothing to\ndo with the atrocities, turned his back to the screen and crossed his arms in front of him\nto indicate that he had been an absentee during the Nazi period. Franz, the butcher of\nPoland broke into tears. So, did Salkin, who was the labor czar. The only person who\nlooked at the screen with obvious glee and pleasure was Streicher who was the so called\ngall leader in Bavaria, Franconia, and who had been the editor and publisher of this filthy\nrag the Stormer, Storm Trooper you might call it. This was his show. He felt that he was\nvindicated completely by that picture. He also was the one, he was sentenced to death\nwho allegedly, I wasn't there, shortly before his execution said to the executioner now\nyou have your poem after all. He knew his Jewish calendar obviously. Now, those are\nscenes from Nuremberg. I do remember many others that may be worth quoting, but the\ntrial itself was conducted by a bench which was divided in four parts, two American\njudges, two Soviet judges, two French judges and two Russian judges. They were not in\nagreement all of the time. That was obvious, but still the proceedings were conducted\nwith utter dignity and decorum and I'll never forget the opening statement of the\npresiding judge, Judge Lawrence from Great Britain that this was a trial to be conducted\nwithout fear or favor. And it was. We had a galaxy of lawyers, SS prosecutors, as well as\ndefendants and judges of course. The judgment was to many disappointing although\nsome of them the guilty one including the military, top military were sentenced to death. I\ncarried away from Nuremberg the conviction that I had attended an event that would go\ndown in history as one of the probably most remarkable demonstrations of international\njustice, and I still feel that same way about it. Although I will admit that the major\npurposes of Nuremberg to protect peace and to ban genocide and anti-semitism have not\nyet been met and probably will not for some time to come.",
        "Q: Can we digress for a second and go back to your role as to exactly you did for\npreparation of this trial and who you interacted with?",
        "A: Well, I interrogated quite a few of the defendants and also as I mentioned before wrote\nthese pretrial briefs in which I packed all the evidence we had at the time on the felonies\nof the party leaders, the so called leadership core, the SS, the SA also many of these\nthings came to light after the trial including the one document as I mentioned. I was chief\nof research. That was my title in Nuremberg. I had a staff of a dozen people, most of\nthem members of the Office of Strategic Services, including such upstanding lawyers as\nJohn Herz, who was part of it, and was a professor in New York, later. And we just\ncollected the evidence and some of the evidence that came to us in the most peculiar\nways I remember that one day a reporter from the New York times, came in my office\nand said I understand you're responsible here for collection of evidence. I was in Berlin. I\nwent to the Chancellory, Hitler's Chancellory which was a heap of rubble of course in\nthose days. I looked around and there were a lot of papers and I picked some up. I don't\nread German. I have no idea what I picked up. I'd like you to take a look at it, and he\nhanded me a piece of paper that was slightly torn and singed of course, but low and\nbehold there was the order from the SA party judge for the so called crystal night to the\nSA: You know it was long denied that that was any organized effort. It was always as\nthe used to call it, the boiling soul of the people who did it, but far from it.\nThere was the order, black and white for the SA to get busy and set the torch in the\nsynagogues and homes and shops of Jews.",
        "Q: Can you tell us whose interviews you participated in?",
        "A: Well, one I remember quite distinctly was who was the head of the labor\nfarm and he was a sad sap by the time they got to him, he was obviously ill. His eyes\nwere tearing, his nose was flooding liberally, and I presented him with the chart of the\nparty and said now you were the leader of the organization, tell me whether this is correct\nthe way we put it together, and Lyle looked at it and he said well yes it is correct. It is\ncorrect, but that doesn't in any way reflect the reality. This was a dynamic organization\nand you cannot put it into boxes straight lines and vertical lines and what not. He then\nbegan to take my fountain pen to draw weird circles within circles and said this is the\ndynamism, unless you catch it you can't catch us. Two days later he was dead. He\nobviously had committed suicide. That was one example. Then there was a real red neck\nI got this SS leader from the eastern front, a fellow by the name of , and I\nconfronted him with some of the atrocities that were committed by the SS in southern\nRussia and he looked at it and looked at it and said I don't understand how can you\npeople know these things, you must have a terrific staff. I don't know whether he tried to\nfind out in order to get a favorable consideration or not, but he was one of the worst\nbutchers. And then the other one, I will remember and never forget was a fellow by the\nname of . He was -- he referred to himself as the butcher of Warsaw. He\nwas an SS man, and he said I want to be confronted with some of the generals. We got\nhim together with General , the tank general and a general by the name of\n. He said to us, I know what we did in Russia, but he said, but I'll be\ndarned if I take the blame all by myself. We generals here we are just as guilty. They\nparticipated, they had the regular army and they worked with us in some of the\nammunition of the minorities in southern RussiA: absolutely denied it. I\nhave never known, but I don't believe it. went to the collapse, and I have\nit black and white. It's in the archives, and said in German ;\nhave we tried in Germany and knew it. I don't think the children in Germany knew much\nwas going on in the eastern front although they may have heard rumors to the effect, but\nwas sentenced to prison. He didn't stay very long. He was liberated,\nwas put back again, and died eventually. So, those are some of the vignettes from\nNuremberg. There were many more. I could go on forever telling you stories. I would\nlike to perhaps finish by saying this. The punishment of the guilty was of course one of\nthe post war targets and I had the satisfaction of being part of that, but I always felt that\nthis was not enough. I remembered the days of Weimer, where a fledgling democracy\nwas trying to come to the fore, and found very little sympathy outside Germany. The\nunbelievable reparation which were astronomical and which were never paid as a result\nof it, prevented not only the flourishing of the democracy but increased of course the\nstrengths of the reactionary forces which eventually gave birth to the Nazis. The Weimer\nrepublic not a very experienced democracy and not very strong, collapsed. And my\nfeeling, the feeling of some of our friends was that this must not happen a second time,\nand that after World War II as against World War I we would have a duty to encourage\nand force the democratic elements in Germany if anyone could be found. They could be\nfound. We found people like Audenaur. We found people like the mayor of Berlin,\n, and many, many others whom I got to meet after the war. And we\ndecided that in order to help them, we not only had to sanitize Germany economically, it",
        "was the Marshall plan, but we had to do something also for the education of the new\ngeneration. And out of this came the so-called re-education program, which was at the\ntime was a multi million dollar program. Today you would have to put the equivalent of\nbillions for the kind of help that we had at our disposal. I was appointed in the State\nDepartment, Director of this program. We decided that one of the most important things\nto do was to get some of the young Germans, students, teachers, high school students\neven to come over to the States and have them stay here for a while to get to know what\ndemocracy looked like seeing not only from the federal but from the local level, and we\nrecreated a so-called leadership program where practically all the leading members in\npolitics, in the law, in the professions were invited to come to the States, including future\npresidents and chancellors of Germany. And in order to give them a chance to observe\nwhat they found here and if possible to apply it on their return to Germany. This was a\nprogram, I remember sitting here one night, at Pennsylvania Avenue, in offices and\ndecided what this program should be like. The total exchange program of the United\nStates in those days was a few hundred and we are mostly Chinese students for some\nreason, I don't remember what it was. I said now we have to do much more here. I turned\nto the staff and I said we've never done it before, what would you think of a figure of\n2,000. And of all people, my budget man spoke up and said 2,000, why not 3,000? Why\nnot 3,500? I said do you think we can do it? He said I have no ideA: We should try,\nand we did. We did within a short span of years about 13,000 people involved in this\nexchange program. Most of them came from Germany to the States and experts and\nteachers and political advisors went to Germany. Then later we extended it to other\nEuropean countries. We paid for it, and it's still going, although most of it today is on a\nprivate basis. But this exchange program really must be given for quite a bit of credit for\nwhat really happened in terms of political reform in Germany on the federal, state and\nlocal level. That is the sort of thing we failed to do in the 20s. And I felt very strongly,\nwell I wasn't the only one, this mistake had to be corrected after World War II. It must\nnot be permitted again. And we found people like -- well not General Clay. General Clay\nin the beginning had doubts. General Clay felt that he had so much money available and\nthat had to be spent for economic purposes. He kept saying you cannot teach democracy\non an empty stomach. We had to agree with him, but no need to do one thing without the\nother. Well, he had concerns that German students coming to the United States would be\nexposed to a lot of unpleasant personal experiences. It turned out to be totally wrong. We\nhardly ever had a single unpleasant experience among all these thousands of people who\ncame over here, and we have proved to show it. These returning exchanges were\nresponsible for a number of very important reforms in Germany. For instance, a group of\nparliamentary deputies, German , came to Washington and they said\nwe have a terrible time because we are having what they call the chancellor democracy.\nThe chancellor can legislate whatever he wants to and we really have no resources in any\nform or fashion to compete with it. We need to. So, we sent him to what then was a\nlegislative Library of Congress. Legislative Reference Service of Congress and he came\nback he said that's just what we have to have. A staff organization where we can prepare\nour own legislation and where we don't have to take everything that the administration\nsends to us on our hill and they created it. And they created as a result of it a balance\nbetween the German chancellorship and the German parliament. That was one thing.\nAnother thing is they were preparing a new law for the military and we invited the whole\ncommittee which was preparing this law to come to the States to make it show two\nthings. First of all, the problem of civilian control over the military and how we protected\nthe rights of the individual soldier against any intervention from the top. They came. We\ntook them all over the country. We opened the resources for him. We went back and\nmade a very good law which is still in existence so those were some of the things that we\ntried to do with our so called re-education program. Incidentally let me say I never liked\nmuch the term re-education. It was really more to soften the American taxpayer than to\nappease the Germans and we later renamed it re-orientation which was not only\nappreciated but highly praised program and the German Parliament passed a resolution\nthanking us for what we did there.",
        "Q: Can I ask you your comparison between the trial that you participated in and the\nsubsequent trials?",
        "A: Well, the subsequent trials really fell apart. If you want to see the documents as I read\nTelford Taylor's book and I was invited to go back as deputy to Telford Taylor for the\nsecond trial and I didn't do so. I was so advised in fact by my old boss Bill Donovan of\n, and it turned out that some of the trials were good and some of it is\ndocumented among other things in this marvelous picture I've seen three or four times,\nJudgment in Nuremberg, with Spencer Tracy and Lancaster which more or less gave you\nthe flavor and philosophy of what really was I suppose the purpose of these trials. But in\nmany cases they just collapsed. In some cases, the Germans proved to be tougher than\nwe. For instance, the court in Nuremberg acquitted Schott, which I thought was a major\nmistake at the time, but the Germans put him in jail afterwards. So, there were some trials\nthat worked out right, but on the whole what came afterwards ended very often in\nacquittals and in minor penalties and never reached the level of the .",
        "Q: Could you describe the structure of the American prosecution team?",
        "A: Well, the American prosecution, which I thought was a very good one, was headed by\nJustice Jackson. He was the chief prosecutor and he made a magnificent opening\nstatement at the time. His deputy was General William Donovan. Old Bill Donovan of\nthe fighting 69s of World War I, and then the rest of the group was composed of lawyers\nfrom the Judge Advocate Office of members of the OSS like myself, of Navy officers,\nArmy officers, most of them with the exceptions of the OSS members, were in uniform. I\nwore a uniform but more for ornamental purposes. I was what they called a major at the\ntime, I believe. But they were a military tribunal after all. You saw the defense of course\nwas not in uniform and the bench wasn't except I believe the Russian judges were in\nuniform. Not the Americans, and not the French, certainly not the British.",
        "Q: In preparation of these trials did you visit any of the concentration camps?",
        "A: Not in preparation, but while I was in Nuremberg, I took time off to go to Dachau\nconcentration camp, which was only a few miles down from Nuremberg. I went there.\nWe had a guided tour by I think one of the former inmates. We went through the famous\ngate, \"Labor Makes You Free\" or something like it. We went there. They showed us\nsome of the ovens. In one of them I still detected some bones. They showed us the\ncourtyard where the prisoners were torn apart by dogs and they showed us the barracks.\nThat was after all a few months after the so-called liberation. That was an experience that\nno one can forget. I know that Eisenhower went there too at the time, well a few months\nearlier. Yes, I saw that, but I never saw the concentration camps in the east.",
        "Q: Did you interview any of the survivors?",
        "A: Oh, many of them, yes. Some of them were friends who suddenly emerged in\nNuremberg. One was quite well known, Norbert Wllheim, who is one of the key figures\nnow in the Holocaust program. He was in Dachau. His son and his former wife were\ngassed. He survived and he went free, escaped, and got back to West Germany and is\nnow in the States and I see him infrequently. He lives in New York. I see many others\ntoo, and their stories are invariably the same. There are no six million lies, believe me.\nWell, that's more or less. I went eventually into the diplomatic service because I thought\nthe two things I wanted to do for in German affairs were punishment of the guilty and the\nresurrection of the democrats. I had done as much as I thought I could do and I went to\nDiplomatic Service and I was acting ambassador in Switzerland to and\neventually concluded my diplomatic career working for the environment. I was the first\nspecial assistant in the State Department for Environmental Affairs.",
        "Q: Is there any final comment that you'd like to make concerning your experience.",
        "A: Well, I have made all the comments I wanted to make. A manuscript which hasn't been\npublished yet in which I recounted for them my time from my childhood in Imperial\nGermany, in the Weimer Republic, in the Third Reich, to the war and the post war period\nand I believe that I don't claim any special credits for anything I've done but in a form,\nbut in a way at least in it's first part, my life was the life of a quintessential German Jew\nwho reaped all the benefits Germany had to offer in the early times and also witness and\nwas victimized by the horrific collapse of all values we cherish under Hitler. I've no\nregrets that I saw it. We were typical as I said in the beginning, German Jewish middle\nclass frapling, and not only we but going back to my grandparents. My grandfather on my\nmother's side was a who fought twice for his king against Denmark and\nAustria and was in fact imprisoned and returned, triumphantly, I suppose to his little\ntown in Rastrailia where he became the king of all marksman. He was a very good\nmarksman, and they had an annual fair there and he never failed to get the crown. He was\nas German and Jewish as they come. So was the whole family, all of them stuck to their\nloyalties and to their convictions throughout World War I and World War II and\nthereafter. All of them of that generation are now gone.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "A: Well, we tried for one thing, Bill Donovan, who was the head of the OSS and my boss,\nand I worked together in Nuremberg and we tried to break down the testimony of\nHerman Goering, who was the prima dona of the trial. It was enormously difficult.\nGoering was a man of extreme intelligence. We gave him ani.Q: | test, all the\ndefendants, and Goering and , a former minister of finance and potentially\nfor the war effort emerged in the genius category. There came the day when we presented\nthe structure and the pogrom of the party to the bench. A young mayor, not so young, a\nmayor whose name shall not be mentioned, was given the task of presenting the evidence\nagainst Goering and the rest. The mayor was a man who had studied the record, but it\nhadn't sunk in, so I had to coach him for the job, and I presented him with a chart of the\nparty, and he said when you introduce the party tomorrow will you please point out that\nGoering was the number one deputy of Hitler, and that Hess was number two and then\nfollow up with the rest of hierarchy. He couldn't grasp it. I would say now repeat after\nme, Goering number one, Hess number two. And he would say all right, if the Court\nplease the head deputy was Mr. Hess and Goering was number two. It went on and on.\nHe couldn't get it straight until at midnight I thought he had it right. So, the next morning\nwe assembled in the courtroom and the mayor stepped forward and said, if the court\nplease, I will introduce now the charter, and as shown on this chart here of the party, we\nsaid number one deputy was Mr. Hess, number two was Goering. You should have seen\nGoering. He got light in the face. He shook his hand. He waived pieces of paper and I\nsaid we have to do something. I sent a piece of paper up to the good mayor and said\nMajor would you please correct yourself and ask the person on the bench to listen to you,\nyou made a mistake. He stopped and looked down and he said oh, if the court will permit\nme, number one deputy was Goering. You should have seen Goering. He was pleased as\npie, and that was only a few weeks before he committed suicide. But if he went down, he\nwent down with flying colors. Another thing which I remember which was important I\nthink. At one point, when we showed the film, the death mills, which is documentary we\nfound showing some of the concentration camps and showing some of the scenes from\nthe Ghetto in Warsaw, we darkened the courtroom and had only lights shining on the\nfaces of the 22 defendants. And I had opportunity to study the faces while that film was\nshown and all that brutality and it was amazing how they fell apart. Goering never looked\nat it. Neither did Hess. Schott who maintained all through the trial that he had nothing to\ndo with the atrocities, turned his back to the screen and crossed his arms in front of him\nto indicate that he had been an absentee during the Nazi period. Franz, the butcher of\nPoland broke into tears. So, did Salkin, who was the labor czar. The only person who\nlooked at the screen with obvious glee and pleasure was Streicher who was the so called\ngall leader in Bavaria, Franconia, and who had been the editor and publisher of this filthy",

        "A: My name is Henry Kellerman. I'm a Berliner. I'm a no longer a German. I\ngave up my German citizenship when I left Germany, but I'll always be a Berliner. You\ncan't shake that. I was born in Berlin in 1910 under the great reign of Casmir Wilhelm, II.\nWe were a middle class family, and we went to all the stages and points of interest of a\nupper middle class family. My father was a rabbi in Berlin, which put us in the category\nof, I suppose, really local intellegents here. My mother came from AustraliA: My\nfather was a Bavarian. So, if we ever wanted to talk about a mixed marriage, that will be\nit. My father was far more a philosopher than a theologian. He was a student and became\na collaborator of Herman Korne, and was a member of the so called Marbrook School, a\nschool. He wrote extensively a number of books. The last one he couldn't\nfinish because he died prematurely at the age of 53 in Berlin. We were in those days a\ntypically Russian middle class family with all the necessary qualifications. We were\nbrought up in the German classics. I remember my mother at the age of 86 could still\nquote , and all that she learned in high school. My father was totally\ndevoted to German philosophy and on one the side and to the Jewish prophets on the\nother. His sermons I remember were always on a fairly high intellectual level, and as a\nchild I understood very little of it and later I wondered how many else really grasped the\nmeaning of the message he had to give. He had enormous power of intellect and\noverwhelming. I went to a public school, a gymnasium in Germany, in Berlin, where we\nwere educated according to the very strict rules of German humanism. We learned\nenormously facts and figures. We learned five languages, starting of course with German,\nFrench, English, Greek, Latin. You name it, and naturally integral and French calculus. It\nwas a very profound type of education, but it taught us very little about social values.\nSocial criticism particularly in history was not permissible and we grew up without any\ndefense-- intellectual defense at the time against the powers that were to take over later\non in the 30s. I went for twelve years to the school and graduated in 1928. I then went to\nvarious universities at Berlin, Fribrook and Heidelberg, and eventually made my\ndoctorate degree at the University of Berlin, doctorate of Juris Prudence. The years I\nspent in Berlin, Germany, as a child and as an adolescent were years which really laid the\nfoundation for whatever later on became my professional calling. They were great years\nin many respects. The 20s in Berlin, an unforgettable experience. I remember that the\nsummary referred to that the 20s in Berlin as a so called age of pericles in Berlin. What\nwas offered in terms of art, culture, and literature was unbelievable, and the names I got\nto know in this days on the German stage and the German consulates, unforgettable, and I\ndidn't forget them. Later on, I was fortunate enough to meet some of these prominent\nactors and when I came back to Germany after the war. I believe that this is something\nthat is frequently overlooked, that in the 20s Berlin really seemed to be the cultural\ncapital of Europe. With four operas, 36 legitimate stages, two great symphony orchestras,\na university with high standards of excellence, and with a scientific community which\nincluded Albert Einstein among others. It was paramount to nothing. What came\nafterwards in the 30s was a total collapse of all what we had seen, heard and learned in\nthe 20s. I lived four years under Hitler, and I experienced on the first of April, 1933, the\nday, I lived continued to stay. I continued to stay for a number of reasons. First\nof all I wasn't finished with Germany. It was my hope, which proved to be a total illusion,\nas it was with many other Germans and Jews, that that was a passing phase, and if we had\nthe patience and the will to stay, we would see the end of the Hitler regime. That proved\nto be totally untrue. My second reason was that I had always been a member of the\nJewish Youth Movement in Germany, and I had been in a leading position there, and\nwhen Hitler came and all the young people were thrown out of their German Youth\nOrganizations --",
        "A: I will come to that in a minute. We all banded together in one large organization which\nwas called at the time the League of German Jewish Youth, and I became the National\nhead of this organization. By our standards, which were not too large, but there was\n10,000 plus with local chapters all over Germany, which I visited. We operated under\nincreasing restrictions. There were prohibitions all along the road. We couldn't meet\nthere, we couldn't meet there. The Gestapo people came to the private homes where we\nhad our weekly or monthly sessions, and watched us kids discuss Jewish history and\nreligion and took assiduously notes to the terror of the parents. But we were rather not\nphased by this. We put up with it. Then the restrictions became more acute and we had to\nlimit our meetings and eventually the league was dissolved by the Gestapo. Before that,\nwe created a camp, a little more than that, a settlement in Silizea (ph) where we were\ntraining members of our organization for amunication as farmers, as artisans, in other\nwords, in non intellectual pursuits which we felt at that the time might open a new future\nfor these youngsters. I stayed until 1937 and my third reason for staying was I still\nworking on my doctorate dissertation at the University of Berlin. It became more and\nmore precarious and the question, would I be able to make it to the final exam was very\nquestionable. I had a professor at Berlin University who went to battle for me. After the\nNuremberg laws were passed in 1935, he called me in and he said, you know it's very\ndoubtful that you still will be able to pass your exam, but I trust that if there is any\npassions left in this administration, they may remember that they admitted you before and\nthey will feel legally and duty bound to admit you. And he proved to be right. I was\nindeed permitted over the protest of the Dean of the University and probably some\npolitical authorities to take my doctorate exam in 1937 at the University of Berlin, and I\npassed it, and a month later I left for the United States. A few years ago, I remembered\nthat 50 years had passed since my first doctorate examination and it occurred to me that I\nshould find out whether the University of Berlin would grant me my so called Golden\nDoctorate diploma which comes 50 years after. But I was not willing really, to be\nhonored that way by a University that was still under communist control, and I delayed\nmy application until the war came down. After this, I went to my friend in the German\nEmbassy and I said do you think it's practical for me to request that I be granted my",
        "golden doctorate diploma, and he said that's a great ideA: So, the road to Berlin, in fact\nlast year here in October, I went to Berlin and was given the so called golden doctorate\ndiploma by the university. I spoke to 600 law students to tell them a little bit what it was\nlike to grow up in Germany in the 20s and in the 30s. These kids didn't have a clue. It\nwas all completely new to them. The names I mentioned of the people gave distinctive\nreputation to German and specifically Berlin in the 20s. So, now I have my golden\ndoctorate diplomA: Now, I left Germany after as I said after my doctorate exam and\ncame straight to the States. Due largely to the fact that I had met a marvelous man in one\nof our conferences in the offices of the World Union for Progressive Judaism in London,\nMontefiore and Lilly Montegue, and his name was Rabbi Lazerum, and he was the rabbi\nof the Baltimore Hebrew congregation. He would urge me long before to come to the\nUnited States, and finally sent me an affidavit which I needed to gain my entrance into\nthe States. I went to Baltimore and I had a fellowship at John Hopkins University in\nPolitical Economics. Then later I went to New York and had a position with the National\nRefugee Service, where I led a division for social and cultural adjustment, and at the\nsame time studied social work at the New York School of Social Work, and got my\ndiplomA: Then war broke out, and I decided I had to do something about it. I wasn't\neligible immediately because I had three dependents and I was a little too old then. So, I\ndecided to go to Washington to look for a position with any of the war agencies. I was\nrather lucky to find a position as analyst with which was called the Foreign Broadcast\nIntelligence Service. It was part of the Fellow Communications Committee. What we did\nwas to monitor any rebroadcasts mostly and write analyses and send them on to the war\ndepartment or State Department or the White House, where there was need for this kind\nof information. In fact, it included a lot of hard intelligence which was hard to develop.\nMy immediate tutor, mentor, and boss was Doctor Hanzpier, one of the noted\nsociologists who was also from Berlin, who died recently. From Foreign Broadcast\nIntelligence Service I switched over the OSS, the Office of Strategic Services and\nbecame a political analyst there. Then, when was nearing its end, and we began to focus\non postwar targets, and the Nuremberg Trial was mentioned, I was given the job by OSS\nto draft the so called pretrial briefs against the Nazi party, the SS, the SA, the Hitler\nYouths, and I spent about a year trying to get this material together. It proved that we had\nan enormous amount of material, and yet some of the most important documents like the\none document which stipulated the extermination of European Jews was not among them.\nWe must have had it somewhere, but it was not made available at the time. But we had\nplenty of material when we went to Nuremberg. I was sent with a team, a research team,\nunder the leadership of Franz Noriman, one of the other great political analysts who\nemigrated from Germany, and eventually took over his position of chief of research in\nNuremberg where we continued to collect and present evidence for use by the\nprosecution. We were part of the American prosecution in Nuremberg. It was a\nfascinating experience and I've talked about it often and have written about it, and 1t was\nin retrospect I feel a very important and very useful experience. This has been contested\nby many people who have attacked the Nuremberg Trials as having been trial of the\nvictors who were vanquished and trials based on expo facto law. I didn't see any of these\nviews. I think the Nuremberg Trial was a monumental effort, first of all to punish some of\nthe main culprits who were sentenced to death or life long prison sentences. It's recorded\nfor the world to see what the Nazi legacy had been, and it created new international law\nwhich was promulgated as such later on by the United Nations.\nrag the Stormer, Storm Trooper you might call it. This was his show. He felt that he was\nvindicated completely by that picture. He also was the one, he was sentenced to death\nwho allegedly, I wasn't there, shortly before his execution said to the executioner now\nyou have your poem after all. He knew his Jewish calendar obviously. Now, those are\nscenes from Nuremberg. I do remember many others that may be worth quoting, but the\ntrial itself was conducted by a bench which was divided in four parts, two American\njudges, two Soviet judges, two French judges and two Russian judges. They were not in\nagreement all of the time. That was obvious, but still the proceedings were conducted\nwith utter dignity and decorum and I'll never forget the opening statement of the\npresiding judge, Judge Lawrence from Great Britain that this was a trial to be conducted\nwithout fear or favor. And it was. We had a galaxy of lawyers, SS prosecutors, as well as\ndefendants and judges of course. The judgment was to many disappointing although\nsome of them the guilty one including the military, top military were sentenced to death. I\ncarried away from Nuremberg the conviction that I had attended an event that would go\ndown in history as one of the probably most remarkable demonstrations of international\njustice, and I still feel that same way about it. Although I will admit that the major\npurposes of Nuremberg to protect peace and to ban genocide and anti-semitism have not\nyet been met and probably will not for some time to come.",
        "A: Well, I interrogated quite a few of the defendants and also as I mentioned before wrote\nthese pretrial briefs in which I packed all the evidence we had at the time on the felonies\nof the party leaders, the so called leadership core, the SS, the SA also many of these\nthings came to light after the trial including the one document as I mentioned. I was chief\nof research. That was my title in Nuremberg. I had a staff of a dozen people, most of\nthem members of the Office of Strategic Services, including such upstanding lawyers as\nJohn Herz, who was part of it, and was a professor in New York, later. And we just\ncollected the evidence and some of the evidence that came to us in the most peculiar\nways I remember that one day a reporter from the New York times, came in my office\nand said I understand you're responsible here for collection of evidence. I was in Berlin. I\nwent to the Chancellory, Hitler's Chancellory which was a heap of rubble of course in\nthose days. I looked around and there were a lot of papers and I picked some up. I don't\nread German. I have no idea what I picked up. I'd like you to take a look at it, and he\nhanded me a piece of paper that was slightly torn and singed of course, but low and\nbehold there was the order from the SA party judge for the so called crystal night to the\nSA: You know it was long denied that that was any organized effort. It was always as\nthe used to call it, the boiling soul of the people who did it, but far from it.\nThere was the order, black and white for the SA to get busy and set the torch in the\nsynagogues and homes and shops of Jews.",
        "A: Well, one I remember quite distinctly was who was the head of the labor\nfarm and he was a sad sap by the time they got to him, he was obviously ill. His eyes\nwere tearing, his nose was flooding liberally, and I presented him with the chart of the\nparty and said now you were the leader of the organization, tell me whether this is correct\nthe way we put it together, and Lyle looked at it and he said well yes it is correct. It is\ncorrect, but that doesn't in any way reflect the reality. This was a dynamic organization\nand you cannot put it into boxes straight lines and vertical lines and what not. He then\nbegan to take my fountain pen to draw weird circles within circles and said this is the\ndynamism, unless you catch it you can't catch us. Two days later he was dead. He\nobviously had committed suicide. That was one example. Then there was a real red neck\nI got this SS leader from the eastern front, a fellow by the name of , and I\nconfronted him with some of the atrocities that were committed by the SS in southern\nRussia and he looked at it and looked at it and said I don't understand how can you\npeople know these things, you must have a terrific staff. I don't know whether he tried to\nfind out in order to get a favorable consideration or not, but he was one of the worst\nbutchers. And then the other one, I will remember and never forget was a fellow by the\nname of . He was -- he referred to himself as the butcher of Warsaw. He\nwas an SS man, and he said I want to be confronted with some of the generals. We got\nhim together with General , the tank general and a general by the name of\n. He said to us, I know what we did in Russia, but he said, but I'll be\ndarned if I take the blame all by myself. We generals here we are just as guilty. They\nparticipated, they had the regular army and they worked with us in some of the\nammunition of the minorities in southern RussiA: absolutely denied it. I\nhave never known, but I don't believe it. went to the collapse, and I have\nit black and white. It's in the archives, and said in German ;\nhave we tried in Germany and knew it. I don't think the children in Germany knew much\nwas going on in the eastern front although they may have heard rumors to the effect, but\nwas sentenced to prison. He didn't stay very long. He was liberated,\nwas put back again, and died eventually. So, those are some of the vignettes from\nNuremberg. There were many more. I could go on forever telling you stories. I would\nlike to perhaps finish by saying this. The punishment of the guilty was of course one of\nthe post war targets and I had the satisfaction of being part of that, but I always felt that\nthis was not enough. I remembered the days of Weimer, where a fledgling democracy\nwas trying to come to the fore, and found very little sympathy outside Germany. The\nunbelievable reparation which were astronomical and which were never paid as a result\nof it, prevented not only the flourishing of the democracy but increased of course the\nstrengths of the reactionary forces which eventually gave birth to the Nazis. The Weimer\nrepublic not a very experienced democracy and not very strong, collapsed. And my\nfeeling, the feeling of some of our friends was that this must not happen a second time,\nand that after World War II as against World War I we would have a duty to encourage\nand force the democratic elements in Germany if anyone could be found. They could be\nfound. We found people like Audenaur. We found people like the mayor of Berlin,\n, and many, many others whom I got to meet after the war. And we\ndecided that in order to help them, we not only had to sanitize Germany economically, it",
        "was the Marshall plan, but we had to do something also for the education of the new\ngeneration. And out of this came the so-called re-education program, which was at the\ntime was a multi million dollar program. Today you would have to put the equivalent of\nbillions for the kind of help that we had at our disposal. I was appointed in the State\nDepartment, Director of this program. We decided that one of the most important things\nto do was to get some of the young Germans, students, teachers, high school students\neven to come over to the States and have them stay here for a while to get to know what\ndemocracy looked like seeing not only from the federal but from the local level, and we\nrecreated a so-called leadership program where practically all the leading members in\npolitics, in the law, in the professions were invited to come to the States, including future\npresidents and chancellors of Germany. And in order to give them a chance to observe\nwhat they found here and if possible to apply it on their return to Germany. This was a\nprogram, I remember sitting here one night, at Pennsylvania Avenue, in offices and\ndecided what this program should be like. The total exchange program of the United\nStates in those days was a few hundred and we are mostly Chinese students for some\nreason, I don't remember what it was. I said now we have to do much more here. I turned\nto the staff and I said we've never done it before, what would you think of a figure of\n2,000. And of all people, my budget man spoke up and said 2,000, why not 3,000? Why\nnot 3,500? I said do you think we can do it? He said I have no ideA: We should try,\nand we did. We did within a short span of years about 13,000 people involved in this\nexchange program. Most of them came from Germany to the States and experts and\nteachers and political advisors went to Germany. Then later we extended it to other\nEuropean countries. We paid for it, and it's still going, although most of it today is on a\nprivate basis. But this exchange program really must be given for quite a bit of credit for\nwhat really happened in terms of political reform in Germany on the federal, state and\nlocal level. That is the sort of thing we failed to do in the 20s. And I felt very strongly,\nwell I wasn't the only one, this mistake had to be corrected after World War II. It must\nnot be permitted again. And we found people like -- well not General Clay. General Clay\nin the beginning had doubts. General Clay felt that he had so much money available and\nthat had to be spent for economic purposes. He kept saying you cannot teach democracy\non an empty stomach. We had to agree with him, but no need to do one thing without the\nother. Well, he had concerns that German students coming to the United States would be\nexposed to a lot of unpleasant personal experiences. It turned out to be totally wrong. We\nhardly ever had a single unpleasant experience among all these thousands of people who\ncame over here, and we have proved to show it. These returning exchanges were\nresponsible for a number of very important reforms in Germany. For instance, a group of\nparliamentary deputies, German , came to Washington and they said\nwe have a terrible time because we are having what they call the chancellor democracy.\nThe chancellor can legislate whatever he wants to and we really have no resources in any\nform or fashion to compete with it. We need to. So, we sent him to what then was a\nlegislative Library of Congress. Legislative Reference Service of Congress and he came\nback he said that's just what we have to have. A staff organization where we can prepare\nour own legislation and where we don't have to take everything that the administration\nsends to us on our hill and they created it. And they created as a result of it a balance\nbetween the German chancellorship and the German parliament. That was one thing.\nAnother thing is they were preparing a new law for the military and we invited the whole\ncommittee which was preparing this law to come to the States to make it show two\nthings. First of all, the problem of civilian control over the military and how we protected\nthe rights of the individual soldier against any intervention from the top. They came. We\ntook them all over the country. We opened the resources for him. We went back and\nmade a very good law which is still in existence so those were some of the things that we\ntried to do with our so called re-education program. Incidentally let me say I never liked\nmuch the term re-education. It was really more to soften the American taxpayer than to\nappease the Germans and we later renamed it re-orientation which was not only\nappreciated but highly praised program and the German Parliament passed a resolution\nthanking us for what we did there.",
        "A: Well, the subsequent trials really fell apart. If you want to see the documents as I read\nTelford Taylor's book and I was invited to go back as deputy to Telford Taylor for the\nsecond trial and I didn't do so. I was so advised in fact by my old boss Bill Donovan of\n, and it turned out that some of the trials were good and some of it is\ndocumented among other things in this marvelous picture I've seen three or four times,\nJudgment in Nuremberg, with Spencer Tracy and Lancaster which more or less gave you\nthe flavor and philosophy of what really was I suppose the purpose of these trials. But in\nmany cases they just collapsed. In some cases, the Germans proved to be tougher than\nwe. For instance, the court in Nuremberg acquitted Schott, which I thought was a major\nmistake at the time, but the Germans put him in jail afterwards. So, there were some trials\nthat worked out right, but on the whole what came afterwards ended very often in\nacquittals and in minor penalties and never reached the level of the .",
        "A: Well, the American prosecution, which I thought was a very good one, was headed by\nJustice Jackson. He was the chief prosecutor and he made a magnificent opening\nstatement at the time. His deputy was General William Donovan. Old Bill Donovan of\nthe fighting 69s of World War I, and then the rest of the group was composed of lawyers\nfrom the Judge Advocate Office of members of the OSS like myself, of Navy officers,\nArmy officers, most of them with the exceptions of the OSS members, were in uniform. I\nwore a uniform but more for ornamental purposes. I was what they called a major at the\ntime, I believe. But they were a military tribunal after all. You saw the defense of course\nwas not in uniform and the bench wasn't except I believe the Russian judges were in\nuniform. Not the Americans, and not the French, certainly not the British.",
        "A: Not in preparation, but while I was in Nuremberg, I took time off to go to Dachau\nconcentration camp, which was only a few miles down from Nuremberg. I went there.\nWe had a guided tour by I think one of the former inmates. We went through the famous\ngate, \"Labor Makes You Free\" or something like it. We went there. They showed us\nsome of the ovens. In one of them I still detected some bones. They showed us the\ncourtyard where the prisoners were torn apart by dogs and they showed us the barracks.\nThat was after all a few months after the so-called liberation. That was an experience that\nno one can forget. I know that Eisenhower went there too at the time, well a few months\nearlier. Yes, I saw that, but I never saw the concentration camps in the east.",
        "A: Oh, many of them, yes. Some of them were friends who suddenly emerged in\nNuremberg. One was quite well known, Norbert Wllheim, who is one of the key figures\nnow in the Holocaust program. He was in Dachau. His son and his former wife were\ngassed. He survived and he went free, escaped, and got back to West Germany and is\nnow in the States and I see him infrequently. He lives in New York. I see many others\ntoo, and their stories are invariably the same. There are no six million lies, believe me.\nWell, that's more or less. I went eventually into the diplomatic service because I thought\nthe two things I wanted to do for in German affairs were punishment of the guilty and the\nresurrection of the democrats. I had done as much as I thought I could do and I went to\nDiplomatic Service and I was acting ambassador in Switzerland to and\neventually concluded my diplomatic career working for the environment. I was the first\nspecial assistant in the State Department for Environmental Affairs.",
        "A: Well, I have made all the comments I wanted to make. A manuscript which hasn't been\npublished yet in which I recounted for them my time from my childhood in Imperial\nGermany, in the Weimer Republic, in the Third Reich, to the war and the post war period\nand I believe that I don't claim any special credits for anything I've done but in a form,\nbut in a way at least in it's first part, my life was the life of a quintessential German Jew\nwho reaped all the benefits Germany had to offer in the early times and also witness and\nwas victimized by the horrific collapse of all values we cherish under Hitler. I've no\nregrets that I saw it. We were typical as I said in the beginning, German Jewish middle\nclass frapling, and not only we but going back to my grandparents. My grandfather on my\nmother's side was a who fought twice for his king against Denmark and\nAustria and was in fact imprisoned and returned, triumphantly, I suppose to his little\ntown in Rastrailia where he became the king of all marksman. He was a very good\nmarksman, and they had an annual fair there and he never failed to get the crown. He was\nas German and Jewish as they come. So was the whole family, all of them stuck to their\nloyalties and to their convictions throughout World War I and World War II and\nthereafter. All of them of that generation are now gone.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
