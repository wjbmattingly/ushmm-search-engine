        "Question: This is an interview for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. We are\ninterviewing Arlette de Long. My name is Ester Finder. Today\u2019s date is May 23, 1997.\nThis is Tape 1, Side A. Can you tell me what your name is?",
        "Answer: My name is Arlette de Long.",
        "Q: Could you spell that for me?",
        "A: A-R-L-E-T-T-E D-E L-O-N-G.",
        "Q: Was that your name at birth?",
        "A: No. At birth I was called -- my first name, Arlette, Waldmann, W-A-L-D-M-A-N-N.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: I was born June 15\", 1937.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Brocourt, France. It\u2019s in the department of Somme.",
        "Q: Could you spell those for me, please?",
        "A: Yes. B-R-O-C-O-U-R-T. Somme, S-O-M-M-E. It\u2019s in the north of France.",
        "Q: Did your family have a long history in France?",
        "A: No. My parents are not French. My mother came from Siberia -- she was born in\nSiberia, lived in China; came in France in 1918 or \u201920 to study medicine in Paris. My\nfather was born in Chernivtsi, which was Romania, used to be Austria and he spoke\nGerman as his first language. He came to Paris also to study medicine and they met in\nmedical school, and got married, and they came in the village, where I was born, in 1935.\nThey chose -- they chose that village because once they graduated from medical school,\nthey had no money between themselves at all. So, they searched for a place that would\nhave no physicians, and I don\u2019t know why it was in the north, exactly what was the\nprocess, but they found this village in which there were no doctors within about 30\nkilometers, or just -- or maybe less than that, 15. So, they rented a house, settled down,\nand never told anybody that they were Jews. It was 1935 and they must -- they -- they\nhad a good feeling for what was happening, they were really -- had much forethought, and\nin fact I think this is what saved our lives, because even though in the village I\u2019m sure\npeople knew we were Jewish, because we were this foreign family; Waldmann was the\nname, Waldmann (vald-man), however they spoke with an accent. My grandparents had\ncome from China to live with us in 1937. So, we suddenly were a very odd family in that\nvillage. There were no Jews at all anyplace in this area. But the fact that he was never\nofficially announced that -- when I was a child -- when I was born on -- I have papers. I\ndon\u2019t know if it happened in that (?sho-let-ry?) or not, but I have papers that I\u2019ve been\nbaptised. I think the only person who knew the truth was the priest in the village, who did\nnot speak. No one spoke. No -- no one told the Germans that we were Jews, or no one\nmade a concerted effort to get us out.",
        "Q: When you were growing up, did your parents speak to you about your family\nbackground and any traditions with respect to religion?",
        "A: No. Well, during the war certainly not, but I didn\u2019t really - no. I have no idea. I know\nvery little about my grandparents on my father\u2019s side. They died -- his father died during\nthe war, and his mother just a month after I was born, and my father never, never, never\nspoke about that. I asked a few questions, but I have no idea who they were, what their\nlife was like. My grandparents; I don\u2019t know if they were religious or not. My\ngrandfather died when I was eight and my grandmother died when I was here in America,\nI forget, 40, and she looked old. If there was a tradition, I don\u2019t know. What happened is\nwhen I was 10 I moved to the suburbs of Paris; my parents followed a year later. I spent a\nyear with my grandmother there. When my father came, he joined a synagogue in -- in\nthe town where we were, the suburbs of Paris, called Le Raincy, and it was -- of course in\nFrance we did not have reform, so it was a traditional synagogue with the woman going\nupstairs, and then we started going to that. I had no -- really no understanding much. I\nwasn\u2019t told very much about the religion, I don\u2019t think. Believing in God or not, I felt\nwas more sort of my business. It wasn\u2019t a family thing, and when I was 13-14 I stopped\nbelieving anyway, and for me it was more complicated, because I had gone to church\nwhen I was little in the village, and so....",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Do you have any memory of your life before the beginning of the war?",
        "A: None at all.",
        "Q: What were your first memories?",
        "A: My first memory was being under a table with my grandmother holding onto me, to\nmy shoulder. I wanted to get from under the table and she was very determined to keep\nme there. The reason was -- later on I was told that there were bombs. And now, this was\nnot in our village. At some time during the war, and I don\u2019t know when exactly, although\nI think I was pretty young. I must have been about two and a half years old, or three, my\nmother -- my father joined the army, the French army, as a volunteer. My mother and\ngrandparents left the village, we had a car, and we went down to (?cam-pare?), or\nsomeplace in Normandy. I\u2019m not absolutely sure what the purpose of the trip was. My\nfather later said that my grandparents want, and my mother wanted to leave France. Was\nit because -- was my mother trying to leave, you know, just go away? The story is\nunclear. The marriage was bad, so it might have been. Anyway, apparently my father\ndiscovered them. It\u2019s all very unbelievable. I don\u2019t know what the truth is. They will not\ntell me what the story is. But after a while we came back to our house in the village and\nmy father -- well, the army, the French army, surrendered very quickly. So -- but maybe\nit was -- I must have been -- it was -- must have been in the beginning of the war, because\nthere was no French army very soon after. So, this is my first memory. After that I don\u2019t\nhave any for a long time. I remembered the village, you know, my life in the village. I\nremember -- I remember really (?bar-is-son?).",
        "Q: After that episode that you just talked about, did you go back then to the village?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did your family make any effort to change their name? Or to, perhaps, conceal any\nsuggestion that they might be Jewish?",
        "A: No, because people already knew them by their name before the war. Since they\nhadn\u2019t said they were Jewish, they just kept on with the same pretense, so-to-speak.\nThere were no special -- there was no special effort that I can think of.",
        "Q: Do you remember the war years in this village? Did you -- was -- were you touched at\nall by the war?",
        "A: No. Well, yes and no. Of course, we were touched by -- the things I remember is the\nfood shortages, but they weren\u2019t real food shortages. There was no -- there was no\nchocolate, for instance, or very little sugar and my -- my parents best friend at the time,\nand my best friend too, owned a store, a grocery store, and I remember I used to go there\nevery day and looking at the chocolate that was displayed, and the candies and wanting\nsome, but everything was rationed, so I couldn\u2019t have them, and so, that was really\nmemory for me. There were no explanation, of course. I remember wooden shoes, shoes\nwith wooden soles that were heavy. I remember one time an American or British soldier\non a parachute came down, and I think he died, and the villagers got his parachute, which\nwas stained with blood, I think I saw it, but my mother had taken the - the thread of the\nparachute and had -- and knitted a jacket for me, sweater, which I absolutely hated, maybe\nbecause it had that connotations. Also, it was slippery, 1t was white, and I remember\nhating it. I don\u2019t ever remember wearing it, though. I must have.",
        "Q: Do you remember German soldiers in your town?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yeah. I used to play with them, with some of them. We had a big house.\nWe had -- relatively, for the village. We had a house with -- eventually indoor plumbing.\nI think we had it during the war already. But we had a brick house, and the -- we didn\u2019t\nhave a bathroom -- bathroom that I know. I mean, I used to take baths outside in a tub of\nwater, and the house was joined to -- to another house, there were two of them, and in the\nhouse next door to us there was an old, old lady who lived there with a -- who had a\nbeautiful garden full of flowers. The Germans took that house, took that part of the\nhouse, made her move, and we stayed in our part. We had a garden too, but not so many\nflowers, we had strawberries and potatoes and things. The two yards were contiguous so\nthat I used to -- the soldiers were there -- when they were in the yard, I used to go there\ntoo. I remember my mother saying not -- never to eat any of their candies, if they gave\nme some, because they could be poisoned. I don\u2019t know if I knew, but I knew -- I have a\nfeeling that I knew there was a secret. I don\u2019t think I knew we were Jews, especially. It\u2019s\nlike I had a feeling maybe they were bad, but I was too young to understand, really,\nwhether they were bad or not. It was confusing. The soldiers were not difficult towards -\n- | mean, they didn\u2019t harm the -- the population. They lived with us, they occupied the\nvillage, but to a child they looked like different people, but the people, they were not\nespecially frightened, I don\u2019t think.",
        "Q: Was there every any fighting in your village?",
        "A: No. We had a little bit of -- some men joined the R\u00e9sistance, I think, but it was more a\ngesture, I think. When -- we didn\u2019t have bombs. Bombs didn\u2019t fall on us. They fall --\nfell on the village not too far from us. Because they had V8s, they had bunkers, the\nGermans, and they were sending the V8 to Germany from that place. So, they could\nbomb quite a bit, but not us. There were about 10 kilometers away from our house.",
        "Q: Did your parents seem at all uncomfortable, or nervous, when the Germans were near\nthem?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I -- my parents were very anxious. Yeah. My father spoke German. You\nknow, this was his mother tongue. So, I think that that was very useful. I think he treated\nthe German soldiers as well as the French people, and that was helpful for us.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak in your home?",
        "A: We spoke two languages. I spoke Russian with my grandfather and grandmother and\nmy mother, and French with my father and my mother too.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what a Jew was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Had there been any discussion about Jews, to the best of your recollection?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: In those....",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did your parents have any discussions that you might have been present for, or you\nmight have overheard, about what was happening in other parts of Europe?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t think I had any knowledge of concentration camps or any -- any\nsuch thing at all. I knew the Germans were bad. There was killing and bombs. There\nwas danger and I knew there was something very bad and that the Germans -- we were\nhoping would leave. That\u2019s about as far as it got.",
        "Q: Did you get a sense from the people in the village that they knew something of your\nfamily secret, or they were protective of you in any way?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- no, not at all. I thought -- we had a privileged position, being the\ndoctor. My father was respected. He was a good doctor. He is, yeah. He was well liked.\nHe was quite devoted to his people. He used to go by car, by -- first by bicycle, then my\nmotorcycle, and then by car, all around when people were sick. If people didn\u2019t have\nmoney he treated them for free. We always had food because the farmers would give us\nthings to eat. So, I felt really a little special being his daughter, but not in any different\nway than that when I was a child. I didn\u2019t know any differently -- I was never confronted\nby (?._?) or I didn\u2019t suffer in any way for being a Jew.",
        "Q: When you look back to those years during the war, are there any episodes, or any\nmemories, that stand out in your mind?",
        "A: Yes. That was at the end of the war; I was -- must have been eight and it was in the\nspring, or in the summer; it was early in the morning and my -- oh, by that time we had\nmoved. The German had to -- Germans took our house. So, they made us move, and we\nmoved in the village next door to us, but they were detached to each other. So, it was\nreally like (?___?) village with an old lady, and it was very early, my grandmother, she\ncame in the room, shook me, and said, \u201cWake up, wake up, we\u2019ve got to run.\u201d So, we ran\noutside and hid in the chicken coup. What had happened is -- and my mother was inside\nthe house and my father and grandfather were running away towards the (?__\u2014??)..~ The\nGermans had come to everybody, but we didn\u2019t know that at first, and they made us go in\nfront of the (? Merie ?), they separated the townhouse, they separated the men, the women\nand the children, they brought trucks and they were going to ship us to Germany because\nsomething had happened, I\u2019m not sure what. The food had been stolen, or someone had\nbeen killed, but it was really frightening. They shot towards my grandmother and me, but\ndidn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- missed us. But it was pretty scary. And I remember so standing in the\ngarden for a minute, and the old lady who was with us in her nightgown. Then I\nremembered spending some time with the other children and our teacher. I remember\nseeing Francois, the woman who had the grocery store, she was very pregnant at the time\nand she was crying. I also remember crying, but I didn\u2019t know why I was crying, but I\nsaw all the kids crying, so I figured -- I mean, I knew I was feeling bad, but I wasn\u2019t sure\nwhy -- what the danger was. So, that was a significant memory. I remember that. But\nagain, it was not because we were Jews, it was because we were in the village.",
        "Q: What happened to the people that the Germans had collected?",
        "A: Oh, they collected all of us. The priest talked them out of taking us to Germany. We\nwere lucky.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your early days in school during the war?",
        "A: My first school -- I don\u2019t remember very well, whether I was four or five, five maybe,\nwhen I went. It was a Catholic school. The teacher made us sing songs about Vive\nP\u00e9tain, which my parents must have loved when I\u2019d come home. I had no idea who\nP\u00e9tain was, or whatever it was. I remember we had a garden, we were planting a garden,\nworking in the garden on the slope next to the church and I remember loving that. It was\nfun.",
        "Q: Tell me about this song.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know any more than Vive P\u00e9tain was part of the song. After that I went -- and\nthat might have been after the war, I don\u2019t know the changes at all. I went to one school,\none room school, in the village and there were kids from the age of seven -- I might have\nbeen -- I might have been there. From the age of -- before the war ended. From seven to\nfourteen we were all together with one teacher, and I remember the teacher screaming at\nus because you can imagine boys and girls, everybody in one room, and I used to talk a\nlot. I would talk and talk and talk. So, they -- she had me sit alone under her nose, which\nI did not like.",
        "Q: What kinds of things did you study? Was there anything that you studied during the\nwar that you might not have studied if there hadn\u2019t been a war?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I just studied how to read and write and add. It was really simple. I\nmean, I was very much behind. When I moved to (?__??) it took me a year to catch up,\nbecause I barely -- I knew some things, but very much less than other kids did. It\u2019s hard\nto know how the war affected us, because by the time I have any memory at all, you\nknow, that was all I knew.",
        "Q: Did you have any regular contact with the German soldiers?",
        "A: (2?)",
        "Q: Except to run into them in the garden?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: Were there any -- to the best of your recollections, were there any restrictions or rules\nimposed by the Germans on the villagers?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think we had to blackout the windows, we did that ourselves. I\ndon\u2019t -- I have a very, very vague memory, that may have been an early memory of -- we\nhad a trench in the garden and going in there, seems like in the evening, or at night, when\n-- when there were airplanes above us. The airplanes were scary because you never knew\nwhat they were going to do, where the bombs would fall. They never fell on us, but it\nwas -- I think they were -- you know, the food restrictions, which I remember the most. I\nthink -- I was told, I didn\u2019t know that, but I was told you couldn\u2019t butcher animals. Gas,\ngasoline was restricted.",
        "Q: Were your movements restricted in any way? Travel or....",
        "A: Not that I knew, no.",
        "Q: When you were in school and you said that you attended church, when you were in\nchurch...",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: ...was any mention ever made of Jews and Judaism? In any way shape or form that\nyou can recall?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember anything about Jews. I remember being -- the priest talking\nabout Jesus and me developing a great love for -- for a man who was described as loving\nchildren, and I think for me the connection was, my family was not very loving and it was\nnice to have an idea that someplace there was somebody who was looking after you. So,\nthat\u2019s what I remember about the church. It was -- it was a good place. I liked it.",
        "Q: Did your parents attend church along with you?",
        "A: No, no. My parents did not, and I think they were very -- my mother is, I remember,\nwas very unhappy if I -- I always wanted to cross myself and I don\u2019t know if -- when I\nwas a kid if I could do it or not, but afterwards, it was forbidden. It was like a very bad\nthing, and yet, it\u2019s funny, even to this day, when something really bad happens, you\nknow, the impulse is still there on me to do it.",
        "Q: Was it unusual for adults to miss church attendance? Did -- was anybody -- so, your --\nyou\u2019re shaking your head, you need to give me an answer.",
        "A: Sure. Yeah. No, it wouldn\u2019t have been -- especially the men, they didn\u2019t necessarily\ngo that much. It was the family we were friendly with, Francois and her husband, Marcel.\nFor instance, Marcel was a communist. I don\u2019t know if he was a communist at that time,\nor if it existed, but he was fiercely anti-religion. Oh, he hated the priest. He hated the\nidea of -- it\u2019s funny, he still is. His wife, of course, was Catholic. Everybody was\nCatholic in the village. You know, everybody had been baptised. And -- you know, I\ndon\u2019t think she went much to church, either. I mean, you were Catholic because that was\npart of your -- of your way of living, everyone was baptised, it was normal. But you\ndidn\u2019t have to practice. So, that not very many people would go to church. But they\nwould go in the priest if they were sick. I mean, you took no chances, and baptisms were\nobligated, communion, first communion.",
        "Q: Did you participate in any of the Catholic rituals, other than going to church, was there\nanything above -- above that level of observance that you engaged in?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- well, I would have been too young for first communion, and I don\u2019t think\nthere is more children take communion.",
        "Q: Were there any church events, or anything like that? Maybe I should have made the\nquestion more clear.",
        "A: I very faintly think there was a ceremony, something with flowers, and I don\u2019t know if\nI went or not.",
        "Q: Did your family observe Christmas in your house?",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t observe -- observe many holidays, no Jewish holidays, in those days.\nNot Christmas\u2019s. I may have gotten a book, or something like that. May have gotten a\npresent, but no.",
        "Q: And not Easter?",
        "A: No. No, Easter was not part of the (?___?).",
        "Q: When you look back on those days, do you have a sense that people really knew you\nwere Jewish, or do you have a sense now as an adult, looking back...",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: ...do you have a sense that maybe they weren\u2019t sure?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were sure in the sense that they had proof, or they had seen any signs\nof being Jewish, or like Yamika, or any of the traditional signs. Of course, there were no\nsynagogues in the village, you would have to go 40 kilometers to the town. So, they\ndidn\u2019t have solid proof. On the other hand, I think the name is a Jewish name by itself,\nWaldmann, apparently, Waldmann (vald-man), my parents were -- they had dark hair and\n-- everybody in the family looks more Jewish than I do. I\u2019m the only one with this lighter\nhair and blue eyes, and so, I think everybody suspected. I think it was pretty common\nsuspicion or knowledge. Yeah.",
        "Q: Was your -- to your knowledge, again, was there any incentive for the town\u2019s people,\nor the villagers, to pursue this, or to turn you in as a suspected Jew? Was there any\nmotivation, or incentive, for this kind of act?",
        "A: Yes and no. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s an interesting story. For -- for most of the people I don\u2019t think\nthere was any incentive, because my father was the doctor and he helped everybody and\nhe was well liked. So, there was no reason to kill the village doctor and then be left\nwithout anybody. On a personal level, it was interesting and more complicated, because\nmuch later on, about 10 years ago, I was -- at first I had believed, that\u2019s what my mother\nhad told me that no one knew in the village. It was a very well-kept secret and that\u2019s why\nwe never had any troubles. I spoke with a man whose -- whose wife was my father\u2019s\nmistress, and this was common knowledge in the village, everybody knew, and he\ncertainly would have had incentive to get rid of him, and he didn\u2019t. He -- he was the one\nwho told me when I mentioned that nobody knew we were Jews in the village, he started\nto laugh and said, \u201cEverybody knew, but we were not animals.\u201d So -- so, we were saved\nby the grace, in a way, of this man, and of the whole village. Certainly they could have\ngotten rid of us.",
        "Q: Did the man say any more to you in your conversation 10 years ago?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s interesting, because we -- we have all -- we are all friendly still.\nBut it is also a taboo subject. The relationship between my father and Francois -- when I\nspeak to Francois, which I do quite often from here, I call her. We have never, never\nmentioned -- she calls my father Dr. Valmon (ph), because they have changed their name\nsince, and it\u2019s all really kind of funny, but I feel that she wants her privacy and it\u2019s not to\nme -- for me to -- to invade it, although I am very curious and I would like to ask\nquestions about their relationship, and whatever happened back then. But (? _?).",
        "Q: There must have been many other events that occurred during the war years, in your\nlife. Can you reconstruct some of what your life was like during those years?",
        "A: [have very few memories of my childhood. The war years in -- in a way, well it\u2019s a\nparadox, but when I was 10 and I moved to live in the suburbs of Paris, this was to me a\nmuch more painful event than any of the war years. I liked living in the village. I was\nhappy there despite the war, and despite the difficulties, it was a better time in my life,\nand so, the -- the loss at the same time when I was eight, after the war ended my\ngrandfather died and that was a tremendous loss to me, and -- and I have very, very few\nmemories of -- maybe the two years before he died and none -- none at all between eight -\n- eight and ten and a half. I have absolute no memories at all. It\u2019s all erased. But I have\none memory at the end of the war, I remember, it was -- we were standing in front of my\nhouse with my family, I think, and two tanks came with either American or Canadian\nsoldiers, and the Germans stood in between the soldiers, in between the tanks, and they\nthrew their hands up in the air and their weapons fell down, and the soldiers threw us\ngum, which we\u2019ve never seen, like, you kept that piece of gum and chewed on it, I think,\nfor two weeks. At night I would put it away. And that was it. That was the end of the\nwar, and then the woman next -- across the street from us, she was a spinster. Apparently,\nshe had been sleeping with a soldier -- with some soldiers, which -- it makes me laugh,\nbecause when I was a child I thought of her as so ancient. You know, it was like a 90-\nyear-old woman; maybe she was 30 or 40, who knows, but she felt very injured, and so, it\nwas -- it was kind of comical to think of her sleeping with everybody. She got her head\nshaved.",
        "Q: Which soldiers was she -- German or...",
        "A: German. We only had Germans.",
        "Q: Not -- not the liberating soldiers.",
        "A: Oh hell, no. They wouldn\u2019t have -- nobody in France would shave your head for\nsleeping with a man, but soldiers, you know, German soldiers.",
        "Q: We have to pause to change tapes.\n... TAPE CHANGE.",
        "Question: This is Tape 1, side B. We are interviewing Arlette de Long. And you were\ntelling me about the woman who had her head shaved...",
        "Answer: Yes.",
        "Q: ...for having slept with German...",
        "A: Soldiers.",
        "Q: ...with German soldiers...",
        "A: Or soldiers.",
        "Q: ...or a German soldier.",
        "A: A German soldier. I didn\u2019t know anything about it, of course, until, you know, after\nthe war. Her name was Mademoiselle Levon (ph) and it -- I don\u2019t know. You know,\nthings were done, I think, people got self-righteous in the village afterwards, but I really\ndon\u2019t know much about it. Unfortunately after that, I have no memories. That\u2019s my last\nmemory.",

        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: ...to the suburbs of Paris.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: Why did your family move?",
        "A: Ostensibly the reason was because I needed a better education. The truth was that\nAmiens, which was a big town 40 kilometers away, could have provided a perfectly good\neducation for me as a boarder and I could home on the weekends, but my mother wanted\nto move. She wanted out of there, which was understandable. My father did not, but\neventually he gave in, and so, we moved.",
        "Q: And you also mentioned earlier that it was 1n -- in this new home that your father\njoined a synagogue.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: Can you tell me your first memories of your introduction to Judaism?",
        "A: Yes. Unfortunately, they were very, very negative. Even though I was, you know, 11\nat least, I don\u2019t think my parents had explained to me any -- any of what was -- what had\nhappened. And also, because at the same time I was going to the Girl Scouts and the Girl\nScouts were Protestant, the troop, and so, I was -- I went back to church, but this time to\nthe Protestant temple, which again, I liked, because at least they spoke English -- or\nFrench. You know, I could understand some of it. But I remember -- and I have it to this\nday, I am ashamed of the feeling, but I can\u2019t help it, sort of visceral dislike for the way the\npeople looked, the Jews looked, because I did not know that those were the survivors.\nYou know? So, they looked battered and they looked sad and they looked grey, you\nknow? I didn\u2019t know any of that, and so, they looked awful to me, you know, those\npeople compared to the Catholic who were young and, you know, in good health and\ncertainly didn\u2019t have the past. So, I wished I -- I wanted to be like all the other girls. I\nwanted to go to church, you know, legitimately. I wanted to take communion, I wanted to\ncontinue believing in Christ and -- you know, and then -- by then it was a terrible thing,\nand I was required to hate -- hate the Christians, but I had no whelm of hatred in me for\nChristians.",
        "Q: Why were you required to hate the Christians?",
        "A: That was my mother\u2019s call for allegiance, so-to-speak. If I loved her, you know, I was\nto love her and hate -- love the Jews, hate the Christians, but you can\u2019t make yourself. So,\nwhat happened was the opposite mostly, and the synagogue was terribly boring. I had to\nsit upstairs. I\u2019m an only child, so I didn\u2019t have any siblings to commiserate with. I was\nsitting there with my mother, who didn\u2019t believe in anything, and was, you know, just\nsitting there and I think she was talking with other women. The rituals didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I missed the church ritual and the respect when you go in the church; you\u2019re quiet,\nyou pray. There, it was just sort of sitting up there watching men in dark suits downstairs.\nThe rabbi, who was mean and ugly. His wife, who was -- her hair was -- head was\nshaved, she was wearing a wig and the wig didn\u2019t fit, and I was just there and I hated it,\nbut I hated it guiltily because I was expected not to, and it meant no -- I didn\u2019t believe in\nGod by then. I felt it didn\u2019t make sense to me. And so, I just put in time because I had to.",
        "Q: When did you learn about what happened to the Jewish people in other parts of\nEurope?",
        "A: You know, I really stayed away from knowledge. I didn\u2019t want to learn, I didn\u2019t want\nto know, I didn\u2019t want to be part of it; I married a Methodist, who was not practicing. It\u2019s\nnot that I -- I hid that I was Jewish. I always said I was Jewish, because I feel you\u2019re born\nthis way, you can\u2019t erase it. But I never identified with the Jews. I thought it was more of\na curse to be born a Jew. And so, I really didn\u2019t want to know, and interestingly it\u2019s my\ndaughter, when she was 16, she started asking me questions about the Holocaust and I\nsaid to her, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t know much and you surely don\u2019t need to know, it\u2019s too\nhorrible, forget it.\u201d But she needed to know. She started to read. I started having\nnightmares, and so, I needed to help her. So, I - I started myself to read a little bit and\nbecome, you know, more knowledgeable, so I could talk to her. And it was -- she is now\n29, so it was a slow -- a very slow progression. I still, you know, haven\u2019t seen (?Schorr?)\nor I haven\u2019t seen that new movie, Schindler\u2019s List, because I am very visual and if I see\nsomething like that it\u2019s going to haunt me for months and months and months, if not\nyears. And I figured, I went to the Holocaust Museum and I went through it in a daze, I\ndon\u2019t remember much, except for the shoes and the car -- the wagon. It\u2019s about all I\nremember -- oh no, the picture, the tower of pictures.",
        "Q: After the war, did your parents make any efforts to find some of the people, relatives,\nfriends, that they grew up with before they came to France?",
        "A: No. My mother is an only child. But my grandmother was one of 12, I think. So,\nthere must have been a lot of people in Russia, but they never made any attempt -- any\neffort at knowing the family, or I wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know their name or anything. My\nfather was one of four. I have an uncle who lives in Munich, who I think may have been\nin a camp and came out. I met him once. Then -- and then the rest of the family, I don\u2019t\nknow. I didn\u2019t even know their names. So my parents, we -- we really, really cut\nthemselves off entirely from family (? _?).",
        "Q: Did you ever experience any anti-Semitism in France?",
        "A: No, except for an occasional remark. People don\u2019t think of me -- people who don\u2019t\nknow, don\u2019t think of me as Jewish. I think it\u2019s because Arlette is such an unJewish name,\nor when I was growing up. Personally, no. I can\u2019t remember having been directly\nattacked. The funny thing that happened -- the funniest thing that happened to me was in\nAmerica, and it was a funny story, because I was driving in a car with a woman who was\na social worker and also a nun, and her friend, and the nun did not know I was Jewish and\nas we\u2019re driving, some -- some car cuts her off and she says, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a Jew. They are\nso pushy.\u201d At which point I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t let you get away with that.\u201d So, I said, \u201cI\nam a Jew\u2019, and she was so embarrassed. It was funny, but it was also pretty innocent, I\nfelt. And so, once in a while I hear remarks like that. Some -- some woman who told me\nabout somebody trying to \u201cJew\u201d her. But I very often -- I didn\u2019t -- I knew the woman\nvery slightly, and I -- I don\u2019t pick up on those things, because I don\u2019t -- I feel they\u2019re too\nstupid, you know, I\u2019m not going to give them -- honour them with a response. So, I\u2019ve\nbeen quite lucky, in retrospect.",
        "Q: When did you come to the United States?",
        "A: I came in 1962, and I originally came for a vacation, three weeks\u2019 vacation, then I\ndecided to spend a year to learn the language and also to get away, and then I met my ex-\nhusband at Stanford and within six weeks we were married. We stayed married 10 years,\nand have two children, and once I had the children I could not see taking them to France\nand cutting them -- basically it would have been cutting them off from their father, which\nI did not want to do to them. I\u2019d been enough -- through enough separations that I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to impose that on them. So, I stayed. I stayed in this country.",
        "Q: When you say you had been through enough separations that you didn\u2019t want to\nimpose that on them; what are you referring to?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m just thinking, you know, about my grandfather and leaving the village, you\nknow, those kinds of disruptions as a child. When you\u2019re a child what you need are roots.\nA divorce is bad enough, but you don\u2019t want any deceptions, you don\u2019t want any changes.\nSo, that\u2019s why I stayed here.",
        "Q: Did your parents stay married?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Mm hm.",
        "Q: When you look back to your childhood during the war...",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: ...are there any other memories, or feelings, that you have, or anything else that might\ncome to mind at this point that you want to add?",
        "A: I think, for me, the war might have been like thunder in the background. You know\nwhen you hear thunder at the distance and in a way you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to\ncome closer or move away. So, there is some sense of danger. Like, there are planes in\nthe night. Years later when -- I don\u2019t even know. Oh no, there was one thing I never\nunderstood exactly why I felt that way, it was listening to machine gun fire, or any kind of\ngun shooting. I don\u2019t know if it was from that one experience, or what, but that would\nabsolutely make me shake, and that surprised me, because, you know, I was not really\npart of any very traumatic events that I can think of, but that -- that - I would have a\ntremendous response to that. I just couldn\u2019t stand it. Now, it\u2019s getting better, but in\nmovies I\u2019m careful, because it could send me -- it used to. I mean, I saw a movie and I\nshook for a good hour and cried. So, there was a sense of danger, I think, which I may\nhave repressed or not want to deal with, because there was some other aspects of my\nchildhood that were good. I certainly wish it never had happened. I mean, not only for\nall the others, of course, but personally that -- I don\u2019t know it was damaging in some ways\nthat I don\u2019t know. I think it was the atmosphere that was poisonous, but poisonous in a\nway that does a child to just absorb, but do not understand.",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t perceive any lasting fallout from your Holocaust -- your\nexperiences during the war too?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I think so. Well, I think 1t was either thinking back on it, of course. I think\nfor me the most difficult thing was being a Jew, because the experience was so mixed and\nso poorly integrated, and my sense of identity has been being -- being part of a group I\nnever wanted to be part of, but that I could not leave, nor would I want to leave for sense\nof guilt. I do have a sense of guilt, that\u2019s one of the reasons I didn\u2019t really want to tell the\nstory because I feel, what do I have to tell, you know, so many people have suffered so\nterribly, as I know from the group here and children survivors. You know, I didn\u2019t suffer,\nor -- why not? There 1s this -- this survivor\u2019s guilt. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s a real thing, and it\ncertainly had a profound effect. A sense of insecurity. You know, you never know when\nyou could be asked to move, or asked to leave. You never know if a bomb will fall on\nyour head. But I think it was both, it was the war in general, which all the children,\neverybody in my time suffered from, and it was personal in the difficulty of being a Jew\nand having such strong identification with -- with a man, with Christ, with a religion\nwhich basically also doesn\u2019t exist very much; it\u2019s an idea in my head. The Catholic\nChurch, I wouldn\u2019t be part of it if you paid me at this time, because there are many things\nI think they are doing which are not (? _?), because they didn\u2019t fight the Germans either\nvery much. So, it\u2019s a place that\u2019s sort of -- it\u2019s sort of no-man\u2019s-land, you know? And\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add before we conclude the interview today? I did\nwant to ask you a little bit about your -- your life in this country and your professional\ncareer. Would you mind sharing just a few minutes with me on that?",
        "A: No. I think my career -- I have -- I was lucky to -- to have found -- to have found a\ncareer that really met a lot -- a lot of needs for me, and in which I have a sense of my life.\nHaving made a little difference, I worked with adults most of my life as a psychotherapist.\nI\u2019m now going to work with children, which I look forward to. I think I have a sense of --\na sense, a need, a wish, of -- to help those who are less fortunate. The greatest pain I have\n-- it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s interesting because it has nothing to do with the war, or maybe it does, is\nof being in exile. I did not really wanted to leave France. I left mostly to escape my\nparents, not the Germans. I can\u2019t go back. I\u2019d go back, but I cannot go back because my\nchildren are here, my life is here, and all I know, I think, I survived much better than other\npeople. I was lucky. And well, you know, like many in New York, Jews are not Jews,\nwe all pay the price for the time we were born.",
        "Q: Are your parents still alive?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: Could you tell me their names?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name is Joseph Valmon (ph). In 1955, \u00b053, I don\u2019t know, something like\nthat, he changed his name from Waldmann to Valmon (ph) when he became a French\ncitizen. And my mother\u2019s name is Fanni Valmon (ph), and (?__?) was her maiden name.",
        "Q: One final question.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: You mentioned several times that your father was the town physician.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: But you also mentioned that your mother went to medical school and that\u2019s where they\nmet.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: Did your mother also practice medicine?",
        "A: My mother practiced medicine, but only in the house. She never -- she was -- stayed\nin an auxiliary role. She never went to see patients outside, but patients came to the house\nand she practiced that way. She was not a very (? _?) practitioner. She preferred not to.\nBut she -- she did help my father. He was really the main one, person, in terms of work.",
        "Q: Thank you, and this concludes our interview today.\n... TAPE ENDS.",
        "Question: We\u2019re going to add a postscript. There was something else that you wanted to\nadd, and I\u2019ll give you the opportunity to -- to make a final comment.",
        "Answer: Okay. One of the reasons I wanted to tell my story and this was very strong for\nme when I first started thinking about it, was it is a story of hope and it is also a story that\ncounteracts so many of the -- of the stories of people who had been turned in by the\nFrench, who had been persecuted, who had been betrayed. In my case -- and it feels for\nno reason in a way, it was just pure kindness, or pure decency, on the part of the people.\nThey were just -- they were not killers. That\u2019s what the man said, \u201cWe are not animals.\u201d\nMaybe (? _?) human nature is -- is very much that too. That despite the other side of\nthe story, that there is a lot of compassion and I want to say thank you to the people who\nsaved us, and also say that perhaps there were other stories like mine, but I\u2019m not\nregarded because people may not think about telling them, or being in the position to tell\nthem. That I was not -- we were not alone, my family was not alone in having been\nhelped. As a matter of fact, there was a whole village in -- in the (?_?) in which the\npriest led all the people, to save the Jews, and so, those are the stories that I want people\nto know about.

        "A: Yes. B-R-O-C-O-U-R-T. Somme, S-O-M-M-E. It\u2019s in the north of France.",
        "A: No. My parents are not French. My mother came from Siberia -- she was born in\nSiberia, lived in China; came in France in 1918 or \u201920 to study medicine in Paris. My\nfather was born in Chernivtsi, which was Romania, used to be Austria and he spoke\nGerman as his first language. He came to Paris also to study medicine and they met in\nmedical school, and got married, and they came in the village, where I was born, in 1935.\nThey chose -- they chose that village because once they graduated from medical school,\nthey had no money between themselves at all. So, they searched for a place that would\nhave no physicians, and I don\u2019t know why it was in the north, exactly what was the\nprocess, but they found this village in which there were no doctors within about 30\nkilometers, or just -- or maybe less than that, 15. So, they rented a house, settled down,\nand never told anybody that they were Jews. It was 1935 and they must -- they -- they\nhad a good feeling for what was happening, they were really -- had much forethought, and\nin fact I think this is what saved our lives, because even though in the village I\u2019m sure\npeople knew we were Jewish, because we were this foreign family; Waldmann was the\nname, Waldmann (vald-man), however they spoke with an accent. My grandparents had\ncome from China to live with us in 1937. So, we suddenly were a very odd family in that\nvillage. There were no Jews at all anyplace in this area. But the fact that he was never\nofficially announced that -- when I was a child -- when I was born on -- I have papers. I\ndon\u2019t know if it happened in that (?sho-let-ry?) or not, but I have papers that I\u2019ve been\nbaptised. I think the only person who knew the truth was the priest in the village, who did\nnot speak. No one spoke. No -- no one told the Germans that we were Jews, or no one\nmade a concerted effort to get us out.",
        "A: No. Well, during the war certainly not, but I didn\u2019t really - no. I have no idea. I know\nvery little about my grandparents on my father\u2019s side. They died -- his father died during\nthe war, and his mother just a month after I was born, and my father never, never, never\nspoke about that. I asked a few questions, but I have no idea who they were, what their\nlife was like. My grandparents; I don\u2019t know if they were religious or not. My\ngrandfather died when I was eight and my grandmother died when I was here in America,\nI forget, 40, and she looked old. If there was a tradition, I don\u2019t know. What happened is\nwhen I was 10 I moved to the suburbs of Paris; my parents followed a year later. I spent a\nyear with my grandmother there. When my father came, he joined a synagogue in -- in\nthe town where we were, the suburbs of Paris, called Le Raincy, and it was -- of course in\nFrance we did not have reform, so it was a traditional synagogue with the woman going\nupstairs, and then we started going to that. I had no -- really no understanding much. I\nwasn\u2019t told very much about the religion, I don\u2019t think. Believing in God or not, I felt\nwas more sort of my business. It wasn\u2019t a family thing, and when I was 13-14 I stopped\nbelieving anyway, and for me it was more complicated, because I had gone to church\nwhen I was little in the village, and so....",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: None at all.",
        "A: My first memory was being under a table with my grandmother holding onto me, to\nmy shoulder. I wanted to get from under the table and she was very determined to keep\nme there. The reason was -- later on I was told that there were bombs. And now, this was\nnot in our village. At some time during the war, and I don\u2019t know when exactly, although\nI think I was pretty young. I must have been about two and a half years old, or three, my\nmother -- my father joined the army, the French army, as a volunteer. My mother and\ngrandparents left the village, we had a car, and we went down to (?cam-pare?), or\nsomeplace in Normandy. I\u2019m not absolutely sure what the purpose of the trip was. My\nfather later said that my grandparents want, and my mother wanted to leave France. Was\nit because -- was my mother trying to leave, you know, just go away? The story is\nunclear. The marriage was bad, so it might have been. Anyway, apparently my father\ndiscovered them. It\u2019s all very unbelievable. I don\u2019t know what the truth is. They will not\ntell me what the story is. But after a while we came back to our house in the village and\nmy father -- well, the army, the French army, surrendered very quickly. So -- but maybe\nit was -- I must have been -- it was -- must have been in the beginning of the war, because\nthere was no French army very soon after. So, this is my first memory. After that I don\u2019t\nhave any for a long time. I remembered the village, you know, my life in the village. I\nremember -- I remember really (?bar-is-son?).",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, because people already knew them by their name before the war. Since they\nhadn\u2019t said they were Jewish, they just kept on with the same pretense, so-to-speak.\nThere were no special -- there was no special effort that I can think of.",
        "A: No. Well, yes and no. Of course, we were touched by -- the things I remember is the\nfood shortages, but they weren\u2019t real food shortages. There was no -- there was no\nchocolate, for instance, or very little sugar and my -- my parents best friend at the time,\nand my best friend too, owned a store, a grocery store, and I remember I used to go there\nevery day and looking at the chocolate that was displayed, and the candies and wanting\nsome, but everything was rationed, so I couldn\u2019t have them, and so, that was really\nmemory for me. There were no explanation, of course. I remember wooden shoes, shoes\nwith wooden soles that were heavy. I remember one time an American or British soldier\non a parachute came down, and I think he died, and the villagers got his parachute, which\nwas stained with blood, I think I saw it, but my mother had taken the - the thread of the\nparachute and had -- and knitted a jacket for me, sweater, which I absolutely hated, maybe\nbecause it had that connotations. Also, it was slippery, 1t was white, and I remember\nhating it. I don\u2019t ever remember wearing it, though. I must have.",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yeah. I used to play with them, with some of them. We had a big house.\nWe had -- relatively, for the village. We had a house with -- eventually indoor plumbing.\nI think we had it during the war already. But we had a brick house, and the -- we didn\u2019t\nhave a bathroom -- bathroom that I know. I mean, I used to take baths outside in a tub of\nwater, and the house was joined to -- to another house, there were two of them, and in the\nhouse next door to us there was an old, old lady who lived there with a -- who had a\nbeautiful garden full of flowers. The Germans took that house, took that part of the\nhouse, made her move, and we stayed in our part. We had a garden too, but not so many\nflowers, we had strawberries and potatoes and things. The two yards were contiguous so\nthat I used to -- the soldiers were there -- when they were in the yard, I used to go there\ntoo. I remember my mother saying not -- never to eat any of their candies, if they gave\nme some, because they could be poisoned. I don\u2019t know if I knew, but I knew -- I have a\nfeeling that I knew there was a secret. I don\u2019t think I knew we were Jews, especially. It\u2019s\nlike I had a feeling maybe they were bad, but I was too young to understand, really,\nwhether they were bad or not. It was confusing. The soldiers were not difficult towards -\n- | mean, they didn\u2019t harm the -- the population. They lived with us, they occupied the\nvillage, but to a child they looked like different people, but the people, they were not\nespecially frightened, I don\u2019t think.",
        "A: No. We had a little bit of -- some men joined the R\u00e9sistance, I think, but it was more a\ngesture, I think. When -- we didn\u2019t have bombs. Bombs didn\u2019t fall on us. They fall --\nfell on the village not too far from us. Because they had V8s, they had bunkers, the\nGermans, and they were sending the V8 to Germany from that place. So, they could\nbomb quite a bit, but not us. There were about 10 kilometers away from our house.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I -- my parents were very anxious. Yeah. My father spoke German. You\nknow, this was his mother tongue. So, I think that that was very useful. I think he treated\nthe German soldiers as well as the French people, and that was helpful for us.",
        "A: We spoke two languages. I spoke Russian with my grandfather and grandmother and\nmy mother, and French with my father and my mother too.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t think I had any knowledge of concentration camps or any -- any\nsuch thing at all. I knew the Germans were bad. There was killing and bombs. There\nwas danger and I knew there was something very bad and that the Germans -- we were\nhoping would leave. That\u2019s about as far as it got.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t -- no, not at all. I thought -- we had a privileged position, being the\ndoctor. My father was respected. He was a good doctor. He is, yeah. He was well liked.\nHe was quite devoted to his people. He used to go by car, by -- first by bicycle, then my\nmotorcycle, and then by car, all around when people were sick. If people didn\u2019t have\nmoney he treated them for free. We always had food because the farmers would give us\nthings to eat. So, I felt really a little special being his daughter, but not in any different\nway than that when I was a child. I didn\u2019t know any differently -- I was never confronted\nby (?._?) or I didn\u2019t suffer in any way for being a Jew.",
        "A: Yes. That was at the end of the war; I was -- must have been eight and it was in the\nspring, or in the summer; it was early in the morning and my -- oh, by that time we had\nmoved. The German had to -- Germans took our house. So, they made us move, and we\nmoved in the village next door to us, but they were detached to each other. So, it was\nreally like (?___?) village with an old lady, and it was very early, my grandmother, she\ncame in the room, shook me, and said, \u201cWake up, wake up, we\u2019ve got to run.\u201d So, we ran\noutside and hid in the chicken coup. What had happened is -- and my mother was inside\nthe house and my father and grandfather were running away towards the (?__\u2014??)..~ The\nGermans had come to everybody, but we didn\u2019t know that at first, and they made us go in\nfront of the (? Merie ?), they separated the townhouse, they separated the men, the women\nand the children, they brought trucks and they were going to ship us to Germany because\nsomething had happened, I\u2019m not sure what. The food had been stolen, or someone had\nbeen killed, but it was really frightening. They shot towards my grandmother and me, but\ndidn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- missed us. But it was pretty scary. And I remember so standing in the\ngarden for a minute, and the old lady who was with us in her nightgown. Then I\nremembered spending some time with the other children and our teacher. I remember\nseeing Francois, the woman who had the grocery store, she was very pregnant at the time\nand she was crying. I also remember crying, but I didn\u2019t know why I was crying, but I\nsaw all the kids crying, so I figured -- I mean, I knew I was feeling bad, but I wasn\u2019t sure\nwhy -- what the danger was. So, that was a significant memory. I remember that. But\nagain, it was not because we were Jews, it was because we were in the village.",
        "A: Oh, they collected all of us. The priest talked them out of taking us to Germany. We\nwere lucky.",
        "A: My first school -- I don\u2019t remember very well, whether I was four or five, five maybe,\nwhen I went. It was a Catholic school. The teacher made us sing songs about Vive\nP\u00e9tain, which my parents must have loved when I\u2019d come home. I had no idea who\nP\u00e9tain was, or whatever it was. I remember we had a garden, we were planting a garden,\nworking in the garden on the slope next to the church and I remember loving that. It was\nfun.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know any more than Vive P\u00e9tain was part of the song. After that I went -- and\nthat might have been after the war, I don\u2019t know the changes at all. I went to one school,\none room school, in the village and there were kids from the age of seven -- I might have\nbeen -- I might have been there. From the age of -- before the war ended. From seven to\nfourteen we were all together with one teacher, and I remember the teacher screaming at\nus because you can imagine boys and girls, everybody in one room, and I used to talk a\nlot. I would talk and talk and talk. So, they -- she had me sit alone under her nose, which\nI did not like.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I just studied how to read and write and add. It was really simple. I\nmean, I was very much behind. When I moved to (?__??) it took me a year to catch up,\nbecause I barely -- I knew some things, but very much less than other kids did. It\u2019s hard\nto know how the war affected us, because by the time I have any memory at all, you\nknow, that was all I knew.",
        "A: (2?)",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think we had to blackout the windows, we did that ourselves. I\ndon\u2019t -- I have a very, very vague memory, that may have been an early memory of -- we\nhad a trench in the garden and going in there, seems like in the evening, or at night, when\n-- when there were airplanes above us. The airplanes were scary because you never knew\nwhat they were going to do, where the bombs would fall. They never fell on us, but it\nwas -- I think they were -- you know, the food restrictions, which I remember the most. I\nthink -- I was told, I didn\u2019t know that, but I was told you couldn\u2019t butcher animals. Gas,\ngasoline was restricted.",
        "A: Not that I knew, no.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember anything about Jews. I remember being -- the priest talking\nabout Jesus and me developing a great love for -- for a man who was described as loving\nchildren, and I think for me the connection was, my family was not very loving and it was\nnice to have an idea that someplace there was somebody who was looking after you. So,\nthat\u2019s what I remember about the church. It was -- it was a good place. I liked it.",
        "A: No, no. My parents did not, and I think they were very -- my mother is, I remember,\nwas very unhappy if I -- I always wanted to cross myself and I don\u2019t know if -- when I\nwas a kid if I could do it or not, but afterwards, it was forbidden. It was like a very bad\nthing, and yet, it\u2019s funny, even to this day, when something really bad happens, you\nknow, the impulse is still there on me to do it.",
        "A: Sure. Yeah. No, it wouldn\u2019t have been -- especially the men, they didn\u2019t necessarily\ngo that much. It was the family we were friendly with, Francois and her husband, Marcel.\nFor instance, Marcel was a communist. I don\u2019t know if he was a communist at that time,\nor if it existed, but he was fiercely anti-religion. Oh, he hated the priest. He hated the\nidea of -- it\u2019s funny, he still is. His wife, of course, was Catholic. Everybody was\nCatholic in the village. You know, everybody had been baptised. And -- you know, I\ndon\u2019t think she went much to church, either. I mean, you were Catholic because that was\npart of your -- of your way of living, everyone was baptised, it was normal. But you\ndidn\u2019t have to practice. So, that not very many people would go to church. But they\nwould go in the priest if they were sick. I mean, you took no chances, and baptisms were\nobligated, communion, first communion.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- well, I would have been too young for first communion, and I don\u2019t think\nthere is more children take communion.",
        "A: I very faintly think there was a ceremony, something with flowers, and I don\u2019t know if\nI went or not.",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t observe -- observe many holidays, no Jewish holidays, in those days.\nNot Christmas\u2019s. I may have gotten a book, or something like that. May have gotten a\npresent, but no.",
        "A: No. No, Easter was not part of the (?___?).",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were sure in the sense that they had proof, or they had seen any signs\nof being Jewish, or like Yamika, or any of the traditional signs. Of course, there were no\nsynagogues in the village, you would have to go 40 kilometers to the town. So, they\ndidn\u2019t have solid proof. On the other hand, I think the name is a Jewish name by itself,\nWaldmann, apparently, Waldmann (vald-man), my parents were -- they had dark hair and\n-- everybody in the family looks more Jewish than I do. I\u2019m the only one with this lighter\nhair and blue eyes, and so, I think everybody suspected. I think it was pretty common\nsuspicion or knowledge. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes and no. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s an interesting story. For -- for most of the people I don\u2019t think\nthere was any incentive, because my father was the doctor and he helped everybody and\nhe was well liked. So, there was no reason to kill the village doctor and then be left\nwithout anybody. On a personal level, it was interesting and more complicated, because\nmuch later on, about 10 years ago, I was -- at first I had believed, that\u2019s what my mother\nhad told me that no one knew in the village. It was a very well-kept secret and that\u2019s why\nwe never had any troubles. I spoke with a man whose -- whose wife was my father\u2019s\nmistress, and this was common knowledge in the village, everybody knew, and he\ncertainly would have had incentive to get rid of him, and he didn\u2019t. He -- he was the one\nwho told me when I mentioned that nobody knew we were Jews in the village, he started\nto laugh and said, \u201cEverybody knew, but we were not animals.\u201d So -- so, we were saved\nby the grace, in a way, of this man, and of the whole village. Certainly they could have\ngotten rid of us.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s interesting, because we -- we have all -- we are all friendly still.\nBut it is also a taboo subject. The relationship between my father and Francois -- when I\nspeak to Francois, which I do quite often from here, I call her. We have never, never\nmentioned -- she calls my father Dr. Valmon (ph), because they have changed their name\nsince, and it\u2019s all really kind of funny, but I feel that she wants her privacy and it\u2019s not to\nme -- for me to -- to invade it, although I am very curious and I would like to ask\nquestions about their relationship, and whatever happened back then. But (? _?).",
        "A: [have very few memories of my childhood. The war years in -- in a way, well it\u2019s a\nparadox, but when I was 10 and I moved to live in the suburbs of Paris, this was to me a\nmuch more painful event than any of the war years. I liked living in the village. I was\nhappy there despite the war, and despite the difficulties, it was a better time in my life,\nand so, the -- the loss at the same time when I was eight, after the war ended my\ngrandfather died and that was a tremendous loss to me, and -- and I have very, very few\nmemories of -- maybe the two years before he died and none -- none at all between eight -\n- eight and ten and a half. I have absolute no memories at all. It\u2019s all erased. But I have\none memory at the end of the war, I remember, it was -- we were standing in front of my\nhouse with my family, I think, and two tanks came with either American or Canadian\nsoldiers, and the Germans stood in between the soldiers, in between the tanks, and they\nthrew their hands up in the air and their weapons fell down, and the soldiers threw us\ngum, which we\u2019ve never seen, like, you kept that piece of gum and chewed on it, I think,\nfor two weeks. At night I would put it away. And that was it. That was the end of the\nwar, and then the woman next -- across the street from us, she was a spinster. Apparently,\nshe had been sleeping with a soldier -- with some soldiers, which -- it makes me laugh,\nbecause when I was a child I thought of her as so ancient. You know, it was like a 90-\nyear-old woman; maybe she was 30 or 40, who knows, but she felt very injured, and so, it\nwas -- it was kind of comical to think of her sleeping with everybody. She got her head\nshaved.",
        "A: German. We only had Germans.",
        "A: Oh hell, no. They wouldn\u2019t have -- nobody in France would shave your head for\nsleeping with a man, but soldiers, you know, German soldiers.",
        "Answer: Yes.",
        "A: Soldiers.",
        "A: Or soldiers.",
        "A: A German soldier. I didn\u2019t know anything about it, of course, until, you know, after\nthe war. Her name was Mademoiselle Levon (ph) and it -- I don\u2019t know. You know,\nthings were done, I think, people got self-righteous in the village afterwards, but I really\ndon\u2019t know much about it. Unfortunately after that, I have no memories. That\u2019s my last\nmemory.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: Ostensibly the reason was because I needed a better education. The truth was that\nAmiens, which was a big town 40 kilometers away, could have provided a perfectly good\neducation for me as a boarder and I could home on the weekends, but my mother wanted\nto move. She wanted out of there, which was understandable. My father did not, but\neventually he gave in, and so, we moved.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: Yes. Unfortunately, they were very, very negative. Even though I was, you know, 11\nat least, I don\u2019t think my parents had explained to me any -- any of what was -- what had\nhappened. And also, because at the same time I was going to the Girl Scouts and the Girl\nScouts were Protestant, the troop, and so, I was -- I went back to church, but this time to\nthe Protestant temple, which again, I liked, because at least they spoke English -- or\nFrench. You know, I could understand some of it. But I remember -- and I have it to this\nday, I am ashamed of the feeling, but I can\u2019t help it, sort of visceral dislike for the way the\npeople looked, the Jews looked, because I did not know that those were the survivors.\nYou know? So, they looked battered and they looked sad and they looked grey, you\nknow? I didn\u2019t know any of that, and so, they looked awful to me, you know, those\npeople compared to the Catholic who were young and, you know, in good health and\ncertainly didn\u2019t have the past. So, I wished I -- I wanted to be like all the other girls. I\nwanted to go to church, you know, legitimately. I wanted to take communion, I wanted to\ncontinue believing in Christ and -- you know, and then -- by then it was a terrible thing,\nand I was required to hate -- hate the Christians, but I had no whelm of hatred in me for\nChristians.",
        "A: That was my mother\u2019s call for allegiance, so-to-speak. If I loved her, you know, I was\nto love her and hate -- love the Jews, hate the Christians, but you can\u2019t make yourself. So,\nwhat happened was the opposite mostly, and the synagogue was terribly boring. I had to\nsit upstairs. I\u2019m an only child, so I didn\u2019t have any siblings to commiserate with. I was\nsitting there with my mother, who didn\u2019t believe in anything, and was, you know, just\nsitting there and I think she was talking with other women. The rituals didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, I missed the church ritual and the respect when you go in the church; you\u2019re quiet,\nyou pray. There, it was just sort of sitting up there watching men in dark suits downstairs.\nThe rabbi, who was mean and ugly. His wife, who was -- her hair was -- head was\nshaved, she was wearing a wig and the wig didn\u2019t fit, and I was just there and I hated it,\nbut I hated it guiltily because I was expected not to, and it meant no -- I didn\u2019t believe in\nGod by then. I felt it didn\u2019t make sense to me. And so, I just put in time because I had to.",
        "A: You know, I really stayed away from knowledge. I didn\u2019t want to learn, I didn\u2019t want\nto know, I didn\u2019t want to be part of it; I married a Methodist, who was not practicing. It\u2019s\nnot that I -- I hid that I was Jewish. I always said I was Jewish, because I feel you\u2019re born\nthis way, you can\u2019t erase it. But I never identified with the Jews. I thought it was more of\na curse to be born a Jew. And so, I really didn\u2019t want to know, and interestingly it\u2019s my\ndaughter, when she was 16, she started asking me questions about the Holocaust and I\nsaid to her, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t know much and you surely don\u2019t need to know, it\u2019s too\nhorrible, forget it.\u201d But she needed to know. She started to read. I started having\nnightmares, and so, I needed to help her. So, I - I started myself to read a little bit and\nbecome, you know, more knowledgeable, so I could talk to her. And it was -- she is now\n29, so it was a slow -- a very slow progression. I still, you know, haven\u2019t seen (?Schorr?)\nor I haven\u2019t seen that new movie, Schindler\u2019s List, because I am very visual and if I see\nsomething like that it\u2019s going to haunt me for months and months and months, if not\nyears. And I figured, I went to the Holocaust Museum and I went through it in a daze, I\ndon\u2019t remember much, except for the shoes and the car -- the wagon. It\u2019s about all I\nremember -- oh no, the picture, the tower of pictures.",
        "A: No. My mother is an only child. But my grandmother was one of 12, I think. So,\nthere must have been a lot of people in Russia, but they never made any attempt -- any\neffort at knowing the family, or I wasn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know their name or anything. My\nfather was one of four. I have an uncle who lives in Munich, who I think may have been\nin a camp and came out. I met him once. Then -- and then the rest of the family, I don\u2019t\nknow. I didn\u2019t even know their names. So my parents, we -- we really, really cut\nthemselves off entirely from family (? _?).",
        "A: No, except for an occasional remark. People don\u2019t think of me -- people who don\u2019t\nknow, don\u2019t think of me as Jewish. I think it\u2019s because Arlette is such an unJewish name,\nor when I was growing up. Personally, no. I can\u2019t remember having been directly\nattacked. The funny thing that happened -- the funniest thing that happened to me was in\nAmerica, and it was a funny story, because I was driving in a car with a woman who was\na social worker and also a nun, and her friend, and the nun did not know I was Jewish and\nas we\u2019re driving, some -- some car cuts her off and she says, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a Jew. They are\nso pushy.\u201d At which point I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t let you get away with that.\u201d So, I said, \u201cI\nam a Jew\u2019, and she was so embarrassed. It was funny, but it was also pretty innocent, I\nfelt. And so, once in a while I hear remarks like that. Some -- some woman who told me\nabout somebody trying to \u201cJew\u201d her. But I very often -- I didn\u2019t -- I knew the woman\nvery slightly, and I -- I don\u2019t pick up on those things, because I don\u2019t -- I feel they\u2019re too\nstupid, you know, I\u2019m not going to give them -- honour them with a response. So, I\u2019ve\nbeen quite lucky, in retrospect.",
        "A: I came in 1962, and I originally came for a vacation, three weeks\u2019 vacation, then I\ndecided to spend a year to learn the language and also to get away, and then I met my ex-\nhusband at Stanford and within six weeks we were married. We stayed married 10 years,\nand have two children, and once I had the children I could not see taking them to France\nand cutting them -- basically it would have been cutting them off from their father, which\nI did not want to do to them. I\u2019d been enough -- through enough separations that I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to impose that on them. So, I stayed. I stayed in this country.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m just thinking, you know, about my grandfather and leaving the village, you\nknow, those kinds of disruptions as a child. When you\u2019re a child what you need are roots.\nA divorce is bad enough, but you don\u2019t want any deceptions, you don\u2019t want any changes.\nSo, that\u2019s why I stayed here.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Mm hm.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: I think, for me, the war might have been like thunder in the background. You know\nwhen you hear thunder at the distance and in a way you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to\ncome closer or move away. So, there is some sense of danger. Like, there are planes in\nthe night. Years later when -- I don\u2019t even know. Oh no, there was one thing I never\nunderstood exactly why I felt that way, it was listening to machine gun fire, or any kind of\ngun shooting. I don\u2019t know if it was from that one experience, or what, but that would\nabsolutely make me shake, and that surprised me, because, you know, I was not really\npart of any very traumatic events that I can think of, but that -- that - I would have a\ntremendous response to that. I just couldn\u2019t stand it. Now, it\u2019s getting better, but in\nmovies I\u2019m careful, because it could send me -- it used to. I mean, I saw a movie and I\nshook for a good hour and cried. So, there was a sense of danger, I think, which I may\nhave repressed or not want to deal with, because there was some other aspects of my\nchildhood that were good. I certainly wish it never had happened. I mean, not only for\nall the others, of course, but personally that -- I don\u2019t know it was damaging in some ways\nthat I don\u2019t know. I think it was the atmosphere that was poisonous, but poisonous in a\nway that does a child to just absorb, but do not understand.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I think so. Well, I think 1t was either thinking back on it, of course. I think\nfor me the most difficult thing was being a Jew, because the experience was so mixed and\nso poorly integrated, and my sense of identity has been being -- being part of a group I\nnever wanted to be part of, but that I could not leave, nor would I want to leave for sense\nof guilt. I do have a sense of guilt, that\u2019s one of the reasons I didn\u2019t really want to tell the\nstory because I feel, what do I have to tell, you know, so many people have suffered so\nterribly, as I know from the group here and children survivors. You know, I didn\u2019t suffer,\nor -- why not? There 1s this -- this survivor\u2019s guilt. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s a real thing, and it\ncertainly had a profound effect. A sense of insecurity. You know, you never know when\nyou could be asked to move, or asked to leave. You never know if a bomb will fall on\nyour head. But I think it was both, it was the war in general, which all the children,\neverybody in my time suffered from, and it was personal in the difficulty of being a Jew\nand having such strong identification with -- with a man, with Christ, with a religion\nwhich basically also doesn\u2019t exist very much; it\u2019s an idea in my head. The Catholic\nChurch, I wouldn\u2019t be part of it if you paid me at this time, because there are many things\nI think they are doing which are not (? _?), because they didn\u2019t fight the Germans either\nvery much. So, it\u2019s a place that\u2019s sort of -- it\u2019s sort of no-man\u2019s-land, you know? And\nthat\u2019s it.",
        "A: No. I think my career -- I have -- I was lucky to -- to have found -- to have found a\ncareer that really met a lot -- a lot of needs for me, and in which I have a sense of my life.\nHaving made a little difference, I worked with adults most of my life as a psychotherapist.\nI\u2019m now going to work with children, which I look forward to. I think I have a sense of --\na sense, a need, a wish, of -- to help those who are less fortunate. The greatest pain I have\n-- it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s interesting because it has nothing to do with the war, or maybe it does, is\nof being in exile. I did not really wanted to leave France. I left mostly to escape my\nparents, not the Germans. I can\u2019t go back. I\u2019d go back, but I cannot go back because my\nchildren are here, my life is here, and all I know, I think, I survived much better than other\npeople. I was lucky. And well, you know, like many in New York, Jews are not Jews,\nwe all pay the price for the time we were born.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name is Joseph Valmon (ph). In 1955, \u00b053, I don\u2019t know, something like\nthat, he changed his name from Waldmann to Valmon (ph) when he became a French\ncitizen. And my mother\u2019s name is Fanni Valmon (ph), and (?__?) was her maiden name.",

        "A: My mother practiced medicine, but only in the house. She never -- she was -- stayed\nin an auxiliary role. She never went to see patients outside, but patients came to the house\nand she practiced that way. She was not a very (? _?) practitioner. She preferred not to.\nBut she -- she did help my father. He was really the main one, person, in terms of work.",
        "Answer: Okay. One of the reasons I wanted to tell my story and this was very strong for\nme when I first started thinking about it, was it is a story of hope and it is also a story that\ncounteracts so many of the -- of the stories of people who had been turned in by the\nFrench, who had been persecuted, who had been betrayed. In my case -- and it feels for\nno reason in a way, it was just pure kindness, or pure decency, on the part of the people.\nThey were just -- they were not killers. That\u2019s what the man said, \u201cWe are not animals.\u201d\nMaybe (? _?) human nature is -- is very much that too. That despite the other side of\nthe story, that there is a lot of compassion and I want to say thank you to the people who\nsaved us, and also say that perhaps there were other stories like mine, but I\u2019m not\nregarded because people may not think about telling them, or being in the position to tell\nthem. That I was not -- we were not alone, my family was not alone in having been\nhelped. As a matter of fact, there was a whole village in -- in the (?_?) in which the\npriest led all the people, to save the Jews, and so, those are the stories that I want people\nto know about. And that is it.",
