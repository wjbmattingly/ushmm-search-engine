        "INTERVIEW WITH DR. ROBERT GRUBER\nJUNE 16, 1992\nPOTOMAC, MARYLAND\nThe date is June 16, 1992 and we are speaking with Dr. Robert Gruber\nin Potomac, Maryland. Dr. Gruber, could you please tell me your\nname, your date of birth, your place of birth and anything you\npossibly can about your childhood.\nMy name is Robert Gruber and my date of birth is December 6, 1933.\nPlace of birth, Kosice, Czechoslovakia. I remember very little\nfrom before the age of about five. One of my first vivid memories\nis, in fact, connected with the events of the persecutions. I was\nborn in a relatively large, for that area of the world, city in\neastern Czechoslovakia, Kosice. And in 1938 when Hitler took over\nCzechoslovakia, Kosice was given over to the Hungarians and within\na very short time, the Hungarians came in. One of my first memories\nis, in fact, being in the main street in Kosice and watching the\nHungarian victory parade with the leader of the Hungarians, Admiral\nHorthy, on a white horse leading a column of Hungarian soldiers\ndown the main street. This all looked pretty glamorous to me but\nwithin a couple of days, the rule came down that all Jews who were\nnot Hungarian citizens, which our family was not, had to leave that\narea that the Hungarians took over within 48 hours. So that's one\nof my first memories. Now one interesting thing is in terms of the\nbackground might be that this entire section of Czechoslovakia did\nhave a fair number of Jews. They were pretty much all orthodox,\nalthough not--Hasidism was not very much, very popular in that area.\nIt was more, I guess, intellectually orthodox, elastic type of\northodoxy, rather than the more emotional Hasidic orthodoxy. But,\nyou know, things were very much different that they are here now\nand during that time arranged marriages were still very much in\npractice. So that my parents were actually married as a result of\na get-together that was arranged and paid for by a professional\nmatchmaker. My father received a dowry which was still traditional\nin those days. But, of course, I didn't--wasn't alive then so I\ndidn't know much about it but it's part of the lore that I have\nlearned.\nWere both of your parents from that area?\nNot too far from that area, probably about... Actually my mother\nwas from a town somewhat smaller city, town called Michalovce and",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "2\nI'll refer to it again later on in the story, which was probably\nabout 40, 50, 60 miles from Kosice. My father had a much more\ncomplicated history. He was born in eastern--in Ruthenia\n(ph) (c.36) actually, eastern Ruthenia and became orphaned when he\nwas fourteen years old during the time of the first World War.\nSpent some very difficult years in Budapest and then eventually\ndrifted over to Czechoslovakia as a result of one of his older\nbrothers having established himself in that area. He opened up a\njewelry shop in Kosice. My mother did not live in Kosice then but\nthis matchmaker knew of this person in Kosice looking for a\nprospective bride. And he hooked them up together. After they\nmarried, they did settle in Kosice at that time. But as I say, I\nremember very little of the years in Kosice. The--I guess I didn't\nsay that my initial language that I learned was Hungarian. That\nwas my mother tongue even though I was born in Czechoslovakia\nbecause that was the part of Czechoslovakia which was ethnically\nvery Hungarian. Also this area, not too long before, had been part\nof the Austrian-Hungarian empire. And I think Jews, in particular,\ntended to identify more with the Hungarian people than with the\nSlovakia people. So that, you know, my mother who had gone to of\ncourse, schools still under the Austrian-Hungarian empire--but\nthat's what she spoke fluently and perfectly. So actually, as far\nas I know, I didn't learn to speak Slovakian until I began school\nat the age of six. But I don't remember having any particular\ndifficulty learning then. So let me kind of pick up the story a\nlittle bit after we got to Michalovce because when we were asked to\nleave within 48 hours, the place my parents chose to go to was my\nmother's hometown which was Michalovce which was still part of\nCzechoslovakia that was on its last legs at that point. And, let's\nsee...\nYou got to Michalovce.\nYes, we got to Michalovce and that's where I begin to have my first\nmemories that are fairly vivid and fairly clear. For--initially\nfor, I guess, the first year or so, we couldn't find a place to\nlive so we lived with my mother's family, with her sister and\nbrother-in-law in fairly crowded circumstances. As I remember, and\nonly very vaguely, I began to--even before I started regular school,\nI had already started Cheder which one usually began at the age of\nfour or five. Let's see what else can I remember about that time?\nHad--did your father found work there?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "3\nWell, that's part of the story and one thing that'll become clear\nas I tell this story is that the way we survived was because of a\ngreat deal of luck, really, and circumstances that kind of came\ntogether in just the right way. For example, my father who was a\njeweler and a jewelry manufacturer rather than a store owner, he--\nwhen we moved to Slovakia, he could not... He wanted to open a\nshop there but he couldn't because by that time Czechoslovakia had\nbroken up, Slovakia had become an independent fascist republic and\nbecause he was not a citizen--in fact he had always been stateless,\nmy father had never had citizenship with any country. Because he\nwas not a citizen, he was not able to get a license to open a shop.\nSo after a while, after struggling around for a while, he came up\nwith the idea of getting a partner who was a citizen with whom he\nwould jointly open a shop. And he happened to find a jeweler who\nwas a Christian person who was alcoholic and not really that\ninterested in running the shop as long as he was fairly adequately\nprovided for. So the shop that my father opened was really under\nhis name, legally belonged to him and what makes that important is\nthat because of that, when later on all Jewish businesses and stores\nwere taken over, were Aryranized as it was called at that time, and\na very good depiction of that is in the movie, The Shop on Main\nStreet, the Aryanization. When all the stores were Aryanized, this\ndid not apply to my father's shop because it was not a_e shop\nofficially owned by a Jewish person. So my father was able during\nsome of these difficult years to continue to make money which, as\nthe story will enfold, became also very important for our survival.\nBut this was a totally sort of combination of circumstances that he\nhad not planned on. He planned, he wanted to be able to open his\nown shop but because of these circumstances he wasn't able to do\nso. So then gradually, I guess, he established himself with this\nnew partner and we started, let's see, '39, '40. By that time, as\nsoon as I think Slovakia became--very shortly after they became an\nindependent fascist republic, they started passing some laws against\nthe Jews. And I don't know exactly the order of them, but it was\nlaws like-- you know, one day the law would be that no Jews could\ngo into parks. So as a kid, you know, there were parks around, I\nwasn't able to go and play in the parks. No Jews would be allowed\nto go to the movies. This town wasn't that big and we had one\nmovie but still it was a--it seemed like a very exciting, glamorous\nplace to go to but there was no way I could go to a movie during\nthat time. The other rule was something like no Jews in restaurants\nand that didn't--we hadn't gone out in restaurant---didn't seem",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "4\nlike a deprivation. They didn't have any McDonalds, you know that\nI would have been deprived of. But that gives you some sense of\nthe gradually kind of eating away at your freedoms that took place\nduring that time. I guess what I remember and somewhat vaguely but\npretty much though, is the growing sense of fear and anxiety and\ntension that all of my family and all the people around us about\nwhat was going to happen. I mean,---clearly, no one expected\nanything good to happen but perhaps at this point no one quite\nanticipated how bad things would be either. Then I think by the\ntime I started first grade, no Jews were allowed in regular public\nschools. So that essentially under the sponsorship of the Jewish\ncommunity, there was a Jewish school with exclusively Jewish kids.\nThey--I think it only went up to 6th grade and after a while that's\nas far as a person could go there, a Jewish person could go in their\neducation, was 6th grade.\nSo, did you originally attend the public schools?\nI think by the time I was, let's see, was 1940 I was six years old\nby the time I would have started first grade. I think by that time\nalready, the Jews were not allowed to go to public schools. In\nfact this picture, 'cause this is the second grade, I supposed I\nstarted in '39, '40. Now I don't--may have started in public school\nbut I really don't have any recollection of the first grade. But\nby the second grade, as you can see in the year 1940-41, I was in\nan all--this is my picture--I was in an all Jewish school. In\nfact, at that point, they were segregated into boys and girls in\ndifferent classes. Should I comment on the picture?\nYeah, yeah.\nAs a matter--this obviously--this picture is of some interest\nbecause it does have--shows at least the teacher and principal who\nare pictured along with the students. They wear yellow bands which\nwere at that time required for Jews to wear to identify themselves.\nI don't really remember most of the children here in this picture\nso I can't tell you who survived and who didn't for sure. But I\nwould guess that since about 60 to 70% of Slovakian Jews were killed\nin the Holocaust, that probably the same percentage is true here.\nThat about 60 or 70% of these boys that were killed in the Holocaust.\nInterestingly, ironically enough, the teacher and the principal\nboth survived actually. While I'm on the pictures, I might just\nmention the earliest picture here is one taken at my aunt's wedding.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "5\nThis is my father, this is my mother, this is me and this is my\nSister. This is my mother's sister who was getting married and\nthis is her husband, (c.156) husband, and these are two other\naunts, sisters of my mother. All of these people were killed, all\nexcept our immediate family, in the Holocaust.\nYou would have been about four years old there?\nIn there, I'm probably a little younger than that. I think I'm\nprobably about three years old. My sister is about four years old.\nI think the wedding actually took place in Kosice although my aunt\nwas from Michalovce.\nInteresting.\nYeah. So it was with these--with this aunt and uncle that we lived\nfor some period of time when we first moved to Michalovce. Now\nmaybe you can ask me some questions specifically about the life\nthere before I get into the--more directly into the story.\nOkay, sure. Well, after you moved out from living with your aunt\nand uncle, you got your own place, is that...?\nYeah, we got an apartment. You know, a reasonable one by the\nstandards of that place. In many ways, this whole area was really\nfairly primitive, certainly by--even by today's standards there.\nBut certainly by American standards, they would have been very\nprimitive. There were very few cars in that area, there was lots\nof horse-drawn traffic, wagons and so on. There was even a vestige\nfrom the past, in that there was a castle at the edge of town, where\nthe count, the local count lived. And when they would go by in the\nstreet, they would be in a horse-drawn coach with their emblem\nthere, inSignia on the side of the coach. So there was--it's a\nvery agricultural area, there was--at least at that time. Now I've\nbeen on a return trip there a couple of years ago and many of these\nsmall towns during the communist era, they had built a lot of\npolluting industries and terrible-looking modern cinder block\nhousing projects. But in those days, it was very agricultural.\nDo you remember what the town looked liked then?\nYeah, it was really mostly--consisted of one very long main street\nthat stretched from the railroad station on one end, probably two",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "6\nor three miles long to the other end where there was a creek and\nbeside the creek was the count's castle. And then there were a\ncouple of streets parallel to this main street but not nearly as\nbig or prominent as this main street really. All the stores,\nessentially, were on that main street. On that main street, you\nalso had the Jewish synagogue which for a town of that size, which\nwas about 15,000 population, was a fairly magnificent synagogue\nboth inside and outside. But on that main street was a town hall,\nthe post office, main post office and all the streets--all the\nstores. A number of the stores probably a majority of the stores\nwere owned by Jews aS was typical in that area. Because, with the\nexception of very few Jews, most Jews were not part of the landed\ntype of work so that owning businesses and professions is what they\nwere engaged in.\nYou mentioned also that the Jews from that area were prominently\nobservant. Was your family, did you observe the Sabbath and..?\nYes, I think with very few exceptions, you know, with the exception\nof some rebels who longer observed, most people did observe. There\nwas certainly--we had kosher food and everything. That was to be-\n-that was standard expectation even though my parents, by standards\nof some, were actually fairly moderate. Because in that area, many\nwomen still wore wigs whereas that was not true for my mother. In\nmany households, practically the only language spoken within the\nhousehold was Yiddish; that was not true in our _ household.\nGenerally, we spoke Hungarian although my parents did speak Yiddish\nto each other when they wanted to keep something secret from us.\nAnd we never--my sister and I never quite learned it that well\nalthough we picked it up some. But--by the standards of some part\nof the Jewish community, our family would have been called, you\nknow, fairly modern, rather than traditional but it certainly was\nexpected that we would have--you know, keep kosher and go to shul\non Saturday morning, my father and I, as I became older and observe\nessentially all the holidays. Some of the more religious people\nwould go every morning, would go in at 6 o'clock and do two or three\nhours of studying the Torah or the Talmud before going and starting\ntheir ordinary day.\nWas there a yeshiva in the town?\nNo, there was no yeshiva in town. But in Slovakia, I forget exactly\nthe name of it, but in the capital of Slovakia, Bratislava",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "7\n(ph) (c.233) or Presswer, I think there were some very famous center.\nShe was center .\nWhat about Zionist activity?\nNow, that's an interesting question because again the community was\nso traditional at that point, that they really for the most part\nhad very little use for Zionist activities. The belief was that,\nyou know, the day the Messiah came is when one would go back to\nPalestine, and not before. There was almost something sacrilegious\nabout becoming a Zionist and trying to reestablish the State of\nIsrael before the return--before the coming of the Messiah. And\nso--but some of the younger people did become Zionists and they\nwere looked at somewhat askance by the more traditional view. My\ncousin, actually both my cousins who lived in Michalovce. who were\nsomewhat, who were five or six years actually more like eight or\nten years older than I, they had both become involved in Zionism.\nNot only that but to the consternation of their parents, they became\ninvolved in Hashomer Hatzair, which was not only Zionistic but\nleftist and atheist in those days. But that was a source of great\ndistress and embarrassment to their parents, that they were....\nBut pretty generally, as I said, the opinion was that Zionism was\nnot consistent with good Judaism.\nI actually worked with a woman who now is an Australian who is from\nMichalovce and was very involved, I know, in the Zionist movement.\nHer name was Magda Hellinger (ph) (c.256).\nFor all I know, my mother probably knows her.\nI know she is very.... Her father taught in the school.\nMy cousin taught in the Jewish school.\nI believe so, yes.\nThe name seems familiar to me. These teachers, this one is\nBernstein, that's Brown. But it sounds like a familiar name to me.\nShe would be quite a bit older than you are.\nBut she would probably be about--well probably younger than my\nmother. But my mother would probably have known her pretty well.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "8\ncheck, just wondering.",
        "It sounds like a familiar name.\nYeah, I mean I haven't met anyone else from that town, So...\nYeah.\nSo okay, do you remember any of the--what it was like to go to\nschool?\nYeah, I remember. I suppose I remember this even though it was a\nJewish school, rather than a part of a regular school. My memory\nof it, you know, didn't have so much to do, at least initially with\nthe fact of its being a Jewish school. I mean the usual stuff of\nlooking forward to recess and playing soccer and other games during\nrecess, you know, struggling with it to be a good boy or a bad boy\nin class. In those days--certainly corporal punishment was still\nvery much a part of education in those days. So the teachers would\nhave a bamboo stick and if you misbehaved in class, then you had to\ngo and take your punishment and extend out your hand and wait for\nit to be switched and struck by the teacher with the bamboo stick.\nAnd it stung, it stung pretty badly.\nSo you experienced this?\nI experienced that, yeah. And when he really got mad, then you had\nto bend over and get a few lashes on your behind. And that was\nperfectly accepted practice, there was no complaints from parents\nabout it in those days. I suppose most of them did think they were\ndoing the right thing but it didn't feel like it.\nWas there a sense though, that they knew you had to be in this\nschool?\nWell, some. But again, it was part of the whole picture of\ngradually being deprived of privileges and freedom. In the first\ntwo or three years, my memory of it isn't clear enough to really be\nable to answer that kind of question, but certainly, one might say\nin some ways things were getting worse and worse. There was--being\nin an all Jewish environment probably had its good side too in terms\nof being in a community with other people going through the same",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "9\nthing. And so there was some sense, I think, of mutual support\nfrom that as well. But interestingly enough, this has always\nastounded me that through all the times during the war, even after\nthere had been transports and a fair people were deported, that\nthose who still remained, as much as they both worried about their\nfriends and relatives who had been taken and as much as we all\nworried what would happen to all of us eventually, that we all--I\nthink there was a tendency to try and maintain a semblance of\nnormality as much as possible. And so that whether it involved\npeople getting together socially, you know, having card parties,\nkids worrying in school about whether they got their homework right,\nwhether the teacher is going to get mad at them or not, whether\ntheir parents are going to get upset with their grades; to some\nextent that still remained part of life. And probably it was\nhelpful part of life in creating some balance for the all the other\nworrisome things. So I remember particularly as I myself, I was\nsort of an average indifferent student, the first three or four,\nthe first three grades. And then suddenly, I became a very\noutstanding student in the fourth grade and got a lot of praise for\nit. I remember that that meant a lot to me. And as--you know, at\nthe same time vaguely remembering also worrying about other kids\nbeing jealous of me and trying to put me down by mocking me and so\nthese were all part of life, even during those very difficult times.\nWould you like to discuss the course of events then, of how...?\nYeah, right, I'll be glad to. Well, I suppose I already mentioned\nthese laws that were being gradually passed. In the beginning of\n1942, the first transports began. Initially, the people who were\nsubject to being transported were young people, really late\nadolescents and kids in their early twenties, both male and female,\nunattached, single and so on. These were the first population that\nwas subject to deportation. So that didn't personally affect us\nalthough one of my cousins was in that category. And she\nfortunately, well not so fortunately because eventually she was\nkilled, but at least during that period of time, she hid out and so\nwas not caught in that group. But as I understand, maybe my\nhistorical knowledge isn't totally accurate, but this group that\nthey got from Slovakia were really used, these young people, to\nbuild some of the camps. I think some of them really were involved\nin building Auschwitz during that time. So a few of that group\nactually survived on to the end of the war, having become kapos and\nso on but most of them were killed. In fact, about 95, 98% of the",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "10\nkids that were caught at that time were. Now the next law that\ncame out did affect us. The next group that was subject to\ndeportation were men, Single or married, within a certain age range.\nMy father was in that age range. This was all on the up and up at\nthat time, so to speak, so the announcements were made publicly,\nthat at such and such a time, these people would be expected to\nreport for relocation or deportation to labor camps in the eastern\nterritories. This was all done by the Slovakian authorities. This\nwas not done by Germans.\nWas there any type of a Jewish council in this community?\nYes, there was a Jewish council. Throughout this period of time,\nthere was a Jewish council, I think both locally and statewide in\nSlovakia, that tried to intervene on behalf of the community.\nThere'll be a couple of instances where I'll mention they actually\nwere effective in securing something but I don't know whether at\nthat point they were particular effective. I'm not sure, I just\ndon't know enough about that. So then--I mean--again an excellent\nexample of the kind of--how chance played a tremendous role in\nSurvival. The way my father was going to avoid this particular\ndeportation was that he and a Jewish journeyman of his were going\nto hide out in his\u2019 shop. And presumably, since this shop was\nlegally a Christian establishment, they would not come and look for\nhim there. This shop actually happened to be practically adjoining\nthe apartment where we lived, there was just a wall that separated\nour apartment from the shop. And this I have a, you know, a memory,\nnot a very vivid one, but a memory for that my father and this\njourneyman of his were going to spend the evening in our apartment\nplaying cards with the plan that later on--for some reason or\nanother--they didn't expect, you know the raid to begin until late\nat night; that later on they would move to the shop and hide out\nthere. But my mother had a headache and after they played there\nfor about half an hour, she said, I want to go to bed, why don't\nyou go to the shop now? And so they did, Within about 15 minutes,\nthe police, the gendarmes were at the door, looking for my father.\nThey looked all around the apartment, under the beds, in the closets\nand anywhere; and of course, they didn't find any because he was\nalready in the shop. But had my mother not had a headache, you\nknow, he would have been taken and if he had been taken, I doubt\nvery much if any of the rest of us would have survived. So there\nwas a whole series of things like that.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "11\nThey didn't assault the rest of the family because...?\nNo, because--they didn't assault. They grilled my mother, where\nis he. My mother said, I don't know, he just went off somewhere.\nI think it's a little humid here, I'm going to put down.... The\nnext thing and this was, I guess around April, May, I guess April,\nearly May of 1942 came the new law, that all families unless exempted\nwould be subject to deportation. The law was very specific about-\n- and was presented as if for our own good--to teach us the virtues\nof labor. The law was very specific about luggage, how much per\nperson and so on and so forth. And this was to be--everybody was\nto report some time in advance, I think two weeks from the time\nthat the law was announced. And so that was the big thing--how\nwere people going to react to this. Most of them, I would say\nreally saw no option but to comply. You know, you have to remember\nthat this was at a time in the war when an allied victory seemed\nvery far away. So that there seemed little prospect, you know, of\nfinding any hiding place that would last for years. So most people\nresigned themselves to just complying with the law, including a\nnumber of my immediate relatives in the same town including the\naunt and uncle that I mentioned before. They had a little daughter\nat that point who was about three years old.\nMay I ask you, what--did you have any knowledge of the camps and",
        "?",
        "At that point, we didn't have any knowledge at all. And I supposed\npeople's reactions to this challenged varied to some extent\naccording to their ideas and attitudes about people, life and their\nown character really. So that, for example, in the case of my\nparents, my mother in particular, she tended to be mistrustful which\nturned out to be a very good thing--a very good way to be. So that\nalthough she had no idea, certainly at that point, about any kind\nof systematic extermination but she was very clear that these camps\nwould, at the very least, pose a tremendous danger to my sister and\nme that at the very least, we would be subject to dying of disease\nor of starvation. And she was determined therefore, that no matter\nwhat, no matter how she wasn't going to go along with this law.\nThat had something to do with her character, with her ideas about\nthings. Whereas her sister reacted differently, what else can one\ndo except to go along with it. At that point, you know, there were\na fair number of people who did have exemptions, official\nexemptions, who were not subject to the deportation at that time.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "12\nThe whole history of this thing--you know--you have to remember\nagain that this area was not under direct German control. In the\nareas that were under direct German control, there were never any\nexemptions with regard to Jews but in this case there were. And\nthere continued to be over time. Not necessarily, you know, I\ndon't know what dictated--certainly the more influential you were,\nthe wealthier you were, the more likely you were to have an\nexemption. I'm sure bribing played a role in that and so on. Now\nduring this time, my parents did not have any way to secure an\nexemption. There were different orders of exemptions. There was a\nyellow exemption because it was on yellow paper which is kind of\nthe plebeian exemption; that wasn't so great. And it went all the\nway to the presidential exemption which only a relatively people\nhad and they were most secure during that time. So the only option\nthat my parents had at that time was to try to cross into Hungary\nillegal. This became one avenue that other people also tried to\ntake advantage of. Very soon there was a traffic in illegal parties\ncrossing the boarder into Hungary. Because during that time, even\nthough the Hungarians when they had come in, kicked us out\nofficially, Jews were not being--Hungarian Jews were not being\ndeported in 1942. They were not really even that directly\nthreatened during that time. So my parents arranged to join a\ngroup that had its guide, its leader. It was a business\nproposition. This person, you know, got paid so much per person in\nthe party. Like our group I think consisted of about 13 people,\ntwo or three different families. The actual way we went across was\nduring the night, through open fields and swamps and so on. During\nthe day, after the first night, we hid out and rested and then the\nsecond night we completed our journey across the boarder to the\noutskirts of the nearest Hungarian city or town which was Omvar\n(ph) (c.522), now it's part of Ukraine, it's called Oshgovar (ph)\n(c.524). But at any rate, and by prearrangement we were---when we\ngot to the outskirts of this town around 3 or 4 o'clock in the\nmorning after a really long--I certainly remember very vividly that\ncrossing into Hungary and going in the dark through the fields. At\none point, we ran into a band of Gypsies and we heard them saying\nthere go the Jews running. And then there was a panic that the\nGypsies would go into the next town and tell on the group. But\napparently that didn't happen. I remember, I may remember, for\nexample, you walked on these fields which seemed like only long\ngrass and suddenly you were knee-deep in water because it was\napparently swampy ground underneath and it was getting cold and it\nseemed to go on forever. We finally got to this place which was a",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "13\nsort of farm house at the edge of town with a barn. By\nprearrangement with the owner of this farmhouse and barn, we were\nput up for the rest of the night in the barn. We sort of--on the\nstraw in the barn and we fell asleep because we were all very tired\nat that point. The next thing we know is, we hear Hungarian\npolicemen saying good morning ladies and gentlemen. Will you please\naccompany me to the police station? And so he, in fact, herded us\nthrough the streets of Omguar (ph) (c.556). The men were all\nhandcuffed and took us into prison. For the next week we remained\nthere in jail in Omguar. I personally was in a jail cell with my\nfather and another man. My sister was with my mother and one or\ntwo other woman. Now during that week, apparently---",

        "week rather than returning us immediately to Slovakia. Was--we\nlearned later on that they were actually thinking seriously of\nshooting the whole party as an example to others because so many\npeople were making this illegal crossing during that time. And\nagain another example of how chance worked in our favor, really,\nnot immediately apparent but what happened was that during the time\nwe were there, my father got the idea that since Refini (ph) (c.550)\nwhere he had been born had also become part of Hungary by then,\nthat he decided to come forward to the police captain and show him\nhis birth certificate and claim the fact that he's Hungarian and\nShould be allowed to remain in Hungary. Well the police captain\ntook his birth certificate, tore it into pieces, slapped him on the\nface and pushed him back into the jail cell. Where were we? So\nthat--I'll pick up that thread of the story a little later on. So-\n-and the other thing that we learned and I don't know how true this\nis, that obviously somebody had turned us in because the policeman\nknew exactly where to come. And the best guess was that we were\nactually turned in by the owner of the farmhouse and barn and that\nhis motivation probably was that he expected that everybody would\nhave valuables with them. He didn't undertake that kind of a\nyearning to a new life without trying to convert all that you had\ninto negotiable valuables, like gold, diamonds, dollars and stuff\nlike that. And that the minute the policeman showed up, it would\nall be stashed in the hay; which is exactly what, say for example,\nmy father did, who did have several pounds of gold and diamonds and\nso on being a jeweler. And this man had the gall to come and visit\nus in jail and when my father said, you know, can you find that\nstuff and put it away somewhere for us, for safekeeping?, he said,\nhe looked, he didn't see anything. Yet, later on, he was seen by\nothers to be selling off the stuff to a jewelry store. So at any",

        "14\nrate, they finally did decide to send us back to Brehaalza\n(ph) (c.9).\nDo you remember what it was like to be in this jail?\nYeah, I remember it. It was--it was very scary and strange and\nthen... But one thing I think that's important to remember, that\nthe fact that--and that's true for the entire story--the fact that\nI was always with my parents. It gave me a feeling of security,\nhaving some kind of blind faith that somehow, they'll find a way to\nprotect me or save me. Probably kept me from being as frightened\nall along as being in these kind of situations, one might have been.\nWith a couple of exceptions where I suddenly would sense that maybe\nthey don't know what the hell to do with it, what's going to happen\nwith us. So anyway, interestingly, we were given a choice, the\nparty was given a choice, whether to go back on foot or be taken\nback by bus. I remember as a kid, I wanted the bus ride. You\nknow, aS a little kid in those days, one didn't get to travel much\nand I had all these adventurous ideas about travel. I felt very\ndisappointed that the adults without exception, you know, chose to\nwalk back rather than to take the bus. Because their thinking was,\nthe longer we take to get back to the hell that is waiting for us,\nthe better off we are. So we were in a kind of walk back to the\nborder, handed over to the Slovakian police who then shepherded us\nback finally to our--the town where we started out from. And there\nwe were immediately, of course, put in jail again. And this time,\nI was put ina larger cell but this time with about a dozen women\nand their children. All lying on a plank alongside one end of the\ncell so that we were practically piled up on top of each other.\nWere these Jewish women?\nThese were all Jewish women and children. Those who perhaps had\nalso been caught but most of them just part of the continuing\nprocessing of the Jews who were going to be deported to the camps.\nThe other thing I remember, is that the only toilet facility was a\nroom next to the cell, that you had to ask the guard to let you go\nto. Essentially, you urinated on the floor which is where\neverything was all piled up. Now, a couple of days, and I guess\nthe way these things went, and I'm not sure who was jailed before\nbeing taken. I think some people were directly taken and I think\nthat most people who were in the jail were people who either had\nbeen hiding and were caught and put in jail before they were going",

        "15\nto be transported. Because I remember, we were there for a few\ndays and the first day, we were visited by my aunt and her three-\nyear old daughter. They were about to go directly, I guess, into\nthe transport. Maybe that day, or the next day. Then I remember\nvery well and I remember how, I guess to reassure their child who\nwas a very cute little girl, they told her that they were all going\nto Palestine. She was, you know, talking very enthusiastically\nabout how they were going to go to Palestine. Anyway, after a few\ndays in that jail, our turn came to be taken to the trains. Once\nagain, you know, we were part of a--essentially a herd of people\nthat were shepherded by the gendarmes or the local Slovakian SS\nguard. We were taken and this was one of the times where I....Yeah,\none thing again, from a child's point of view. As that morning\ncame when this whole party in that cell were all to go on to the\ntrains, my mother went into hysterics and kept yelling and screaming\nabout how she, you know, can't stand the idea of having her children\nstarved or so on. She doesn't want to go. I remember as a child,\nfeeling mostly very self-conscious and embarrassed that my mother\nwas making such a big scene during that. I was wishing\nlike (c.631) she'd be quiet. And the other women saying, it's\nall right, it'll be all right. The first place they took us was\nactually to a school and it was a very busy place as new parties of\nJews were being brought in. This was the final act before going on\nto the railroad station to get on the trains. You got your number.\nFrom that point on, you were no longer a person with a name, you\nwere a person with a number anda tag that you had around your neck.\nJust before our turn came to get our numbers, an official came in\nand said anybody who can prove that they are of foreign extraction\nor foreign citizens, please come and see me. At that point, you\nknow, of course, the issue came up again that my father was born in\nRuthenia which was at that point, part of Hungary. Of course, he\nhad had such a bad experience the last time he tried to take\nadvantage of that fact, that he was somewhat hesitant to approach\nthis official about it. But, you know, my mother said, what do you\nhave to lose now? Here's again where chance comes into play. The\nreason he had the--you know the original was torn up by the police\ncaptain in Hungary--the reason he had a duplicate was because they\nhad actually tried to get out of Czechoslovakia as early as 1936\nwhen the times started to get bad. It was very hard to get out of\nCzechoslovakia, much harder than it was to get out of Germany,\nparticularly to the United States which is where he wanted to go\nbecause his brother was here. But even though he got an affidavit\nin 1936, the quota was so discriminatory against Slavic countries",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "16\nbecause of the great immigration from the Slavic areas, so that it\nwas virtually impossible to come to America for someone from\nCzechoslovakia, whereas, there was no discriminatory against\nGermans. That's why so many Germans who elected to come to\nAmerica, German Jews actually did come as late as '38 or '39. So\nat any rate, but in order to go through the process, he had to get-\n-to have two copies of his birth certificate. So he made the trip\nto his hometown, sometime in 1937 or '38 and he did have two copies\nof his birth certificate at his disposal. If he hadn't, I wouldn't\nbe here. So anyway, he showed this man his copy of the birth\ncertificate and the man said, all right, why don't ;you and your\nfamily wait along with maybe one or two other people. And so we\nwere waiting there for, I think, an hour or two hours. In the\nmeantime, people were being just shepherded through. We looked out\nthe window and there was a whole convoy of people being led in the\ndirection of the railroad station. And then a couple of hours\nlater, he comes back and he says, all those people that I had asked\nto stay aside and wait, please come and follow me. He went to the\nfront door and he said, you are free to go home. Now and here\nagain, you know, the combination of chance and circumstance, because\napparently that was the first day when people who had--were not\ncitizens of foreign countries were exempt. Prior to that time,\nonly people who were citizens with a valid passport from another\ncountry were exempt from deportation. So that probably the fact\nthat we did try to go to Hungary, that we did go there, the fact\neven that they kept us for a week in the jail there rather than\nreturning us immediately, and delayed the whole process, saved our\nlives during that--even perhaps if it was true that they were\nthinking of shooting us in Hungary--that helped to save us during\nthat moment. So then we went back to our apartment which had all\nbeen officially sealed and my father had to go to the police station\nto have an official come and unseal the apartment and so on. And\nSo we got back and for the next few weeks, I started going back to\nschool. Of course, I was---many fewer kids were in that school at\nthat point and I had only been there a few weeks before because in\nthis first wave of deportation, a great many of the Jews were\ndeported during that time. Probably a very small percentage\nSurvived because most of them were taken to the extermination camps\ndirectly--Sobibor, Treblinka, I think, and Majdanek. We did get\npostcards and, as I say, most of my relatives were taken during\nthose transports. In fact, between relatives, both in Slovakia,\nan uncle in Germany, an uncle in Poland and their respective\nfamilies; of about 25 relatives, uncles, aunts, cousins; there was",

        "only one person that survived besides our immediate family. So for\na few weeks, you know, as far as we knew, things were okay. Then\none Saturday morning, there's a knock on our door and the police\nare there. They name each of our names, I don't know, remember the\nGarden of the Finzi-Continis remember at the end where the police\ncomes in and calls out everybody's name? that's exactly the way it\nwas. The police called each of our names including my sister's and\nmine and said please pack up and get ready to come to go to\n(c.140). Then what followed was almost a comedy routine.\nThese were Slovakian fascists guardists, not very sophisticated.\nMy mother said she can't go, she's sick, she can't get out bed. My\nfather says to them, look I'm a manager of the shop, of this\nChristian shop right next door. If you take me, are you willing to\nbe responsible for all the contents in that shop? Besides which,\nsays my father, this is all a mistake and I can go to one of the\nofficials and have it fixed up right away. So these policemen\ndecided the following: They had other business to transact, other\nJews to pick up. If my father gave them his word of honor that he\nwouldn't try to escape, they would let him go and see whether he\ncould get some official intervention on his behalf. But they would\nkeep coming back during the day to make sure that my mother, my\nSister and I were not trying to escape. So the minute they walk\nout, my mother turns to my father and says, we got to run. And my\nfather say with a bit of fame, but I gave my word of honor. How\ncan I escape? So he went off to see what he could do, you know,\nwhether he could get some intervention from the officials that he\nknew. But my mother regardless of what he had said, kept trying to\nsee if we could escape. But every time, she was still in bed. She\nwas officially sick, you see. Too sick to move. Every time she\ntried to get dressed so that he and the two of us, the two of us\nchildren could take off together, the police would be back. She\nimmediately had to take all of her clothes off and put her nightgown\nback on and get under the covers so that was a kind of comedy\nroutine aspect of this day. In the meantime, my father found that\nhe couldn't get any help from any officials but he talked to some\nother people, some other Jewish people in the street, told them his\nSituation. They all told him he was crazy to worry about word of\nhonor and by then he got word back to us that we should run if we\ncan and that he was going to meet us at some designated place at\nthe end of the day. Eventually, what happened was my mother simply\nput a raincoat on and ran across the street to Jewish people who\nwere at that point exempt, where she stayed for the rest of the\nday. Again my father's journeyman took my sister and me across",

        "18\ntown to the place where everybody was supposed to converge at the\nend of the day which was the home of the parents of one of my\nfather's apprentices.\nThese are 2(c.184)\nThe Journeyman was Jewish but the apprentice was a Christian friend,\na gentile friend. So there was some further adventures but I won't\ngo into details but we all finally did get together that evening in\nthat place, in that home. As a Jewish kid and the first time really\nI was in a Christian home; there are crosses all over the walls and\nI didn't know quite what to make of that. But we were there for a\nday, two days and pretty soon these people, whose house it was,\nwere getting a little nervous and uneasy. Clearly, that wasn't the\nplace where we could--there was no hiding place really. There\nwasn't a place where you could stay for very long. Then what\nhappened was my parents got word through the apprentice whose\nparents' house we were at, that the chief of police had come to my\nfather's shop and told my father's partner that he would like to\nspeak to Gruber and him. And that if my father's partner knew\nwhere Gruber was, to let him know that he wants to talk to my\nfather. So my parents got that message and they had to make a\ndecision, whether to accept this invitation or ignore it. I imagine\nthey had a pretty hard time making a decision but the alternative-\n- I mean there was an implied promise that there may be a deal in\nthe making. The alternative, namely of trying to stay there was\nreally impossible for any length of time. So then my parents\ndecided that yes, my father would go with his partner and see the\nchief of police. I do remember that day when my father left early\nin the morning and it was hours and hours and we heard nothing about\nhim or from him. Obviously, we were scared stiff about what\nhappened to him. Finally he showed up. What had happened was\nthis, that he got there with his partner. He was made to wait a\ncouple of hours. Finally the chief of police saw both of them and\nhe asked my father's partner, do you need this Jew, Gruber for your\nshop? My father's partner said yes, you know, it's important to\nhave somebody who can manage these things and so on and so forth.\nAnd then the police says, but of course you can't have any objection\nif I can find a Gentile who can do the same job. My father's\npartner said, I guess not. And so, okay, let me call the Ministry\nof Labor in Bratislava to see if I can find you a Gentile person\nwho can take over the management. So while my father was there, he\ncalled up the Ministry of Labor, asked them questions, took a while",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "19\nfor the answer to come back. Finally the answer was no, that there\nwas no qualified Gentile jeweler who could come and take over the\nshop. So he gave my father a temporary exemption and on the\nstrength of this, we all came out of our hiding and went back to\nOur apartment. But apparently that wasn't the final chapter on\nthis. A few weeks later there was--apparently the town council or\nwhatever it was that had both the town functionaries decided case\nby case, made final decisions about whether this or that person\nwould be exempt. Apparently what we heard later on was that when\nour case came up, actually most of them wanted to send us off. But\nit was the president of the chamber of commerce that said if they\nsend my father off, he would resign as president of the chamber of\ncommerce. Now the reason for that was this: as you may or may not\nknow, at the time of the Czechoslovakia republic, really most of\nthe industry was in the Czech part, not the Slovakian part, so that\nSlovakia was very underdeveloped in terms of industry and even\ntrades, very skilled trades. So that there were not very many\nmaster jewelers. I talked to him about it--this goes all the way\nback to the guild system. To become a jeweler, you had to be an\napprentice for a few years and then a journeyman for another couple\nof years until you became a master jeweler. My father's shop had\nfour Gentile apprentices so that these were four future Gentile\nSlovak master jewelers who this president of the chamber of commerce\nfelt were sorely needed because there were so few. His idea was\nthat if my father was sent, the shop would collapse. Because he\nknew that really my father, even though officially it belonged to\nhis partner, that it was he who was making it run. And so his\nopinion prevailed and we did get a more firm kind of exemption.\nNow one never knew during that time how long an exemption like this\nwould last. Just as, you know, after the first time when we were\nlet go, just six weeks later, they were ready to send us off again.\nThere were different groups of people who had been exempt for a\nperiod of time and suddenly the rules changed. For example, for\nsome period of time, American citizens were exempt. There were\nsome American citizens, people who had emigrated before the war,\nwho then returned home after securing an American citizenship.\nSuddenly, the grapevine had it that, and they were correct, that\nthe Americans--that exemption was going to drop. Word got out\nenough in advance that most of the people involved were able to\nhide. So the next day came this is all a mistake, American citizens\nare still exempt and will continue to forever be exempt. A couple\nof days later, when everybody had come out of the hiding, they were\nable to get most of them and deport them. So various groups, you",

        "20\nnever knew what was going to happen next. At some point, a new law\ncame into effect that families in which at least one member had\nconverted to Christianity prior to 1938, would be exempt. The idea\nof making it prior to 1938 was with the idea--they didn't want\nopportunistic--it had to be sincere. Of course, who converted\nprior to 1938? Very few, if any people. But necessity is the\nmother of invention and pretty a whole trade developed around false\nconversion papers. Now these were real in the sense that priests\nwere involved in giving them, actually selling them to Jews. They\nwould make these out, you know, where one person in the family had\nSupposedly converted prior to 1938. As witnesses, they would put\ndown the names of people who had died in the meantime so they could\nnever be challenged. As I say, a whole trade developed and---but\nthe funny thing--this is in terms of the kind of community it was.\nA lot of families still had a lot of trouble about making that\ndecision even though it was, you know, a fake conversion. But the\ntradition that one thing you do not do, is deny the name of the\nLord, was so strong in many of these families that a lot of families\nhad trouble with it. Strangely enough, a child would be picked to\nbe the one who had converted because the parents would refuse to\nhave that blemish on their record. In our case, my father didn't\nhave any problem about that. He volunteered to be the one. But\nsomehow, I remember even those it was only my father, my family\nstill felt that we all should act like we meant it. So for a while\nmy sister and I were taught the catechism by somebody. But then\nafter a certain period of time, the transports stopped. Again, I\ndon't know how much you know of that history but this was one of\nthe few instances where, in fact, the papacy did intervene on behalf\nof the Jews. What happened was--this was after the two---actually\nSlovakian Jews escaped from Auschwitz. I forget their names. They\nbrought back very detailed information about just exactly what was\ngoing on in Auschwitz. They came back to Czechoslovakia, were\nsmuggled by the Jewish officials to Switzerland and gave that\ninformation to the United States officials actually at that point\nbut also to the people delegated. By that point, everything was\nknown, because of that particular report. As a result of that\nknowledge, the Papal Nuncio (c.887) did put a lot of pressure on\nthe Slovakian government to stop the transport. This was within\nthe power of the Slovakian government just as it had been a Slovakian\ngovernment initiative to get the transports going in the first\nplace. This was a very Catholic area. In fact, the Slovakian\nfuhrer was a priest, Monsignor Teasall (ph) (cc.325 was the Slovakian\nfuhrer. Because of that pressure, the transports were stopped for",

We did get postcards from that first wave of people including\nour relatives either from Majdanek or Sobibor, I forget. Messages\nlike, everything is wonderful and so on. They were made to write\nthese postcards just after arrival. The usual communication did\nget transmitted to the community there. Namely, a coded message\nto at least let people know things are really bad. Might have been\nsomething like Uncle Al went to visit Aunt Ethel yesterday and we\nexpect to visit her very soon ourselves and she is dead. That\nknowledge puts--the details I think in terms of gas chambers and so\non, were not known but... The next chapter was this; even though\nat that point things were relatively calm because there was a\ncessation of the transports. Here again, for some period of time,\nthose people who were left tried as much as possible to restore a\nnormal type of life, as much normal as possible. The big question\nmark was, things are just bound to get worse, particularly as the\nwar winds down, comes to its final stage and how will one get\nthrough that. For a while, a new idea sort of became popular in\nthe remaining Jewish community there. Namely, that at the very\nleast, what you need to do is to get your children to a boarding\nschool in Hungary, to Jewish boarding schools in Hungary. So that\nif things start being bad here, it will be much easier for parents\nthat are not encumbered by their children to make a quick escape\nthemselves out of Slovakia and join their children in Hungary. By\nthat time, you know, it was possible for money to obtain very good\npapers that gave you an legal Hungarian passport so that one could\nmake that trip legally. At some point, my parents got caught up in\nthe same idea and so at one point, my mother took my sister and me\nto a town, a city in Hungary, Mishgov (ph) (c.939) where there was\na Jewish boarding school in which there already were a number of\nthe kids from Michalovce that had been placed there. What I\nremember is again, I found the whole idea very exciting. I had\nread in books about boys in boarding schools and so on and so forth.\nSo when we got there, my mother did put me in this boarding school.\nWhat month and year is this, do you know?\nThis 1S about February of 1944. So she put me in this boarding\nschool and what I remember that immediately I felt tremendous\nhomesick then. I was very unhappy and very sad about looking ahead\nto having to stay there. Because of all this, I do remember trying\nto put a lot of pressure on my mother to change her mind. Precocious",

        "22\nmaturity, I talked to her about how we're going to be separated by\na border and this is war time and one never knows what's going to\nhappen and so on. So she ended up really feeling very conflicted\nabout the decision that she had made; to place me in that school.\nShe decided to delay really the whole thing with my sister. My\nSister needed a tonsillectomy so what she decided to do was to go\nto Budapest and have my sister have her tonsillectomy there. While\nmy sister was recuperating in Budapest, she was still very troubled\nabout her decision although one of her principal worries whether I\nmight be subject to bombing attacks because there were some\nimportant industries in M (c.969). Some people were talking\nabout possible bombing there. But she also--she was staying where\nthere was a Jewish concierge and she got to talking to him and he\ngave her another source of anxiety because he said, you think it's\ngoing to be all that safe here? My mother asked, what do you mean?\nHe said, I've seen a lot of German officers lately come here. I\ndon't know what's happening, what's going to happen. So there was\nanother source of concern for her. She got so worried about it\nthat she wrote my father in some coded way that she's thinking about\nchanging the plan. My father sent her a telegram saying act\naccording to our original decision. She was unwilling to take it\nupon herself to change that. But she was looking for someone who\nshe knew was in Budapest from our hometown, who was planning to go\nback very soon to Michalovce and wanted personally to let him know\nabout all her concerns so that he could talk to my father. She\nlooked all over Budapest for him, couldn't find him. On the last\nafternoon of this man's stay in Budapest, she happened to run into\nhim at a restaurant. Again, you know, pure chance. So she told\nhim all about it and how she would be terribly worried, etc. etc.\nand he got back, talked to my father. My father, at that point, I\nguess got so worried that if something did happen he would have to\nbear the brunt of that, so he wired my mother to bring me home. I\nremember that day very well. It was one of the happiest days of my\nlife up to that point. When I had sort of begun to resign to myself\nto staying where I really still didn't very much didn't want to\nstay. That the director of the school came to me one day and said,\nyou're going to Budapest and join your mother and arranged to have\nsomeone accompany me and take me to Budapest. I joined my mother,\ncame home. When he brought us home, people in Michalovce said,\ntold my mother, it was crazy, she was a totally, pathologically\nover-protective mother and how could she have done this. I remember\nrunning in to the father of one of the boys who was there in that\nschool, who when I was there told me how =me how very unhappy he",

I talked to his father,\nasked me about his son, I told him that he really was very unhappy,\nvery much wanted to come back and his father said, he doesn't know\nwhat's best for him. Well, as everyone knows, really within two or\nthree weeks, the big turnaround in Hungary took place. The Germans\ndid come in much more directly controlling the situation and the\ndeportation of the Jews from Hungary began. Are you out of tape?\nActually we're running out, yeah. We'll change it now.\nFive were accused from Budapest. In the provinces, you know, the\ndeportation of Jews was much, much--was really very, very extensive.\nMost of the people in the provinces didn't survive. This was in\nthe provinces. Mishalovce. So very quickly the school was seized\nby the local fascists and the Germans and most of the kids from\nthat school were sent directly to Auschwitz and killed, including\nthat boy whose father, you know, I talked to. And, of course, when\nthat happened, suddenly my mother had, you know, become--turned\nfrom a crazy woman into a great sage who had the foresight to make\nthe right decision. Then what--so that phase finished. Then later\non I guess in the beginning spring or maybe mid-spring of 1944, I\nremember I was at a soccer game--watching a soccer game with a\ncouple of friends of mine--when the sister of one of these friends\ncame and told us that we better go home. That they're going to be\ntaking the Jews again. I got home and my parents had already heard\nabout that too. This was not an official announcement. By this\ntime, the grapevine was pretty good so that a story like that got\nout before they intended it to get out. And so then the question\nbecame is what are we going to do and where are we going to hide?\nMy parents, I do remember that fairly clearly, talking and trying\nto think of all the possible alternatives and deciding finally to\napproach the president of the chamber of commerce. who had been so\nmuch = = in my father's behalf earlier. And so they approached him\nabout whether we could hide out on his property. He said okay. In\nfact, he had one or two other families that he had already arranged\nto hide. Now where did he hide us? Ina pigsty! Literally ina\npigsty on the grounds. And so we stayed there with rats all over\nthe place. We stayed there for two or three days and nights. By\nthat time, you know, my parents were getting word from this man\nthat he was getting nervous about this whole business and he wasn't\nsure how long he could keep us.

So for a while, it\nwas a question, do you believe him, do you trust him? Because\ntrickery had been---or do you trust the announcement? Was it set\nup so that people would come out of hiding? and then they would\ncatch them all. But they decided to come out and most people\ndecided to come out and it turned out to be true. This was an\ninstance where some of the top Jewish leadership did negotiate, you\nknow, about the situation. The reason they decided at that point\nto try and deport the Jews from that area was because the Russian\nfront was approaching. And so the unreliable Jews had to be gotten\nrid of. Also, this was a time when the transports from Hungary\nwere going through Slovakia to Auschwitz so it seemed like a\nconvenient time to hook up a few cars to those trains. But a deal\nwas made and it was true and everybody had to move to the western\npart of Slovakia except people who had certain exemptions even then.\nLike doctors and dentists, pharmacists; they could remain and be\nexempt. I mention that because in fact what happened was that\nlater on, those exemptions were no longer valid and most of those\npeople really did not survive. Because they were so isolated and\nhadn't learned--they'd been exempt all the way through really--and\nthey hadn't learned the art of surviving. So our family moved to\na town in western Slovakia which is called Neitra (ph) (c.51). The\nreason they chose that is because that's where my father's Gentile\npartner came from. That's where his family still lived and he\nwanted to go back there. So not only us then, but the partner, in\nfact, all the apprentices moved together with the shop. Because\ntheir training still depended on completing their apprenticeship.\nAnd so we all moved to Nitra (c.57). After a while, we got a place\nto live and this is an important part of the story. My parents\nfound a place to live in this kind of a complex, sort of a little\nhousing complex that had a--was walled off from the street with a\ngate through the wall. Inside there was a couple of yards. On one\nend of the yard, there was a detached, very small house which is\nwhere we lived. Across from the yard was a larger house, one\nsection of which, there was a big room where the four apprentices\nthat came with my father, lived. Adjoining them was where a railway\nconductor and his family lived and the apprentices arranged for\nboard by this railway conductor's wife. Around the corner and on\nthe other side of this railway conductor's family, was a machine\ntool shop. Now this was all within one enclosed complex. Now the\nwhole place was owned by a woman whose husband had been a communist",

        "25\nduring the first Czechoslovakian republic. And he was afraid of\npersecution for being a communist. So when they built this house,\nthey specifically built it with a hiding place that might be used\npotentially by him. The hiding place was a space within the\nstructure of the house that you could get into from the apprentices'\nroom. There was a kind of a closet that was set into the wall,\nreally more like an armoire or something like that, set into the\nwall. And you opened it up and it seemed to end where it ended in\nthe back but actually it was a false door that if you pushed it\naside, you got into this space which was the hiding place. Now in\nterms of size, I suppose I should use feet, maybe you can translate\nit. It was about as wide as from here to maybe the other side of\nyour chair that you are sitting on. That's as wide as it was. In\nterms of length, it was from say this wall down to about the end of\nthe rug there. So it was a relatively small space; it had no access\nto the outside. The walls were damp with moisture. At any rate--\nwhen we--when my parents got this place this woman who rented it\nout to them, who owned it, who didn't live there, told them about\nthis hiding place. Apparently, the railway conductor's family and\nhis family also knew about this hiding place. So then what happened\nwas this; after we had lived there for a little while, somebody\ncame and told my parents that they had heard one of the big shots\nin the local fascist guard, obviously drunk. He started yelling\nand screaming in the marketplace, about how the day will soon come\nwhen he will come to this whole complex and get all of the Jews and\ncommunists out. When my parents heard this story, they immediately\nrealized, they had to do something about this. You could not afford\nto have an important person like that out gunning for you. So my\nfather went to see him with his partner with the idea of somehow\nbuying his goodwill, with gifts or bribe. The man wouldn't hear\nanything of it. Apparently what was clear was that he had some\ngrudge against the woman who owned this place. He felt she had\ncheated him out some years before of something and he was still\nholding a bitter grudge against her. So when my father's partner\ncame back, my mother who was sort of canny in these ways said to my\nfather, that he ought to go back by himself. That the reason the\nman didn't take a bribe was that he didn't want a witness. So my\nfather did go back and my father was very charming and engaging and\nlistened to his complaints about this woman and said, oh yes, you're\nabsolutely right; and then offered him a couple of rings. By the\ntime my father left, you know, he was friendly as he could be,\ntowards my father. Now this is important because he appears again\nin the scene. The other thing that's important is this; and here",

        "26\nagain my mother was really a very determined survivor and what\nhappened was when we moved to western Slovakia, of course, all Jews\nwho had moved over there were required to register. There would be\na very severe penalty for those failing to register. Now my parents\nhad learned already from the previous experience that certainly the\npolice followed the registration lists when they went to pick up\nthe Jews. So my mother was determined that we were not going to\nregister period. But there was such a pressure from everybody, to\ngo along, not to cause trouble that one day there was this area\nwhere there was a Jewish soup kitchen and school and so and there's\nwhere the registration took place. There was--one day my mother\nsaw my father in line to register. And she made a big stink and he\nfinally stepped out of the line and we didn't register which\nprobably also helped. Because what happened was this; again this\nis part of history. There was the Slovak resistance suddenly\nerupted. The Germans marched in, came in, took a much more direct\nrole in the governing of the country. Also, came to fight off the\nresistance because suddenly the resistance was taking over a fairly\nbig chunk of territory but not the town where we were. But people\nknew things were going to get bad. Now the first day that my sister\nand I were supposed to start off in school, September of 1944, we\nwere late going to school. Suddenly my father comes back, having\nalready left to go to work, in panic. He had apparently stopped\noff at the barber. The barber started lathering his face and then\ntold him about the Jews--they're taking the Jews. My father said\ntake the soap, lather off. He came right back but if we hadn't\nheard about this police big shot being after us, he would have been\nthere six o'clock that morning to get us. If my father hadn't\nsucceeded in winning him over. If we had registered, they probably\nwould have been there fairly early too. In fact, they never came\nto pick us up officially because we were not on the registration\nlists. But when we--my father come back--what to do, where to go?\nFor some reason, I guess my parents really didn't quite trust--\nalthough this railway conductor, not long before, had told my\nfather, Henry, don't worry, if trouble comes, we'll hide you. I\nguess they didn't trust it because their decision was that we would\ngo to the house of my father's partner's parents. They had a house\non the other side of town, on the outskirts with some orchards and\nso on. Again, we broke up into three groups; my sister and I, my\nfather alone, my mother alone, to make the journey across the town.\nI do remember that, because everywhere you saw police cards. They\nwere picking up Jews everywhere. One time, it seemed to me at\nleast, like the policeman in the car looked at us for a while before",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "27]\nhe decided to go on. Finally we all got there and they put us,\nthese people, they agreed to hide us and they put usS in an open\nkind of shed in their orchard. That night was miserable, was cold\nand we kept hearing noise of people going--obviously being in the\nwoods and coming closer and closer and branches crackling. Finally\ntotally panicked by it, made them--these people take us inside. We\nheard later on that there had been thieves in the orchard all night\nand that's what we were hearing. We stayed there for a couple of\ndays, two or three days. Then these people said, we can't keep you\nanymore. We're afraid what will happen to us. We've got an idea\nfor you, a place to hide. We know of this place, in an attic,\nthere are 24 people, I'm sure they're take you too. Here again, my\nparents, particularly my mother response was, I'm not going there.\nIf you know about this place and you have no business knowing about\nthat hiding place, that place isn't going to be good for very long\nat all. In fact, it wasn't--within a week or two it was raided and\neverybody... Then my parents said, can we stay until dark? No, you\nhave to leave right away. So we made the trek back to our place\nagain in the three groups and again still police all over the place.\nWe got back and at that point, this was a Saturday afternoon, my\nparents did approach the railway conductor and said, look, we want\nto hide out in this hiding place. He and his family had to be\ninvolved because we had to be fed aside from the fact that he knew\nabout the place. So he said, no way. Was pleading back and forth\nbut he was adamant, no way. Then at some point, he goes off for a\nwalk with his seven-year-old daughter. This was one time, you\nknow, where I really did feel everything was lost. My parents just\nhad no idea what the hell to do. Waiting, at any time, for a knock\nto come on the gate. Suddenly we hear a knock on the door. Since\nthe gate hadn't opened, we were pretty sure, it wasn't the police\nand it was one of the apprentices. He told us why don't you come\ninto that hiding place, we'll hide you. So of course, we went.\nThen it became a matter as the other apprentices made their\nappearance of testing each one of them out to see how they felt\nabout it. They all agreed. Of course, they were all offered\ngenerous weekly subsidies while we were in there. Like making\nabout four times as much as they were at their jobs. Then the\nguestion was to approach the railway conductor's wife while he was\nout on his walk. Because without her being in on it, there was no\nway--that wasn't going to work either. She was offered a generous\ncompensation for it, probably much more money than her husband was\nmaking at the railway. Again, this was important. My father had\nthe shop all this time and able to make the money. I think they",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "28\nwere smart to offer the money in installments because at the same\ntime who asked people to hide them for all the money they had.\nPeople took the money and called the police. So then--but partly\nthey agreed, I think, partly they did feel for us and so on and\nthere was certainly some charitable feeling involved, but also at\nthat point there was still the sense of maybe it'll be all over,\nthat the partisans might actually win and the whole thing would be\nover after a couple of weeks. So we were there--we were in that\nhiding place without every budging from that place for two full\nmonths. We were mostly all lying down to be able to fit into that\nplace. The woman would bring us the food in a laundry basket and\nSo on. Of course, it wasn't kosher food, it was pretty good, I\nmust say and it was okay to eat it because you had to. Then, in\nterms of our elimination functions, we had a chamber pot and used\nthat all day. Then in the evening, one of the apprentices would\nget rid of the waste. So, as I say, for two full months, we didn't\nbudge out of there. Then I became sick with fever, with high fever.\nMy parents started worrying about that. I remember that very well\nbecause there was a lot of anxiety. I remember sweating like a pig\nat some point and thinking that meant I was really going to die. I\ndidn't know that meant my fever was breaking. That was after they\nhad sent one of the apprentices out to get some kind of anti-fever\nmedication. Because the fear was, you know, if you call ina\ndoctor, you couldn't be sure, he would turn you in. After that, my\nparents decided it was not very healthy to just stay in that place\nSo we moved over into the apprentices' room. A couple of them, I\nguess, moved somewhere else in the complex. A couple of them were\nstaying with us in that room with the idea that if necessary, in\ntime of crisis, we could run into the hiding. For the next period\nof time and now this was after--I mean the total time we were in\nthat hiding was nine months. But there was a period of time there\nwhere we would then particularly if the railway conductor,--and the\nfact that he was away most of the time--made it possible to maintain\nthis arrangement. But we kept hearing stories from the apprentices\nabout how this hiding place was exposed, these people were taken,\nthose people were taken. One never--every day that could happen\nwith us. At some point, one of the boys, in fact the boy who asked\nus to come in--there were stories coming up that pretty soon the\nGermans were going to conscript able-bodied Gentile Slovakians for\nlabor in Germany to help with the war effort. He certainly didn't\nwant that. So he wanted to be able to use the hiding place for\nhimself, if necessary, so he asked us to leave. At that point, my\nparents said to him, okay, George, we'll go but you know very well,",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "29\nthey're going to catch us very quickly. I'm sure they'll ask us\nwhere were you? We'll tell them. Aside, of course, from the\npossible punishment for hiding, which really never--it was always\nthreatened but I never heard of anybody who really got shot or\nanything like that for hiding Jews. But the hiding place was no\ngood. If the officials, knew, it wouldn't be any good for him so\nthere was no reason for him then to pay off in his asking. Fora\nwhile then, occasionally at night, we would actually go out in the\nyard for a walk. I remember for the first time, fresh air that I\nhadn't seen for months. But then, one day, the German army moved\ninto that complex. They took over the place where we had lived and\nthere was a leather shop, they made there. They took over the\nmachine tool shop and had some other kind of shop and the whole\nyard was patrolled by a German sentry all the time. There was no\nway, Obviously, that we could ever go out of that room. That room\nhad a kind of a porch between itself and the yard but you could\nsee, you know, through the window you could...\nWas there any light? That's what I was going to ask you.\nVery little light in that room. Certainly no light in the hiding\nplace,, at all other than from a candle, no electric lights. Then\nthere was a room which was relatively dark because there was, in\nfact, a porch, not a screened porch but a glass enclosed porch\nbeyond that. There was a little window between the room and the\nglass enclosed porch as well as, I think, some glass on the door.\nBut you could see through that window, you could see the German\nsentry out there. At one time, in the evening, you know, one of\nthe apprentices was on his way from the railway conductor's house\nfrom his meal back to his place. The German sentry said, halt and\nhe got panicked and he kept running towards the room where we were.\nFinally he stopped at the doorstep but he could have walked right\nin. Then what happened was that... Then the next crisis was the\nwoman who owned the place suddenly showed up and she found out we\nwere there and everything. She said she had to sell the place, she\nhad big debts and the only way she could get out of it that she had\nto sell the place. In fact, she did and the new owners were\nSupposed to take over the first of April of 1945. But then around\nNovember of '44, December, we began to hear the artillery, the\nRussian artillery. But really the front stalled for the winter\nabout 35 miles, 40 miles from where we were. And then one day, we\nheard sirens and planes all over the place and a big bombing attack\ntook place. Before that there had been air raids of American Flying",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "30\nFortresses that kept flying over to Weinernorstach (ph) (c.297) to\nbomb the armaments factories there. We had gotten used to the fact\nthat, you know, nothing every happened there. But this time, it\nwas different, low-flying planes and suddenly we're being bombed.\nThere was no basement we could go to, windows were all broken. But\nthat was the start of the Russian offensive, where the front had\nbeen stalled for all that time. Then the question was, at that\npoint, let's see what happened--we could no longer hide from the\nrailway conductor that we were around. Of course, with the war\nabout to be over, he had no more objections to our being there.\nBecause one of the things that propaganda, German propaganda was\nvery--would have you believe that when they came in, whatever Jews\nwere left would become kings. Anybody who had anything to do\nagainst them would be severely punished. I guess it was to keep\nthe motivation on their side because a lot of people were in some\nway implicated even though people had taken over Jewish property\nand so forth. By the way, at that point, everybody was looking to\nhave a good deed, you know, on their side because... So we were--\nso at some point particularly after the second night when the front\nStarted, there was shelling all night, you know, just big flares of\nlight, big explosions and there was no where to hide. So at some\npoint my parents decided to go and the other people--they were\nconnected with the other apprentices--went to the railway\nconductor's new house which had a basement which was about a mile\nOr so away. At some point, we decided to join. But when we got\nthere, we started hearing stories that the Germans were going to\ncome by and collect men again for work. But they would have found\nus there, that's no hiding place. So my parents decided that we\nhad to go back to the original place. By that point one of the\napprentices became the one that my parents really came very much to\ntrust and rely upon. He said wherever you go, I will go with you.\nHe came back with us and it was taking some chance because there\nwas a curfew. Just any patrol that had stopped us could have shot\nus just for having the curfew violation. Anyway, in another couple\nof days because of the heavy shelling and so on, and total lack of\nprotection there, we decided to go back again to the other place.\nFor the next two days, there was bombing and shelling and so on and\nfinally there was silence one morning. We looked out and there\nwere the Russian soldiers and the liberation of that town took place\non March 31. Remember the April first deadline?\nYeah, yeah.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "31\nJust as a little postscript--sort of presaging things to come. When\nwe were liberated that day and came out into the open, my parents\nfelt what if there is a counter attack and we were now out in the\nopen and Germans temporarily retake this place? So they wanted\nto find some way of moving further back behind the lines. Having\nbelieved all this German propaganda about how when the Russians\ncame in, they were so wonderful for the Jews, my father set out to\nthe Russian headguarters to find out if it is possible to be\ntransported back further behind the lines. He runs into a couple\nof Russian soldiers and asks them, where is the headquarters. They\nask him, who are you? why are you asking? My father says why I'm\nJewish, expecting then to be treated royally. One of the soldiers,\nthey were both pretty drunk, points his automatic gun at him and\nsays, you're Jewish, I'm going to kill you. He could easily have\ndone that the first day after, you know,... But his pal said let\nhim go. So my father no longer looked for the headquarters but\ncame back and we kept our fingers crossed. Of course, there was no\ncounter-offensive because this was really the beginning of the final\nvery quick retreat and defeat of the Germans.\nIt's a wild story.\nYes, it is a wild story.\nYou do have a couple of pictures of relatives. Are there any\nrelatives that you would like to talk about, that we could possibly\ninclude in our project, do you think?\nWell, there's only--I mean none of them--as I said, there's only\none survivor.\nI mean of the ones who perished. Would you know enough about any\nof them to discuss?\nWell, I can say little things about them. One cousin who did\nSurvive, his parents and sister both died. I do remember his\nparents, his father was a very good person. They had a pastry shop\nthat I used to go to and finagle little gifts of pastry. My aunt\nused to make ice cream every morning, the old-fashioned way. As I\nremember it to be the most delicious ice cream that I had ever had.\nMy cousin, their daughter, who was at that point about seventeen or\neighteen, whom I mentioned before, who had hid out during the---he\nwas very much wanted to survive and tried very hard not to be taken.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "32\nI don't remember the exact circumstances but she did get taken.\nThese relatives I mentioned before, my mother's younger sister whose\nwedding picture you saw, she was a very pretty woman. Their\ndaughter, I mentioned, I mentioned who was very, very cute--at one\npoint she and I played a fair amount together. She kept talking\nabout she wanted to marry me like little girls of that age would.\nWhat was her name?\nEva. Called her Evitcha. (c.402). Those were the relatives that\nI was closest to--perished.\nCertainly tragic.\nYeah.\nAre there any other incidents, or episodes, images which stand out\nin your mind from this period that you didn't discuss, that you\nmight want to include as part of the interview?\nI can't think of any right now.\nAlso, did you want to discuss a little bit about what happened to\nyour family after the war?\nYeah, I'll be glad to. The thing that--as soon as the war was\nover, of course, my parents once again wanted to come to America.\nSo that as soon as possible, we obtained an affidavit again through\nmy father's brother who was living in Minneapolis. Things were\nvery difficult there after the war. Very few Jews were left but\nanti-semitism was still very, very strong. There was little\nguestion in the minds of my family, anyway, that we wanted to get\nout of there as soon as possible. But again because of there still\nbeing that discriminatory, at that time, immigration law in the\nU.S. against Slavic eastern European country, we had to wait a long\ntime. By this time, I had begun going to a gymnasium, the public\nstate gymnasium where I was one of two Jewish boys out of about 40\nregular students. Our main teacher was clearly very anti-semitic.\nHe would have us take--he would have essentially this other Jewish\nboy and me take turns about being the scapegoat. There was to some\nextent true to some of the boys. I had one friend who I befriended,\na Gentile boy. When we had an argument, like boys will have, what\nhe had to say to me was that I always thought you were a different",

        "33\nJew but I guess you're like all the rest. This was after all of\nthis had happened.\nDid they have any Knowledge or sense of what ...?\nYeah, I think they did. One could occasionally hear from someone,\nthey didn't finish the job. My father began a jewelry shop again\nand actually that was quite successful for the next two or three\nyears. Then we were still there when the communists' coup d'etat\ntook place in February of 1948. Certainly there was a lot of\nanxiety--I did become, I must say also, quite active in the Zionist\nOrganization there. It was the Akiva that I belonged to. Attitude\nhad changed toward Zionism because of the experience of the war\nalthough when we finally left, I, having been a fervent Zionist at\nthat point really felt it was a betrayal to come to America rather\nthan to go to Palestine. My father didn't think Palestine would\nSurvive or that the Jewish community there would survive. Anyway,\nwithin a month or two after the communists took over, our number\ncame up. I don't know whether there was--whether the quota had\nbecome accelerated because of the communists takeover and this was\na few months before they clamped down on legal emigration from\nCzechoslovakia. So it was that window of opportunity and we\nessentially legally from Czechoslovakia, I think about April, '48.\nAnd the other thing--the post-war years, I remember for some, that\nwas after you survive yourself, people kept clinging to the hope\nthat their relatives would cone day come back. For many years,\nparticularly around holidays, there would be a lot of remembering\nand weeping about all lost.\nWell, if there isn't anything that you'd like to add, I want to\nthank you very much.\nYou're welcome.",
