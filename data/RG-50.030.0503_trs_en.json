        "A: I -- I was -- my whole life I was a big optimist.",
        "Q: Why do you think that\u2019s the case? Why were you an optimist?",
        "A: That\u2019s my nature.",
        "Q: So even as things got worse around you --",
        "A: I always had hope.",
        "Q: Now, what happens before -- what happened to cause your husband and you to decide to go\ninto hiding? Tell me about that -- that phase.",
        "A: Well, at that time, there came -- we were notified to come with a suitcase not heavier than so\nand so much kilogram, and with white ink, name written on the top, there and there, for\nrelocation. So we knew already what happened, and we were eni -- we were denying it. We did\nhave a place already, we knew already where to go.",
        "Q: When did you make arrangements for such a place?",
        "A: My husband made it.",
        "Q: And did that -- did he do that pretty early on after the anschluss?",
        "A: Aft -- no, after we heard that people were deported.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: It was a laundry.",
        "Q: This is where you went into hiding?",
        "A: Into hiding, yeah. It was a laundry in the 13\" district, in [indecipherable]. And there were\nwent.",
        "Q: And how did you or your husband know these people?",
        "A: Can\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And who were they? What are their names, and who were they?",
        "A: Their name was Pukas. She was not married, and they were hand laundries, you know. Yeah.\nI don\u2019t know how we met them, yeah.",
        "Q: So tell me about when you first moved into this hiding place, the transition from leaving your\nhome, and what did you bring with you?",
        "A: We went every day, we took a little bit out, you know, from the apartment. Clothes first, like I\nwould go to the cleaners, and then we started to take other things out, like silver, and so forth.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to take a quick break. Okay, we were starting to talk about you beginning to go into\nhiding, and I wanted to make sure I understood approximately when was this? How long after\nthe anschluss? Was it a year or two after, or -- or sooner than that? Do you -- did you go into\nhiding in 1938, or was it later?",
        "A: Later, later.",
        "Q: Think it may have been closer to 1941, does that seem right?",
        "A: I thinks that would be 1941, yeah.",
        "Q: So, from 1938 to 1941, were things getting more and more difficult all the time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And are there any examples that come to mind? What -- what sorts of things were happening?",
        "A: Life became very complicated for us, you know? Everybody know when you went to the\nstreet, you are a Jew, you know? And it was -- and we lost all our apartments, I told you that\nalready. We pushed together in small rooms. It was complicated, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you actively trying to leave the country?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I was supposed to go to Venezuela, I told you that.",
        "Q: But after that didn\u2019t work out, did you try other things?",
        "A: Then you couldn\u2019t go. We waited for papers who never came. You could leave if you have\nthe papers, but it never came.",
        "Q: And then at some point you started looking into the option of going into hiding.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And your husband was mostly in charge of looking for those arrangements?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, you already told me a little bit about receiving some kind of order, a relocation order.\nWhat did that say? What was the relocation order that you received?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t receive it. They started to -- people started to receive it. [indecipherable] my mother\ntoo, I told you, to come with so and so much for relocation, and they went to Theresienstadt.\nFrom there they came later to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: I thought you said you and your husband also received a relocation order.",
        "A: Then we went in hiding.",
        "Q: So when you received your -- the relocation order, what did it say? How long did it give you\nin order to relocate? Was it very short period of time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: I guess what I\u2019m curious to know is, did you have to go into hiding very quickly?",
        "A: I think so. But we already knew, and we were prepared to do it.",
        "Q: So does that mean you moved out of your apartment entirely?",
        "A: Yeah. We left, yeah.",
        "Q: So the first place you went into hiding in 1941, can you give a physical sort of description,\nwhatever your memory can recall.",
        "A: There\u2019s something. Wait a second. Yeah, Debbie\u2019s little brother, was his 13\" birthday.\nDebbie?\nA2: Yes? One second.",
        "A: Your little brother, what was his name? Ignatz.",
        "Q: Oh, I think --\nA2: Who, Ignatz?",
        "Q: I think yeah, you mean --\nA2: Ignatz.",
        "Q: -- her mother\u2019s brother. Well, actually -- so I want to -- I want to just --",
        "A: No, not her mother\u2019s brother. Debbie\u2019s little brother. Debbie?\nA2: Yes?",
        "A: You had a little brother.\nA2: I have a -- my brother is Howard.",
        "Q: Ah yeah, that\u2019s right. Her mother\u2019s brother, yeah. I-Ignatz. He was 13, and I said on that day,\nyou know, family should be together, so the grandparents they were in hiding already, and we\narranged they should come late in the evening while everybody goes home, and we will have a\nlittle celebration. And they never came, because they were arrested in the morning.",
        "Q: I think actually we -- we haven\u2019t talked about this yet during the interview. Maybe you can\nexplain wh-who are these family members, or who are these friends you are referring to. Can you\ntell me a little bit about your friends Ann and Ignatz?",
        "A: My friend Ann?",
        "Q: How did you meet them, or how long did you know them?",
        "A: Well, when I saw her first, she was 13 -- Ann Green? You speak about her?",
        "Q: Yes, because you started to talk about her brother, so I just wanted you to give a little\nintroduction to both of them.",
        "A: So when I saw her the first time, she was 13, and her father was what we call a person -- they\ncame from a small town to Vienna, they were relocated, and he could do everything. You want to\nsell, he knew who buys. You want to buy, he knew who will sell. So what we needed was\nmoney, and he knew somebody who would borrow money for a lot of interest. We couldn\u2019t get\nour money from some reason or the other. And there I met Annie the first time, Ann Green. And\nhis -- her little brother, yeah.",
        "Q: So when you first went into hiding with your husband, were you also in hiding with Ann and\nher brother?",
        "A: No. When I went to hiding -- I wonder if her brother went with us, I wish I could remember.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay. Can you --",
        "A: The 19\" of May.",
        "Q: What was the 19\" of May?",
        "A: Was his -- her brother\u2019s birthday.",
        "Q: And what happened on that day?",
        "A: I wanted a -- we should be all together, but her parents never came because they were arrested\nin the morning.",
        "Q: And did you know that? Did everybody know that?",
        "A: No, no, we did not know. They didn\u2019t show up. So later in the evening, somebody called, and\nsaid they are arrested.",
        "Q: And how did you deal with this news?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: How did you cope? How did you deal with this news?",
        "A: Well, was very hard. Her brother started to yell, and to cry. And I said, please be quiet,\nsomebody would -- could hear us. And Annie went to -- Ann Green, she went to calm him down.\nWas very bad. It was very bad.",
        "Q: And this is when -- his birthday, Ignatz\u2019s birthday, May 19, that\u2019s -- at that time you were all\nin hiding together?",
        "A: Not yet, no.",
        "Q: Were you already in hiding with your husband?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. We knew already. We were in hiding and Bushie was with us. Ignatz was -- was\nwith us. Annie came later. Mrs. Green, she was someplace else, she came later.",
        "Q: Tell me about the conditions of this hiding place. Did you have a lot of space, or a very little\nbit of space? What were the conditions like?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- was a [indecipherable] laundry, and they had a wooden, little house. Was small, but it\nhas electricity. It was a outhouse, you know, no toilet in the house. But it was all right, we\nmanaged. We were hiding it. We did feel a little bit secure, you know?",
        "Q: How many of you were in that outhouse?",
        "A: Outhouse, no, not outhouse.",
        "Q: In -- in the outhouse, you said.",
        "A: Outhouse was the toilet.",
        "Q: Sorry, in this little building, right?",
        "A: In the building. So who was there? My husband, I, and [indecipherable] then Annie came, we\nwere four.",
        "Q: Were you all sleeping in one room?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Could be, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And where did you go to the bathroom, it was close by?",
        "A: It was outside in the garden. We had to go outside.",
        "Q: And you said there was an outhouse, or you just went outside and went to the bathroom\noutdoors.",
        "A: That was the outhouse. The toilet was outside, a little shed where you had to go.",
        "Q: And what did you do for food back there?",
        "A: For food, well you had to get it. And we bought it. We had to take -- we knew somebody, she\ncould get everything. But if you needed sugar, you had to take some chickens, otherwise she\ndidn\u2019t give it to you. She was very funny. She always said, I\u2019m very good to you, am I? But she\nnever woulds give us anything, [indecipherable] anything if you wouldn\u2019t have taken something\nelse what you did not need. But she could get everything from the market.",
        "Q: And was this woman Jewish, or not Jewish?",
        "A: No, not Jewish.",
        "Q: So she was helping you, she knew that you were in hiding?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, she knew.",
        "Q: Were there a number of non-Jewish people helping you?",
        "A: Yeah, there were two girls, they had -- they had some land and they grow vegetable, th --\neverything. We got everything from them. And they knew. They didn't say it, but they knew.",
        "Q: They knew that you were in hiding?",
        "A: Yeah, I know. One of this -- one name was -- I remember one name, Fishbach. The second\nname I don\u2019t remember. They knew, because they did give us everything. Before they go to --\nwent with their vegetable to the market to sell, we got it.",
        "Q: So, you were able to get food. Do you remember being hungry while you were in hiding, or\nyou had enough food?",
        "A: No, no, enough food.",
        "Q: And did you have a kitchen, did you cook?",
        "A: No, I didn't cook. Pukas, she cooked.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about her, the person who was keeping you in hiding.",
        "A: Yeah, well, she had a boyfriend who was a carpenter. And he started -- and sh-she must have\ntold him, because he started to ask money. He -- he started to stick -- tell my husband that he\nneeds money to buy wood, you know? Yeah, he started to ask money for th -- us.",
        "Q: So what did you do?",
        "A: Well, we did give it to him, but he never stopped, and it was a lot of money, you know, for\nJewish people. He got the money for us if he will denounce us. And somehow he -- he must have\ndone it.",
        "Q: He must have done what?",
        "A: To denounce us. To tell that we are there.",
        "Q: You think he\u2019s the reason you were found?",
        "A: Yeah. I think so.",
        "Q: But the -- but the woman was very good to you?",
        "A: Yeah, we were -- but he did -- we had to from time to time to other place, which we did, you\nknow? And then she -- they called us back, and we came back, let\u2019s see, around five o\u2019clock,\nwhen everybody was in the street going home from work. Was five o\u2019clock in the evening. Four\no\u2019clock in the morning the Gestapo came, and we were arrested.",
        "Q: Now, before I ask you about -- about that time, I just want to try to capture more details while\nyou were actually still in hiding. Why -- why did you leave -- is her name Pukas -- Pukas? Why\ndid you leave, from time to time, from her hiding place?",
        "A: We had to, yeah. That was the arrangement.",
        "Q: She told you you would need to leave?",
        "A: That was the arrangement from the beginning.",
        "Q: So where else did you go when you would leave?",
        "A: To somebody -- people -- this was a couple, they were living in a completely different district,\nwe didn\u2019t know them. He was a tiny little man, [indecipherable] was his name, married to a\nJewish lady, and they took us in. We went to them.",
        "Q: Did you go to other hiding places as well?",
        "A: No, only those two.",
        "Q: Only those two, so this -- this one couple, or the woman who --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- had the laundry --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- business. So you spent most of the time at the woman\u2019s place, or with the couple?",
        "A: Yeah -- no, no, at the woman place.",
        "Q: Did you do any work while you were staying with her?",
        "A: Yeah, ironing. Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Now, tell me how you were feeling? Every day were you worried and afraid, or what was\nyour feeling at the time?",
        "A: We were always worried, but we had the children and we had school. They didn\u2019t know\nanything. They couldn\u2019t read, they couldn\u2019t write, they had no schooling at all. Every afternoon -\n- no, every evening -- 1n the afternoon we ironed, and in the evening we had school. They\nlearned to write, to read, whatever we could ba -- husband was very highly educated, and he is --\nwhatever we could, you know? We taught them, of course.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the two children who were with you.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. About Mrs. Green, and her little brother, yeah.",
        "Q: And how old were they? Well, he was 13 you said, and she was --",
        "A: And she was -- she 1s 15 years, she was born 1925. She was 15 years younger than I.",
        "Q: So every night you became a teacher?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So do you feel like during this time in hiding, were there also times where things were not as,\nyou know, heavy and worrisome? Did you have any lighter moments?",
        "A: No. We were worried all the time. You know, you -- you are not worried all the time, that\u2019s\nimpossible. You forget yourself. But w-we were not really peaceful, no. We were hopeful. That\u2019s\ndifferent. And we always made it, you know.",
        "Q: Were there any humorous stories while you were in hiding?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Two, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about those?",
        "A: Well, you know, when she wanted something, Pukas, we have to give it to her. She did not\nstop. So it was a holy day and she wanted a goose. And finally we got the goose, but we had to\npick it up by the [indecipherable] station. There was a stand for papers and cigarettes, and she\nhad the goose. And we had to go there, was very dangerous. Debbie\u2019s mother and I, we went\nthere, a-and there was the goose, I had the canvas bag, and the goose went in that canvas bag,\nand there were Gestapo and gendarmes, but we finally made it, and we left. And there was a dog\n[indecipherable] after that, he smelled the blood in that canvas bag, and we were running to the\nstreetcar, and we finally made it. You know, we were so afraid of that dog, that somebody will\nnotice it. That was very funny. When we came home, and Annie got undressed, she had a blue\nsweater. Her skin was all blue. Was not -- at that time, nothing was colorfast, like today.",
        "Q: At the time now you\u2019re -- you\u2019re laughing about it, but were you very worried at that time?",
        "A: Sure, I was worried.",
        "Q: You thought you might actually get caught that night.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: And it was just the two of you women? Or she was a girl and you were a young woman.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, she was a girl, yeah.",
        "Q: Just the two of you out on the streets?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How often did you go out like that?",
        "A: Oh, we went out when we had to do, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you worried -- were you wearing the Jewish Star of David at that time?",
        "A: No. Oh God.",
        "Q: So you were trying to pass as non-Jewish?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Did anyone ever talk to you and say anything to you, and indicate that they thought you were\nJewish?",
        "A: No. I knew that -- that one for the -- for the two girls, Fishbach, who -- who hads the -- that\ngarden that he had all that vegetable, and so she knew. She never said anything, but I am sure she\nknew.",
        "Q: Was there anything about your appearance that made it easier for you to pass in the streets as\nnon-Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah, I-I didn\u2019t look like Jewish. I was blonde, I have -- my hair was golden blonde, it was\nvery light. No, I didn\u2019t look like Jewish, no.",
        "Q: And what about your friend, Ann?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t look Jewish either.",
        "Q: So do you think this was very helpful in allowing you to go 1n the streets?",
        "A: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm,\nconducted by Amy Rubin on November 18, 2005, in Manhattan, New York. This is tape number\ntwo, side A. Okay, I\u2019m going to continue asking you a little more about your time in hiding. And\nI\u2019m wondering, during this entire time, I have the impression that you first went into hiding in\n1941?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And -- and you were s -- you stayed in hiding until 1944. So a lot was happening during this\ntime, and I\u2019m wondering what did you know about the war, and what was going on.",
        "A: We knew everything. We listened to the British sender at night, I told you. We do -- we knew\nthat attentat which, you know, there was supposed to be attentat of Hitler? You know that?",
        "Q: Say that again? There was supposed to be?",
        "A: Yeah, attentat? He was supposed to be killed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that -- somehow we knew that will happen, but it did not.",
        "Q: So while -- I -- I knew that you were listening to the radio before you went into hiding, but\neven while you were in hiding, you still listened?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And was that -- you listened right in that little building?",
        "A: Yeah. We had the radio, yeah.",
        "Q: So what were your conversations mostly about while you were in hiding? Did you talk\nprimarily about the war?",
        "A: That I should remember. Of course. We spoke about the war, we spoke about what happened,\nhow we did live. We spoke about what will happen. Then we had the children, who didn\u2019t learn\nanything, so we had school every day.",
        "Q: Did you feel like you were becoming a -- a sort of mother to these children? You were taking\ncare of them.",
        "A: Well, I f -- I did feel very near to them. They boy was very young, you know, of course, and\nAnnie was 15 years younger than I, so -- so Annie, I were more a friend than a mother. But to her\nlittle brother, I did feel like a mother, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk about sort of strategies about how you were trying to survive this entire\ntime? You know, walking out on the streets, did you have strategies where you would go, how\nyou would walk?",
        "A: I only noticed one thing. When I was liberated by the Russians, you know that -- you know I\nwas liberated by the Russians?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That I c -- noticed that I was afraid to go on the walk part. I was going on the street, til I said\nto myself, are you crazy, you\u2019re free. You know?",
        "Q: Are you saying you didn\u2019t want to walk on the sidewalk?",
        "A: Yeah, I was afraid, like I\u2019m not allowed to.",
        "Q: Because that\u2019s how it was in Vienna?",
        "A: That how I did feel.",
        "Q: So as you walked around Vienna, when you would come out of hiding from time to time, how\ndid the city feel to you? What were the differences? How did it change?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t feel -- I wasn\u2019t tired of being in Vienna. I was in Krakow, in Poland.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking about while you were in hiding. Weren\u2019t you s -- in Vienna the entire time?",
        "A: Yeah, I was in -- always inside [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So how did the city change during those war years? Did it feel like a different city to you?",
        "A: No. In later years, when I was living in Italy, and I came back to Vienna, everything looked to\nme so dirty, so broken down. That was later on.",
        "Q: Well, what about air raids during the war? Did you experience those in Vienna?",
        "A: When the air raid we -- well, when we were hiding by those people [indecipherable] when the\nair raid came, everybody had to go to the basement. And their apartment was in the fifth floor,\nand we went up to the attic to hide. And there, Bushie, he was afraid of the little mice. Oh God,\nhe -- yeah, we did hid in the attic til the air raid was over.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re saying there were mice in the attic?",
        "A: Yeah, there were mice, yeah. And Bushie was so afraid of them, terrible.",
        "Q: Were you afraid too?",
        "A: No. Of little mice? I don\u2019t want them in my apartment.",
        "Q: Now, I think I heard another story, and I\u2019m not sure exactly the details, but something about a\nman and the bathtub, the water in the bathtub. Is that a story that you remember while you were\nin hiding? I think 1t was a man who drank the water.",
        "A: That\u2019s not me.",
        "Q: Okay, I -- I guess I misunderstood something I think Deborah was telling me, but maybe I just\ngot it wrong. So that doesn\u2019t sound familiar to you?",
        "A: Absolutely not.",
        "Q: Did you have any other people who came and joined you during hiding, or was only the four\nof you at all times?",
        "A: Only the four of us.",
        "Q: And did you feel like you always trusted this woman who was keeping you in hiding?",

        "Q: And they were allowed to sing? Nobody was keeping them from doing that?",
        "A: I suppose not.",

I run after them, and there was\nso much water in the washrooms, flowing, you know? Then I woke up every night, we went\nthere, and we washed each other\u2019s back from top to bottom. We had no towel to dry, I said it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. Because if you had the selections, one pimple on your body, you went. We were\nafraid, you know, of sicknesses. We were a very cheap labor force, didn\u2019t cost a penny.",
        "Q: So it sounds like you tried very hard to stay clean all the time.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I knew that if -- if you are clean, you had a chance. I told her that, yeah. She had --\nshe showed me in the panties she got, there was a -- a -- a louse.

        "Q: What kind of work were you doing?",
        "A: Well, first -- that first work I did, stones like that we have to clean, and from one place we did\nbring it to a other place. And there were the bloodhounds behind us, we have to run with the\nheavy stones, then we have to take the back. It was just something to make us tired, nothing else.\nThere was n-n-no -- nothing what has any sense. And then I -- then we made [indecipherable] to\nclean the pavement. And then I did something, I was standing in water, I don\u2019t remember what I\ndid.",

Okay, I think there are a couple stories while you\nwere in Auschwitz that I\u2019d be interested in learning more about. I think there\u2019s a story that has\nsomething to do with potatoes. Can you tell me more about that?",
        "A: Yeah. What happened is, when we get o -- got our soup in the evening, I said to that person\nwho did give the soup, why don\u2019t you give me some soup from the bottom, where there are\npotatoes, a little vegetable, maybe a piece of meat. And she said to me s-something very bad, and\nthens give me from top a little water, so I threw it in her face. So next day was the day when you\nwent to work, you got instead one potatoes, two potatoes. So he said, you are not going to work,\nI will show you. So I didn\u2019t go to work. But somebody has to go to pick up the potatoes. So they\ndid send four girls from our block to go to pick up the potatoes. So we heard potatoes, we went\nto the ba -- big, beautiful potatoes, we did [indecipherable] I took the potatoes, one there, one\nthere, and here. Four potatoes already. And then we came to my block, and we had to put that\ndown, had two potatoes, put them under my mattress, under the mattress from my neighbor, and\nthen we stood appelle and then [indecipherable] then I have potatoes, and we had so much\npotatoes, we ate and ate and ate.

        "Q: Inside your blouse -- inside your shirt.",
        "A: Yeah, and then the others I put under my mattress.",
        "Q: So were you not as hungry during those days with the potatoes?",
        "A: No, that was a day where I was very happy, yeah. I had potatoes not only for me, for my\nfriends, too. Who could eat so many potatoes?",
        "Q: When you were working, were you working side by side with your friend, Ann?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She was somewhere else?",
        "A: She was someplace else.",
        "Q: Now, there\u2019s another story, I think, about one of your socks. You had something special in\none of your socks?",
        "A: Yeah, I g -- we got once a month different clothes. We went to [indecipherable] we got\ndifferent clothes. And I have two pair of socks. The hurt -- one sock hurt me terribly, but I\ncouldn\u2019t help it, I had to wear it til Sunday, til I\u2019m off, Sunday afternoon. Then I open it, and\nthere was a golden cross with a golden chain. And it says, Luigi and the name, Italian name,\nAugust the 26\". Now I have to find somebody where I could exchange that golden cross for\nfood. Finally I did find, was far away, I had to run there, I got 20 soups, 20 days I could go for\nsoup. But it was very far. Had to run like crazy to make the curfew.",
        "Q: What was the curfew, what time? Was it early, pretty early?",
        "A: Yeah, it was early, yeah.",

        "Q: It sounds like you were pretty resourceful during this difficult time. Do you feel that you\nwere?",
        "A: Well, I tried. We all tried to survive.",
        "Q: Do you think being resourceful like that you were able to eat more and stay stronger?",
        "A: To eat more?",
        "Q: It sounds like you were able to get more food at certain times, and maybe that kept you\nstronger.",
        "A: Well, I only know when I was liberated, I had 90 pounds.",
        "Q: And how much did you usually weigh?",
        "A: At that time, 135 - 136.",
        "Q: So you were extremely weak?",

        "Q: Now did you -- did you observe any -- any sort of religious observances during this time in\nAuschwitz, privately, or did you pray at all?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Did you regard yourself as a religious person?",
        "A: Well, if you -- you could feel religious without praying, I suppose. Don\u2019t you think so?",
        "Q: Yes, I think so. Did you feel that you had a belief in God during this time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that I said God will help. Help yourself.",
        "Q: Did you ever let your emotions really get to you during this time in Auschwitz, or did you just\ntry to stay so strong emotionally?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I tried, yeah. It was Yom Kippur, and they said, now you have the holiday, you\ndon\u2019t have -- you don\u2019t need any food today, it\u2019s your fast day. Didn\u2019t give us anything to eat,\nYom Kippur.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t have to work that day, or did they make you work?",
        "A: Why not? Is nothing to -- they only didn\u2019t give us any food, because 1s our fast day.",
        "Q: But you still had to work?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Did you have any nightmares during this time? Was it just every night, how did you sleep?",

        "A: To stay in appelle.",
        "Q: Were you scared about being selected and taken away?",
        "A: Well, that was something else. This was not the roll call, this was the selection. You were\nafraid to have a pimple on your body, because they were afraid of sicknesses. So if you had a\npimple on your body, then you are dead already.",
        "Q: Did you see a lot of people being selected?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Did you ever witness anything very violent, any -- any killings while you were there?",

        "Q: Did you think a lot about the possibility of death during this time, or did you try to avoid\nthose thoughts?",
        "A: I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Did you try to avoid thoughts about death, or did you think about death?",
        "A: No. I tried to survive. I didn\u2019t think about death, no. Only that water you know, when we\ncame from work, they said not to drink, dysentery of the water, you know, in the washrooms. So\nI said to myself, I will die anyway, why should I die hungry? I will have -- at least I will have\nsomething to drink. I drank the water, nothing happened to me, I didn\u2019t get dysentery, nothing.\nSo I came from work and I drank.",
        "Q: Did others do that as well, or were you one of the only ones?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you that. I know I did it.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you make other friends while you were in Auschwitz?",

        "Q: So even in the midst of everything going on, you are able to read things like poetry\nsometimes?",
        "A: Not to read. Only -- I had a friend, whatever we knew, we s -- told each other.",
        "Q: Did that help you to feel more human again, you think?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: And how often were you able to do things like that?",

And there I met\nsomebody, and she said to me, I di -- no, there was a -- a girl, and she said to me, you have a\nsister. I said yeah. Well, I know, Ernesta Cohen.

        "A: What? When we were liberated, I had a friend in the concentration camp, and she had a\ndaughter, and she was very ill. And her daughter came to me and said, my mother wants to speak\nwith you. And she was laying on the floor, and she s -- was dying. And she said to me, promise\nme that you take care of Ilse, of her daughter, a young girl, she was maybe 12 years old, and her\nname was Freedbig. She died, and I closed her eyes. I promised I\u2019d take her with me. So she was\ncrying all the time. I couldn\u2019t help myself. There was a little church, and I said to her, \u201cIlse, I\ntake you to the church.\u201d She was Catholic. She never knew she\u2019s Jewish. So I took her there, and\nthere was a little priest -- a little -- a young priest, and s -- he consoled her, and he prayed with\nher. He did give her a piece of sugar, and me a piece of sugar, and said thank you for bringing\nher. And that was the Pope, later.",

One day her\nfather came, and she didn't want him. He had a short leg. I don\u2019t want him. He was in the camp,\ntoo. But something happened to one of his legs. She didn\u2019t go over to her father. I said to her,\nyou know, don\u2019t worry. I bring her home.",
        "Q: Now, I have just a couple more questions about your time in Auschwitz. Often I\u2019ve heard that\n-- that survivors remember certain smells or noises that for the rest of their lives, there are certain\nthings that are very vivid in this way, and I was wondering, have there ever been any certain\nnoises or smells that remind you?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: There was.",
        "Q: Now, did you know at the time that that was Mengele or did you learn later?",
        "A: Can\u2019t tell you that. We called him the angel of death.",
        "Q: Did you continue to encounter him while you were at Auschwitz, or only that one time?",
        "A: Only that one time.",
        "Q: So now, the day of liberation, can you tell me exactly what happened, and were you expecting\nanything like this? Did you know what was about to happen?",
        "A: No. We knew something happened, because we had -- had the bomb -- bombardment and the\nsirens, yeah. Woke up from running, the gates were open, oh yeah.",
        "Q: So what happened that day? Exactly wh-what was it like for you?",
        "A: I was very sick. I was in the revere. I had some inflammation my left -- my right leg. I had\nvery high temperature. But I know there was a girl standing on a bicycle looking in. And one of\nour liberated girls came out, threw her off the bike, took the bike and run. Took her bike, yeah.",

        "A: Something, yeah.",
        "Q: How did the -- how did the Russians treat you?",
        "A: The Russians? Well, they had nothing to eat, only potatoes and kraut. And that one doctor\nwas a Jew, he spoke Jewish. And I told him, how could you give us kraut? Potatoes all right, but\nwe can\u2019t eat sauerkraut. He said, we have a saying, whoever is strong will live, and who is weak\nwill die. And then they came and wanted to take us to Russia. And then took -- there were three\nsisters, they told me, we are going away, because we are afraid of being taken to Russia. You\ncome with us? I said yes. They spoke Polish, and German, and maybe Russian, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd we left. We went over the Carpath -- over the mountains, oh God.",
        "Q: Was that a difficult journey?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: They ran away.",

        "Q: Well, tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, at that time, you know, in the morning, everybody run to get some food, or coal,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t get anything. So we children were by ourself at home, and we were not\nallowed to open the door to anybody. But we had a little window, with a little [indecipherable]\nand somebody was ringing the bell, so we went up, opened it to look out, there was a man. He\nlooked like a forester. And he said, \u201cMarianne, open the door, I am your father.\u201d And I looked at\nhim, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d But I am your father, don\u2019t you know? Then I said to my b-\nbrother Paul, he is the -- he was the oldest, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s a man, he says he\u2019s our father.\u201d He went up,\nhe looked at him, we don\u2019t know you. Open the door. We didn\u2019t open the door. We didn\u2019t let\nhim in. Then finally my mother came, and then of course, there were only happiness. They were\ndancing and kissing outside, yeah.

        "A: No, no. I didn't see him for years. I didn\u2019t recognize him. But my brother recognized him\nbecause he laughed and he had the golden tooth. And my brother saw that golden tooth. And he\nsaid to me, \u201cIt\u2019s our father.\u201d How do you know? He has a golden tooth. But he didn\u2019t let him in,\nbecause Mother did forbid it.",
        "Q: Now there\u2019s another little anecdote I wanted to ask you about, and it --",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah? Well, there was a [indecipherable] coming in from -- I don\u2019t know from where. It was\na Jewish theater, and my parents went and saw it. The Golem was the name. And they decided\nthat we children are big enough to see it. So -- not my sister, my little sister, no. My brother who\nwas older than I, and myself and two cousins of us. And they took a loge for us children and our\nmaid did bring us there. And we were sitting there, and then it started and somebody came out\nand said, in Jewish, which were -- we were not used to, we never spoke it. He said -- I\u2019Il have to\ntranslate it, so y-you don\u2019t know Jewish, yeah?",
        "Q: Well, why don\u2019t you say it first in Yiddish, and then you can translate it.",
        "A: Yeah. [speaks Yiddish here] So that means, big Jewish king, we are coming to tell you and to\nlet you know -- and when they started to tell you and to let you know, we started to laugh\nterribly. So next moment they took us out one after the other, and we had to stay outside, and\nwait til our maid came to pick us up. When the the -- theater was over, they just threw us out.",
        "Q: They threw you out of the theater?",
        "A: Of the theater, yeah. One after the other. Took us under their arm, out.",
        "Q: But why, why did they do that?",
        "A: Because we started laughing.",
        "Q: So these are some of the fond memories you have from Vienna?",
        "A: Yeah. Not only, you know, from childhood I have other memories, too. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What about the anecdote about Mother\u2019s day?",
        "A: Oh poor Mother, we didn\u2019t let her go out of bed. How do you know about it?",
        "Q: Well these are some of the stories that Mazie encouraged me to ask you.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Yeah, well it was Mother\u2019s day, so we ha -- didn\u2019t have money, we were children,\nbut in the -- before Mother\u2019s day, my sister and I, we did [indecipherable] and my brother picked\nfrom the tree, flowers. Lilac. And s -- then was Mother\u2019s day and we made breakfast, and we\ndidn\u2019t let her go out of bed. And she had to go out so urgent, which is normal, but we didn\u2019t let\nher. She had to stay in bed and have breakfast which we made, in bed. That was the Mother\u2019s\nday story.",
        "Q: Did she enjoy it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, she had to go pee. Very urgent. We didn\u2019t let her.",
        "Q: Well, it sounds like you had a lot of good fun and good memories in your home.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, well, I really do, yeah. It was a fo -- but I was a orphan at a very young age,\nyou know.",
        "Q: There\u2019s another story, I believe about your mother, a humorous story, something about don\u2019t\ngive her away\u201d?",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. My father passed away, you know, and I was in the street. And I was\nwalking, and I saw a man from the back. He was dressed exactly like my father. Blue jacket up\nto here with the fur collar, funny little hat. And I started to run, and then I remember that he is\ndead. And I stopped and started to cry terribly. And a lady came, and said to me, \u201cChild, why are\nyou crying so much?\u201d And I said, \u201cMy father is dead, my father is dead,\u201d and started terrible\ncrying. So she said, \u201cOkay, where do you live? Come on, Ill take you home.\u201d She took me home\nand sh -- then she told my mother she wants me to come to Italy, she was a Italian. She has two\nlittle boys and they will be very happy to have a little sister. And my mother could take with me\nthere to see if she likes it. If she doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s all right. We have horses, she will learn to\nride. My boys will be -- adore her. And m-my brother and my sister started to yell, \u201cMother,\nplease, don\u2019t give her away, don\u2019t give her away.\u201d So that\u2019s the story from Italy.",
        "Q: Were you interested in going?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you that. If I would have gone, or if I was interested. I wouldn\u2019t even remember.\nBut I remember the sto -- like they started to yell that they shouldn\u2019t give me -- my mother\nshouldn\u2019t give me away. Don\u2019t give her away.",
        "Q: Now, what about another anecdote about when your mother was sick, and you had to cook?",
        "A: Oh God. My mother became ill, and had to lay down. She has a gall bladder attack. And she\nsaid to me, Marianne, you have to finish -- we ate lunch, the big meal, you know? Then the water\ncooks, then you put the -- I forgot her -- the -- in English, whatever it is in the boiling water. So\nthen I took a spoon with water, and I came into her bedroom and ask her if that water is cooking.\nI never knew because I never cooked. I never knew how it looks when water cooks.",
        "Q: How old were you? Were you very young?",
        "A: I must have been very young, and I can\u2019t remember where -- where our maid was, yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your maid, were you close to her?",
        "A: Very close. We adored her, we were fa -- we were not afraid of our parents, oh no, we were\nafraid of her. She was -- oh God. When we came in and our shoes were not clean, we got it. She\nhad a [indecipherable] she just went over our legs, oh yeah. And we adored her. And we were\nafraid of her, yeah, but we loved her yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Marie.",
        "Q: And she stayed with you for a long time?",
        "A: Oh, a very long time. My mother got her when she got married. She stayed with us for a very\nlong time, and then she met somebody someplace, a landowner, very, very wealthy, and they got\nmarried. And we spend the summer with her, because she c-came and asked my mother, please\nsend the children. And we sp -- did spend the whole summer with them, yeah.",
        "Q: So your family was pretty well off financially, to have a maid?",
        "A: Yeah, in the beginning, sure. As long as my father was alive, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, I believe there\u2019s another story here. Maybe you already told me the one about boiling\nthe water, but what about baking the chicken?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Baking the chicken. Mazie said there was a story you wanted to share about baking chicken,\nno?",
        "A: Baking chicken?",
        "Q: I think when you had to cook for your mother? You don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. And what about another -- this is the final anecdote I wanted to ask you about. Your\nfirst doll, and your brother did something with it.",
        "A: Yeah, they opened her head. I had had a beautiful doll. When you pushed her belly button,\nshe said Mama, and when you laid her down she closes her eyes. And it was a big doll like that.\nAnd my brother and my cousins couldn't understand why she closes her eyes, so they opened her\nhead, yeah. And that poor doll, she had to go to the hospital. Yeah, she was very sick. It was\nterrible.",
        "Q: You took her to the doll hospital?",
        "A: Not me. Not me, no, my parents, my mother and my father, whoever did take her to a place to\nbe repaired. They cut the head open.",
        "Q: Were you very upset, as a child?",
        "A: I cou -- oh [indecipherable] I cried. Of course I was upset. It was a beautiful doll, she would\ns-say Mama. She spoke, yeah. At that time, you know, I got it for -- my father did bring it from I\ndon\u2019t know where. It was a beautiful, beautiful doll. Had hair, everything, yeah.",
        "Q: And it was probably unusual to have a doll that spoke at that time.",
        "A: Yeah sure. She only said Mama, but she said Mama. But you have to push her belly button.",
        "Q: Well, thank you for sharing those stories. Now, I want to ask you some more questions that I\nhad here, prepared. And I wanted to make sure because I -- I don\u2019t remember from our first\nsession together, can you just make sure to tell me your husband\u2019s name?",
        "A: Seno.",
        "Q: Ah well, I know you were married twice --",
        "A: That\u2019s my [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- but your first husband.",
        "A: Yeah, my first husband was Otto Brower.",
        "Q: And so that became your last name for awhile as well?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, I wanted to return where we left off in our interview. We were talk -- we were starting\nto talk about the time of liberation at Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But I wanted to make sure that I had a -- some information even before we got to that point. I\ndon\u2019t know if you know this by heart, or if we could somehow put this in the interview, but do\nyou know the -- the registration number, the tattoo number that they gave to you?",
        "A: Well, you know, I -- I know 60 - 65 - 85 A -- I think so.",
        "Q: Okay, it looks like A7 -- it\u2019s hard to read, but maybe another two.",
        "A: 75 -- 72?",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s 72, and then maybe a 25.",
        "A: 72 - 25.",
        "Q: Does that sound --",
        "A: That sounds --",
        "Q: -- familiar?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So it looks like A7225.",
        "A: I forgot it, I tell you.",
        "Q: Is that a good thing, to forget the number?",
        "A: Yeah, I forgot it completely.",
        "Q: Well, thank you for showing me. Now, when you were in Auschwitz, did you and others\naround you, did you ever have any kind of religious observance? Did you try in any way to -- to\nobserve --",
        "A: No, no. Only to Yom Kippur, they didn\u2019t give us any food. They said that this here the day\nwhere you fast anyways, you don\u2019t -- so you don\u2019t need any food.",
        "Q: And that must have been very difficult in the conditions you were in. Now -- now tell me\nmore about liberation. If you can sort of walk me through that time period, what you remember,\nand sort of set up the scene for me, what -- what exactly happened?",
        "A: I was sick. I was very sick. I had a mer -- an infection in my right leg, and I have very high\ntemperature, and it was very dangerous to go to the revere. That revere was the s-s-sick station,\nwhere sick people went, because they made selections there, you know, and killed people. But I\nhad no other choice. I was very, very ill. And it happened that I was absent mind, I know that.\nAnd then, I remember only that 1t was raining and I did feel the drops from the rain on my face.\nAnd I opened the eyes, and there I saw a man with the sickle and the hammer, was a Russian\nsoldier. He held me in his arms, and it wasn\u2019t raining, he was crying terribly. That when we -- I\nwas -- when we were liberated. And the gates were open, people went out, you know.",
        "Q: What was the next thing that you did?",
        "A: Next thing? I was there for a long time. I actually couldn\u2019t go. Then finally I became well\nenough. And there were three sisters. They spoke German and Polish and Russian. And they\nsaids to that -- no, there came a rus -- Russian man, and they said they will take us to Russia to --\nto get well again. And there were three sisters, they told me, we are not going with them. You\nwant to come with us? We are going home. They were from Seidenbergen, well a -- this a tar --\npart of Europe. And so I went with them, and we went over the mountains, oh it was terrible. It\nwas March, was snowing, cold, but we went, oh yeah. Took us days and days, til we came\nsomeplace, and that was dangerous. We slept on the street, like where the -- you know, the --\nwhere the bus station is, there was little houses where I could stay and wait for the bus. And\nthere a man did find us, and he said, \u201cAre you crazy? They are looking for Jewish people. If they\nfind you, they kill you.\u201d And he took us to a place where we were safe, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you travel over those snowy areas, the mountains?",
        "A: By foot. Later on by coal [indecipherable] the tickets, were train with coal, so we were sitting\non the coal, and went with the train. You could go wherever you want. You didn\u2019t need any\npassport, any nothing at that time.",
        "Q: First of all, at the time of liberation, what was your feeling, what were your emotions? Was it\nhard to believe that this was happening?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Was it hard to believe that liberation was really happening when it happened? What were\nyour emotions at the time?",
        "A: Well, I was relieved, I would say. I was happy. And I couldn\u2019t wait to come home, but it took\na long time, because the war was still going on. We were already liberated, but the war was still\ngoing on. There was a time, finally when I came home. Oh God, took a long time.",
        "Q: Tell me about the rest of the journey, how you got back home.",
        "A: Well, you could take a train, you didn\u2019t have to pay, you know, I told you that. I was sitting\nfor days on the train with coal, that I remember. It was bitter cold, yeah. It was very, very cold.\nAnd finally, finally, I came home. And when I came home, it was night, and I was on the train,\nand they took us right away, whoever was in the train, they took us to a place that was a cellar in\na building. And there they did give us some to eat or drink. I wasn\u2019t by myself, there were maybe\nwith me, 12 or 14 other people. And they did give us some tea, not made from tea, from\nsomething else.

        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think it\u2019s largely because of that friendship that you were able to make it through?",

But ha -- later they did find them. I came home without the chicken.\nYou asked me that, right?",
        "Q: So what happened when you got home?",
        "A: When I get [indecipherable] home, where are the chickens? I said I throw them away. I was\nafraid they were still alive. So did you know, at that time, nobody took anything. Was different\ntimes.",
        "Q: Did you get in trouble?",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- I think -- not that many questions left to ask you, but a few. And I\u2019m wondering, was it\ndifficult for you to adjust to normal life after the war, after the Holocaust?",
        "A: Yeah. Was difficult, yeah. Was difficult, yeah.",
        "Q: In what ways?",
        "A: In every way. You know, I told you, I did find myself walking on the street -- I was afraid to\ngo on the boardwalk, you know? And took a long time to come back to a normal life. When I\nstarted working, that did help me a lot. I was busy, and you know, I had very little time to think\nabout myself. I was tired, I started to sleep good, yeah.",
        "Q: How do you think -- how do you think your experiences during the Holocaust affected --\naffected you afterwards, affected you later, decisions you made in your life --",
        "A: Well, what should I tell you? I tried to live a normal life. I was happily married, I told you\nthat. I lost my husband, I was very unhappy. I had a boyfriend later, I was very happy again. And\nthen, when he passed away, I said, I don\u2019t want to cry after men any more in my life. Now I will\nstay by myself. I lost a lots of people I loved dearly, and that what it 1s.",
        "Q: Are there certain things about -- about your experiences during the war, during the Holocaust\nthat -- that really directly affected things that you did later -- later in your life? Decisions that you\nmade, life choices? Do you see the Holocaust as having affected those decisions?",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMarianne Windholm. This is tape number four, side A. If you could just continue with what you\nwere telling me.",
        "A: What did I tell you? Yeah, of course the biggest shock for me was to lose my eyesight. But I\nam a very lucky in one respect. I have good people around me whom I love, and they are good to\nme, and I am good to them. So I tried to keep a normal life, that is it. I watch television -- I watch\n-- I listen to radio, I listen to television, and of course, my life 1s different than from a normal\nperson, but I have to cope with it. There\u2019s nothing what I could do.",

        "Q: Do you think the Holocaust had any effect on your thoughts about religion?",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Have you ever given thought to the question of -- of God and the Holocaust, if there\u2019s -- if\nthere\u2019s a God, how could the Holocaust have happened?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not the first time. There was the Spanish Inquisition, there was a English\nInquisition, as far as I remember, I don\u2019t know. I am correct, I suppose. And this 1s not the first\ntime that happened. We are still, after the Chinese, the oldest people on earth. The Chinese are\nolder than we are.",
        "Q: Even though you -- you did not observe the religion, did you stay very connected in your\nidentity, to Judaism?",
        "A: Well, I never say I\u2019m not a Jew. That what I say [indecipherable] now. Some of the\n[indecipherable] me in the building for Easter and ask me, are that your holidays or ours? So I\nsaid, \u201cYou want to know if I am Jewish? I am.\u201d",

        "Q: And when did you start talking more about your experiences during the war? When did you\nstart to do that?",
        "A: I never talked about it. With whom?",
        "Q: Like with Debbie, or with, you know, any of the people you\u2019re close to.",
        "A: Normally I only start to tell them what is funny. Funny stories, yes, nothing else.",
        "Q: Do you think it\u2019s unusual that -- that you\u2019re able to -- to capture those funny moments? Do\nyou think a lot of people would not remember the funny moments?",
        "A: How could I know what other people do? I never speak with them.",
        "Q: But it does seem like the humor is very important to you.",
        "A: To me, yeah. To me, yeah.",
        "Q: And do you think at the time it helped you, those humorous moments?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",

        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: About -- about the Holocaust, about your experiences?",
        "A: I remember how I -- how I learned to steal, you know? You learn -- you learn everything in\nthe concentration camp. You learn how to steal, oh yeah. I run after breakfast. I always had two\nbreakfasts, when they did bring the milk by in the morning, I waited for them by the\n[indecipherable] pass by and boom, took some out. Had to drink it and run back to the block to\nhave my second breakfast. When I did something wrong, they didn\u2019t send me to work, so I will\nnot get a second potato, but I had to go to pick up the potatoes, somebody has to go. I have so\nmany potatoes, oh God, yeah. It was not easy, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Has it been difficult during this interview for you to remember certain things?",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you would like to share? Any other memories?",
        "A: I only know one thing. I was happy. And my sister did find me to the Vatican. And when I\nwent to see her, finally came to Italy to be with her. She passed away last year, in August.",
        "Q: Was she here in the United States?",
        "A: Yeah. Last year in August, she passed away.",
        "Q: So you were able to have reunions with both of your siblings, your brother and your sister?",
        "A: Well, my brother was very ill. He got the lung cancer, and I did find him. He [indecipherable]\nmanufacturer f-from plastics, and if you went in there, the fumes were terrible. And when my\nlate husband told him, \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there without a mask,\u201d he said, \u201c[indecipherable] but\nthey are not stupid. If I go in with a mask, tomorrow I have nobody, no workers coming in any\nmore.\u201d So he got a lung cancer. I did find him dead, yeah.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Was that something you wanted in your life?",
        "A: First I didn\u2019t want any, and later I couldn\u2019t get any.",
        "Q: But it sounds like you\u2019ve been surrounded by close friends.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I -- always what I had, very good friends. And I was a good friend myself.",
        "Q: Well, I think I\u2019ve asked you all the questions I was planning to ask, and I -- \u2019'd welcome any\nother thoughts, if you\u2019d like to tell me any -- any other memories or thoughts if you want to\nshare. What was the kind of work that you did in the U.S.?",
        "A: I was 19 and a half years the Society for the Advancement of Education. We published the\noldest educational magazine in the United States.",
        "Q: And what was your job there?",
        "A: I was office manager, and assistant treasurer.",

        "Q: I\u2019m going to take a quick break. Okay, we were starting to talk about you beginning to go into\nhiding, and I wanted to make sure I understood approximately when was this? How long after\nthe anschluss? Was it a year or two after, or -- or sooner than that? Do you -- did you go into\nhiding in 1938, or was it later?",
        "Q: Think it may have been closer to 1941, does that seem right?",
        "Q: So, from 1938 to 1941, were things getting more and more difficult all the time?",
        "Q: And are there any examples that come to mind? What -- what sorts of things were happening?",
        "Q: Were you actively trying to leave the country?",
        "Q: But after that didn\u2019t work out, did you try other things?",
        "Q: And then at some point you started looking into the option of going into hiding.",
        "Q: And your husband was mostly in charge of looking for those arrangements?",
        "Q: Now, you already told me a little bit about receiving some kind of order, a relocation order.\nWhat did that say? What was the relocation order that you received?",
        "Q: I thought you said you and your husband also received a relocation order.",
        "Q: So when you received your -- the relocation order, what did it say? How long did it give you\nin order to relocate? Was it very short period of time?",
        "Q: I guess what I\u2019m curious to know is, did you have to go into hiding very quickly?",
        "Q: So does that mean you moved out of your apartment entirely?",
        "Q: So the first place you went into hiding in 1941, can you give a physical sort of description,\nwhatever your memory can recall.",

        "Q: Ah yeah, that\u2019s right. Her mother\u2019s brother, yeah. I-Ignatz. He was 13, and I said on that day,\nyou know, family should be together, so the grandparents they were in hiding already, and we\narranged they should come late in the evening while everybody goes home, and we will have a\nlittle celebration. And they never came, because they were arrested in the morning.",
        "Q: I think actually we -- we haven\u2019t talked about this yet during the interview. Maybe you can\nexplain wh-who are these family members, or who are these friends you are referring to. Can you\ntell me a little bit about your friends Ann and Ignatz?",
        "Q: How did you meet them, or how long did you know them?",
        "Q: Yes, because you started to talk about her brother, so I just wanted you to give a little\nintroduction to both of them.",
        "Q: So when you first went into hiding with your husband, were you also in hiding with Ann and\nher brother?",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay. Can you --",
        "Q: What was the 19\" of May?",
        "Q: And what happened on that day?",
        "Q: And did you know that? Did everybody know that?",
        "Q: And how did you deal with this news?",
        "Q: How did you cope? How did you deal with this news?",
        "Q: And this is when -- his birthday, Ignatz\u2019s birthday, May 19, that\u2019s -- at that time you were all\nin hiding together?",
        "Q: Were you already in hiding with your husband?",
        "Q: Tell me about the conditions of this hiding place. Did you have a lot of space, or a very little\nbit of space? What were the conditions like?",

        "Q: In -- in the outhouse, you said.",
        "Q: Sorry, in this little building, right?",
        "Q: Were you all sleeping in one room?",
        "Q: And where did you go to the bathroom, it was close by?",
        "Q: And you said there was an outhouse, or you just went outside and went to the bathroom\noutdoors.",
        "Q: And what did you do for food back there?",
        "Q: And was this woman Jewish, or not Jewish?",
        "Q: So she was helping you, she knew that you were in hiding?",
        "Q: Were there a number of non-Jewish people helping you?",
        "Q: They knew that you were in hiding?",
        "Q: So, you were able to get food. Do you remember being hungry while you were in hiding, or\nyou had enough food?",
        "Q: And did you have a kitchen, did you cook?",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about her, the person who was keeping you in hiding.",
        "Q: So what did you do?",
        "Q: He must have done what?",
        "Q: You think he\u2019s the reason you were found?",
        "Q: But the -- but the woman was very good to you?",
        "Q: Now, before I ask you about -- about that time, I just want to try to capture more details while\nyou were actually still in hiding. Why -- why did you leave -- is her name Pukas -- Pukas? Why\ndid you leave, from time to time, from her hiding place?",
        "Q: She told you you would need to leave?",
        "Q: So where else did you go when you would leave?",
        "Q: Did you go to other hiding places as well?",
        "Q: Only those two, so this -- this one couple, or the woman who --",
        "Q: -- had the laundry --",
        "Q: -- business. So you spent most of the time at the woman\u2019s place, or with the couple?",
        "Q: Did you do any work while you were staying with her?",
        "Q: Now, tell me how you were feeling? Every day were you worried and afraid, or what was\nyour feeling at the time?",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about the two children who were with you.",
        "Q: And how old were they? Well, he was 13 you said, and she was --",
        "Q: So every night you became a teacher?",
        "Q: So do you feel like during this time in hiding, were there also times where things were not as,\nyou know, heavy and worrisome? Did you have any lighter moments?",
        "Q: Were there any humorous stories while you were in hiding?",
        "Q: Can you tell me about those?",
        "Q: At the time now you\u2019re -- you\u2019re laughing about it, but were you very worried at that time?",
        "Q: You thought you might actually get caught that night.",
        "Q: And it was just the two of you women? Or she was a girl and you were a young woman.",
        "Q: Just the two of you out on the streets?",
        "Q: How often did you go out like that?",
        "Q: Were you worried -- were you wearing the Jewish Star of David at that time?",
        "Q: So you were trying to pass as non-Jewish?",
        "Q: Did anyone ever talk to you and say anything to you, and indicate that they thought you were\nJewish?",
        "Q: Was there anything about your appearance that made it easier for you to pass in the streets as\nnon-Jewish?",
        "Q: And what about your friend, Ann?",
        "Q: So do you think this was very helpful in allowing you to go 1n the streets?",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne Windholm,\nconducted by Amy Rubin on November 18, 2005, in Manhattan, New York. This is tape number\ntwo, side A. Okay, I\u2019m going to continue asking you a little more about your time in hiding. And\nI\u2019m wondering, during this entire time, I have the impression that you first went into hiding in\n1941?",
        "Q: And -- and you were s -- you stayed in hiding until 1944. So a lot was happening during this\ntime, and I\u2019m wondering what did you know about the war, and what was going on.",
        "Q: Say that again? There was supposed to be?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So while -- I -- I knew that you were listening to the radio before you went into hiding, but\neven while you were in hiding, you still listened?",
        "Q: And was that -- you listened right in that little building?",
        "Q: So what were your conversations mostly about while you were in hiding? Did you talk\nprimarily about the war?",
        "Q: Did you feel like you were becoming a -- a sort of mother to these children? You were taking\ncare of them.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk about sort of strategies about how you were trying to survive this entire\ntime? You know, walking out on the streets, did you have strategies where you would go, how\nyou would walk?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Are you saying you didn\u2019t want to walk on the sidewalk?",
        "Q: Because that\u2019s how it was in Vienna?",
        "Q: So as you walked around Vienna, when you would come out of hiding from time to time, how\ndid the city feel to you? What were the differences? How did it change?",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m talking about while you were in hiding. Weren\u2019t you s -- in Vienna the entire time?",
        "Q: So how did the city change during those war years? Did it feel like a different city to you?",
        "Q: Well, what about air raids during the war? Did you experience those in Vienna?",
        "Q: And you\u2019re saying there were mice in the attic?",
        "Q: Were you afraid too?",
        "Q: Now, I think I heard another story, and I\u2019m not sure exactly the details, but something about a\nman and the bathtub, the water in the bathtub. Is that a story that you remember while you were\nin hiding? I think 1t was a man who drank the water.",
        "Q: Okay, I -- I guess I misunderstood something I think Deborah was telling me, but maybe I just\ngot it wrong. So that doesn\u2019t sound familiar to you?",
        "Q: Did you have any other people who came and joined you during hiding, or was only the four\nof you at all times?",
        "Q: And did you feel like you always trusted this woman who was keeping you in hiding?",
        "Q: So while you were working in this laundry, did you have to make sure that nobody else would\nsee you? How difficult was that? People in the neighborhood, were you worried about that?",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your training to become a nurse, I believe.",
        "Q: So this is -- this is much later, this is after the end of the war?",
        "Q: Now, while you\u2019re in hiding, what were some of the dreams or hopes? What were you hoping\nwould happen, that you would still leave the country?",
        "Q: What were you dreaming could happen or would happen, that you could still leave the\ncountry?",
        "Q: So while you were in hiding, were there any other -- did you just think you would stay in\nhiding the entire time of the war? Was that your strategy and your hope?",
        "Q: Now tell me about the day when -- when they came and found you where you were in hiding.\nWhat -- what exactly happened?",
        "Q: Do you have any idea about who -- who told the Gestapo that you were there?",
        "Q: And you think this woman agreed to let him do that?",
        "Q: So, as much as you can remember the details, what exactly happened when you got arrested?",
        "Q: Now where was that?",
        "Q: But you said you were living in an open place, but you were in jail the whole time?",
        "Q: And what were you thinking during this time period?",
        "Q: Did you know what would happen next?",
        "Q: You knew specifically that you would be sent to Auschwitz? Or perhaps to somewhere else?",
        "Q: So while you were in jail, you felt there was nothing you could do about it, you just had to\nwait?",
        "Q: When were you arrested, do you remember\u201d? It\u2019s 1944, I think.",
        "Q: So what happened next when you -- when you were then deported? Tell me as many of the\ndetails as you can remember.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the day when you were deported from the jail?",
        "Q: As you were leaving on the transport?",
        "Q: Was it a difficult journey?",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what direction you were heading in? Where you were going?",
        "Q: But you got on the train and you didn\u2019t know where, exactly.",
        "Q: And when did you know that you were going there? Only when you arrived, or right before?",
        "Q: So how long did the trip take, the transport?",
        "Q: Were you uncomfortable on that ride, or just --",
        "Q: Just frightened. And what were your first impressions upon arriving to Auschwitz?",
        "Q: That\u2019s the last time you saw him?",
        "Q: And when did you learn what -- what actually happened, or did you not even learn anything\nabout him?",
        "Q: How were you able to -- to go on after that?",
        "Q: What happened, you were trying to reach for some food?",
        "Q: What happened again? You were trying to reach for some food? What happened with this SS\nwoman? You were trying to get some food?",
        "Q: How was your physical health during that whole time in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: How long were you in Auschwitz? When did you arrive there?",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little more when you first arrived, what kind of process did they put you,\nand -- and who else were you still with? Were you with Ann and Ignatz?",
        "Q: So did you stay with Ann, your friend?",
        "Q: And do you remember, did you go through the showers? What -- what sort of process did they\nput all of you through?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: You mean, you knew how difficult things would be there?",
        "Q: Because this was someone you knew and he wouldn\u2019t even let you keep your shoes?",
        "Q: And he was -- he was one of the Jewish prisoners, is that right?",
        "Q: Did you see a lot of Jewish prisoners being very mean to other Jewish prisoners?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So in your -- in your barracks, was it mostly other Jewish women from Austria, or was it a\nreal combination of different --",
        "Q: And they were allowed to sing? Nobody was keeping them from doing that?",
        "Q: So you must have been around a lot of women you couldn\u2019t even speak with because of the\nlanguages.",
        "Q: Were there other women there who spoke German? You could communicate?",
        "Q: And were you with your friend Ann in the barracks?",
        "Q: Did you still feel like you were taking care of her, looking out for her?",
        "Q: So it sounds like you tried very hard to stay clean all the time.",
        "Q: Were these the kind of conversations you would have almost every day?",
        "Q: Was there any part of normal life that was able to continue, or not?",
        "Q: In Auschwitz.",
        "Q: And what did you do during that time?",
        "Q: What kind of work were you doing?",
        "Q: You mean, some kind of job you had standing in water?",
        "Q: And were these jobs --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMarianne Windholm. This is tape two, side B. Okay, I think there are a couple stories while you\nwere in Auschwitz that I\u2019d be interested in learning more about. I think there\u2019s a story that has\nsomething to do with potatoes. Can you tell me more about that?",
        "Q: And that was very unusual, right?",
        "Q: Now where did you put these potatoes, since we\u2019re doing only an audio recording, I know\nyou showed me visually, but where did you keep these potatoes?",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about under your arms, right?",
        "Q: Inside your blouse -- inside your shirt.",
        "Q: So were you not as hungry during those days with the potatoes?",
        "Q: When you were working, were you working side by side with your friend, Ann?",
        "Q: She was somewhere else?",
        "Q: Now, there\u2019s another story, I think, about one of your socks. You had something special in\none of your socks?",
        "Q: What was the curfew, what time? Was it early, pretty early?",
        "Q: But you would not have gotten in trouble for being out before the curfew and running over\nthere, to the other area?",
        "Q: And how did you get these 20 soups? You would go back to somewhere in ke -- you got\nsoups every day?",
        "Q: It sounds like you were pretty resourceful during this difficult time. Do you feel that you\nwere?",
        "Q: Do you think being resourceful like that you were able to eat more and stay stronger?",
        "Q: It sounds like you were able to get more food at certain times, and maybe that kept you\nstronger.",
        "Q: And how much did you usually weigh?",
        "Q: So you were extremely weak?",
        "Q: Now did you -- did you observe any -- any sort of religious observances during this time in\nAuschwitz, privately, or did you pray at all?",
        "Q: Did you regard yourself as a religious person?",
        "Q: Yes, I think so. Did you feel that you had a belief in God during this time?",
        "Q: Did you ever let your emotions really get to you during this time in Auschwitz, or did you just\ntry to stay so strong emotionally?",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t have to work that day, or did they make you work?",
        "Q: But you still had to work?",
        "Q: Did you have any nightmares during this time? Was it just every night, how did you sleep?",
        "Q: And when they did the appelle, the roll call, what was that like?",
        "Q: Were you scared about being selected and taken away?",
        "Q: Did you see a lot of people being selected?",
        "Q: Did you ever witness anything very violent, any -- any killings while you were there?",
        "Q: Did you think a lot about the possibility of death during this time, or did you try to avoid\nthose thoughts?",
        "Q: Did you try to avoid thoughts about death, or did you think about death?",
        "Q: Did others do that as well, or were you one of the only ones?",
        "Q: Did you ever get seriously ill during this time?",
        "Q: Any kind of sickness?",
        "Q: That\u2019s at liberation?",
        "Q: Well, before liberation, while you were still in Auschwitz, did you witness or at all participate\nin any resistance activities?",
        "Q: Were you aware of them going on?",
        "Q: What about something like there was this Sonderkommando uprising in October of \u201944, did\nyou know about that at the time?",
        "Q: What did you know about that?",
        "Q: Ye -- are you talking about Ann\u2019s brother, Ignatz?",
        "Q: And what happened to him?",
        "Q: Were you with Ann the entire time while you were at Auschwitz?",
        "Q: While you were at Auschwitz, how much were you able to learn or hear about the war going\non?",
        "Q: But other than that, you really didn\u2019t have any more news?",
        "Q: Did you make other friends while you were in Auschwitz?",
        "Q: So even in the midst of everything going on, you are able to read things like poetry\nsometimes?",
        "Q: Did that help you to feel more human again, you think?",
        "Q: And how often were you able to do things like that?",
        "Q: And which friend is this? Her name?",
        "Q: Now, were you also talking about hopes for the future, perhaps even finding family members\nduring your time at Auschwitz?",
        "Q: While you were there, were you talking to your friends, to others, about your hopes for the\nfuture? Were you able to try to think about the future at all?",
        "Q: Can you tell me what happened with your sister during the war?",
        "Q: Your brother went to Venezuela, right?",
        "Q: But after -- after all of that, during the whole war, the rest of the war, what -- what happened\nwith your sister?",
        "Q: So she avoided going to -- to concentration camps?",
        "Q: Well when was this? When did you go there?",
        "Q: Now, I have just a couple more questions about your time in Auschwitz. Often I\u2019ve heard that\n-- that survivors remember certain smells or noises that for the rest of their lives, there are certain\nthings that are very vivid in this way, and I was wondering, have there ever been any certain\nnoises or smells that remind you?",
        "Q: So you -- you didn\u2019t experience it that way?",
        "Q: And what about the -- the crematorium? Were you able to see this on a regular basis?",
        "Q: It was close by to where you were?",
        "Q: And you always knew what was happening there?",
        "Q: And was there a terrible smell?",
        "Q: So --",
        "Q: Now, did you know at the time that that was Mengele or did you learn later?",
        "Q: Did you continue to encounter him while you were at Auschwitz, or only that one time?",
        "Q: So now, the day of liberation, can you tell me exactly what happened, and were you expecting\nanything like this? Did you know what was about to happen?",
        "Q: So what happened that day? Exactly wh-what was it like for you?",
        "Q: This is liberation in -- in January, right, of 1945.",
        "Q: And who -- who liberated --",
        "Q: And how old are you at this point? I guess you were born in 1910.",
        "Q: So maybe 34, something --",
        "Q: How did the -- how did the Russians treat you?",
        "Q: Was that a difficult journey?",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "Q: You were in a train?",
        "Q: Well, before you left Auschwitz, what was it like when -- when they first liberated the camp?\nDo you remember what happened to the -- to the guards, the commanders, the purp --",
        "Q: Did you see this happening?",
        "Q: This concludes part one of the interview with Marianne Windholm. Part two begins on the\nnext tape, tape three, side A.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is part two of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Marianne\nWindholm, conducted by Amy Rubin on December third, 2005, in Manhattan, New York. This\nis tape number three, side A. Okay, so we\u2019re going to continue with the interview, and I\u2019d just\nlike to ask you a few es -- about a few specific stories, a few anecdotes, and I have a little list\nhere, so I\u2019m just going to ask you a few, and then you can tell me what you remember about\nthese stories.",
        "Q: One of them is something to do with your father coming home from the war, and I\u2019m\npresuming that\u2019s World War I, right?",
        "Q: Well, tell me about that.",
        "Q: How old -- how old were you?",
        "Q: And did you not recognize your father?",
        "Q: Now there\u2019s another little anecdote I wanted to ask you about, and it --",
        "Q: -- something to do with the theater.",
        "Q: With the theater -- with the theater.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, why don\u2019t you say it first in Yiddish, and then you can translate it.",
        "Q: They threw you out of the theater?",
        "Q: But why, why did they do that?",
        "Q: So these are some of the fond memories you have from Vienna?",
        "Q: What about the anecdote about Mother\u2019s day?",
        "Q: Well these are some of the stories that Mazie encouraged me to ask you.",
        "Q: Did she enjoy it?",
        "Q: Well, it sounds like you had a lot of good fun and good memories in your home.",
        "Q: There\u2019s another story, I believe about your mother, a humorous story, something about don\u2019t\ngive her away\u201d?",
        "Q: Were you interested in going?",
        "Q: Now, what about another anecdote about when your mother was sick, and you had to cook?",
        "Q: How old were you? Were you very young?",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your maid, were you close to her?",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "Q: And she stayed with you for a long time?",
        "Q: So your family was pretty well off financially, to have a maid?",
        "Q: Now, I believe there\u2019s another story here. Maybe you already told me the one about boiling\nthe water, but what about baking the chicken?",
        "Q: Baking the chicken. Mazie said there was a story you wanted to share about baking chicken,\nno?",
        "Q: I think when you had to cook for your mother? You don\u2019t remember?",
        "Q: Okay. And what about another -- this is the final anecdote I wanted to ask you about. Your\nfirst doll, and your brother did something with it.",
        "Q: You took her to the doll hospital?",
        "Q: Were you very upset, as a child?",
        "Q: And it was probably unusual to have a doll that spoke at that time.",
        "Q: Well, thank you for sharing those stories. Now, I want to ask you some more questions that I\nhad here, prepared. And I wanted to make sure because I -- I don\u2019t remember from our first\nsession together, can you just make sure to tell me your husband\u2019s name?",
        "Q: Ah well, I know you were married twice --",
        "Q: -- but your first husband.",
        "Q: And so that became your last name for awhile as well?",
        "Q: Now, I wanted to return where we left off in our interview. We were talk -- we were starting\nto talk about the time of liberation at Auschwitz.",
        "Q: But I wanted to make sure that I had a -- some information even before we got to that point. I\ndon\u2019t know if you know this by heart, or if we could somehow put this in the interview, but do\nyou know the -- the registration number, the tattoo number that they gave to you?",
        "Q: Okay, it looks like A7 -- it\u2019s hard to read, but maybe another two.",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s 72, and then maybe a 25.",
        "Q: Does that sound --",
        "Q: -- familiar?",
        "Q: So it looks like A7225.",
        "Q: Is that a good thing, to forget the number?",
        "Q: Well, thank you for showing me. Now, when you were in Auschwitz, did you and others\naround you, did you ever have any kind of religious observance? Did you try in any way to -- to\nobserve --",
        "Q: And that must have been very difficult in the conditions you were in. Now -- now tell me\nmore about liberation. If you can sort of walk me through that time period, what you remember,\nand sort of set up the scene for me, what -- what exactly happened?",
        "Q: What was the next thing that you did?",
        "Q: How did you travel over those snowy areas, the mountains?",
        "Q: First of all, at the time of liberation, what was your feeling, what were your emotions? Was it\nhard to believe that this was happening?",
        "Q: Was it hard to believe that liberation was really happening when it happened? What were\nyour emotions at the time?",
        "Q: Tell me about the rest of the journey, how you got back home.",
        "Q: Is this in Vienna as well?",
        "Q: So that was your m -- that was your goal after the war, was to return to Vienna, right?",
        "Q: And did you spend -- after you were liberated from Auschwitz, did you spend from January til\nthe end of the war traveling around?",
        "Q: Were you scared during that time period?",
        "Q: So you stayed in Italy?",
        "Q: So you were just there for -- for a short time, for a short visit, in Italy.",
        "Q: Sure, what were you doing?",
        "Q: Well, I was there, I -- I had the job there. I went to the -- there were the kibbutzims. You\nknow what is a kibbutz?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s a lot.",
        "Q: Before -- before we go to the time when you came to the U.S., tell me a little more. When you\nfirst returned to Vienna, what was it like to talk with or interact with Austrians?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nMarianne Windholm. This is tape number three, side B. What I wanted to ask you about is, every\nday Austrians, people in the streets, people you would meet, people who were not Jewish, did\nyou -- was it difficult to interact with them after the war? Did you feel resentment?",
        "Q: What about the people who kept you in hiding before you were sent to Auschwitz? Did you\nget in contact with any of them?",
        "Q: When you -- when you returned to Vienna after the war --",
        "Q: -- did you contact them?",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "Q: How did you emotionally deal with that at the time?",
        "Q: Now, after the war, when you came back to Vienna --",
        "Q: -- was it -- was it nice to see the woman who hid you, what was that like to see her again?",
        "Q: Who 1 -- who is Anna Vietner?",
        "Q: Was she Jewish, or not?",
        "Q: And she was --",
        "Q: And that helped her get through the war?",
        "Q: So she helped you when you got back to Vienna?",
        "Q: And did you search for other relative -- for relatives of yours?",
        "Q: And what about your mom -- your mother, did you already know what had happened?",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019m just wondering when did you learn about -- about what happened with your\nmother?",
        "Q: Did you ever try to find her at Auschwitz?",
        "Q: Was that while you were still there, or after?",
        "Q: When did it become clear to you -- was it already after the war, how massive the Holocaust\nreally was?",
        "Q: How -- how massive the Holocaust really was, how many Jews, how many people were really\nvictimized.",
        "Q: You never had hot water?",
        "Q: So, back to Vienna after the war, it sounds like you spent a considerable amount of time in\nItaly, and then you had returned to Vienna on the weekends, and about how long did -- did this\ngo on for?",
        "Q: And how long did you stay in Italy?",
        "Q: And were you happier living in Italy than Vienna?",
        "Q: Were you still thinking you might return to live in Vienna someday?",
        "Q: Why would you --",
        "Q: -- why did you know you didn\u2019t want to live there any more?",

        "A: Well, she was very surprised to see me, and I don\u2019t know, we were denounced from\nsomebody. Because we were there for a long, long time, and we used -- we have to go away from\ntime to time to stay someplace else for a week, then we came back. But somebody denounced us,\nand we were arrested there. We came back at five o\u2019clock in -- in the afternoon, at four o\u2019clock\nin the morning the Gestapo came and arrested us. And then we came to Auschwitz, and then we\nwere selected. My husband went here, I here. I said, \u201cI want to go with my husband.\u201d Mengele\nwas sitting there, and he said, \u201cBe glad you are not going.\u201d And I never will forget the color of\nmy husband\u2019s face, gray. He knew. And I knew where he is going, yeah.",
        "A: I never will be able to tell you, because I knew what will happen to him, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, I can\u2019t remember, I tell you. I went with other people to [indecipherable] because the\nIsraeli [indecipherable] there was a letter from Anna Vietner, whom I know. It said, whoever\nknows Anna Vietner should go there and there. And when I came there, they were hidden al --\nth-through the whole war. She, her mother.

And I had to clean my hand to open the elevator. And the\nsuper come out and said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I am going up to see Mother. She was picked\nup last evening. And she was in Theresienstadt. And I knew the superintendent in other district,\nand I spoke with her and we did make packages and mail them to Theresienstadt. And she\nreceived it, I know that, because one day, maybe after one and a half years, was a long time she\nwas there, maybe a year or so, a red letter came back that she was relocated. Then I knew that\nshe went to Auschwitz.",
        "A: How could I?",
        "A: No, I knew that she is not alive. Children and old people they gassed right away. We knew\nthat. We did listen to the British sender. We knew exactly what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: How what?",
        "A: I -- I knew it. I knew it from Auschwitz. We had selections, when you had one pimple on\nyour body -- you know, they were so afraid of scabies, because we were a labor force which\ndidn\u2019t cost any money. We worked very hard. So if they -- you had one pimple on your body,\nyou went, yeah. Were selections very often, I would say at least once a week. We washed at\nnight. When we came back from work, we worked very hard, cleaning stones and everything.\nWhen we came back, in the washrooms, that water was dripping, no water. We couldn\u2019t even\nclean ourself. And one night I woke up, I saw two from our block that was where we were\nstaying, block 13, go out -- everybody has a towel. I run after them and they went into the\nwashrooms and that water was flowing. There was water and water [indecipherable] then I woke\nup Annie, we went every night, we washed from top to bottom with ice cold water, but we\nkeeped ourselves clean, yeah.",

        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t want to go there. I -- I told you I went there [indecipherable] I wouldn\u2019t be\nthere, no. I was there once, after the war, on a trip to Europe. No.",

        "A: Well, she was with me all the time, for a long time. But then we were separated. And I, very\nsoon, was liberated, but she still was not liberated where she was. They had a selection, she went\non transport, and I did remain. That was the night where they gassed all the Gypsies, yeah. Killed\nthem, all the Gypsies.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I suppose so. Was in Vienna, yeah. She\u2019s not from Vienna, you know, Ann Green. She\u2019s from\nthe little town Noyen Kyrklund. She\u2019s not Viennese.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah. I told her, when we came to Auschwitz, and she came to me very upset, showing\nme she had in her panties, in the seams she did find a louse. So I said to her, \u201cAnnie, listen to me,\nif I will take care of your lice, I will not be able to take care of mine. You will not live and I will\nnot live. If you will listen to me and do whatever I tell you, maybe we will make it.\u201d And that\nhow it was. We went every night, I woke her up, let\u2019s go and wash, because then the water was\nflowing. We had never water when we came home from work. But at night we had no towel,\nnothing. But we were undressed, we washed from top to bottom, yeah, every night.",

        "A: Sure, it\u2019s still too difficult. If you were in Auschwitz, you learn how to steal. You know,\neverybody likes to survive. So whatever you see you could steal, you steal. You don\u2019t have a bad\nconscious if you do that.",
        "A: No. Sometimes I do think about it, but I didn\u2019t think about it at all because my life was full,\nyou know, after the war. I had a good life, I was happily married. But now, sometimes I do\nremember, yeah.",
